    "title": "Lagoa dos Patos inunda bairros; RS tem mais de 400 mil fora de casa por causa das chuvas - 10/05/2024 | Diário do Grande ABC",
    "text": "Mais de 400 mil gaúchos estão fora de casa afetados pela maior tragédia climática do Estado. Nesta sexta-feira, 10, a Defesa Civil divulgou que 337.116 pessoas estão desalojadas e outras 69.617 em abrigos. O aumento na quantidade de afetados pelas enchentes ocorre em um momento de elevação do nível da Lagoa dos Patos e queda de temperatura no Estado. A Defesa Civil emitiu na noite desta quinta-feira (9) um alerta com a orientação para quem mora em regiões próximas à lagoa, ou em áreas com histórico de alagamentos ou inundações, para que saiam de suas casas com antecedência e busquem um local seguro. No município de Rio Grande, por exemplo, vários bairros estão inundados. As principais ruas do entorno do centro histórico estão bloqueadas. O nível da lagoa vem aumentando nos últimos dias e chegou a 1,84m às 16h de quinta-feira em Rio Grande, de acordo com os registros do Serviço Geológico do Brasil. O Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet) em conjunto com o Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais (Cemaden), o Centro Nacional de Gerenciamento de Riscos e Desastres (Cenad) e o Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Inpe) também emitiram na quinta-feira uma nota técnica na qual alertam sobre os riscos geo-hidrológicos, sobretudo na região da Lagoa dos Patos, que recebe as águas dos rios e do Guaíba. De acordo com os órgãos, o avanço de uma frente por Santa Catarina e a entrada de um ar mais frio pelo Rio Grande do Sul provocaram queda de temperatura no Estado e uma virada dos ventos \"desfavorecendo o escoamento da água da lagoa em direção ao oceano, desta forma, a preparação dos municípios para inundação gradual na região de Pelotas, Rio Grande e arredores deve ser redobrada.\" Frio Ainda segundo o Inmet, as temperaturas mínimas variam de 4°C a 8°C nas regiões mais ao Sul do Estado. Nas demais áreas, as temperaturas mínimas variam de 10°C a 15°C. O frio é considerado um problema adicional em meio à tragédia climática por causa do risco de hipotermia às pessoas que ainda não foram resgatadas. Atenção! Os comentários do site são via Facebook.

    "title": "60-day notice, DM verification, jail threat in Chhattisgarh conversion bill — but not for ‘ghar wapsi’",
    "text": "60-day notice, DM verification, jail threat in Chhattisgarh conversion bill — but not for ‘ghar wapsi’\nNew Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Chhattisgarh government’s proposed law to regulate religious conversions in the state is largely silent on the subject of reconversion or ghar wapsi.\nThis has been highlighted by a few Christian organisations, which see the provisions of the law as against the constitutional freedom to propagate one’s religion, and as going soft on the BJP-RSS’s ghar wapsi campaign to bring people “back” to Hinduism.\nIn cases of reconversion, the draft suggests merely informing the district administration. There is no requirement for any prior notice, police verification or personal appearance before the district magistrate.\nSpeaking to ThePrint, the spokesperson of a church in tribal-dominated Bastar district said, “The Constitution guarantees the freedom to practise and propagate one’s religion. A person also has the freedom to convert. How will you establish forceful conversion? We are against any forceful conversion but using police and state power to regulate conversion is also coercion. It is threatening the community for political benefit.”\nThe proposed law, which has been drafted as a bill, was announced by state minister Brijmohan Agrawal in the assembly last week. It empowers the police to “verify the real intention and purpose” behind conversion and suggests fines and jail time of up to 10 years for “illegal conversion”. This comes in the backdrop of the BJP’s charge that conversions — mainly of the Adivasis to Christianity — had risen in Chhattisgarh under the previous Congress government.\nThe legislation is also significant as the Lok Sabha polls loom and the BJP makes efforts to consolidate the votes of tribal people, who are estimated to make up more than 30 percent of the state’s population. The law will further fulfil the BJP’s poll promise to bring a comprehensive bill in the assembly to check conversion.\nThe draft bill states that conversion “cannot be done from one religion to another by the use or practice of abuse, force, undue influence, coercion, inducement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage”.\nThose found forcefully converting minors, women, people from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will face a minimum punishment of two years and a maximum of 10 years in jail as well as fine of Rs 50,000 for mass conversion, sources in the Chhattisgarh government told ThePrint.\nThe burden of proof that a conversion was not illegal will be on the person who conducts the ritual, according to the draft bill, which also states that for reconversion, only intimation is enough, no verification is required and no penalty has been proposed.\nThe bill stipulates that a person who wishes to convert to another religion will have to fill in a form with personal details at least 60 days in advance and submit it to the district magistrate (DM), who will direct the police to ascertain the real intention behind the “dharmantaran”. The DM will also maintain a registry of all converts, the sources said.\nThe person who performs the conversion ceremony will have to fill in a form at least a month in advance, while the person converting will have to present himself/herself before the DM for verification within 60 days of conversion. In case of objection by relatives or an adopted child, an FIR can be registered and charges will be non-bailable, according to the sources.\nLast month, chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai, who comes from the tribal-dominated Jashpur region, had alleged that Christian missionaries were carrying out mass conversions of tribal people in the state.\n“Due to Dilip Singh Judeoji’s ghar wapsi campaign, Jashpur district has been protected. Otherwise, Asia’s second largest church is in our area and conversion take place rapidly,” he said.\nThe late Judeo, a BJP leader and former Union minister, had started the ghar wapsi campaign in Chhattisgarh. He would wash the feet of those who had converted to Christianity at highly publicised events, and facilitate their “re-entry” into Hinduism.\nLast year, ahead of the Chhattisgarh polls, home minister and BJP leader Amit Shah had also said that the “Congress government has made poor tribals change their religion and the BJP will bring a strong law to check conversion”. Earlier, in 2015, Shah, who was then the BJP president, had said “the (BJP-led central) government can bring a central law to check conversion but has left it to states to bring out such a strict law”.\nAgrawal told the media last week: “The government is committed towards checking conversion and the BJP promised the electorate that it would bring such a law after the polls. That is why it will table the bill in the assembly. Conversion has become a serious issue in tribal areas.”\nPolitical analysts, however, said that convictions for forceful conversions were low and the law seemed an eyewash to satisfy Right-wing voters.\nFaizan Mustafa, former vice-chancellor of NALSAR University of Law, told ThePrint: “Many states have strict anti-conversion laws but they haven’t been able to convict a large number of people to show that conversion is happening at a mass level. The data doesn’t substantiate these claims. Also, most state laws are silent on the reconversion issue. It is more like the optics of the political party.”\nThe rival Congress too said the Sai government was bringing the bill to consolidate its tribal constituency and that conviction rate was low for forceful conversions.\nParty MLA Umesh Patel said a “witch hunt should not be done to make the BJP constituency happy”.\n“The BJP says that mass conversions are happening, but where are the convictions for such cases,” he asked.\n‘Forceful conversion is a big issue’ The BJP has in the past few years built up a narrative about the threat of religious conversion among the tribal population. Soon after its defeat in 2018, the party — together with the cadre of the RSS, which has an enormous presence in the tribal districts through the institution of the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram — began to raise the issue actively.\nAnother RSS affiliate is also holding a campaign to delist tribal people who become Christian from the ST list, so that they don’t get the benefit of reservation.\nRanvijay Judeo, a former BJP Rajya Sabha MP and the nephew of Dilip Judeo, told ThePrint that “forceful conversion is a big issue in the state and the BJP has long demanded a check on it”.\n“We are demanding to delist from the ST list such people who are using the benefit of reservation under the tribal category but have converted to Christianity. We are also demanding that a census should be conducted to ascertain the gravity of the issue. The converts should be stripped of all benefits. However, if anybody wants to make ghar wapsi, they can be allowed to return to their original religion without hinderance,” he added.\nThe Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh had in 2006 sought to introduce legal provisions to regulate conversion but they were held up by the then governor, reportedly over the stand on reconversion. The bill, Chhattisgarh Dharma Swantantraya Adhiniyam, said that the return of a person to their ancestors’ religion or their own religion couldn’t be construed as conversion.\nIn the current draft, most provisions are taken from the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act that criminalises religious conversion by “force, undue influence, coercion, or allurement”.\nThe UP law includes within its ambit marriage for the sake of religious conversion. According to the law, a marriage shall be declared “null and void” if it is found that its sole intention was to convert the woman.\nA similar provision on interfaith marriage as a means to carry out forced conversion had caused the Gujarat High Court to stay a similar bill in the state in 2021. The court stayed the law observing that the “burden of proof fell on the parties entering into interfaith marriage that it was not solemnised on account of any fraud, allurement or coercion”.\nChhattisgarh’s latest draft bill also has a clause on interfaith marriage that could face legal obstacles.\n(Edited by Nida Fatima Siddiqui)",

    "title": "Windows 11 to let you use your phone as a webcam | Digital Trends",
    "text": "The Windows 11 update 24H2 includes a new feature called Connected Camera that lets you turn your smartphone into a webcam. The folks at PCWorld have tested the feature out, and it looks pretty easy to use, though you do need to have an Android phone to use it.\nUsing your phone as a webcam — either for your desktop or your laptop — isn’t new, but native support for it has been patchy. At first, people had to use third-party apps to do the job. Then Apple users got Continuity Camera , and a few years later Android 14 users got a similar feature, too.\nRecommended Videos Now Windows has joined the club (late as always), giving us even more ways to ditch the grainy old laptop webcam for the fancy cameras we carry in our pockets. To try the feature out, you need a PC with Bluetooth running Windows 11 24H2 and a phone running Android 8.0 or later.\nStart by connecting your phone to the PC either using Phone Link or the Manage mobile devices controls. Both devices will need to be on the same Wi-Fi network, and you’ll need to agree to certain permissions, so your PC has access to your phone camera.\nOnce your phone appears under the My devices menu on the Manage mobile devices page, you’ll see a toggle option called Use as a connected camera . Toggle it on and your phone should appear as a webcam device in any video call app like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams.\nYou can use either your front-facing or rear camera to capture the footage, and the camera feed will automatically switch between vertical and landscape mode depending on how you hold your phone. If your PC supports Windows Studio Effects, they’ll still work even when you’re using your phone camera.\nAs expected for a new Windows feature, however, not everything works quite as it should. PCWorld noted that using the feature on a laptop resulted in a 720p resolution feed, even though the native webcam captured at 1080p. I’m sure Microsoft has added it to the list of Windows 11 24H2 issues it needs to fix.\nEditors’ Recommendations Another annoying bug is spoiling the fun in Windows 11 24H2 Microsoft is forced to halt the Windows 11 24H2 update on some PCs Windows 11 24H2 may crash your PC if you have a certain SSD Passkeys in Windows 11 are about to get safer and easier to use Windows 11 can now use AI to respond to your text messages",
