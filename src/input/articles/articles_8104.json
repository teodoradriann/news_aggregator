    "text": "The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to permit prayers at the recently demolished 'Akhoondji mosque' and the nearby graveyard in Mehrauli on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat. Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav, while dealing with an application by the Managing Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board, noted that the court has directed status quo on the site which is now in the possession of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). The application forms part of a petition by the committee on the issue of demolition. Justice Kaurav observed that the main petition, which was heard by the court on several occasions, is already listed for final disposal on March 7. \"At this stage, the court is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is dismissed,\" ordered the court. The 'Akhoondji mosque', believed to be over 600 years old, as well as the Behrul Uloom madrasa there were declared as illegal structures in Sanjay Van and demolished by the DDA on January 30. The counsel for the petitioner said worshippers, whose families are buried in the nearby graveyard, should be allowed offer prayers there on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat later this month. He said the mosque was several centuries old and prayers were being offered there for the last many years. There was also an \"active graveyard\" which was used by the locals, the advocate told the court. On February 5, the high court had asked the DDA to maintain status quo on the site where the mosque once stood. The petitioner committee has argued that the demolition of the mosque was illegal. The DDA has defended its action before the high court on the ground that the demolition took place pursuant to the January 4 recommendation of its Religious Committee. The decision, it said, was taken after the Religious Committee afforded an opportunity of hearing to the CEO of Delhi Waqf Board. The petitioner has, however, contended that the Religious Committee has no jurisdiction to order any demolition action. On January 31, the court asked the DDA to file its reply clearly setting out the action that has been taken in respect of the property concerned as well as its basis. It also asked the development authority to state whether any prior notice was given before the demolition.",

    "text": "According to controversial Ghanaian man of God, Prophet Nicholas Osei aka Kumchacha, there is nothing good about marriage.\nAccording to him, if Jesus, the son of God, had married a woman during his time on earth, he would have ended up missing a ticket to heaven.\nKumchacha made these claims during an interview with Ghanaian YouTuber and vlogger, Felix Adomako Mensah, who professionally goes by the name ZionFelix.\nAccording to him, marriage usually brings little benefit and is actually rife with problems. He claimed that the saviour of the world, Jesus Christ himself was aware of this which is why he stayed away from women during his time on Earth.\n“If marriage were easy, Jesus Christ would have married himself. If he had taken a wife, he might have missed heaven—especially if he had married a difficult woman,” he said.\nKumchacha added that there are many great men suffering in life because they made the wrong choice and married a ‘difficult’ woman.\nHis comment completely sparked hilarious reactions from netizens who were left laughing their bums off!\nOver the years, Kumchacha has become known for making such outrageous comments and his latest did not disappoint.",

    "text": "Bundle up, New Yorkers, because it's about to be unseasonably cold into the weekend, according to meteorologists. “ Typically, this time of the year a normal high would be somewhere around 45 degrees,” John Cristantello with the National Weather Service said on Friday. “For today, we're only going to be in the mid 30s.” Saturday and Sunday should warm up slightly, with Sunday’s highs in the low 40s, he said. But the real thaw-out won’t happen until the beginning of next week, when temperatures are expected to climb back into the 50s. “ On Monday and Tuesday, the winds are going to shift a little more from the south, and that should help push up the temperatures a bit,” Cristantello added. “So it'll actually be above normal on Monday.” The skies should stay dry and mostly sunny throughout the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. The New York region is still experiencing drought conditions despite the recent rains, experts told Gothamist this week.",
