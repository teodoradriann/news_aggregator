    "text": "Print this article Font size - 16 + Ashima : Mr Bajaj, would you please share your thoughts on your recent appointment as Additional Advocate General and what it means to you personally and professionally?\nSandeep Baja j: I am deeply honoured and humbled by my recent appointment as Additional Advocate General for State of Punjab in the Supreme Court of India. It is a privilege to serve the State in this capacity and to contribute my legal expertise for its well-being, which has been my home State. This opportunity to represent the State before the highest court of land carries significant personal and professional value.\nPersonally, it represents reward of years of hard work and my dedication to the legal profession. Professionally, it will allows me to leverage my experience and knowledge to make a positive impact on a broader scale by upholding the law and protecting the interests of the State.\nAshima : What vision or goals do you have for your tenure as AAG? Are there any specific initiatives or areas you plan to focus on?\nSandeep Bajaj : My primary goal is to serve as a steadfast pillar of justice for the society. This translates to ensuring fair and effective legal representation in all matters entrusted to the AAG's office.\nThe opportunity to represent the State before the Supreme Court of India will be a significant step forward in my professional journey. Appearing before the highest court of the land is not only a humbling honour but also an exceptional platform for my professional career. I believe that this new chapter in my career is not just a destination but rather a stepping stone to an ongoing journey of learning and growth.\nI envision fostering collaborative environment among all the law officers and other departments. This collaborative spirit will be crucial in tackling complex legal challenges and ensuring efficient case management.\nWhile being committed to excellence across all legal domains handled by the AAG, I intend to pay particular attention to specific areas where my experience can be most valuable. I also believe in promoting transparency and accessibility within the legal system.\nUltimately, I hope to leave a legacy of robust legal defence for the State while promoting ethical and professional conduct within the office.\nAshima : With over a decade of experience in managing a law firm, how do you anticipate leveraging your expertise in your new role?\nSandeep Bajaj : Before my foray into the Counsel Practice, I was fortunate to successfully spearhead PSL Advocates and Solicitors, as its Managing Partner. My experience as a Managing Partner and thereafter as Arguing Counsel has equipped me with a multifaceted skillset that I am confident will serve me well in my new role.\nAs a Managing Partner and thereafter as Arguing Counsel, I have always prioritized client satisfaction and building strong relationships. This has translated to a deep understanding of client needs and the ability to effectively advocate on their behalf. I believe that this client-centric approach will be valuable in representing the interests of the society to the best of my abilities.\nAshima : What are the typical characteristics of the legal matters handled by an AAG in ensuring a robust defence for the State Government? Additionally, could you provide insight into the operations within the office of an AAG? Can students/lawyers apply to work with you?\nSandeep Bajaj : The AAG office handles a diverse range of legal matters, including but not limited to constitutional issues, public interest litigation, and criminal matter. The work requires meticulous research, strategic analysis, and persuasive advocacy. Above all, I am incredibly happy and enthusiastic to work alongside and under the guidance of distinguished Advocate General.\nBeyond litigation, AAG provides legal advice to various government departments, ensuring their actions align with the law and established policies. This requires staying abreast of legal developments and offering clear, concise guidance.\nThe office of an AAG operates with a dynamic blend of teamwork and individual responsibility. We function as a close-knit unit, drawing on each other's strengths and expertise to tackle complex legal issues.\nWhile opportunities for law student’s direct involvement may be limited due to specific legal requirements, I would certainly encourage law students to reach out [to me/my office] and pursue internships to gain relevant experience.\nAshima : Any advice or messages for lawyers aspiring to pursue a similar career path?\nSandeep Bajaj : My journey wasn't linear. Building a successful Law Firm was valuable, but the switch to a Counsel Practice allowed me to focus on areas I truly wanted to delve into. Different experiences hone different skills, and each has its own rewards.\nThere's no one-size-fits-all approach to success. Ultimately, your success will depend on your own unique journey, driven by your passion, dedication, and willingness to learn and grow. Embrace the challenges, celebrate the victories, learn from mistakes and never lose sight of your own aspirations. It all forms part of a beautiful journey.",

(Photo by Chris DELMAS / AFP/File ) (AFP) The country's top cinema official raised the matter of slow speeds and disruptions on YouTube in Russia, so President Vladimir Putin took the initiative and directed the Kremlin officials to look into it, reported Reuters on Friday.\nAccording to critics, YouTube is being deliberately disrupted by the authorities to prevent Russians from viewing a mass of content there that is critical of Putin and his government.\nAlso Read | YouTuber couple dies hours after posting eerie video with song on ‘final…’ However, Russia denied the critics' accusations and stated the issues are caused by Google's failure to upgrade equipment—a charge disputed by the company and technology experts.\nIn the last few months, Russian internet monitoring services have reported mass outages of YouTube , an online video hosting service owned by Alphabet's Google. However, on Friday, communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it was not registering any changes in the quality of YouTube's service.\nMeanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the speed issue was linked to Google's failure to comply with Russian law and that technical questions should be addressed to Roskomnadzor.\nPeskov even said that YouTube speeds were not high on people's agendas in Russia.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nWhat Mosfilm said: Karen Shakhnazarov, who has headed the state-owned giant of Soviet and Russian cinema, Mosfilm, for more than 25 years, said on Thursday he had met with Putin and discussed the issue.\n\"Slowing down YouTube, in my view, is not very advisable today,\" Reuters quoted Shakhnazarov as saying on state television. \"To which the president said there are all sorts of nastiness on there.\"\nAccording to research company Mediascope, YouTube is used by more than 50 million Russians every day as it provides an important platform for the exiled Russian opposition and for independent news outlets.\nIn past few years, Google, along with other foreign tech firms and social media platforms, has been under pressure, as they have not taken down content Moscow considers illegal, such as what it calls \"fakes\" about the war in Ukraine.\nAlso Read | Elon Musk shares video claiming NATO expansion, not Russia, provoked Ukraine war Russia also strongly objects to Google blocking YouTube channels and videos from state-sponsored media.\nMeanwhile, Shakhnazarov agreed there were some bad things on YouTube, but that those who wanted to access them were able to get around restrictions and many others simply use the platform to watch films and other content.\n\"He listened and said 'I'll look into it',\" Shakhnazarov said.\nWith agency inputs.\nCatch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "text": "以伊停火后，伊朗至今仍未恢复此前正在与美国进行的核谈判。据新华社消息，美国国务卿鲁比奥14日与英国、法国及德国外长进行电话会商，同意将8月底设定为伊朗与美国达成核协议的最后期限，否则英法德三国将恢复对伊朗制裁。 据悉，根据2015年伊核问题全面协议，“快速恢复制裁”条款允许签署国采取措施应对伊朗的违规行为，该条款将于今年10月到期。由于启动“快速恢复制裁”程序需要30天，欧洲人希望在俄罗斯10月出任联合国安理会轮值主席国之前完成该程序。美国和欧洲官员将该条款视为向伊朗施压的谈判工具，也是外交努力失败后的退路。但伊朗方面认为，重新实施制裁缺乏法律依据，并威胁以退出《不扩散核武器条约》作为应对。 此外，欧洲国家打算在今后几天或几周内与伊朗接触，并表示如果伊朗采取措施让世界对其核计划放心，就可以避免“快速恢复制裁”。这些措施可能包括恢复国际原子能机构的核查监督。 对此，伊朗议会16日表示，伊朗不会恢复与美国中断的核谈判，除非对方满足伊朗提出的先决条件。 伊朗议会当天通过官方媒体发布一份声明，重申对伊美核谈的立场。声明说，美国把谈判当作“欺骗伊朗”、包庇以色列突袭伊朗的“工具”，伊美对话不能再像以前那样展开。“必须设定先决条件，全部条件被满足前，我们不会举行新的谈判。” 声明没有阐述伊方“先决条件”的具体内容。伊朗外交部长阿拉格齐6月底接受美国媒体采访时说，伊朗恢复与美国谈判的前提是确保美国不会再于谈判期间袭击伊朗。 当天，伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊表示，伊朗有能力对美国等方面实施更沉重的打击。 哈梅内伊16日在会见司法部门官员时发表讲话说，伊朗对美国袭击的反击是极其精准的打击，“目标是美国在地区内极其敏感的核心设施”。他说：“伊朗还能对美国及其他方面实施比这更沉重的打击。” 哈梅内伊表示，伊朗从过去到现在都不欢迎战争，但不论何时，面对敌人进攻，其反击都将是坚决有力的。他说，“以色列意识到自己无法应对伊朗”，若它有能力自卫，便不会向美国求助。他强调，有必要对以色列在近期战争中所犯“罪行”追究法律责任。",

    "text": "GRANDFATHER MOUNTAIN — Rescue personnel recently rescued multiple hikers in separate incidents.\nOn the afternoon of June 17, Linville-Central Rescue and NC Mountain Rescue Team 1 were alerted to a report of an injured hiker near Calloway Peak, below the Attic Window section of the Grandfather Trail in Grandfather Mountain State Park.\nResponding agencies included Linville Volunteer Fire Department, Avery County Fire Marshal/Emergency Management, Avery EMS, Banner Elk Volunteer Fire & Rescue, Grandfather Mountain State Park staff, and Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation. More than 26 mostly volunteer rescuers responded, either assisting with the operation of a trailhead command center or hiking up more than 800 vertical feet on the rugged Grandfather and Underwood Trails.\nAfter access and patient assessment it was decided a helicopter evacuation would be the best course of action. Emergency Management requested a team from SC HART (Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team) to respond to a hoist operation. Using a small 15-minute window of clear weather amid afternoon storm cells, a successful hoist of the patient was completed by both SC HART technicians and ground-based Mountain Rescue Team members. The SC HART team landed at a nearby landing zone set up by other first responders, and the patient was unloaded and transported to a medical center. Many thanks to all the volunteers and paid personnel who responded to help this person in their time of need.\nOn Sunday afternoon, June 22, Linville Central Rescue was requested to assist Caldwell County with an injured hiker on the Daniel Boone Scout Trail on Grandfather Mountain. Personnel responded with members of the Blowing Rock Fire Department. The subject was located and assessed and Caldwell Emergency Management decided the best course of action was to activate NC HART. The injured hiker was safely evacuated, and all rescuers made their way out of the woods to the command post shortly after 9 p.m.\nAgencies on this call included Linville-Central Rescue Squad, NC Mountain Rescue Team 1, Linville Volunteer Fire Department, Grandfather Mountain State Park, Blowing Rock Fire Department, NC Emergency Management, NC HART and Caldwell County Emergency Management.\nEarly on June 23, Burke County Emergency Management was notified of an injured hiker along the Conley Cove Trail. A swift and coordinated response was initiated involving Burke EMS, Burke EMS Special Operations, Burke Rescue, Oak Hill Fire Rescue, and Linville Central Rescue. A total of 17 personnel participated in the rescue operation.\nThe hiker, who sustained a lower extremity injury, received immediate medical attention on-site. Rescue teams carefully assisted the individual along the trail back to the Conley Cove Trailhead, navigating challenging terrain over a six-hour operation. The patient was then transported to a nearby hospital for further medical evaluation and care.\nLinville Central offers the following suggestions for safely hiking and recreating in the area:\n- Call or text 911 if you are lost, sustained traumatic injuries from a fall, or experiencing a medical emergency.\n- If you find your way out or your situation changes, call 911 again to update rescuers.\n- Hike with at least one other companion.\n- Always tell someone your intended travel plans and return time.\n- Pack extra food and plenty of water.\n- Assume the weather will change — bring sun protection, rain gear, and extra layers for sudden cold.\n- Bring a cell phone charging battery pack.\n- Bring multiple headlamps in case your activity takes longer than planned.\n- Make sure everyone is wearing appropriate footwear for traction and to help avoid ankle injuries.\n- Collect all your trash. Leave a trail more pristine than you found it.\nIn June, the Linville-Central Mountain Rescue Team has been a part of the ground-base team assisting with four helicopter hoist rescues of injured hikersin the area.",

    "title": "Segovia, capital con mayor subida del país en alquiler al dispararse un 24,6%",
    "text": "Segovia es la capital española con mayor subida del alquiler en toda España, ya que el precio se ha incrementado un 24,6%, un aumento que ha llamado la atención a la empresa Idealista, autora del informe de precios del mes de diciembre de 2023, ya que la ciudad del acueducto deja atrás a grandes capitales del país en la revalorización de los pisos en renta.\nDe hecho, solo hay otras dos capitales en España donde se han encarecido por encima del 20%: Valencia (21%) y Palma (20,2%). Les siguen las subidas de Alicante (16%), Málaga (14,5%), Córdoba (13,8%), Madrid (13,6%) y Barcelona (12,4%). La única bajada se ha registrado en Huelva, con una reducción en las expectativas de los propietarios del 0,5%.\nEn el conjunto de Castilla y León el precio de la vivienda en alquiler también ha experimentado un incremento del 8,5% durante el último año hasta alcanzar los 7,7 euros mensuales por metro cuadrado, lo que supone el máximo histórico del alquiler en la región.\nTodas las provincias castellanas y leonesas registran precios superiores a los que tenían hace un año. La mayor subida se ha producido en Segovia donde las rentas han crecido un 21,8%, seguida por la subida de Zamora (10,1%), Ávila (8,3%), León (7%) y Palencia (6,9%). También subieron, aunque en menor medida, las expectativas de los propietarios en las provincias de Valladolid (6,3%), Salamanca (6,1%), Burgos (5,6%) y Soria (4,9%).\nGrandes municipios\nEn las capitales y municipios de más de 20.000 habitantes de la Comunidad, además del citado caso de Segovia, donde suben los precios un 24,6%, los mayores aumentos se han registrado en Ávila y Zamora (12,3%), seguidos de Burgos (8,3%), Palencia (7%), Arroyo de la Encomienda (6,9%), Miranda de Ebro (6,8%), Valladolid (6,75), Salamanca (6%), León y Ponferrada (4,3%), Soria (1,9%) y Aranda de Duero (0,5%). El informe de Idealista no ofrece datos de Laguna de Duero, San Andrés del Rabanedo y Medina del Campo.\nCon esta revalorización, las capitales y grandes municipios anuncian precios que llegan a su techo histórico en todos los casos. Segovia ofrece pisos en alquiler a 10,4 euros el metro cuadrado, seguida de Salamanca (8,7), Burgos (8,4), Valladolid (7,9), Miranda de Ebro (7,5), Arroyo de la Encomienda y Soria (7,6), León (7,3), Ávila y Palencia (6,9), Aranda de Duero (6,6) y Ponferrada (5,5).\nEl portavoz de Idealista, Francisco Iñareta, señaló, sin ambages, que 2023 ha sido un «mal año» para las personas que han buscado una casa de alquiler. «La oferta sigue evaporándose sin visos de que en 2024 vaya a aumentar y los precios marcan sus máximos históricos este mes de diciembre en la mayoría de mercados», manifestó.\n«Las constantes medidas regulatorias en materia de alquiler y su culminación con la aprobación de la ley de vivienda en mayo pasado provocaron el cataclismo actual: la desaparición del inversor en vivienda de alquiler y una retirada significativa de propietarios que han decidido no continuar alquilando sus casas a la vista de la inestabilidad regulatoria y de ser considerados el problema, cuando son la parte más importante de la solución», indicó el representante del portal inmobiliario.\nPor ello, auguró, «muchos de los propietarios que aún permanecen en el mercado están optando por el alquiler de temporada como vía para mantener sus inmuebles en el alquiler, endureciendo las condiciones y buscando inquilinos fiables».\n«Máximos históricos»\nAsegura Iñareta que, tras cinco años de «experimentos regulatorios», en los que se han aplicado políticas que «nunca han funcionado donde se aplicaron», la realidad «se ha impuesto», a su juicio. «Las medidas adoptadas para reducir precios y proteger a las familias más vulnerables han provocado justo lo contrario: la oferta es más reducida que nunca, los precios están en máximos históricos y los inquilinos más vulnerables han quedado completamente desprotegidos», precisó.\nA su juicio 2024 debería aprovecharse desde los poderes públicos «para recuperar la cordura, el sentido común y el diálogo. Actualmente, se hace especialmente necesario atender y escuchar a todos los actores y expertos del sector. Sin un giro de 180 grados en materia de alquiler, dentro de un año estaremos en una situación aún peor, mucho más lejos de un mercado estable, con mucha oferta y precios razonables».\nDurante 2023 se han revelado las consecuencias de las políticas de vivienda de los últimos tiempos: una reducción drástica de la oferta disponible y un aumento de los precios y tensión de las familias. En este año el precio ha crecido un 10,1% en España, hasta situarse en 12,1 euros mensuales.\nEn la ciudad de Barcelona los precios se han incrementado un 12,4% desde el mes de diciembre de 2022. El metro cuadrado se ha situado en 20,5 euros/m2, en lo que es el nivel más alto alcanzado por la ciudad. Solo en el último trimestre, los precios se incrementaron un 2,7% en la ciudad.\nMadrid finaliza el año con una subida interanual en el precio del alquiler de vivienda del 13,6%, lo que sitúa el precio del metro cuadrado en la capital en 17,9 euros. Otro ejemplo: el precio del alquiler subió un 21% en Valencia durante los últimos 12 meses. Este incremento ha dejado el precio del metro cuadrado en 13,3 euros, el nuevo máximo histórico de la ciudad.
