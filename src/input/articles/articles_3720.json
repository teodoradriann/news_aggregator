    "text": "For anyone working a minimum wage job in this new year, they will be paid more in 22 states and in at least 40 cities and counties across the country than they were in 2023. The higher hourly rates are due either to scheduled increases or lawmakers having indexed the minimum wage in their jurisdiction to inflation, most typically using the Consumer Price Index as their gauge. As of January 1, seven states and the District of Columbia will have minimum wages of $15 or more, up from just four states plus DC last year. The newcomers to the category are Maryland, New Jersey and most of New York State (with the exception of New York City, Westchester and Long Island, which already had a $15 minimum in place and where the minimum wage is increasing to $16 in 2024). The highest state minimum wage in 2024 will be Washington state, at $16.28, up from $15.74. A close second is California, which is raising its minimum to $16 from $15.50 on January 1. The state with the biggest jump in its minimum wage this year will be Hawaii, which is hiking it by $2. January 1 isn’t the only day minimum wages will go up. Some states, such as Nevada and Oregon, have increases set for July 1. Florida’s minimum will go up on September 30. RELATED: [Some businesses required to file new paperwork starting Jan. 1, 2024, or face fines](https://www.abc15.com/news/national/some-businesses-required-to-file-new-paperwork-starting-jan-1-2024-or-face-fines) (See the full list of states increasing their minimum wages below.) Cities, counties and some industries often trump state minimums States’ minimum wage rates are often eclipsed by those in many of their own cities and counties. Take the city of Tukwila, Washington, just south of Seattle. Its minimum wage will hit $20.29 in January, up from $18.99 now. At that level it will have the highest standard minimum wage rate in the country among states, counties and cities as of January 1, said Jana Bjorklund, senior counsel and director of employment law and compliance at GovDocs, a compliance software provider for large, multi-jurisdiction employers. Seattle, which with a rate of $19.97, won’t be far behind. At least 40 cities and counties also are hiking their minimum wages, according to GovDocs. They include Flagstaff, Arizona (to $17.40); Mountain View, California (to $18.85); Denver, Colorado (to $18.29) and Portland, Maine (to $15). And in some states, there are big sector-specific wage hikes on tap. In California, for instance, starting in April, fast food workers must be paid at least $20 an hour, and on June 1, health care workers will start earning between $18 and $23 an hour depending on their role and the size and type of employer they work for — an hourly rate that will eventually reach $25. In New York City, app-based restaurant delivery workers (e.g., those working for Uber, Grubhub and DoorDash) now must be paid a minimum hourly rate of $17.96, which is set to increase to $19.96 by 2025. The push for non-poverty wages The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. And 20 states — including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Alabama and Mississippi — still adhere to it. The push to raise it has gone on for years because minimum wage workers stuck at $7.25 have lost substantial buying power. Had it just been adjusted for inflation since 2009, it would be $10.33 today. But advocates for a higher minimum wage, including Holly Sklar, CEO of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, would rather see it adjusted for inflation from where it was in 1968. The wage then was $1.60, which in today’s dollars would be $14.39. That $1.60 provided minimum wage workers with their greatest purchasing power, Sklar said. “Every minimum wage increase since 1968 has been too little too late. … Full-time jobs used to keep people out of poverty.” She points to MIT’s living wage calculator to assess what a single person without kids would have to earn per hour just to cover the cost of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, transportation and medical care). For example, in Mississippi, where the minimum wage is just $7.25, a person would have to earn $15.30 an hour in Pike County just to pay for basic needs. But among child care workers, fast food cooks and cashiers in the state, the median wage (meaning half of people in those jobs earn less) ranges between $9.83 and $10.17 an hour, Sklar noted. Given how little movement there has been at the federal level to raise the country’s minimum wage sufficiently, she expects states and local jurisdictions will continue to do the heavy lifting. And she believes the economic case for their increases is there for both workers and employers. For workers, of course, “It eases the burden,” Sklar said. “People replace tires they couldn’t replace or get their kids clothes.” For businesses, she said, consumer spending goes up because minimum wage workers will spend their additional earnings quickly. And among other things, it will help boost retention of one’s workers because they won’t be as quick to quit for another 25 cents an hour. Less turnover, in turn, can reduce an employer’s hiring and training costs, among other benefits. “It’s a virtuous cycle,” Sklar said. State minimum wage increases in 2024* Alaska: $11.73, up from $10.85 Arizona: $14.35, up from $13.85 California: $16, up from $15.50 Colorado: $14.42 (proposed), up from $13.65 Connecticut: $15.69, up from $15 Delaware: $13.25, up from $11.75 Florida: $13, up from $12, on September 30 Hawaii: $14, up from $12 Ilinois: $14, up from $13 Maine: $14.15, up from $13.80 Maryland: $15, up from $13.25 for large employers and $12.80 for small employers Michigan: $10.33, up from $10.10 Minnesota: $10.85 for large employers, up from $10.59; $8.85, up from $8.63 for others Missouri: $12.30, up from $12 Montana: $10.30, up from $9.95 Nebraska: $12, up from $10.50 Nevada: $12, up from a $10.25 or $11.25 (depending on health benefits) – effective July 1, 2024 New Jersey: $15.13, up from $14.13 New York: $15, up from $14.20 (except in New York City, Westchester and Long Island, where it is set at $16, up from $15) Ohio: $10.45, up from $10.10 Oregon: Its $14.20 minimum wage will adjust for inflation on July 1 Rhode Island: $14, up from $13 South Dakota: $11.20 Vermont: $13.67, up from $13.18 Washington: $16.28, up from $15.74 District of Columbia: Its $17 minimum wage will adjust for inflation on July 1 *Unless otherwise noted, changes take effect January 1",

    "text": "Fuertes lluvias en Bogotá dejaron viviendas afectadas y colapsos en movilidad Durante la tarde de este jueves se presentaron fuertes granizadas en varios sectores de Bogotá, tras la intensa ola de calor de los últimos meses. Los meses de intenso calor en Bogotá parecen haber acabado. En la tarde de este jueves 21 de marzo se registraron, en varias zonas de la capital, fuertes aguaceros y granizadas que dejaron afectaciones en la movilidad y en algunas viviendas. De acuerdo con el Sistema de Alerta de Bogotá (SAB), varias estaciones de la red meteorológica presentaron lluvias en amplios sectores de la capital, lo que generó colapsos en la movilidad, por empozamientos y encharcamientos en las vías. Por su parte, entidades distritales encargadas de la Gestión de Riesgos entregaron un balance de por lo menos 10 viviendas afectadas tras un vendaval en el barrio El Mirador, en la localidad de Usme. Afortunadamente, no hubo personas lesionadas.

Allí, la situación fue atendida por el cuerpo de Bomberos, la Secretaria de Integración Social y el Instituto Distrital de Gestión de Riesgos y Cambio Climático (Idiger), para llevar a cabo el registro de la población afectada y determinar las ayudas humanitarias necesarias. Por ahora, los cuerpos de agua de la ciudad continúan con monitoreo constante y no existe alerta alguna por aumentos inesperados que puedan generar desbordamientos. Según la red metrológica del Idiger, las localidades en donde más llovió fueorn San Cristóbal, Suba y Usme. Para esta noche también se esperan algunas lloviznas en amplios sectores de la ciudad y cielo mayormente nublado. Daños por lluvias en Bogotá Videos tomados por la ciudadanía registraron algunos de los daños causados por las fuertes lluvias de este jueves en Bogotá. La mayoría de ellos en la localidad de Usme. Allí, un colegio y varias casas resultaron afectados, principalmente en las estructuras de los techos de teja debido a los vientos. En la institución educativa se reportaron preliminarmente cuatro estudiantes con heridas leves. En el municipio de La Calera, cerca de Bogotá, también hubo una intensa granizada, al igual que en zonas del centro de Boyacá, en donde la sequía había afectado los bosques.

At this stage, this court under the facts and circumstances of the case is not inclined to pass any direction. Accordingly, the plea is dismissed. [ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 23-02-2024 21:28 IST | Created: 23-02-2024 21:11 IST - Country: - India The Delhi High Court on Friday rejected the application seeking permission to offer prayer on Shab E Barat at the site of Akhunji Mosque in Mehrauli. The said 600-year-old Mosque was demolished by the DDA on January 30 and the site is in the possession of the DDA. Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav dismissed the plea after hearing the submissions of the parties. The High Court noted that urgency for passing an appropriate order on the instant application is expressed on the ground mentioned in the instant application which primarily, states that an unhindered entry be allowed in the graveyard and site of the Mosque i.e., Masjid Akhunji, of persons wanting to offer night-long prayers and visit at graves, site of departed elders beginning from thirty minutes before sunset on Sunday, on February 25, 2024 and ending thirty minutes after sunrise on Monday, February 26. The High Court said that the petitioner ought to have promptly approached this Court seeking relief to offer prayers on the occasion of the festival, the date of which was already known to all concerned. \"Rather, the petitioner has preferred to apply at such a belated stage, pressing for its urgent disposal without giving an opportunity to file aformal reply,\" the High Court observed. The application was moved by the Management Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board. Permission was sought for locals to enter the site for 30 Minutes on Sunday evening and Monday morning. The petition against the demolition is pending before the High Court and listed on March 7, 2024. The High Court said that admittedly the site in question is in possession of DDA and the High Court is seized of the matter which is listed on March 7. At this stage, this court under the facts and circumstances of the case is not inclined to pass any direction. Accordingly, the plea is dismissed. During the hearing, it was submitted that the mosque was built during the Delhi Sultanate Period 600-700 years ago. Advocate Shams Khwaja appeared for the Management Committee and argued that the people are celebrating Shab E Barat at the site of generations. It was also submitted by the counsel that on Shab E Barat people pay respect to their ancestors who had been buried at the graveyard which had been razed. The Delhi High Court on February 5, directed a status quo on the site after the action by the DDA.

    "text": "November 14, 2024 in News 507 SHARES 1.4k VIEWS Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Users appear to be making yet another exodus from the Elon Musk-owned social media platform , with rocketing to the top of app download rankings and courting millions of new users in the week since the US election.\nWhether users are permanently leaving X (formerly Twitter) or simply establishing new accounts elsewhere is unclear.\nBut brands and individuals alike are citing Musk’s in the US election as well as the polarizing nature of the X platform as the reason for their departures.\nBluesky — originally a Twitter project that was spun off into its own company reported more than 1 million new users in the last week. It now has 15 million in total.\nWhile it’s a minnow in the social media field, the platform has shot to top spot in Apple’s App Store rankings this week, just ahead of Instagram’s own X competitor Threads.\nThis is not the first time X has seen a decline in active users. Downturns notably happened after Musk took ownership of Twitter and when\nBut it looks as though Musk’s support for Trump has proven the final straw for certain account holders.\n“This is kind of a tipping moment to some extent,” Bart Cammaerts, a communications and democracy researcher at London School of Economics, told DW.\nCammaerts points to the whittling down of moderation and the ramping up of Musk’s own rhetoric around X’s future direction as long simmering developments that may have helped to push users away.\n“I think the fact that we see now so many people making that move is a combination of approaches that have been ongoing for longer than [the election].”\nWho’s leaving X? On Wednesday, The Guardian newspaper , though would not delete its accounts.\nIt is not alone in departing or downsizing its X presence. American media companies NPR and PBS stopped posting on the platform last year. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation also downsized its dozens of X offerings to just four: news, sport, Chinese language and “masterbrand” profiles.\nMore notable have been celebrity exits. US actors Jamie Lee Curtis and Bette Midler have both deleted their X accounts while retaining presences elsewhere. They join previous X-iters like Elton John, Jim Carrey, Whoopi Goldberg and Gigi Hadid who left or stopped posting after Musk’s takeover in 2022.\nOther public figures have vocalized their intent to leave X but have yet to delete their profiles. They include prominent media and political names like former CNN news anchor turned YouTube streamer Don Lemon and Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\nThere’s clearly a left-lean to the most vocal personalities to depart the platform.\nBut brands are leaving too — and from beyond the anglosphere. The Berlin Film Festival and Bundesliga team FC St Pauli are German brands that have announced their exit. Earlier in 2024, more than 50 other not-for-profits announced their departure via the campaign website byebyeelon.de.\nLast year, citing a rise in hateful content, drawing a public rebuke from Musk.\nWhy are they leaving? Among the reasons cited for departing the platform is the continued increase in negative content on the platform.\nThat includes the increase of toxic content, remarked by The Guardian in its published statement as “the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism.”\nBut it might be difficult to pinpoint a single cause for the exit. The newspaper noted its decision had been a long time coming and that it resources could be “better used” elsewhere.\n“News companies do not have unlimited resources, audiences do not have unlimited attention, so they might have to make a strategic decision if there is a platform that is associated to a high level of uncertainty when it comes to how the conversations will evolve in the short term,” Silvia Majo-Vazquez, a political communication researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, told DW.\n“They want to convert the audiences on social media platforms, [so] which audiences are you targeting right now on Twitter [X] with the drop of, also, [X] users?”\n“Other platforms are gaining traction, so probably they’ll mobilize their resources to those platforms which provide new [groups] that are more difficult to reach — young audiences — and perhaps provide better environments.”\nFor individuals, many are remarking the “feel” of other microblogging outlets is like a Twitter of old, with fewer bots and more one-to-one interactions.\n“If those functionalities can be offered by alternatives and enough people make that switch, it could go quite quickly. We’ve seen that also in the past with other platforms like Myspace, for example,” said Cammaerts.\nPolitics — and personalities — may keep migrating, discourse may minimize As much as celebrities, politicians and brands may turn their gaze to new social pastures, upstart platforms are still vulnerable to the same negative interactions and toxic content prevalent on established social media.\n“In a way people are going to the lesser of two evils because all these platforms have a business model that in essence is geared towards extraction, towards commodifying your sociality in ways contravening your privacy,” said Cammaerts.\n“So, sure, X is the worst and is problematic for a number of political reasons, but it doesn’t mean that these other platforms are necessarily ‘the good’.”\nThe future direction of public discourse online is difficult to predict, but he believes it is a conversation that needs to start now.\n“What do we want our democratic media environment to be? How do we want it to look? And can we, through democratic means, regulate it in such a way that it reaches that [democratic] ideal more than it does today? That can also be a contentious debate.”\nIt also assumes users will continue seeking “full view” public spaces to engage socially with each other.\nMajo-Vazquez predicts the rise of closed groups on private messaging apps will continue to grow, pushing online interactions further away from the global public square Twitter originally aspired to.\n“When it comes to social media platforms, the environment is getting more fragmented,” she said.\n“The attention that those major platforms were receiving … has been fragmented to many other places. Which winner will come out of this process, we don’t know.”\nThe post Another X-odus is underway as users grow on other social media platforms appeared first on Deutsche Welle .\nShare 203 Tweet 127 Share Trending Posts India’s capital introduces stricter anti-pollution measures as toxic smog hides Taj Mahal November 14, 2024",

    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — A celebrity author is brightening the holiday season for several Minnesota booksellers. James Patterson has given $500 prizes to 18 independent bookstores and employees across the state. Eight of the winners are in the Twin Cities, including Moon Palace Books in Minneapolis. \"Every year [Patterson] gives out money to booksellers around the country,\" said Angela Schwesnedl, the owner of Moon Palace Books. \"It's very exciting. I wish I knew who put my name in.\" Kenya Goldstein, an employee at Cherry Street Books in Alexandria, became the store's fourth bookseller to get the recognition. \"They're not just there to sell,\" said Emily Regnier, the owner of Cherry Street Books. \"They want to give you a book they know you're going to enjoy, and they like to learn what you're into, so when you come in time and time again, you sometimes will form a bond with a different bookseller.\" Schwesnedl and Regnier are quick to point out how well the industry is doing right now. They say there are more stores being opened and more books being published. \"There's a whole generation of kids who are growing up in this neighborhood with a neighborhood bookstore that they can go to,\" said Schwesnedl. \"Coming to the bookstore once a week on a Saturday or after school is a totally normal, totally fun thing to do.\" 17 bookstores in Wisconsin also received the bonus money. Patterson's Holiday Bookstore Bonus program gave away $300,000 to independent bookstores nationwide. To see all the booksellers who received the prize, click here .",
