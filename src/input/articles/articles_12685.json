    "text": "Five-star wide receiver Tristen Keys, ESPN's No. 16 overall prospect in the 2026 class, committed to LSU over Alabama, Tennessee and Texas A&M, his family told ESPN on Wednesday.\nThe pledge from Keys comes one day after ESPN's second-ranked wide receiver prospect visited the Tigers during a spring practice session and marks a significant recruiting win for LSU and coach Brian Kelly.\nKeys, who hails from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, is now the top-ranked member of the Tigers' 2026 class. If he signs with the program later this year, Keys will represent LSU's highest-rated wide receiver addition since the Tigers landed Kayshon Boutte as the No. 33 overall prospect in the 2020 cycle.\nThe commitment lands a cornerstone prospect within the program's latest recruiting class that includes six pledges from the ESPN Junior 300. Keys joins four-star in-state offensive tackle Brysten Martinez (No. 33) as the second top-100 player and four-star Kenny Darby (No. 276) as the second wide receiver committed to the program this cycle.\nKeys has been a priority for LSU and wide receivers coach Cortez Hankton. The 6-foot-3, 190-pounder caught 58 passes for 1,275 yards and 14 touchdowns in his junior season while helping Hattiesburg High School to the 6A state title game. He also participated in the Under Armour Next All-America game earlier this year.\nHe took unofficial trips to Auburn and Alabama in January and later scheduled a slate of spring visits this month with planned stops at Miami, Tennessee, Texas A&M and Michigan.\nThe coveted pass catcher made it to Miami and Tennessee in recent weeks before visiting LSU on Tuesday, a trip that ultimately solidified Keys' commitment as the first out of state pledge in the Tigers' 2026 class. It is not yet clear if Keys plans to follow through on upcoming trips to Texas A&M and Tennessee or his slate of official visits to Miami, Texas A&M, Tennessee and Alabama this spring.\nKeys' pledge marks a second consecutive cycle in which LSU has landed a commitment from one of the nation's top receivers. Five-star recruit Dakorien Moore, the No. 1 receiver in the 2025 cycle, spent nine months committed to the Tigers before he reopened his recruitment last spring and landed with Oregon later in the summer.",

    "text": "Country-based influenza pandemic preparedness is essential to prevent and prepare for the global spread of influenza viruses. Pandemics can lead to widespread illness, significant mortality, and substantial economic impacts due to healthcare expenses and loss of productivity. Through the concerted efforts of Member States, WHO, partners and investments from the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) Partnership Contribution (PC) and other sources, all 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR) now have a WHO-recognized national influenza centre (NIC). This significant accomplishment strengthens laboratory capacity in line with the objectives of the Global Influenza Strategy (2019-2030) .\nThe Global Influenza Strategy emphasizes the critical need to build strong national capacities, prioritizing laboratories to improve pandemic influenza preparedness and strengthen International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) core capacities. Given that NICs are the backbone of the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) , the region set and has now achieved its target to establish a WHO-recognized NIC in each SEAR Member State.\nBuilding a regional network\nIn 1952, India began building its influenza laboratory capacity, which coincided with the founding of GISRS. By the 1970s, WHO-recognized NICs were operational in India (1977), Indonesia (1976) and Thailand (1972). At the onset of the 2009 influenza pandemic, seven Member States (63%) had a NIC, with the NICs in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand supporting the four countries that did not have their own NIC.\nThe National Public Health Laboratory in Nepal was recognized by the WHO in 2010. In 2019, recognizing the critical role of NICs, the Regional Office aimed to designate and achieve WHO recognition for public health laboratories in the remaining three Member States (Bhutan, Maldives and Timor-Leste). WHO organized and coordinated external assessments of these public health laboratories, identifying key gaps in workforce competence, laboratory quality management, specimen transportation, documentation of laboratory activities and systematic equipment management.\nTo address these gaps, these three NICs worked closely with WHO, WHO Collaborating Centres at the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), and the Victoria Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Australia to train and mentor senior laboratory staff, thereby enhancing national capacities both in the short and long term. External financial support was provided through the PIP PC and other partners.\nThese collaborative efforts resulted in significant progress, as indicated by subsequent assessments, leading to WHO recognizing the remaining three laboratories as NICs.\nSustaining the gains\nAll SEAR Member States are now committed to maintaining high-quality and safe influenza testing. This is achieved through participation in the WHO External Quality Assessment Programme (EQAP), consistent data reporting to WHO, and the regular sharing of influenza viruses. WHO supports these efforts by conducting national and international surveillance reviews, coordinating regional biosafety trainings based on the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, and facilitating training and mentoring at WHO Collaborating Centres.\nIn 2023, a regional consultation brought together all NICs to discuss strategies for strengthening laboratory capacity to ensure the coordinated implementation of an expanded GISRS (e-GISRS) while preserving influenza-specific achievements. These strategies included adopting WHO-recommended standards for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza and engaging in broader consultations with countries. The aim was to define the scope and terms of reference for NICs, reference laboratories and other collaborators, ultimately improving the organization and coordinated implementation of e-GISRS within countries.\nThe concerted efforts of Member States, technical support from WHO and other partners, and sustainable financing through the PIP PC and other sources have significantly improved expertise and infrastructure at NICs. These enhancements have strengthened laboratory capacities for influenza preparedness in the WHO South-East Asia Region, aligning with the goals of the WHO Global Influenza Strategy.",

Sign up here to participate in the weekly emailed surveys.\nEarlier this week we asked fans how many games they think Michigan will win this weekend. The results are now in and fans are confident Michigan will win their first and second-round matchups in the NCAA Tournament and advance to the Sweet 16.\n80% of fans believe Michigan will have two wins this weekend, while 11% think it’ll be zero wins and 9% voting for one win.\nPer FanDuel Sportsbook, No. 5 seed Michigan (25-9) is a 2.5-point favorite over No. 12 seed UC San Diego (30-4) in their first-round matchup. If Michigan beats UCSD they’ll face either No. 4 Texas A&M (22-10) or No. 12 Yale (22-7) in the second round.\nHow did you vote this week?

As reported by Android Headlines, Google has canceled its development plans for the Pixel Tablet 3.\nAnother report from Android Authority suggests that the Google Pixel Tablet 2 has been canceled. So, does this mean Google is effectively killing the Pixel Tablet lineup? Let’s take a look at what this could mean for you.\nAlso Read Google made an AI tool to solve India’s AQI data problem: Details Say Goodbye to Pixel Tablets! The Google Pixel lineup had been quite popular, but the tablet seemed to not perform as well. Ongoing rumors suggest that Google has discontinued its Pixel tablet lineup. While it’s not yet clear for how long the Pixel tablet launch will stay stagnant, this marks a major shift for Google’s strategy.\nThis is not the first time Google has thought of killing its tablets. In 2019, it introduced the Pixel Slate, but things didn’t go as planned. Many users left negative reviews about the product, and in response to this, Google said it was done with making tablets. Fast forward four years, and in 2023, the tech giant introduced its Pixel Tablet, but it also failed to meet expectations, with many analysts and users calling it “the worst device.”\nTo conclude, this series of failures has forced Google to halt its Pixel tablet series. However, Google’s potential exit from the tablet category might only be temporary. Some reports suggest that Google is planning to migrate ChromeOS to Android, which could create a unified operating system where Google could focus all its development resources.\nThe Way Ahead Looking ahead, Google could bring a re-imagined AndroidOS with features from ChromeOS, making it more attuned to productivity tasks, while also great for entertainment purposes. Furthermore, a source from Google told Android Authority that the new plan is a ‘multi-year’ project.\nAlso Read OpenAI set to launch AI-powered web browser: Is Google’s dominance in Search at risk?

These measures are presented by the Department of Justice as part of a landmark case in Washington.\nFollow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook",
