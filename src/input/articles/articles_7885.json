Jr. Drive and Highland Avenue — just around the corner from Fiserv Forum — is preparing for the long basketball weekend with extra servers.\n\"It's going to be a really fun weekend. We have a lot of people coming in town,\" said Mader's banquet manager, Ben Stilp. \"This event is going to be expecting about 19,000 attendees. There is also a volleyball conference going over at Baird Center. It's going to bring in about 16,000 people, so a lot of people in the area.\"\nStilp said they're also opening their upstairs seating area, which increases the restaurant's capacity from 250 to 350 people.\n\"I think the most exciting part is all of the different people that we're going to be seeing. I mean, the teams are coming from all over the country. It's just a great opportunity to get the German culture out there for people and, of course, a lot of delicious German food.\"\nIf you buy a meal at Mader's, you can access its parking lot. You will have to show your receipt to the valet, and your parking will be covered for your session.",

    "text": "The Met Office has warned that temperatures could rise even further to 43C (109F) tomorrow – with trains already cancelled, hospital appointments cancelled and schools closed amid warnings that healthy people could die.\nIts chief executive Penny Endersby confirmed ‘we may well see the hottest day in the UK in history’ today – beating the record of 38.7C (101.7F) set in Cambridge in July 2019 – but tomorrow is now expected to be even hotter.\nWith the UK set to be hotter than the Sahara Desert today, transport links in London were already grinding to a halt due to train cancellations – while roads could melt and bosses have urged employees to work from home.\nHealth chiefs told patients to stay away unless it is an emergency amid fears hospitals will be overwhelmed, while emergency services urged swimmers to stay away from lakes and rivers in case they face difficulties.\nSome schools in Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire have shut while others will close early – and water providers have also warned of shortages after the hottest day of 2022 so far yesterday with 33C (91F) highs.\nOther schools were cancelling detentions and sports days because of the heatwave.\nNorthwood Community Primary School in Kirkby, Merseyside, said that sports day had been axed today; while King Charles I School, a secondary school in Worcestershire, has cancelled all on-site detentions both today and tomorrow.\nProfessor Endersby told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning: ‘We think today we may well see the hottest day in the UK in history, with the hottest temperatures in the South East, but actually the highest temperatures we expect tomorrow, and those temperatures will be further north as that warm air pushes north.\n‘It’s tomorrow that we’re really seeing the higher chance of 40C and temperatures above that.\nEven possibly above that… 41C isn’t off the cards. We’ve even got some 43Cs in the model but we’re hoping it won’t be as high as that.’\nOne GP surgery in Hertfordshire had to close a site today because it has no air conditioning; others in London have texted patients to warn them of reduced services with limited clinic rooms in operation; and Milton Keynes University Hospital said it was ‘standing down routine outpatient appointments and surgery’ today and tomorrow.\nIn Cardiff, a children’s hospital’s cancer ward at Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital was left without air conditioning after the unit failed in hot weather.\nEngineers were working to fix the fault affecting the chemotherapy area – and health chiefs said that if the problem cannot be solved, patients will be moved to a different ward to keep cool.\nAs health officials declared a ‘national emergency’, rail chaos was already affecting parts of London this morning – with the Overground suspended between Willesden Junction and Richmond, and Romford and Upminster.\nOn the Underground, the District, Central, Bakerloo and Jubilee lines all had severe delays while the Hammersmith & City Line was completely axed due to ‘heat related restrictions’ and there was no Metropolitan line between Baker Street and Aldgate.\nTransport for London told all passengers in the capital to avoid non-essential travel.\nThe scorching heat means the UK will be warmer than Nassau in the Bahamas (32C), Kingston in Jamaica (33C), Malaga in Spain (28C), Athens in Greece (35C), Albufeira in Portugal (28C) and Dakhla in the Western Sahara (24C).\nTemperatures had already hit 31C (88F) at Southend-on-Sea in Essex by 10.30am today.\nAs Britons camped overnight at Bournemouth beach for the best spot today amid what forecasters called an ‘exceptional hot spell’:\nThe Met Office urged people to do ‘as little as possible’ to avoid dire health risks as the ‘red warning’ began; Rail passengers were urged to travel only if ‘necessary’ and gritters were sent out to stop roads melting; Wildfires swept through parched grassland after days of dry and roasting conditions in ‘tinderbox’ Britain; There is now a 90 per cent chance of the all-time UK temperature record being broken today or tomorrow; Water providers including Affinity, Anglian and South East reported supply issues due to the hot weather. Professor Endersby said today that such extreme temperatures are not expected beyond tomorrow, but that the Met Office will then be monitoring the possibility of drought in the coming months.\n‘Well, we certainly don’t see these very hot temperatures persisting past Tuesday, so we’re expecting a big drop in temperature, mercifully, overnight into Wednesday – down 10 or 12 degrees on what it has been the days before.\nPeople relax on Bournemouth beach in Dorset this morning as the heatwave continues\nTwo women sunbathe at Clapham Common in South West London today amid the extreme conditions\nCommuters cross London Bridge today as the Shard reflects the sun in the early morning heat\nA woman enjoys a dip in the sea off Bournemouth beach in Dorset this morning as people flock to the seaside\nPeople preparing to enter the water in Penzance, Cornwall, today\nCommuters on London Bridge feel the heat at 8.30am this morning amid the extreme weather conditions\nA woman uses a fan to cool herself down as commuters cross London Bridge today in extreme temperatures\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\nUkrainian cargo plane carrying weapons crashes in fireball explosion\nWatch video\nFuneral descends into vicious brawl between rival families in NYC\nWatch video\nSmoke seen from runway after two planes have mid-air collision\nWatch video\nBody cam shows cops stand back as gunman fired in Uvalde classroom\nWatch video\nVideo appears to show plane turning into fireball in the sky\nWatch video\nOfficers help kids escape out windows during Uvalde shooting\nWatch video\nVideo shows Ukrainian plane with ‘dangerous’ cargo crash\nWatch video\nAuthorities secure site of plane crash near the city of Kavala\nWatch video\nMelbourne TikTok star reflects on act of kindness in his viral video\nWatch video\nKristi Noem’s ad fuels speculation of 2024 White House bid\nWatch video\nUvalde probe: Same system failings may be ‘across state and country’\nWatch video\nWoman wakes up from 2-year coma after being attacked by brother\nDM.later(‘bundle’, function()\nDM.molFeCarousel.init(‘#p-44’, ‘channelCarousel’,\n“activeClass” : “wocc”,\n“pageCount” : “3.0”,\n“pageSize” : 1,\n“onPos”: 0,\n“updateStyleOnHover”: true\n);\n);\n‘We are still seeing hotter than average in our three-month outlook and also very dry, and our attention is turning, once we’re past these two days, to drought and when we might see any rain, and we’re not seeing any significant rain coming up.’\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Britain braces for the blowtorch: UK’s ‘hottest day ever’… Death toll from European heatwave hits more than 1,000:… Boris Johnson misses COBRA heatwave meeting to ‘host leaving… Heatwave grinds Britain to a halt: Rail bosses tell…\nShare this article Share She also said that the public should take Met Office heat warnings as seriously as those about other significant weather events such as snow or wind, as the extreme heat could cause thousands of excess deaths.\n<div class=\"art-ins mol-factbox news halfRHS\" data-version=\"2\" id=\"mol-a395de20-067d-11ed-bec6-691d0f85f96d\" website in meltdown: Rail bosses and TfL cancel trains ahead of 41C\nWhen you adored this information as well as you wish to receive more information concerning Enrollment started for In-Person Shadow Teacher 2022-2023 in Neptune City borough i implore you to check out the web-site.",

    "text": "Welcome to the future of finance with FormFree. Since 2007, FormFree has been a game-changer in the world of loans, guided by a powerful mission: to “democratize lending for all people without bias.” With tools like Passport Wallet, RIKI, and FFX, they’re transforming lending in a game-changing way for those seeking loans but who have previously been unserved by the lending industry. Need a loan but worried about impacting your credit score? Passport Wallet uses your banking history to reveal your true borrowing power, while RIKI looks beyond traditional credit scores, considering factors like rent payments. And with FFX, you’re connected directly to lenders who get you. It’s not just lending; it’s lending with a heart and a new perspective. Credit Scoring: Unfair Game or Level Playing Field? Ever wondered if traditional credit scoring is [biased against you](https://medium.com/commonfuture/why-credit-scores-are-racist-da109fcfb300)? You’re not alone. Picture this: 26 million Americans are like ghosts in the credit world – totally “credit invisible.” But here’s the twist – it’s not a level playing field. [Reports](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/from-inherent-racial-bias-to-incorrect-data-the-problems-with-current-credit-scoring-models/) suggest that Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities are more likely to be credit invisible. Think about it – more than 20% of Black consumers and around 11% of Hispanic consumers are under the 620 credit score mark, while only about 5% of white consumers are in the same boat. The real issue? Old-school credit scores are missing pieces of the puzzle. They often overlook everyday bills like rent and cell phone payments. That’s where FormFree steps in. Only one in four Americans thinks their credit score is an accurate reflection of their financial status, new research suggests. And get this – many don’t even know their score or how to check it. FormFree’s solution? To rewrite the rules of the game, focusing on financial education and innovation to bridge these gaps and champion financial fairness. Passport Wallet: Your Ticket to a Fair Chance Step into the future of fair credit with Passport Wallet, where you aren’t seen as just a credit score but the whole of your financial journey. In a time where credit scores can be a stumbling block for many, especially in Black and Hispanic communities, Passport Wallet offers a game-changing move. It lets you mask your personal details while showcasing your real Ability To Pay. Think rental history, utility bills, and your bank story, not just those old-school credit scores. Passport Wallet is all about leveling the playing field. It’s like having a financial invisibility cloak that guards against bias, making loans for cars, homes, and dreams more reachable for everyone. Launched in January 2024, you can be one of the pioneers in this financial revolution, where fairness and equality are the new normal in credit assessment. Meet RIKI: Redefining Credit Scoring Enter RIKI, FormFree’s latest innovation that’s flipping the script on credit assessment. Imagine a world where 26 million Americans, currently invisible in the traditional credit system, get a fair chance. RIKI, short for “Residual Income Knowledge Index,” is here to make that a reality. With RIKI, it’s all about owning your financial narrative. Think beyond the usual [credit scores](https://gritdaily.com/mark-hauser-discusses-proven-strategies-for-improving-consumer-credit-scores/) – RIKI values your rent payments, cash flow, and residual income, painting a fuller picture of your financial health. RIKI isn’t just about loans; it’s about bridging the wealth gap and opening doors to opportunities that were once closed. It’s a leap towards a more inclusive financial future where your ability to pay is the star of the show. Introducing FFX FormFree’s FFX is revolutionizing lending by focusing on your financial strengths, not personal details. This new platform, [FFX](https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-launches-new-exchange-that-matches-qualified-borrowers-with-lenders/), is where lenders and financially ready borrowers connect directly. Think of it as a marketplace where your financial readiness is your ticket to better loan opportunities. FFX is all about transparent and efficient lending for homes, cars, and more. It’s not just a loan service; it’s about reshaping lending to be more accessible and profitable. By using FormFree’s Passport Wallet app, borrowers demonstrate their readiness, while lenders get the right info to make competitive offers. FFX is a smart solution in today’s financial landscape, addressing lender and borrower challenges by focusing on ready-to-transact borrowers, making lending simpler and fairer for everyone. Empowering Home Ownership through Collaboration: A Case Study FormFree works with partners like [Guild Mortgage](https://www.guildmortgage.com/nc-a/) to make it easier for people to own homes. They introduced RIKI in Guild Mortgage’s “Complete Rate” program, which looks at more than just credit scores. It considers things like how regularly someone pays rent and their income, allowing more people to get lower interest rates and the chance to own a home. Guild Mortgage says that with FormFree’s help, they’re helping clients find new ways to buy homes, even without traditional credit scores. FormFree and AI FormFree is revolutionizing the mortgage lending world with smart, fair technology. They’re very careful about how they use [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2024/january/mba-newslink-wednesday-jan-10-2024/formfrees-martin-prescher-on-balancing-fairness-innovation-with-ai-in-mortgage-lending/) in their work. Martin Prescher, FormFree CTO, explains that there are two main types of AI: one that follows set rules (deterministic) and another that learns from patterns in data (predictive). Predictive AI can sometimes pick up biases from the data it learns from. FormFree focuses on using the rule-following deterministic AI. This way, they make sure their decisions are fair and clear, and they don’t accidentally favor some people over others. They’re really committed to making sure everyone has a fair chance at getting a loan, especially those who might be overlooked by traditional ways of deciding who gets a loan. Discover Your Borrowing Power with FormFree Established in 2007, FormFree stands at the forefront of housing finance, data analysis, and financial technology. Boasting an impressive collective experience of over 220 years, FormFree is dedicated to making credit access more democratic and creating a financial landscape that includes everyone.

    "text": "The boy with big dreams has, step by step, season by season, become the man capable of striding into the semi-finals of the US Open without dropping a set.\nJack Draper - an \"absolute tennis keeno\", in the words of former British number one Laura Robson - was not blessed with height as a boy.\nBut a timely growth spurt in his late teens took him to 6ft 4in and, now his body has got used to the idea, the 22-year-old is starting to look highly dangerous.\nCapable of making short work of service games and dominating from the baseline, Draper has also been thinking carefully about two things central to many of our daily lives: smartphones and caffeine.\nDraper played two practice sets with Cameron Norrie before Queen's back in 2022. Draper won the first set but went down an early break in the second. Norrie suggested Draper's concentration may have been affected by checking his phone at the change of ends.\nDraper vowed to leave his phone switched off in practice in future - and, after a discussion with coach James Trotman, has recently decided to cut out caffeine.\n\"I used to take a lot of caffeine before I played, because I felt maybe sometimes with my emotions, I would feel tired before I played,\" Draper told BBC Sport after his quarter-final victory over Alex de Minaur.\n\"The anxiety would shut me down, so my way of dealing with it was taking on a hell of a lot of caffeine.\n\"But I learnt that probably wasn’t the best situation because I ended up becoming very wired and very agitated, and I wasn’t able to be present and focus on what’s important.\n\"I think it was probably best that I cut it out of my life.\"\nFrom hothead to warrior - Draper's journey to US Open semis\nPublished 5 September How Britain's Draper became US Open semi-finalist\nPublished 5 September I have another 'level' for semi-final - Draper\nPublished 5 September A settled team often leads to a happy and productive player, and Trotman has been with Draper for three years. He also has his older brother, Ben, acting as his agent.\nBen played college tennis at both the University of California in Berkeley and Wake Forest, and can brag about a perfect record against his younger brother.\nIn their only meeting - at the Nike Junior International at Queenswood School near London in July 2015 - Ben won 6-1 6-4 against a 13-year-old Jack. The match should have been played on a clay court, but was brought inside because of the weather.\nMr and Mrs Draper also have deep connections to the sport.\nMother Nicky was an outstanding junior player and later became a coach, while dad Roger spent seven years running the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\nNicky remembers her son hitting tennis balls against the garage wall with both his right and left hand aged just one.\nShe prefers to leave Draper's coaching to others these days, but did recently suggest a top-spin lob could win him a few more points.\n\"Lo and behold, the next match he played, he did that,\" she told Today on BBC Radio 4.\nDraper has also spoken movingly about the role of his grandparents, who took him and Ben to many tournaments in the UK and abroad when they were juniors.\nTheir 'nana' is now living with Alzheimer’s disease and can no longer understand the success her grandson is having. But grandad regularly watches his matches, and keeps a close eye on the live score apps and rankings.\nHe has told his grandson he wants to see him achieve everything he possibly can before his time runs out.\nImage source, Jack Draper Image caption, Jack Draper is a 'Sports Champion' for the Alzheimer's Society, which raises awareness of the condition\nOn court, Draper's core team comprises Trotman - whose clear and concise messages offering tactics and encouragement are picked up by the microphone in the players’ box - along with physio Will Herbert, who was with Emma Raducanu when she won the US Open in 2021, and fitness coach Steve Kotze, who has transformed a body all too prone to breaking down.\nUntil recently, former top-10 player Wayne Ferreira was also part of that coaching team. He helped him tap into a more aggressive mindset, but after four months, Draper decided he wanted to have just one voice in his ear.\n\"He's an amazing guy - his value as a coach, but also as a person, is huge,\" Draper said on the eve of the US Open.\n\"But I'm an over-thinker, I like to keep things simple as much as possible, and difficult decisions need to be made in high-level sport.\"\nTwo weeks on, Draper is into the semi-finals. He appeared on the front page of Thursday’s Wall Street Journal, under the caption \"Contenders Step Out of the Shadows at the US Open\".\nWhatever happens against Jannik Sinner on Friday, Draper will become a top-20 player for the first time - and, as he predicted two years ago, that is unlikely to be his peak.\n\"I was a really late developer. There are players who have developed really early, and they're ready to do it when they are 22 or 21,\" he said in 2022.\n\"But I think I'll be at my peak when I'm 25.\"\nRelated topics Tennis More on this story Live scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone\nPublished 6 June",

    "text": "More air defense systems and means of destruction of Russian aviation bring peace closer - address by the President of Ukraine\nPresident of Ukraine\n10 March 2024 - 22:08\nDear Ukrainians!\nA few important things for this day and these weeks.\nFirst of all, our defenders of the sky.\nI would like to recognize all Ukrainian warriors who defend our sky every day and night. Only this Sunday night they managed to shoot down 35 \"Shahed\" drones. In total, since the beginning of March, Russian terrorists have already used 175 such killer drones against Ukraine. Fortunately, 151 of them were shot down by our warriors. And this is a very important result. Yes, not all of them. Yes, there are hits. Unfortunately, there are losses. There are casualties. But there are also people saved.\nI am grateful to every warrior of our mobile firing groups in all regions of combat duty. I am grateful to every pilot and engineer of the Air Force, to all our air defense warriors. We will further enhance our firepower and Ukrainian air defense. More air defense systems and other means of destruction of Russian aviation bring peace closer. I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps us with this. Ukraine will have more air defense systems - we are working very hard on this.\nSecond. Our Defense Forces consist of many elements. Many brigades and units. And everyone who serves at the front, everyone who defends the state from Russian saboteurs and terror, everyone who performs combat missions deserves gratitude and respect. Russian murderers and torturers are not moving further into Europe only because they are being held back by Ukrainians with weapons in their hands and under the blue and yellow flag. In Ukraine, there were many once-white walls of houses and churches that are now scorched and ruined by Russian shells. And this speaks very eloquently about who has to stop for the war to end.\nAnyone who protects life and people fulfills the most honorable possible mission amid such an inhuman invasion. And we must fully protect life in our home. And I thank everyone who supports our defense, Ukrainian defenders.\nWhen the Russian evil started this war on February 24, all Ukrainians stood up for defense. Christians, Muslims, Jews - everyone. I thank every Ukrainian chaplain who is with the army, in the Defense Forces. They are on the frontline, protecting life and humanity, supporting with prayer, conversation, and deeds. This is what the church is - it is together with people, not two and a half thousand kilometers away somewhere, virtually mediating between someone who wants to live and someone who wants to destroy you. I thank everyone who is doing everything in Ukraine and with Ukraine to save lives, I thank everyone who is helping and who is really with us through actions and prayers.\nToday I would like to recognize the servicemen of our National Guard who are fighting alongside everyone else on the frontline in the east and south of Ukraine. The warriors of the 3rd operational brigade - Junior Sergeant Viktor Ivanov and Lieutenant Kyrylo Kudinov. The 5th Slobozhanska Brigade of the National Guard - soldiers Serhiy Turilkin and Mykola Hnatyuk. I would also like to recognize the warriors of the 1st and 3rd assault squads of the Omega Special Forces Center of the National Guard. Thank you for your skills and the results Ukraine needs.\nAlso, following these weeks, we have reasons for gratitude to the servicemen of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine - the details should not be disclosed publicly now, but the enemy definitely feels their work. And the more the Russian state loses, the sooner all this evil of war will disappear from our land.\nToday I spoke with French President Macron. The conversation lasted more than an hour. I am grateful to Emmanuel for his new initiatives in support of Ukraine, for his leadership, which gives all of us in Europe strength. I am grateful for the new defense package. We discussed the schedule and key expected results of our upcoming meeting in Ukraine.\nOne more thing. The holy month of Ramadan is now beginning for Muslims in Ukraine and around the world. And this year, unfortunately, Ramadan is overshadowed by ongoing war and suffering. May this month bring us all closer to a fair and just peace. Not only for Ukraine. But for all the nations that are suffering from war. Humanity is capable of achieving a level of unity where justice protects life from wars.\nI am grateful to everyone who helps Ukraine and Ukrainians! I am grateful to everyone who defends life and justice!\nRamadan Mubarak! Glory to Ukraine!\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

    "text": "( MENAFN - Khaleej Times) Published: Thu 4 Jul 2024, 6:33 PM\nLast updated: Thu 4 Jul 2024, 10:17 PM\nTwo male African Manatees – rare and vulnerable species – are having a ball at the National Aquarium in Abu Dhabi.\nFlown in on a special flight earlier this year, each of the manatees is fed about 20kg of hydroponically grown healthy veggies daily, gets personal attention from vets, trainers and staff, is monitored round-the-clock, and also growing in popularity among the visitors.\nThe National Aquarium, the first facility in the region to host the mammoth manatees, has gone the extra mile to provide the aquatic mammals with an environment mimicking their natural habitat in Africa.\nStay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.\nOffering an exclusive backstage tour, Lewis Cocks, the curator at the aquarium, told Khaleej Times about the royal treatment given to the manatees, and how the state-of-the-art facility has been playing a pivotal role in advancing conservation efforts for this vulnerable species.\n“We use hydroponics technique to grow fresh food vertically. The daily intake of a manatee is up to 8 per cent of its body weight, i.e., about 21kg,” Lewis said. The main course includes cabbage, lettuce, and bok choy. In desserts are sweet potato, low sugar fruits and pellets.\nThe African Manatees are one out of the three remaining species of manatees, the others being the West Indian and Amazonian – all are categorised as vulnerable. The manatees became endangered while facing threats including illegal hunting, entrapment caused by man-made structures, accidental capture in fishing nets, hits by boats, and habitat loss.\n“There has been less awareness of protection and conservation. But now they have got guardians,” Lewis pointed out.\nThe African Manatees are also among the least studied manatee species in the world, and now TNA is working closely with the African Aquatic Conservation Fund (AACF) NGO to safeguard this vulnerable species.\n“Even though the African fund has studied manatees in the wild, it hasn't got much chance to work with them closely. Also, they very rarely see manatees. Now, the African fund team will come here to study. They can learn how the manatees live and eat. It's a first-of-a-kind chance for them to study this species.”\nSignificantly, TNA in collaboration with the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (MBZSCF) has started groundwork in West Africa for the 'African Manatee Conservation Project'.\nLewis pointed out the funding woes faced by conservationist groups in Africa, and how TNA has committed an annual contribution of $25,000 to sustain the project. The money is sourced from proceeds generated by its Manatee retail shop at the aquarium. It will be used by AACF for research, conservation, and educational outreach initiatives to protect the population in their natural habitats in Senegal and Guinea.“We've set up this partnership and it's nice to get them a better life.”\nIn the past few months since their arrival, TNA experts have been able to learn new things about the mammals.\n“These two manatees are aged between 15 to 20 years old and can live up to 40 years. They both are opposite in their characters. While one is socially interactive, the other is shy.”\nThe manatees are in the large tank along with African Arowana and Giraffe Catfish. Often, the small fish species can be seen 'cleaning' the manatees.\n“We have been learning a lot about their food behaviour. The recent discovery is that even though other species are vegetarian, the African Manatees are omnivorous. They can take a bit of meat, small fish, catfish, and shellfish. We're learning a lot about how they breathe, and getting accustomed to their new environments. We are training them. There is a trainer who goes in to train them.”\nLewis noted that the friendly manatees are also intelligent.\n“They learn new things. We can make them wait, stop, eat certain things. They are quite intelligent, more than they seem to be.”\nALSO READ:\nUAE's first AI-enabled honey testing centre launched in Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi launches initiative to map noise levels\nMENAFN04072024000049011007ID1108408598",

    "text": "The Finnish Orthodox Church has encountered disagreements over a prayer for the anniversary of the war in Ukraine.\nThe prayer for the anniversary of the war has caused disagreements in the Finnish Orthodox Church\nThe prayer that was planned to be recited during services for the anniversary of the war in Ukraine has sparked disagreements in the Finnish Orthodox Church. It was approved by the head of the church, Archbishop Ilia, but faced opposition from Metropolitan Arsenii. This was reported by 'Hlavkom' citing Yle.\nThe charity organization Filantropia sent the text of the prayer to Orthodox churches in Finland via email. It includes a request for God's protection for 'the long-suffering Ukraine.'\nArchbishop Ilia encourages parishes to commemorate the anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine with the accompanying prayer or another appropriate service - either on Sunday, February 23, or on Monday (the actual anniversary of the start of the war),” the letter states.\nAt the same Time, Metropolitan Arsenii prohibited the reading of this prayer in his diocese - Kuopio and Karelia. He allowed a memorial service to be held, but without using the added prayer. In his letter to the clergy, Arsenii explained that holding a service could exacerbate disagreements among parishioners, among whom are both Ukrainians and Russians.\nHere a position is taken in favor of one side of the war. Among our parishioners, there are both Ukrainians and Russians. As the bishop of the diocese, I must maintain unity and not divide the community by taking one side,” said the metropolitan.\nIt should be noted that Helsingin Sanomat reported that Metropolitan Arsenii has already been involved in scandals. In particular, last November, his secretary was dismissed due to threatening behavior after he expressed support for Russian values.\nRead also",

    "text": "Undoubtedly, 2023 has been a busy year for NASA. It managed to take pieces from the Bennu Asteroid and bring them down to Earth. After the successful mission, the spacecraft set out to explore the metallic asteroid Psyche. Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes opened the mystery of cosmic objects. He shared the visual feast in the sky with the whole world. 2024 will bring more discoveries. Here are the details…\nNASA published a video explaining its goals for 2024!\n2023 has been an important year for the space world. Space studies progressed without slowing down. However, private space companies also gained importance. NASA published a video on its social media accounts about the goals it wants to achieve in 2024.\nNASA will set foot on the Moon’s surface after a long time. Undoubtedly, the most anticipated mission of 2024 will be 4 astronauts coming as close as 80 miles to the surface of the Moon. This mission will be the Artemis II flight, which will send it near the Moon. In the Artemis III flight, astronauts will land on the lunar surface. For this, the space agency will cooperate with the private space company SpaceX. SpaceX is developing the Starship Rocket for this mission. He recently performed 2 tests. However, Starship has not yet reached orbit.\nNASA plans to launch the Artemis Mission in November 2024. With this mission, the space agency will test the new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. In this mission, astronauts will follow the same path as the uncrewed Artemis I mission with the Orion spacecraft.\nWhile staying near the Moon, NASA will send VIPER (Volatiles Exploring the Polar Exploration Rover) to the lunar surface in 2024. The rover, about the size of a golf cart, will explore the moon’s South Pole for lunar water ice, a vital resource for the crew.\nAt the same time, lunar ice could be turned into fuel for rockets traveling from the lunar surface to planets further away. The VIPER mission was supposed to launch this year. However, NASA postponed the mission to conduct more tests on the spacecraft’s landing system.\nThe space agency will initiate studies to discover extraterrestrial life. For this, it will explore Europa, one of Jupiter’s largest moons. NASA plans to launch the Europa Clipper Mission in 2024.\nOver the next year, the James Webb Space Telescope will continue its groundbreaking deep space exploration. The new crews will arrive aboard the International Space Station to continue scientific work in microgravity conditions approximately 250 miles above Earth.",

    "text": "(Reuters) – U.S. drugmaker Amgen’s shares jumped 13% to $316.26 premarket on Friday as the company teased encouraging data for its experimental obesity drug, igniting investor hopes but leaving Wall Street frustrated over a lack of details.\nAmgen, which is conducting mid-stage studies of its injectable drug MariTide, said that it was “confident in MariTide’s differentiated profile and believe it will address important unmet medical needs.”\nThe company expects to have data from the Phase 2 trial late this year and said it is planning “for a comprehensive Phase 3 program across multiple indications,” including diabetes.\nInvestors late Thursday shrugged off a slight drop in the company’s first-quarter adjusted profit and slightly-lower-than expected sales of drugs including arthritis treatment Enbrel and psoriasis therapy Otezla.\n“Never Mind the Quarter – How ‘Bout That MariTide Update?,” Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond wrote in a research note, calling the quarter “sort of ho hum.”\nRaymond said the company’s comments about investing in manufacturing capacity for clinical and commercial supply were encouraging, but added “frustratingly, management provided little color as to exactly HOW this agent appears differentiated from currently approved GLP-1s.”\nBrokerage RBC cut its price target on Amgen’s stock by $4 to $332 after the results.\nMariTide, given by injection, joins a compound designed to activate the GLP-1 hormone associated with a feeling of fullness to an antibody that blocks activity of a different gut hormone, GIP, which has been linked to metabolic regulation.\nAmgen’s stock, part of the bluechip Dow Jones index, has risen 21% in the past 12 months but underperformed those of weight-loss market leaders Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which have risen about 75% and 54%, respectively.\nAmgen shares trade 13.9 times their forward 12-month earnings estimates, versus a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 34.2 for Novo Nordisk and 48.49 for Eli Lilly.\n(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonia Cheema)",
