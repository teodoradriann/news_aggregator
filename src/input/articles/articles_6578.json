    "text": "London: The UK government has sanctioned one million pounds towards a new World Wars Muslim Memorial to honour the sacrifice of Muslim soldiers who fought in the British armed forces in the two world wars, including Indian Muslims recruited to the British Indian Army during the colonial era. According to the World Wars Muslim Memorial Trust (WWMMT), a registered charity created to campaign for such a memorial, more than 750,000 Muslims served in the Indian and Allied armies during both world wars, of whom approximately 147,000 were killed. UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced the funding for the new memorial in his Spring Budget speech in the House of Commons this week. “Whatever your faith, colour or class, this country will never forget the sacrifices made for our future,” he told MPs. The memorial will be created in the National Memorial Arboretum at Staffordshire, in the West Midlands region of England. The arboretum is a 150-acre site on the edge of the National Forest which is dedicated to remembering those who served and sacrificed their lives for Britain. The new memorial will take its place alongside commemorative memorials on behalf of Sikhs, Gurkhas and others, providing an important place for reflection by communities who lost relatives, as well as a place for those who wish to learn more about Britain’s rich and diverse history, WWMMT said. “Our project coincides with the widespread re-evaluation of colonial history and the role Muslims play in a dynamic and changing modern Britain,” said Sir William Blackburne, chair of the Trust. “We want to emphasise shared sacrifices, a common history and values, and an inclusive programme of education for everyone in the UK Muslims and non-Muslims alike. The memorial will be a physical reminder of how people of all faiths make an impact working together and can continue to do so despite the challenges of those who attempt to divide our society,” he said. The memorial will take the shape of a minaret, which is an integral part of mosque architecture all over the world. A low exedra wall will be inscribed with stories of Muslim soldiers who fought in the name of the British crown. Materials for construction will be hard-wearing brick and terracotta sourced from different parts of the UK. Sajid Javid, a British Muslim Conservative member of Parliament who was credited for his campaign in its favour by Jeremy Hunt, said: “The service of British Muslim soldiers in the UK armed forces deserves recognition at the National Memorial Arboretum. “Thanks to this announcement by the Chancellor, and the excellent campaigning of the World Wars Muslim Memorial Trust, this vision will now become a reality. I am delighted to have supported the campaign, which will have an enduring legacy for years to come.”",

    "text": "XALAPA, VER.- A casi dos meses de que la tormenta tropical Nadine azotó el estado de Veracruz, principalmente a la región sur y dejó severas afectaciones en diferentes municipios, este jueves 12 de diciembre quedó reparado el puente Pozuelos que comunica al municipio de Tlalixcoyan con municipios aledaños de la región central costera de la entidad.\nLa Secretaría de Infraestructura, Comunicaciones y Transportes Veracruz, informó a través de sus cuentas oficiales que ya se concluyeron este jueves 12 de diciembre, los trabajos de rehabilitación del puente vehicular Pozuelos en Tlalixcoyan, ubicado en el kilómetro 15+550 de la carretera estatal Paso del Toro - Alvarado - Tlalixcoyan.\nTe podría interesar\nEste puente vehicular, que conecta a Tlalixcoyan con la localidad de Paso del Toro y los municipios de Medellín de Bravo, Alvarado, Boca del Río y el puerto de Veracruz, se vio afectado tras el paso de la tormenta tropical Nadine ocurrido a principios del mes de octubre del 2024.\nEsto debido a que las fuertes lluvias hicieron que las grietas que ya tenía el concreto, se fueran agrandando hasta que los bloques del material se movieran de su lugar, corriendo el riesgo de colapsar con el paso de vehículos particulares y de transporte púbico. Ante esto, el pasado 21 de octubre se informó el cierre de circulación total sobre esta vía de comunicación, en lo que autoridades estatales llevaban a cabo los trabajos de rehabilitación, mismos que terminaron a más de un mes del hecho.\nDurante 40 días, permaneció cerrado este tramo carretero y aunque se confirmó que este jueves 12 de diciembre concluyeron los trabajos de reparación, autoridades estatales informaron que la circulación vehicular quedará reabierta hasta el próximo lunes 16 de diciembre, debido a que es el tiempo estimado en el que se concluya el fraguado del concreto colocado, es decir, que termine el proceso de endurecimiento del cemento.\n[ÚNETE A NUESTRO CANAL DE WHATSAPP. EL PODER DE LA INFORMACIÓN EN LA PALMA DE TU MANO](http://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va5vqjjFXUuSaZbbly3G)\n¿Qué fue lo que se le hizo al puente Pozuelos de Tlalixcoyan?\nLa SICT Veracruz dio a conocer que se demolieron las dos losas superiores y el primer cabezal del puente Pozuelos, también, se colocó una plataforma de piedras (pedraplén) en la orilla del río para garantizar una superficie plana y estable.\nAdemás, se instalaron dos líneas de alcantarilla tipo cajón prefabricadas, sobre las cuales se formó el cuerpo del terraplén, reforzado con muros y aleros. Finalmente, se niveló la estructura, se pavimentó y se adecuó a la superficie de rodamiento del puente para asegurar su funcionalidad y seguridad.\nch",

    "text": "Ex-NBA Guard Patrick Beverley Makes Bold Victor Wembanyama Statement San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama took the NBA world by storm in his rookie season. Entering the league with incredible hype and expectations, Wembanyama turned in a historic rookie campaign. Winning Rookie of the Year and making first team All-Defensive, Wembanyama set the foundation for what should be an incredible NBA career. Getting better as the season went on, the Spurs star got more and more comfortable throughout his rookie year. Many feel it is just a matter of time before Wembanyama takes over the NBA, and with the Spurs adding veteran point guard Chris Paul, some believe that process may be expedited. While Paul is far from who he once was, the 12-time NBA All-Star should be able to elevate Wembanyamaâ€™s game. During a recent episode of his Pat Bev podcast, former Chicago Bulls guard Patrick Beverley claimed Wembanyama will be the NBAâ€™s best player next season. â€œHeâ€™s everything,â€� Beverley said of Wembanyama when asked if the 7-foot-4 star is a center. â€œYou canâ€™t even put him in comparison with other people. Heâ€™s the best player in the NBA next year.â€� This is a bold prediction from Beverley, but he is likely not alone in feeling this way. With a year of NBA experience under his belt and a new veteran point guard, Wembanyama could take off next season.

    "text": "DETROIT – It is April 2024 and many people are preparing to don their eclipse glasses for the highly anticipated solar eclipse [which is only a few days away](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2024/03/31/expert-breaks-down-what-you-need-to-know-about-april-8-solar-eclipse/). The rare celestial event brings people from all over together to experience the breathtaking sight of the obscured Sun. [The total solar eclipse on April 8](https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Total_Solar_Eclipse_2024/) will be passing through Ohio and Indiana with [a small portion of Michigan in the path of the eclipse](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2024/04/03/why-you-probably-shouldnt-go-to-this-michigan-city-to-watch-april-8-solar-eclipse/). With the next coast-to-coast solar eclipse not happening until 2045 and the next eclipse visible from Michigan not occurring until 2099, many have made are planning trips and RSVPing for eclipse-related events to take advantage of the nearly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a solar eclipse within driving distance of their home. In the midst of all of the excitement for the event, Local 4 Meteorologist Ashlee Baracy took an opportunity to speak with Dr. David Gerdes, [the Chair of Physics and Professor of Astronomy at the University of Michigan](https://websites.umich.edu/~gerdes/), about this year’s eclipse as well as what precautions should be taken to safely observe it. “Eclipses are a beautiful thing to watch and experience, and it’s important to keep in mind safety precautions when doing so,” said Professor Gerdes when asked about safely observing the solar eclipse, “It is never safe to look at the Sun without eye protection whether during an eclipse or not, so during the partial phases of the eclipse, you have to look at the Sun wearing a pair of special eclipse glasses which are like very dark sunglasses.” The special eclipse glasses provided for these events are essential for those wanting to observe the partial phases of the eclipse whether it is done with their own eyes or through the lens of a camera as attempting to observe the eclipse without proper protection can permanently damage your eyesight [or the lens of the camera you look through](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/04/why-a-solar-eclipse-could-ruin-your-phone-camera/). Regardless of where you purchase or obtain these glasses or lens filters from it is also important to know whether the filters meet safety standards for the eclipse or not. “If you can see your surroundings, they’re probably not good enough to be eclipse glasses,” Professor Gerdes advised. If you’re unable to obtain a pair of eclipse glasses or a filter for your camera, there are other ways to observe the partial phases of the eclipse. As Professor Gerdes mentions, there are ways to make homemade “pinhole projectors” that will project the eclipse onto a wall or floor. Kitchen colanders will also work as a sort of “projector” for the eclipse. Read: [Why you need special glasses to view a solar eclipse](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/03/why-you-need-special-glasses-to-view-a-solar-eclipse/) These methods of observation are absolutely necessary in order to safely enjoy the early and late phases of the solar eclipse, but for the few moments of totality, for those that are in the areas of 100% totality, observers may safely look directly at the Sun to take in the amazing, rare sight of the Sun’s corona. “The special thing about totality is that during those few minutes of the total eclipse when the moon is completely covering the sun you can take your glasses off you can look directly at the Sun, and you will see that beautiful solar corona that is there all the time but is not visible under ordinary conditions,” said Professor Gerdes. However, in Detroit, we will be getting a 99% partial eclipse, and though most of the sun will be eclipsed, it is still not advised to look at the partial eclipse without proper eye protection as Professor Gerdes advises, “1% of the Sun’s light is about 400 times brighter than the full Moon. It’s a lot of light, it will cast shadows, the sky will be blue, it is not safe to look at the Sun even when it’s 99% eclipsed.” Related: [Most of Michigan will see 99% of total solar eclipse. Is that enough?](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/04/most-of-michigan-will-see-99-of-total-solar-eclipse-is-that-enough/) Eclipse glasses are readily available at different retailers, they’ll be given out at several eclipse-related events and many libraries will be giving out glasses for the event in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. It is strongly recommended that those who wish to enjoy this rare event obtain a pair beforehand to safely observe the Sun during any social eclipse. For more information on where to get a pair of approved eclipse glasses, [we have an article detailing several events providing them here](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/04/where-to-buy-safe-solar-eclipse-glasses-in-michigan/).

Se prevén precipitaciones y tormentas, afectando especialmente el norte y suroeste, con posibilidades de formación de tormentas aisladas en otras áreas.\nLa madrugada del sábado 2 de noviembre marcará el ingreso de un sistema frontal que traerá consigo lluvias y tormentas, algunas de las cuales podrían ser intensas, comenzando en el suroeste y extendiéndose al resto del territorio nacional a medida que avanza el día.\nEn cuanto al domingo 3 de noviembre, se espera un breve alivio en las condiciones meteorológicas, aunque para el lunes 4 se pronostica una nueva desmejora que iniciará desde el litoral oeste, afectando posteriormente al resto del país. Esta inestabilidad podría prolongarse hasta la mañana del martes 5.\nEn las zonas donde se desarrollen tormentas, se podrían registrar rachas de vientos fuertes y muy fuertes, así como precipitaciones que podrían ser abundantes y, en algunos casos, copiosas. Además, existe la posibilidad de granizo y actividad eléctrica intensa.\nSe recomienda a la población estar atenta a los pronósticos oficiales que emita el Instituto Uruguayo de Meteorología (Inumet) a través de su página web y redes sociales.\nTendencias Climáticas: Octubre, noviembre y diciembre 2024\nEste informe de tendencias de carácter estacional se basa en el estado actual del clima y en las relaciones históricas entre el mismo y las condiciones de temperatura del mar en áreas remotas, respaldadas por modelos de predicción de centros internacionales de investigación.\nEn términos de acumulación de lluvias durante el trimestre de octubre a diciembre de 2024, el territorio se divide en dos regiones. La primera, que incluye gran parte del país, como el litoral oeste, el norte y el sur, experimentará precipitaciones por debajo de lo normal, distribuyéndose en un 45% al tercil inferior, 35% al tercil medio y 20% al superior.\nEn contraste, la segunda región, ubicada en el este, presentará precipitaciones dentro del rango normal, con un 40% en el tercil medio y un 30% en ambos extremos de la distribución.\nLas proyecciones indican que la temperatura media durante el mismo período estará por encima de lo normal en todo el país. La primera región, que abarca el litoral oeste y el norte, tiene un 50% de probabilidad de estar en el tercil superior, mientras que un 30% se asigna al tercil medio y un 20% al inferior. En la segunda región, que incluye el resto del territorio, se estima un 40% de probabilidad tanto en los terciles superior como medio, y un 20% para el inferior.\nTe recomendamos\nCompartí tu opinión con toda la comunidad\n[Si no puedes comentar, envianos un mensaje](#)",

    "title": "El \"carrito\" que Luka Doncic dio de regalo navideño de y que alegró a los Dallas Mavericks",
    "text": "Con todo el espíritu navideño de su parte, Luka Doncic, la estrella eslovena de los Dallas Mavericks, volvió a demostrar su aprecio y cercanía con el resto de sus compañeros y el cuerpo técnico con un regalo único: karts personalizados entregados en los interiores del American Airlines Center, hogar de la franquicia texana.\nEl gesto, que tomó por sorpresa a todos, se hizo viral luego de que las redes sociales de los 'Mavs' compartieran un video del momento. En el clip, titulado \"Luka está difundiendo la alegría navideña una vez más\", se ve a los integrantes del equipo recorriendo el recinto con los karts decorados con lazos festivos.\nUno de los receptores más emocionados con el detalle navideño fue Klay Thompson, el flamante fichaje de los Mavericks que llegó recientemente de los Golden State Warriors, con el cual Doncic reforzó su compromiso de fortalecer la camaradería dentro del equipo, algo que ha sido una constante desde su llegada a la NBA.\nUn precedente con bicicletas eléctricas\nNo es la primera vez que Luka Doncic sorprende a sus compañeros en las fiestas decembrinas. En 2023, el jugador regaló bicicletas eléctricas a todos los integrantes del equipo, un detalle que causó revuelo en aquel momento.\nDurante una rueda de prensa, Dante Exum, uno de sus compañeros en los Mavericks, recordó con entusiasmo cómo encontraron las bicicletas al regresar al vestuario tras un triunfo contra los San Antonio Spurs. “Fue una verdadera sorpresa. Entramos al vestuario y lo primero que vimos fueron bicicletas formadas. Fue un gran regalo y una muestra del amor navideño\"\nDoncic: más que un líder en la cancha\nLos gestos de Luka Doncic en estas fechas refuerzan su imagen como líder no solo dentro de la cancha, sino también fuera de ella. Con estas acciones, el jugador mantiene su relación especial con los Dallas Mavericks para consolidarse como un referente tanto para el equipo como para sus seguidores.\nSin duda, el impacto de Doncic va más allá de sus habilidades deportivas tras demostrar que también sabe cómo difundir la alegría y el espíritu navideño entre quienes lo rodean.",

    "text": "Marcela Tinayre supo posicionarse como una gran conductora, siguiendo los pasos de su madre, la legendaria Mirtha Legrand. Este jueves, visitó el programa Cortá por Lozano y se animó al diván con Verónica Lozano, en donde habló, entre otras cosas, de la relación con su madre. Tinayre se refirió a cómo su madre se mantiene vigente, informada y aggiornada a los tiempos que corren, más allá de tener 97 años. “Está muy indignada con todo lo que está pasando”, dijo, sin especificar un problema en particular. Enseguida, Lozano recordó la frase que la reina de los almuerzos expresó cuando analizaban el escándalo de Alberto Fernández, más precisamente los dichos y el material que lo involucran con algunas mujeres. “Gordo, con bigote”, parafraseó Lozano, haciendo referencia a que Mirtha se mostró sorprendida de que el expresidente tuviera “tantas conquistas” pese a su apariencia física “poco agraciada”, según su punto de vista. “Me quería morir” Marcela Tinayre se tomó la cabeza cuando la conductora de Telefe le recordó ese momento y confesó: “Me quería morir cuando la escuché. Cuando la escuché que dijo ‘el gordo’ dije ‘uffff’”. “Porque tu mamá y vos siempre han sido muy ‘fisiqueras’ con los varones que han elegido”, ahondó Lozano y aclaró que hablaba de “gusto, más allá de tener o no un vínculo”. “Yo soy más del bocho”, señaló Tinayre, en cuanto a que se siente más atraída por la inteligencia que por el físico. “¿Te has enamorado de algún famoso que no sepamos?”, preguntó la conductora y la hija de Mirtha sorprendió con su respuesta: “Sí, miles”, y reconoció que “con algunos hubo fuego y con otros, no”. “Le digo a mamá: estoy muerta con fulano de tal. Y me dijo: ‘Pero es tan feo’”, comentó acerca de una de las desopilantes opiniones de Mirtha.",

    "text": "La rupture conventionnelle collective s'applique uniquement aux salariés volontaires du siège de l'enseigne. Aucun collaborateur des magasins n'est concerné, a précisé Castorama dans un communiqué reçu vendredi. Ce dispositif s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un plan stratégique de Castorama lancé en mars, qui a pour objectif de redresser sa rentabilité et l'aider à rester compétitif dans un contexte concurrentiel en constante évolution, a ajouté l'entreprise. Enseigne du groupe britannique Kingfisher, Castorama compte au total plus de 11.000 collaborateurs et 95 magasins en France. Après avoir connu un boom du bricolage durant la pandémie de Covid-19, le secteur déchante en France. Au troisième trimestre, les ventes de Castorama ont reculé de 4,9% sur un an, selon les derniers résultats de Kingfisher publiés lundi. Le groupe britannique, également propriétaire de Brico Dépôt (dont les ventes ont décliné de 3,3% sur la même période), a mis ces mauvais chiffres sur le compte de la faiblesse du moral des consommateurs et de conditions météorologiques défavorables. Grand rival de Castorama, Leroy Merlin a aussi procédé à une rupture conventionnelle collective ces derniers mois dans son siège de Lezennes, dans la banlieue lilloise, entraînant le départ de 130 collaborateurs, a indiqué l'enseigne à l'AFP vendredi, confirmant des informations des Echos. Le chiffre d'affaires de Leroy Merlin enregistre un recul à l'image du marché, a ajouté une porte-parole, sans détailler davantage. En cause essentiellement, la baisse des transactions immobilières et des naissances, qui amoindrit les travaux effectués par les Français, a-t-elle expliqué. Comptant environ 30.000 collaborateurs et 144 magasins en France selon son site, Leroy Merlin appartient à la galaxie Mulliez, également propriétaire du distributeur Auchan, lequel a annoncé début novembre un plan social massif menaçant 2.389 emplois en France.",
