    "title": "19 U.S. National Parks You Can Visit For Free All Year Round - AFAR",
    "text": "The United States is home to some of the most breathtaking landscapes in the world, many preserved within its vast network of national parks. From towering mountains and lush forests to arid deserts and sweeping coastlines, these protected areas offer unparalleled opportunities for outdoor adventure, wildlife viewing, and a connection to nature. Best of all, many of these parks are open to the public without any entrance fees, making them accessible to everyone. Here’s what you need to know about which national parks in the United States are free to visit—and what to do in some of the most exciting parks. The national parks that are always free Of the 63 full-fledged national parks in the United States, 19 are free to visit every day of the year (the other 44 are [fee-free six times a year](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-to-visit-the-national-parks-for-free-this-year)). The parks that never have entrance fees are: - Biscayne National Park, Florida [Channel Islands National Park](https://www.afar.com/magazine/the-essential-guide-to-channel-islands-national-park), California- Congaree National Park, South Carolina - Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Ohio - Gates of the Arctic National Park, Alaska - Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri - Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska - Great Basin National Park, Nevada [Great Smoky Mountains National Park](https://www.afar.com/travel-guides/united-states/tennessee/great-smoky-mountains/guide), North Carolina and Tennessee- Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas - Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska - Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska - Lake Clark National Park, Alaska [New River Gorge National Park](https://www.afar.com/magazine/guide-new-river-gorge-national-park-wv), West Virginia- North Cascades National Park, Washington [Redwood National Park](https://www.afar.com/travel-guides/united-states/california/redwood-national-park/guide), California- Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota - Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota - Wrangell–St. Elias National Park, Alaska Why aren’t all national parks free to visit? National parks are not just places of incredible beauty; they are ecological preserves with delicate ecosystems that need constant care, from maintaining hiking trails to controlling invasive species and conducting wildlife research. The costs of conservation are high. Fees help bridge the gap between government funding and the parks’ operational expenses, including maintenance, improvements, staff salaries, and environmental protection. They also help fund vital projects that ensure the park’s natural resources—its forests, rivers, wildlife, and landscapes—are kept healthy. The best free national parks New River Gorge National Park, West Virginia In 2020, New River Gorge became the United State’s 63rd and newest national park. Contrary to its name, the New River is considered one of the oldest rivers in the world, estimated to be 360 million years old. Its deep gorge was carved over millennia, creating dramatic cliffs, scenic overlooks, and whitewater rapids that form the park’s defining features. At the heart of the park lies the iconic New River Gorge Bridge, one of world’s the longest single-span arch bridges. Every October, during [Bridge Day](https://officialbridgeday.com/), this engineering marvel becomes the stage from which base jumpers to leap to the abyss below. Another exhilarating way to experience the New River is by going white water rafting. The Upper New River offers a gentler experience, perfect for families or beginners, while the Lower New River is famous for its challenging Class IV and V rapids, ideal for seasoned thrill seekers. Great Basin National Park, Nevada This wildly [underrated national park](https://www.afar.com/magazine/underrated-us-national-parks) is a study in contrasts. Stretching over 77,000 acres, the park is dominated by the majestic Wheeler Peak, which rises 13,063 feet above sea level. One of the park’s most unique features is its juxtaposition of dry desert basins and the greenery surrounding mountain streams and glacial valleys. This creates a surprising diversity of plant and animal life, including mule deer, bighorn sheep, and more than 230 species of birds. Great Basin National Park is one of the few places in the United States that has been [designated an International Dark Sky Park](https://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/great-basin-stargazing.htm). Far from the pollution of city lights, the park offers Milky Way views so you can see stars, planets, and even distant galaxies with the naked eye. Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska While most of [Alaska’s national parks](https://www.afar.com/magazine/essential-alaska-national-parks-to-visit) are free to visit, they’re not the most accessible: They are either far-flung or require some serious outdoorsy skills to explore. However, Kenai Fjords, just two hours from Anchorage by car, not only is easy to visit but also offers nature enthusiasts a chance to choose their own adventure. One of the park’s main attractions is the Harding Icefield, a colossal expanse of ice that feeds more than 40 glaciers. Ranger-led glacier walks share insight into the area’s geology and the impacts of climate change. Alternatively, a boat tour through the fjords gives travelers close-up views of glaciers calving into the sea. Redwood National Park, California The eponymous trees are the undeniable stars of Redwood National Park. Stretching skyward to dizzying heights—some more than 350 feet—these colossal trees have been standing for centuries, with the oldest estimated to be more than 2,000 years old. Popular trails such as the [Tall Trees Grove](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/talltreeshike.htm) and the [Lady Bird Johnson Grove](https://www.nps.gov/places/lbjtrailhead.htm) offer some of the best opportunities to immerse yourself in this ancient forest. The park’s ecosystem is incredibly diverse, encompassing rugged coastal cliffs, sandy beaches, and open prairies. If you’re a beach lover, take a trip to [Gold Bluffs Beach](https://www.visitredwoods.com/listing/gold-bluffs-beach-%26-campground/529/), where the wild, windswept coastline meets crashing Pacific waves.",

Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\nGot it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Neighbours who live next to the Peninsula Hot Springs claim it has breached planning permits, turning the destination from a place of relaxation to a noisy festival site.\nA permit application for an overflow car park has turned into a flashpoint for residents’ concerns about the hot springs , with the dispute set to go to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.\nSophie Boutopoulos and Elizabeth Stigter live near the Peninsula Hot Springs and are concerned about its expansion. Credit: Penny Stephens\nAn initial permit was granted in 2017 for a carpark for 30 cars for a six-month period, but since then the attraction has used the area for staff and overflow parking for hundreds of cars.\nIn December, the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council unanimously rejected an application by the Peninsula Hot Springs for a permit for the car park to hold 454 cars.\nElizabeth Stigter has lived near the Peninsula Hot Springs for 20 years and said in the last few years the venue had “dramatically” increased its patron numbers and turned into a festival site.\nLoading “We can hear patrons laughing and yelling throughout the night,” she told the council meeting. “Scheduled concerts and movie nights can be heard within our homes. Clapping, chanting and screams from all events can be heard within our homes until 10pm.”\nIn 2018 the Peninsula Hot Springs opened a $13 million expansion, adding several hot and cold pools and an amphitheatre, followed by glamping facilitie s in 2020 and eco-lodges in 2024 .\nIt hosts DJs on Thursdays during January, live music every Sunday and an annual hot springs “wellness gathering” called Awaken.\nAdvertisement The springs hold about 800 patrons at a time, with a self-imposed limit of 3000 each day.\nResidents of nearby Devonport Drive said the expansion had changed the nature of the hot springs and the council meeting had received 66 objections to the planning application for the car park.\nObjectors raised concerns about the site already being used as a car park without relevant permissions, the additional car parking resulting in increased patronage numbers, proximity to areas of cultural heritage, bushfire risk, and the impact on wildlife, vegetation and amenity.\nThe expanded amphitheatre pools area at the Peninsula Hot Springs.\nTeresa Madgewick told the council meeting that at first her family was happy to live near the Peninsula Hot Springs but increased operational hours and patronage had changed her views.\n“What was a quiet area both day and night is one which has been replaced by music, screaming and chatter instead of birds and silence,” she said. “We loved the idea of a retreat allowing people to relax and revive, it suited the vibe of the area and we thought it was a perfect use of space. It has now become party, party, party with both extension of hours and alcohol.”\nMichael Stephens, chairman of the owners’ corporation of the Moonah Links Residential Estate, said the council and its planning department needed to hold Peninsula Hot Springs to account.\n“The applicant has been cavalier in their compliance with permit conditions since day one, applying a ‘Don’t ask permission and beg forgiveness approach’ time and again,” he said.\nCouncillor David Gill said he was concerned that the Peninsula Hot Springs continued to obtain amendments to its original planning permit.\n“I think matters have got out of kilter with what a planning permit should be,” he said. “I think initially everyone approved of the idea of a health and wellbeing centre and a spring, but it is not that any more, it is a major event space.”\nMornington Peninsula Shire mayor Anthony Marsh said he understood the concerns of residents living near the hot springs.\nThe hilltop pool at Peninsula Hot Springs.\n“An informal agreement to use the land as an overflow car park was in place last year while the planning permit was being assessed,” he said. “Since council refused the permit application in late December, our officers have been addressing compliance concerns at the site. We recently lodged an application with VCAT seeking orders requiring the operator to stop using the land as a car park. Once that has been achieved, we will work with the operator on a remediation plan.”\nA spokeswoman for the Peninsula Hot Springs said its intent had always been to foster a sanctuary for relaxation and a deeper connection with nature.\nLoading “Our planning permit application seeks to formalise an existing overflow and staff parking area, ensuring the continued safe operations of our facilities,” she said.\n“As the council’s recent decision has initiated a review by VCAT, it is not appropriate for us to comment on the specifics at this time. We remain committed to open and constructive collaboration with council to continue to work towards thoughtful solutions that balance community needs while maintaining our focus on wellness tourism.”\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
