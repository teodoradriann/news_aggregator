    "text": "With temps dropping across the Ozarks many choosing not to utilize warming centers SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - Many people who could utilize homeless shelters choose to brave the elements independently. They have their reasons, but one thing remains the same: it’s dangerous in the cold. “It came down to a point where I actually had to drink to stay warm,” said Travis Seek, a homeless man living at the Victory Mission. Travis Seek has been in and out of poverty for decades. In August of 2022, he found himself homeless in Springfield. Despite his issues, he wouldn’t go to a shelter. “I would never would go into homeless shelters or anything of that nature,” said Seek. “Always was couch surfing and partying.” In December of 2022, that all changed. Cold weather came for the Ozarks with a vengeance, with wind-chills nearing -40 degrees. Seek says he saw many friends lose fingers and toes to the cold. “Frozen toes, frozen feet, frozen ear lobes,” said Seek. “Yeah, black just turned black. I’ve seen your lobes turn black. Lips turn black, blue, and black. Toes are missing. I have a friend who actually got four of his toes missing from the cold weather. (He’s) trying to stay in an abandoned house, trying to stay warm.” He says that stuck with him. So when he exited jail in December 2022, the cab they called brought him to Victory Mission. He’s been there ever since. He says pride was the main reason he didn’t want to utilize shelters or warming centers. “Pride and ego,” said Seek. “I always thought I was better than most people that come to a homeless shelter. I wasn’t able, you know, they got rules. And you know, kind of lived in a rebellious lifestyle where I didn’t accept rules. So I can you can’t drink here, you can’t do drugs. You can’t. You can’t bring women. Everything’s separated. You got rules to follow.” It’s an issue that many face. Mindy McDonald with Victory Mission says it’s a multi-faceted issue. Some don’t want to give up independence, and some don’t want to share living space. The main issues, though, are safety and drug use. I think the drug and alcohol policy is a huge element,” said McDonald. “And honestly, it really helps with the safety factor. But that can be a barrier for somebody who, you know, substance use and mental health often it’s a lot more nuanced than just being sober not being sober.” [CLICK HERE ](https://www.ky3.com/2023/12/18/see-list-cold-weather-shelters-ozarks/)for a list of cold weather shelters in Springfield and across Missouri.

    "text": "«Un día feliz y de agradecimiento». Así definió Amelia, una de las más de 60 personas que llegaron desde Gaza a Badajoz, la jornada que las once familias hispano-palestinas vivieron ayer en el edificio de Fundación CB.\nVarias entidades de la ciudad se han unido en pro de regalar a estas familias juguetes y artículos de primera necesidad. La iniciativa partió del colectivo SOS Casco Antiguo, que tiene sede en El Revellín, por lo que para los miembros del colectivo era inevitable cruzarse con ‘sus vecinos’ e interesarse por conocer de primera mano su situación. Ellos se pusieron en contacto con Fundación CB y, junto a la asociación de comerciantes de la calle Menacho, hicieron el resto. «Quisimos saber qué necesitábais y proporcionároslo desde esta que, desde ahora, será vuestra casa», dijo Emilio Vázquez, presidente de la fundación.\nEn un acto que estuvo repleto de magia -literal y figuradamente, pues el Gran Mago Chicky hizo varios de sus juegos a los niños-, las once familias recogieron una maleta llena de ropa nueva así como una gran bolsa de juguetes para los pequeños de la casa. Estos no pudieron resistir la tentación de estrenarlos nada más recibirlos. «Por fin vuelvo a tener un juego, todos los míos se quedaron en Gaza», explicaba Easama, que estaba deseando estrenar su kit para hacer perfumes. La niña sonreía.\nUno de los asuntos que más preocupa a los colectivos es la no escolarización de los más pequeños, por lo que, «mientras se arregla la situación», dijo Vázquez, han decidido propiciar clases de español para todos los niños y jóvenes que continúan en el albergue. Este alojamiento que, como recordó Luis Pacheco, de SOS Casco Antiguo, se les ofreció como una solución habitacional de forma temporal aunque a día de hoy no parece que haya visos de traslado.\nEstas futuras clases emocionaron especialmente a la comunidad gazatí. Todas las familias están preocupadas por la situación de los niños. «Aún no sabemos nada cierto sobre nuestro futuro», dijo Amelia, «los días son monótonos».",

    "text": "El riquísimo y servil Mark Zuckerberg, dueño de Meta (Facebook e Instagram), ferviente adorador de Trump, va a darles la patada a los verificadores que velaban para que sus redes no fueran una autopista para el contenido falso y las estafas de todo tipo y pelaje. Cuando Zuckerberg dice que relaja los controles y «reduce la censura», falta a la verdad. Lo que está haciendo es hacer más vulnerables a los usuarios. Para comerse bulos, para creerse imágenes falsas y para ser víctimas de delitos.\nInformarse en las redes nunca fue una buena idea. Son plataformas que adoran la rentabilidad. No les importa la calidad o la veracidad. Si algo da tráfico, lo privilegian, aunque sea falso y a cambio estén incendiando un país o generando una campaña de odio.\nDel Twitter que cerró la cuenta a Trump (vuelve a hacer de «hombre loco» como en el 2016) por alentar un golpe de Estado hemos pasado al X de Musk, que alzaprima mensajes ultras , amenaza a las democracias y pone como enemigos a los medios de comunicación.\n¿Se operarían ustedes en la trastienda de una peluquería o un salón de uñas? Pues lo mismo vale para la información. Si no quieren vivir en un «mundo sin hechos» ( expresión certera acuñada por María Ressa, premio Nobel de la Paz ), desconfíen de las redes y sus algoritmos tramposos. Naveguen de forma consciente y activa. Sean críticos. Prescindan de los intermediarios tóxicos. Y, por favor, lean las noticias en los sitios que las elaboran y responden por ellas. Para controlar los excesos de las plataformas social media , solo tengo una receta: regulación, regulación y regulación.",

    "title": "‘If Jesus was born today, he’d be born under the rubble’: Bethlehem set for forlorn Christmas | Israel-Gaza war | The Guardian",
    "text": "A t Bethlehem’s Lutheran Evangelical church, the nativity scene looks very different this Christmas. Instead of a cot in a hay-filled manger, the baby doll has been wrapped in the famous black and white keffiyeh associated with Palestine, and lies among broken breeze blocks and paving slabs.\nChristmas celebrations have been cancelled across the Holy Land this year as the region mourns the Palestinians – now more than 20,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip – killed in the new war between Israel and the militant group. Munther Isaac, the pastor of the Lutheran church, said he wanted to send the world a message with this year’s nativity scene. “This is the reality of Christmas for Palestinian children,” he said. “If Jesus was born today, he’d be born under the rubble of Gaza.”\nBethlehem, six miles south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, is one of the most important centres of Christianity; the Church of the Nativity, today shared by several sects, was built by Emperor Justinian 1,500 years ago above the grotto where it is believed Christ was born.\nA souvenir shop in Bethlehem opens its doors for business in a city devoid of tourists. Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty Images Today, the majority of Bethlehem’s population is Muslim but the town is still home to a thriving Christian community and many Christian orders, and the area relies heavily on the tourism and pilgrimage sector. Around 70% of the Bethlehem economy depends on international visitors, said the mayor, Hana Haniyeh.\n“This period is usually very active. We get 1.5 - 2 million visitors a year, but now we have zero,” he said. “Israel has made it very difficult to get here through the checkpoints and our economy has crashed, but we could not celebrate anyway. We are in mourning for the people of Gaza .”\nSince the occupied Palestinian territories do not have an airport, most international visitors enter through Israel, crossing checkpoints in its West Bank barrier wall that keeps the two holy cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem separate from one another, despite the fact that they’re only six miles (10km) apart.\nManger Square in the heart of Bethlehem, outside the Church of the Nativity, is usually thronged with tourists in December. There are festive lights, a giant Christmas tree, and the town’s alleyways and restaurants are filled with music. This year though, Manger Square is grey and empty. No one the Observer spoke to in Bethlehem on Friday could recall a time that there was no traditional tree. Outside the Bethlehem Peace Center, a banner said in Arabic and English: “Stop the genocide, stop the displacement, lift the blockade”.\nThe busy December programme includes hosting international delegations and performances from artists and singers before the festivities culminate with a parade and midnight mass on Christmas Eve. But attendance is expected to be so low this year that the Franciscan order that assigns tickets and deals with security for the event has scrapped the usual protocols; instead, the prayer service will be open to anyone who can make it.\nmap Weathering the pandemic was a challenge, but last year Bethlehem’s 5,000 hotel rooms were once again fully booked over Christmas, and were set to do good business again in 2023 before the war broke out.\n“I would get 50 tour groups a month in my shop. All the hotels were reserved again this year and we expected it to be great but that dream was shattered because of the conflict. Everyone cancelled,” said Nabil Giacaman, a third-generation woodworker, and owner of the Il Bambino arts and sculpture shop. His was the only shop open on Friday; he said he had come by just to keep himself busy.\n“I have 12 employees but I don’t think I can pay them at the end of the month,” he said. “We desperately need the tourists.”\nMillions of pilgrims usually visit every year, but very few Christians live in the Holy Land. A century ago, they made up a quarter of Jerusalem’s population but now represent less than 2%. The community struggles to afford housing, and the West Bank security wall has isolated them from their brethren in Bethlehem.\nToday there are just 182,000 Christians in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and 1,300 in Gaza, according to US state department estimates. When the Islamist group Hamas seized control of the strip in 2007 , 3,000 Christians were registered as living there. In the besieged territory, the already tiny Christian community has been decimated by the new war, sparked by the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas that killed 1,140 people.\nThe Catholic Holy Family church in Gaza City has become a makeshift shelter but has been repeatedly hit by Israeli airstrikes. Last week, the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had placed the church under siege, and snipers shot and killed two Christian women , a mother and daughter, who had ventured outside for food and water. Pope Francis condemned the attack, which the IDF denied knowledge of.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition\nFree daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty Images The Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, Layla Moran, has said she worries that her family members and the other 300 people trapped at the church will not survive until Christmas.\nIn Jerusalem, too, Christmas festivities were cancelled by heads of the major churches. The ancient passageways of the Old City, normally full of tourists and pilgrims throughout the year, have been quiet since October. Most shops and restaurants are closed, with business owners saying they are too scared to come to work.\nIsraeli settlers in the Old City – like the rest of East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel in 1980 – have used the chaos of the war to their advantage. There have been attempts by Israeli developers to seize land in the Armenian quarter that belongs to both the church and individual Armenian Christians; members of the 800-strong community are now camping out 24 hours a day on sites they believe are under threat.\nBoth the Muslim and Christian presence in the Old City and its surroundings were steadily being eroded anyway, owing to efforts by settlers as well as the Israeli government. Over the last few years, the state has accelerated its campaign to demolish increasing numbers of Palestinian homes on the grounds they lack building permits, and displace the community with development projects.\nChristian leaders in Israel and Palestine generally refrain from commenting on current affairs, but the outpouring of grief and condemnation of the war from the patriarchates this year shows the depth of the anger many of the churches feel.\n“We are sad at seeing all the victims, especially women and children, and we are sad that the international community hasn’t taken serious action to end the massacre, as they did when Russia invaded Ukraine,” said Father Rami Askarieh, the parish priest of Bethlehem’s St Catherine’s church.\n“We pray each day for Gaza and for the victims of the war on both sides,” he said. “Israelis, Palestinians; we are all human, we are all the children of God.”\nExplore more on these topics Israel-Gaza war The Observer Israel Gaza Hamas Bethlehem Palestinian territories Middle East and north Africa features\nReuse this content",
