Guadalupe Torres Sánchez dijo que se garantiza el apoyo a los productores de esta importante hortaliza a través de la Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico (Sedeco) y la Secretaría de Desarrollo Agropecuario y Recursos Hidráulicos (Sedarh).\nMencionó que a pesar de que esa medida se aplicaría probablemente en julio, el Gobierno Estatal estará preparado para que productores agrícolas sigan contando con todo el apoyo a fin de que sean afectados lo menos posible.",

Nwosisi’s Nigeria-based co‑conspirators induced victims to make large wire payments to bank accounts in the United States on the false belief that payment of the purported advance fees was necessary before the bank would release their funding or inheritance. Nwosisi served as a money launderer who accepted victim funds into his U.S.-based bank accounts and directed the proceeds to the ringleaders in Nigeria.\nA federal jury in Houston convicted Nwosisi on March 4 of conspiracy to commit money laundering and concealment money laundering.\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas; Special Agent in Charge Douglas A. Williams Jr. of the FBI Houston Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Christopher Hileman of the Department of State Office of Inspector General (DOS-OIG) made the announcement.\nThe FBI and DOS-OIG investigated the case.\nTrial Attorney Philip Trout of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Christian Latham for the Southern District of Texas prosecuted the case.\nUpdated June 13, 2024",

    "text": "VIJAYAWADA : In the first 23 days of the current water year, Andhra Pradesh has recorded 50.2% excess rainfall than normal. The State has logged 118.7 mm rainfall as against the normal of 78.9 mm.\nOut of 26 districts, 10 reported large excess rainfall, nine logged excess rainfall, four received normal rainfall and the remaining three reported deficit rainfall.\nThe onset of the South West Monsoon this year has been on time. The above normal rainfall expected in the State has been attributed to favourable conditions. While farmers are happy that the State is receiving more than normal rainfall, they have raised concerns over the low water levels in various reservoirs.\nAccording to data from the State Planning Department and the Water Resources Department, rainfall in June 2023 was just 65.8 mm as against the normal rainfall of 96 mm. The reason for this deficit was the delayed onset of monsoon and dry spells.\nThis year, however, the State has recorded good rainfall, particularly in the Rayalaseema region. Among the 10 districts which received large excess rainfall in the last 23 days, eight are in Rayalaseema.\nThey are: Kurnool, Nandyal, Anantapur, Sri Satya Sai, YSR, Annamaiah, Chittoor, and Tirupati. The other two districts are Kakinada and Prakasam.\nDespite above normal rainfall, low water levels in dams pose a concern\nOn the other hand, excess rainfall was logged in Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, Anakapalle, Dr BR Ambedkar Konaseema, East Godavari, Eluru, Krishna, Bapatla, and Nellore. Normal rainfall was recorded in West Godavari, NTR, Guntur, and Palnadu districts while deficit rainfall was reported in Srikakulam, Paravathipuram Manyam, and Alluri Sitarama Raju districts.\nAt 202.5% more rains than normal, Nandyal district reported the highest excess rainfall. As against normal rainfall of 63.6 mm, Nandyal district received 192.4 mm. Anantapur stood second as it recorded 182.1% more than normal rainfall. As against the normal rainfall of 51.9 mm, Chittoor district logged 146.4 mm, recording the third highest excess rainfall of 163.5%.\nOn the other hand, the highest deficit rainfall was reported in Srikakulam district, which received 32.8% less rainfall than normal. As against the normal rainfall of 117.2 mm, the district received 78.7 mm only. It was followed by Alluri Sitarama Raju with 32% less rainfall and Parvathipuram Manyam district with 26.8% less rainfall.\nAs against the normal of rainfall of 133.3 mm, ASR district received 90.7 mm. Similarly, Parvathipuram-Manyam district received 83.2 mm rainfall as against the normal of 113.7 mm.\nDespite the above normal rainfall, low water levels in reservoirs is a matter of concern. “The rainfall we are getting is a good sign, but the water levels in the reservoirs can increase only with copious inflows from upstream. However, due to less rainfall in the Western Ghats, inflows are not that encouraging till now,” said a senior official at the Srisailam Reservoir.\nAs per the Water Resources Department’s data, as of June 23, 2024, water levels in the Srisailam Project are at 815 feet against the Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 885 feet. Current storage was 37.35 TMC as against the 33.42 TMC on the same day last year.\nWater levels at Nagarjuna Sagar are 504.3 feet against the FRL of 590.55 feet. Storage levels as of date are 122.2 TMC as against 149.09 TMC on the same day last year.\nSimilarly, water levels at the Pulichintala Project stood at 94.32 feet against the FRL of 175 feet. Storage levels as of date are 0.39 TMC as against 42.62 TMC on the same day last year.\nThe total water available in all reservoirs across the State as of date is 233.59 TMC, which is 23.75 % of the gross capacity at FRL of 983.49 TMC.",

They urged the ministry to closely review the current process and eliminate unnecessary obstacles for Moavineen who wish to serve pilgrims with religious spirit.\nThe members emphasised the need for the ministry to adopt more practical selection process from the next year instead of relying on NTS, which imposes a high-test fee and other expenses. The committee recommended that the ministry arrange proper training courses for the selected candidates in accordance with Hajj Ta’leemaat.\nBriefing the committee, Additional Secretary In-Charge of Religious Affairs Ministry, Dr Atta-ur-Rehman, stated that lobbying for Moavineen positions has always been strong, which is why a transparent screening process was introduced through NTS. The selection tests were conducted through a public sector testing company, as per the Islamabad High Court (IHC)’s directive. The Law Ministry has officially declared NTS a government-approved testing service.\nAfter a thorough discussion, Chairman Malik Muhammad Aamir Dogar directed the ministry to submit the NTS exam paper, the list of selected Moavineen, and details of the selection process in other Muslim countries at the next committee meeting.\nThe Secretary also briefed the Committee on the establishment of a recycling plant for sacred papers which is being constructed in accordance with Shariah principles and modern scientific standards, is expected to be completed by June 2025. He informed the Committee that the plant is being set up at the Haji Camp in Islamabad, which is the ministry’s own property.\nThe Committee expressed immense interest in the recycling plant for sacred papers and directed the ministry to arrange a visit to the Haji Camp Islamabad, along with a detailed briefing on the plant, in the next meeting. The Chair emphasised the need for similar plants in provincial headquarters and recommended their eventual expansion to the city level.\nThe committee directed the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony to develop an alternative plan and explore options for Hajj pilgrims who wish to perform Hajj by road or by sea, and present its plan in the next meeting of the committee.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025\nhajj NA panel Hajj Moavineen Malik Muhammad Aamir Dogar Comments 200 characters Print\nRs20bn Ramazan relief: payments to be made in cash",

    "text": "Cornerback Calls Eagles A Perfect Fit, Praises Quinyon Mitchell, Cooper DeJean\nPHILADELPHIA – Had cornerback Adoree Jackson decided to join the Eagles four years ago instead of the Giants, he would have won a Super Bowl already and played in two. Philly wanted him in 2020 when he became a free agent of the Titans. Jackson didn’t want the Eagles.\n“The difference for me was just the timing of everything, just where I was at,” said Jackson, who is now just a handful of months from turning 30 and signed a one-year free-agent contract with the Eagles days after the market opened on March 12.\n“Coming from Tennessee to New York, it kind of reminded me of SC (USC) Being in the market, being in the city in that aspect. That's where I leaned towards.”\nJackson, who spoke via video call on Wednesday afternoon, said he knew some of the Giants players, such as Kenny Golladay, Leonard Williams, Jabril Peppers, and two who escaped New York to join the Eagles – James Bradberry and Saquon Barkley.\n“At the time, it was perfect for me,” he said.\nMuch has changed with the Eagles, too. In addition to playing in two Super Bowls and winning one, they have seen veteran Darius Slay move in on free agency this offseason and added a pair of rookie standouts in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean last spring.\n“I'm not gonna lie, I really liked Mitchell,” said Jackson. “I saw a game we were watching on tape and I'm like, ‘Damn, I haven't seen a rookie play that well. It's been a while.' Then Cooper doing his thing. That was a trip, because they had the first white DB since whenever.\n“To see him thrive and do his thing, it made me smile. It's always cool to see somebody else, especially the position that you're in and how tough it is, to see those two thrive - it put a smile on my face.”\nEven as he approaches 30, Jackson believes he can still play at a high level, and believes he will have plenty to offer a young defensive back room in Philly.\n“Being one of the oldest in the room is cool,” he said. “I came in as one of the youngest. It's just the circle of life. It's a part of the game. I appreciate being a part of this position. To reach this age and be able to give back, I'm excited for the opportunity.”\nMore NFL: Eagles Linebacker Talks Contract, Focused On Players Returning, Not Those Leaving",

    "text": "Mastering Spring Boot Cache Eviction: A Comprehensive Guide for Optimal Performance Caching is a cornerstone of high-performance Spring Boot applications, and a nuanced understanding of cache eviction policies is essential for maintaining efficiency and responsiveness. In this detailed exploration, we’ll delve into the significance of cache eviction, unravel the default eviction policies in Spring Boot, and explore advanced customization options to ensure your caching strategy aligns seamlessly with your application’s unique requirements. The Crucial Role of Cache Eviction Caching accelerates application performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated and potentially resource-intensive database or network calls. However, as the cached dataset grows, the effective management of cached entries becomes imperative to prevent memory saturation and to ensure that the cached data remains relevant. Default Cache Eviction Policies in Spring Boot Spring Boot, leveraging the powerful Spring Framework, incorporates default eviction policies that govern the removal of entries from the cache. Two primary eviction policies stand out in this context: Least Recently Used (LRU) Eviction Policy The LRU eviction policy is designed to remove the least recently used entries from the cache when it approaches its maximum size. This ensures that the most frequently accessed data stays in the cache, optimizing for the principle of temporal locality. Consider the following example utilizing the @Cacheable annotation with an LRU eviction policy: import org.springframework.cache.annotation.CacheConfig; import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable; import org.springframework.stereotype.Service; @Service @CacheConfig(cacheNames = \"userCache\") public class UserDataService { @Cacheable(key = \"#userId\") public User getUserData(String userId) { // Simulating fetching user data from the database System.out.println(\"Fetching user data from the database for user id: \" + userId); return new User(userId, \"John Doe\"); } }",

    "text": "Former Lineman for Razorbacks Now Cult Hero for Best in NFL\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. â€” Don't feel bad if you didn't predict Dan Skipper's success in the NFL. Other that some notable holding calls and a blocked extra point against TCU he really didn't have that many big plays.\nNobody really expected him to become the cult hero he's become with Detroit fans as they get ready to begin their playoff run. The Lions have the best record in the NFL this year along with the Kansas City Chiefs and now he's a cult hero.\nEven ESPN pointed that out in a story ahead of their playoff matchup Saturday against the Washington Commanders. It exploded when he caught a touchdown in the final regular-season game against the Buffalo Bills.\nEveryone has taken notice if they're paying attention. At 6-foot-9 he stands out in a crowd. Now he can't hide in Detroit where fans react to hearing an official announce No. 70 is eligible in a game. Considering his size, the fact some defenses can't seem to find him in games is even more surprising.\nHe'd bounced around the league so much, when the Indianapolis Colts let him go in 2023, Skipper was ticked off. They had a player personnel guy do it. He landed with the Lions shortly after that.\nSkipper has started in Detroit, but the future may be more backup roles. Until he physically can't handle anything, though, he'll get training camp shots. The Lions have become his biggest fan beause coach Dan Campbell seems to like guys that play like Skipper.\nHe even presented him with a game ball this season.\nAll of that's the regular season. Now it's moved into money time for the NFL, which is the playoffs and Detroit is one of the favorites in the NFC, the Chiefs are in the AFC.\nAbout the only thing Skipper could do to reach an even higher grade with the Detroit fans would be winning a Super Bowl ... and having a key catch as a specialty tight end,",
