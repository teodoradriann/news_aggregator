    "text": "Mother and friend of woman killed by husband honoured for work on domestic abuse By Press Association December 29 2023, 10.36pm Share Mother and friend of woman killed by husband honoured for work on domestic abuse Share via Facebook Twitter Linkedin Whatsapp Messenger Email Post link https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk-world/4853707/mother-and-friend-of-woman-killed-by-husband-honoured-for-work-on-domestic-abuse/ Copy Link Joanna Simpson’s mother, Diana Parkes (left) and best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton, have been honoured for their work against domestic violence (Aaron Chown/PA)\nThe best friend of a woman who was bludgeoned to death by her husband said she is “deeply moved and overwhelmed” to feature in the New Year Honours list as she called for more to be done to tackle domestic abuse.\nHetti Barkworth-Nanton, who has been made a CBE for services to people affected by domestic abuse and homicide, acknowledged that the honour would not be happening “were it not for my beautiful friend Joanna Simpson, who lost her life so brutally at the hands of her estranged husband”.\nMs Simpson was beaten to death with a claw hammer by Robert Brown in their family home in October 2010, as their two young children cowered in a playroom.\nJoanna Simpson was bludgeoned to death by her husband one week before the finalisation of their divorce (Thames Valley Police/PA) Ms Simpson’s mother Diana Parkes has also been made a CBE, for services to vulnerable children suffering from domestic abuse and domestic homicide.\nBrown was cleared of Ms Simpson’s murder, having admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and was due to be released on licence in November this year after serving 13 years of a 26-year sentence.\nThe former British Airways captain, formerly of Winkfield in Berkshire, was sentenced to 24 years for manslaughter and a further two years for an offence of obstructing a coroner in the execution of his duty.\nHe killed Ms Simpson one week before the finalisation of their divorce and dumped her body in a makeshift coffin in Windsor Great Park.\nHis automatic release from prison was blocked by the Justice Secretary in October.\nRelatives and friends of Ms Simpson had called on Alex Chalk to block her killer’s automatic release, saying he remained a danger to the public, and to refer the case to the Parole Board – something he did after pledging to “give this case my closest personal attention”.\nThe Ministry of Justice said the board, an independent body that carries out risk assessments on prisoners to determine whether they can be safely released, would make a decision on whether to release Brown “in due course”.\nMs Barkworth-Nanton co-founded the Joanna Simpson Foundation alongside Ms Parkes and is also chair of domestic abuse charity Refuge.\nShe thanked Ms Parkes for “working so bravely together with me for much-needed change”.\nMs Barkworth-Nanton, who also thanked her own family for their support, hailed the honour as a “testament to those many individuals who dedicate themselves to this cause, survivors of domestic abuse who bravely tell their story, and the family and friends who support them”.\nTelling how “deeply moved and overwhelmed” she was when she found out she was to be included in the honours list, she also paid tribute to all those working in criminal justice, health and social care, law, education and human resources, who “continue to ask the right questions, and be there for survivors when they so badly need help”.\nShe said: “Today I work with and alongside many incredible colleagues, who work and volunteer for Refuge, The Joanna Simpson Foundation, and sister organisations throughout the VAWG (violence against women and girls) sector who work tirelessly to support women and children experiencing domestic abuse and whose commitment inspires me every day.\n“Whilst domestic abuse is predominantly perpetrated on women, I also recognise and applaud the work of Respect and others who provide much-needed support to men who are experiencing abuse.”\nBut she said while many things have “changed for the better”, there remains “a huge amount of work still to be done” regarding domestic abuse and violence.\nShe added: “Change must be everyone’s challenge because changing societal attitudes takes all of us. It could be affecting your sister, your mother, your daughter, your niece, your friend, your colleague, your neighbour – changing attitudes and creating a generation free from abuse is down to every one of us today.\n“We have to reach more women sooner so they can get help earlier, we have to raise awareness to help women spot the signs, we must change laws, attitudes, and behaviours in society, and that way we will ultimately save lives. I will not rest until domestic abuse is eliminated.”",

    "text": "On Catalunya\nManresa celebra 25 anys del pessebre monumental\nEls pessebristes han creat un pont de quinze metres que reprodueix un tram del Pont Llarg de la ciutat\nFira de Santa Llucia Manresa\nEl pessebre monumental és una de les activitats de Nadal de Manresa que atrau més públic. La capacitat dels seus autors, el Grup Pessebrístic de Manresa, de reinventar-se any rere any per oferir un muntatge totalment diferent de l’anterior, mantenint, això sí, els elements clàssics d’un pessebre (el naixement, els pastors, els Reis Mags i, pensant en els més petits, la cova amb els dimoniets), aconsegueix revifar cada Nadal la flama de la curiositat dels visitants.\nAquest any, el pessebre monumental compleix el seu primer quart de segle a les instal·lacions del Centre Cultural el Casino de la capital del Bages, situat al passeig de Pere III. Per a l’ocasió, els pessebristes han creat un pont de quinze metres de longitud que reprodueix un tram del Pont Llarg de la ciutat, un aqüeducte situat al camí vell de Joncadella. L’obra també inclou una reproducció del santuari de la Mare de Déu de Joncadella. El pont té tres arcs; els dels extrems permeten passar per sota i en el del mig està instal·lat el pessebre. Tenint en compte que el pont és un aqüeducte pel qual discorre l’aigua, una gravació permet sentir el so d’aquesta fluint. La instal·lació també consta d’un salt d’aigua i d’una sardana per recordar que l’any 2024 Manresa ha sigut Capital de la Sardana. S’acompanya, a més, de 25 diorames d’autors diversos que enriqueixen la visita a l’exposició.\nEl muntatge es va inaugurar el 14 de desembre, i fins al diumenge 22 del mateix mes ja l’havien visitat un total de 3.225 persones, amb una mitjana de més de 600 durant l’últim cap de setmana.\nNotícies relacionadesEl pessebre es pot visitar fins al 6 de gener, de dimarts a diumenge, de 17.30 h de la tarda a 20.30 h de la nit; i els diumenges 29 de desembre i 5 de gener, d’11.00 h del matí a 13.30 h del migdia i de 17.30 h a 20.30 h de la nit. El 31 de desembre es podrà visitar de 17.30 h a 19.30 h de la tarda. Els dilluns no festius l’exposició està tancada.\nAprofitant l’aniversari de la seva obra més emblemàtica, els pessebristes han estat convidats aquest any per la Federació Catalana de Pessebristes a crear el pessebre que llueix davant de l’altar del monestir de Montserrat entre el 27 de desembre i el 7 de gener.",

    "text": "Crise chez l’équipementier JTEKT : près de 200 salariés en sursis en France\nSur deux sites français appartenant à l’équipementier automobile JTEKT, ce sont des dizaines de salariés qui sont menacés de rapidement perdre leur emploi.\nLe vent tourne pour les sous-traitants de l’automobile avec des empois qui sautent à la pelle en Europe, y compris chez les \"gros\" du secteur. Le groupe japonais JTEKT, spécialisé dans la fabrication de systèmes de direction et de roulements, vient d’annoncer un plan de suppression de 197 postes sur ses deux sites français, à Saint-Sauveur (Côte-d’Or) et Irigny (Rhône). Une décision lourde de conséquences pour les salariés concernés, qui traduit un ralentissement préoccupant de l’activité industrielle dans certaines branches de l’automobile. Selon les informations communiquées par JTEKT et relayés par l'AFP, 85 postes sont menacés à Saint-Sauveur, tandis que 112 pourraient être supprimés à Irigny. Ces deux sites, qui emploient plusieurs centaines de personnes, sont confrontés à une baisse significative des commandes. Dans son communiqué, le groupe évoque notamment une volonté d’\"optimiser l’activité de production\" et de restaurer la compétitivité à moyen et long terme.\nUne conjoncture difficile pour les équipementiers\nSi JTEKT avait jusque-là réussi à faire face aux soubresauts du marché, notamment grâce au soutien de son principal actionnaire Toyota, la situation s’est récemment détériorée. Le groupe précise que \"l’aggravation de la crise et la contraction des carnets de commandes\" imposent désormais une réorganisation structurelle de ses activités en France. JTEKT emploie aujourd’hui 5 300 salariés en Europe, dont 1 400 en France.\nUne réorganisation \"socialement responsable\"\nConscient de l’impact social de cette décision, le groupe affirme vouloir mener cette réorganisation dans un cadre socialement responsable, en concertation avec l’ensemble des parties prenantes. Mais les syndicats s’inquiètent déjà des conséquences pour l’emploi local, dans un contexte où de nombreux équipementiers sont fragilisés par la transition vers l’électrique, la hausse des coûts et la volatilité des commandes.\nUn secteur en pleine mutation\nLe cas de JTEKT s’inscrit dans une tendance plus large qui touche de nombreux fournisseurs de l’industrie automobile. Avec la montée en puissance des véhicules électriques, les évolutions technologiques rapides et les nouvelles exigences des constructeurs, les sous-traitants sont contraints de s’adapter ou de se restructurer, souvent dans la douleur.\nJournaliste automobile digital depuis de nombreuses années, j’ai aussi un goût prononcé pour les sports mécaniques.",

    "text": "A partir del próximo jueves 4 de enero y hasta el 4 de marzo de 2024, el gobierno federal hará públicos todos los archivos sobre [el caso Ayotzinapa, donde 43 estudiantes de la normal rural Isidro Burgos fueron agredidos y, posteriormente, desaparecidos](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/nacional/2023/9/26/caso-ayotzinapa-claves-del-nuevo-informe-sobre-la-desaparicion-de-los-normalistas-783172.html) en una serie de actos violentos ocurridos el 26 de septiembre de 2014 y que son conocidos como 'La noche de Iguala'. De acuerdo con el Gobierno de México, la decisión de hacer públicos los archivos obedece \"a los principios de verdad, memoria y justicia\". Tales documentos se pondrán a disposición de las madres y padres de los 43 normalistas de Ayotzinapa, quienes han exigido a las autoridades competentes que se entregue toda la información disponible en torno al caso. Estamos conscientes de que ustedes han manifestado la exigencia de que el gobierno entregue información que refieren “no se ha entregado”, así como de ampliar las búsquedas concernientes en diversos archivos, entre ellos, de la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional\", escribió Félix Medina Padilla, presidente de la Comisión para la Verdad y el Acceso a la Justicia del caso Ayotzinapa. A través de una misiva que se dio a conocer este viernes, Félix Medina Padilla, presidente de la Comisión para la Verdad y el Acceso a la Justicia del caso Ayotzinapa (CoVAJ), adelantó que entre la información que se dará a conocer a los padres figuran archivos de la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Sedena). Te podría interesar Medina Padilla agregó que, por instrucciones del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), se atenderá de manera inmediata la solicitud de las madres y padres de Ayotzinapa, quienes demandan acceso a mayor información que permita conocer más pormenores sobre la 'Noche de Iguala' y esclarecer el destino de los 43 normalistas. La CoVAJ determinó que la información se pondría a disposición de los familiares de los normalistas desaparecidos durante sesiones ocurridas el 24 de noviembre y el 15 de diciembre. Medina Padilla agregó que las madres y padres de familia no acudieron a ninguna de estas sesiones. ¿Cuál fue el último avance sobre el caso Ayotzinapa? El 26 de septiembre de 2023, la CoVAJ entregó los avances de la investigación en torno al caso de los 43 normalistas de Ayotzinapa, donde se sostuvieron versiones como: un militar, llamado Julio César López Patolzn, estuvo infiltrado entre los estudiantes de la normal rural Isidro Burgos, las víctimas fueron divididas y desaparecidas en al menos tres grupos durante la 'Noche de Iguala'. Entre las hipótesis que sostiene el informe en torno a la desaparición de los normalistas se encuentran: las víctimas fueron confundidas por el cártel de Guerreros Unidos; la presencia de armas, drogas, o dinero ilícito en los autobuses que fueron tomados por los estudiantes; así como una posible acción por parte de las autoridades de Iguala, al mando de José Luis Abarca, para dar un escarmiento a los normalistas. El presidente López Obrador, ese mismo 26 de septiembre, insistió en que la investigación del caso Ayotzinapa sigue abierta. En aquella ocasión, dijo que las madres y los padres de los normalistas se negaron a recibir el informe, debido a que solicitaron que se incorporaran los archivos bajo el resguardo de la Sedena.",

    "text": "(Teleborsa) - Con il decreto-legge 45 del 2025, di recente approvazione, sono state previste misure chiare e definiti controlli stringenti per il contrasto dei cosiddetti diplomifici. Al contempo, in accordo con gli Uffici Scolastici Regionali e in attuazione del Protocollo d’intesa firmato con la Guardia di Finanza , è stata messa in atto, nei mesi precedenti, un'estesa azione ispettiva che ha portato alla revoca della parità a un alto numero di Istituzioni scolastiche.\n\"La lotta contro i diplomifici sta iniziando a dare i suoi primi frutti concreti \", commenta il Ministro dell'Istruzione e del Merito, Giuseppe Valditara , \"il nostro impegno è per una scuola seria, contrassegnata dal merito e dalla legalità\".\nIn Sicilia, nei primi mesi del 2025, sono state 11 le revoche della parità fra le scuole di II grado, di cui 8 a seguito delle ispezioni avviate nell'anno scolastico 2024/2025. Sempre in Sicilia, altre 24 revoche sono avvenute nel corso del 2024. Sempre nel 2024, le revoche sono state 11 in Calabria e 30 in Campania.\nAlcuni segnali arrivano anche dagli esami di Stato. Guardando ai dati della Maturità 2025 emerge, con riferimento ai candidati esterni, una diminuzione che riguarda sia la scuola statale che la paritaria. In particolare, i candidati esterni totali quest’anno sono 13.066, rispetto ai 13.787 del 2024, con un calo del 5,2%. I candidati esterni sono il 6,9% in meno rispetto al 2024 nelle scuole statali e l’1,3% in meno nelle scuole paritarie.\nLa flessione degli esterni alla Maturità, fra scuole statali e paritarie, ha avuto un picco in alcune regioni, in particolare in quelle dove il controllo sui cosiddetti diplomifici ha portato a un numero consistente di revoche della parità. In Calabria i candidati esterni sono quest’anno il 30,9% in meno : passano dai 747 del 2024 ai 516 del 2025. In Campania gli esterni sono il 25% in meno: passano dai 1.685 del 2024 ai 1.264 del 2025. In Sicilia sono il 23,9% in meno: erano 1.613 nel 2024, sono 1.228 nel 2025.",
