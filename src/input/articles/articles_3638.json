    "title": "CT's stricter Medicaid limits could reduce coverage, advocates say",
    "text": "Beginning in October, Connecticut will enact a stricter income threshold for HUSKY A, the Medicaid coverage for parents and caretaker relatives of eligible children. Currently, parents and caretaker relatives who earn up to 160% of the federal poverty level, or FPL, qualify for HUSKY A. But a measure passed last session, which was introduced and backed by Gov. Ned Lamont, will reduce the eligibility threshold to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning Oct. 1, 2024. Roughly 15,300 people will lose HUSKY coverage, according to a [brief](https://www.cthealth.org/publication/husky-parents-cut/) released Thursday by the Connecticut Health Foundation. But most of those people will retain Medicaid coverage for another year under what’s known as [Transitional Medical Assistance](https://portal.ct.gov/husky/medical/husky-transitional-medical-assistance-tma). After that, most will qualify for a zero-premium, no cost-share coverage plan under [Covered Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/dss/health-and-home-care/covered-connecticut-program), a program that provides free health insurance to residents who earn less than 175% of the FPL through Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance marketplace. According to the Lamont administration, Connecticut is currently the only state providing Medicaid coverage to parents and relative caregivers over 138% of the FPL. Bringing the eligibility threshold in line with other states [will save](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2024/hsdata/TMY/2024HB-05053-R000305-Barton%20Reeves,%20Andrea,%20Commissioner-DSS--TMY.PDF) $2.1 million in FY 2025 and $33 million on an annualized basis afterward. “This benefits everyone by stretching limited state dollars while maintaining zero premium, no-cost health care through commercial insurance for HUSKY A adults,” said Chris Collibee, a spokesperson for the Office of Policy and Management, in emailed comments. Collibee said the policy “costs the taxpayers of Connecticut less than the costs under HUSKY A” and helps to strengthen Access Health CT. The program “covers out-of-pocket costs not covered by the federal government,” Collibee said, “while also providing coverage of dental and non-emergency medical transportation services.” “This costs the taxpayers of Connecticut less than the costs under HUSKY A because we are leveraging the federal subsidies already available under the exchange.” But advocates have concerns that the change will impact access to health care for some low-income residents. “Covered Connecticut is an excellent option for people whose incomes are just above the limit for Medicaid and have not had access to affordable coverage in the past,” said Tiffany Donelson, president and CEO of the Connecticut Health Foundation. “However, it is most effective as a way to increase coverage options for people, not a mechanism to roll back HUSKY.” A [policy brief](https://www.cthealth.org/publication/husky-parents-cut/) released today by the Connecticut Health Foundation states that while many of the parents and caregivers losing HUSKY coverage will qualify for Covered Connecticut, some won’t. Covered Connecticut is only available to people who do not have access to another source of insurance, like Medicare or employer-sponsored coverage. For example, some grandparents over the age of 65 who qualify for Medicare and serve as their grandchildren’s caretakers would not qualify for Covered Connecticut. Neither would someone whose employer offers health coverage, even if it’s a high-deductible plan. Under the Affordable Care Act, though, people with employer-sponsored insurance can still qualify for Covered Connecticut if the coverage is “unaffordable,” defined as having premium payments that make up more than 8.39% of their income. The brief also warns that the federal funding that supports Covered Connecticut is slated to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress and the president extend the funding. Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said he does not agree with the change. Even though Connecticut had a higher eligibility threshold than any other state, it’s good policy to cover parents and children together, he said. “It is very strange that we are kicking people off of Medicaid at a time of [budget surplus](https://ctmirror.org/2024/06/27/ct-budget-1-billion-surplus/),” said Lesser. Lamont [introduced](https://ctmirror.org/2024/02/07/ct-health-care-ned-lamont-budget/) the measure in his proposed budget last session, but it failed to pass as part of a bill in the Human Services Committee. Then, during budget negotiations, the governor successfully pushed to include the provision in the final ARPA package, Lesser said. The move is the latest in a series of decisions that has advocates of Medicaid expansion questioning Lamont’s commitment to the program. The governor has yet to back [increases to Medicaid reimbursement rates](https://ctmirror.org/2024/02/19/ct-medicaid-reimbursement-rate-study/), which have near-universal support from providers and legislators from both sides of the aisle. He also recently began [exploring the possibility of privatizing the state’s Medicaid](https://ctmirror.org/2024/07/25/ct-medicaid-costs-managed-care-model/) program amidst strong pushback from the Council on Medical Assistance Program Oversight. “I think the governor needs to figure out whether he cares about Medicaid,” said Lesser. “Medicaid costs a lot of money, and you can expand access or put money into rates, or both. But if you don’t do either, then the question is, are you serious about the program?” Collibee, the spokesperson for OPM, said the governor has worked with the legislature to fund Medicaid expansions, including $7 million to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates, new rates for Urgent Crisis Centers and $17 million in ARPA funding for children’s behavioral health. The administration also wants to ensure that rate increases are used effectively. “We continue to see significant growth in Medicaid costs, driven not only by higher enrollment/utilization but also legislative adds and program expansions. If rates are going to be increased, the taxpayers of Connecticut deserve to know that they are seeing an improvement in services, including access, and not just paying more for the same service,” said Collibee. The policy brief from the Connecticut Health Foundation recommends several specific strategies to ensure minimal loss of coverage during the HUSKY A transition, including identifying people who won’t be eligible for Covered Connecticut, using navigators to help people enroll in new coverage and making a plan for the potential expiration of federal subsidies. The Department of Social Services is working to prepare for the transition by collaborating with Access Health CT to track and support people who do not automatically get enrolled in Transitional Medical Assistance or Covered Connecticut, said DSS Deputy Commissioner Peter Hadler. And they’re making sure to get the message out about the change. DSS will notify people via mail and text message of changes and offer support in getting coverage. Both DSS and Access Health CT will also post information about the process on their websites and social media. “We share a common goal of ensuring that eligible individuals continue to have health coverage, whether it be through HUSKY, Covered CT, or a qualified health plan,” said Hadler in emailed comments.

    "text": "Articles and letters may be edited for the purposes of clarity and space.\nAttacks on Christians\nSince the end of the British colonial rule and the partitioning of India in 1947, Christians in India have undergone an escalating series of attacks encouraged by the growth and rise to power of Hindu nationalism. The predominate religion in India is Hinduism, followed by Islam and Christianity. In this country of over one billion people, there are substantial numbers of other religions like Jainism and Sikhism too.\nChristians represent only 2.5 per cent of the total population in India. However, attacks on Christians continue to take place in the country every now and then. The attacks are not limited to rural areas only but have occurred in other cities and states as well like Delhi, Mumbai, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka and Goa.\nThere are also reports appearing in newspapers and on some television channels that Christians keep converting Hindus and Muslims to Christianity by force. I would like to inform readers that these reports are totally untrue. We Christians do not change the religion of another person; we only change their lives. We also do not give money to Hindus and Muslims to change their religion. No Hindu or Muslim is forced or lured to come and pray in the church.\nThey go there out of their own free will because they find peace, serenity and solace there, and also miracles happening in their lives. If they change their religion, it is out of their own free will and not by force. The pastors of the New Life, Baptist and other Christian denomination churches only lay their hands on the person’s head and prays for his or her healing.\nJust because we Christians are peace-loving people and do not retaliate, it does not mean that the BJP, the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), the Bajrang Dal and the Shiv Sena can take an upper hand on us.\nJUBEL D’CRUZ\nMumbai, India\nMerry Christmas!\nChristmas, with its name originating from the mass of Jesus, stands as a universal symbol of peace and love. Celebrated around the world with unparalleled joy and happiness, it is a festival eagerly awaited by people from diverse cultures. The global anticipation for this famous festival builds up well in advance, with preparations commencing as early as November.\nOn the cherished day of December 25, Christians globally come together to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. The festive spirit permeates the air, transforming communities and homes into vibrant expressions of celebration. Streets sparkle with colourful lights, homes are adorned with festive decorations and Christmas trees become focal points of merriment.\nThe essence of Christmas extends beyond the material aspects of celebration; it embodies a deeper sense of unity, compassion and goodwill. Families, irrespective of cultural backgrounds, gather to partake in traditions that have been passed down through generations. It is a time for reflection, gratitude and an appreciation of the shared human experience.\nAs the world collectively embraces the Christmas season, the spirit of giving and kindness takes centre stage. Individuals exchange heartfelt greetings, gifts and acts of generosity, reinforcing the sense of community that defines this festive period. The significance of Christmas lies not only in the rituals but also in the connections forged and strengthened during this time.\nIn this season of blessings, my heartfelt wish is that your home be illuminated with the warmth of light and resounds with the joyous echoes of laughter. May the spirit of Christmas bring peace to your heart and create lasting memories with your family. As we exchange good wishes and celebrate together, let us embrace the true essence of Christmas – a celebration of love, hope and the enduring beauty of shared moments. Wishing you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas filled with profound joy, abundant blessings and the spirit of togetherness.\nIMRAN PATRAS\nBahawalpur",

    "text": "Dogecoin - Heightened bubble risk for Dogecoin, signaling caution ahead. - The price action of DOGE’s pump mirrors Bitcoin’s halving years. The short-term bubble risk for [Dogecoin [DOGE]]https://ambcrypto.com/category/dogecoin-news/ has escalated to a critical value of 2.84, indicating that the meme-based cryptocurrency may be nearing a potential price correction. Dogecoin was trading at $0.38, a slight decline from its recent high of $0.42. The indicator suggested traders should be wary of initiating long positions under current market conditions. The chart showed DOGE’s price in correlation with its bubble risk levels over the years, displaying significant peaks that historically precede market pullbacks. This pattern advised investors to approach Dogecoin with caution, as the market could be due for another downturn. Dogecoin’s historical surge patterns DOGE patterns of rallying post-[Bitcoin [BTC]]https://ambcrypto.com/category/bitcoin-news/ halving events, notably in 2016, 2020, and 2024 indicated each cycle presented a striking symmetry in Dogecoin’s price action. After the 2016 and 2020 Bitcoin halvings, DOGE experienced its first major price pump, followed by a period of consolidation, and then a second, more substantial pump. The 2024 cycle mirrored this pattern closely, suggesting that historical behaviors are repeating. The charts marked these phases clearly: the initial surge (first pump), followed by a stabilization period (pause), and then a secondary, stronger rally projected to peak by 2025. The current trajectory of Dogecoin suggested a potential climb to $20 by 2025, following its rise in the post-halving momentum this year. With DOGE’s short-term bubble risk at a high of $2.84, traders exhibited caution as it was trading at $0.38, Dogecoin has struggled to extend gains beyond $0.42. Technical analysis suggested a potential dip to $0.36 could serve as a critical juncture to accumulate liquidity needed to push prices higher. This setup aimed to retest recent highs, offering a pivotal moment for Dogecoin to overcome bearish pressures. Search trends signal rising interest Additionally, Dogecoin’s search trends in November have illustrated significant interest spikes, hinting at an upcoming surge in its market price. Analysis of the trend data revealed a peak in search activity around the 5th of November, coinciding with noticeable price movements. As interest waned, so did the price, showing a direct correlation between public interest and market behavior. These trends were essential indicators of how community engagement could potentially drive price changes. Read [Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction]https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/dogecoin-price-prediction 2024–2025 Historically, these trends have signaled upcoming market movements. This observation is crucial for those aiming to profit from Dogecoin’s volatility. This observed pattern supported the notion that heightened curiosity could soon translate into higher market activity for Dogecoin.",

    "text": "Friday may be a bit more on the cloudy side with a few rain or snow showers possible by the afternoon. The highs will be in the low 40s and that will mean snow is likely at elevation. The highs will be in the mid 40s, but it feels mostly like yesterday. The lows drop to the low 20s tonight as the cold air rushes back in. The rest of the weekend is going to get cold and messy. Temperatures could drop rather unpleasantly by the weekend with a dramatic fall below average in our highs and lows. The highs may be in the 30s Saturday with sunshine throughout the day with lows plunging well into the 20s. SEE ALSO: Weather Alert Day: Rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow ahead We are making Sunday and Monday Weather Alert Days due to a winter storm headed our way Sunday night and Monday morning. Right now plan for a wintry mix starting Sunday afternoon with mostly snow falling Sunday night and into Monday. It's too early for totals, but I think we should be seeing area wide snow with it sticking around for a little bit. Travel impacts should be expected late Sunday and early Monday with ice and snow mixing and freezing overnight. We'll likely see some spots at elevation getting a couple of inches of snow if the warmer air doesn't hit you. Mix storms like this one make it difficult to point to where the worst roads will be. Some spots will just have wet roads, while a few miles away could have ice-covered roads. Power outages could be possible thanks to freezing rain and ice forming on power lines. It looks like the ice is becoming our biggest weather concern with this system.

    "text": "Serbian Parliament approves new govt led by Djuro Macut\nBelgrade, April 17 (IANS) The National Assembly of Serbia has elected a new government led by endocrinologist Djuro Macut.\nA total of 153 members of Parliament voted on Wednesday in favour, 46 opposed, while 51 lawmakers were absent from the session.\nThe new Cabinet will comprise 31 members, Xinhua news agency reported.\nMacut presented his government's programme and cabinet lineup on Tuesday, the first day of the special session of the National Assembly, outlining the key priorities of his administration.\nMacut emphasised that his government would focus on domestic stabilisation and strategic foreign policy.\nIn response to ongoing youth-led protests and institutional disruptions, he pledged to uphold the rule of law and encourage open dialogue while safeguarding the rights of all citizens.\n\"Protests and expressions of discontent are natural for the youth,\" Macut said, \"but blockades and the denial of others' rights to work, study, or live normally are unacceptable.\"\nHe announced the formation of a Council for Youth and Talents, which he will personally oversee.\nThe council aims to nurture young talent and harness their potential for the country's development.\nOn international affairs, Macut reaffirmed Serbia's sovereign and balanced approach.\nWhile underscoring Serbia's commitment to the European Union (EU) accession process, he emphasised the country's independence in policymaking.\n\"Serbia does not approach the EU from a position of pleading, but from one of conviction. This relationship is a partnership founded on mutual respect, not asymmetry,\" he said.\nHe also stressed that domestic reforms are guided by national priorities rather than external demands.\n\"Our reforms are not a response to EU requirements. They are a response to the needs of our citizens,\" Macut added.\nHe also reaffirmed Serbia's dedication to broad international cooperation, saying that the country will \"extend hands of cooperation to all\".\nMacut also addressed the Kosovo issue, calling it the highest national priority.\n\"We do not abandon our principles, but we do not reject dialogue. Peace is impossible without justice,\" he asserted.\nMacut's nomination follows the resignation of former Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, who stepped down on January 28 amid mounting tensions following the deadly canopy collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in November 2024, which resulted in 16 fatalities.\nThe National Assembly officially confirmed Vucevic's resignation on March 19.\nDisclaimer: This story has not been edited by the Sakshi Post team and is auto-generated from syndicated feed.",

    "title": "Multidão celebra virada sem garoa na Paulista",
    "text": "São Paulo já comemora, em grande estilo e sem garoa, como estava previsto, a chegada de 2024. Com forte esquema de segurança, a Avenida Paulista, um dos principais cartões-postais da capital, está lotada na expectativa para a passagem de ano ao som de “Evidências”, sucesso de Chitãozinho & Xororó, que será cantado pela dupla na virada.\nAs comemorações começaram às 16h e vão se estender até a madrugada, quando o Baile do Simonal encerrará a festa. Zezé Di Camargo foi um dos primeiros a se apresentar, com as novidades de seu solo “Rústico”, cujo repertório traz músicas inéditas e regravações de hits que marcaram sua trajetória ao lado do irmão, Luciano.\nA DJ Cranmarry anima os intervalos dos shows com um repertório eclético — pagode, samba, pisero e outros gêneros. Ton Carfi e Paloma Possi, expoentes da música gospel, trouxeram um coral ao vivo e emocionaram o público com um espetáculo de louvor.\nÀs 23h, os irmãos Chitãozinho & Xororó assumirão o comando das festividades. A dupla entoará a esperada contagem regressiva à meia-noite, que será seguida por queima de fogos de dez minutos. A prefeitura optou por fogos com o menor estampido possível, \"com o objetivo de proteger animais e pessoas com hipersensibilidade auditiva\".\nO palco da virada, localizado entre as ruas Haddock Lobo e Bela Cintra, conta com cenografia especial inspirada em símbolos da cidade. A principal referência visual é a Estação da Luz, um dos marcos da capital, com mais de 120 anos de história. A Catedral da Sé e a Ponte Estaiada, outros cartões-postais, também foram referências visuais centrais para a cenografia.\nVieram para o réveillon da Paulista amigos, casais apaixonados e famílias com crianças. Raika completou um ano de idade há dois dias e veio passar sua primeira virada na Paulista ao lado da mãe, Erika Aparecida, de 23 anos, do pai, Jonathas Davi, de 21, e da avó, Adalisa Silva, de 39. Os quatro chegaram pouco antes das 18h, depois de passarem uma hora e meia no trem e metrô. Eles vieram do Jaraguá, na Zona Norte, onde o casal mora.\n— É nossa primeira vez na Paulista. Somos muito fãs do Zezé. Como estamos com a bebê, não vamos estender muito, mas já valeu demais vir até aqui — diz Erika, que segura a filha no colo enquanto canta os sucessos do cantor.\nDona Adalisa veio de Icó, no Ceará, para passar o ano-novo em família. E aproveitou para tirar da lista um sonho antigo: conhecer a Paulista.\n— Hoje consegui realizar meu desejo! E está tudo muito lindo aqui— disse.\nO técnico de enfermagem Elias de Andrade escolheu o réveillon para apresentar a icônica Avenida Paulista à namorada, Henriza Lopes, de 23, com quem está junto há dois meses. Ele mora em Guarulhos (SP) e ela em Taquaritinga (SP), a 340 quilômetros da capital paulista. Apaixonados por música eletrônica, eles esperavam ansiosos por cada apresentação da DJ Cranmarry, que toca nos intervalos dos shows. Elias conta que também curtiu, especialmente, a iluminação do palco, todo trabalhado em tons de azul, verde e rosa.\nO casal ambiciona \"tirar vários sonhos do papel\" em 2024. Henrinza, que é auxiliar de produção, quer comprar uma casa e vir morar com o namorado em São Paulo, onde, aposta, terá mais oportunidades de trabalho e estudo. Ele não se fez de rogado:\n— Falei para ela que ela vai casar comigo e nunca mais ficará solteira — brinca Elias.\nO entorno da Paulista estava cercado por policiais, guardas municipais e de trânsito. Todos que acessam a avenida passam, antes, por uma revista cautelosa, mas ágil. O acesso por determinadas ruas, porém, estava fechado, o que obrigou algumas pessoas a enfrentar uma caminhada maior antes de chegar à avenida. Foi o caso da administradora Jéssica Duarte, de 27 anos, que precisou andar, conta, por trinta minutos, até chegar à altura do Masp. Ela queria assistir ao show da cantora Claudia Leitte, a partir das 21h.\n— Sou de São Luís, moro em São Paulo há sete anos, mas sempre passei o réveillon trabalhando, é a primeira vez que pude vir à Paulista— conta a moradora da Bela Vista, na região Central.\nEla só torceu o nariz para a concentração de policias no entorno do evento, mas bem menos onde o público se concentra.\n— Aqui no meio da avenida, como não tem tanto policial, fico insegura de pegar o celular, por exemplo — diz, lembrando que o namorado foi assaltado na região na semana passada.\nEsquema de segurança\nUm dos mais tradicionais réveillons do país, esse ano a Paulista tem segurança reforçada, com 1,6 mil policiais militares nas ruas, drones e o helicóptero águia da corporação. Todos que entraram na avenida passaram por uma revista que não durou mais que 10 minutos. A prefeitura mobilizou 630 policiais com 46 viaturas do Comando de Policiamento de Área Metropolitano 1 (CPA/M), do Batalhão de Ações Especiais (Baep) e do policiamento motorizado da capital. Também fazem parte do efetivo 350 guardas municipais e cerca de 700 seguranças privados.\nO transporte público também tem esquema especial. As estações Paraíso, Brigadeiro e Trianon-Masp ficarão abertas para embarque e desembarque durante toda a madrugada. As demais estações do Metrô — das linhas 1-Azul, 2-Verde, 3-Vermelha e 15-Prata — permanecerão abertas para embarque e desembarque até as 2h da manhã. Depois deste horário, continuam funcionando na manhã desta segunda-feira, mas apenas para desembarque dos passageiros.\nEstação mais próxima do palco, a Consolação (Linha 2-Verde) foi fechada para embarque às 16h deste domingo e deve ser reaberta às 4h40 de segunda.\n[Mais recente](#) Próxima Congonhas: ar-condicionado apresenta falhas desde terça de manhã e passageiros reclamam do calor",

    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) – Germany’s lower house of parliament has passed legal amendments allowing apartment owners and tenants to install solar systems on their balconies, as the country seeks to increase uptake of the energy form.\nThe reforms, passed late on Thursday, allow what is referred to as a “privileged measure” in rental and property ownership law to allow plug-in solar devices, making it difficult for landlords and apartment-owner associations to block their installation without an exceptional justification.\n“The right to harvest solar power is thus legally enshrined. This is tangible climate protection and is likely to further increase acceptance of the energy transition,” Carsten Körnig, the head of the BSW solar power association, said in a statement.\nThe changes are likely to have a particular impact in a country where more than half of the population live in rented accommodation and to help the capital Berlin achieve its goal of covering 80% of energy needs from renewable energy by 2030.\nThey will apply to systems with a capacity of up to 2,000 watts that are frequently used to reduce households electricity bills, the economy ministry said, adding there would be no immediate need to change electricity meters.\nFollowing the energy price surge that followed Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the ending of Germany’s dependency on Russian gas, Germany has increasingly turned to renewables.\nDemand for balcony solar systems, which typically cost between 500 and 1,500 euros ($541.25 and $1,623.75), surged last year. Some 550,000 devices are in operation, half of which were installed in 2023, data from the BSW solar power association showed.\n($1 = 0.9238 euros)\n(Reporting by Riham Alkousaa; editing by Barbara Lewis)",
