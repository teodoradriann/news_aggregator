    "text": "[China issues special stamps marking Year of the Dragon](https://english.cctv.cn/2024/01/08/VIDEQOyrTlXWXdgQkH2hNxNm240108.shtml) BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council have issued guidelines to comprehensively promote the development of a \"Beautiful China.\" This development must be given prominence in the construction of a strong country and in the process of achieving national rejuvenation, according to the guidelines. By 2027, China will have seen a continuous decrease in the total discharge of major pollutants and improve the quality of its ecological environment. By 2035, green methods of production and ways of life will have been developed broadly, carbon emissions will have peaked and be in steady decline, and the country's ecological environment will have improved fundamentally. Looking ahead to the middle of the century, China's ecological civilization will have improved comprehensively, its green development and lifestyles will have taken full shape, and the deep decarbonization of its key areas will have been realized, according to the guidelines. The country's ecological environment will also be healthy and beautiful by that time, its ecological and environmental governance system and capacity will be fully modernized, and a \"Beautiful China\" will have been built in all respects. The guidelines urged efforts to strengthen law enforcement oversight, protection, and restoration and strive to keep the national ecological protection red line area above 3.15 million square kilometers. Work should be done to strive to realize a carbon peak by 2030 and lay a foundation for working hard to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. The guidelines noted that by 2027, the proportion of new energy vehicles among all new automobiles should reach 45 percent. Old diesel locomotives will be eliminated, and the combined transport volume of port containers by railway and waterway will maintain rapid growth. By 2035, the proportion of railway freight turnover aimed to reach about 25 percent, while the efficiency of energy and water resources utilization was targeted to reach an advanced level globally, it said. The guidelines also aimed to deepen pollution governance, accelerating the construction of zero-waste cities, deepening the complete ban on the entry of imported waste, and strictly preventing all forms of smuggling and disguised import of solid waste. By 2035, China will achieve full coverage of zero-waste city construction, the eastern provinces will take the lead in finishing the construction of zero-waste cities, and the environmental risks of new pollutants will be effectively controlled. To enhance the diversity, stability, and sustainability of the ecosystem, the guidelines aimed that the national forest coverage will increase to 26 percent and the soil and water conservation rate will climb to 75 percent by 2035, achieving a virtuous cycle of ecosystems. Policy support will also enhance, the guidelines said.",

    "title": "Old Man Trump Cites Made-Up Polls to Excuse Low-Energy Campaign",
    "text": "Old Man Trump Cites Made-Up Polls to Excuse Low-Energy Campaign\nDonald Trump keeps insisting he’s polling better than Kamala Harris.\nDonald Trump tried Thursday to explain away his apparent staycation amid a tightening presidential race, but unfortunately for the former president, his numbers just didn’t add up.\nEver since Trump’s rally in Atlanta this past weekend, the former president has been lying low at home. Meanwhile, his running mate, J.D. Vance, has seemingly been\nsent to follow Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz across the country, to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\nDuring a press conference from the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, Trump was asked about his apparent pause in public appearances. He didn’t take it well.\n“You have not had a public campaign event for nearly a week now; tomorrow you’ll be in Montana, which is not a swing state,” said one reporter. “Some of your allies have expressed concern that you’re not taking this race seriously, particularly—”\n“What a stupid question,” Trump\ninterjected.\n“At a time where there is enthusiasm on the other side. Why haven’t you been campaigning this week?” the reporter asked.\n“Uh, because I’m leading by a lot and because I’m letting their convention go through,” Trump said, implying he had taken a step back before immediately contradicting himself. “And I am campaigning a lot.”\nTrump then claimed that he’d kept busy working on “commercials that are at a level that anybody’s ever done before.”\nThe Republican nominee also said that he’d been doing remote interviews.\n“I’m speaking to you on phones, I’m speaking to radio, I’m speaking to television. Uh, television is coming over here,” Trump said. “Excuse me, what are we doing right now?”\nEarlier this week, Trump called in to Fox & Friends to push the\nbaseless claim that Harris had picked Walz out of antisemitism against another contender, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, but he couldn’t get through it without reviving his own offensive comments about Jewish voters.\nTrump then criticized Harris for not speaking more with the press. “She’s not doing any news conferences. You know why she’s not doing [them]? She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference,” Trump said Thursday.\nThis claim seems to be a new line of attack for Trump and Vance, who made a comment about it Wednesday on the tarmac in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\nSomeone close to Harris’s campaign told\nPolitico that there was little “incentive” for Harris to speak more with the press. “She’s getting out exactly the message she wants to get out,” they said.\nAs for Trump’s claim that he’s “leading by a lot,” that’s not necessarily clear.\nWhen listing recent polls that had him ahead, Trump cited a recent\nRasmussen Reports survey published Thursday, which found that Trump was leading 49 percent to 44 percent. Rasmussen was recently dropped from the national poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight, after it was determined to be too right-leaning to be considered reliable.\nTrump cited a\nCNBC poll published Thursday that found the former president to have a two-point lead over his opponent. He also mentioned an MSNBC poll that placed him ahead, but such a poll did not appear to exist.\nWhile Trump claimed he’d taken the lead in swing states, an\nIpsos poll published Thursday found that the two candidates were neck and neck, with Harris taking a slight lead. On Wednesday, two key national poll aggregators found that after months of struggling, the Democratic Party’s candidate had overtaken Trump in the polls.\nTrump is well aware that he’s beginning to struggle in the polls—apparently, it’s\ndriving him nuts.",

    "text": "‘Something is being done’: City receives extra $1M as they work to cleanup the old Loris High School property LORIS, S.C. (WMBF) - The City of Loris is joining forces with the state, as they work to transform a long-standing eyesore, the old Loris High School property. In June leaders received approval for an additional $1 million from state legislators. This comes after Loris received $1 million [earlier this year, to help purchase the property](https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/01/16/loris-receives-1m-state-help-purchase-old-loris-high-school-property/). The school was built in 1930 and closed in 1988 when the new Loris High School was completed. The school then reopened when a primary school was being constructed, but closed for good in 1996. “It’s heartbreaking. It’s just a shame,” said a neighbor to old school grounds, Betty Carter. On Thursday, Carter reflected on the site she’s watched decay, just yards from her home. “What can you do when it’s gone so far,” said Carter. Carter said it’s difficult to look at the abandoned site each day because, for her, it’s personal. “I went to high school right over there. Graduated there in 1960. My husband graduated in 61 from there,” said Carter. Inside the rundown buildings, halls that once held students full of life, now sit filled with moldy books and broken glass. Carter said over the years, the school has also attracted a slew of folks up to no good. “Since nobody was using it, people just started breaking in,” said Carter. However, this situation could all soon be changing. Along with the city’s $1 million funding, they also received a grant application from the former Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). The application will allow DHEC to asses the old grounds for contaminants. The city said the assessment could take several months to complete. After DHEC assesses the property, the city said folks will then start to see real change in the area. “Within the next six months to a year, you could actually see some of the buildings being taken down, some of the site being cleaned up,” said City of Loris City Administrator, William Young. While those with ties to the school reflect, many are also looking forward to the next chapter for the grounds. “I’m glad something is being done. I’d rather it be a park or something like that,” said Carter. The city has been approved for their funds, but they will get the $1 million in their pocket by the fall.

Al encontrarse junto al establecimiento, inicia a encender la mecha del artefacto y cuando parece que lo logrÃ³, se da un fuerte estallido. Una nube de humo aparece, mientras un tenis sale volando. Ante lo ocurrido, el cÃ³mplice del sujeto pisa el acelerador del automÃ³vil y huye del lugar. Un menor de edad, vÃctima de la explosiÃ³n Medios internacionales informaron que los hechos ocurrieron el miÃ©rcoles 27 de diciembre a las 22:49 horas, en un negocio ubicado en la avenida Francisco de Orellana, en Guayaquil, [Ecuador](https://www.unotv.com/internacional/exvicepresidente-de-ecuador-jorge-glas-pide-asilo-a-mexico/). En declaraciones a medios, VÃctor Herrera, comandante de la Zona 8 de la PolicÃa Nacional, confirmÃ³ la muerte de una persona debido al incidente. DetallÃ³ que el explosivo es de uso industrial y la persona propietaria del negocio ya habÃa reportado llamadas de extorsiÃ³n en dÃas previos. â€œSe logrÃ³ determinar que el explosivo utilizado era de uso industrial, cuya envoltura es de color rojo. El efecto que tuvo sobre esta persona que intentÃ³ detonar afuera de una unidad econÃ³mica lamentablemente causÃ³ la muerte de esta persona con el desmembramiento de las extremidades superiores y la pierna izquierdaâ€�.VÃctor Herrera, comandante de la Zona 8 de la PolicÃa Nacional. AgregÃ³ que, de acuerdo con credenciales encontradas cerca de los restos, se tratarÃa de un menor de edad quien intentÃ³ colocar [el artefacto explosivo](https://www.unotv.com/internacional/avion-aterriza-en-paris-por-presunta-presencia-de-artefacto-explosivo/) y muriÃ³ en el lugar. â€œEste evento, de acuerdo con la lÃnea investigativa post-explosiÃ³n, hemos podido determinar que uno de los propietarios de esa unidad econÃ³mica habÃa llamadas extorsivas. Esta persona que intentÃ³ encender y activar la explosiÃ³n es una persona, estarÃamos hablando de acuerdo a una de las credenciales de identificaciÃ³n que se encontrÃ³ cerca del occiso, se entenderÃa y se tratarÃa de un menor de edad, eso posterior ya a las pericias tÃ©cnicas en criminalÃsticaâ€�.

    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",
