    "text": "Influencer Alisha Marie warns on TikTok about using glamorous makeup in passport photos. (Illustrative Image Infobae)\nPassport photos are glamorous – some might say aspirational – and created with a multi-step, multi-product process. could be a warning .\n“This is The reason why you should never take attractive photos for your passport “, warned the influencer Alisha Marie in a TikTok goes viral last year, dressed in a black hoodie and baseball cap, her face bare of heavy makeup. She said she was almost stopped from boarding a flight because she didn’t look like her sleek, fully made-up passport photo.\n“I have never been SO HUMILIATED IN MY LIFE “, wrote.\nIn the social networks Makeup fans in several countries have lamented unrecognizable photos on their travel documents, after officials noticed they looked different in real life, failed facial scans or felt fatigued by false eyelashes.\n“ Why I regret putting on makeup for my passport ”, says the caption on one video. Another TikTok It begins with a woman discussing her biggest regret: “ My passport photo ”.\nIn some cases, the photos were inspired by a trend makeup which went viral two years ago and involved concealer, contour, heavily lined lips, a “fox eye” look and brows shaped with styling glue. Kim Kardashian She also made headlines when she shared her doctored passport photo on Instagram 10 years ago.\nRegardless of inspiration, the experts They say travelers should be cautious with makeup – or risk facing problems at the border or delays at the airport. .\nTravelers are complaining on social media about their doctored passport photos that made it difficult to identify them. (Illustrative Image Infobae)\nThe use of make-up is allowed for passport photos, he said. State Department In a statement to The Washington Post, “However, if you plan to wear makeup in your passport photo, we encourage you to stick to a makeup style that is consistent with your regular makeup style.”\nPassport photos must be an “accurate likeness” of the traveler, according to federal regulations and the International Civil Aviation Organization The rules for passports, which tend to be stricter than those for driver’s licenses, require a neutral expression, a clear, unfiltered image and a white or slightly off-white background.\nHe State Department said he had “seen reports of travelers experiencing delays due to the border control agents had difficulty confirming their identity” and encouraged people to avoid makeup styles that “significantly alter” the way their faces look. Entry into other countries can be delayed, he said, if officials are not sure the photo represents the traveler in front of them.\n“ It is important to facilitate travel and ensure safety measures “so that border control officers can easily recognize the person in the passport photo,” the State Department wrote. “If you do not typically wear makeup while traveling, you might consider not wearing makeup in your passport photo – or sticking to a very natural makeup look.”\nExperts recommend avoiding makeup that significantly alters the appearance in passport photos. (Illustrative Image Infobae)\nDenise Ambrusko-Maida which owns the Travel Brilliant travel agency reacted to the trend in her own video TikTok with a “reminder of DON’T do attractive makeup for your passport photos ”.\n“I take my passport photo to look like a swamp rodent on purpose,” she said. In an interview, Ambrusko-Maida said she was surprised that the glamour type photos are approved. His advice is to think about how you would look “ after being on a 15 hour flight overnight in a middle seat” and take a photo that looks like that situation.\n“If you’re the type of person who’s going to put on full makeup for that flight, fine – I love that for you. I’m not trying to tell you not to do it,” she said. Ambrusco-Maida who is based in Buffalo “Having flown around the world enough times, I know that won’t be most people’s choice.”\nSeveral people commented on her video to share their own personal passport aesthetics, including “sick,” “like a fugitive on the run,” “ghost,” and “seriously the worst thing I’ve ever done.”\nPassport photos must be an “accurate likeness” of the traveler, according to federal regulations. (Illustrative Image Infobae)\nThe online travel agency based in the UK, Travel Republic warned about the makeup trend earlier this month, noting that a “photo enhancement” could cause mishaps at the airport.\n“Most people are embarrassed by their ID images, however, they are a security measure to help prevent fraud, keep borders secure and ensure easy recognition of travelers’ identities,” he said. Gemma Brown the company’s product manager, in a press release. “So if you enhance your appearance too much when taking the photo, you can actually slow down the process of checking in at the airport because you look very different in person than the photo you have.”\nErik Learned-Miller professor at the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences in the University of Massachusetts at Amherst he wrote in an email to The Post that the impact of makeup on the security line depends on the type of system facial recognition in question.\nBut she said there are two “equally problematic” scenarios for facial recognition technology: a person who doesn’t wear makeup and has a passport photo with a lot of makeup on, or someone wearing makeup at the airport with a photo without makeup.\n“So the problem isn’t exactly having makeup in your passport photo,” Learned-Miller wrote. “It’s really having a different appearance in two different photos. It can go both ways.”\nState Department suggests natural makeup for passport photos. (Illustrative Image Infobae).\nThe interior designer and illustrator Phoebe Kut based in Vancouver she wasn’t even following a trend when she took her passport photo this summer – she was simply following her regular makeup routine.\nStill, he said in a video on TikTok her photo was rejected because her lips were too shiny .\n“ I really liked that photo of myself “, said Kut in an interview. She had taken the photo a month in advance, she said, and was not wearing makeup when she went to the passport office. She had to rush to get a new photo after the gloss-related rejection.\n“I didn’t get the same photo, but that’s okay, whatever,” Kut said.\nBruce Hallstrom owner of the international passport photo service Passport Photo Now said that makeup has been “a problem forever,” not just in the age of social media influencers. TikTok He tells clients when a photo they send him is likely to be rejected for too much makeup, use of a skin-enhancing filter or other reasons.\n“ I know there’s a blemish on your face somewhere “I know there are wrinkles somewhere,” he said.\nHer company, which verifies that photos comply with country rules and prints them, lists tips and warnings about makeup and says “this is not the time to be creative or try out that new electric green eyeshadow.”\n“The more you look like your photo,” says the final tip, “the less problems you will have.”\n(c) 2024 , The Washington Post",

    "title": "Dak Prescott opens up on reality he may leave Dallas Cowboys one day",
    "text": "Dak Prescott has given the Dallas Cowboys organization everything he has yet they continue to string him along when it comes to contract negotiations. Jerry Jones and his son, Stephen Jones, used the franchise tag on Prescott twice before signing him to a four-year, $160 million extension in 2021. As he enters the final year of that deal, the front office is once again taking their time in negotiations . On Thursday, Dak and Jerry Jones spoke on the situation and each made it clear that they want to get something done. Jones said he doesn't believe this will be Prescott's final year with the Cowboys and the quarterback made it clear he doesn't want to leave either. However, he added that it could be a reality for him since \"it's a two-way street.\" Prescott alluded to other franchise quarterbacks who have left in free agency which includes Peyton Manning and Tom Brady — who each won a Super Bowl with their second franchise. Before diving into that, however, Prescott had to pause and compose himself. He said Dallas is where he grew up and became a man, making it hard to dispute his desire to remain with the only pro franchise he's ever played for. Reports suggest Prescott could be the first player to land a deal worth $60 million. If the Cowboys do fumble the ball and let him hit the open market in 2025, he could wind up landing even more than that. --Enjoy More Cowboys News from Cowboys on SI-- Send Help: Ranking Dallas' weapons without CeeDee Lamb entering camp Football Fun: Best Cowboys-themed fantasy football team names for 2024 Costly Choice: How much could CeeDee Lamb's holdout cost Dallas Cowboys star?

Dabei können Freunde dabei helfen, Krisen zu bewältigen – und über heikle Dinge wie Hygiene und Prostatavorsorge zu reden.\nIrgendwann, vor Jahren, sagte mein bester Freund zu mir: „Nur Idioten gehen nicht zum Arzt.“ Wir müssen Anfang 20 gewesen sein, damals, es war also kurz nach dem Verlassen der familiären Einflusszone, in der noch Erziehungsberechtigte darauf achten, dass man sich regelmäßig die Zähne untersuchen lässt. Ich weiß nicht, woher mein Freund diese Weisheit hatte, aber Männergesundheit bleibt auch dreißig Jahre später ein großes Thema, allem sozialen Wandel zum Trotz. Ein Thema, fast so groß wie die Männerfreundschaft, über die aber schon seit Jahrtausenden Geschichten erzählt werden, die zum Mythos geworden ist: zwei Männer, die sich kennenlernen und sich ihr Leben lang die Treue halten, auch wenn die auf die Probe gestellt wird.",

    "title": "Украинские СМИ: ВС РФ атаковали Киев неизвестным ранее реактивным дроном-камикадзе",
    "text": "В ходе атаки на Киев российские войска впервые использовали ранее неизвестный дрон-камикадзе с реактивным двигателем, пишут украинские СМИ со ссылкой на опубликованные в сети фотографии обломков аппарата. В материале говорится, что при осмотре уцелевших фрагментов выяснилось, что конструкция беспилотника визуально отличается от иранского Shahed-238, который «уже применялся против Украины». Однако носовая часть напоминает усиленную версию аналогичного узла стандартного «Шахеда». Из-за серьезных повреждений точно идентифицировать модель пока невозможно. На этом фоне предполагается, что вышеупомянутый аппарат может быть российской разработкой на базе вышеупомянутого дрона – вероятно, БПЛА «Герань-3», о котором впервые сообщалось в феврале 2025 года. Авторы статьи напоминают, что Тегеран официально представил Shahed-238 в ноябре 2023 года на выставке Университета аэрокосмических наук и технологий «Ашура». Согласно озвученным данным, дрон оснащен двигателем TEM Tolue-10 – иранской копией чешского турбореактивного PBS TJ100. Максимальная скорость этого БПЛА, предположительно, достигает 800 км/ч, однако официального подтверждения этим данным нет. В свою очередь, эксперты не исключают, что при локализации производства Россия модифицировала конструкцию и установила другой двигатель, как это уже делалось с предыдущими версиями «Герани». Согласно имеющейся в открытом доступе информации, «Герань-3» имеет длину 3,5 метра, размах крыльев – 3 метра, а максимальная высота полета составляет 9,1 км. Длительность работы дрона оценивается в два часа, а взлетная масса увеличилась до 380 кг против 250 кг у предыдущей модели.",

    "text": "Il 6 giugno 1453 a Torino avvenne il Miracolo Eucaristico. Sul luogo fu eretta in seguito una chiesa, poi divenuta basilica del Corpus Domini. Ogni anno l’arcidiocesi di Torino rinnova questa memoria con la celebrazione eucaristica e la processione del Corpus Domini, festività religiosa in onore dell’Eucaristia, sviluppatasi nel XIII secolo ed estesa dal papa Urbano IV, nel 1264, a tutta la cattolicità.\nAnche a Bra la ricorrenza è molto sentita e, nella serata di giovedì 6 giugno, prenderà il via una solenne processione, in cui il “Corpo di Cristo”, sotto il segno sacramentale del Pane, passerà tra la popolazione esposto in un “ostensorio”.\nIl corteo, guidato dal clero locale, raggiungerà il monastero delle Sorelle Clarisse, dopo la celebrazione della Santa Messa in programma alle ore 20.30, presso il Santuario della Madonna dei Fiori.\nAl termine della processione verrà impartita la solenne benedizione. Seguirà l’adorazione eucaristica fino alle ore 23.\nAll’appuntamento sono invitati in modo particolare tutti i ministri straordinari della Comunione, quale testimonianza del profondo legame tra il ministero svolto e l’Eucaristia.\nSaranno presenti le autorità cittadine, le comunità parrocchiali, le cantorie, le associazioni di volontariato e le Confraternite religiose, i fanciulli che hanno ricevuto la Prima Comunione per essere davvero attorno al Pane di Vita, un cuor solo e un’anima sola.\nPerché si celebra il Corpus Domini\nIl Corpus Domini (Corpo del Signore) è sicuramente una delle solennità più sentite a livello popolare. Vuoi per il suo significato, che richiama la presenza reale di Cristo nell’Eucaristia, vuoi per lo stile della celebrazione. Pressoché in tutte le diocesi infatti, si accompagna a processioni, rappresentazione visiva di Gesù che percorre le strade dell’uomo.\nLa storia delle origini ci porta nel XIII secolo, in Belgio, per la precisione a Liegi. Qui il vescovo assecondò la richiesta di una religiosa che voleva celebrare il Sacramento del Corpo e Sangue di Cristo al di fuori della Settimana Santa. Più precisamente le radici della festa vanno ricercate nella Gallia belga e nelle rivelazioni della beata Giuliana di Retìne. Quest’ultima, priora nel Monastero di Monte Cornelio presso Liegi, nel 1208 ebbe una visione mistica in cui una candida Luna si presentava in ombra da un lato.\nUn’immagine che rappresentava la Chiesa del suo tempo, che ancora mancava di una solennità in onore del Santissimo Sacramento. Fu così che il direttore spirituale della beata, il canonico Giovanni di Lausanne, supportato dal giudizio positivo di numerosi teologi, presentò al vescovo Roberto di Thourotte la richiesta di introdurre una festa in onore del Corpus Domini.\nIl via libera arrivò nel 1246 con la data della festa fissata per il giovedì dopo l’ottava della Trinità. L’estensione della solennità a tutta la Chiesa però va fatta risalire a papa Urbano IV (che tempo prima aveva anche riconosciuto il miracolo eucaristico di Bolsena) con la bolla Transiturus de hoc mundo dell’11 agosto 1264.\nNell’estendere la solennità a tutta la Chiesa cattolica, il Papa scelse come collocazione il giovedì successivo alla prima domenica dopo Pentecoste (60 giorni dopo Pasqua). L’inno principale del Corpus Domini, cantato nella processione e nei Vespri, è il Pange lingua, scritto e pensato dal teologo domenicano Tommaso d’Aquino. In numerosi Paesi, tra cui dal 1977 l’Italia, la celebrazione è stata tuttavia spostata alla domenica successiva. In molte chiese locali però la data è rimasta il giovedì.",

    "title": "A Limoges, Michel Barnier presenta il piano d'emergenza del governo per proteggere l'industria francese",
    "text": "Michelin, ArcelorMittal, Vencorex, Valeo… non passa settimana senza nuovi licenziamenti nell'industria francese. In viaggio venerdì 29 novembre al produttore di attrezzature Texelis, vicino a Limoges (Haute-Vienne), il primo ministro Michel Barnier ha cercato di rispondere alla crisi presentando il piano del governo “reindustrializzare la Francia”.\nL'esecutivo si rivolge specificamente ai tre settori automobilistico, siderurgico e chimico, proponendo misure ad altri paesi dell'Unione Europea (UE) per far fronte alla concorrenza straniera, in particolare cinese.\nPer aiutare il settore della chimica, Parigi vuole avere il “carattere strategico” di quindici molecole “essenziali per le catene del valore” Le imprese industriali europee per tutelarle, sul modello del piano sui metalli critici votato dall'Ue a maggio. Per l’industria siderurgica, l’Unione deve aumentare, secondo la Francia, le tasse doganali contro l’acciaio cinese e rivedere le quote di importazione decise nel 2018.\nSostenere le imprese in difficoltà\nPer quanto riguarda l'automobile, oltre a un fondo di emergenza di 250 milioni di euro per aiutare il settore in Francia, il governo continua a chiedere a Bruxelles di eliminare le multe previste per il 2025 per i produttori che non avranno ridotto le loro emissioni di carbonio del 15%. Michel Barnier, che potrebbe lasciare Matignon nelle prossime settimane in caso di voto di censura contro la sua legge finanziaria per il 2025, inserisce le proposte francesi all'Ue in un calendario di appuntamenti “100 giorni”.\nLeggi anche | Articolo riservato ai nostri abbonati Il progetto di bilancio 2025 suscita preoccupazione nell’industria francese\nLeggi più tardi\nA livello nazionale, il Primo Ministro ha confermato venerdì la creazione di un «task force» comitato interministeriale a sostegno delle imprese in difficoltà, e lo sblocco di 1,55 miliardi di euro per finanziare la decarbonizzazione dei cinquanta siti industriali che emettono più gas serra.\nFare “di più e meglio in termini di semplificazione”\nMichel Barnier vuole soprattutto rilanciare l'installazione di progetti industriali nella regione, mentre i risultati positivi dal 2020 in termini di creazione di posti di lavoro e di fabbriche sono minacciati dall'aumento record di fallimenti dall'inizio dell'anno. Al fine di accelerare e semplificare ulteriormente gli impianti industriali nel Paese, ha annunciato quindi il capo del governo “esonerare” tutti i progetti industriali del sistema “artificializzazione netta zero” (ZAN) solo, “per un periodo di cinque anni”.\nTi resta il 34,39% di questo articolo da leggere.
