    "text": "Love and lyrics: Oklahoma couple's rap vows go viral\nAn Oklahoma couple made headlines by reciting their wedding vows through rap, showcasing their unique bond as hip-hop artists.\nAaron and Mariah Sawyer decided to break tradition during their September wedding, held in their front yard, by surprising their 100 guests with a rap performance after reading their paper vows.\n\"She goes, 'Oh my God, oh my God, we should rap our wedding vows,'\" Aaron told Tulsa-area television station Fox 23.\nThe couple's vows quickly went viral, amassing over 10 million views on TikTok and Instagram. However, the response was mixed, with many comments turning negative.\nDespite the backlash, Mariah said, \"Even though people were hating on our wedding vows, we were still living our dreams as hip-hop artists. It fueled that fire, that passion, that drive to continue being our authentic selves.\"\nAaron added, \"It's a testament to how solid our love and relationship is because a lot of people can put a lot of stress on the relationship with negative comments.\"\nBoth Aaron and Mariah have faced criticism in their music careers before, with Mariah even deleting Instagram at times to avoid negativity.\nThe couple remains grateful for the attention, as it helps them gain recognition in the hip-hop scene. They plan to track and release their wedding vows as a song in the future.",

    "text": "Prof who denies Hamas raped Israelis NOT selected for top DEI role\nMinnesota Professor Sima Shakhsari made her claims during the interview for an associate dean position at the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\nAccording to the Jewish Insider’s reporting, Shakhsari has been seen at rallies on campus chanting 'Globalize the Intifada.'\nA University of Minnesota professor who denied that Hamas committed rape against Israeli women during the Oct. 7 attacks has ultimately not received a leading administrative DEI position.\nSima Shakhsari made the comments before a panel during the interview process for an associate dean position at the College of Liberal Arts’ Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Shakhsari is an associate professor in the Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies department. [[RELATED: Students at elite universities call for ‘intifada revolution’]]https://www.campusreform.org/article/students-at-elite-universities-call-for-intifada-revolution-/24349\n“Of course, any person who has been raped, I am a rape crisis counselor, I believe the survivors,” Shakhsari said to the panel, according to\nJewish Insider. “I am yet to see Israeli rape survivors of Hamas come and speak.”\nAccording to investigators, Hamas committed “widespread”\nsexual crimes during its recent massacre of Israelis.\nA video recording of Shakhsari’s remarks before the panel has since been\nremoved from the university’s website.\nIn an email to Campus Reform, Andria Waclawski, director of public relations at Minnesota, said that\nAmelious Whyte has received the position; He will take over the role starting on Jan. 11.\nIn the interview process, Shakhsari also suggested that the accusations that Hamas committed rape are similar to lynchings of black men in the United States because they were accused of raping white women. “We know the history of lynching, of black man, lynching, of indigenous man lynching Latinos in this country… because of accusations and they’re kind of violating the innocence of white women, right?,” she said.\n“And I think that is also this force that is repeated in the context of Israel and Palestine, because Arab men have been demonized and have been marked as monstrous people who are rapists and for violence,” she continued.\n[[RELATED: Harvard students call to ‘globalize the intifada’ during anti-Israel ‘week of action’]]https://www.campusreform.org/article/harvard-students-call-to-globalize-the-intifada-during-anti-israel-week-of-action/24431\nAccording to the Jewish Insider’s reporting, Shakhsari has been seen at rallies on campus chanting “Globalize the Intifada.” The Arabic word “intifada” means “uprising,” often used in reference to a violent uprising against Israel.\nDuring the panel meeting, Shakhsari used the word “genocide” to describe Israel’s actions. “I cannot be silenced in the face of this genocide, and I’m not gonna argue whether it’s a genocide or not,” she said.\nIn an automatic email response to Campus Reform’s request for comment, Shakhsari wrote that she stands “with the people of Palestine in their struggle for freedom and justice” and condemns “the Israeli state’s settler colonial violence and genocide in Gaza.”\nCampus Reform also contacted the university for comment.

    "title": "Disaster survivors bring pleas for climate change action to Parliament Hill",
    "text": "OTTAWA — Meghan Fandrich's voice shook as she recalled grabbing her five-year-old daughter and fleeing their home as flames descended on the village of Lytton, B.C., in 2021. Darryl Tedjuk was quiet as he related the reality that his hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk in Northwest Territories was slowly being washed away by the Beaufort Sea. The two are among a growing class of Canadians for whom climate change is not an abstract concept but a lived reality. They brought their stories to Parliament Hill on Thursday, hoping to convince parliamentarians of the need to take greenhouse-gas emissions more seriously. Their pleas came the day after scientists at Copernicus, the European Union's earth monitoring arm, reported that last month was the warmest May ever on record globally, and the 12th straight month in which average temperatures broke previous records. The 2015 Paris climate accord, which almost every country in the world agreed to, commited signatories to reduce emissions in an effort to slow global warming and keep average temperatures from increasing more than 1.5 C above pre-industrial temperatures. In May, the average global temperature was already there, exceeding pre-industrial averages by 1.52 C. Global warming is contributing to an increase in the frequency and severity of bad weather. That includes heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and thunderstorms, which in turn have led to more damaging and recurring wildfires and floods. Alex Cool-Fergus, the national policy manager at Climate Action Network Canada, helped co-ordinate a visit to Ottawa by people across the country who have lived the reality of climate change. Fandrich said before her village burned, she saw disaster stories in the news and thought people would be fine, because \"they'll rebuild.\" Having lived through it herself, she said she now understands that surviving a disaster is not remotely that simple. She wants politicians to try to understand what it is really like. \"I don't expect that the policy-makers have thought about it, except they need to,\" said Fandrich. \"Except that it's their job to connect with Canadians. It's their job to represent us.\" Fandrich is a single mom who recalled in detail how she and her daughter had to flee on June 30, 2021, as a wildfire descended on Lytton, a tiny village of about 250 people that is 250 km northeast of Vancouver. She said most people can picture the fire itself, and people running. \"You can imagine watching your town turn into a pillar of smoke that's big enough to be seen from space,\" she said. \"You can imagine seeing that pillar and the black punctuations of smoke that come up as another car explodes, another propane tank, another house.\" But what most people don't imagine is what happens after the fire, she said. \"We went back to a burned-up town.\" The town, just seven blocks long, was 90 per cent destroyed. Fandrich was among the few who did not lose her home. Nearly three years later, she said only two or three homes are now in the midst of being rebuilt. The two grocery stores that existed are no more. She has to drive nearly an hour to buy food. Since the fire, Lytton has been hit with flooding and major snowstorms that added to the anxiety and made recovery even harder. For his part, Tedjuk has been working on a documentary about the impact climate change is having on Tuktoyaktuk, an Inuvialuit hamlet of about 900 people 1,400 km north of Whitehorse. Residents have spent years watching their beaches erode, and the water around the community get higher and higher. Homes that used to be one to two kilometres away from the water are now right beside it. A main island that protects the harbour from the worst of the sea's force is expected to disappear in 10 to 15 years, exposing the main hamlet to more damage. Tedjuk said scientists have told him the hamlet will disappear into the sea in 50 years if nothing is done to protect it. \"Everyone is worried about their home washing away into the ocean,\" he said. Tedjuk said he's trying to tell the story of Tuktoyaktuk to anyone who will listen, adding it's terrifying watching the community he loves slowly disappear. \"I love that community,\" he said. \"I want to try to help out as much as I can before it washes away.\" It has been less than a year since Heather Mackay, a hairstylist and grandmother from Kelowna, B.C., lost her family home in the wildfire that destroyed or damaged 190 homes last September. MacKay was returning from work when the evacuation order went out. She didn't have time to finish her commute before she had to leave town. The emotional roller-coaster in the months since has been intense, she said. There is the guilt of knowing her husband and daughters had to gather their belongings without her help. There is the heartbreak that her daughters no longer have all their family toys, and won't get to wear her wedding dress when they get married. \"I feel embarrassed that I mourn material possessions, but I do,\" she said through tears. \"That was 49 years of curated things that was gone into six inches of ash.\" Diana Boston had to flee her home in Merritt, B.C., in November 2021 when an atmospheric river flooded the city of 8,000 people just 100 km east of Lytton. Boston said they are still working to restore their home to its previous condition, and the nightmares continue. \"When it rains, we can't sleep,\" she said. Boston said she came to Ottawa with her daughter because she doesn't want others to live through the same experiences. And \"because we're done,\" she said. \"We need to put a cap on these emissions. We need to help this world. We need to have a greener, healthier future. Not for us. For the next generations.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6, 2024.
