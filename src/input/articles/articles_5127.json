    "title": "Amy Schumer Shares 'Horrible' Ozempic Experience And Why She Quit: \"I Was So Sick\"",
    "text": "Amy Schumer has always been very transparent regarding her journey with Ozempic, and it seems she’s ditching the medication for good this time.\nThe comedian and actress first started the weekly injections back in 2022, opening up during various talk shows and candid interviews.\nBut things came to a halt when the 43-year-old started experiencing extreme discomfort.\n- Amy Schumer has officially quit Ozempic due to experiencing severe nausea and vomiting.\n- Schumer wasn't able to play with her son Gene.\n- The actress urged more celebrities to be open about their weight loss methods.\nAmy Schumer is officially done with Ozempic\nImage credits: Noam Galai/Getty Images\nTurns out, those side effects were due to a GDF15 gene, causing her body to produce “abnormally low levels” of the hormone that cause “taste aversion, nausea, and vomiting,” according to the HER Foundation.\n“I have this gene — GDF15 — which makes you extremely prone to nausea, which is why I was so sick during my pregnancy,” Schumer revealed during SiriusXM’s The Howard Stern Show.\nSo when she tried using Ozempic, she found that she was stuck in bed all day with no energy and unable to keep her food down.\nThe most discouraging thing of all was the fact that many other users felt fine afterward.\n“So, I tried Ozempic almost three years ago, and I was, like, bedridden, I was vomiting, and then you have no energy, but other people take it and they’re all good,” she shared.\nWhile Schumer did manage to lose a considerable amount of weight, it prevented her from being able to play with her 5-year-old little boy, Gene.\nImage credits: amyschumer\nImage credits: The Howard Stern Show\n“I lost 30 pounds so quick,” she revealed. “I looked great, and I couldn’t lift my head off the pillow, so what’s the point?”\nShe added to talk show host Andy Cohen, “I was one of those people that felt so sick and couldn’t play with my son. I was so skinny, and he’s throwing a ball at me, and [I couldn’t].”\nThe New York native later went on and joked that all the advertised positives about Ozempic were nothing but “red flags” and commented on how skinny Oprah Winfrey now appeared — who has been actively taking the drug since 2023, as reported by Daily Mail.\nAs the news became public, those online shared what they knew about the additional dangers of Ozempic use.\nThe comedy star possesses a specific hormone that causes her body to experience extreme nausea and “vomiting”\nImage credits: amyschumer\n“A ton of people are having issues,” one person claimed, although none of this information has yet been confirmed. “Some people are having issues with their stomachs being eaten, some have gone blind, some have had major bone loss. There’s going to be massive lawsuits.”\nAnother added, “One of the ingredients is snake venom.”\nA mother shared her own experience, writing, “Can you believe my daughter’s nephrologist actually prescribed this to her after her second transplant. My thoughts were he’s insane and I told him that.”\n“Amy your beautiful, happy to hear your not on the Ozempic bandwagon!!” a fourth applauded.\nImage credits: amyschumer\nAlthough Ozempic didn’t work the way Schumer may have hoped, the Trainwreck star is proud that she’s always been open about her body and what’s being done to it.\n“You are on Ozempic or one of those things or you got work done,” she said, urging her fellow stars to talk more about their weight loss journey. “Just stop hiding it. Be real with the people.\n“When I got lipo, I said I got lipo,” she confessed, referring to the liposuction she had done in January 2022, which caused her to drop 170 pounds.\nImage credits: The Howard Stern Show\nRecently, doctors have also foreshadowed what an excessive amount of the medication may result in, especially seeing how big it is in Hollywood right now.\n“You can lose too much too fast, and you end up with sinking skin,” said Dr. Michael Hakimi, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, while another expert noted an uptick in demand for face fillers to combat the increasingly “unnatural look.”\n“You shouldn’t strive to be thin,” advised a netizen\nPoll Question\nThanks!

    "text": "HERE are some facts about our youth and labour markets. Some 26 million-odd five- to 16-year-olds are out of school in Pakistan. The World Bank estimates that around 77 per cent of children who are in schools are ‘learning poor’: they do not have the knowledge/ understanding and skills that they should for their age/ grade. Unemployment is high amongst Pakistan’s educated youth. But, at the same time, it is hard to fill vacant positions as it is not easy to find suitable candidates with the requisite skills. We also continue to have one of the lowest female labour force participation rates.\nEmigration numbers are seeing an uptick. The numbers would be higher if other countries were able or willing to take more people from Pakistan. But despite the tough conditions in other countries, millions are trying to leave. Recently, a number of tragic incidents in the Mediterranean have highlighted the extent to which young people from Pakistan are willing to go to in order to reach European countries. People spend hundreds of thousands of rupees to get a chance to reach Europe even illegally. They take tremendous risks to be able to end up in Europe as illegal aliens. This says a lot about the perceived and real lack of opportunities for young people in Pakistan. They clearly do not see a future for themselves here.\nA recent news item said that the KP government advertised positions for around 14,000-odd school teachers. More than 86,000 candidates, of at least graduate level, have applied. Of these, some 400 candidates have PhDs.\nI am involved with a number of organisations that hire people in the areas of human resources, finance, research, administration and teaching. Every time we advertise, we get tons of applications. It takes a long time to go through all of them. But in the end, we shortlist hardly a handful and when we interview people, many times, we do not get even a single suitable candidate.\nWe have so many young people in Pakistan. But most of them are uneducated and unskilled.\nWhat is happening here? We have so many young people in Pakistan. But most of them are uneducated and unskilled. They can only work in unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in the country or abroad. The returns of even unskilled labour are much higher outside the country. But going abroad legally is hard. So, we have a lot of illegal migration and desperation to leave.\nMost of the ‘educated’ in the country have had a poor quality education and their skills do not match their on-paper education or the expectations of employers. When one hires a graduate to work in the office, she is expected to have decent language, writing and communication skills. If she cannot write in correct English, is not familiar with computer basics, does not possess the communication skills needed to work in a professional setting, why would she be hired? And if I have to get a Master’s level graduate for even simple office work, what will happen to all the Bachelor’s level graduates?\nThe same is true of graduates of skills programmes at different levels of the educational ladder.\nIn fact, many local and some foreign universities are producing PhDs who do not have the requisite skills, knowledge or understanding required of doctorate degree holders. Though many universities are on the lookout for faculty, there are a few hundred PhDs who are unemployed at the same time. This is not due to subject mismatches — it is not that we have too many PhDs in Pakistan Studies, Islamiat or Urdu, while faculty jobs are available for business studies or computer science. We do have doctors in the relevant fields but the hiring authorities do not find them good enough for the job.\nWe are clearly in deep trouble and stuck in a poor equilibrium. The trouble is not that we are facing a brain drain. Even higher emigration numbers, given the numbers we have in Pakistan, would not make any difference in terms of brain or brawn. The trouble is that we are not training our brain and brawn to possess the quality standards we need for both domestic and foreign jobs.\nGiven the potential for remittances, the government would love to send millions of people abroad. Foreign remittances have been rising. They constitute one of the main factors that has kept the Pakistani economy afloat. But we cannot send too many people abroad as there are limits on what countries will accept and what they require, ie mostly educated or skilled people — and we do not have many coming out of Pakistani institutions — who meet international standards. A few medical, engineering, business and other programmes are of decent or good quality, but most are not. On the skills side we fare even more poorly. Degrees from many of our universities are not really thought highly of in most universities and few, if any, of our skills programmes have international certifications.\nAs long as the quality of our education and skills programmes remains poor, too many individuals will remain out of schools and universities and too many, even if they graduate from schools or universities, will not be able to have productive careers. Meanwhile, employers will not find people with the education and skills they need. They will make do with what is available, and that will affect the overall growth and productivity of the country. We will, of course, not be able to send abroad too many people in the skilled and educated category. The key here is quality: quality of education and quality of skills programmes. We have to resolve the quality issue on a priority basis.\nThe writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives and an associate professor of economics at Lums.\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2025",

    "text": "An active volcano threatens a south Pacific island resort and its guests as a power struggle ensues between the property's developer , James Franciscus , and a drilling foreman , Paul Newman . Molten lava and explosion spread across the island . As an all-star cast is on the run when Mother Nature blows her top .\nExciting film about a volcanic eruption threatens a Pacific island that packs blasts , thrills , overwhelming scenes of blowing up , suspense , excessive talking and turns out to be slightly entertaining . Allen's shameless rehash of all his disaster film clichés set on a Pacific island in which time never seems to run out , as a video version runs 141 minutes . Disastrous catastrophe movie in which lacks characterization , being an immense bore . Lousy screenplay by the prestigious Carl Foreman and Stirling Silliphant ; both of whom were presumably well paid . This formula intrigue movie belongs to catastrophe genre of the 70s , being the undisputed king , ¨The towering inferno¨ along with ¨Earthquake¨ , ¨Two minutes warning¨ and many others ; this formula disaster movie was widely developed by Irwin Allen , previously winner of numerous Oscars for ¨Poseidon¨ until the failures as ¨Beyond Poseidon¨, ¨Swarm¨ and this ¨When the time ran out¨ , retitled ¨Earth's final fury¨ . Filmed at the height of the disaster genre from the 7os , this entry in the spectacular series profits of an all-star though really wasted and a suspenseful final that takes place at a bridge surrounded by molten lava . The bridge was 30 feet above the stage, with smoke bombs and light flashes used to simulate the lava. Main cast carries out average acting such as Paul Newman , Jacqueline Bisset and William Holden , he was hospitalized for six days during production to treat his alcoholism after director James Goldstone convinced producer Irwin Allen that Holden was a danger to himself and others in the cast. Furthermore , a top-notch secondary casting such as Valentina Cortese , Barbara Carrera , Veronica Hamel , Alex Karras , Burgess Meredith , Red Buttons , James Franciscus , Pat Morita and Ernest Borgnine . Ernest Borgnine claims in his memoirs that the reason why the film's special effects were so cheap looking was that the huge amount spent on location shooting absorbed what was usually spent on FX. Many actors were all under contract with Irwin Allen, and appear in this film to void their contracts.\nColorful and gripping photography in Panavision by Fred J. Koenekamp . Intriguing and thrilling score by Lalo Schifrin in his usual style . This big-budgeted disaster movie was middlingly directed by James Goldstone ; this was final feature film of Goldstone . He was a director and writer, known for Scalplock (1966) , ¨Jigsaw¨ ,¨A Man Called Gannon¨ , ¨They Only Kill Their Masters¨ , ¨Red sky at morning¨ , ¨Winning\" or \"500 miles\" and ¨Swashbuckler¨ . Goldstone was also an ordinary TV movies director and subsequently made another catastrophe film , Roller-coaster (1977), much better than the disastrous and monumental bore ¨When time ran out¨ .\nWhen Time Ran Out...\n1980\nAction / Adventure / Drama / Thriller\nWhen Time Ran Out...\n1980\nAction / Adventure / Drama / Thriller\nLoading video, please wait...\nPlot summary\nAn active volcano threatens a south Pacific island resort and its guests as a power struggle ensues between the property's developer and a drilling foreman.\nUploaded by:\nFREEMAN\nDecember 28, 2023 at 01:12 PM\nDirector\nTop cast\nPaul Newmanas Hank Anderson Jacqueline Bissetas Kay Kirby Burgess Meredithas Rene Valdez Ernest Borgnineas Tom Conti\nTech specs720p.BLU 1080p.BLU\nMovie Reviews\nFailed and boring catastrophe movie that even a wasted all-star cast cannot save\nAn active volcano threatens a south Pacific island resort and its guests as a power struggle ensues between the property's developer , James Franciscus , and a drilling foreman , Paul Newman . Molten lava and explosion spread across the island . As an all-star cast is on the run when Mother Nature blows her top .\nMore like when the budget ran out\nWHEN TIME RAN OUT\nis a silly, superficial and often cheesy coda to the cycle of disaster movies produced by Irwin Allen in the 1970s. As a huge fan of disaster movies, I found myself enjoying this film a lot, even if everything that happens has been done before and better. This film sees an all-star cast menaced by a volcano on an Pacific island, and you can pretty much guess every plot point along the way if you've seen any of Allen's other, earlier, better disaster flicks.\nStill, you can't say that Allen doesn't try his best it's just that the budget (or lack of it) lets him down this time around. The volcano itself is a silly little miniature, the rivers of lava are back-projected nonsense, and the final 'disaster' scene at the hotel is so poor as to beggar belief. Even ignoring the below-par special effects, this film takes the biscuit. Although it's notably shorter than the likes of THE TOWERING INFERNO, it takes half the running time for the volcano to actually blow, and until that point we have lots of cheesy dialogue scenes involving romance between uninteresting characters.\nThankfully, things really get going once the disaster hits home as Allen throws tsunamis, explosions, cliffslides and whatnot into the mix. Twinkly-eyed Paul Newman is on hand, thankfully, to take charge and act all manfully, although he's up against a scheming James Franciscus as the island resort's owner who'll stop at nothing to protect his investments. Also caught up in the mix are the usual stereotypes: doting (or should that be dotty) old timers (step forward, Burgess Meredith); hard-timers (Ernest Borgnine in his umpteenth disaster outing), youthful beauties (Barbara Carrera and Jacqueline Bisset, the latter looking a bit off) and even a few ethnic types too (Pat Morita, going Chinese). Much of the resultant running time follows Newman's group as they scramble for safety, evading dangers along the way.\nIt's no surprise as to who lives or dies, but the 'obstacle' scenes are great fun, especially the extended 'bridge crossing' which makes up the film's climax. And I'll never tire of those ultra-cheesy 'falling into lava' shots which are repeated at various intervals. It's just a shame that the volcano itself only has coming of a cameo appearance in the movie, and that the characters are never menaced by ash clouds or falling lumps of pumice now that would have been something to see!\nOh, that volcano isn't going to erupt.\nYes, this is the typical 70's all-star disaster flick. Though this one was made in 1980. This one, however, was not a hit. When \"The Towering Inferno\" was in theaters, it made over 100 million at the box office. When this one was at theaters, it made less than 2 million. Part of the problem is that it doesn't look much like a movie for the theater. In fact, when I first saw it, I thought it was a made for television movie. I think most of the budget in this one went to the stars, and not nearly enough went into special effects. The story in this one is typical of a volcano movie as it has someone trying to warn people that the volcano is going to erupt. Of course no one believes them and then an eruption occurs. We have people getting fried, and a select group trying to head for safety. Along the way they have to cross a bridge, and it turns out there is someone who has a special ability to be put in use here like the character in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" who was an excellent swimmer. This one has some good qualities though and if you have nothing else to do it may be worth a look-see, but it is definitely nothing special.\nRead more IMDb reviews",

    "text": "Paige VanZant has opened up on the perils of cutting weight for UFC fights in a very candid discussion on her latest podcast episode with her husband, MMA fighter Austin Vanderford. Fighters often essentially dehydrate themselves to make the weight category for a fight and, as VanZant alluded too, often starve themselves or turn to other methods to flush their system out. Her husband Vanderford told VanZant he enjoyed the process, prompting her to tell him exactly how and why she does not. 'The best feeling in the world is after a weight cut, the next day,' Vanderford said. 'You feel so, so good.' VanZant, who fought in UFC for six years up to 2020, replied firmly, telling him: 'Nope. TMI, TMI, here I go: every time I cut weight. I s*** my pants.' Paige VanZant has boldly opened up about the perils of cutting weight for UFC fights VanZant, 29, fought in UFC for six years before stepping away from MMA back in 2020 She recently revealed that she makes more money through OnlyFans than by fighting She continued: 'Every single time I would weigh-in, I would try to rehydrate (and was) instantly sick. So, part of USADA (United States anti-doping agency) is once they see you, you cannot leave their sight, because, you know, it’s the whole anti-doping. 'Maybe you’re gonna go do something to mask the drugs or take something. I don’t even know. 'So, I had my drug tester in the bathroom with me for two hours, while I s*** my brains out.' VanZant is believed to be planning on a return to mixed martial arts at some stage but back in November, the 29-year-old opened up on how much money she has made through OnlyFans. 'OnlyFans has definitely been my largest source of income. I would say combined, in my fighting career,' she told Barstool Sports' Glenny Balls. 'I think I made more money in 24 hours on OnlyFans than I had in my entire fighting career. Combined. Yeah.'",
