    "text": "Marin County sees evacuation orders lifted in some areas In Marin County, evacuation orders have been canceled for areas around Stinson Beach. Earlier Thursday, some communities near the beach were told to be ready to go due to high surf and storm surge.\nSANTA CRUZ, Calif. - The Bay Area&apos;s beach towns got hammered on Thursday as high surf and storm surges ravaged the coastline.\nAround Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar State Beach in Santa Cruz, logs littered the sandy coast and onlookers sat on perches witnessing Mother Nature in action.\nIn addition, West Cliff in Santa Cruz was also closed between Columbia and David Way. The iconic road is still being repaired from last year&apos;s storms.\nMeanwhile, in Pacifica, a pair of crab fishers arrived at Linda Mar Beach and then turned around to go home.\n\"Apparently, that&apos;s not going to happen,\" Paul Gonzales said. \"But the pier&apos;s closed. These waves are outrageous.\"\nSteve Ramirez sighed and said: \"We&apos;re just going to pack up.\"\nHigh surf warnings and advisories are in effect along the entire California coast as waves are expected to break up to 40 feet high. As of Thursday afternoon, reports from the Bay Area&apos;s coastal buoys were showing waves just under 30 feet off both the Sonoma County coast and Monterey Bay.\nHuge low-pressure systems in the Pacific Ocean are pushing large groups of waves toward the California coast.\nThe National Weather Service reported that its buoy off Bodega Bay recorded waves up to 28 feet on Thursday morning, closing in on the previous record of 31 feet seen during January storms at the beginning of the year.\nEvacuation warnings lifted after high surf and flooding shut down Santa Cruz, coastal areas Around Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar Beach, the waves crashed over walls, flooding streets, and depositing massive trees and driftwood ashore.\n\"The trees act like battering rams against the houses and the garage doors that are along the street here,\" says resident, Steve Benedetti.\nResidents in Santa Cruz County know the danger all too well. So do the authorities. But they worried about the tourists.\n\"We do have visitors from out of town that may not have been expecting this kind of tidal surge during their visit. So we did have deputies out here very early going door to door explaining to people hey this is coming,\" says Ashley Keehn, public information officer with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&apos;s Office.\nEarly in the morning, the Stinson Beach Fire Department issued an evacuation order for several neighborhoods because of high surf as the winds and waves were enormous, telling people they could find a temporary safe harbor at the Stinson Beach Community Center.\nThe order was issued just before 10 a.m., and people were sent to the Stinson Beach Community Center for refuge. Residents in the Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera, Embarcadero, and sections of Calle Del Arroyo weren’t told to return to their homes until early in the afternoon.\nDrone pilot David Golubev shot video of the swell hitting the beach around 11 a.m. and getting dangerously close to houses and buildings along the shoreline.\n\"Definitely the highest tide I’ve seen so far. You could see it on the beach. It came up all the way to the top,\" Golubev said. \"I saw it was high tide, and I heard the water so I came out to see how far the water came up.\"\nOfficials said the waves reached 10 feet, more than the National Weather Service predicted.\nThe evacuation order was lifted in the early afternoon when the tide receded.\nStinson Beach Fire Chief Jesse Peri said crews are still assessing the damage in the area and at last count Thursday afternoon one person has minor injuries and a handful of homes suffered minor structural damage.\n\"The community is really resilient, so they came together to help sandbag and help each other out,\" said Peri, who reiterated that people should continue to stay away from the water.\nFurther south in San Francisco, strong swells crashed against San Francisco&apos;s Fort Point.\nImage 1 of 10 ▼ Rio Del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded in Santa Cruz on Dec. 28, 2023.

    "title": "Stillwater mine to cut production, lay off 700 workers as low metal prices drive losses",
    "text": "Sibanye Stillwater, the South African company that operates the nation’s only major palladium mine in south-central Montana, said Thursday that it plans to lay off about 40% of its Montana workforce as it scales back its operation in an effort to offset losses caused by low metal prices.\nIn a letter to workers , U.S. Executive Vice President Kevin Robertson said the company will halt mining at the west section of its Stillwater mine southwest of Columbus until prices rise. It also plans to restructure operations at its East Boulder mine south of Big Timber and its Columbus-area processing and recycling plant. In total, Robertson wrote, layoffs will reduce the company’s current workforce of 1,680 to “just under 1,000” starting Nov. 12.\n“We are proud to pay prevailing wages and follow robust environmental and other regulations. That’s why our communities thrive adjacent to our operations” Robertson wrote. “But, this responsible and sustainable mining and metals processing is much, much more expensive than that of our competitors in Russia and other areas.”\n“To compete with those low-cost operations, we need to solidify government and other stakeholder support in the long-term,” Robertson continued. “In the short-term, we have no choice but to reduce our losses as we continue to lobby for additional forms of financial support.”\nHeather McDowell, the company’s Montana-based spokesperson, echoed those claims in an interview Thursday.\n“Without a restructure, we didn’t have a sustainable business plan,” she said, saying the company had been on track for a $230 million loss this year.\n“When the market comes back, we can consider rebuilding our operations — that’s absolutely the idea,” McDowell said.\nSibanye Stillwater, an international mining conglomerate that purchased the Stillwater mine in 2017 , also has operations in South Africa, Europe and Australia.\nThe Stillwater and East Boulder operations, which straddle a section of the Beartooth Mountains, mine underground at opposite ends of a globally notable palladium and platinum deposit. The West Stillwater section that the company plans to mothball has been in operation since 1986 .\nMcDowell said Sibanye Stillwater conducted a prior round of cuts last year, laying off or reassigning about 90 workers as the company tried to reduce costs and boost production. However, she said, a quarterly filing deadline the publicly traded company faced this week forced it to announce further action in an effort to stem its ongoing losses.\nIn its letter, the company blamed its financial woes on current palladium prices — now below $1,000 an ounce, versus $2,305 an ounce two years ago — on “Russian dumping.” While the U.S. has banned imports of many Russian products as part of economic sanctions levied in protest of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it has not banned Russian palladium imports.\nMcDowell said the company had also been hoping a provision of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that authorized a manufacturing production tax credit for metals used in renewable energy production would lend its bottom line a helping hand. However, she said, the U.S. Treasury Department has interpreted that tax credit provision in a way that means it doesn’t apply to the company’s Montana operation, which sells partially processed palladium before the final step in the refining process.\nBoth of Montana’s U.S. senators, Democrat Jon Tester and Republican Steve Daines, announced separately Thursday that they will introduce bills that would ban Russian palladium imports. McDowell said both senators have also been pushing the federal treasury department to revise its interpretation of the Inflation Reduction Act (the full IRA was supported by Tester and opposed by Daines ).\n“It is totally unacceptable that Montanans are losing their jobs because Russia is dumping critical minerals into the American market to strangle our local operations,” Tester said in a statement announcing his palladium import ban bill.\n“There is no reason the United States should be importing critical minerals that we can find right here at home,” Daines said in his announcement. “Montana is rich in minerals, and we need to be supporting American mines and American jobs, not Russia’s.”\nSibanye Stillwater workers in Montana are represented by United Steelworkers Local 11-0001, which declined to make a representative available for an interview Thursday through the Montana AFL-CIO, the state’s umbrella organization for private sector unions. Montana AFL-CIO Executive Secretary Jason Small called the layoffs “devastating news” that would affect currently high-wage workers — and businesses that rely on their spending — across south-central Montana.\n“Those guys are making real money there — and a lot of them of course are bussing out of Billings, or other areas,” Small said. “It’s going to be pretty significant.”\nSmall also said that Montana AFL-CIO expects to work with the mine union and the state Department of Labor and Industry in an effort to support laid-off workers.\nThe state labor department said Thursday the 700-worker layoff represents about 13% of payroll jobs in Stillwater and Sweet Grass counties, as well as about 16% of mining jobs statewide. It also noted that mining jobs in Montana paid an average salary of $106,00 in 2023.\nThe department also said it plans to release a “skills matching tool” that will help laid-off workers identify new employment opportunities that take advantage of their current skills and hold in-person career fairs in Columbus in the coming weeks.\n“We will help affected workers navigate employment opportunities, identify any skill gaps needed to advance into new careers, and source funding for any necessary training programs needed to acquire additional skills,” labor commissioner Sarah Swanson said in a statement.\nLATEST STORIES Stillwater mine to cut production, lay off 700 workers as low metal prices drive losses Sibanye Stillwater, the South African company that operates the nation’s only major palladium mine in south-central Montana, has announced that it plans to lay off about 40% of its Montana workforce as it scales back its operation in an effort to offset losses caused by low metal prices.\nby Eric Dietrich 09.12.2024 09.12.2024 Missoula City Council considering water, sewer rate increases The Missoula City Council will consider increases to water, sewer and stormwater utility rates proposed to keep up with inflation, replace aging infrastructure and boost savings to pay for loans.\nby Katie Fairbanks 09.12.2024 09.12.2024 With the state’s worst rate for suicide, a Montana county is working to turn around its grim statistics Beneath Montana’s grand aesthetic is a bleak statistic: It’s one of the deadliest states in the nation for suicide.

    "title": "Story of a Chinese deminer in Cambodia shows solidarity, love - Global Times",
    "text": "Children play near a landmine warning and a Buddhist shrine in Cambodia in March, 2005. Photo: VCG\nIn the heart of Cambodia, a nation scarred by the remnants of war, Liu Wenzhi, a retired military veteran turned demining specialist, has embarked on a dangerous, yet fulfilling mission of landmine elimination.\nFor the veteran demining specialist, once in Cambodia, Liu found himself immersed in a landscape where landmines posed a constant threat to the safety of the local population. Casualties were frequently reported in the country and many villagers did not even dare to go to their farmland as many unidentified dangers lurking under the ground, make life of local people - who depend heavily on farming - even harder. Even so, what struck Liu most during his missions are the resilient and never-give-up spirit demonstrated by locals.\n\"I encountered individuals of various ages who had been disabled due to undiscovered landmine in Cambodia. Their stories painted a portrait of resilience - some continued their work with prosthetic limbs, others learned to play music after losing their eyesight, and a few exhibited extraordinary perseverance by joining the national basketball team. These people highlighted the indomitable spirit of humanity amid adversity,\" Liu told the Global Times.\nLiu once served in a field force for 12 years and took part in three peacekeeping operations in Lebanon. He had witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of landmines on people's lives during his participation in peacekeeping missions. Motivated by a deep understanding of the importance of peace, Liu eagerly embraced the chance to contribute his skills to a cause that resonated with his values.\nIn Cambodia, Liu is not alone in the demining missions as many Chinese people are actively contributing to this cause. His story is a testament to the transformative power of individuals and organizations working together for a common goal - a world where the haunting specter of landmines is replaced by the promise of peace and safety for generations to come.\nOn Thursday, a handover ceremony for China-supported mine-clearance equipment to Cambodia was held in Phnom Penh, where both countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on mine-clearance cooperation, according to local media reports.\n\"As Cambodia strives to achieve the mine-free goal by 2025 as scheduled, China stands ready to step up cooperation with Cambodia,\" China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular media briefing on Friday.\nMao noted that as one of the countries that are worst affected by landmines, Cambodia is, under the leadership of Prime Minister Hun Manet, making an all-out effort to achieve its mine-free goal by 2025. As a good neighbor, good partner and good brother of Cambodia, China has cared much about the landmine problem in Cambodia.\nSince 1998, China has been providing Cambodia with support of various forms, including funding, mine-clearance equipment and personnel training. Mine-clearance cooperation has become an important part of the China-Cambodia comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, an important component of the \"diamond hexagon\" bilateral cooperation framework, and a vivid example of the two sides working together to implement the Global Security Initiative, according to Mao.\nA difficult task\nIn early 2020, Liu discovered an opportunity to make a meaningful impact by joining the demining project run by the Peaceland Foundation, a Beijing-based NGO, after retiring from military. The demining project in Cambodia, initiated in 2019, has become a beacon of hope for a country haunted by this deadly legacy of war.\nAt the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in 2023, the demining team members from the Peaceland Foundation walked on the stage together with children from Cambodia, hand in hand, showing the solidarity and love which moved audiences.\nWhile Liu tried to tone down the hardship of demining, he admitted that the job is full of challenges. The foremost obstacle, he said , has been the funding gap, hindering the progress of demining initiatives. Environmental factors also play a significant role, with hot weather and the presence of mosquitoes posing considerable challenges. The tropical climate, characterized by high temperatures and humidity, creates extreme physiological challenges for demining team members. Insect bites not only affect morale and efficiency but also increase the risk of disease, further complicating the demining process, Liu told the Global Times.\nDemining is an inherently dangerous task, subjecting team members to immense psychological stress. Liu and his team must remain highly vigilant at all times to prevent accidents.\n\"This heightened state of tension not only affects the mental health of team members but can also lead to issues such as anxiety and depression. Addressing and alleviating these psychological pressures have become critical aspects of the demining mission,\" he said.\nCooperation and solidarity\nEnhanced cooperation with Cambodia, through bilateral or regional mechanisms, is essential to tackling technical challenges and management issues in demining. Furthermore, promoting education and raising awareness on the global stage can garner the support needed to prioritize and address the urgency of demining efforts, Liu said.\nDuring Liu's time in Cambodia, he together with his demining team have embraced a collaborative approach, engaging in mutual learning and exchanging technical expertise with their Cambodian counterparts. This cooperative spirit has strengthened their mission, fostering understanding and solidarity between diverse communities.\nOne of the most memorable moments in Liu's journey occurred when the responsibility for the safety of a minefield was handed over to local residents. Despite language barriers and differences in skin color, the expressions of understanding and solidarity transcended these obstacles, symbolizing a shared commitment to peace, Liu recalled.\nIn addition to the work done by the Chinese NGOs, at the governmental level many efforts have paid off with successful results.\nLy Thuch, senior minister and first vice-president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA), said at a recent press conference that the China-Aided Cambodia Landmines Elimination Project, which has been carried out in three phases from 2018 and 2025, has helped find and destroy approximately 78,000 landmines and unexploded ordinances, Xinhua reported.\n\"We had cleared more than 107 square km land with the support from China, a huge achievement, creating 1.5 million beneficiaries,\" he said after receiving a new shipment of mine clearance equipment from China, Xinhua reported.\nAs the demining project enters a new year, Liu said they also plan to set up a new team to join local efforts in eliminating landmines, which will be built upon the current working model, contributing to Cambodia's ongoing journey toward a landmine-free future.",

    "title": "Expert Warns of Increased Blood Clot Risk in Cold Weather: How to Minimize the Danger",
    "text": "Blood clotting is a way to prevent bleeding in cases of wounds, and although this response is beneficial for our\nhealth, in some cases clots can be life-threatening.\nWhen jelly-like lumps appear in veins and arteries without cause, they can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. What is worrying is that outside temperature could play a role in this process, according to one expert.\nSudden changes in temperature, such as when people enter a warm building after being outside in the cold, can cause heat stress to the body. This can make your body work harder to maintain a constant temperature. The viscosity of the blood can also be affected, making it more viscous and more likely to clot, according to Professor Mark Whitley, consultant vein surgeon and founder of the Whitley Clinic.\nProfessor Whiteley explained that the risk of heart attacks can increase in cold\nweather, saying: “This may be due to increased clotting in the coronary arteries, but it could also be due to increased resistance to pumping blood around the body in cold weather when all the arteries narrow to reduce heat loss.” From the skin, which makes the heart work harder. Therefore, it has not been proven that this is definitely due to blood clotting. Interestingly, there does not seem to be a significant difference between people with coronary heart disease who exercise in normal weather or cold weather, which indicates “Moderate exercise in cold weather is not at all dangerous and may be beneficial.”\nThe expert added that cold\nweather is also linked to an increased risk of a different type of blood clot, which is pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to an artery in the lung and stops it. However, Professor Whitley added that deep vein thrombosis, which is blood clots in the deep veins, is more likely to occur as temperatures drop.\nResearch published in the journal\nInternational Angiology also warns that low temperatures appear to be “significantly associated” with deep vein thrombosis. The study looked at patients who were hospitalized with deep vein thrombosis in Shenyang, China, over a ten-year period.\nThe results showed that lower ambient temperatures were associated with symptoms of DVT, with the effects of the cold sometimes delayed by up to one week.\nFortunately, Professor Whitley explained how to keep the risk of clotting in the colder months to a minimum, saying: “It is clearly sensible to stay warm if possible. Smoking should be avoided because nicotine causes arterial spasm and increases proteins which can increase the risk of blood clotting. “In the long run, smoking also damages blood vessel walls by causing inflammation. Exercise is always beneficial because good blood flow through the blood vessels keeps the blood vessel wall healthy and reduces the risk of any blood clots inside the vessel.”\n2023-12-28 05:29:52\n#factor #increases #risk #blood #clots",

(WSFA) - Cool nights and mornings continue into the weekend, all giving way to sunny, warm and comfortable afternoons both Saturday and Sunday. A cold front arrives Monday, while it could squeeze out a shower. The big story with this front will be the colder temperatures that will arrive by midweek next week. Out-the-door this morning expect a clear sky, temperatures in the 50s with some upper 40s sprinkled in and light winds. By this afternoon, expect wall-to-wall sunshine. Highs will warm into the upper 70s to lower 80s. Winds will be out of the east around 5 to 10 mph, becoming light tonight. Lows will dip into the 40s and 50s overnight, all under a clear sky and light winds. Picture perfect, fall weather is expected this weekend. Afternoon highs Saturday will warm into the lower 80s, while afternoon highs rebound back into the upper 80s by Sunday. A sunny sky is expected with just a few fair weather clouds, both days this weekend. Winds will shift from the northwest Saturday back to the southwest sunday. Overnight lows hover in the 50s and 60s. Watch the latest live and local weather data below, streaming on WSFA Weather Now! Please note, this stream does not include live severe weather coverage, only data on the latest weather conditions. A cold front is projected to move across the region on Monday. That could squeeze out a shower or two, but the front is looking mainly dry as it passes. A few clouds will be possible to start next week, with highs remaining in the middle to upper 80s and lows in the 50s and 60s. The big story with the aforementioned front, will be the drop in temperatures. As the coldest air of the Fall season will arrive. Afternoon highs Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday will be in the lower to middle 70s, with overnight lows in the 40s and 50s. Each day will feature sunny afternoons and clear overnights. First Alert Update: The forecast is looking dry over the next 7 to 10 days. We could use the rain, as the latest drought monitor issued Thursday morning shows much of Alabama under abnormally to moderate drought conditions. Which will only worsen as the dry weather persists. Tracking the Tropics: Milton has officially dissipated and is no longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center. Tropical Storm Leslie is still churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Movement is north and then east, meaning it will remain in the ocean and NOT impact the United States. The NHC is monitoring a potential area that has a medium chance for development over the next week. This area they are watching is off the coast of Africa and thousands of miles away from the United States. Copyright 2024 WSFA. All rights reserved.",
