    "text": "News Students  | December 5, 2024\nVamsi Jupudi took top prize for his proposal for BrightLyf, a mental health app for college students.\nTen students pitched business ideas on Wednesday morning after completing an eight-week course, and three students were able to earn seed money to kickstart their business. Vamsi Jupudi, Kameryn Mitchell and Jamarion Willie Hughes each won seed money.\nThe event, sponsored by the Regions Foundation, was held at the IDEA Bank and students pitched ideas to a panel of judges. It was just part of the “TROY Starters: Idea Accelerators powered by Regions Foundation” program, which encompasses three different accelerator programs hosted by the IDEA Bank.\n“The main goal of the event is to help students learn how to put together a business plan and pitch and give them a safe space to experiment while growing their confidence,” said Lynne George, the director of the IDEA Bank. “I’ve seen them go from having broad ideas to a refined business plan.\nTROY student Stephanie Pereff pitches her company, Nelson Nutrition. (TROY photo) “Anyone can come up with an idea, the dedication to the refinement of that idea and the commitment to continuous learning sets apart successful entrepreneurs from the rest.”\nJupudi won the grand prize of $2,000 after pitching BrightLyf, an idea for an AI-powered mental health platform.\n“This win not only proves that our work is important but also encourages us to improve ourselves even more,” Jupudi said. “We’re planning to use the seed money to officially register the company and launch a pilot program here at Troy University.\n“Before the program, we just had an idea but didn’t know how to turn it into a real business. The program taught us how to raise funds and make better business decisions. Most importantly, it helped us connect with key people at the university who will be valuable partners as we move forward.”\nStudents were able to learn more about the details of starting a business and identifying a target market.\n“I learned a lot about the marketing mix and how to determine my market’s need for my services,” said Savannah Burg, a junior global management major from Livingston. “This experience has helped me learn the necessary steps to starting my business.”\nAlthough only three students won seed money, George said that the skills learned by just giving a pitch will help students whatever they do.\n“Pitching is transferable no matter what you do,” George said. “Even if these students don’t go on to start a business, they stood up in front of a panel of judges and a group of people, which is no easy task. Practicing public speaking leads to the development of many transferrable skills like enhanced confidence, professionalism, organization, networking. You can use those skills no matter what you do.”\nThe Regions Foundation funded the whole program, and Market Executive John Brown announced that another event will be held in spring 2025, offering approximately $10,000 in seed money. He said the event will cap off the TROY Starters: Idea Accelerators program.\nTROY student Stephanie Pereff pitches her company, Nelson Nutrition.

    "text": "(CNN) — Hamas said it has accepted a ceasefire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar, which seeks to halt the seven-month war with Israel in [Gaza](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-05-06-24-intl-hnk/index.html), prompting Israel to say it would send a delegation to negotiate – though it warned the proposal remained far from the “necessary requirements.” In a statement Monday, Hamas said the head of its political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, told the Qatari prime minister and Egyptian intelligence minister that the militant group had accepted their proposal. Shortly afterwards, Israel said the proposal Hamas had accepted was still far from the “necessary requirements,” but that it would send a delegation to the mediators. It also reiterated its commitment to carrying out an offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying its war cabinet had “unanimously decided” to continue with the operation “to exert military pressure on Hamas.” Prior to Israel’s response, Palestinians had been celebrating in the streets over Hamas’ announcements. In Tel Aviv, hostage families and their supporters implored Israel’s leaders to accept the deal. The details of the proposals Hamas says it has agreed to remain unclear, and whether it is referring to the most recent ceasefire proposal, as outlined last week, or a revised version of it. A senior Israeli and a senior US official said that Hamas had agreed to a framework proposal, which diverges from the one Israel had helped craft with Egypt. The latest proposal calls for an end to the war, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will not accept, the senior American official said. Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, said Monday there were “significant gaps” between Israel and Hamas. “Despite this, we continue to turn over every stone and a delegation will go to Cairo.” The previously reported framework, which Israel helped craft but had not fully agreed to, called for the release of between 20 and 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. After the initial exchange, according to that framework, there would follow what sources describe as the “restoration of sustainable calm” during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners. The White House on Monday confirmed that there had “been a response from Hamas” to a proposed hostage deal in Israel, and that US President Joe Biden had been briefed on that response, but otherwise declined to weigh in specifically on what a deal could entail. Biden is “aware of where the situation and where the process is,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby told a press briefing. CIA Director Bill Burns remains in the region “working in real time on the ground,” Kirby added. “We still believe that reaching an agreement is the absolute best outcome not only for the hostages, but for the Palestinian people and we’re not going to stop working to that outcome,” he said. The news comes just hours after Israel [ordered](https://cnn.com/2024/05/06/middleeast/israel-gaza-eastern-rafah-evacuation-notice-hnk-intl/index.html) Palestinians living in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, to “evacuate immediately.” The order raised fears that Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city could be imminent. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of the north of Gaza. A source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release. IDF operations ongoing Asked whether Hamas’ acceptance of a deal could change Israel’s plans for Rafah, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the military would continue to operate in Gaza. He said operations are ongoing, but that the IDF is making every effort in the negotiations to bring the hostages home as “fast as possible.” Netanyahu has come under fierce pressure from the more extreme wing of his coalition not to accept the ceasefire proposal outlined last week, and to focus instead on destroying Hamas in Rafah. Orit Strook, Israel’s settlements minister and a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, said last week that accepting the deal would “throw” Israel’s military progress “in the trash.” Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s national security minister, said Netanyahu had “promised that Israel would enter Rafah, assured that the war would not end, and pledged that there would be no reckless deal.” But large parts of the Israeli public have demanded Netanyahu accept a deal. Families and supporters of the hostages blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv last week, holding a banner reading: “Rafah or the hostages – choose life.” Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet but seen as a rival and possible successor to Netanyahu, said the return of hostages was more urgent that entering Rafah. Responding to Monday’s announcement, the Hostages Families Forum said: “Now is the time for all that are involved, to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages.” This is a developing story and will be updated.
