    "text": "Let it snow! Northern Michigan ski resorts welcome big weekend snowstorm [Karly Graham](/staff/10211246002/karly-graham/) NORTHERN MICHIGAN — While some are planning to spend their weekends inside cozied up by the fire, others are getting ready to hit the slopes. Winter in Northern Michigan is primetime for skiing, but the 2023-24 season started off slow, with less snow than usual. According to the [National Weather Service,](https://www.weather.gov/apx/snow) average snowfall throughout the entire region has been down compared to other years. As of Friday morning, Petoskey has seen a total of 29.3 inches of snow. Usually by this time of year, the city would have seen 54.6 inches of snow. Gaylord has seen 39 inches, usually seeing 71.3 inches by this time. Treetops Resort in Gaylord has been able to stay open with a snow-making team working \"around the clock, almost literally,\" to keep a few runs and lifts open, according to marketing manager Jordan Peck. With a serious snowstorm expected to bring plenty of fresh powder to the region over the weekend, Treetops will be opening several natural snow runs as well as opening parts of the terrain park. The resort's cross country trails opened for the first time Thursday after snowfall earlier in the week. \"This is definitely going to make the road to a full open much easier over the next week or two,\" Peck said. At Mount Bohemia in Lac La Belle in the Upper Peninsula, President Lonie Glieberman said the resort hasn't been able to open yet due to the lack of snow. Mount Bohemia famously uses only natural snow, unlike other ski areas that use snow-making equipment. They have a tentatively scheduled open date for Jan. 17 — but they don't want anything set in stone. \"We're superstitious, so we just take a very conservative approach,\" Glieberman said. \"We don't expect (to open) before Wednesday.\" Until enough snow has fallen, Glieberman isn't ready for full celebrations. \"We live with the idea that we don't count things until they happen,\" he said. \"We will express joy after it happens.\" People can check the resort website for updates at [mtbohemia.com](https://www.mtbohemia.com/).

It’s been great having the colder temperatures allowing our teams to make a lot of snow, combined with the steady, natural snowfall we've seen over the past week,\" Erin Ernst, Boyne Resorts Director of Communications, wrote in a statement. \"A big boost of natural snowfall is exciting for winter enthusiasts and allows us to expand and open additional terrain as well as additional resort offerings like our tubing parks.\" More information about hours and conditions can be found [online](https://www.boynemountain.com/). — Contact reporter Karly Graham at [kgraham@petoskeynews.com.](mailto:kgraham@petoskeynews.com) Follow her on Twitter at [@KarlyGrahamJRN](https://twitter.com/KarlyGrahamJRN).",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
