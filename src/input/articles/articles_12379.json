Turnovers on shot selection ended up being the Achilles heel for the Wildcats. Springwood finished with 14 turnovers in the game.

    "text": "Última hora en elEconomista.es15\nLa Fundación del Metal para la Formación ha presentado en Aula el proyecto Generación del Metal con el que pretende dar respuesta a la falta de relevo generacional y de perfiles especializados por cubrir. Este ciclo dará a conocer a los jóvenes la alta empleabilidad del sector y las buenas condiciones económicas y laborales que ofrece. Y es que el sector necesitará cubrir 350.000 empleos de calidad en los próximos años.\nGeneración del Metal pone el foco en las condiciones de la profesión en el sector del metal y lo hace pensando en los jóvenes en las edades que deciden qué estudiar y trabajar, pero también dando un giro de 180 grados a la percepción de la juventud, a la que se suele vincular con la etiqueta \"Generación de Cristal\", como si fuera frágil y vulnerable, cuando se trata de una generación fuerte y resistente como el metal.\n¿Razones? Es una generación muy formada, pero con perspectivas más pesimistas que sus padres y con más incertidumbres sobre su futuro. Luchan, en cambio, por una estabilidad vital, dar solidez a sus vidas y construirse una carrera profesional satisfactoria.\nUn salario superior a la media\nNo se trata solo de alta empleabilidad, sino que además existen muy buenas condiciones. Una persona que trabaje en el metal accede a un salario medio de más de 2.000 euros netos al mes. Si hablamos de bruto anual, es un 43% superior al salario medio en España entre todos los sectores (dato INE de 2022).\nAdemás, los sueldos y las condiciones laborales están sujetos a la negociación colectiva. En el último año, las nóminas crecieron un 3% en el sector, ligeramente por encima del aumento de los precios, llevando a los trabajadores a ganar poder adquisitivo frente a sus facturas, al consumo y al ahorro con seguridad y tranquilidad. Desde 2020, el incremento de los sueldos ha sido superior al 10% en el metal.\nPara completar el círculo de buenas condiciones, existen otros beneficios sociales como seguros de vida, coberturas de incapacidad e incentivos a la jubilación.\nDesterrar mitos de la profesión\nUna de las líneas de trabajo de la iniciativa Generación del Metal es desterrar mitos sobre la profesión. Desde que es un trabajo eminentemente físico, cuando en realidad muchos puestos de trabajo están vinculados con robótica, diseño en 3D o automatización de procesos. O bien, negocios tradicionales que han evolucionado en su actividad, pero con una percepción desactualizada como el taller, dado que es una profesión cada vez más tecnológica y en la que está ya entrando la inteligencia artificial.",

    "title": "Tech Veteran Jennifer Bonnett Returns to Atlanta to Drive the City’s Bid to Become a Top 5 Tech Hub",
    "text": "Over the past few weeks, a sense of anticipation has been building across Atlanta’s tech scene. At networking events and startup hubs, the same question kept surfacing: “Did you hear who’s coming back?”\nThe answer, spoken with enthusiasm each time, was that Jennifer Bonnett had moved back to Atlanta.\nBonnett, a veteran of Atlanta’s tech ecosystem, has played pivotal roles as a technologist, founder, C-suite executive, and community builder. After six years in Savannah, she’s back in Atlanta and is ready to steer the city’s tech scene into its next era as the new Vice President of Technology and Entrepreneurship at Invest Atlanta .\nAtlanta’s Tech Ecosystem Over The Years Bonnett’s career provides a unique lens on the evolution of Atlanta’s startup landscape.\nA self described “recovering technologist,” Bonnett built her career in coding, consulting, and software development at Fortune 1000 companies before moving into startups in 1997. She was the founding VP of Technology for Atlanta-based eTour (acquired by Ask.com in 2001), joining CEO Roger Barnette at the early stages of the company.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bonnett said there was less of a “cohesive ecosystem” of startups in the city and there were just a few startup-focused programs in the city like ATDC, eHatchery, TAG, and the CEO Council. But most of the investor events were “closed door and behind the scenes.”\n2008 served as an inflection point for both Bonnett and the wider Atlanta startup ecosystem. A mentor of hers moved to California because he was unable to raise funds locally, bemoaning the lack of a strong and collaborative startup ecosystem in town. Bonnett said that was her “impetus for getting involved” to activate the startup community.\nShe told Hypepotamus that her guiding question from the beginning was “how do we make Atlanta a better place for startups?”\nBonnett speaking at Hypepotamus’ physical space in 2013\nBonnett founded StartupChicks in 2009 to connect and educate women entrepreneurs. The organization grew to over 10,000 members. That led Bonnett to Georgia Tech’s ATDC (Advanced Technology Development Center) , where she expanded the organization’s educational programs and outreach across the State of Georgia.\nAfter serving as ATDC’s Director and General Manager, Bonnet moved to coastal Georgia to be closer to her aging parents in 2018. She served as the executive director of The Creative Coast in Savannah, a non-profit organization focused on developing the Savannah region’s technology ecosystem.\nBonnett’s Next Chapter Bonnett was on sabbatical when the job posting for Invest Atlanta came up, but she said people across her network in Atlanta kept telling her to look into the position.\n“The job description just aligned so much with my background and my beliefs around ecosystem development,” she told Hypepotamus.\nBut there was one more crucial thing that made it easy for her to say yes to moving back to Atlanta. She recognized that Atlanta has started “aligning itself around the idea that [the city] could be a Top 5 tech hub. There’s a lot of questions about figuring out the ‘how.’ But the why and the overall mission, there’s a unified consensus that this is what we want…from the Mayor, to the economic developers, to the chamber, and the powers that be within the tech community.”\nPrepping For The Future As Vice President, Bonnett’s goals are threefold. She is charged with running and revamping WEI (the Women’s Entrepreneurship Initiative), attracting and retaining high-quality tech jobs in the city, and solidifying Atlanta’s place as a Top 5 tech hub.\nShe will work closely with Donnie Beamer and the City’s Office of Innovation and Technology to make that last point a reality. Beamer and Bonnett are even setting KPIs (Key performance indicators) together to ensure they are working in lockstep to achieve that goal.\nJust several weeks into the position, Bonnett said she is spending a lot of time on a “listening tour” to connect or reconnect with people across Atlanta’s startup ecosystem.\nThe Invest Atlanta role is a natural extension of Bonnett’s unique entrepreneurial journey. Now, she is ready to lead the city’s startup ecosystem through its next chapter as a major technology player.\n“There will be a lot of challenges in the details … .but it’s an exciting time,” she added. “I was part of the start…and I want to be part of the rest of the ride.”",

This storm should reach the coast by 9:55 a.m.,\" according to the weather service. \"Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Bandon, Sunset Bay State Park, Charleston, Bullards Beach State Park and Barview.\nAccording to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nLightning on the horizon: Expert safety measures for thunderstorms\nLightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\nLightning safety plan:\n- When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.\n- Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby.\n- Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.\nIndoors safety measures:\n- Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors.\n- Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges.\nWait for the all-clear:\n- After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.\n- It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.\nWhen indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\n- Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, which expose you to greater lightning risk.\n- Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.\n- If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.\n- Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning.\n- Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.\nIn summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety.\nRainy roadways ahead: Essential safety tips for heavy rain\nRain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nAvoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nOn wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.\nPrioritize visibility\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",

    "title": "INEI: alcalde de Cusco rechaza encuesta de seguridad ciudadana y la califica de ‘negativa’",
    "text": "En la tercera sesión del Comité Regional de Seguridad Ciudadana (Coeisec), las autoridades de Cusco expresaron su rechazo hacia los resultados de una reciente encuesta del INEI que sitúa a la ciudad con una elevada percepción de inseguridad. Según el informe, entre noviembre de 2023 y abril de 2024, el 93.8% de la población encuestada percibe a Cusco como una urbe insegura, un dato que genera controversia entre las autoridades locales. El alcalde de Cusco, Luis Pantoja, criticó duramente el informe del INEI, al argumentar que distorsiona la realidad y daña la reputación internacional de la ciudad imperial. Asimismo, mostró su disconformidad al asegurar que otras regiones del país cuentan con mayor índice de delincuencia. &quot;Nos esforzamos por revitalizar nuestra economía local. Es inaceptable que el INEI nos catalogue como más peligrosos que el Callao; algo debe estar fallando en sus métodos de medición&quot;, declaró el burgomaestre sobre su preocupación con la medición del Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática. Autoridades aseguran estar en desacuerdo con resultados Por su parte, el general PNP Julio Becerra Cámara, jefe de la unidad Región Policial Cusco, mostró su desacuerdo con los resultados de la encuesta. &quot;No puedo afirmar que esté equivocada, pero personalmente discrepo. La gente puede caminar por nuestras calles sin temor. Este resultado sugiere que 93 de cada 100 personas se sienten inseguras, lo cual es cuestionable&quot;, expresó el oficial. Ante la controversia, el presidente de la Cámara de Comercio de Cusco también se pronunció, señalando que esta percepción negativa podría impactar negativamente en la imagen de la ciudad, especialmente en el sector empresarial. Se espera un pronunciamiento formal por parte del gremio en las próximas horas. Este es el mapa que mostró la encuesta hecha por INEI. Foto: INEI Estadísticas provocaron debate en Cusco En conclusión, las autoridades locales están solicitando al INEI explicaciones detalladas sobre los métodos y criterios utilizados en la encuesta, así como la validez de los resultados. Esta situación ha desatado un debate en Cusco sobre la fiabilidad de las estadísticas de percepción de seguridad y su repercusión en la comunidad y el turismo local.
