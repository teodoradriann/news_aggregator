    "text": "Wallabies Face British & Irish Lions Without Star Player Valetini\nWallabies coach Joe Schmidt expressed confidence in Nick Champion de Crespigny's potential impact during his test debut for the first clash against the British & Irish Lions, despite key player Rob Valetini's injury-related absence. Scrumhalf Jake Gordon and newcomer Tom Lynagh are set to feature prominently as the team rearranges its lineup.\nWallabies coach Joe Schmidt has acknowledged the setback of missing key player Rob Valetini for the opening test against the British & Irish Lions. However, Schmidt is optimistic that flanker Nick Champion de Crespigny will deliver a strong performance in his debut at Lang Park on Saturday.\nValetini, celebrated as Australia's top test player for two consecutive years, will sit out yet another match due to a calf injury, alongside Will Skelton. Schmidt indicated the pair were nearing fitness and might have played if it were the series finale.\nReplacements include loose forward Langi Gleeson's available slot now filled by Champion de Crespigny, who returned from France. Meanwhile, Jake Gordon's comeback post-hamstring injury teams him with Tom Lynagh, stepping in for the injured Noah Lolesio. With a revamped lineup, the Wallabies are poised for their weekend clash.",

Photo: I-Hwa Cheng/AFP. Typhoon Kong-rey was packing wind speeds of 184 kilometres an hour (114 miles per hour) when it slammed into eastern Taiwan on Thursday , uprooting trees, triggering floods and landslides, and knocking out power as it swept over the island.\nA 48-year-old motorcyclist was killed by a falling power pole in the capital Taipei on Thursday, taking the storm’s death toll to two, with more than 500 injured, the National Fire Agency said.\nA search was also underway for four people who went hunting in the mountains of central Taiwan on Wednesday and have not been heard from since that evening.\nTwo Czech hikers who were trapped in the Taroko Gorge in Hualien county during the typhoon were rescued on Friday.\nKong-rey weakened to a severe tropical storm as it moved across the Taiwan Strait towards China on Friday, the Central Weather Administration said.\nIn Taiwan, life was returning to normal, with offices, restaurants and schools reopening.\nEmbed from Getty Images But nearly 100,000 households were still without power and 191 domestic and international flights were cancelled.\nDozens of ferry services and some train lines remained suspended.\n“The typhoon was so strong yesterday,” Pan Li-chu told AFP at her restaurant in Taipei, where the awning had been bent by the wind.\nMud and rocks Kong-rey dumped more than a metre of water in some of the hardest-hit areas along the east coast, the Central Weather Administration said.\nTorrential rain in Toucheng town, in Yilan county, sent mud and debris flowing down the street and into a building in Wu Hsuan-kai’s backyard.\nWu said he was watching television on Thursday morning when he heard a strange “rumbling sound”.\n“When I opened the door, I saw a mudslide coming down slowly. I picked up my car key and rushed out,” Wu, 55, told AFP.\nEmbed from Getty Images In Taitung county, where the storm made landfall, a fire department official told AFP there had been no reports of “severe damage”.\n“It’s mostly trees falling down and crushing into electricity poles that caused a power outage,” said the official, who gave only his surname Huang.\n“There are four reported cases of flooding and all have receded. There are also three reported cases of mudslides, including one near a tunnel, which we are verifying now.”\nFurther north in Hualien county, some residents living in the mountains were assessing the damage to houses hit by landslides.\n“There are mud, small rocks, big rocks and driftwood — I don’t know where they came from,” a resident in Zhuoxi village told local news channel TVBS.\n“I can’t go inside (my home). In some houses the mudslides are more than waist-high, it’s a little better in my home which is below the knees.”\nModel workers Across the island, workers were up before dawn clearing trees, branches and other debris from roads.\n“We started cleaning from 5:00 am till now and have only cleaned one road section. It took us about two and a half hours,” Lee Chia-hsin, a member of the New Taipei City cleaning crew, told AFP.\nEmbed from Getty Images In the southern city of Kaohsiung, Australian firefighter calendar models visiting for a charity event put on high-visibility vests to help clear debris.\n“Happy and proud that we could come out and assist your crews and give back to the Taiwanese people,” one of the firefighters told local media.\nForecasters had warned of a severe impact from Kong-rey as it intensified into a super typhoon during its approach to Taiwan.\nMore than 11,500 people fled their homes.\nKong-rey was the same strength as Typhoon Gaemi, which was the most powerful storm to hit Taiwan in eight years when it made landfall in July, but Kong-rey’s radius of 320 kilometres made it the biggest in nearly three decades.\nTaiwan is accustomed to frequent tropical storms from July to October, but the weather agency said it was unusual for such a powerful typhoon to hit this late in the year.\nScientists have warned climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.\nSupport HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team\nLATEST FROM HKFP Hong Kong police crime unit takes over journalist intimidation cases, press group says First tenants of Hong Kong’s Choi Hung Estate to begin moving out in 2028 as redevelopment set for 2049 completion More than 1,200 criminal cases of domestic abuse handled by Hong Kong police in 2023, highest since 2019 Elderly activist who displayed banners at Hong Kong’s Lion Rock did not breach law as act was impermanent, lawyer says HKFP has an impartial stance , transparent funding , and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy .\nSupport press freedom & help us surpass 1,000 monthly Patrons : 100% independent, governed by an ethics code & not-for-profit.",

    "title": "Kody and Robyn Brown List Home for Sale; Is the Marriage Over?!?",
    "text": "As every reader must know by now, Kody Brown no longer has any sister wives. Over the past two years or so, Christine, Meri and Janelle Brown have ALL walked away from their spiritual spouses. With [Kody feeling openly betrayed by their actions](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kody-brown-plays-the-victim-whines-on-sister-wives-ive-been-betrayed/), a brand new report has left us wondering: Might Kody Brown soon have no wives at all?!? The father of 17 has been legally married to Robyn Brown since 2014, and all three of the aforementioned ex-spouses have cited how deeply Kody cares for her as a major reason for their decision to leave. But all is no longer peachy keen between the pair. Robyn reportedly feels pretty [dumb for sticking with Kody](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/robyn-brown-am-i-an-idiot-for-sticking-with-kody/) — and we now have a reason to believe she may be done with the selfish plural marriage fan as well. According to In Touch Weekly, [Robyn and Kody have listed](https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/sister-wives-robyn-and-kody-brown-list-flagstaff-house-for-sale-excl/) their Flagstaff, Arizona, home for sale; they’re asking $1,650,000 for the residence. The house was built in 2007 sits on a two-acre wooded lot “tucked away behind towering pines on a secluded ridge,” the listing posted on Thursday, August 29, reads. The 4,476-square-foot house includes five bedrooms and four bathrooms. There’s also “primary bedroom with a luxurious, spa-like en-suite bathroom, complete with a large dual-head shower and built-in shelving in the walk-in closet,” the huge kitchen comes with a double oven, a commercial-size refrigerator/freezer and a walk-in pantry. Other amenities include a game room, two laundry rooms and an extra-wide garage. It’s unclear what is going on here. However, this real estate news comes amid speculation that [Robyn is miserable in her marriage](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/robyn-brown-miserable-on-the-verge-of-leaving-kody/). “Robyn and Kody are not doing well. They have been very unhappy… [and] it’s getting worse,” a source said just this week to The Sun. The main reason behind the tension, per this same tabloid? Kody is “just really mad at the world right now. He’s not who he used to be at all. He’s completely changed. He’s angry and he’s volatile, and he doesn’t like anybody that’s not worshiping him.” Previously, Robyn confessd that she’s been shocked and saddened by the end of her plural family. She’s been candid about her mental state. Heck, [she even compared it to a death](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/robyn-brown-im-mourning-the-death-of-my-plural-marriage/). “I don’t know what to do with it. It’s messing with my identity,” she said on the latest Sister Wives One-on-One special before bursting into tears. Will Robyn actually take same step as Meri, Christine and Janelle? We doubt it, but Kody is “controlling so much of her life right now” that it has made her “not happy,” The Sun also wrote a couple days ago. “Robyn is not committed to staying if things don’t change. That’s just what it has come down to. Their marriage is not going to sustain this kind of control,” the insider concluded.",

    "text": "Ericsson announced extensive enhancements to its radio, transport and antenna portfolio with 12 new hardware and software solutions for communications service providers (CSPs) to deploy in high-performing, sustainable and open networks. Mobile World Congress 2024 event in London, the portfolio enhancements are led by the flagship product AIR 3255, a Massive MIMO time division duplex (TDD) radio with more than 25 percent energy savings and 20 percent lower embodied carbon footprint* compared to the previous generation radio. AIR 3255 is equipped with new small metal filter technology that is scalable to all TDD sub-6GHz frequency bands to incentivize 5G mid-band deployment. This radio is also the first to use the new generation of Massive MIMO Ericsson Silicon (System on a Chip) with enhanced receiver processing and improved energy efficiency. In addition, AIR 3255 uses only one printed circuit board that is unique to the industry in terms of building practice, as well as passive cooling. The following new radios join AIR 3255 in boosting Ericsson’s radio line-up, making it the most comprehensive and sustainable Open RAN-prepared (packet fronthaul-based eCPRI) radio portfolio in the industry. This is in line with Ericsson’s goal to industrialize Open RAN. For advancing 5G performance Triple-band Massive MIMO FDD radio AIR 3284 (32T/32R) providing 2x higher downlink and 4x higher uplink capacity** compared to 4T/4R. Radio 4823 (4T/8R), boosting uplink performance (2x) with separate remote electrical tilt on the 2.6GHz frequency band to extend coverage or capacity based on the deployment choice. AIR 5343 for high-capacity and high-performing Fixed Wireless Access with macro deployment. Up to 1600 MHz total carrier bandwidth and 11 dB extended coverage.
