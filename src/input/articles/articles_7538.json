Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Arsenal fans have criticized Bukayo Saka for his performance in the club's 2-0 defeat to West Ham United.\nThe Gunners hosted the Hammers at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday, December 28, on Matchday 19 of the Premier League season. Tomas Soucek struck in the 13th minute, with the goal being given after a lengthy delay due to doubts over whether the ball went out of play.\nKonstantinos Mavropanos, playing against his former side, added a second for West Ham in the 55th minute. Said Benrahma won a penalty in stoppage time, but David Raya did well to deny the forward. However, it didn't matter as the visitors came away with all three points.\nSeveral players endured off-nights for Arsenal, who struggled to break down a disciplined West Ham side defending in numbers in and around the box. Among the hosts' underperformers was Saka, who completed none of his four dribbles, missed two big chances and lost possession 19 times.\nThis in turn saw him incur the wrath of Gooners on X (formerly Twitter), with one of them writing:\n\"Saka did absolutely nothing, all the Arsenal attackers needs to work on finishing #ARSWHU \" Expand Tweet Another tweeted that Saka's new haircut resembled that of Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford. Rashford has struggled so far this season, recording just two goals and five assists in 23 matches across competitions.\n\"Saka dyed his hair like Rashford now he plays like him, [Gabriel] Martinelli against a low block is [Antony], [Oleksandr] Zinchencko at fault for the last three conceded… Dare I say it, we actually missed [Kai] Havertz!,\" the fan wrote. Expand Tweet Here are some more fan reactions:\nExpand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Saka played all 90 minutes of Arsenal's contest against West Ham. He took nine shots, five of which were blocked, while three were on target and one hit the woodwork. The Englishman also won just five of his 15 duels and found a teammate with only two of his eight crosses.\nTo his credit, though, Saka recorded four key passes, created a key chance, won two fouls and made four tackles as well.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Brampton man charged with temple robberies in Canada Durham police identified the accused as 41-year-old Jagdish Pandher of Brampton, and he is facing charges for numerous offences. Canadian police has arrested one person in connection with a series of burglaries at temples in the province of Ontario in recent months. In a release on Thursday, Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS) identified the person as 41-year-old Jagdish Pandher, a resident of the town of Brampton in the Greater Toronto Area or GTA. He is facing charges for numerous offences and is being held for a bail hearing. [Click here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap) Pandher was also involved in another series of burglaries targeting places of worship last year. DRPS said a man was seen on security surveillance breaking into the Hindu temple on October 8 and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. The man was seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax. Investigators linked the same suspect to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the GTA. “Although these offences occurred at places of worship, they do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate,” the release noted. At least six Hindu temples were broken into in the province since this September. The temples included the Devi Mandir in Pickering, Sankat Mochan Mandir in Ajax and the Hindu Mandir Durham in Oshawa. The three temples in the GTA were the Chintpurni Temple in Brampton, which was targeted on September 9, Rameshwar Mandir in Caledon, robbed on September 18 and the Hindu Heritage Centre in Mississauga, on October 4. These burglaries follow a spate of similar incidents in the GTA in late 2021 and into early last year. There were at least 18 such break-ins. Four persons were arrested in March 2022 in connection with the burglaries that had caused concern within the Indo-Canadian community. On March 4, Peel Regional Police or PRP identified one of those arrested as Jagdish Pander. The others were Gursharnjeet Dhindsa, Parminder Gill and Gurdeep Pandher. While the majority of the places of worship robbed and vandalised were Hindu temples, they also included Jain temples and Sikh gurdwaras.

    "text": "The\nCleveland Browns have had a long history of terrible QB play, seeing a constant carousel under center in most seasons dating back to the turn of the century.\nThursday night, fans will have a chance to put those bad memories behind them and look to ahead to the future.\nTeam sponsor\nDUDE Wipes is offering an awesome opportunity ahead of the Cleveland’s Thursday Night Football matchup against the Jets.\nBefore kickoff, Browns fans can swap their past quarterback jerseys for a brand new one.\nTo celebrate amazing\n[@browns]QB play this season and our presenting sponsorship of the team’s white unis, fans can bring an old jersey of any Browns QB from ’99-’21 and we’ll swap it out for a new white jersey at the stadium ahead of TNF. DUDE Wipes loves your Browns! [pic.twitter.com/mpNOGllmjo]\n— DUDE Wipes (@DUDEwipes)\n[December 27, 2023]\nThe post notes that QB jerseys from the 1999 season through the 2021 campaign will be accepted.\nThat should lend plenty of options.\nWe’ve all seen the jerseys containing a long list of tape on the back as fans cross out the passer from the year prior and replace with the next man up. In Cleveland’s case, it’s a very, very long list consisting of names like Bruce Gradkowski, Jason Campbell, Johnny Manziel, and Ken Dorsey.\nIt’s 37 names long, to be exact.\nWho’s next on the everlasting Browns QB jersey?\n[pic.twitter.com/4WUSk0glLQ]\n— Ravens Realest 🐦⬛ (@Ravens_Realest)\n[March 17, 2022]\nPrior to the 2023 season, the\nnumber sat at 34 with Deshaun Watson looking to take over for his second year. An injury led to three newcomers joining the lengthy catalog.\nPJ Walker, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, and now, Joe Flacco, have all landed starts this year.\nDespite the rotation, Cleveland is 10-5 and playoff bound should they finish out the season strong.\nDUDE Wipes teased a jersey partnership with the organization this offseason, seeing the team rock slick white uniforms for a Week 2 meeting with division rival Pittsburgh.\nThe jokes wrote themselves after that initial announcement, considering the brand manufactures unscented flushable wet wipes, with naturally soothing aloe vera and vitamin E for maximum comfort and cleanliness, claiming “billions of butts wiped.”\nThe company is continuing its play on the white jerseys with this latest promotion, and fans are pumped!\n“Trading in an old Browns QB jersey for a Joe Flacco jersey is true sickos behavior that must be commended.”\n“I have 14 former Browns QB jerseys. Is there a limit?!”\n“The price on the secondary market for old Browns QB jerseys is about to skyrocket.”\nIt sounds like there will be a solid turnout for the pregame event, and we should see a number of new white tops in the crowd Thursday night.",
