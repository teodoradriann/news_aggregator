But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "Quelques régions du Québec ont connu leur première neige samedi. • À lire aussi: Voici à quel moment vous pourriez recevoir de la neige C’est le cas de la réserve faunique des Laurentides, entre le Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean et la ville de Québec, où on prévoyait de 2 à 4 centimètres au cours de la journée. Le journaliste de TVA Alex Martin a appris à ses dépens que l’hiver était en quelque sorte déjà arrivé dans ce secteur. Sur la route 175, à seulement une trentaine de minutes de Saguenay, des accumulations de neige étaient déjà visibles en matinée. Des équipes de Transports Québec ont été déployées pour répandre de l’abrasif sur la chaussée. Les conditions routières sont d’ailleurs difficiles dans la réserve faunique des Laurentides en raison des vents, de la poudrerie et de la présence de glace au sol. Alex Martin, qui devait se rendre à Québec, a dû rebrousser chemin par mesure de sécurité. Celui-ci a aperçu trois voitures stationnées dans la voie d’accotement. En cette mi-octobre, plusieurs Québécois ont encore leurs pneus d’hiver installés sur leur véhicule, ce qui risque de compliquer les déplacements dans les régions qui connaissent déjà leur première neige. Voici à quel moment votre région pourrait recevoir ses premières traces de neige : Montréal: 27 octobre Québec: 21 octobre Sherbrooke : 29 octobre Mont-Joli : 22 octobre Sept-Îles : 22 octobre",

Marta Rovira ha entrado ya en Cataluña desde la frontera francesa que da acceso a La Jonquera (Girona) tras más de seis años residiendo en Suiza huida de la justicia española por el procés, así como el diputado Rubén Wagensberg; el vicepresidente primero de Òmnium Cultural, Oleguer Serra; el empresario Josep Campmajó y el periodista Jesús Rodríguez. \"Con exiliados, encarcelados y perseguidos no se puede hacer política en igualdad de condiciones. Esto afecta a la democracia, y mientras dure la represión política no existirá ninguna normalidad posible\", ha añadido Puigdemont en X. El expresidente de la Generalitat, que se encuentra en Bruselas (Bélgica) desde otoño de 2017, todavía no puede regresar a Cataluña con garantías de no ser detenido después de que el Tribunal Supremo haya decidido no aplicarle la ley de amnistía, si bien ha asegurado que estará presente en el primer debate de investidura que se celebre en el Parlament. A pesar del regreso de Rovira, Puigdemont considera que el independentismo todavía está \"lejos\" de tener \"las condiciones que permitan hacer política con normalidad\". \"Que de alguna manera podáis recuperar los años y los meses que os han robado, y que nos pongamos a trabajar lo más rápido posible. Porque hay mucho trabajo pendiente\", ha expresado. Envía tu noticia a: [participa@andaluciainformacion.es](mailto:participa@andaluciainformacion.es)",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#6](c6#c-6) El sol tiene, entre otros, un ciclo de actividad de 11 años aproximadamente en el que pasa de una actividad minima a una máxima. Ahora estamos en actividad máxima. Aparte de eso las auroras son provocadas por una eyección de masa coronal, pero estas eyecciones (llamadas CME) han de ir dirigidas a la tierra para que aparezcan las auroras, y muchas veces no vienen en nuestra dirección o nos dan de refilón.... y hay otros datos como la polaridad de la CME que tambien influye. En resumen: aparecen por una combinación de actividad solar y suerte que haga que vengan en nuestra dirección. Las dos de este año visibles desde españa no son algo excepcional, aunque si poco frecuente.\n[#19](c19#c-19) Es excepcional que se vean, porque cada once años hay unas pocas y tiene que coincidir que no haya nubes.\nLas de ayer, en Galicia:\n[#45](c45#c-45) Seguro que hay muchos más. P. ej. https://www.gciencia.com/medioambiental/o-ceo-galego-tinguese-de-rosa-asi-foi-a-nova-e-espectacular-aurora-boreal/\n[#40](c40#c-40) ayer a la 1:30 de la mañana iba por la A6 a la altura de Becerreá y se vieron increíbles.\n[#12](c12#c-12) y yo que pensaba que \"sin precendentes\" era sinónimo de excepcional...\n[#12](c12#c-12) desde mi humilde ignorancia, yo no recuerdo que en otros máximos solares haya habido auroras boreales tan al Sur.... hay registros de la última vez que ocurrió en España...?\n[#1](c1#c-1) o a Perro Sanxe, a Irene Montero, a rayos laser judios del espacio…\n[#1](c1#c-1) tranquilo ya lo achacan a la geoingieneria\n[#1](c1#c-1) ¿A qué se puede deber?. Realmente me choca que haya auroras boreales en estas latitudes, pero desconozco si es un hecho que ya se ha registrado en el pasado (en el pasado reciente, con registros rigurosos, no en escritos medievales y tal...). Si las auroras son provocadas por el sol, como tengo entendido, ¿qué ha cambiado en ciclo solar que las pueda estar provocando?.\nCuriosidad desde el desconocimiento.\n[#6](c6#c-6) No tiene porque ser solo el sol, el campo magnético de la tierra también cambia y fluctúa.\n[#1](c1#c-1) He visto suficientes películas de desastres como para saber que despues se viene el apocalipsis.\n[#1](c1#c-1) a mi lo que me escama es que el Friker Jiménez que ha dedicado en el pasado programas al \"peligro\" de las tormentas solares haya pasado de puntillas sobre este tema de las auroras boreales tan tan al Sur (cuando ocurrieron por primera vez hace unas semanas y supongo que ahora igual), cuando debería dedicarle un programa entero con ejjjjpertos y teorías a cascoporro... lo que me lleva a pensar que si ni siquiera los \"magufos oficiales\" le prestan atención, es que algo \"gordo\" viene y está aún más tapado que de costumbre....\n[#1](c1#c-1) Aquí lo tienes\n.\n[#7](c7#c-7) [#9](c9#c-9) [#24](c24#c-24) [#26](c26#c-26) \"Si es bien cierto que las auroras boreales en España en realidad no son improbables, lo que sí es una circunstancia que parece única es que en un mismo año hayamos disfrutado de dos espectáculos similares. \"\nParece que a lo que se refiere es que no hay precedentes de que hayan ocurrido dos veces en un mismo año... pero vete tú a saber...\n[#35](c35#c-35) Perdón, no entré a ver los tuits de la noticia. Hablaba por tuits que vi por la mañana al despertar. Con fotos y comentarios que hablaban de las 04:00... Pero bueno, era broma. Si sé a ciencia cierta que va a haber semejante espectáculo estoy despierto yo y hasta despierto a mi hija de cinco años para que lo vea.\n[#39](c39#c-39) Los cometas si no se ven muy bien a simple vista no me llaman tanto la atención. Recuerdo de joven, allá por el ¿96?, el Hale-Bopp que se veía a enorme a simple vista. Aquello si que era un espectáculo...\nY hará 10 años hice mis pinitos de astrofotografía con un telescopio Dobson y la reflex... cómo mola fotografiar tus propias galaxias\nIgual el problema es que ya no tengo telescopio y los últimos cometas los he visto con prismáticos. Sacar fotos del cometa con un telescopio+reflex igual si que era interesante... pero esa afición ya pasó. Ya no hay tiempo para ir de noche a pasar frío jejeje\n[#44](c44#c-44) [#17](c17#c-17) Pues las auroras estas que anuncian en España a simple vista creo nada de nada, que alguien me corrija, lo que es sin precedentes es tanta gente con buenas cámaras pudiendo hacer fotos al cielo y redes sociales, eso sí es un fenómeno nuevo\npor cierto este ha sido el máximo de esta madrugada donde algo residual ha podido llegar a estas latitutes, nada mal, este invierno el turismo en los paises nordicos están de suerte,\n[#17](c17#c-17) mmm... no.\n[#17](c17#c-17) No.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Antes comamos unos gambones al vapor.\n[#9](c9#c-9) a esto venía\nEn España lo tenemos todo para el turista. A partir del 2024 incluimos auroras boreales en el catálogo.\nEsto el Ministerio de Igualdad lo iguala rápido.\neso es culpa de los aviones que nos fumigan",
