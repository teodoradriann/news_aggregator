    "title": "The Best Pizza in the World Was Just Named—Here’s Where You Can Find It",
    "text": "By Nathan Hutsenpiller ,\n2 hours ago\nPizza will always be one of those foods that brings with it a ton of loaded opinions. It’s fairly easy to make, can be reimagined into dozens of different styles and has a cult following that will rival even the largest of fanbases. It’s not a bad thing that pizza is so popular; in fact, we prefer it to be that way. There are hundreds of pizza joints to choose from across the continental United States and we get the pleasure of trying them all anytime we are someplace new.\nWhile taking a road trip across America to sample countless slices of pizza sounds like a childhood dream come true, it's not necessarily in the cards for most of us. Thankfully, the professional pizza rankers at 50 Top Pizza have done the dirty work for us, narrowing down the top performing pizzerias around the world. And surprise, surprise, NYC holds court in the number one position above the rest.\nRelated: Yelp Just Ranked the 100 Best Pizza Spots in the Midwest, and the Winner Might Surprise You\nIt takes a lot of hard work and dedication to be recognized as having the best slice in the world, and Anthony Mangieri’s Una Pizza Napoletana definitely deserves its flowers. Located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mangieri’s shop sees itself finally landing in the top spot after spending 2023 and 2022 in second place.\nUna Pizza Napoletana is the sixth iteration of Mangieri’s pizzeria, placing focus on creating the perfect pizza by starting with a naturally-leavened crust. The pizzeria employs an “ever-changing mix of Italian flours, unrefined Sicilian sea salt and NYC water,” to create the crust of the pie before tossing it into a wood-fired oven to gain its perfect level of crispness.\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\"In a country always accustomed to putting everything on pizza, Anthony proposes only the purest tradition in toppings, with extraordinary quality ingredients. Marinara, Margherita, Cosacca, and a pizza that changes every day, based on market ingredients,” noted the awards website , “The dough nods to the contemporary, but is so personal that it probably cannot be classified, good, tasty, true, it has the aroma and flavor of pizza.\"\nAside from their win as the top pizza shop worldwide (with Italy and Japan taking up the other places in the top five), Una Pizza Napoletana also took home the top spot in the ranking for the best pizzerias in the United States —a position they've held for the past three years.\nThis may not come as much of a surprise, but New York also found itself taking up two positions in the top five and seven positions in the top 20. Ribalta , located in the heart of Manhattan's Union Square neighborhood, came in fourth place, while Don Antonio and Song’ E Napule found themselves in seventh and twentieth positions, respectively.\nSan Francisco’s noteworthy second place position was taken up by Tony’s Pizza Napoletana , which divides its pizza menu up by style. The popular San Fran pizza joint offers Neapolitan pizza, New York-style, Detroit-style, Sicilian or really any other style of pizza you are craving.\nRelated: The Viral Recipe That Has Us Rushing to the Store to Buy Pizza Dough\nView the original article to see embedded media.\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy finishes, however, comes from Philadelphia, in which Pizzeria Beddia snagged the third place position with no other sign of a Philly pizzeria showing up anywhere else on the list. Known to be the largest pizza spot in Pennsylvania, the Fishtown-born establishment boasts an indoor and outdoor dining situation and considers itself to be at the “top of the pizza quality movement” in the United States.\nIf your mouth is watering now just as much as ours is, you’ll want to take a gander at the full list here and start planning out your weekend immediately. Just be sure to save room for dessert though, because you know these pizza spots are going to have a tasty cannoli just waiting for your approval.\nUp Next:\nRelated: Sam's Club Is Selling a Super-Handy Slow Cooker Trio for $40, and Shoppers Say It's 'Perfect for the Holidays'\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "By Jo Nova\nAustralians are angry the BOM didn’t see the flooding rains coming\nWorse, we’re betting the nation on the BOM’s ability to predict the climate.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) tells Australians that record breaking extremes are getting worse because of our cars and our air-conditioners (that’s “\nThe State of the Climate“). But when the BOM can’t predict record breaking rain a month in advance, or even the day before, we know the BOM doesn’t understand what drives the climate.\nSomehow the BOM expect Australians to spend trillions and rearrange their economy based on their fifty year prophesies, but not to mind when “this summer” goes right off the rails.\nBack in September the BOM issued its El Nino alert, and Australians were told it would be a\n hot and dry and to prepare for a summer of bushfires. Farmer sold their lambs, and adjusted harvest accordingly.\nThis was the BOM solemn prediction in late October, for the very next month of rainfall\nAcross most of Australia the\nodds were only 20-40% of getting average rain.\nInstead this is what happened:\nAnd in December most of the country was predicted to have a fifty fifty chance of getting “average” rain.\nBut the real weather gods had another idea, and all the places under any shades of green below got somewhere from 100% to 300% of the average rainfall. The indigo and purple zones got even more.\nThis was a savage downpour — seven feet of rain in five days fell at one location:\nNo fewer than 12 locations across far north Queensland posted record rainfall totals.\nSome areas received a year’s rainfall in a single day, isolating towns, closing highways and leaving hundreds stranded by surging floodwaters. Black Mountain near Cooktown recorded a cumulative 2189mm over the five days, while Mossman South, an hour northwest of Cairns, had 1935mm.\nAs the Mayor of Douglas Shire said:\n“If this is so record-breaking, how did no one know this was going to happen … we need to have forecasts closer to what is going on.”\nThe BOM suddenly wants to absolve itself of liability\nPeople have noticed there is now a mandatory check box forcing users to agree to a legal disclaimer clearing the BOM of all liability:\nUsers of the BOM app now have to agree to a 699-word “terms and conditions” statement that includes “information at this app … may not be accurate, current or complete”.\n“To the maximum extent permitted by law, the bureau excludes any liability that may arise in connection with the BOM Weather app or any information or material presented therein or your access to or use of any of the same,’’ the bureau says in a “terms and conditions” statement that appears when a user attempts to download its app. —\nMackenzie Scott, The Australian\nThey know they are in trouble.\nI say the BOM can have immunity the same day Australians can also tick a box excluding ourselves from any and all costs, imposts and taxes related to any BOM predictions.\nThe Australian editors gives the BOM an escape valve it doesn’t deserve:\nTo be fair to the BOM, a hysterical and ill-informed media has allowed climate alarmism to infect reporting of what should be routine weather events.\nFor thirty years the Australian media has made hyperbolic scare stories about the weather while the BOM tacitly stood by and smiled. Where were they as the tenets of science were trashed, and critics were called “climate deniers”? If the BOM are victims of this hyperbole now, they reap what they sowed.\nThe BOM raised the stakes, and they don’t get to weasel out by saying\n“we used the best science” as if the best science wasn’t riddled with holes. If the science is good enough to throw away trillions of dollars, then the worst failures need a truckload of explanation.\nPredicting the weather is hard. We could forgive the BOM for getting a complex immature science wrong, but not when they also tell us it’s just simple physics, they’re absolutely sure, and there is no doubt they’re wrong (give us your money!).",
