    "text": "[Iran](/Subjects/00164-LAST-iran.htm) • https://www.zerohedge.com, by Tyler Durden [Iran Vows To Hit Back If US Strikes Target Its Soil; US Destroyer Comes Under Attack In Red Sea](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/iran-vows-hit-back-if-us-strikes-target-its-soil-us-destroyer-comes-under-attack-red) The Guardian reported Tuesday that a 'warning' over red lines has been issued via diplomatic channels. \"Iran has told the US via intermediaries that if it strikes Iranian soil directly, Tehran will itself hit back at American assets in the Middle East, drawing the two sides into a direct conflict,\" according to the report. The Islamic Republic remains on 'high alert' - while in Iraq one of the main Shia militias in Iraq which is believed responsible for the killing of the Americans, Kataib Hezbollah, [announced](https://www.rudaw.net/english/world/300120241) it is suspending all operations against US troops and bases in Iraq and Syria. \"We announce the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces,\" Kataib Hezbollah said in the statement. The group said it was motivated in large part because it did not want to cause \"embarrassment to the Iraqi government.\" The Iraqi government has lately clarified its stance that it wants to immediately see all US and Western coalition forces exit the country on a permanent basis. The announcement was immediately subject of much speculation. Is it a ploy to buy more time? Is it a last-ditch effort toward peace? Is it a deception? Most US media pundits looked upon it as meaningless. The US administration's response has essentially been that it's 'too late' and President Biden has already made the decision. Given no attack came in the overnight hours, there's a likelihood it will happen tonight. The Pentagon has indicated it is ignoring the Kataib Hezbollah message and that it won't change the US plans for a major response. Kataib Hezbollah has at no point taken credit for the Tower 22 attack, while US officials have said it has the \"footprint\" of the group linked to Iran. And more from Tehran officials...",

    "title": "\"Get out while you can\": Trish Regan asks Bill Belichick to break up with Jordon Hudson claiming the relationship is \"not quite right\"",
    "text": "Television personality Trish Regan recently advised Bill Belichick to get separated from Jordon Hudson in a new video shared on April 30, 2025.\nNotably, the news comes after Bill and Jordon were trending following the latter’s alleged interruption during Belichick’s interview on CBS Sunday Morning on April 27, 2025, where Hudson was not willing to allow host Tony Dokoupil to question anything about their relationship, including the time when they first met, as per Page Six.\nTrish Regan shared a video through her official account on X (formerly Twitter), where she began displaying a few clips where Bill and Jordon could be spotted together on various occasions. One of the clips included a moment from an interview where the host was heard asking Belichick:\n“You have Jordon right over there. Everybody in the world seems to be following this relationship. How did you guys meet?”\nHowever, Jordon Hudson responded to this question and said that she did not want to talk about the same. As soon as the clips stopped playing, Trish Regan said:\n“Is it me, or is this woman just a little bit scary? Bill, get out while you can. I know you think it’s cool. She’s like, 50 years younger, but there’s something not quite right.”\nHudson and Belichick first met in 2021 on a flight to Palm Beach. On June 14, 2024, TMZ reported that Belichick and Hudson are officially dating. By September 2024, Belichick starts appearing on Hudson’s Instagram.\nJordon Hudson and Bill Belichick: CBS interview controversy and more\nAccording to the New York Post, Jordon was present while Bill was giving his CBS interview. As mentioned, Hudson reportedly intervened when Belichick was questioned about their first meeting.\nMeanwhile, sources for TMZ claimed on April 28, 2025, that Jordon Hudson’s interruption allegedly led to a delay in the interview by around 30 minutes. Apart from that, Hudson reportedly interfered a few more times, including that she corrected Bill when he replied to the questions that were about football.\nAccording to Page Six, Dokoupil tried to end the interview with Bill as soon as possible since he was reportedly feeling frightened due to Jordon Hudson’s behavior on set. Furthermore, officials for CBS were allegedly trying to find a solution on how to broadcast the segment while they were editing the interview.\nAs per the latest update, Bill responded to everything that happened during the interview in an email sent to People magazine on Wednesday, April 30. He said in the statement that the conversation was a part of the promotion for his new book The Art of Winning – Lessons from My Life in Football.\nBelichick added that he spoke to his publicist at Simon & Schuster before the interview, saying that he would only address the details related to the book. He mentioned that “unrelated topics” were brought up during the conversation, and although he mentioned the same to Tony, things did not change. He further stated:\n“After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion. She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track.”\nAccording to Jordon Hudson’s LinkedIn profile, she is the CEO and founder of a company called Trouble Cub Enterprises. She completed her higher studies at Bridgewater State University.",

Céline Dion and Jean-Jacques Goldman, the exceptional singer and the (greatest) singer-songwriter. Diamond record in 1995 with nearly 4.5 million CDs sold, “D'eux”, Céline Dion's fifteenth album, written and produced by the Frenchman, remains the best-selling French-speaking album in the history of music.\nThe rest after this ad\nAfter a long convalescence, the Quebec singer found the strength to sing in 2024, first during the Paris Olympic Games ceremony on July 26, 2024, then on November 13, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to celebrate her friend Elie Saab . Two albums are in preparation. The first, in English, has been under construction for several months. “The idea is that she covers her greatest songs in duets with others,” we are told by those around her. All the music stars come to Las Vegas, it's quite easy to organize recording sessions there. » But nothing is organized at the moment.\nA single title\nOn the other hand, there is a second disc in preparation, this time in French. Jean-Jacques Goldman, the man behind “So that you still love me”, “If it was enough to love” or “Encore un soir”, was obviously requested. “They don’t need to see each other or talk to each other to understand each other. Jean-Jacques was always the one who best summed up Céline. It's hard to do without him. » He will only sign one track on this new album. There is no doubt that it will be a new hit. “So that you still love me” remains one of the flagship titles of her repertoire, which she still sang during her residency in Las Vegas in 2008.",

You're likely not alone as it has been miserably cloudy since before Christmas day.\nToronto had been in the dark for over two weeks before the sunshine finally graced a chilly January day on Thursday. Despite the sun however, early morning temperatures were accompanied by a brisk wind chill, bringing some of the coolest weather felt in weeks, as well.\nThe light at the end of the tunnel will be brief, with the weeks ahead expected to stay grey.\nBaron - Toronto cloud calendar - Jan4.jpg This streak of winter cloud cover isn't super unusual for Ontario, as December and January tend to be the cloudiest months of the year. But the persistent overcast skies and unusual foggy Christmas are making Thursday's splashes of sun certainly feel even more special.\nFriday may offer pops of sunshine as well, but the long range forecast has winter returning in a hurry, with more cloud cover and even snowfall for this weekend.\nBaron - Toronto hours of cloud cover - Jan4.jpg The short-lived sunny high pressure will be replaced by a strong stateside low. This storm will blast the U.S. Northeast in heavy snow, which may wind up clipping southern Ontario by Saturday.\nSnowfall totals are still uncertain at this time, but a few centimetres are certainly possible in Niagara, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and regions to the east.\nBaron - ON snow outlook - Jan4.jpg Beyond the weekend, Wednesday looks particularly active as well, with a Texas low that has its sights on the Great Lakes region. Cold Arctic air will move in next weekend, firing up the lake-effect snow machine once again.\nThese snowy signals do not favour much sunshine in the future, so definitely enjoy it while it lasts!\nBe sure to check back for the latest forecast updates across Ontario.\nTRENDING 1.

    "title": "被群嘲的文科生：如何呢？又能怎？|高考|本科|考研|理科生|理工科_网易订阅",
    "text": "又是一年高考季，也是一年毕业季。\n2025年，全国高考报名人数1335万人，高校毕业生规模预计达到1222万人。\n高考和毕业像是固定的循环轮回，一端连接着教育的梦想，一端承接着生活的重量。每年盛夏，新一批文科生走入考场，同样会有一届文科毕业生迎接生活的新起点。\n他们面临着同一种处境。张雪峰说“报新闻学就把孩子打晕”“文科都是服务业”，这些观点成为性价比时代的真理。就业难、天花板低、文科无用的群嘲论调压在文科生头上，回响在无数人的心里。\n从现实回报来看，文科生想要获得高薪工作，无疑更困难。但从具体的人出发，要允许一部分文科生想说，学文科，他们并不后悔。\n今年2月，复旦大学宣布文科招生压缩。5月的建校120周年大会上，新闻学院校友、光线传媒董事长王长田说：“我这一生都以复旦文科生为荣。”\n在这段文科失灵的低谷期里，沉默的文科生是大多数。对更多的人来说，他们没有站在行业金字塔的顶峰，没有进入复旦这样的名校，没有人人都看好的发展机会。\n但与其羡慕别人，文科生更想活出自己想要的人生。\n成为一名文科生，是翩翩自认精明的选择。\n在她跌宕起伏的故事里，读文科的关键词是“有用”。\n10年前，翩翩在山西高考，凭借文科高分考上了四川大学的国际经济与贸易专业。当初读文无关什么情怀，她的高中在模仿衡水中学，她也更看重结果，想用够得着的高分逃离小城。\n她习惯以“有没有用”的标准衡量事物。上大学后，出于对未来的打算和实用主义，她跟随主流建议选择商科，巧妙规避了纯文科专业。\n但在这个更有用的专业，不再拔尖的成绩和心理落差，不适应群逐竞赛与绩点的压抑环境，不喜欢群体的冷淡关系，让她选择休学一年。\n在喜欢和有用的天平之间，翩翩总是矛盾、摇摆。她尝试去旅行、打工换宿、考雅思来填补这段无用的空白，紧接着返校读书、找对口实习、按部就班拿到学位证。\n毕业后，她才发现自己喜欢讲故事，在成都跨行做起了剧本杀创作。比起继续深造或进大厂的其他同学，翩翩真正面临着月入3000多元的生存压力，创作不被市场认可的挫败感，还有始料未及的负债，推着她在人生低谷里缓慢深陷。\n翩翩总想过另外一种生活，与自己无限拉扯：“当我困难的时候，想过平静的生活，停下来又想要找点事做”。在休学前，她在朋友圈里发：“所有漂泊的人生都梦想着平静、童年、杜鹃花，正如所有平静的人生都幻想伏特加、乐队和醉生梦死”，这段话出自萨冈的《孤独的池塘》，是她命运的回响。\n翩翩考研成功后，在回家的飞机上拍摄\n于是她时隔3年重返校园，在辽宁大学攻读纯文的日本史专业。这个选择同样矛盾，她既抱着好拿文凭考公上岸的功利心，又说曾在剧本杀里写过中世纪的故事，对历史很感兴趣。\n10年后，文科就业依旧是热门话题。老师告诉她南方院校在裁撤历史系，同门的师兄师姐就业并不光明。她重新调整了自己对生活的期待，只要月薪5000块，能养活自己就行。\n成为一名文科生，是张琪的英雄主义。\n2016年，张琪在高一的分科考试里拿到全校第11名。出于对人文学科的喜欢，她不顾父母老师的劝阻，在地狱模式的高考大省毅然决然选择了文科。\n当时身边人都告诉她，学文科是赚不了钱的，只有“学好数理化，走遍天下都不怕”。在“理强文弱”的高中，老师们不止一次强调过，读理科更容易上个好大学，未来工作前景也更有保障。\n作为普通家庭出身的孩子，张琪明白此话不假，但还是拗不过自己的心：“别人的光彩跟我有什么关系？如果因为我选了想学的专业，生活就完蛋了，那只能证明能力不够。”\n那时她还不清楚，理科和文科之间有鄙视链，学历和院校之间有鄙视链，文科专业内部也有鄙视链。她只觉得各专业薪资差距和专业壁垒不算大，反正都赚不了大钱，不如图个自己喜欢。\n电视剧《白色橄榄树》\n于是她选择了一所985院校的新闻学专业，随着张雪峰和新闻学的争议发酵，张琪一度跌落鄙视链底部，时不时被“新闻学魅力时刻”的说法刺痛。她成了不少邻居口中的现实版“仲永”，家人对此闭口不谈，甚至不少亲戚一直误以为她在读法律，将来要去当律师。\n但张琪觉得自己很幸运，大学生活完整幸福，毕业校招也没那么艰难。或许是幸存者偏差，她和身边人的去处都还不错，没有人真的找不到工作，只是找不到理想的工作。\n在技术时代，每个人的选择和努力决定了各自的天花板和地板。张琪有一位土木工程转码农的研究生朋友，在深圳拿到了年包40万，升学复旦北大的同学都在进军大厂的产品经理。\n毕业后，工作的同学们多奔向北上广深，天各一方。有人去大厂做销售和运营岗，有人一次性上岸选调和事业编，在私企工作的同学有月入过万的，实在没offer的同学还能转身去做教培，待业的人们慢慢在朋友圈销声匿迹。\n作为其中的普通人，张琪很满意当下的生活。她的人生没有因为学文科而完蛋，因为“任何选择都不会导向一种无望的人生。”\n成为一名文科生，清茗没有更好的选择。\n2020年，清茗在高中分科时奔向政史地，又在3年后选择了影视系。\n电视剧《你好，旧时光》\n跟很多文科生一样，她既偏科又喜爱文字，一路纯文科读下来是自然而然的选择。清茗喜欢纯文字理论，想做怀旧主题的剧本，以此探索00后这代人的观念困惑，她说：“我身边所有的人都在焦虑。”\n这个来自湖南的女孩创作过一个剧本，里面的女主角无关爱情，展现出了一种群体性的焦虑、迷茫和悲伤：父母在其身上投入了巨大的教育资源，怀揣望女成凤的高期待，但她意识到自己一辈子都赚不到相应的钱来偿还父母，在绝望中走向自我毁灭。\n现实世界里，清茗在高三时上的一对一数学课，课时费是800元。后来高考的数学成绩并不理想，清茗说：“早知道也考不了多少分，就不要花那么多。”\n她还记得那时和同学讨论就业时的心情，蹲在墙根处的少年们想要窥见某种确定的未来。隔了两年，她当起了粉丝过万的文字博主，还是很难赚钱，只能当兴趣爱好。\n一路走来，焦虑是现实，不后悔也是真的。既然本来就没有更好的选择，她觉得不妨多享受一点思考带来的自由和快乐。\n“上一个文科生兴盛的时代还是宋朝。”\n这种说法，张琪不知道听了多少次，话里话外都是一种自嘲和无奈，在说社会风向顺势而变，以前是重文抑武，现在就是重理轻文。\n事实上，即便隔着千年历史，这种怀旧也是不成立的。北大历史系教授赵冬梅深耕宋史研究，她的回应更显分量：“事实上，哪怕那个美好的时代也未必全属于文科生。”宋朝或许是读书人的黄金时代，但他们和今日的文科生并不能画等号。\n曾经的宋朝文人不是死读书，他们学的是治国理政，同样要学技艺、办实事。跟如今细分难专的文科比起来，两者在教育体系和就业市场上遥隔千山万水。\n《千古风流人物 第3季》\n赵教授认为，AI时代反而对文科研究者的工作提出了更高的要求，如今的文科应该变得更重要：“我一贯不认为文科要养活很多人，文科要精，不需要很多人来做，但做的人要是真正优秀的人。”\n无论在哪个时代，凤毛麟角从来都是极少数，平凡努力的普通人才是大多数，他们的地位与时代处境、自我开拓息息相关。\n在2025年的人才市场上，新一代“文人”要面临的质疑是“大多数理科生能胜任文科生的岗位，倒过来就不行了”，这是信息时代工作者在竞争力上的搏杀。\n如今回望，文科的危机从来不是一朝一夕，一时一地的。\n今年高考，“文科生碎了”的词条高挂热搜，政治历史地理学科无一幸免，指向“文科难”。去年，各媒体纷纷报道“全球文科倒闭潮”，发问“文科生何去何从”，指出文科生源萎缩、专业裁撤、职场失意等种种困境。\n张琪清楚地记得前两年，大家就开始流行拍“粉领黑袍月薪3000”的照片，如果镜头转到黄领红袍，就会被追问“未来是不是亮得睁不开眼”，是非常直观的差距（粉领黑袍如今是一种自嘲，本指文科学士的毕业服，黄领红袍则指工科博士生的学位服）。\n张琪的抽象毕业照，表现出粉领黑袍的自嘲\n教育洗牌，全球文科迎来缩招。国外，哈佛大学取消众多历史系和文学系课程，英国肯特大学逐步淘汰文科课程，日韩一众大学停招文科专业，边缘学科首当其冲。\n在国内，复旦大学宣布文科缩招近一半，同时大幅增加新工科招生名额。西北大学、中科大、四川大学等裁撤文科专业，北大清华、上海交通大学、武汉大学等院校相继扩大理科的招生规模，尤其是AI与数字化等前沿学科。\n2019-2022年，经教育部审批，有1422个文科专业被撤销。2023年上半年，教育部撤销的925个本科专业里，公共事业管理、市场营销等文科专业位列前茅。\n这些既是对文科冗余的拨乱反正，也在支撑“文科衰落”的论调。与之对应的是，文科生的焦虑在飞速膨胀。对大多数人来说，就业是选择的第一导向，文科在此时意味着学历贬值、供需失衡、价值坍塌。\n在文科生的哀叹中，不难看出他们的痛苦：读了十几年书，受到人文学科滋养，渴望提供个人价值和社会贡献的人们，陷入了群体性的迷茫，走向自我价值感的缺失。\n对于文科的讨论和评判，已经超越了学科选择的范畴，成为一场关于社会理念的叩问。文科需要自证，学文科有什么意义，当文科生实不实用，教育回报的性价比如何？\n电视剧《凡人歌》\n但落到具体的人身上，文科生的命运或许没那么沉重。\n越过嘲笑声和不看好的李衡秋，想提供她的答案样本。2020年，李衡秋考入福建省一所二本院校的国际经济与贸易专业，两年后降转人文科学系，重新学起汉语言文学。\n她是一个感性的人。在江苏卷的3+2模式下，李衡秋在高中选修了政治和历史，当初为了就业学国贸，她并不快乐。直到有位老师对她说：“如果你真的考虑就业，那你读国贸跟读中文其实就差几百块钱，你没必要去为了这几百块钱浪费一生。”\n理想和现实总会在某个时刻产生碰撞。李衡秋想有更多时间去思考人生跟自己的意义，选择回到喜欢的专业。后来她发现生活与原本的想象差不多，读原专业的同学有部分仍在待业，自己做兼职月薪4000元，与朋友的收入持平。\n汉语言文学的就业前景并没有好到哪里去，但她在这里看到了生命的更多可能。学长姐们的去向五花八门：非遗传承人、娱乐圈经纪人、老师、游戏策划人，大家没有像小时候想象的那样改变世界，却创造了属于自己的美好生活。\n李衡秋的日子也很丰富，在厦门的近6年时间里，她凭借全职、兼职、实习赚到人生的第一个六位数。本科期间，她尝试了10种线上下的工种，最多能同时能打3份工。从科技公司的兼职公关到托管机构的晚辅老师，李衡秋不停歇地奔赴一场场体验。\n她在央媒分社做暑期实践，到旅行社和博物馆实习，给艺术中心当志愿者，也在路边发过传单，干过仓储打包和理货员，一点点把自己的人生简历打磨漂亮。\n工作之余，李衡秋带着表弟旅行\n有时候，她上午还在上班，中午就要打车回学校考试，然后继续回公司干活。身边的人都在忙着准备未来，但李衡秋感觉人生分外开阔，没有任何前途上的担忧。\n因为学校不够好，她曾被说可惜了这些履历，刚开始觉得不甘心，现在觉得都无所谓。李衡秋了解过的工作基本全军覆没：“就都那样， 4000 块钱该干嘛干嘛”。\n前年，有个公司开了9000元请她去做账号运营，工作每周997，要求起号后一手包办，既要策划文案又能剪辑拍摄。她的回应是“领导，这是三个人，这不是一个人”。\n明年毕业后，她想去西部当志愿者，顺便找个喜欢的地方生活。不用从事太光鲜亮丽的工作，包吃包住、月薪3000块，能保证有空出去旅游，离家人近一点，就足够了。\n对她来说，能过好自己的人生就够了，有空焦虑不如去晒晒太阳。\n李衡秋的实习工位，能看到海景\n2024年，内蒙古高考报名人数为21.8万，热热就是其中之一。\n社交媒体学历膨胀，她自嘲上了个“普通的211”，只算中等水平。从文科无用到理科天坑，焦虑被源源不断地制造，才大一的热热不可避免地受到影响。\n在财经类211读英语专业，热热没因为文科不好就业而遗憾，她想转入的汉语言或新闻专业，同时被称为文科就业的万金油和天坑。在这所弥漫着金融气息、利益导向潜移默化的财经院校，她想逆着大流到更少人选择的地方。\n读高中时，热热擅长的科目是数学，她并不是因为理工科不行才学文，而是出于想跟文字打交道的理想主义。但喜欢和职业是两码事，她也担心学了中文系会幻想破灭。\n因为很多文科专业杂而不精、壁垒不高，热热觉得不如从以前的评判体系跳出来，在本科教育里尝试其他可能性，多学习知识健全人格，提升综合素养。即便具体的知识会随着时间遗忘，思考方式和人文关怀会融进人格底色，成为人的一部分。\n电视剧《小巷人家》\n在她看来，现实里文科的对口工作大多不像理工科那样，能给人们带来即时、可视、丰厚的金钱回报，但社会一定需要有这样的职业存在去辅助整体运转。\n就算提前焦虑3年，她也并不后悔学文科：“核心不在于说文科或者理科，而是你个人的竞争力。就是如果你真的很强，不论学文科或学理都不会找不到工作。”\n张琪却觉得，隔开文科生和理科生的不是就业，不是文学素养和思维方式，而是内心的衡量尺度。她一直疑惑的是：“为什么大家只说文科生呢，难道理科生就不焦虑吗？”\n她认识的理科生，既有从小公司做起艰难创业的清华精英，也有双非毕业回家被催着相亲的所谓“失意者”。旁观着这些人面对缺钱催婚的焦虑，张琪实在没感觉到有什么不同，抛开名校光环和崇拜视角，大家都是普通人。\n张琪的表弟在双非一本读人工智能专业，早早就担心实习、就业和考研。在这个总和年薪百万挂钩的新兴行业，他被归于沉默的大多数，觉得不读研没前途，工作也未必好找。\n同样地，张琪并不认为文科生的人文素养就比理科生更高。还是从经验出发，有些学理科的朋友，反而更痴迷哲学理论和文学典籍，对事物的思考也相当深刻。\n所以她认为人和人之间的差别是具体的，而不是只分文理的。学历、薪资、能力、家境等因素，都是衡量一个人的标准，但每个人内心的衡量尺度不能一视同仁。\n《优秀的绵羊》里提出过这种核心困境：精英教育体系乃至整个高等教育系统，正在批量生产以外部奖赏衡量自我价值的人。若是习惯将别人的认可当成自我的意义，就会想要在工作和生活里全方位取胜，至于本心喜不喜欢，没人在意。\n《十三邀 第八季》\n一路读到文科硕士的小耶并不认可这种标准：“我并不追求成为一个非常有钱的人，我并不追求一定要月薪过万，能活就行了。还是自己开心最重要。”\n她在本科录取率倒数的四川读文科，从西南民族大学的本科读到暨南大学的硕士，终于走到了就业焦虑的关口。虽然经常和室友自嘲文科不行，但从别人嘴里说出来，小耶还是会不太高兴。\n小耶不想被套进别人规划的成功模板：必须进入一个好大学，必须有一个稳定的工作，要有一个美好的家庭。她觉得人的标准要由自己来定。\n经济基础决定上层建筑，5G时代的社会发展更需要前沿技术和高精尖人才，无法匹配需求的人自然难以吃到时代红利。这是很多文科生的现实写照。\n小耶不是不焦虑，只是没有一直焦虑。说不羡慕高薪是假的，但她向来很自洽，如果把工作比作“在泰尼克号上选座位”，也得选个合适的。\n以前在大厂实习，她所在的岗位日薪100多块，对比400块钱一天的开发算法岗着实有些心酸。她去看过学校组织的招聘会，文科生岗位很少，甚至薪资上限和理工科的下限持平。后来本科同学真的“考公考编、月薪三千”了，小耶也不着急，日子过得好不好，只有本人知道。\n学术论坛上的小耶，在台下吃香蕉\n对一部分人来说，即便是不那么赚钱的人生，也是值得一过的。他们在精神的避风港里安顿下来，同时不断思考如何给他人、给社会创造意义。\n因为越是物质丰富、精神焦虑的时刻，就越需要人文关怀的抚慰。而当下太多人的评价体系，只有金钱和报酬。持续下去，受到伤害的不止文科生，还有困在“搞钱”里，每一个受伤的内心。\n翩翩曾经勤工俭学，在沈阳九一八博物馆当讲解员。起初只因为学的是日本史，她觉得知识储备更对口，但做着做着，她感受到一种真正的情怀。\n五一期间人流量巨大，她每天要讲3-4场，身体已经疲惫，精神却非常亢奋。在历史和现实的呼应里，翩翩看到许多感动的瞬间：\n听到抗战故事和历史事实时，大家会流下眼泪；和讲解员合影的孩子，会主动敬上少先队员的队礼；结尾例行呼吁大家“不忘历史”后，有老人为显庄重，悄悄整理了衣领。\n“这种意义肯定没办法用功成名就来形容，因为我只是数千个讲解员中的一个，拿到工资也是非常少的，但它给我带来的力量真的不一样，”她说。\n电视剧《觉醒年代》\n部分参考资料：\n1、中央广电总台中国之声｜还能学文科吗？北大历史系教授这样说……\n2、浙江宣传｜文科何去何从\n3、后浪研究所｜全球文科倒闭潮来了？不，未来文科会越来越重要｜专访《优秀的绵羊》作者\n4、南风窗｜全球文科倒闭潮，来了\n5、商隐社｜全球文科大败局？\n图片来源：\n剧照、视频截图、受访者供图",

The 21-year-old cost Wolves a then club record £35million when he joined from Porto in 2020 and there were high expectations, but he has failed to make an impression in the Premier League and has had two loan spells away at Anderlecht and PSV Eindhoven. All parties hope the move to Scotland can kickstart the Portugal U21 international's career. Silva said: 'This first-half of the season things haven't gone my way at Wolves but now with this opportunity I want to give everything here. 'It is amazing, everyone knows I had other options and other clubs but when I saw the option of Rangers, I was very happy. It was my first option straight away because I want to win titles, to play at big clubs, to feel the pressure and to play in big competitions so I want to play for the fans and play with my teammates.'
