    "text": "2中國學生在韓偷拍軍事設施被捕 輿論質疑身分\n2名中國高中生日前因在京畿道第10戰鬥飛行團附近偷拍軍機遭捕，其中一人聲稱父親為中國公安，引發輿論對其身分質疑。調查當局指出，除軍機外，他們還拍攝了多處軍事設施及機場。\n這2名中國高中生3月18日從仁川國際機場入境韓國，之後便帶著裝有望遠鏡的相機及手機前往韓美軍事設施及各主要國際機場拍攝。據當局調查，他們拍攝了大量水原、烏山、平澤、清州等地的空軍基地，以及仁川、金浦、濟州機場的照片。\n2人之後在同月21日下午於水原的戰鬥飛行團基地附近以相機及手機拍攝軍機而遭警方逮捕。據韓媒報導，其中一人在調查中表示自己的父親是中國公安，部分媒體因此質疑這2人是否真是學生。\n聲稱父親為公安的A某除這次外，去年下半年及今年初都曾入境韓國，每次滯留約4到5天；另一名B某則是在去年下半年，曾與A某同行入境韓國，同樣滯留4到5天。\n對於拍攝軍機等照片的動機，2人表示是因為平時的興趣就是拍飛機，警方仍在對此進行調查。據稱，這2人光是拍攝軍機起降的照片就拍了100多張。\n韓國在過去一年內數次發現中國人偷拍國內重要設施或竊取情報，包括去年6月3名中國留學生在釜山港拍攝美軍航空母艦；同年11月1名中國人以無人機拍攝韓國國家情報院；今年1月有中國觀光客被發現利用無人機拍攝濟州國際機場；上月29日則發現一名中國人偽裝成軍人企圖引誘韓國現役軍人洩漏軍事機密。\n不過，由於韓國現行間諜法適用範圍僅限於「敵國（北韓）」，上述案件皆不適用，僅涉嫌違反軍事基地及軍事設施保護法，與可能處死刑或無期徒刑及7年以上徒刑的間諜法不同，違反軍事基地及軍事設施保護法，最高處3年以下徒刑或3000萬韓元（約2萬美元）以下罰金。\n這類事件頻發也引發韓國社會對相關法律及罰則的關注，但將間諜法擴大適用範圍的法案目前仍未能通過國會審議。",

    "text": "MULTAN (Monitoring Desk): Babar Azam’s unbeaten century, followed by a combined bowling effort led Stallions to a massive victory over Dolphins in the seventh match of the Champions One-Day Cup here at Iqbal Stadium on Thursday.\nSet to chase 272, the Dolphins’ batting unit skittled for a meagre 97 in 25 overs.\nThe Dolphins found themselves in a state of bother right from the start as they lost their opener Mohammad Huraira (0) on just the second delivery of the innings.\nThe wickets kept tumbling while experienced opener Sahibzada Farhan stood firm on the other hand.\nFarhan’s retaliation finally ended in the 16th over as he faltered against Abrar Ahmed. He remained the top-scorer for the Dolphins with a gutsy 32 off 36 balls with the help of six boundaries.\nBesides Farhan, Asif Ali (21) was the other Dolphins batter to offer some resistance against a disciplined Stallions bowling attack while the rest failed.\nJahandad Khan and Mehran Mumtaz bagged three wickets each for the Stallions while Abrar and Haris Rauf took two each.\nStallions’ captain Mohammad Haris’ decision to bat first after winning the toss, turned out beneficial for his team as they amassed a commendable total of 271/7 in the allotted overs.\nOpening batters Yasir Khan and Shan Masood gave Stallions a head start with a 76-run stand, culminating with the latter’s dismissal in the 13th over.\nMasood scored a brisk 34 off 36 deliveries with the help of three boundaries.\nWith Masood’s dismissal, Babar Azam came out to Bat at No.3 and joined Yasir Khan.\nThe duo, however, shared a brief partnership, which yielded only 17 runs as Dolphins skipper Saud Shakeel trapped Yasir lbw on the first delivery of the 17th over.\nThe opening batter fell agonizingly short of his well-deserved half-century, scoring 46 off 58 deliveries and hit five boundaries.\nBabar was then involved in an anchoring third-wicket partnership with Tayyab Tahir. The pair added 57 runs to the Stallions’ total until Tahir fell victim to Qasim Akram in the 30th over.\nTahir scored a cautious 33 off 49 deliveries with the help of four fours.\nFollowing Tahir’s dismissal, the Stallions began to lose wickets at regular intervals but Babar Azam held his ground firm and kept the scoreboard ticking single-handedly.\nThe star batter eventually reached his century on the penultimate delivery of the innings when he hit Mir Hamza for a four.\nHe ran for a couple on the final delivery of the Stallions’ innings and thus remained unbeaten with 100-ball 104, laced up with seven fours and three sixes.\nFor the Dolphins, Hamza, Qasim, Saud, Faheem Ashraf, Abbas Afridi and Sufiyan Muqeem made one scalp each.\nFor the unversed, the Dolphins are yet to win a game in the ongoing Champions One-Day Cup and are at the bottom of the standings with zero points while the Stallions are at third position with 14 points.",

    "text": "PORTLAND Ore. (KPTV) - The Portland Police Bureau is working to identify a pair of porch pirates who stole drone equipment from a Southwest Portland home.\nA Portland couple was expecting a package to be delivered to their home near Multnomah Village on Wednesday. However, they never received it.\nOn Thursday, when they checked their Arlo security camera footage, they saw that a package had been delivered by DHL on Wednesday.\nLater in the footage, a man is seen stealing a box from their front door.\n“You live in a place that’s home, and someone kind of bursts that bubble of safety and takes what belongs to you,” the couple said.\nAnother Arlo camera captures the moments before and after the theft. The same man and another individual are seen in a black sedan in front of their driveway. The man hops out of the vehicle and walks toward the family’s home, while another individual in a gray hoodie steals an Amazon package from a neighbor.\nSEE ALSO:\nThe search for an armed robbery suspect in the Kenton neighborhood had ended and a shelter-in-place order has been lifted, according to the Portland Police Bure Both thieves throw the stolen packages into the trunk of the sedan and drive away from the neighborhood.\nAccording to the couple, their neighbor had shower items and a shoe rack stolen.\nThe couple distributes components for the drone industry. They said that inside their package were customized parts for specialized drones meant for mission-critical projects for customers like utilities, forest fire management, and the U.S. Department of Defense.\n“Replacing the stolen items is not simple and could delay mission-critical projects that are intended for the protection of infrastructure and public safety,” one of them said.\nBecause of the unique nature of the items, the couple believes it would be easy to detect them if they showed up on the “used market.”\nAnyone with information about the suspects is encouraged to contact the Portland Police Bureau.\nCopyright 2025 KPTV-KPDX.

    "title": "Delivery of the CMA CGM MERMAID: First ship in a series of 10 container ships with a unique design in the world for better energy performance | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",
    "text": "The CMA CGM Group, a global player in maritime, land, air, and logistics solutions, takes delivery of the CMA CGM MERMAID, the first ship in a series of 10 new 2,000 TEU container ships powered by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), which will be progressively deployed in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe.\nThese new container ships, with an original design aimed at improving their energy efficiency and environmental performance, will join the CMA CGM fleet of around 620 vessels, including more than 30 already powered by alternative energies. These ships will emit up to -20% CO2 compared to a similar-sized ship with a conventional maritime fuel design (very low sulfur oil).\nThis delivery is part of CMA CGM’s fleet renewal program, in which the Group has invested more than $15 billion. It brings the Group one step closer to meeting its objective of Net Zero Carbon by 2050. By 2028, nearly 120 ships will be powered by low-carbon energies.\nA new generation of container ships, the result of cooperation between industry players. These ships, with a different line and architecture from conventional container ships, were designed in close collaboration with Chantiers de l’Atlantique, a French company located in Saint-Nazaire and globally recognized for its ship design and construction expertise.\nThe Danish engineering firm Odense Marine Technique (OMT) further converted the concept into an industrial prototype\nCMA CGM entrusted the construction of the ships to Hyundai Mipo Dockyard (HMD), located in South Korea. Number one in the world for performance, the shipyard manages every stage of container ship assembly.\nFinally, GTT, a French company and expert in technologies for the maritime transport and storage of liquefied natural gas, worked closely on the project for the design and conception of the gas chain and storage tank with total capacity of 1,053 m3.\nThis close collaboration between the shipowner, engineering firm, equipment supplier, and world-renowned manufacturer has has provided a concrete response to the need for innovation in naval architecture and has given rise to a new model of container ship, with profoundly renewed profile and technical characteristics.\nProportions and technologies adapted for better energy performance\nDetermined to optimize energy efficiency in all its activities, CMA CGM decided to resize this new series of ships. One of the original characteristics of the design is the ratio of 204.29 m long to 29.6 m wide to improve the ships’ hydrodynamic and aerodynamic performance.\nThey are also the first ships in the CMA CGM fleet with superstructures at the front. Thus, placed at the front, the bridge and accommodations ensure better aerodynamic performance and higher loading capacity compared to a conventional architecture.\nA new, almost inverted straight bow with an integrated bow bulb also offers better hydrodynamic performance to reduce fuel consumption by 15% per trip.\nAn on-board energy mix to reduce the carbon footprint\nThese ships are powered by LNG, a lower-carbon energy source than conventional fuel, which reduces sulfur oxide emissions by 99%, nitrogen oxide emissions by 92%, and fine particles by 91%. When cooled to -161°C, LNG powers a 12-megawatt MAN engine. These dual-fuel ships can also carry biogas (-67% eq. CO2) produced from bio-waste and are convertible to e-methane (-85% eq. CO2) produced from decarbonized hydrogen.\nThe 10 new container ships will also be equipped with an alternator coupled to the main propulsion engine, which will provide the energy needed to power the onboard electrical installations once at sea.\nThe latest outstanding innovation in this new generation of container ships is one of the most powerful fuel cells aboard a ship. It is on track to be mounted on the last of the series which is scheduled for delivery in January 2025. As the fuel cell is powered by hydrogen with an energy capacity of 1MW, this ship will have zero emissions when berthed.\nA model with abundant technologies designed to maximize energy efficiency and environmental performance, the ships are finally also more comfortable and pleasant for their crew with modern interiors and booths.\nA new range of feeders to serve Northern Europe and the Intra-Mediterranean\nDelivered progressively between February 2024 and January 2025, the ten new vessels will transport goods over short distances, mainly in Northern Europe and the Mediterranean.\nBetween April and July, six of the series will join the Intra-Northern-Europe line to serve the Baltic and Scandinavian ports from the hubs of Hamburg and Bremerhaven. Four other ships will join the Intra-Mediterranean line between the end of September and the end of November.\nCapable of carrying 45’ containers which can be loaded on trailers, these ships offer a more energy-efficient alternative to road transport in Europe and the Mediterranean region.\nThe CMA CGM MERMAID will embark on its voyage to Northern Europe from Busan in South Korea.\nSource: CMA CGM\n2024-02-16 hellenicshippingnews...",
