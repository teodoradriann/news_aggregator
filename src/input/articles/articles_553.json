    "title": "Texas judge sets trial date over school's suspension of student for dreadlocks - ABC News",
    "text": "Texas judge sets trial date over school's suspension of student for dreadlocks The teen's family says that the school district is violating the CROWN Act. A judge has ordered a trial to take place and determine if a school district can continue penalizing a Black Texas high school student for the length of his dreadlocks which would run afoul of the state's CROWN Act, a law which protects from hair discrimination. The judge ruled on Wednesday that the trial is set to take place on Feb. 22. which will determine if the Barbers Hill Independent School District (BHISD) violated Texas's CROWN Act by putting Darryl George on academic punishment due to his hair. Darryl George, 18, has been banned by BHISD from attending regular classes at Barbers Hill High School in Mont Belvieu. He has been directed to in-school suspension and an off-site disciplinary program since Aug. 31, 2023, according to his mother Darresha George. The school claimed that the length of his dreadlocks violated their dress and grooming code . Darryl George's dreadlocks are braided and wrapped up on top of his head. The CROWN Act, which stands for \"Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair,\" was passed with a bipartisan vote in the Texas legislature and signed into law by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last May. \"… being an American requires conformity with the positive benefit of unity, and being a part of something bigger than yourself,\" Greg Poole, the superintendent of Barbers Hill ISD, said through a full-page, paid ad in the Houston Chronicle on Jan. 14. Poole told ABC News in a statement that Barbers Hill dress code was not in violation of the CROWN Act which Texas enacted last September. \"The CROWN Act was meant to allow braids, locs or twists, which the district has always allowed. The law was never intended to allow unlimited student expression,\" Poole said in a statement. Candice Matthews, a local activist close to the family, criticized Poole for his stance. \"This is very dangerous and he [BHISD Superintendent Greg Poole] has no business having any type of oversight of children and their educational journey,\" Matthews told ABC News in part through a statement. The school district told ABC News in a statement in September they filed the lawsuit through the judicial system of Texas to help them clarify the terms of the CROWN Act and whether the length of hair is a factor in the law. \"Any student dress or grooming policy adopted by a school district, including a student dress or grooming policy for any extracurricular activity, may not discriminate against a hair texture or protective hairstyle commonly or historically associated with race,\" according to the CROWN Act. \"'Protective hairstyle' includes braids, locks and twists.'\" Darryl George's family filed a federal lawsuit in September against Abbott and the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton for allegedly not enforcing the state's CROWN Act. The family alleges in the complaint that Darryl George has been subjected to \"improper discipline and abrogation of both his Constitutional and state rights,\" as a result of the governor's and the AG's failure to provide equal protection and due process under the law for the plaintiffs; ensuring school districts and schools refrain from discrimination based on race and sex and from using the CROWN Act of Texas to cause outright race and discrimination, according to a copy of the lawsuit ABC News obtained. Abbott and Paxton did not respond to ABC News' request for comment at the time of the lawsuit. \"I don't know how to be any more clear to the people, like Superintendent Poole, who believe everyone must conform to their own personal notions of acceptable appearance. Black people cannot control the way our hair grows out of our heads,\" Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, NJ-12, who introduced a federal version of the CROWN Act to Congress, told ABC News in a statement. \"The toll this kind of blatant discrimination takes on Black people is both psychological and economic, as hair discrimination occurs not only at schools, but in workplaces as well.\"",

A due giorni dal mio articolo in cui evidenziavo che per non disturbare i mercati gli attentati iniziavano e si concludevano nell’arco di un weekend, ecco che arriva la sonora smentita. La breaking news sembra grave. Le borse aprono con un mini panic selling , l’Europa perde poco più di un punto e i futures di Wall Street non sono belli, ci sarebbe la trimestrale di Netflix che non è piaciuta, ma in quei momenti nessuno se lo ricorda. Sembra l’incipit di un black friday , ma con il passare delle ore il sole si alza in cielo e fa maggiore luce sulla situazione che con il recupero dei prezzi sembra sempre meno preoccupante. I prezzi condizionano le notizie, di tanto in tanto ve lo ricordo. E se inizialmente la ritorsione di Israele sembra l’inizio della temuta escalation, il recupero delle borse fino a quasi l’azzeramento delle perdite, fa addirittura dubitare che sia veramente Israele l’autore dell'attacco.\nCatastrofisti, rassegnatevi: spread giù e Borsa su, i numeri che li lasciano senza argomenti",

Tras el fuerte aguacero registrado en la tarde de este jueves, más de 200 viviendas registraron afectaciones en al menos cinco sectores del municipio de Soledad. Lea: Reportan afectaciones por lluvias en viviendas de Villa Carmen, Soledad Lea: Activan plan de atención de riesgos tras fuerte aguacero en Soledad El reporte fue entregado por el Cuerpo de Bomberos del municipio, que indicó que hubo inundaciones en los sectores de Villa Carmen, Nuevo Horizonte, Las Colonias y Don Bosco, entre otros. “Se está planificando que este viernes se puedan visitar los barrios afectados por inundaciones. La idea es verificar las condiciones en que quedaron tras el aumento del caudal y el desbordamiento de varios arroyos”, sostuvo Blas Araújo, miembro del cuerpo de socorro. Lea: Voraz incendio generó alerta en el barrio Los Almendros, Soledad Expuso que en algunos sectores se registran desbordamiento de los arroyos debido a la acumulación de basuras: “Desafortunadamente se afectan las viviendas más bajas. Esas personas tuvieron daños en sus enseres, pero no hay registro de heridos o desaparecidos”. Agregó que el Cuerpo de Bomberos atendió otras emergencias en los barrios Los Almendros, Ciudadela Metropolitana, La Arboleda, Primero de Mayo y Don Bosco, entre otros. El Comité Local de Prevención y Atención de Riesgos en el municipio de Soledad activo un plan de contingencia para establecer los alcances de las emergencias que fueron generadas por un fuerte aguacero registrado este jueves. De acuerdo con la Alcaldía, se recibieron reportes de inundaciones en distintos sectores del municipio. Por esa razón, personal de la Defensa Civil viene adelantando los correspondientes censos con el acompañamiento del Cuerpo de Bomberos Voluntarios y de la Policía Nacional. La Alcaldía reiteró el llamado a la comunidad para adoptar medidas de prevención debido al inicio de la temporada de lluvias. Además, expuso que el territorio nacional se encuentra preparando para enfrentar el fenómeno de La Niña. Convierta a El Heraldo en su fuente de noticias",

    "text": "这段时间，高考分数陆续公布。 河北省尤其恐怖600+以上考生多达2万以上，也就是说，在河北的考生，就算考到600+，也可能连211都考不上。\n当然，不是每个省份都这样。 600+的分数，在其他地区还是很香的。尤其是690+，这个成绩虽然不能说会被清北连夜上门抢人。\n但想要走个清北复交，还是轻轻松松。 但有些考生虽然考试成绩出来了，也确实是“69+”，却没能得到网友的祝福，反而成了笑话，这是怎么回事呢？\n家长以为女儿高考成绩“69+”，身份证拿开后，却成了全网的笑话\n高考查成绩的时候， 真的能看出来不同考生之间的性格差异。有的考生丝毫没有情绪波动，点开就看，看完就算，直接下一步。\n平静的好像这个分数不是他自己考出来的， 好像之前十几年的努力，也不是他自己付出的一样。\n有的同学则比较紧张，在家长的陪同下 ，小心翼翼的点开，查看总成绩，查看各科成绩，全程心跳砰砰砰，很有高考查分的紧张氛围。\n还有一种就比较奇葩了，那就是开盲盒 。先点开分数，谁都不看。然后盖上，一点一点的移动遮挡物，看对应的分数。\n这名考生就是这样闹出来的笑话 ，在前面科目对应的分数后面，都是1开头，总分的位置是6开头。\n那一瞬间，大家都很激动。 网友的心也跟着提起来了，很乐意见证学霸破茧成蝶的时刻。再往后看，越来越紧张，总成绩从6开到了9。\n690+的成绩，无论在什么地方，都是神一样的存在。 清华北大随便挑，正在查成绩的家长也开始欢呼雀跃，准备庆祝。\n也有迫不及待的家长，催促赶紧开，正在录像呢 。结果身份证移开之后发现，什么690+，就是69分。\n其他科目的成绩也不是100+，而是10+。 总分60多的成绩，大起大落的心态，很难让人怀疑，这不是在演戏。怎么自己家学生什么水平心里没数？还期待690+？\n笔者把这个当成一个玩笑看，感觉还不错。 刚好可以缓解刚刚考试出成绩的紧张感，也给各位考生放松一下。\n但放松的时间不要太长， 因为我们还有更重要的事情要做。尤其是对于成绩不是很理想的同学。\n成绩不理想，就今早想办法\n那些成绩不理想，还希望未来有一份安稳工作的同学们。 在选择学校的时候，就要更加用心。而且，专业十分重要。\n想要以后的路好走，就给我死磕带有这样字眼的学校， 什么“某某铁道，或者铁路职业学院”，“某某电力职业技术学院”，“某某航空职业技术学院”等等。\n包括船舶，中医，石油，化工，水利第方向， 都是未来就业情况比较明朗的专业。千万不要觉得专科院校上不得台面，有时候他们未来的出路，比本科都要好。\n如果条件允许的情况下，可以选择3+2教育。 什么意思呢？就是3年大专，只要表现得好，学习能跟上节奏的话，可以直接升到相对应的本科，免去专升本的考试。\n这样做有一点好处，就是虽然比正常本科多读了1年 。但对自身分数要求没有那么高，而且毕业的时候，毕业证和正常统考升本的学生一样。\n找工作的时候只要自己不说，用人单位根本看不出来 。所以各位同学们，查分之后，抓紧时间对应自己的分数线，给自己找一所心仪的院校吧。\n（图片均来源于网络，如若侵权请联系删除）\n声明：个人原创，仅供参考",

    "text": "El alcalde de San Nicolás, Daniel Carrillo, criticó la decisión del gobernador de Nuevo León, Samuel García Sepúlveda, de no entregar el presupuesto para el año 2024. Calificando este acto como una irresponsabilidad, el edil señaló que la inacción del mandatario afecta a organismos autónomos, así como a los poderes legislativo y judicial, impactando negativamente a todo el estado. Carrillo subrayó que el presupuesto del estado no pertenece exclusivamente al Ejecutivo, sino que es para beneficio de todo Nuevo León, abarcando organismos, municipios y los tres poderes. El alcalde expresó su descontento ante la falta de entrega del presupuesto y consideró que esto revela la verdadera naturaleza del gobernador. En relación al fondo de 2 mil 500 millones de pesos destinado a alcaldes del PRI y el PAN, el alcalde de San Nicolás informó que los ediles han agotado todos los recursos legales disponibles para su recepción y que esperan que se tomen decisiones al respecto en enero del próximo año. En cuanto a la posibilidad de desacato por parte del gobierno estatal, Carrillo advirtió que, de no cumplir con la ley, esto podría resultar en consecuencias legales, incluso mencionando la posibilidad de cárcel para aquellos que no ejecuten la entrega de los recursos. A pesar de las tensiones, Daniel Carrillo manifestó la disposición de los alcaldes para dialogar con el gobernador Samuel García, siempre y cuando exista una invitación formal al diálogo por parte del mandatario estatal.",

Using data from Estonia, Spain and the UK including 20 million patients, the first pieces of work were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine and Heart.\nBoth studies showed that COVID-19 vaccination reduced the risk of long COVID and post-acute complications. The analyses were done using federated analytics (analysis that is performed on multiple, often geographically, separated datasets) on the the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM).\nThe research team in Norway led by Professor Hedvig Nordeng and Dr. Nhung Trinh have recently mapped data from several nationwide linked health registries covering primary and secondary care events, vaccinations, and communicable disease notifications into OMOP CDM as part of the European Health Data and Evidence Network. They applied the publicly available scripts and successfully replicated the findings from Estonia, Spain and UK.\nCOVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of developing long COVID symptoms across all study cohorts by 36%. Although post COVID-19 thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications were rare, they also found a\nreduced risk for post-COVID ATE (arterial thrombosis) during the acute phase and for heart failure and VTE ( venous thromboembolism) during the post-acute phases in older people following vaccination.\nDr. Jödicke commented, \"We are very excited to see that the Norwegian vaccine effectiveness results are supporting our previous findings of a reduction in risk of long COVID, and post-COVID cardiac and thromboembolic complications.\"\nTrinh, Researcher at PharmaSafe research group, at the University of Oslo, said, \"We are glad that our study provides reassuring evidence on the COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness. I really believe that OMOP Common Data Model and federated analytics are the future of real-world evidence research. Extensive efforts are required at the harmonization phase but once the data are in OMOP format, several studies relying on multinational data can be conducted very efficiently.\"\nProfessor Alhambra added, \"This work demonstrates the value of federated analytics based on the OMOP CDM to make real-world evidence reliable and reproducible.\"\nNordeng, head of the Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety research group at the University of Oslo, concurs, \"This study showcases the efficiency of our data analytical pipeline at the University of Oslo using the OMOP common data model.\n\"It marks an exciting milestone, opening avenues for our involvement in a new era of rapid and robust federated real-world studies on disease history, drug utilization, drug safety, and vaccine effectiveness. This study is an excellent start of this collaboration.\"\nThis study strengthens the findings on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing long COVID and post-acute complications. It also confirmed the usefulness of federated analytics and OMOP CDM that can be easily applied across national borders.\nMore information:\nNhung TH Trinh et al, Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent long COVID: data from Norway, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024).\nDOI: 10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00082-100082-1)\nLancet Respiratory Medicine []http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/issue/current University of Oxford []http://www.ox.ac.uk/",
