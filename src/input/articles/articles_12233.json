    "text": "What's the use of being a global superstar if you can't hook your parents up with unique experiences?\nEd Sheeran's dad, John Sheeran, is a retired art curator and educator. In an interview to promote a fundraising art lecture he's giving on March 28, he revealed that in 2021 he went to see Ed do a charity gig in Paris, and then Ed arranged something very special for them the next day.\nJohn told the\nEast Anglian Daily Times, \"[My wife] Imogen and I went to Paris to see Edward perform at the Global Citizen gig in front of the Eiffel Tower, which was extraordinary enough. He then surprised us on Sunday evening by taking us with his wife Cherry to the Louvre.\"\n\"He’d arranged to have the whole place to ourselves for three hours. I think it was his way of saying thank you to us,\" John continued. \"It is the only time I’ve been able to study the Mona Lisa without the crowds. It was an unforgettable experience.\"\nIn other Ed Sheeran news, he's\nintroduced his own line of loop pedals, those gadgets that allow him to create his own soundscape when he performs solo. \"I’m so excited to bring them out, and put my name to them, I hope everyone enjoys them, whether you are a beginner, or an expert,\" he writes on Instagram.",

    "text": "DECATUR, Ind. (WISH) — A commercial duck breeder in Adams County is the latest Indiana farm to be hit with avian influenza, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health reported Wednesday night. The affected flock, consisting of 3,215 ducks, has been quarantined, and control areas have been activated at farms in portions of Adams County and adjacent Jay County. Indiana, California and Pennsylvania are the top duck producing states in the United States. The commercial duck breeder site is the second farm in Adams County this year to have birds contract the virus. The first was a commercial turkey operation in January. It’s at least the 22nd farm in Indiana to be hit this year. So far, a state dashboard reports , 6,957,523 birds at Indiana farms have died of bird flu or been killed to stop its spread. Birds on Indiana farms are not the only ones affected. A bald eagle was found Monday seizing in a field, later dying what was suspected to be bird flu, News 8 reported . The Indiana Department of Natural Resources reported earlier this month that wild birds with avian influenza have been detected in 30 of the state’s 92 counties: Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Benton, Boone, Clinton, Decatur, Gibson, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Henry, Huntington, Jackson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Marion, Newton, Pike, Porter, Randolph, Ripley, Shelby, Starke, Tippecanoe, Union, Vanderburgh and Vermillion. The wild bird outbreak in Indiana includes more than 1,500 sandhill crane deaths in Greene, Jackson, Jasper, LaPorte, Newton, Starke and Union counties. Humans can get bird flu, and there’s been a recorded death in the U.S., but federal health officials say the risk to people’s health is low.",

    "title": "With iOS 18, Apple gives those in Hurricane prone areas a reason to upgrade to a new iPhone",
    "text": "With iOS 18, Apple gives those in Hurricane prone areas a reason to upgrade to a new iPhone No matter what certain politicians have recently said, we are not at the end of the Hurricane season in the U.S. We are at the halfway point which means that more Hurricanes are likely to hit. If Apple had a marketing department that didn't mind scaring the hell out of consumers, it could run an ad letting iPhone users in Hurricane-prone regions of the country know that they need to upgrade to an [iPhone 14](https://www.phonearena.com/iphone-14-release-date-price-features)model or later. And it's obviously not so they can use Apple Intelligence since you need an[iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/apple-iphone-15-pro-review_id5848),[iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.phonearena.com/iphone-15-pro-max-release-date-price-features), or any of the new[iPhone 16](https://www.phonearena.com/apple-iphone-16-release-date-price-features-news)models to run Apple's AI initiative.Starting with iOS 18, iPhone 14 models and later can send anyone a message using a satellite. No, the reason why those in areas of the U.S. that are frequently spooked by Hurricanes need an iPhone 14 or later model is for the satellite connectivity feature. When [iOS 16](https://www.phonearena.com/ios-16-release-date-features-news-compatible-iphones).1 was released, it brought Emergency SOS via satellite to the iPhone 14 (and subsequently later models). This feature allows those stuck in an area without cellular service or Wi-Fi to connect to emergency services via satellite.Before the next Hurricane, those with an iPhone 14 or later should try the demo for Messages via satellite. | Image credit-Apple When connected, you can text to emergency responders your Medical ID and emergency contact information, but only if you've taken the time to set them up. You will answer the emergency questionnaire, share your location (including elevation), and how much battery life remains on your iPhone. But [Apple](https://www.phonearena.com/apple)has taken things a step further with[iOS 18](https://www.phonearena.com/ios-18-release-date-features-news-compatible-iphones). Now, even when you're in an area without any cellular or Wi-Fi signals, you can communicate with anyone using Messages via satellite. You can even have a back and forth chat although sometimes it takes longer for a message to be sent. Emergency contacts and members of your Family Sharing group can initiate a conversation by sending you a text before you send one to them. You will see their messages as soon as you connect by satellite.Othera can engage in a chat with you when you are using Messages via satellite if you start the conversation by messaging them first even if you are in an area without any cellular or Wi-Fi signals. If you are using iMessage, your conversation will be protected by end-to-end encryption so that only you and the person you're chatting with can see what you've written. If you're an iPhone 14 or later user and have iOS 18 installed, this might even be useful to you right now if Hurricane Helene and Milton have left you without power, a cellular connection, and Wi-Fi. In South Florida back in 2005 when Hurricane Wilma left me without a cellular or Wi-Fi connection for a week, I was beginning to feel very isolated from the rest of the country. I remember how great it felt when cellular signals returned and I got to hear the end of the 2005 World Series (won by the Chicago White Sox, the team that 19 years later eclipsed the 1962 Mets as the biggest losers in modern baseball history). How to demo Messages via satellite and Emergency SOS via satellite But I digress. With Messages via satellite, you can still include emojis, react using Tapbacks over iMessage and SMS, and more. The service is free for two years after you activate your iPhone 14 or later model. You can try a demo to make sure that you know how to use the feature. Here's what you need to do: - To open Control Center, from the top right corner of your iPhone, swipe down. - Tap the Cellular button which you'll find on the right of Control Center. - Tap the Satellite button, then tap on Try Demo. - To learn how to connect to satellite, tap on Try Connecting to Satellite. - Tap on Emergency SOS to demo Emergency SOS via satellite works. Apple suggests you follow these hints to improve the chances of connecting with a satellite: - Be outside with a clear view of the sky and the horizon. - Be aware that trees with light foliage might slow down the connection. Dense foliage, hills or mountains, canyons, and tall structures might block the connection. - Hold your iPhone naturally in your hand. You don't need to raise your arm or hold your phone up, but don't put it in a pocket or backpack. - If you need to turn left or right or move to avoid a blocked signal, your iPhone provides onscreen instructions. - The satellite connection can be maintained even if your phone screen is locked. - Satellite connectivity might not work in places above 62° latitude, such as northern parts of Alaska. If you do live in an area of the U.S. where Hurricanes are a fact of life, try the demo to Message via satellite and Emergency SOS via satellite before the next Hurricane hits. This way, you'll know how to use both services if you need them. Loading Comments...",

    "text": "Bolivia: crisi economica, crisi politica e venti di destra\nCome gli scorpioni, prima di cedere il generale golpista boliviano Juan José Zúñiga ha dato il colpo di coda. In cauda venenum, mettevano in guardia i romani. Il veleno inoculato da Zúñiga è la dichiarazione fatta al momento del suo arresto: «Si è trattato di un autogolpe voluto dal presidente Luis Arce, in crisi, per riconquistare popolarità». E l’esercito, da lui rappresentato, è intervenuto perché «è il braccio armato del popolo» che «si oppone a uno Stato tenuto in ostaggio di una élite che ha il solo scopo di mantenersi al potere».\nPoco importa se l’élite è stata eletta quattro anni fa col 55% dei voti. E che storicamente i militari boliviani siano stati il braccio armato delle destre (ben 39 colpi di stato fra tentati e riusciti). Come fu nel 2019 quando insorsero contro l’allora presidente Morales e imposero il governo di Jeanine Áñez ( attualmente in galera).\nLa tesi dello «show mediatico» di un governo traballante per contraddizioni interne è stata naturalmente sostenuta apertamente dalla destra estrema – la deputata Luis Nayar, legata al leader di Santa Cruz, Luis Fernando Camacho (pure lui detenuto per il golpe del 2019). E, più velatamente, da quella “presentabile” come l’ex presidente Carlos Mesa, il quale si è espresso contro il pronunciamento armato, ma per mettere in chiaro che l’inetto governo di Arce deve essere battuto nelle elezioni del prossimo anno.\nAlla crisi politica ed economica – quest’ultima manifestatasi con una scarsezza di carburante e di valuta estera – che fa da sfondo al tentato golpe ha contribuito l’aspra lotta per il controllo del partito (di governo) Movimento al socialismo, Mas, tra Arce e l’ex presidente Evo Morales. Quest’ultimo, quasi ossessionato nel tentare di ripresentarsi come candidato alle presidenziali del prossimo anno, accusa il presidente di essersi impadronito della direzione del Mas per emarginarlo. A sua volta Arce ha direttamente indicato Morales come l’ispiratore di scioperi e proteste popolari per indebolire il governo e la sua presidenza.\nIl presidente Arce ha dimostrato fermezza e coraggio nel dar la cara al generale golpista e sopratttutto chiamando alla mobilitazione le forze popolari che, anche quattro anni fa, si sono opposte all’intervento armato e ne hanno pagato il prezzo. Questa è anche un’indicazione di come dovrà procedere nei prossimi mesi il governo progressista, favorendo un controllo civile e popolare sulle forze armate.\nChi ha preso molto sul serio la prova di forza in Bolivia, sono stati i leader progressisti del subcontinente latinoamericano, dal presidente di Cuba Miguel Díaz-Canel al brasiliano Lula da Silva, passando per l’honduregna Xiomara Castro, leader pro tempore della Celac (la Comunità di stati dell’America latina e dei Caraibi), il messicano Andres Manuel López Obrador, il colombiano Gustavo Petro, il cileno Gabriel Boric. Le accuse contro uno Stato facilmente controllato da élite (di sinistra naturalmente) sono troppo assimilabili al vento di estrema destra dell’argentino Javier Milei. Il quale ha passato gran parte del suo tempo negli ultimi mesi a viaggiare all’estero – soprattutto in Europa – per presentarsi come il leader di una destra globale fascistizzante.\n“La unica izquierda buena es la de Messi, lo demás es todo descartable” è il celebre messaggio continentale di Milei. Un messaggio amplificato dalle potente corporazioni neopentecostali e sostenuto dal generale Laura Richardson, capo del SouthCom degli Usa, fautrice di una moderna versione della dottrina Monroe. Ovvero che le risorse del subcontinente americano – acqua, litio, petrolio eccetera – devono essere sotto il controllo «degli americani», ovvero degli Usa.",

(WFSB/Gray News) - A firefighter who was plowing the snowy streets of Trumbull, Connecticut, jumped into action to rescue four people and three dogs when he happened upon a house fire. [WFSB](https://www.wfsb.com/2024/01/07/firefighter-plowing-route-notices-house-fire-rescues-people-pets/) reports Shaun Bogen’s quick actions were credited with saving the lives of the victims. The [Long Hill Fire Department said](https://www.facebook.com/longhillfd/posts/pfbid0uNJskTAvbNXazDW3ybvZ3mLqGGpdjbSUJLsFGQJZQHEJpVsSWnDyBrfeSmbCzbr3l) the house fire on Haviland Drive began just before 4 a.m. Sunday. While he was on the plowing route, Bogen discovered a house with a fire in the garage, according to the fire department. Bogen radioed into his base to alert them of the fire and called 911. Bogen then sprung into action, waking up the four sleeping residents and their three dogs and making sure everyone was outside before the fire department arrived. A total of 26 firefighters responded to the fire, and the first unit to arrive found the fire most heavy in the garage and extending into the home. The firefighters brought the fire under control in less than one hour. Officials said there did not appear to be any injuries. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

Guimarães deixou duras críticas ao sintético do Floriana, mas mostrou-se feliz com a vitória Treinador do V. Guimarães deixou duras críticas ao sintético do Floriana, mas mostrou-se feliz com a vitória [O V. Guimarães venceu, esta quinta-feira, o Floriana, por 1-0, na segunda pré-eliminatória da Liga Conferência, em Malta.](https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/jogo/aominuto/floriana/vitoria-sc/13815700) Na conferência pós-jogo, Rui Borges elogiou a capacidade mental da equipa e falou sobre a escassez de golos. «O resultado não é curto. Queríamos ganhar o jogo. Estou feliz pela capacidade de compromisso e rigor da equipa, que não perdeu o discernimento. Não entramos em ‘stress’ mental por pensarmos que éramos superiores e tínhamos de ganhar por 3-0 ou 4-0. Ganhámos perante uma equipa que se organizou de forma diferente da eliminatória anterior», começou por dizer aos jornalistas. «Fomos mais agressivos na segunda parte e percebemos melhor como criar desequilíbrios. Podíamos ter outro resultado. O adversário tem qualidade. Tivemos de o respeitar e respeitar a competição em que estamos. Se não respeitássemos, aqueles momentos de contra-ataque podiam-nos ter saído caros. A equipa mostrou rigor e concentração, o que me agradou imenso», destacou. Sobre o relvado sintético, algo que não utiliza na Liga e noutras grandes competições, o técnico 50 anos deixou críticas, confessando mesmo que «faz mal aos jogadores das duas equipas». «Sabíamos que ia ser um jogo difícil. A adaptação ao relvado sintético é muito diferente. Condiciona-nos mais a nós. O correr da bola e a intensidade são diferentes. E o campo estava completamente seco. A rega foi uma hora antes. Não me entra na cabeça como é possível estar numa competição europeia e jogar num relvado destes, e isso não é desculpa. Isto faz mal aos jogadores das duas equipas». Por fim, Rui Borges falou sobre as estreias de Alberto e João Miguel Mendes a titulares, elogiando a exibição dos dois, mas realçando que houve erros que «poderiam ter saído caros». «Fizeram um bom jogo, mas têm erros que poderiam ter saído caros. Estou feliz pelo Alberto, que podia sentir a pressão do jogo, ao estar pela primeira vez numa competição europeia. Há de ter mais oportunidades. O João tem sido bastante regular na pré-época. Mas todos deram uma boa resposta», concluiu.",

    "text": "If you took a look up at the sky in Lancaster County on Thursday night, odds are you were treated to a colorful sight. The northern lights were visible across several areas in the county, as well as York County. The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, were likely a result of a severe solar storm that prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to issue a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday into Friday after an outburst from the sun was detected earlier this week. The storm could temporarily disrupt power and radio signals, even as the U.S. deals with major back-to-back hurricanes. Hues of purple, blue, green and red can be visible across the sky during such events. It can be difficult to see with the naked eye, but they become easier to see using a phone camera. Forecasters do not expect the latest solar storm to surpass the one that slammed Earth in May, the strongest in more than two decades. But they won't know for sure until it's just 1 million miles away, where spacecraft can measure it.",
