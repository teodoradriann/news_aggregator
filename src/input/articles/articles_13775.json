It was 4 a.m. ET Wednesday when Kenzie Lewellen's labor began at her home in Port Charlotte, Florida, with Hurricane Milton hurtling toward the Gulf Coast.\nLewellen and her boyfriend, Dewey Bennett, 24, were both on edge.\n\"My mind was just running a million miles an hour, like, what am I going to do?\" said Lewellen, 22. \"I was very nervous.\"\nKenzie Lewellen holding her son, Dewey Lester Bennett, IV. Courtesy Kim Savage\nBennett, the baby's father, said in an interview Thursday, \"I was very stressed.\"\nIn 2017, Bennett's own father, also named Dewey, died when Hurricane Irma slammed into Florida.\n\"My dad had a massive heart attack because the ambulance could not come out to us during the storm,\" he said.

    "text": "Miami Herald Domestic dispute in Kendall ends with a shocking find in a garbage bin. ‘It’s an odd one’ Charles Rabin December 28, 2023 at 10:47 PM · 4 min read 14 Link Copied Read full article\nPolice say Armando Benavides’s troubled relationship with his ex-wife reached a boiling point just a few days before Christmas when after getting into a fight, he shot her in the leg. She’s okay and expected to recover, police said.\nBut what police say Benavides did next differs a bit from most violent domestic disputes: He walked a few blocks through his residential West Kendall neighborhood, lifted the lid of a green garbage bin in front of a home, climbed inside and shut the cover.\nThen he shot and killed himself.\n“He steps right into the bin and pulls the lid and then commits suicide,” said Miami-Dade Police Spokesman Andre Martin. “It’s an odd one to be sure.”\nPolice know that, because they watched Benavides climb into the bin and never get out, on surveillance video from a nearby home, according to a Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office report. The report also said that no one looked inside the garbage bin between the time Benavides got into it and when his body was discovered.\nAlso found next to Benavides in the bin: the 9 mm gun police say he used to shoot his ex-wife, then himself.\nWhen exactly Benavides killed himself is not known. But police believe he was inside the bin for at least 14 hours before his body was discovered by a solid waste truck driver who dumped the bin’s belongings into his truck. Martin said the driver, watching a camera attached to the arm that lifts the garbage, believed he saw some type of holiday decorations that needed to be separated.\nWhen he walked behind the truck to take a look inside, he found much more than ornaments and garlands.\n“He saw the body,” said Martin.\nHistory of depression In the week since Benavides allegedly killed himself, information had been hard to come by. But Wednesday afternoon the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner released a report that shed some light on the Kendall man’s antics.\nBorn in Cuba and living in the Miami area for about three decades, Benavides was an insurance broker. He also, according to an investigator in the Medical Examiner’s Office, had a history of depression and had been involuntarily committed to hospitals for being mentally unstable at least twice. His ex-wife said he had attempted suicide before and threatened it often.\nBenavides, according to the medical examiner, “has been known to have outbursts while possessing a firearm.”\nAlso by Wednesday, police had not released any requested paperwork. And attempts to reach the driver of the garbage truck or anyone with Miami-Dade Solid Waste or its union spokesman, went unanswered.\nPolice say Benavides — who would have turned 55 on Christmas Day — lived in a West Kendall home with a wife he had divorced years earlier and two sons, 17 and 23. The home was about a mile from where his body was found at Southwest 84th Street and 161st Place. A person who answered the door at the home Thursday said no one wanted to talk.\nInvestigators believe Benavides shot his ex-wife, who hasn’t been named, after arguing with her some time during the evening of Dec. 19. Then, just past midnight after walking through the neighborhood, he climbed into the bin and shut the lid. From his home, he had to cross over Kendall Drive, head four blocks south, go another four blocks west, before finding the bin.\nMiami-Dade Police are reviewing surveillance video taken from nearby homes to try and fill in some blanks. The truck driver discovered the body the next afternoon at 2:22 p.m. Dec. 20.\nBy then, police had been searching for Benavides for about 12 hours. He was wanted for the attempted murder of his ex-wife.\nMartin said police found the gun Benavides used on himself inside the bin and that it matched forensically with the weapon used in the shooting of his wife.\nNeighbors near where the body had been found were shocked. The trash bin belongs to an elderly couple, said Manju Matta, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years.\n“It’s too close to home,” Matta said, standing in her doorway. “It’s scared me. It happened right in my neighborhood.”\nMiami Herald Staff Writer Devoun Cetoute contributed to this report.\nThe Florida Department of Health offers a suicide prevention and crisis lifeline.

Ici, des centaines de milliers de soudanais se sont installés dans des camps de fortune, sur des kilomètres carrés. Ils sont revenus se réfugier au Tchad afin d’échapper à la guerre qui frappe leur pays. À bord, Pierre-Yves Scotto coordonne l’aide humanitaire dans le pays pour l’Union européenne.\nLe camp grossit chaque jour \" Chaque fois, le camp grossit. Il n’y a pas assez de moyens pour répondre à tout ça. Il y a encore beaucoup de personnes qui sont complètement démunies, qui n’ont pas reçu assez d’assistance. Elles sont extrêmement traumatisées à cause des violences que les civils subissent dans ce conflit-là \", commente-t-il. Au poste-frontière, une colonne de charrettes arrive du Soudan. Plusieurs centaines de réfugiés arrivent chaque jour, surtout des femmes et des enfants.\nUne famille marche depuis deux jours, avec deux nourrissons de quelques semaines. Ils ont tout perdu, sauf quelques objets entassés à la hâte. \" Hier encore, nous avons été pris dans un échange de tirs. On a eu très peur. Beaucoup de gens sont morts. (…) Tout le monde a souffert et continue à souffrir. Les gens ont soif, ils ont faim. C’était intenable \", confie une femme. Au Soudan, deux généraux, autrefois alliés, se font aujourd’hui la guerre pour le contrôle du pays. Trois millions de personnes ont quitté leur maison, et 500 000 réfugiés sont arrivés au Tchad.

    "text": "What to know about keeping children safe — and warm — in the car during the winter A major winter storm is headed for the East Coast this weekend, so people will likely want to dress themselves — and their families — to protect against the harsh elements. But before a car ride, parents should think twice about bundling up their little ones. For children, a bulky coat and a car seat can be a dangerous pairing. According to [Emily A. Thomas](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/about-us/our-people/our-experts/emily-thomas/index.htm), auto safety manager at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center, a thick, puffy coat or too many layers [shouldn't be worn underneath a car seat's safety harness](https://www.consumerreports.org/babies-kids/car-seats/the-dangers-of-winter-coats-and-car-seats-a5483582251/). Extra bulk leaves the straps too loose and thus ineffective in a car crash, she says. \"What happens is that those layers and that puffiness will compress during a crash, and it introduces additional slack in the child's harness system in their car seat,\" says Thomas. So what's the best way to keep a child both warm and safe? Here are some tips for optimal safety. Do the pinch test Start by securing your child in his or her safety harness while your child is wearing the coat. Tighten the harness as much as possible so there is no gap between the clothes and the straps. Next, unhook the car seat and remove your child. Take the coat off and put your child back in with the same harness-strap adjustment as before. If the straps are too loose, there's an issue. \"If you're able to pinch any of the harness strap between your fingers again at their shoulders, that tells you that the coat that they're using is creating slack in the system,\" says Thomas. Drape layers on top of the harness While it can be inconvenient, removing the puffer coat each time will help prevent the child from moving around in the event of a crash — even potentially moving outside the protection of the car seat. \"And in order to still keep them warm, you can drape a blanket over them after they've been properly harnessed, or you can put their coat on them backwards on top of their harness like a blanket,\" says Thomas. \"This will help to keep them warm throughout the car ride.\" Check the rest of the car seat It's important to always make sure that for every car ride, your child's harness is nice and tight, Thomas says — and the chest clip should be at armpit level for proper security. Otherwise, make sure that the chest and the crotch buckles are always secured. You'll want to double-check the installation of the seat itself in the vehicle as well. \"[The car seat] shouldn't move more than 1 inch side to side or front to back if you pull on the install,\" says Thomas. Lastly, Thomas says that if the child's seat faces forward, always attach that top tether to the seat itself. It helps reduce the forward motion of the car seat during a crash. Copyright 2024 NPR.

My love and adoration for him only grows.\" Video above: Emma Heming Willis 'not good' amid husband Bruce Willis' dementia battle The couple wed in 2009 and share two daughters together, Mabel and Evelyn. Heming also posted a vulnerable message to her [\"Die Hard\"](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/24/entertainment/peter-billingsley-die-hard-christmas/index.html) actor's [health issues](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/entertainment/bruce-willis-moonlighting-creator/index.html), sharing in the video that she \"was able to have a good cry\" with a close friend. \"It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and just kind of soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do,\" Heming said in the video. In February, Willis's family – including Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore and his daughters – [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html) that the actor has been diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or [FTD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737) for short. Heming, who has been open about her journey as Willis's primary caretaker on her social media ever since, said in her video this week that \"holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard.\" She added that \"building a community and connection\" has helped her get through it this year. \"That has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that,\" she said. Heming wrote in the caption to her Instagram video about receiving \"countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved,\" and that these messages help her feel \"less alone.\" \"I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much,\" she wrote. \"I am grateful to you.\"",

    "text": "Historia\nPresidente Vicente Guerrero, el mandato de un héroe de la Independencia\nCuando Vicente Guerrero llegó a la presidencia de la Nación, México pasaba por un periodo difícil, pues la independencia no había resultado del todo como se esperaba, el poder se disputaba entre diferentes facciones políticas y había una latente amenaza de invasión extranjera.\nVicente Guerrero, héroe de la independencia y futuro presidente de México\nDespués de la caída del Imperio, Vicente Guerrero siguió al servicio del pueblo a través de la logia de los masones Yorkinos. Detuvo la rebelión de Vicente Gómez en 1824, cuyo objetivo era la expulsión definitiva y total de los españoles y sus descendientes del territorio mexicano.\nGuerrero, al ser un hombre de justicia, no solo destruyó estos planes, sino que abogó por los afectados; hasta que en 1829 supo de planes por parte de estos para “reconquistar” México.\nEn 1828, cuando Nicolás Bravo se alzó en armas en contra del gobierno de Guadalupe Victoria, Vicente Guerrero fue enviado a combatirlo y resultó vencedor.\nEstos sucesos y sus infinitas maneras de ayudar a los demás le dieron un lugar especial en las mentes y los corazones de los mexicanos, especialmente entre la clase media y clase baja, las sociedades mexicanas más numerosas por aquellos días.\nLas elecciones presidenciales\nSe acercaba el momento en el que Guadalupe Victoria tendría que ser reemplazado y los masones Yorkinos, así como el embajador de los Estados Unidos, Joel Roberts Poinsett, ponían sus esperanzas en Vicente Guerrero; quien tenía excelentes relaciones con todos los estratos sociales, claro que por parte de los más poderosos, solo contaba con la simpatía de los de ideología liberal.\nSin embargo, la Constitución de 1824 estipulaba que el presidente sería elegido por los 36 representantes de las legislaturas estatales y no por el voto popular, lo cuál le dio la victoria a su contrincante, Manuel Gómez Pedraza, quién solo se identificaba con la facción conservadora y los aristócratas.\nEntre rebeliones y el fiero descontento del pueblo mexicano, el Congreso desconoció a Gómez Pedraza como Presidente de México y Vicente Guerrero tomó la presidencia de México el 1ero de abril de 1829.\n¡Visita el Estado de Guerrero!\nPresidente Vicente Guerrero\nDurante su mandato, el presidente Vicente Guerrero hizo varias acciones que cambiaron la justicia en México, como:\n- Abolición de la esclavitud: Guerrero, un ferviente abolicionista, promulgó legislación para abolir la esclavitud en México, una medida que reflejaba su compromiso con los principios de igualdad y libertad.\n- Reforma agraria: Reconociendo las desigualdades en la distribución de la tierra, Guerrero impulsó reformas agrarias para redistribuir las tierras entre los campesinos y combatir el latifundismo.\n- Política exterior: Guerrero buscó mantener la independencia de México frente a las potencias extranjeras, resistiendo presiones de intervención y promoviendo relaciones diplomáticas basadas en el respeto mutuo.\n- Lucha contra la corrupción: Guerrero implementó medidas para combatir la corrupción en el gobierno, buscando asegurar la transparencia y la rendición de cuentas.\nEl Fin de la Presidencia de Guerrero\nA pesar de sus esfuerzos por estabilizar el país, el mandato del presidente Vicente Guerrero enfrentó oposición interna y externa. Las tensiones políticas y las rivalidades entre facciones se intensificaron, y la situación se volvió insostenible.\nFinalmente, en 1830, Vicente Guerrero fue derrotado y capturado en una conspiración liderada por Antonio López de Santa Anna.\nTras su captura, Vicente Guerrero fue juzgado sumariamente y ejecutado el 14 de febrero de 1831. Su legado perduró como un símbolo de lucha por la libertad y la justicia en la historia de México, recordando el compromiso de aquellos que sacrificaron todo por el bienestar de nuestra nación.",

    "text": "Voici deux solutions pour le moins insolites à l’étude. La Nasa a annoncé soutenir une étude pour une maison qui « pousserait » à l’aide de champignons. De son côté, l’agence spatiale européenne (ESA) étudie comment fabriquer des briques de Lego à partir de matériaux lunaires. au sommaire La Lune paraît encore bien loin [avec les retards](http://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/actualites/astronautique-artemis-iii-nasa-envisage-scenario-alternatif-atterrissage-lune-113109/) du programme américain Artemis, mais les agences spatiales continuent d'étudier les solutions pour s'y installer durablement avec une base au pôle sud. L'idée est d'optimiser l'onéreux transport des charges vers la surface et d'utiliser au mieux les ressources sur place. Utiliser des champignons Imagineriez-vous vivre dans une maison de Schtroumpfs sur la Lune ? C'est une des nombreuses options un tantinet insolites étudiées par la Nasa, qui cherche toutes les solutions pour construire des habitats lunaires, mais aussi martiens. Le projet Mycotecture Off Planet est porté depuis 2018 par une équipe de chercheurs du centre californien Ames de la Nasa. L'idée est de [concevoir un habitat](https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/actualites/mars-mars-chercheurs-proposent-construire-habitations-sang-urine-larmes-93552/) qui s'autoconstruit, s'autorépare, et protège les astronautes des radiations. Le matériau utilisé est du mycélium fongique, base des [champignons](/planete/definitions/classification-vivant-champignon-14469/)champignons connus pour envahir et coloniser les milieux souterrains. Ce matériau vivant est isolant, plus résistant à la compression que le [bois](/planete/definitions/botanique-bois-4042/)bois de [construction](/maison/definitions/construction-maison-liant-17955/)construction et plus flexible que le [béton](/maison/definitions/batiment-beton-5834/)béton. Pour se développer, le mycélium fongique a besoin d'eau et de nourriture. L'étude suggère donc son utilisation après l'arrivée sur le sol de premières missions habitées. Ainsi, tout serait déjà sur place (on peut trouver de la glace d'eau sur la Lune, et les [déchets](/planete/definitions/developpement-durable-dechet-5725/)déchets organiques serviraient de nourriture), ce qui réduirait les coûts logistiques des missions suivantes. Vers une démonstration en orbite Le projet Mycotecture Off Planet a désormais dépassé le stade de « preuve de concept » selon la Nasa. Les équipes ont déjà réussi à créer des biocomposites à partir des champignons, fabriqué des prototypes, et testé des matériaux dans un simulateur planétaire. Les résultats sont prometteurs. Après un premier financement en 2020 via son programme Niac dédié aux concepts innovants avancés, la Nasa renouvelle son soutien dans le but cette fois-ci de mettre au point une démonstration en orbite basse. « La Nasa aura besoin de nouvelles sciences et technologies qu'on ne connaît pas encore », précise Bill Nelson, directeur de la Nasa. L'agence spatiale américaine cherche à revenir sur la Lune dès que possible avec les missions Artemis. Mais la Lune n'est qu'une étape vers Mars. C'est dans cet objectif que la Nasa est prête à financer les études les plus folles, sans limiter l'imagination. Du Lego en régolithe L' [ESA](/sciences/definitions/univers-esa-2466/)ESA étudie depuis des années la conception de briques lunaires, faites à partir de matériaux qu'on peut trouver sur place. « Personne n'a construit de structure sur la Lune, donc il est intéressant de pouvoir tester tout type de design et de techniques de construction avec nos briques spatiales », indique dans un communiqué l'officier scientifique de l'ESA Aidan Cowley. L'ESA a commencé à construire des briques semblables à celles des Lego, à partir de poussière lunaire. Précisons qu'il ne s'agit pas ici de vraie poussière lunaire comme on pourrait en trouver dans les échantillons rapportés par les missions [Apollo](/sciences/definitions/univers-apollo-3743/)Apollo, Luna, ou plus récemment avec [la mission chinoise Chang’e 6](http://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/actualites/astronautique-sonde-change-6-rapporte-terre-tresor-1-935-grammes-graal-planetologues-114319/) : les scientifiques ont utilisé du [régolithe](/sciences/definitions/planetes-regolithe-13527/)régolithe provenant d'une [météorite](/sciences/definitions/univers-meteorite-872/)météorite. Les États-Unis et l'ESA ne sont pas les seuls à s'intéresser à la construction sur la Lune. [La Chine entend](http://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/actualites/lune-ambitions-cachees-chine-lune-113412/) en faire la démonstration sur place en 2028 avec sa mission automatique Chang'e 8.",

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Thousands of runners are gearing up for the Los Angeles Marathon Sunday, and among them is one of the youngest athletes to participate in the competition. At just 13 years old, Nyla Evans has been training with the help of Students Run LA , a nonprofit organization that helps at-risk middle and high school students train for the marathon. Nyla's mother Johanna Voutounou said during the pandemic, the teen didn't really do a lot of physical activity. \"She started to gain a lot of anxiety with her return back to school,\" she said. \" has really supported her and I think a lot of students across Los Angeles.\" Voutounou said this is actually Nyla's first year running in this capacity. \"It's just so wonderful that she found something that gives her an outlet, an activity, and then meet a goal. I'm so grateful for running ... So to go from having never done it before to now running a marathon, it's just incredible.\" Jacqueline Arambula, a Students Run LA coach, said she's thrilled to see all the hard work the students' are putting into the training. \"Even after they've been stressed out with homework, they still come out here and they give it their all after school for up to two hours,\" she said. \"So it's very admirable to see these students come out here and just have fun while running. Nyla is an amazing student and athlete. She outruns almost every girl in the team. Just to see her run, it really motivates the other students to run just as fast.\" How does Nyla feel about the experience? For her, it's just pure fun. \"I don't think I would be as happy or energetic as I am. It's really helped me a lot and it's just really makes you happy every day.\"",
