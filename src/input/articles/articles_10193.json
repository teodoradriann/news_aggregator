    "text": "Peace activists have taken part in a protest in Israel’s third-largest city, Haifa, demanding a ceasefire in the war on Gaza and the exchange of captives and prisoners between Hamas and Israel.\n“This is the first time we are seeing this protest happen in the north,” said Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Haifa on Saturday.\n“It’s a protest with Israeli Jews and Palestinian Israelis, and it is significant because of the two coming together.\n“The message here is to end the war and that they can only live peacefully side by side with a political solution for the Palestinians,” she said.\nOmri Evron, a member of the Communist Party of Israel, who helped organise the anti-war protest, spoke to Al Jazeera about the message the protesters were hoping to convey.\n“The killing of thousands and thousands of Palestinians, the vast majority of whom are innocent civilians, is not only reprehensible, it does not serve the security of the people of Israel. It does not bring us security, it only ensures the next massacre, the next cycle of violence,” he said.\n“Currently, they [the protestors] are chanting “refuse to kill, refuse to fight, refuse to murder” – this is our call.”\nEvron admitted there were difficulties in organising a protest of this kind.\n“It has been difficult, not because there aren’t Jews and Arabs who want to come together who believe in a joint future of peace and equality and national liberation of both people in two states,” he explained.\n“It has been difficult because the government and the police in particular have done everything in their power to prevent us from coming together, to prevent us from voicing a lawful and peaceful voice. We had to appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice just to allow us to come together and demonstrate.”\nAl Jazeera’s Dekker said the protesters were not allowed to march, and officials said the protest could not be held at night. But several hundred people were finally able to gather for two hours during the day.\nThe post ‘Refuse to fight’: Jewish, Arab activists call for peace in Israel’s Haifa appeared first on Al Jazeera .",

    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Lecturer and Counter Terrorism Campaigner receives OBE in New Year Honours University of Salford Lecturer Travis Frain has been appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King Charles in his New Year Honours List. Travis, 25 from Darwen, is a Counter Terrorism campaigner and survived serious injuries sustained in the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March 2017. After months of recuperation Travis decided to commit the rest of his life to working to help prevent future attacks, and supporting anyone who might be caught up in terrorist events. Since 2017, Travis has delivered Counter Terrorism training workshops to over 100,000 young people in schools, colleges and community centres around the UK. In 2021, he founded the [ Resilience in Unity Project](https://www.resilienceinunity.com) with a mission to counter radicalisation by empowering the voices of survivors of terrorism from around the world, bringing them together to foster resilience. In August 2023 Travis was appointed to his job at University of Salford where he teaches counter terrorism and investigation skills to trainee Police Officers joining Greater Manchester Police. Travis also works with Counter Terrorism Policing HQ (SO15) at New Scotland Yard in London as an Advisor, Ambassador, and formerly the National Chair of their Youth Advisory Network. Commenting on the award, Travis said: “To be appointed an OBE by His Majesty The King is undoubtedly the honour of a lifetime. I am immensely humbled that people felt my work was worthy of recognition, and I only hope that this will shine a light on the terrific work being conducted by thousands of likeminded individuals up and down the country to try and counter the spread of violent extremism, and prevent further terrorist attacks.” The citation issued by Buckingham Palace also recognises the work Travis has done to advocate and campaign for improvements in the support services provided to victims of terrorism. Travis works with several organisations to enhance outcomes for victims, including the National Emergencies Trust and Rapaid. “I suspect this honour is likely a recognition of the countless late nights I’ve spent chipping away behind the scenes and trying to lobby Government for change. The simple fact is that the state can, and should, be doing so much more to support victims of terrorism, and I only hope that with this award, I’m able to continue driving home that message until we get the change that is needed.” For all press office enquiries please email [communications@salford.ac.uk](mailto:communications@salford.ac.uk).

    "text": "La solicitud de aplicar tecnologías obsoletas, la entrega fragmentada y parcial de información necesaria para elaborar ofertas serias y las contradicciones técnicas de las bases de licitación, ahuyentaron a cualquier oferente.\nLa licitación convocada para contratar servicios de “auditoría informática y reforzar la supervisión del sistema automatizado de distribución de demandas civiles” a los tribunales del país fue declarada desierta el 13 de noviembre, pues nadie presentó ofertas.\nNo parece extraño. El predicado de la convocatoria era también “fortalecer la seguridad y transparencia” del proceso de tramitación electrónica de ellas, pero la estructura técnica de la licitación fue tan feble que hacía imposible para un oferente serio satisfacer los requerimientos puestos por la entidad responsable: la Corporación Administrativa del Poder Judicial (CAPJ). Ayudó el historial de autogobierno, descontrol, yerros y omisiones de esa Corporación, pese a depender jerárquicamente de la CS, que tornaron brumosa y poco transparente la licitación, sugiriendo una sombra plausible de corrupción.\nLa lectura atenta de las Bases de Licitación y su convocatoria, dadas las cosas que se pidieron, sugirió desde un principio la búsqueda solo de argumentos formales para facilitar respuestas administrativas ante las numerosas críticas públicas que ha recibido el sistema de distribución de causas.\nEn lo particular, respecto de la manipulación de su algoritmo para producir forum shopping (compra de tribunal) y obtener de manera ilegal la certeza de un resultado final favorable en un juicio. La imposibilidad de la CAPJ de entregar explicaciones coherentes y satisfactorias a esas críticas habrían sido el motivo para impulsar esta licitación, a fin de cubrir u ocultar los problemas del algoritmo y la distribución de causas.\nBlog de preguntas y respuestas Toda licitación pública tiene un período de aclaración de las bases, consistente en preguntas y respuestas, que, una vez concluido, pasa a formar parte de las bases mismas. Ya durante este proceso, que terminó el 5 de noviembre, quedaron claras las contradicciones y la falta de información adecuada que la CAPJ entregaría a los eventuales oferentes.\nLa duda que surgió en esa parte del proceso licitatorio fue: ¿por qué no se exigió una propuesta orientada a la implementación de una ISO 2700, que desde hace dos décadas es el estándar de seguridad para manejo de información crítica, con versiones mejoradas regularmente en el sistema, la última de 2022? La licitación no exigió ni para el sistema de distribución de causas ni los otros sistemas mencionados en ella, los controles y pruebas que posee la ISO 2700, y que son claves para garantizar la seguridad de la información.\nEntre ellos:\ni) Controles de acceso y autenticación: resguardo de los códigos fuente y acceso limitado de desarrolladores solo a módulos en que trabajan.\nii) G estión de cambios: identificar desarrolladores desde creación del código fuente con documentación e historial de modificaciones (trazabilidad; licitación planteó GitHub y auditar código actual, lo que elimina historial).\niii) Pruebas de seguridad del código: manuales y automatizadas.\niv) Confidencialidad y cifrado.\nv) Revisión de vulnerabilidades y actualización de parches (el gestor de bases de datos solicitado, Oracle 11g, lo deja fuera).\nvi) Seguridad en el entorno de desarrollo: seguridad del entorno de desarrollo y almacén del código para prevenir accesos no autorizados y pérdida de datos.\nvii) Evaluación de dependencias y bibliotecas de terceros.\nviii) Documentación y mantenimiento.\nix) Gestión de incidentes: documentar todos los incidentes desde la puesta en marcha del sistema.\nEste último aspecto es posiblemente la información más fragmentada o derechamente inexistente en el funcionamiento del sistema actual de la CAPJ que se debía auditar. Requeridos los logs (constancia de incidentes) de períodos cortos y específicos, nunca han sido entregados por la CAPJ, aunque debieran tenerlos.\nTecnologías obsoletas Las bases de la frustrada licitación exigieron que la auditoría a desarrollar incluyera revisión del código fuente, funciones, procedimientos, algoritmos y otros componentes del sistema de distribución de causas civiles del Poder Judicial (punto 9 en bases técnicas), sin aclarar nunca si se pedía una auditoría dirigida solo a la revisión de códigos fuentes y nada más.\nSe exigió además a los posibles oferentes que debían contar con una ISO 9001 o superior, la cual está enfocada en la calidad de los procesos y no en la seguridad , a diferencia de una certificación ISO 27001 .\nEllo es una diferencia grande, pues la vulneración de un sistema informático se produce a través de varias capas que se deben certificar y auditar para evitar precisamente las vulneraciones de los sistemas. En determinados casos, las manipulaciones maliciosas avanzan y llegan hasta la base de datos para obtener y modificar información de manera maliciosa (caso Servipag).\nPara la CAPJ ello es muy crítico, pues tiene un gestor de bases de datos obsoleto, que es lo más crítico de su sistema computacional. Por ello, lo más adecuado era orientarla en materia de seguridad a una ISO 27001. Sin embargo, las bases exigieron, incluso, el uso de Oracle 11g como base de datos, un sistema obsoleto y que expone los sistemas a ataques externos, limitando la capacidad de escalabilidad y rendimiento del sistema, en un contexto en el que la carga de trabajo judicial es cada vez mayor.\nDepender de Oracle 11g como base de datos implica no poder escalar el sistema y riesgos graves de seguridad, pues se trata de un software obsoleto y sin soporte desde diciembre de 2020, que no recibe actualizaciones de seguridad, y que expone a quien lo tiene a vulnerabilidades sin parches y a fáciles manipulaciones.\nEn un entorno judicial, esta carencia de protección es un riesgo de seguridad severo. Deja todo el sistema vulnerable a ataques y pone en riesgo la integridad de los procesos judiciales. Es este riesgo el que afecta la fiabilidad del algoritmo encargado de distribuir las demandas civiles de forma automática, pues queda abierta la posibilidad de que el sistema funcione bajo intervención externa , lo que ha sido sistemáticamente apuntado por variados actores judiciales sin obtener respuestas de la CAPJ.\nNo se trata solo de tecnología, sino también de economía, pues incrementa los costos de mantenimiento, al requerir conocimientos específicos casi agotados en el mercado laboral.\nSin soporte oficial, cualquier problema deberá ser resuelto internamente, elevando los costos de administración, fuera de los riesgos de incumplimiento en normas de ciberseguridad y protección moderna de datos. La percepción de que el sistema judicial depende de tecnología manipulable y sin protección, daña inevitablemente la credibilidad del sistema de justicia.\nDe ahí que parece muy positivo para la transparencia y la probidad pública, en momentos difíciles del Poder Judicial, que la convocatoria a esta licitación haya sido evaluada negativamente por el mercado y se haya declarado oficialmente desierta.\nEl contenido vertido en esta columna de opinión es de exclusiva responsabilidad de su autor, y no refleja necesariamente la línea editorial ni postura de El Mostrador .",
