    "title": "一鱼塘现大坑吞200多斤鲤鱼 岩溶塌陷引发关注_新闻频道_中华网",
    "text": "3月3日，湖南省娄底市桑梓镇一鱼塘发生塌陷，形成一个大坑。塘主吴先生表示，鱼塘里养了200多斤鲤鱼，水和鱼在几分钟内全部流光。\n事后，工作人员前往现场勘察，初步判断鱼塘可能属于岩溶塌陷。三年前附近也曾发生类似情况，但诱发塌陷的原因是多方面的。当地政府已设立警戒线，并安排人员轮班值守。\n媒体发布的视频显示，几近干涸的鱼塘中央有一个较大的坑洞。吴先生回忆说，塌陷发生在中午，“做午饭时水都还是满的，大概几分钟之后水就流干了。”\n3月5日，桑梓镇人民政府接到了群众的电话反映，工作人员迅速前往现场。湖南省自然资源调查所的调查人员也抵达现场进行勘察。塌陷的鱼塘距离居民区较远，没有造成人员伤亡。\n调查人员黄先生到达现场后发现，塌陷形成的坑洞直径约3米，深度约1米，洞中有水。他推测这是一次岩溶塌陷，地表下面是可溶岩，遇水钙化后形成空洞，即地下暗河那种溶洞。这里的土层相对较薄，加上长期被鱼塘的水软化，最终导致塌陷。这种现象在当地较为常见。\n黄先生还了解到，三年前离这个鱼塘二三十米远的地方也曾发生过类似的塌陷。当时那块农田种着水稻，也有水泡着。除了地表薄弱，地下水的运动也会诱发地表塌陷。最近下雨导致地下水流失，在地下形成真空环境，地面压强增大，最终导致地面塌陷。\n黄先生分析称，该鱼塘所属地层为二叠系茅口组灰岩，存在塌陷隐患。不过，如果地表底下是完整的岩石且土地本身较厚，则不会发生塌陷。目前，调查人员已完成地面调查和周边走访，将把结果形成简报提供给新化县自然资源局。",

    "text": "Aamir Khan is known to play every on-screen role with perfection. However, the toughest role of his life is unfolding right now, as he is gearing up for the wedding of his dotting daughter Ira Khan. Usually, they say that a father gives away his daughter at a wedding, but for Aamir, it is more like welcoming a son to his family.During one of his old interviews with Hindustan Times, Aamir Khan opened up about his views on his soon-to-be son-in-law Nupur Shikhare. Even at the risk of sounding filmy, he confessed that he feels Nupur is like a son to him. 106328803He called him a lovely boy and said he had become already a part of the family. Aamir mentioned that Nupur stood by Ira on occasion when she needed him the most. He helped her battle depression and handled her with utmost love and care. Further, Aamir felt emotional while pouring his heart out on the subject of Ira and Nupur. He admitted that he is a sentimental person and it would be hard for him to hold back his tears on the wedding day. The family is already concerned as to who will be handling Aamir. 106313271Ira Khan and Nupur Shikhare are going to tie the knot in a traditional Marathi style on January 3, 2024. Reports suggest that the wedding will be a star-studded affair, but even those who would not be able to make it to the special day on January 3, will be showering their blessings on the couple at the reception. Interestingly, there will be two grand receptions, one will be held in Delhi and the other in Jaipur, reportedly on January 6 and 10 respectively.",
