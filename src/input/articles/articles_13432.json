The representatives of the “Nationwide Union” didn’t conceal that there was no such marketing campaign on coordinate with the town.\nFaina Kukliansky, the chairman of the Lithuanian Jewish neighborhood, was the primary to handle this, outraged by the initiative, she urged the authorities to reply: “I cannot tear down any tables myself . Let the one that must do it. We’re getting ready an announcement, we will certainly specific our opinion not solely in Lithuania, but additionally internationally.”\nWe want to remind you that within the beforehand revealed findings of the Genocide and Resistance Analysis Heart of the Lithuanian inhabitants concerning Colonel Okay. Škirpa, it’s evaluated his vital contribution to placing the towards the Soviet occupation regime, however it’s confirmed that it’s in 1940-1941. his actions “had been additionally manifestations of anti-Semitism”.\nThe mayor of the capital, Valdas Benkunskas, stated that regulation enforcement shall be consulted in regards to the memorial plaque: “We see at the least three violations based mostly on authorized actions. It was known as civil disobedience. It appears to me that that is cynical hooliganism, which is conditioned by slender political pursuits after the European Parliament elections have simply ended and seen their hopeless outcomes.”\nRush for removing on a vacation weekend\nAlready on Sunday afternoon, the staff of the corporate arrived within the city of “Grinda” with a bunch of law enforcement officials to take away the board, nonetheless, residents got here shortly to guard it, so it needed to the police arrested them first, spectators did the method, wherein they will see how the police push the individuals defending him from the desk and when the video reveals a younger man dragged by the neck, holding the Vytis flag after which pressured to the bottom They had been on the desk, but additionally the netizens who noticed the movies.\nEven the Minister of Inner Affairs, Agne Bilotaitai, needed to clarify the very aggressive actions of the police. “Officers select response techniques to make sure public order and public security after assessing the scenario of the occasion,” stated A.

Škirpa’s desk with their our bodies, that they don’t oppose the police or argue. Nevertheless, the boys had been arrested and brought to the police station, the place they had been launched after a while with an administrative high-quality for not following the directions of the authorized officers.\nConsidered one of them, Andrius, whereas speaking to “Vakaro žinias” requested why they had been detained, Andrius stated that it was most likely an try and scare them: “The police despatched us all gone from the memorial board. The police stated nothing. for us, my pal and I wished to depart, however the police caught us and arrested us. we did not do something.\nLike that older man who was doing nothing however holding a flag and was pushed to the bottom by the police. We had been by no means associated to the “Nationwide Union”, however for some motive we turned a goal, we had been probably the most influential, perhaps they wished to scare us .”\nPaulius, who was brutally detained, put down on the ground by the police and crushed together with his foot, says that he feels properly at the moment, that he suffered solely scratches. Nevertheless, the younger man doesn’t conceal that he didn’t anticipate such a keep. “In fact, I did not anticipate it. However I haven’t got any expertise with the police, so I do not know if such detention is regular. The one fascinating coincidence is that I used to be put down and crushed like George Floyd, who died within the US after being arrested by the police, however I survived. “Maybe I ought to enchantment towards such detention,” Paulius informed “Vakaro žinia”. Nevertheless, the younger man makes certain that such an expertise doesn’t scare him, and if that’s mandatory, he’ll proceed to take part in civic actions and defend his rights.\nIt jogged my memory of the methods of the militia\nVytautas Radžvilis, the chairman of “Nationwide Uniting”, interviewed by “Vakaro žinios”, the occasions of the weekend reminded him of the occasions of the Soviet militia.

Radžvilas.\nHe says it is very important discover out who ordered occasions like this and who instructed the police to make use of violence: “There was not the least resistance. The younger individuals did nothing in any respect. Considered one of them was holding the flag, however he was brutally arrested, he was knocked to the bottom, his arms had been damaged, his neck was crushed with a foot. Specialists say it was a life-threatening operation – the neck may have been damaged or the carotid artery compressed, which may have triggered the person’s dying. “\nMany individuals had been stunned, after seeing the anger video, within the feedback, as a result of Lithuania at all times criticizes Russia and Belarus, there are increasingly occasions within the nation that increase doubts about democracy. “Actions like this actually create a paradox. We criticize the Belarusian system, after all, rightly so. However at the moment, our police are very a lot working with Soviet strategies. There’s something to consider, even for the very best representatives of the Lithuanian authorities.\nI imagine that actions like this are a deliberate technique. That is deliberate and deliberate fear-mongering, which is designed to keep up the looks of democracy. A brutal and even violent act just like the one on Sunday reveals individuals what awaits them in the event that they attempt to act civilly, to exit on the streets once they must protest to do Individuals are afraid – Lithuanian society might even be probably the most afraid in the entire EU. When individuals sit of their homes, afraid to even make a sound, they don’t complain, the peace of their graves prevails, then stability might be known as and it may be stated that individuals are glad with the federal government and all the things within the nation. it is extremely good”, stated V.

    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. Video above: Large Santa Cruz waves toss kids The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, sister station [KSBW](https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-flooding-and-evacuations/46243230) reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Luke Littler has had a surprise meeting with Declan Rice and Aaron Ramsdale as the 16-year-old's rise to stardom continues.\nLittler has been a sensation on his PDC World Championship debut, becoming the youngest player to reach the Last 16 in the tournament's history. He comfortably beat Matt Campbell on Thursday to reach the next stage, dropping just six legs in the entire match.\n'The Nuke' has become a superstar thanks to his surprise run at Ally Pally over Christmas . It appears he has picked up two new fans from Premier League title-challenging Arsenal, as he prepares to find out who he will face next at the world championship.\nThe darts wonderkid posted a photo on Instagram on Thursday of himself posing with Gunners stars Rice and Ramsdale. The caption read: \"Just about to go to the room and the security says these 2 want a picture crazyyy!!\"\nFrom Littler's comment, it appears that the darts star was staying in the same hotel as the Arsenal players.

But the youngster will attempt to keep his feet on the ground ahead of his next appearance on the oche.\n\"Playing Raymond would be unbelievable. Win or lose, I’ll still be happy with making the last 16. I started crying when I saw my mum in the crowd. She was nervous. I saw her with her head in her hands,\" he said.\n\"I said to her: ‘The dream continues.’ She said the same thing. I only wanted to win one game and I've won three.

    "text": "Biden says won't pardon his son Hunter Biden's eventual sentence \"I will not pardon him,\" says Joe Biden after Hunter Biden became first child of a sitting US president to be convicted of crime. President Joe Biden has said that he will not use his presidential powers to lessen the eventual sentence that his son Hunter Biden will receive for his federal felony conviction on gun crimes. Biden, following the conclusion of a news conference held at the Group of Seven summit of the world's wealthiest democracies, responded on Thursday he would not when asked whether he plans to commute the sentence for his son. \"I'm extremely proud of my son Hunter. He has overcome an addiction. He is one of the brightest, most decent men I know,\" Biden said earlier during the news conference on Thursday. \"I abide by the jury decision. I will do that, and I will not pardon him.\" Biden's remarks came one day after the White House declined to rule out a potential commutation for Hunter Biden. Both the president and the White House have said for months that Biden would not pardon his son. Historic conviction Hunter Biden became the first son of a sitting US president to be convicted when he was found guilty on federal gun charges. He was accused of lying about his illegal drug use when he bought a handgun in 2018, a felony. He has long been the target of hard-right Republicans, and Donald Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. Hunter Biden's sentencing date has not been set, and the three counts carry up to 25 years in prison. Whether Hunter Biden actually serves any time behind bars will be up to US District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump.",

    "text": "It was a record-breaking day in Bakersfield today. 75 degrees is the new record high temperature for Dec. 29, breaking the previous record of 73 degrees set in 1956. Unfortunately, Friday was the last warm day of 2023.\nA storm system is making its way to Kern County, bringing with it scattered showers and lower temperatures overnight. Our temperatures are expected to drop to be more average for this time of year. Scattered showers are expected Saturday, and parts of the county are under weather advisories through Saturday. A wind advisory was issued for Western Kern County through Saturday morning, and gusts are expected to be around 30 mph.\nParts of the Kern River Valley are under a winter weather advisory through Saturday night. Although this storm system has a lot of activity, it should not be too disruptive for us here in Kern. Snow fall is likely to happen above 5,000 feet elevation, so we are only expected to have rain showers locally. Most of the county will get between 0.10 to 0.5 inches of rain.\nHigh temperatures for Saturday are mainly in the 40s and 50s. The Valley and Desert will see highs in the mid-to-upper 50s. Our mountain communities will be cooler with highs in the mid-40s. The Kern River Valley will have high temperatures in the low-50s.\nIf you are celebrating New Year's Eve, there is a slight chance for scattered showers on Sunday as the storm system finishes passing through. Stay safe and Happy New Year, Kern County!\nStay in Touch with Us Anytime, Anywhere:",

    "text": "Decommissioning chairman wanted to quit in 2001 after slow progress – records\nThe three commissioners ‘did not want to remain in Belfast beyond September’, a briefing note said.\nThe chairman of the body in charge of decommissioning as part of Northern Ireland’s peace process considered standing down from the role in June 2001 after months of slow progress.\nDocuments released from Ireland’s state files this year show a “downbeat” view of the pace of attempts to ensure the IRA and other paramilitary groups disabled their arms after the Good Friday Agreement.\nOfficials from Ireland’s Department of Justice and from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) met the three commissioners of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) on June 27.\nDespite six meetings with the IRA representative since March, IICD chairman John de Chastelain said that “we are no nearer actually decommissioning”.\n“John de Chastelain stressed that he and his colleagues did not want to be irresponsible or walk away from their commitments. But they had personal lives they needed to get on with.”\nHe also expressed concern about the commission’s credibility given “the impasse and growing unionist scepticism”.\n“They thought that putting the date in the public domain might produce a helpful jolt to the system.\n“Nevertheless, they were open to discussion on this. They understood that the governments might want the commission still to exist with a staff member there to answer the phones.\n“But the present three commissioners did not want to remain in Belfast beyond September.”\nMr Fittall noted that “their restlessness is something which we can exploit privately with Sinn Fein”.\nA week prior, Irish diplomat Niall Holohan recounted a meeting he had in Belfast with Clifford Garrard, who was Mr de Chastelain’s deputy.\nMr Garrard told Mr Holohan that the “waiting game” had been “an exasperating experience” for the commission.\n“Garrard was of the view furthermore that nothing less than an act of putting arms completely and verifiably beyond use would be enough to save David Trimble’s scalp on July 1,” the note said.\nIt added: “If David Trimble proceeds with his threat to resign on July 1 and the Good Friday institutions were to collapse as a result, it might prove difficult for de Chastelain to justify his continued presence in Belfast.”\nThe commission remained in place for four more years until it was verified that all IRA materiel was decommissioned.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/155/6.",

The Met Office has forecast strong and gusty winds across the county with a yellow weather warning in place from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday. This will impact south and east Norfolk including Acle, Great Yarmouth and Loddon. The warning follows a wave of destruction across the country [brought by Storm Gerritt](https://www.bing.com/search?q=storm+gerrit+edp24&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=1&lq=0&pq=storm+gerrit+edp24&sc=0-18&sk=&cvid=207F1D8E699B4A6F87978662640ADF75&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=), which [tore down trees](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/24013743.road-blocked-near-thetford-garden-centre-due-fallen-tree/) and left thousands of homes in Norfolk without electricity this week. READ MORE: [Rallying call to protect clifftop properties 'at serious risk'](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/24014365.plea-protect-properties-at-serious-risk-pakefield/) The weather over the weekend is expected to cause some transport delays for those travelling by either road or rail. The Met Office also said coastal areas and seafronts are likely to be affected by large waves and spray. This comes as recent high tides and winds saw roads collapsing into the sea and several home evacuations across Norfolk. Homes and businesses in the areas covered by the warning may also experience power cuts.",
