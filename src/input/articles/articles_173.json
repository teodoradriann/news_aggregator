    "title": "Unlicenced New York City Cannabis Sellers Fight Back - Benzinga",
    "text": "Loading... Loading... New York City’s cannabis market is yet again under dispute. New York City’s aggressive enforcement effort, “Operation Padlock to Protect,” has sparked significant attention and results. But, according to Newton’s Third law, for every action, there is an equal reaction. Well, the reaction has come: affected business owners are claiming the crackdown is unconstitutional. They are taking their case to court via through a class action suit, reported first The Gothamist.\nThe Action Unlicensed cannabis has been a problem in New York for quite some time. It’s not only about dispensaries that might not have all their papers in order but more about illicit shops selling cannabis. It’s been calculated that there are as many as 3000 unlicensed shops in NYC alone. So, authorities decided to put an end to this , and they came down strong.\nLeveraging new state laws that allow the NYPD and local sheriff’s office to padlock stores without a court order on the first inspection, they launched Operation Padlock . This initiative, presented in early May by Mayor Eric Adams aims to shut down unlicensed cannabis stores swiftly. Partial reports on the operation say that over 300 shops between May 7 and June 3 have been closed down.\nThe Reaction Of course, affected stores that might have been found selling a gram or two on the side, but made money from regular sources as well (as food and beverages) are not happy about the closure. Recently 27 businesses filed a class-action lawsuit against the city, arguing that the padlock violated their due process rights by lacking judicial oversight. The lawsuit seeks an injunction to halt these practices and demands compensation for lost revenue and damages.\nLegal Aspects Of New York Cannabis The enforcement effort is part of broader state reforms passed in April, aiming to regulate the burgeoning legal cannabis market and eliminate the widespread illegal sales that have plagued the city. The previous system, which required multiple inspections and lengthy legal proceedings, failed to curb the stores selling unlicensed cannabis across the five boroughs.\nUnder the new state laws, officers can immediately shut down any store posing an imminent health and safety threat, such as selling to minors or being located near schools. Store owners can request a hearing with the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings within five days, but these hearings often uphold the initial closures, leaving businesses closed for up to a year.\nWant to learn more about how this fight will play out?

Don’t miss this must-attend event in New Brunswick. Secure your tickets now. Very few spots are left. Use the code \"JAVIER20\" for 20% off!\nAttorney Lance Lazzaro , representing the plaintiffs, argues that these hearings should be conducted in a court of law with an impartial judge, rather than an administrative office controlled by the mayor. Other lawyers have also raised concerns about the NYPD conducting searches and seizures without warrants, and point to cases where administrative hearing officers recommended reopening, but were overruled by the sheriff's office.\nNew York City Cannabis Space New York City’s legal cannabis market is projected to reach up to $1.2 billion annually, generating around $47 million in local tax revenue. That said, behind this regulatory reinforcement, there is a huge business in dispute. In this context, the crackdown is beneficial to the licensed cannabis space and the taxes it will yield. ​\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs © 2024 Benzinga.com.

    "text": "NEW DELHI: Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips orchestrated a decisive 139-run stand, propelling New Zealand to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in the fourth Twenty20 international in Christchurch on Friday. Mitchell and Phillips' fifties not only secured the win but also put the Black Caps on the brink of a series sweep.The Kiwis were forced to mount a rearguard action after Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi knocked over New Zealand's top order, reducing them to 3-20 in the third over.Mitchell scored 72 off 44 balls and Phillips 70 off 52, accelerating over the closing stages to complete victory with 11 balls to spare, having begun their partnership in cautious fashion.New Zealand can wrap up the series 5-0 in Sunday's final match at the same Hagley Oval venue.Pakistan paid for their inability to support opening batter Mohammad Rizwan, who crafted an unbeaten 90 off 63 balls to dominate his side's innings.Rizwan found ways to keep the score ticking over against a disciplined New Zealand attack, led by seamers Matt Henry (2-22) and Lockie Ferguson (2-27).The 31-year-old threatened to reach his second T20 international century but was denied the strike over the closing stages of an innings that featured a relatively low percentage of boundaries: six fours and two sixes.Allrounder Mohammad Nawaz was the only other player to surpass 20 runs, whacking pace bowler Adam Milne for three successive sixes in his final over to post 21 off nine balls.Babar Azam, who scored half-centuries in each of the first three games, fell for 19 when he skied an attempted pull off Milne in the seventh over.Pace bowler Afridi had Pakistan right in the contest when he knocked over Finn Allen, Tim Seifert and Will Young cheaply and finished with figures of 3-34.Allen's wicket was particularly cherished following the opener's sensational 137 in game three on Wednesday.However, Mitchell and Phillips gradually pulled momentum back in New Zealand's favour and Pakistan potentially blew their last chance at victory when Sahibzada Farhan dropped a straightforward chance in the deep offered by Mitchell in the 14th over.(With inputs from AFP)",

    "text": "ROMPEU O SILÊNCIO\nEliezer rebate críticas após batismo evangélico: “Deus engajando”\nEx-BBB foi acusado de se converter “por engajamento”\nPor Redação\nO ex-BBB Eliezer usou o seu Instagram neste domingo, 16, para rebater críticas que recebeu após se batizar na igreja evangélica. Ele publicou um vídeo e fotos do batismo ao lado da noiva, Viih Tube, nesse sábado, 15, e foi acusado de se converter “por engajamento”.\n“Crente é hype porque tem muita grana envolvida por trás e político também”, escreveu uma seguidora em uma das publicações de Eliezer. Nos stories, o influenciador rebateu as críticas. Eliezer abriu uma caixinha de perguntas e um fã disse que ficou “bem triste” com as pessoas falando que eles “só queriam engajamento”.\n“Não fiquem tristes. Só quem vive o processo entende o que aconteceu ontem. O que espero do fundo do meu coração é que todo mundo um dia viva esse processo. Acho que tudo o que a gente já se propôs a fazer desde o começo do nosso relacionamento sempre vem com esse fardo, com esse comentário que é marketing, engajamento, então esse comentário de fato não diz muita coisa”, disse.\nEliezer completou: “E vou ser muito honesto com vocês, achei maravilhosa a repercussão, não esperava. Tanta coisa hoje em dia só engaja por ser ruim e ver o nome de Deus engajando é maravilhoso. Deixa que falem”.\nAssista ao vídeo do batismo:\nCompartilhe essa notícia com seus amigos\nCidadão Repórter\nContribua para o portal com vídeos, áudios e textos sobre o que está acontecendo em seu bairro\nACESSAR\nSiga nossas redes",

Yahoo Tech Take family movie night to the next level with this incredible $90 projector — a whopping $310 off Patrick Hearn · Deals Writer, Tech Updated January 5, 2024 at 11:53 PM Link Copied Read full article Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nWith winter's chill firmly ensconced outside your home, the best way to pass an evening is with family movie night — and what better way to take movie night to the next level than with this super-affordable 4K projector ? Normally $400, this baby is marked down to just $90. Yes, you read that right — that's over 75% off. You can get it for yourself right now at Walmart.\nHonpow Honpow 4K Support Portable Mini Projector $110 $400 Save $290 Under five pounds in weight and with a screen size range from 40 inches to 200 inches, this projector makes you feel like you have a movie theatre right in your living room.\n$110 at Walmart Why is this a good deal? Discounts like this don't happen often — usually only during Black Friday. In fact, this is Black Friday pricing, and Walmart apparently forgot to end the deal. We're not sure how long it will last, but at less than 3/4 the normal cost, it's a deal you don't want to miss.\nWhy do I need this? This projector has a lot going for it. Seriously, it's a bit of a powerhouse, especially for being so low-priced. To start with, it can reach 11,000 lumens of brightness. Each lumen is equal to roughly the light produced from a single candle. Rather than try to figure out that, take our word for it: this thing is bright. You can use it even in a bright room (or outside, once the weather warms up).\nThe 4K resolution gives you amazing picture clarity, and the projection range is as close as 4.9 feet or as far as 16.4 feet. The LED lamp is rated for a lifespan of around 100,000 hours. It even has cellular connectivity so you can screen mirror to the projector without Wi-Fi.\nPerhaps best of all, the projector is quiet. If you've ever used one like this, they can get pretty loud. The Honpow uses an efficient cooling system that keeps the fans quieter by around 80%, while also extending its lifespan to an estimated 15 years of use.\nBelieve it or not, this projector is over $300 off. Also believe it or not: It would be worth it even at full price. (Walmart) What reviewers say \"I absolutely love how clear it shows!! The sound is pretty good also! Great purchase! I attached my firestick and It is a definite WIN!\" one fan raved.\nAnother reviewer wrote, \"This projector is very easy to set up use. We usually keep a Roku plugged into one of the USB ports and HDMI for anytime we turn on the projector and also with the Roku powered on. It's really convenient and the screen quality is great as well. Very happy to buy it and we enjoy the movies for relaxing.\"\nAnother shopper gushed about the quiet fan. \"Projector works like a dream. Bought this projector for outdoor movie nights to view on an outdoor movie screen when our previous one stopped working. Fantastic picture quality. Best part is that the machine is quiet! No issues with a noisy fan! Would definitely purchase again!\"\nHonpow Honpow 4K Support Portable Mini Projector $110 $400 Save $290 Enjoy movies in stunning resolution at 4K, with a set of fans that won't drown out the projector speakers.\n$110 at Walmart Want to save even more?
