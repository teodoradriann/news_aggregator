    "title": "Maine awarded $425M for clean energy project in Aroostook County",
    "text": "By AnnMarie Hilton ,\n8 hours ago Transmission lines carry electricity from NRG Energy's Joliet Station power plant on May 7, 2015 in Joliet, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\nThe U.S. Department of Energy announced one of the largest federal investments in energy development in Maine, according to a Thursday news release from Gov. Janet Mills’ office.\nThe federal department is awarding up to $425 million to Avangrid, the parent company of Central Maine Power, in a capacity contract for the Aroostook Renewable Project, a proposed clean energy transmission line that would connect a substation in Haynesville to the Independent System Operator-New England in Pittsfield with a 111-mile transmission line with a capacity of 1,200 megawatts.\n“By expanding our transmission infrastructure, this investment can make the electric grid more stable and reliable and allow us to harness affordable, clean energy generated right here in our own backyard instead of having to import expensive and harmful fossil fuels from out-of-state,” Mills said.\nThe project could not only provide low-cost clean energy generated in northern Maine, but also more than 4,200 construction jobs and 30 permanent operations jobs, according to a news release from the U.S. DOE.\nBut there are still a few steps before the project can come to fruition. It needs to be approved by the state’s Public Utilities Commission and undergo state and federal permitting processes, as explained by the environmental advocacy organization Natural Resources Council of Maine.\n“Responsible development of new homegrown clean energy sources like wind and solar creates good-paying jobs, helps to stabilize electricity prices, and reduces the air pollution that is fueling climate change and harming our health,” said Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director.\nThe Maine Legislature approved a bill that was signed by Mills in June 2023 that called for a clean energy project in northern Maine. An initial effort to move forward with the project fell apart in the face of some local opposition, but the PUC restarted the process earlier this year.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Jennifer Hale, who is among the most famous voice actors out there, has commented on the ongoing negotiations and why it's taking so long to resolve. She told Eurogamer , \"AI is an existential issue for all of us.\" Hale is best known for voicing Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series, along with roles in Baldur's Gate, Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and Overwatch, among many others.\nShe said the \"repercussions are vast\" when it comes to AI, and this helps explain why the union and the video game publishers are taking their time to make a deal.\n\"I've been speaking to people on both sides over the last few months especially and there's a lot to learn on both sides,\" Hale said. \"Some of the decision makers in that room who hold significant power are at the same time quite disconnected from how production happens. There are also many in that room who are deeply connected to the process. So there is such a wide variety of agendas at play.\"\nContinue Reading at GameSpot",

The prototypes were developed by a research facility associated with North Korea’s Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex (UATC), the report said.\nBoosters are used for the launch of the weapons, while engineers are exploring various types of air frames, with one model apparently designed with four wings in a cross configuration, according to the report. Photos also showed attacks on various targets, including a tank that was hit at a steep angle from above.\n© KCNA North Korean drones are designed for both ground and naval warfare, have different ranges, and employ some form of homing after reaching the end of their programmable path, the KCNA claimed.\n© KCNA Kim stressed that the country needs to soon move from prototyping to full-scale production to be able to incorporate large-scale use of unmanned aircraft into its military doctrine, the agency added.\n© KCNA\nYou can share this story on social media: Follow RT on",

    "title": "Diaspora Minister: Harvard University a Synonym for Antisemitism",
    "text": " 10:17 AM EST Harvard University has become synonymous with antisemitism, and with a total moral collapse of core basic academic values that is spreading like wildfire on American campuses, Israel’s minister for Diaspora affairs said Thursday. The remarks come as the Ivy League school faces a donor revolt following the evasive congressional testimony of Harvard President Claudine Gay regarding student protesters' calls for the genocide of Jews, and the university board’s subsequent refusal to oust her. Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli said that all three university presidents who testified on Capitol Hill should have been forced to resign, even before their bitterly criticized congressional testimony, due to their failure to speak out against the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas. “Universities that were unable to issue an unequivocal condemnation of Oct. 7 are in a colossal crisis from a moral point of view,” Chikli said in an interview with JNS. “Moral relativism has created a moral abyss. Truth has become a relative term.” He advocated increased pressure “by all means” on academic institutions that tolerate antisemitism, adding that the strong backlash across the political spectrum against the presidents' testimony created an opportunity for change, and showcased the massive foreign funding of American universities by Qatar, which many Americans were unaware of. While the president of the University of Pennsylvania has stepped down from her position following her testimony, the heads of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology remain in their jobs, having apologized for their remarks. Chikli lamented the slide to “academic amateurism,” which, he said, was spurred by “a post-modernist progressive mindset, where equality and political correctness have overtaken merit, quality, and basic truths.” Greater Jewish Identity Amid Assaults In the interview, the Diaspora affairs minister noted that the antisemitism that has burst out into the open on American campuses since the start of the war against Hamas has led to a concomitant increase in Jewish identity. “We are witness to a dynamic in which anti-Jewish hate is leading to an increase in Jewish identity,” he said, citing a slogan that read: “The more you hate us, the Jew-isher we get.” The ministry is set to co-fund a $8 million campaign on campuses with pro-Israel partner organizations for Israel advocacy and is also working with the governments of Belgium, Denmark, and Italy against antisemitic activity. Chikli noted that many of the anti-Israel demonstrators shouting: “From the River to the Sea” have “zero knowledge” of the situation on the ground or the reality in the Middle East. This could give educated pro-Israel students an opening to influence people with their knowledge. Qatar Funding The wave of anti-Israel demonstrations, which have taken place at campuses across the U.S., including some with openly jihadist rhetoric, has exposed the vast amount of foreign funding flowing into American universities, with Qatar reportedly the single largest donor of any country, pumping in billions of dollars. Chikli argued that Israel should boycott Qatar, home to Hamas leaders who live there in opulence. He is pushing for a boycott, despite Qatar’s role as an intermediary in getting more than 100 Israeli hostages abducted to Gaza released last month in exchange for 240 Palestinian security prisoners. “It is because of Qatar’s support of Hamas that the hostages were taken to begin with,” he said. “I have zero faith in them.” Republished with permission from Jewish News Syndicate. - ",

    "title": "How the Eucharist came from Jesus' Sacred Heart",
    "text": "Two feasts that are intricately linked are the feasts of Corpus Christ and the Sacred Heart of Jesus. They are even celebrated within days of each other. This is no coincidence, as the feast of Corpus Christi was given an “octave,” meaning that the spiritual themes celebrated on Corpus Christi would remain the primary focus of the Church’s liturgy for a total of eight days. This was the case for many centuries, and during the 17th century, St. Margaret Mary Alocque had a private vision in which Jesus revealed his heart to her and said, “I ask thee that the first Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi be set apart as a special feast to honor My Heart.” It is recorded that she had this vision during Eucharistic adoration, with the Blessed Sacrament exposed on the altar. As a note, this octave is no longer on the calendar of the Church and the feast of Corpus Christi is widely celebrated on a Sunday, with the feast of the Sacred Heart on the Friday after it. Jesus’ heart Pope Benedict XVI commented on this link in his 2011 [homily on the feast of Corpus Christi](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20110623_corpus-domini.html): Everything begins, one might say, from the heart of Christ who, at the Last Supper, on the eve of his passion, thanked and praised God and by so doing, with the power of his love, transformed the meaning of death which he was on his way to encounter. The fact that the Sacrament of the Altar acquired the name “Eucharist” — “thanksgiving” — expresses precisely this: that changing the substance of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ is the fruit of the gift that Christ made of himself, the gift of a Love stronger than death, divine Love which raised him from the dead. He further explains how the Eucharist came from the love in Jesus’ heart: This is why the Eucharist is the food of eternal life, the Bread of Life. From Christ’s heart, from his “Eucharistic prayer” on the eve of his passion flows that dynamism which transforms reality in its cosmic, human and historical dimensions. All things proceed from God, from the omnipotence of his Triune Love, incarnate in Jesus. Christ’s heart is steeped in this Love; therefore he can thank and praise God even in the face of betrayal and violence, and in this way changes things, people and the world. The next time you celebrate either feast, recall the spiritual link between the two and how the Eucharist is a gift from the heart of Christ.",

    "text": "Reveló la fecha de su regreso musical: Raphael es dado de alta tras preocupar durante meses por delicado estado de salud\n“Quiero devolveros, en forma de canciones, todo el cariño que me habéis dado”, expresó.\nCon un emotivo mensaje, el reconocido cantante español Raphael compartió que ha sido dado de alta tras enfrentar un linfoma cerebral primario diagnosticado en diciembre del año pasado, cuando también se le detectaron dos nódulos cerebrales en el hemisferio izquierdo.\nEl artista fue atendido de urgencia el pasado 17 de diciembre luego de sufrir un accidente cerebrovascular mientras participaba en la grabación de una entrevista en La revuelta de David Broncano, en el Teatro Príncipe Gran Vía. Así lo confirmaron entonces fuentes de RTVE a Europa Press.\nY recientemente, el cantante español sorprendió con un anuncio tras meses de silencio: “Queridas amigas, queridos amigos, como muchas y muchos sabéis, durante los últimos cuatro meses he estado siguiendo un tratamiento médico debido al linfoma cerebral que se me diagnosticó”.\n“Con enorme emoción, puedo deciros que me encuentro muy bien y profundamente agradecido”, añadió.\nQueda menos de dos meses para su vuelta a la música\nRaphael aprovechó la instancia para dar sus agradecimientos. “Gracias a mi familia, mi pilar esencial, por su amor incondicional. Al Hospital 12 de Octubre, al Hospital Clínico San Carlos y a toda la sanidad pública, por haberme cuidado con una entrega, profesionalidad y humanidad ejemplares”.\nNo dejó fuera a sus seguidores ni a sus colegas: “A mis amigos, compañeros de profesión y a los medios de comunicación, gracias también por tanto cariño. Y, por supuesto, gracias a vosotros: mi público. Por cada mensaje, por cada pensamiento y por estar ahí, incluso en la distancia”.\nFinalmente, el artista español cerró con una esperanzadora noticia: “Me habéis hecho sentir muy acompañado y muy querido. Con una ilusión inmensa, hoy puedo anunciar que el próximo 15 de junio retomaré mi agenda. Quiero devolveros, en forma de canciones, todo el cariño que me habéis dado durante este tiempo. ¡Os quiero mucho!”.",

    "title": "Is Nashville ready for this weather? We asked the mayor",
    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Was Nashville ready for several inches of snow? First-time Mayor Freddie O'Connell said he thought so. \"The good news is we were prepared for this,\" O'Connell said. The challenging news is it's significant enough snowfall in a short amount of time, that no matter how much pre-treatment of the roads with temperatures this low it it just means that our roads are still treacherous out there.\" Watch in the player above: Carrie talks with Mayor O'Connell about the snow today and what to expect all week long. Plowing has occurred on many Nashville routes, but not every subdivision or neighborhood will see the Nashville Department of Transportation zoom by. The mayor said they have to focus resources on the most used roadways for drivers. Until noon on Monday, Nashville police had responded to three injury crashes but 21 non-injury crashes. NDOT has been out since 7 p.m. on Sunday and has been working with the Tennessee Department of Transportation for brine and salt. O'Connell said for those who need to get out to consider using a WeGo snow route. \"It's not like we plow once, and then the snow is all gone,\" O'Connell said. \"We have alignment within that with WeGo so that our plow routes correspond with transit routes for snow. I know that I've heard through the years, and when we have severe weather events like this, it can be helpful for people to know that they can use transit safely on those snow routes and not have to drive everywhere. It's a great option.\" However, Monday isn't the only day of the week O'Connell can think about. NewsChannel 5 asked if he was ready for the entire week to be challenging when it came to wintry weather. \"Yes,\" O'Connell said. \"We do have an incredibly dedicated base of employees across these multiple departments, some of whom are used to long hours and tough conditions. We're just so grateful to them that they have chosen these roles. I was out last night with a member of the Office of Homeless Services outreach team. We know the plow crews. We know that our Emergency Communication Center staff that work around the clock. So we think we have the capabilities.\" If you have a request for the city, visit [https://hub.nashville.gov.](https://hub.nashville.gov/s/?language=en_US) Where you can find shelter in Nashville Those needing a warm place to stay have a few options. Metro Social Services has opened it Extreme Cold Weather Overflow Shelter at 3230 Brick Church Pike. It will stay open through Tuesday morning at 10. You can get free transportation through the WeGo shuttle service from the downtown bus station on Charlotte Avenue. Carrie and Amy recommend: “Austin Pollack shows us the really cool art of Nashville artist, Herb Williams, whose work is featured all over the world. What really caught my attention was his story of being lost and found through his work after a personal tragedy. Heartbreaking and beautiful.\" -Carrie Sharp \" I loved the Crayon Artist story that Austin Pollack shared on NC5 This Morning at 9. He finds peace and therapy in immersing into his creativity, which helps him deal with emotional pain, I thought his art and his heart were beautiful.\" -Amy Watson",
