    "title": "Tempest Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Publication of Positive Data from Phase 1 Trial of TPST-1120 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors in Journal of Cancer Research Communications -April 04, 2024 at 01:00 pm | MarketScreener",
    "text": "Tempest Therapeutics, Inc. announced that Cancer Research Communications published positive clinical data from the dose-escalation Phase 1 trial of TPST-1120 in an article titled \"First-in-Human Phase I Trial of TPST-1120, an inhibitor of PPARa, as Monotherapy or in Combination with Nivolumab, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors\". The data showed that TPST-1120 demonstrated clinical activity, including tumor shrinkage, even in PD-1 inhibitor refractory and immune compromised cancers, and was well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. These earlier Phase 1 data complement the positive Phase 1b/2 data reported in October 2023 from a global randomized study of TPST-1120 In combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line patients with advanced HCC, which showed clinical superiority of the TPST-1120 arm across multiple study endpoints and relevant biomarker-defined patient subpopulations.\nTPST-1120 Phase 1 Study: In this first-in-human Phase 1 study, 35 patients were treated with escalating doses of TPST-1120 either as monotherapy (20 patients) or in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab (15 patients). TPST-1120 was well-tolerated as monotherapy and in combination, with a maximum tolerated dose not identified and predominantly low-grade toxicity. Notwithstanding the late-line stage of these patients and difficult to treat tumor types, clinical benefit was observed as both a monotherapy and combination.2 In monotherapy, a best response of stable disease (SD) was observed in 53% (10/19) of evaluable patients, with 5 of those patients staying on treatment for more than 5 months.\nTumor shrinkage of target lesions on treatment occurred in 21% (4 patients) and a best response of no target lesion growth was seen in 3 additional patients. In the combination therapy cohorts, including patients with heavily pretreated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the objective response rate (ORR) was 23% (3/13, all partial responses, or PRs) across all dose levels and 30% (3/10) at the two highest dose levels of TPST-1120, suggesting dose-responsive anti-cancer activity. These responses included a 50% ORR in patients with RCC (2/4 evaluable) who had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy, and one patient with heavily pre-treated CCA.\nAnalysis of whole blood specimens revealed changes in expression of PPARa-associated immune genes that were related to TPST-1120 dose levels. Some of these changes were only observed in patients who had partial responses, linking TPST-1120 biological activity to clinical outcome.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2024",

Otro de los dirigentes de la CGT, Pablo Moyano, afirmó que estarán en las calles. “A él (Milei) lo votaron para que gobierne y a nosotros nos votaron los trabajadores para que los defendamos”, añadió. En esta huelga que anunció la CGT contempla una movilización masiva al Congreso nacional y los detalles se definirán en una reunión plenaria que se llevará a cabo el 10 de enero.

Estas protestas concentraron a más de 20 mil personas, de acuerdo con cifras de los organizadores, que además reportaron que hubo seis detenidos durante un operativo.",

    "text": "The U.S. Census Bureau didn’t properly administer or monitor contract orders worth hundreds of millions of dollars dealing with advertising to promote participation in the 2020 census, possibly wasting taxpayers’ dollars, according to the Office of Inspector General.\nBureau contracting officers failed to make sure standards were followed to measure the performance of a contractor and didn’t receive supporting documentation for paid media invoices totaling $363 million, according to an audit report released last month by the watchdog agency.\nMar 28 US census changes how it categorizes people by race and ethnicity Immigration Apr 10 More than half of foreign-born people in US live in just 4 states and half are naturalized citizens “As a result, the bureau could have accepted substandard performance, potentially wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on advertising that did not fully meet program goals and reach intended audiences,” the report said.\nThe inspector general’s audit focused on $436.5 million worth of contract orders for paid advertising promoting participation in the once-a-decade head count that determines political power and the allocation of $2.8 trillion in federal funding in the U.S.\nOne example was an order in May 2020 to spend $2.2 million on flyers placed on pizza boxes that promoted filling out the census questionnaire online during the early days of stay-at-home orders issued because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bureau couldn’t provide supporting documentation showing that the flyers had been delivered in ZIP codes where the intended audience lived, the audit report said.\nWhile the findings in the audit report are valid, the communications campaign was a success despite facing many challenges, the Census Bureau said in a response. The agency promised to require documentation and agreed to provide necessary training to all contracting officers on how to monitor contractors.\nThe U.S. head count campaign was the first to encourage all participants to fill out the form online and also faced unprecedented obstacles in reaching people from the pandemic, wildfires, hurricanes and social justice protests that sometimes hampered census takers’ ability to reach homes, according to the bureau.\nThe campaign “increased awareness of the census and encouraged self-response through a variety of communication channels, successfully pivoting to use innovative communication techniques in lieu of in-person local and national activities,” the bureau said.",

    "title": "Venerdì 13 dicembre con il maltempo, ma la prossima settimana arriva l'anticiclone",
    "text": "(Adnkronos) - Maltempo oggi sull'Italia con piogge e temporali a causa dell'arrivo di un’intensa perturbazione in questo venerdì 13 dicembre e aumenta la parascevedecatriafobia: la paura del venerdì 13. Il nome deriva da parasceve (dal greco paraskeuḗ ‘preparazione’, negli usi preparazione al sabato, quindi venerdì) + decatriafobia paura del numero 13.\nAntonio Sanò, fondatore del sito www.iLMeteo.it, conferma che questa fobia è talmente comune da influenzare la vita di tutti i giorni di milioni di persone: sembra infatti che si esca meno di casa, con conseguenze sulla vendita di servizi e sulle abitudini quotidiane. La parascevedecatriafobia condizionerà dunque questo venerdì 13 perturbato, specie al Centro-Sud.\nNelle prossime ore le precipitazioni interesseranno soprattutto il Mar Tirreno, anche con locali temporali di calore fuori stagione, ma poi bagneranno già in mattinata il lungo settore che corre dalla Liguria alla Campania; nel corso del pomeriggio i fenomeni scavalcheranno l'Appennino raggiungendo anche Marche, Abruzzo, Molise e nord Puglia. La giornata sarà nuvolosa e grigia quasi ovunque salvo al Nord e in particolare sulle Alpi.\nIl 13 dicembre si festeggia anche Santa Lucia, con l’errato proverbio ‘Santa Lucia il giorno più corto che ci sia’: la realtà astronomica ci conferma infatti ogni anno che il giorno più corto (con meno ore di luce) è il Solstizio d’Inverno, sabato 21 dicembre nel 2024; ciò nonostante, avremo un po’ più di luce da domani nei nostri pomeriggi. Il tramonto più precoce cadrà infatti oggi, da domani il sole calerà sempre un po’ più tardi.\nIl weekend sarà poi all’insegna di una medaglia a due facce: il sabato sarà ancora un po’ perturbato, la domenica risulterà in prevalenza soleggiata. E’ confermato, infatti, che la ‘perturbazione della parascevedecatriafobia’ sarà rapida e porterà fenomeni diffusi solo fino al pomeriggio di sabato 14; in seguito troveremo residui addensamenti sul versante tirrenico in spostamento la domenica verso il Sud dove si fermeranno un po’ più a lungo.\nLa prossima settimana, infine, vedrà l’espansione dell’Anticiclone delle Azzorre verso l’Italia con condizioni stabili, asciutte e più soleggiate ovunque. Le temperature saliranno in modo deciso in montagna, vedremo anche il cielo azzurro e un sole presente più al lungo nel pomeriggio (il sole tramonterà più tardi): tutte buone notizie per scacciare i fantasmi della giornata di oggi, della parascevedecatriafobia di questo venerdì 13 grigio e perturbato.\nVenerdì 13. Al Nord: nubi, piovaschi e nebbie. Al Centro: peggiora diffusamente sulle regioni peninsulari. Al Sud: piogge forti in arrivo specie sulla Campania.\nSabato 14. Al Nord: molte nubi. Al Centro: piogge sparse sulle Tirreniche. Al Sud: piogge e rovesci.\nDomenica 15. Al Nord: soleggiato. Al Centro: piovaschi in Molise. Al Sud: instabile su Gargano e basso Tirreno.\nTendenza: prossima settimana con l’Anticiclone delle Azzorre.",

    "text": "By Lara Owen ,\n1 hours ago Don’t fall into the trap with your winter skincare regime Getty/iStock Winter’s harsh conditions – from biting winds and freezing temperatures, to blasts of central heating – can wreak havoc on our skin, leaving it dry, sensitive, and dull.\nWhile adopting a robust winter skincare routine is crucial, knowing what to avoid is equally important.\nStop slathering on thick creams, get SPF into your routine and more.\nWe asked celebrity dermatologists and skincare experts to identify the winter skincare habits to ditch for healthy, radiant skin.\nGet rid of heavy creams\nYou may think a rich cream will hydrate and nourish dry winter skin, but thicker doesn’t always mean better.\n“While a thick cream might feel luxurious, the real benefits of any cream come down to its ingredients,” explains co-founder of REFY Beauty , Jess Hunt.\n“Thick creams are often occlusive, meaning they sit on top of the skin to lock in moisture, but don’t always deliver deep hydration.”\nA cream’s consistency doesn’t equate to how moisturising it will actually be, and can often clog pores and trigger break outs.\n“Thicker moisturisers are useful in drier months, but you should ensure they’re non-comedogenic, as this prevents your pores from being blocked, which can lead to breakouts,” says Harley Street dermatologist Dr Ed Robinson .\nInstead, “look for those containing niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and ceramides to get the most out of your skincare.”\nRefy Face Sculpt REFY Face Sculpt, £38\nFacetheory hylauronic acid infused daily moisturiser Facetheory HydraOat Soothing Daily Moisturiser, £16\nDon’t banish your SPF You may think you can retire your summer SPF with consistent grey skies, but that’s a common misconception when it comes to curating winter skincare.\n“Those lovely winter walks with that bright sun may not be burning our skin with strong UVB , but the UVA is still interrupting, ageing and damaging our skin,” explains Ultrasun ‘s Abi Cleeve, founder of SkinSense .\n“Winter is when a lot of pigmentation is stimulated as our skin has not got the natural protection we build in the summer months, and can overreact to the sun’s brightness, causing pigmentation and dark patches.”\nKim Kardashian’s dermatologist says SPF is something that should never be skipped – no matter the weather.\n“Harmful UVA and UVB rays can reflect off snow and still penetrate clouds,” says Dr Simon Ourian . “I’ve seen first-hand the damage the sun can do – it’s always harder to reverse sun damage than it is to prevent it.”\nOn your face, you should opt for SPF30 or higher (and SPF50 during the summer months).\n“By using sunscreen daily, you help preserve your collagen, keeping your skin healthier and more youthful for longer,” says the STORY Clinic ‘s skin expert, Maja Swierczynska.\n“Go for a light but protective formula with pigmentation mitigators and hydrators,” says Cleeve.\nUltrasun SPF50 Ultrasun Face Anti-Pigmentation SPF50+, £32\nStop over-exfoliating When your skin feels dry or flaky, it’s tempting to exfoliate more often, particularly throughout the colder months when there’s a lesser risk of sunburn and heat sensitivity.\n“Many tend to over-exfoliate or don’t consider adjusting the strength of skincare actives through the winter months,” says Cleeve.\n“Make sure any more invasive skincare is still respectful of your skin’s natural biome – perhaps go glycolic for a while over stronger actives,” she says.\nOpting for chemical exfoliants as opposed to physical scrubs are always better for the skin. “Over-scrubbing can damage the skin’s top layer, leading to trauma that causes discolouration, acne, and irritation,” says Ourian.\nInstead, he recommends using gentle exfoliants once or twice a week.\nThe Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, £7.70\nStop using harsh cleansers You may think that your skin is hardier throughout winter without the constant sun exposure – but it actually has a heightened sensitivity, as you fluctuate between cold, damp weather and hot, dry rooms.\n“The biggest mistake is using harsh, stripping products that damage the skin barrier,” explains cellular biochemist and SEABODY founder, Dr Helena McMahon.\n“Winter skin is already vulnerable, and these products exacerbate dryness and sensitivity.”\nUsing fewer active ingredients (such as retinol, vitamin C, BHA and AHAs) will help minimise irritation. “A streamlined approach minimises stress on your skin,” says Hunt, “which is particularly important when the colder weather leaves your skin barrier more vulnerable.”\nSkinSense Purifying Double Cleanse SkinSense Purifying Double Cleanse, £28\nSEABODY Hydrogel Mask Cleanser SEABODY Hydrogel Mask Cleanser, £44",
