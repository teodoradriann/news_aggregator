On retrouve une richesse harmonique digne des plus grands micros. C'est sobre, fidèle et chaleureux.\nPour les prix d'occasion, on en trouve entre 200 et 600 euros. C'est une vraie affaire. La côte de ce micro n'est pas respectée car il a été copié par T.Bone et son clone n'est pas du tout semblable au niveau composants et prix.\nLes SE ÉLECTRONICS du début des années 2000 sont des excellents micros classés à l'époque dans le haut du panier et nombre de studios ont pu réaliser de beaux projets avec ces modèles.\nMagnifique modèle donc, à posséder pour faire sonner fidèlement n'importe quelle guitare !\nPour le chant, c'est bien, mais il faut le placer idéalement pour éviter les Sibillantes. Tout dépend du chanteur en face aussi.\nEn overhead, excellent !\nJ'en possède deux du coup et je viens d'en acheter un autre pour des cours de prises de sons\nMicro assez lourd, pas de coupe bas, transfo séparé pour la lampe.\nTiens la cheville d'un GEMINI, SE 5600,\n[Neumann TLM 193](/micro-statique-a-transistors-a-large-membrane/neumann/TLM-193/)...\nTop !!!",

    "text": "Dispute over mailed ballots in NJ county delays outcome of congressional primary Whether to count more than 1,900 mail ballots cast in one [New Jersey](https://apnews.com/hub/new-jersey) county will be up to a judge after their envelopes were unsealed prematurely and members of the local election board deadlocked on how to proceed. Superior Court Judge Michael J. Blee will hear arguments Friday in Atlantic City. The decision could affect the outcome of the [Democratic primary](https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-primary-trump-biden-menendez-kim-00fe6c8c88d64eeeecf8fae73bc67892) in the race for the state’s 2nd Congressional District, where businessman Joe Salerno holds a 400-vote lead over attorney Tim Alexander in unofficial results. At the center of the dispute is a state law that allows local election officials to open mail ballots five days before an election day. In Atlantic County this year, the envelopes containing the 1,909 ballots were unsealed about a month before Tuesday's primary, but the ballots themselves were not removed at that time, said Creed Pogue, a Democrat appointed to the county Board of Elections. The circumstances that led to the envelopes being unsealed early are in dispute. Democratic officials have described what happened as a mistake, while Republican officials say there are indications it might have been done intentionally to speed up ballot counting. The political and legal wrangling over fewer than 2,000 ballots, while a local dispute, also signals how carefully both parties are paying attention to the voting process this year and how local election offices are [under intense scrutiny](https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-voting-results-certification-trump-09bb9d1fdc11b495b7c50687e5576997). Similar problems surfacing during the November general election, especially if they occur in swing states where the presidential election is likely to be close, are almost certain to draw the attention of national campaigns and parties. Pogue said an error occurred when Atlantic County election workers were implementing a new procedure of adding timestamps to the inner envelopes containing the mail ballots.

Can they finally win?](https://nj1015.com/republicans-in-nj-pick-gay-pro-choice-senate-candidate-can-they-finally-win/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral) Previously, timestamps were added only to the outer envelope, which contains no information that identifies the voter. To improve ballot tracking, Pogue said, it was decided that a timestamp also should be added to the inner envelope. But the machine was still programmed to unseal the envelopes when adding the timestamp, Pogue said. At no time were the ballots removed and counted before the five-day window outlined in state law, he said. \"Because of no fault of their own, because of an innocent mistake, that should not disenfranchise a voter, particularly when there was no evidence of malicious intent, no evidence of any tampering,\" Pogue said. “We should, therefore, make sure these ballots are counted and the wishes of the voters known.” The board met on Tuesday, with Pogue and the other Democratic member voting for a motion to accept the prematurely opened ballots for counting while the two Republican board members voted against.

If it was a mistake, he said officials would have realized it immediately and stopped the process. Purdy said Republicans want the ballots, which were cast in both the Democratic and Republican primaries, to be counted. But they want an investigation to determine what happened, a plan to ensure it doesn’t happen again and for affected voters to be notified. Purdy said election officials were aware of what happened weeks ago and that public confidence in the election office has suffered as a result. He wants more oversight. “I’m not saying to throw these ballots out. I’m saying the election process was compromised,” Purdy said. “You can’t fix something unless you admit there is a problem and fix it.” In a court filing Thursday, the state attorney general’s office noted that state law was silent on what a local board should do if the inner envelopes are opened “intentionally or unintentionally” before the five-day window. The state has asked the judge to break the tie vote by the county board and decide whether the ballots should be accepted or rejected.

    "text": "GURGAON: The city's minimum temperature, at 8.4 degrees Celsius on Friday, saw a sharp 3.6-degree rise after hitting the season's lowest the previous day. It was 4.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The nighttime temperature was a notch above the normal for this time of the season. However, the India Meteorological Department issued a ‘yellow' alert for a cold wave in the city over the weekend, with temperatures expected to drop significantly. The city has not yet experienced any ‘cold' days so far this season. An IMD official said, \\\"With wind from the northwest direction at a velocity of 6 to 10 kmph, the minimum temperature may fall by 1 to 2 degrees.\\\" The weather is predicted to remain dry across the state. IMD categorises a day as ‘severely cold' when the maximum temperature drops below the normal by 6.5 degrees Celsius or more. A cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature dips below the normal by four degrees or more or is less than four degrees Celsius. Residents are advised to prepare for the cold wave and take necessary precautions to stay warm and safe during this period.Dr Neeraj Gupta, associate director of pulmonology, respiratory critical care, and sleep medicine at Max Hospital, Gurgaon, said, \\\"The cold waves are usually dry, and our body works in humidity. So, if you breathe in cold air, it will cause dryness in the throat and nose. Sometimes, it leads to bleeding from the nose and causes severe throat pain. If taken down to the lungs, it causes bronchospasm, exacerbating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Residents must stay indoors whenever possible and keep the room humid. Try to use oil-based heaters.\\\"",

    "text": "Gewerkschaft verkündet Tarifeinigung bei Dönerfabrik Birtat\nMehrere Tage ist bei der schwäbischen Dönerfabrik Birtat für bessere Bezahlung und einen Tarifvertrag gekämpft worden. Nun gibt es eine Einigung. Wie sieht sie aus?\nMurr - Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: „Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.“\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert. dpa",

    "text": "O deputado federal Glauber Braga (Psol-RJ) anunciou, nesta quarta-feira, 9, que vai fazer uma greve de fome até o fim do seu processo de cassação no Conselho de Ética da Câmara dos Deputados.\nGlauber Braga enfrenta uma ação movida pelo Partido Novo depois de ter agredido Gabriel Costenaro, integrante do Movimento Brasil Livre (MBL) com chutes. Na ocasião, o brigão do Psol também tentou agredir o deputado federal Kim Kataguiri (União-SP).\n“Vou permanecer nesta sala, no Congresso, até a finalização desse processo”, declarou o psolista. “Estou o dia inteiro em jejum e, a partir de agora, não vou me alimentar. Vou aguardar a decisão irrevogável. Vou permanecer aqui neste plenário. Quem quiser chamar de greve de fome, chame como queira.”\n+ Caso Glauber Braga: relator pede cassação do mandato do psolista\nDurante seu discurso na sessão do Conselho de Ética, o parlamentar de esquerda disse ter tomado “a decisão irreconciliável e irremediável de que não vou ser derrotado por Arthur Lira”.\n“Eu não vou ser derrotado pelo orçamento secreto”, prosseguiu. “Eu não vou ser derrotado pelo sócio minoritário dessa ação, que é o MBL. Eu sei o que está em jogo nesse momento.”\nAlguns minutos depois do anúncio de greve de fome, a oposição já reagiu. A líder da minoria na Câmara, Carol De Toni (PL-SC), e o deputado Carlos Jordy (PL-SP) publicaram um vídeo em que ironizam a fala de Glauber Braga.",
