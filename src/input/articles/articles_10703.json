    "text": "Editor’s note: [Community video shows Dexter police officers shooting man early Thursday morning ](https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/06/13/penobscot/penobscot-police-courts/video-christopher-hongo-dexter-police-shooting/) A 34-year-old man was hospitalized after an early-morning shooting in Dexter on Thursday. The Dexter Police Department responded to a report of a man acting strangely at around 2:04 a.m., and encountered Christopher Hongo at the scene, according to a release signed by Chief Kevin Wintle. Responding officers Wintle and Sgt. Gary Morin noticed that Hongo was acting aggressively and yelling at them, and fought against the officers while they attempted to take him into custody. According to reports, Hongo pushed Morin over a rock wall and attacked him. Morin then shot at Hongo, according to Moss. Hongo was transported to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. Details on the severity of his injuries were not immediately available. Morin and Wintle were both injured in the encounter, and were treated for injuries at the Sebasticook Valley Hospital before being released. It was not immediately clear how Wintle was injured in the encounter. Both Morin and Wintle have been placed on administrative leave, as is standard procedure when an officer is involved in a shooting. A press release sent at 11:31 a.m. was signed by Wintle. The Maine attorney general’s office has opened an investigation into the circumstances of the shooting. Further details were not available on Thursday morning.",

Aos 92 minutos, por fim, sorriu: Fofana cruzou da direita e Ronaldo subiu ao terceiro andar, bem ao seu jeito, para fazer o golo da ordem. O português, já se sabia, encerrou 2023 como melhor marcador do mundo, conseguindo desta forma aumentar a contagem pessoal para 54 golos. Só lhe faltou mais um para chegar ao objetivo dos 55 remates certeiros.

Apesar de alguns sobressaltos. Ronaldo ficou ainda perto de marcar em várias outras oportunidades, sobretudo na segunda parte, quando atirou uma bola ao ferro, que deixou a baliza do Taawon a tremer insistentemente, ou quando atirou em boa posição às malhas laterais. Enquanto não ia havendo Ronaldo, valiam as outras estrelas da equipa. Incluindo o também português Otávio, que fez o terceiro golo da equipa. Antes disso, no entanto, o Al Nassr até começou a perder, quando El Mahdioui abriu o marcador para o Al Taawon, de grande penalidade, a castigar uma falta dentro da área de Al Amri. Cristiano Ronaldo protestou muito e até viu um amarelo nessa altura. A resposta do Al Nassr, porém, foi imparável. Antes de mais, numa grande jogada coletiva, que começou em Talisca, passou por Ronaldo e acabou no golo de Brozovic. Logo a seguir, Talisca voltou a assistir e Laporte fez de cabeça o segundo golo. Já na segunda parte, Otávio fez o terceiro, coroando uma grande exibição: o internacional português foi enorme, em todo o lado, a recuperar, a lutar, a fazer jogar. Uma noite à imagem dele, portanto, que juntamente com Brozovic foi o melhor sobre o terreno. Otávio não vacila 😎— sport tv (@sporttvportugal) [#sporttvportugal] [#SAUDInaSPORTTV] [#alraawoun] [#alnassr] [#betclicsaudita] [pic.twitter.com/eEFto9DJBF] [December 30, 2023] Com este triunfo, o Al Nassr despediu-se do ano a ganhar e diminui para sete pontos a desvantagem para o Al Hilal, de Jorge Jesus.

    "text": "The Telegraph Greater Manchester Police is the only force to improve its crime investigation record Read full article Charles Hymas December 29, 2023 at 12:19 a.m. · 4 min read Chief Constable Stephen Watson pledged to investigate every crime however “minor” and attend every burglary when he took the helm at Greater Manchester Police in 2021\nA “back-to-basics” approach has helped Greater Manchester Police become the only force to improve its performance ratings for investigating crime this year.\nIn the space of two-and-a-half years, its chief constable Stephen Watson has taken the “failing” force that he inherited out of special measures and dramatically improved its ratings in two key metrics: investigating crime and responding to the public.\nIn 2021-22, Greater Manchester was ranked bottom overall, and judged inadequate – the lowest of five ratings – on both criteria, as assessed by Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary.\nWhen Mr Watson took over in summer 2021, he pledged to investigate every crime however “minor”, banned the practice of “screening out” weak cases, insisted officers attended every burglary scene and restored neighbourhood policing, or more colloquially, “bobbies on the beat”.\nAs a result, the number of offences resulting in a charge has jumped by 44 per cent, reversing a slump in solving cases that has fallen nationally to just one in 18, or 5.7 per cent.\nEmergency 999 answer times have been reduced from 82 seconds to seven seconds, putting the force among the best of the 43 in England and Wales for the percentage answered within 10 seconds.\nManchester is the only one of nine forces so far to have improved its official ratings for investigating crime and responding to the public in the latest round of inspections for the period 2023-25.\nWhere before it was rated inadequate, it has jumped two grades to adequate in both categories. By contrast, five forces - Thames Valley , West Midlands , Surrey , Merseyside and Durham - have declined when it comes to investigating crime.\nSix - West Midlands, Surrey, Merseyside, Durham, Dyfed-Powys and Suffolk - have been ranked worse on interaction with public.\nBack to basics Indeed, Manchester is cited by ministers as an exemplar of the “back to basics” approach that they want to reverse the slump in charging rates.\nStory continues With a record number of police officers after the 20,000-strong recruitment uplift and millions extra invested, they are clear the number of crimes solved must be “significantly increased.”\nA Home Office source said: “To help do this, we secured agreement from policing in September to always follow up every line of enquiry for all crimes – without exception. This approach recently led to a 44 per increase in charges in Greater Manchester.”\nThe new approach has been reinforced by data from force inspections which showed that more than half were failing to investigate crimes properly.\nFor the inspectorate, it is down to a combination of problems which have been particularly acute in high-volume crimes such as burglary and theft, where there are some of the lowest detection rates.\nAccording to inspectors, it starts from the point of a victim’s 999 call when they found call handlers failed to give advice on how to preserve evidence, meaning vital forensic material could be lost. Delays in getting to the scene within the so-called “golden hour” when evidence is fresh meant further leads could be lost.\nChronic shortages of detectives put newly recruited officers in the front line with no experience in making arrests, building case files or attending court, according to inspectors. It was compounded by a lack of effective supervision by more experienced detectives.\nRepeat offenders In his annual report, Andy Cooke, chief inspector of constabulary, was concerned at the failure to tackle repeat offenders . “Too often, people offend with apparent impunity, and the police aren’t targeting them consistently,” he said. “Some forces target repeat offenders better than others, but the vast majority need to make serious improvements in this respect.”\nThe National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) has responded with a pledge to visit the scene of every domestic burglary, and aim to do it within an hour of a victim reporting - as well as pursue every reasonable lead on all crimes.\nNew guidance has set out what investigations should include such as forensic tests, searches, interviewing neighbours and obtaining CCTV from doorbells or security cameras.\nA two-year trial of this new approach to burglary has seen Greater Manchester Police raise the proportion resulting in charges from three per cent to almost eight per cent.\nHow far the new focus on raising investigative standards succeeds in restoring public trust will be determined by HM inspectors of police. Next year they will be conducting a “thematic” inspection to assess its impact.\nTRENDING 1. A broken pelvis, a severed vein and a holiday ruined 2.

    "text": "In an era where the pursuit of wellness and longevity is more prevalent than ever, NMN supplements stand out as a promising avenue for those looking to enhance their healthspan. Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), a vital compound in cellular energy production and DNA repair, has garnered significant attention for its potential anti-aging benefits. With scientific research backing its efficacy in boosting NAD levels—a crucial coenzyme for metabolic processes—the intrigue surrounding NMN supplements is well-founded.\nAs we embark on this exploration of NMN, it’s crucial to approach the market with a discerning eye and understand the nuances that differentiate various products. This guide is dedicated to unraveling the complexities of NMN supplementation, offering insights on choosing the right product, and highlighting the top contenders in the field. Our journey through the realm of NMN supplements promises to be enlightening and aimed at empowering you with the knowledge to make informed decisions for your health and longevity.\nDecoding NMN: Unveiling Its Mechanisms and Benefits for Cellular Health\nNicotinamide Mononucleotide, commonly called NMN, is a nucleotide derived from ribose and nicotinamide. As a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a vital coenzyme in all living cells, NMN is critical in the biochemical processes fuel energy production and support cellular health. NAD is essential for functioning key enzymes that contribute to metabolism and DNA repair, among other cellular processes.\nInterest in NMN as a dietary supplement stems from its potential to increase NAD levels in the body, which\n naturally decline with age. This decline is associated with various age-related health issues, including decreased mitochondrial function, critical for energy production. By boosting NAD levels, NMN supplementation promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, enhances energy metabolism, and supports cellular repair mechanisms. Research has shown that cells can rapidly absorb and utilize NMN to produce NAD, potentially offsetting the age-associated decline in cellular energy and function. When evaluating the best NMN supplements, it’s essential to consider the broader context of NAD, the compound NMN aids in producing within the body. Understanding the extensive scientific research on NAD’s benefits provides valuable insights into NMN supplementation’s potential health impacts and effectiveness. Here are the possible benefits associated with NMN:\nLongevity Enhancement\nNAD plays a crucial role within cells by activating sirtuins, proteins vital for DNA repair, a process essential for maintaining cellular health and function. Sirtuins’ activity is strongly linked to longevity, as they contribute to preserving and repairing crucial genetic information. Conversely, low NAD levels are often associated with age-related diseases, underscoring the significance of maintaining adequate NAD levels for overall health and longevity. This correlation highlights the potential benefits of NAD in combating age-related health issues.\nIncreased Energy Levels\nNMN, pivotal in NAD biosynthesis, is associated with increased energy levels. Early studies and user experiences suggest benefits such as enhanced stamina and energy. With NAD levels declining with age, NMN supplements seem effective in raising these levels, often leading to improved energy and reduced discomfort. Preliminary research supports NMN’s efficacy in energy enhancement, particularly at higher doses, making it a noteworthy choice for natural energy boosting.\nRegulation of Insulin Levels and Diabetes Risk Reduction\nNMN may improve insulin sensitivity, facilitating the effective utilization of blood sugar and reducing the risk of insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. This aligns with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and metabolic balance, which are crucial for overall health. As research progresses, NMN’s role in metabolic health is gaining significance, underscoring its potential value in metabolic management.\nEnhanced Sleep Quality\nNMN is recognized for its potential to improve sleep quality, supported by\n research findings and user reports. Supplementation with NMN for higher NAD levels often results in better sleep and reduced fatigue, enhancing overall performance. Recent studies have indicated that NMN, particularly when taken later in the day, can improve sleep in older adults and reduce daytime sleepiness. This highlights NMN’s dual role in cellular health and sleep regulation, promoting restful nights and more active days.\nCognitive Function Improvement\nNMN supplementation is increasingly acknowledged for its cognitive benefits, contributing to a sharper and more focused mind. As a precursor to NAD, NMN supports brain health, with studies suggesting benefits in cognition and focus. Users frequently report a noticeable uplift in mental sharpness and concentration, underscoring NMN’s potential as a valuable aid in maintaining cognitive health and combating age-related mental decline.\nSelecting the Best NMN Supplement: A Guide to Informed Decision-Making\nNavigating the plethora of the top NMN supplements available on the market requires a discerning approach to ensure optimal efficacy and safety. Here are vital considerations to keep in mind when selecting the best NMN supplement for your needs:\n- Purity and Quality: Prioritize products undergoing rigorous purity and potency testing. Look for certifications from reputable third-party organizations to ensure the supplement meets stringent quality standards.\n- Bioavailability: Opt for NMN supplements that utilize delivery mechanisms to enhance bioavailability, such as sublingual formulations or encapsulation with liposomes or nanoparticles. These methods can improve absorption and maximize the supplement’s effectiveness.\n- Dosage and Concentration: Pay attention to the dosage and concentration of NMN per serving. While higher doses may seem appealing, starting with lower doses and gradually increasing as tolerated is essential to minimize potential side effects.\n- Additional Ingredients: Consider whether the NMN supplement contains extra ingredients that complement its effects, such as resveratrol or other antioxidants known for their anti-aging properties. However, be cautious of supplements with unnecessary additives or fillers.\n- Research and Reviews: Conduct thorough research and read reviews from reputable sources or trusted users to gauge the effectiveness and reliability of the NMN supplement. Look for evidence-based information and user testimonials to inform your decision.\nConsidering these factors, you can make an informed choice when selecting an NMN supplement that aligns with your health goals and preferences. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.\nThe Best 5 NMN Supplements of 2024 for Lifelong Vitality: An Overview\nIn the realm of longevity and wellness supplements, NMN stands out for its potential to boost NAD levels, a critical coenzyme in every cell of our bodies. With numerous brands on the market, it’s essential to discern quality and efficacy. This section delves into some of\n the best NMN supplements, highlighting their unique offerings and what sets them apart.\n- Wonderfeel Youngr NMN: The Premier Choice\n- Wonderfeel NMN Capsuls\n- Elevant Prime\n- Awakened Alchemy Revitacell\n- Mirai Lab Pure NMN 900 Plus\nWonderfeel Youngr NMN: The Premier Choice\nWonderfeel Youngr NMN stands out with its potent 900mg NMN dosage per serving.

For those seeking to elevate their health regimen with a product that delivers on its promises and aligns with higher ethical and sustainability standards, Wonderfeel NMN Capsuls offers an unmatched solution in the pursuit of vibrant health and longevity.\nElevant Prime\nElevant Prime is an NMN-C-based supplement that enhances cellular health and general wellness. Backed by a scientifically knowledgeable team like the experts at Wonderfeel, it aims to boost energy and strengthen immune defense. The product also explores the possibility of supporting heart health and regulating sleep patterns, though effects may vary by individual.\nHowever, with 125mg NMN per capsule, Elevant Prime offers a lower NMN content compared to many alternatives in the market. This aspect could be a consideration for those evaluating their NMN supplementation options, especially for individuals seeking higher dosages based on their health objectives or previous experiences with NMN products.\nWhile Elevant Prime positions itself within the NMN supplement market with these features, consumers should critically assess the product’s claims, dosage, and ingredients based on available research and in consultation with healthcare professionals.\nAwakened Alchemy Revitacell\nAwakened Alchemy’s Revitacell, similar to Wonderfeel Youngr, adopts a comprehensive approach by incorporating NMN and other ingredients. This blend facilitates cellular renewal and supports overall wellness without explicitly claiming the product’s effectiveness or superiority over others.\nComposition and Advantages\n- NMN Levels: Each dose provides 250 mg of NMN, considered low for full effectiveness but enhanced by additional supportive ingredients in the formula.\n- Inclusive Formula: This formula features elements that boost cellular vitality and extend lifespan, such as Pterostilbene, CoQ10, and Ergothioneine, also found in the Wonderfeel formula and Shilajit.\n- Wellness Emphasis: Designed to offer more than just NMN supplementation, a comprehensive health improvement option.\n- User Feedback:\n- Integrated Approach: Consumers appreciate the advantages beyond simple NMN supplementation and acknowledge its contribution to overall well-being.\n- Confidence in Purity: The brand’s commitment to the purity of ingredients and the efficacy of its product is well-received by those who prioritize a healthy lifestyle.\nMirai Lab Pure NMN 900 Plus\nWith a price point of $799 per gram, MiraiLab Pure NMN 900 Plus seems to cater exclusively to the ultra-wealthy, setting a new standard for premium pricing in the supplement world. MiraiLab, an early provider of NMN to the Japanese market, apparently hasn’t seen fit to adjust its prices over the years. Initially, the high cost could be chalked up to NMN’s novelty and production expenses.\nYet, one can’t help but ponder if they’ve overlooked the memo on reducing costs or prefer to keep any potential savings under wraps. While the product does promise high-grade NMN and a straightforward formula, the lofty price tag might make even the most health-conscious consumers pause and question the balance between value and luxury in their pursuit of wellness.\nComposition and Advantages\n- High-Grade NMN: Offers top-tier, pure NMN to bolster cellular function and energy.\n- Focused Ingredient List: Prioritizes a clean, NMN-only formula for those seeking a no-frills supplement.\n- Commitment to High Standards: Demonstrates the brand’s pledge to provide a high-quality, pure NMN offering, emphasizing its focus on excellence and innovation.\nUser Insights\n- Holistic Wellness Approach: Consumers appreciate the broad spectrum of support for cellular health and overall well-being.\n- Confidence in Product Quality: The emphasis on purity and high manufacturing standards resonates positively with users.\nTo guide your decision, here’s a recap of the standout features from the top NMN supplement brands we’ve explored. The NMN supplement landscape offers a diverse array of products, each with its unique benefits. However, Wonderfeel sets a high standard in the market with its blend of top-tier ingredients, forward-thinking science, and reliable consumer feedback. Wonderfeel Youngr NMN, in particular, is noteworthy for its potent formulation, offering what many consider the best formula for efficacy and quality.\nAdditionally, the adaptability of Wonderfeel NMN Capsuls, the comprehensive approach of Awakened Alchemy’s Revitacell, the innovative NMN-C in Elevant Prime, and the premium blend in MiraiLab’s offerings showcase the wide variety of options available for supporting health and longevity through NMN supplementation.\nFAQs About NMN Supplements\nQ: Is It Safe to Take NMN Supplements?\nA: NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) supplements are considered safe, with\nhttps://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/78/1/90/6532484 supporting their tolerability, even at high doses.

Given this gradual decrease, health experts often recommend initiating NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) supplementation during one’s 30s. This proactive strategy is designed to align with the early stages of NAD reduction, to offset age-related cellular changes, and to support overall health as we age. Starting NMN supplementation at this juncture can be particularly beneficial in maintaining cellular vitality and energy levels, thereby contributing to prolonged health and well-being.\nQ: How Long Does It Take to See Results from NMN Supplements?\nA: The benefits of NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) supplements typically become evident with daily and consistent use. While some individuals might notice early energy and overall well-being improvements within a few weeks, more substantial metabolic and cognitive enhancements generally require several months of uninterrupted daily supplementation. The gradual nature of NMN’s effects underscores the importance of daily intake to ensure optimal and sustained outcomes. Individual responses can vary based on factors such as age, lifestyle, and health status, making daily consistency key to achieving the full potential benefits of NMN supplementation.\nQ: What is the best form of NMN supplementation?\nA: Currently, there’s a lack of scientific proof to support the notion that NMN, when taken in sublingual or liposomal formats, provides better bioavailability than other methods. Predominantly, top research entities favor using oral capsules for administering NMN in experiments designed to boost NAD levels. This trend towards choosing oral capsules in scientific investigations emphasizes their effectiveness and the consensus on their use as the conventional method for NMN consumption.\nQ: Which brand Does David Sinclair Suggest?\nA: David Sinclair, a distinguished researcher in aging and longevity from Harvard University, advocates for the health advantages of NMN, recommending a daily dose of 1000 mg. However, he remains impartial and does not endorse any specific NMN brand. Sinclair emphasizes the importance of carefully selecting supplements that are well-supported by scientific research and conform to stringent quality standards, encouraging a well-informed approach to choosing NMN products.\nQ: What Is the Best Time of Day to Take NMN Supplements?\nA: It’s generally advised to take NMN supplements in the morning, aligning with the body’s natural circadian rhythm and morning energy levels, to kickstart your day with an added boost. While an afternoon intake can also be adequate and may suit some individuals’ routines better, the impact of evening or nighttime consumption is still under debate. The critical factor to remember is maintaining consistency with the recommended dosage, as this consistency is crucial for leveraging NMN’s full potential in enhancing your health and wellness goals, with a particular emphasis on its synergy with the body’s circadian rhythm when taken in the morning.\nQ: Why Opt for NMN Supplementation Over NAD or NR?\nA: NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) and NR (Nicotinamide Riboside) both act as building blocks to NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), a vital compound essential for numerous physiological processes. However, supplementing directly with NAD is less effective, as it struggles to cross cell membranes. This is where NMN and NR come into play, capable of entering cells and converting them into NAD, thus revitalizing our internal systems.\nBetween NMN and NR, NMN stands out due to its molecular structure, which facilitates a more straightforward pathway to NAD conversion. While both precursors effectively boost NAD levels, NMN is potentially more efficient for those looking to rapidly augment their NAD levels, making it a preferred choice for supplementation.\nQ: Are NMN Supplements Recommended to be Taken on an Empty Stomach?\nA: Experts like Andrew Salzman of Wonderfeel recommend consuming NMN supplements early in the day, before having breakfast. Given that NMN is water-soluble and doesn’t need fat from food for absorption, it provides the convenience of easily integrating into your morning routine. However, if taking NMN with meals suits you better for personal comfort or digestive reasons, that’s also acceptable. Numerous users have noted significant benefits from taking NMN with their food, indicating its versatility regarding ingestion timing.\nQ: Are There Any Side Effects From NMN Supplementation?\nA: NMN supplementation is widely recognized for its safety profile, with\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35182418/ indicating that doses up to 2000 mg daily are well-tolerated without any notable side effects reported. This robust evidence underscores the safety of NMN even at relatively high doses, providing reassurance to individuals considering its use as a dietary supplement. Given the absence of observed side effects, NMN represents a promising option for those seeking to incorporate it into their health regimen without concerns about adverse reactions.\nQ: Is it Possible to Take NMN from Food?\nA: Although certain foods contain NMN, the quantities are minimal and might not substantially boost NMN levels within the body. Integrating foods like edamame, broccoli, cucumbers, avocados, tomatoes, and mushrooms into your diet can enhance overall health and well-being.\nQ: How Can I Learn the NMN Level in my Body?\nA: Measuring NMN levels directly in the human body presents challenges due to the complexity of the task. Instead, assessing NAD levels offers a viable alternative, given that boosting NAD is the primary goal of NMN supplementation.\nNavigating the world of NMN supplements requires discernment, especially for those focused on improving cellular health and mitigating the effects of aging. The leading NMN brands can benefit from a wellness-oriented regimen by prioritizing purity, dosage, and personal health goals.\nThe Best 5 NMN Supplements of 2024 for Lifelong Vitality Conclusion\nIn health and longevity, the promise of NMN supplements shines brightly, offering a pathway to invigorate our cellular vitality and enhance overall well-being.

    "text": "El presidente venezolano, Nicolás Maduro, ordenó este jueves a la Fuerza Armada reforzar los «planes antiterroristas» en respuesta a operaciones que se han fraguado en las últimas semanas desde España y Estados Unidos contra su Gobierno. Durante una reunión con la cúpula militar, el mandatario dijo que «estamos derrotando al terrorismo, pónganlo allí en su curso de acción, (hay que) reforzar los planes antiterroristas que nos está enviando Estados Unidos. Con la (Agencia Central de Inteligencia) CIA, y España, con él (Centro Nacional de Inteligencia) CNI», Durante un acto transmitido por el canal estatal Venezolana de Televisión, el presidente Maduro instó a las fuerzas militares a intensificar la búsqueda. Además, la captura de «terroristas» y garantizar la neutralización de cualquier intento de imponer políticas violentas o sabotajes en Venezuela. LE RECOMENDAMOS LEER: Maduro acusa a la CIA y al CNI de conspirar contra la seguridad de su país Por otra parte, España ha negado que los dos ciudadanos españoles capturados en Venezuela, a quienes el régimen califica de terroristas, estén vinculados con cuerpos de inteligencia españoles. Además, Maduro insistió en que existen «pruebas claras» de los planes de la CIA y del CNI (Centro Nacional de Inteligencia de España) para desestabilizar la paz y seguridad del país. En respuesta a estas amenazas, Maduro ordenó al ministro de Defensa, Vladimir Padrino López, llevar a cabo una «reingeniería» en las Fuerzas Armadas.
