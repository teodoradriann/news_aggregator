    "title": "Has judgment begun in the House of God? Why have so many church leaders fallen?",
    "text": "( OPINION ) “Are all the leaders in the American church corrupt?!,” is a question I ask myself on an almost daily basis.\nNews seem to come out weekly about yet another major ministry figure in the church being involved in some form of scandal.\nThe findings released about Mike Bickle have left the entire charismatic world swirling.\nThe pain, confusion, and disillusionment that many are feeling in light of these revelations have formed an entirely new branch of quasi–Christianity I call the “antichurch” movement,\nwho pride themselves on their ability to “deconstruct” — which seems to always lead them towards the political left in the end or at least hobnobbing with it.\nWhile to some extent this is an understandable reaction to betrayal, I would like to propose to you a different way.\nIn order to discuss where we should go, first we must look at where we’ve been.\nWith so many victims coming forward as witnesses to abhorrent sins in leaders’ lives, we have to ask ourselves: How did we get here?\nTo figure that out, we need to look at where the current leaders of the church came from, namely, the Hippie Movement.\nPrior to the Hippies, America was a fairly conservative nation. But a counterculture began that encouraged rebellion against the values of the previous generation and instead pursued “sex, drugs & rock ‘n roll”.\nLike all sin, this seemed to start out great for them, but in the end, it left them feeling hopeless, empty, and broken.\nThen came the “Jesus People.” God began to call many in their lost and broken generation to Himself, and a revival started that produced most of the leaders of the Charismatic church today.\nWhile God can deliver anyone from the chains of their past, the devil is patient and tries to wear us down over time.\nHaving leaders with pasts filled with prolific sexual sin didn’t help the situation we find ourselves in.\nI’m not sure if every leader that’s being exposed right now started out with nefarious intentions or not, but I do believe there are several factors contributing to this issue of abusers finding safe haven in the Church.\nFor one, they seem very sincere when they preach.\nThis might seem like a minor point to make, but if you’ve sat under a leader who preaches about holiness and prayer with emotional passion, it can be difficult to imagine that they are living a double life.\n“If they were faking it, they wouldn’t be able to have so much emotion about it,” is the subconscious thought process most believers have — and that’s absolutely true because they aren’t faking it!\nI’m fully convinced that most of these leaders started out with a sincere devotion to Christ.\nAt some point in their journey, temptation came, and instead of resisting it, they gave in and the results of their sin are now being displayed for all to see.\nWhile it’s easy to condemn the atrocious acts these people committed (and they are atrocious and should be condemned), I think it’s important to realize that the moment a leader arises with a legitimate anointing on their life, all of Hell puts a target on them and gives a green light for their minions to attack.\nThe devil will surround a genuine servant of God with those he’s enslaved to Hell, and initiate strategies to get them to slip and lose their footing.\nOnce they fall, they become trapped and in many cases, they are most likely blackmailed and told to do what the devil wants “or else.”\nShould a leader who’s been exposed of abuse be restored to leadership after years of systematic predatory patterns are uncovered? Almost never.\nHowever, I doubt many people understand the level of pressure and demonic harassment these leaders endured for years and even decades before they gave in.\nWould you or I do any better? I hope so. People often medicate their pain with sin.\nRecent church history is replete with examples of leaders who weren’t abusive but were involved in affairs or other kinds of sin.\nSurely the Christian walk is a marathon and not a sprint, with many eager to catch a leader in failure so that their own promotion can come.

    "title": "How to watch solar eclipse, meteor showers and more in 2024",
    "text": "The night sky will have a multitude of delights in store for stargazers in 2024. Full moons and meteor showers will light up the sky. An increase in solar activity is expected to cause auroras that will create colorful displays. And eclipse chasers have been counting down to 2024 since the “Great American Eclipse” of 2017 — because a [total solar eclipse](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/09/world/eclipse-myths-history-folklore-littman-book-scn/index.html) will travel across the United States in April. Many nights, there will be opportunities to [spot different planets](https://www.almanac.com/astronomy/planets-rise-and-set) or [look for the International Space Station](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/) as it orbits Earth. Keep your telescopes and binoculars at the ready, and don’t forget to [snag a pair of eclipse glasses](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/world/solar-eclipse-glasses-eye-protection-scn/index.html) so you can safely watch the total solar eclipse. People are also reading… Full moons and supermoons Twelve full moons will occur during 2024, and September and October’s lunar events will also be considered supermoons, according to [EarthSky](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-a-supermoon/). Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit. Each month’s full moon is associated with a specific name, according to the [Farmers’ Almanac](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/full-moon-dates-and-times). But the full moons have a variety of names and meanings according to [different indigenous tribes](https://astro101.wwu.edu/indianmoons.html). Here are the full moons of 2024: Jan. 25: Wolf moon Feb. 24: Snow moon March 25: Worm moon April 23: Pink moon May 23: Flower moon June 21: Strawberry moon July 21: Buck moon Aug. 19: Sturgeon moon Sept. 17: Harvest moon Oct. 17: Hunter’s moon Nov. 15: Beaver moon Dec. 15: Cold moon Solar and lunar eclipses Multiple eclipses will occur in 2024, including two types of lunar eclipses and two types of solar eclipses, according to the [Old Farmer’s Almanac](https://www.almanac.com/eclipses). The most highly anticipated of these events is the [total solar eclipse occurring on April 8](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/world/next-solar-eclipse-2024-scn/index.html), which will be visible to those in Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun’s face. Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon’s shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon only obscures part of the sun’s face. A total solar eclipse won’t be visible across the contiguous U.S. again until August 2044. An annular solar eclipse will occur in the sky on Oct. 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow. Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America between March 24-25. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of the Earth. A partial lunar eclipse, when the Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between Sept. 17-18. Check [Time and Date’s website](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/2024#:~:text=2024%20Featured%20Eclipses&text=Year%202024%20has%205%20eclipses,eclipses%20and%203%20lunar%20eclipses.) to see when each of these eclipses will appear. Solar activity and auroras The sun is expected to reach [solar maximum](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/world/solar-maximum-activity-2024-scn/index.html), or the peak of its 11-year cycle of activity, in mid-to-late 2024. When the sun is active, it releases strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. The solar storms generated by the sun can affect electric power grids, GPS and aviation, and satellites in low-Earth orbit. These events also cause radio blackouts and even pose risks for crewed space missions. The [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/), operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado, will be closely monitoring the sun and release warnings and predictions about solar activity that could impact Earth. Scientists are eagerly anticipating what they could [learn about the sun’s activity by observing it](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/23/world/2024-total-solar-eclipse-guide-scn/index.html) during April’s total solar eclipse. A more positive side effect of increased solar activity, however, is the auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored lights in the sky. Geomagnetic storms driven by the sun in 2023 caused auroras to be visible in places where they are rarely seen, including as far south as New Mexico, Missouri, North Carolina and California in the United States, and the southeast of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. Depending on the location, the auroras may not always be visible overhead, but they create a colorful display on the horizon. Meteor showers The new year kicks off with a meteor shower almost immediately. The Quadrantid meteor shower is expected to peak between Jan. 3-4, according to [EarthSky](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-quadrantid-meteor-shower/). After the Quadrantids, there’s a bit of a lull in meteor shower activity, and the next one won’t occur until April. Fortunately, there are plenty of celestial events to anticipate during the long wait. Here is the full list of meteor showers occurring in 2024, according to the [American Meteor Society](https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/meteor-shower-calendar/). Quadrantids: Jan. 3-4 Lyrids: April 21-22 Eta Aquariids: May 4-5 Southern delta Aquariids: July 30-31 Alpha Capricornids: July 30-31 Perseids: Aug. 12-13 Draconids: Oct. 7-8 Orionids: Oct. 21-22 Southern Taurids: Nov. 5-6 Northern Taurids: Nov. 11-12 Leonids: Nov. 17-18 Geminids: Dec. 13-14 Ursids: Dec. 21-22 ___",

    "title": "Cabo Verde saca billete para octavos goleando a la Mozambique de Reinildo con un zapatazo de Bebé",
    "text": "Cabo Verde es la primera selección clasificada para octavos tras golear a Mozambique (3-0), un triunfo que sumado a la victoria en primera jornada ante Ghana (1-2) le dan la clasificación matemática. Los 'tiburones azules' fueron mejores durante todo el encuentro, sin dar prácticamente ninguna opción a los mozambiqueños. Bebé, jugador del Rayo Vallecano y conocido en el fútbol español por su facilidad para armar el disparo desde larga distancia, se exhibió en su mejor virtud, el tiro. Primero probó con una falta directa desde más de 30 metros, en este caso desde el sector izquierdo. No tuvo suerte, pues el balón se chocó con el larguero. A la segunda, en este cas desde una distancia similar pero por la derecha, el obús superó a Ernan. El portero, cariacontecido por el gol que había encajado, le intentaba explicar a su compañero Reinildo que el balón había llegado moviéndose de un lado a otro. Es decir, había caído en la trampa de Bebé y su característico golpeo. En el 40 el colegiado Samir Guezzaz señaló pena máxima a favor de Mozambique pero el VAR le avisó para que revisara la acción y lo anuló. Segunda parte de sentenciar En el 51 Ryan Mendes aprovechó un fallo de Dove para quedarse mano a mano y poner el 2-0, un resultado que viendo las dificultades de Mozambique para crear ocasiones parecía definitivo. Tanto fue así que Cabo Verde se permitió el lujo de reservar a Bebé, poco acostumbrado tantos minutos y tan seguidos. Geny Catamo, el joven de 22 años del Sporting Club, líder de la liga portuguesa, mandó un lanzamiento de falta al larguero. Poco después, en el 69 Kevin Pina, jugador del Krasnodar marcó con un potente disparo a la escuadra desde una distancia considerable. Parece que lo de probar suerte 'desde su casa' en Cabo Verde se lleva mucho. Cabo Verde es líder del Grupo B con 6 puntos y ya clasificado para Octavos, como primeros además. Egipto con 2, Ghana y Mozambique con 1 se le jugarán en la última jornada.",

    "text": "[luspagnolu](/user/luspagnolu)a [publico.es](/go/link/3969477) [#1](c1#c-1) Ahora se han humanizado, en lugar de robarlos proponen comprárselos, además prohibiendo el aborto y poniendo trabas a la educación sexual tienen la producción asegurada.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Es que no hay plata, y además, los niños ya están robados y no se van a destinar, así que ¿para qué gastarse la pasta?\nA ver qué dice el subnormal de siempre respecto a esto. Seguro que es capaz de decir que esos niños han sido vendidos y no puede pedirse su devolución o algo similar.\n[#6](c6#c-6) [#42](c42#c-42) [#46](c46#c-46)\nEn serio, por qué perdéis el tiempo con esta gente? Bloqueo y a vivir. Están aquí para joder, nada más.\nNo os llega con Ana Rosa, la Griso, Ferreras, Losantos, Herrera, ABC, El Mundo, etc? Aquí tenéis la oportunidad de taparles la boca a esta gentecilla que a saber por qué están aquí diciendo estas chorradas\n\"Según la organización pro derechos humanos Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, cerca de 500 bebés fueron robados por la dictadura a sus progenitores, en su mayoría opositores al régimen. En muchos casos, sostiene la organización, las madres que dieron a luz en centros clandestinos de detención y tortura, fueron desaparecidas para siempre, asesinadas o tiradas con vida al mar.\"\nengendros del averno\n[#52](c52#c-52) uff el cansino ese del mensaje kilométrico?\nEse también está entre mis excepciones, igual que el que repetía le mensaje en cada noticia del bitcoin.\nPero es que yo los insultos del calibre de este usuario es que debería estar baneado por el resto del los días.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Pero aún no tienes a ese ente en el ignore? si de cada 10 palabras 20 son insultos...\nLuego preguntan porqué meneame se va al garete..\n[#48](c48#c-48) No uso mucho el ignore, solo tengo a un usuario, el que no quiere hacer crecer a sus hijos en la miseria...\n[#27](c27#c-27) La cuestión es si es necesario un organismo solo para eso o puede derivarse a otro ya existente.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Vaya, qué sorpresa, uno de los seres con mayor nivel de miseria de esta web, y mira que el nivel es alto, alegrándose de que no puedan investigarse los secuestros de niños en una dictadura. Por lo que sea, eh?\nPues ya solo con el banco genético que ha creado ya tiene mayor utilidad que la que puedan tener 10000 seres como tú en 10000 vidas.\n[#31](c31#c-31) ¿Quién se ha alegrado de nada?\nResultados, hay un estudio genético, ok, ¿Cuales son los resultados?\nTu si que eres miserable...\n[#56](c56#c-56) Si tienes empatía, dona a una ONG o asociación que realice esa tarea. Que yo no quiera que esto sea financiado coercitivamente/via impuestos no significa en absoluto que esté en contra de que se realice la tarea, de forma privada.\nLa empatía, con el dinero propio, no con el ajeno.\nEl gobierno dice que el organismo actuaba \"por iniciativa propia, para la individualización de los responsables de posibles hechos criminales\"\nA los que defienden la libertad no les gusta que los organismos sean independientes, sobre todo estos organismos que TIENEN LA OBLIGACION de ser independientes de cualquier gobierno o ideología política.\nEspero que alguien viole la LOPD y ponga esos archivos a salvo\n[#70](c70#c-70) El liberalismo se basa en la moral como principio básico, así que difícil. Más fácil si eres socialista o fascista, que viene a ser lo mismo.\n[#53](c53#c-53) Lo que tú digas, se ha pagado de impuestos por 40 años la investigación de todo esto, más que suficiente.\n40 años después de la dictadura y después de 20 años de trabajo la verdad que ya deberían haber resuelto el tema... o la cuestión es perpetuarse como organismo? En Argentina no sobra el dinero público y deben recortar si quieren seguir teniendo un país habitable, pero algunos piensan que imprimiendo dinero se solucionaria todo, como los niños de 5 años...\n[#23](c23#c-23) Es lo que sospecho, se centran en el número de niños robados, los que reconocen ciertos organismos y los que reconoce el gobierno, pero ¿y los logros de este organismo? ¿cuál es la justificación del gasto? ¿Hay que soltar billetes aunque no haya resultados?\n[#4](c4#c-4) Ni de ti me esperaba defender semejante indignidad. Tiempo suficiente es todo el necesario para la resolución de todos los casos de un crimen tan atroz como es robar seres humanos. Y son cientos.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Semejante personaje despreciable. Como si fuera una \"investigación\" que tarda un tiempo concreto. Es un organismo que se encarga de hacer pruebas de ADN a la población para buscar familiares cercanos de gente que en la mayoría de los casos es por sospecha que puede ser un niño robado o los familiares terminan confesando...\nNo se puede caer más bajo que defender algo así.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No sé cómo te aguantas y llamas simplemente «indigno» a un saco de mierda así. En serio, todo mi respeto a tu templanza\n[#4](c4#c-4) Han tenido 20 años para investigar eso\nEso no es completamente cierto. En el artículo dicen claramente que fue fundada en el 92. No han tenido 20 años, han tenido 30.\nY teniendo en cuenta que 10 años antes ya estaba la Comisión Nacional por la Desaparición de Personas que hacía lo mismo y cuyas funciones luego asumió el organismo que ha cerrado Milei, en realidad han tenido 40 años.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Hace 40 años no habia la capacidad de hacer tests genéticos en cantidad, disponibilidad y coste como la que hay ahora.\n[#38](c38#c-38) Las pruebas genéticas para investigar la filiación con personas desaparecidas las lleva el Banco Nacional de Datos Genéticos y son gratuitas. Para quien tiene sospechas de ser hijo/a de algún desaparecido, quien realmente resuelve el tema es está organización, a la que cualquiera puede acudir y que además lo hace de forma gratuita. No necesitas añadir una capa de burocracia adicional en forma de otra organización.\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Nacional_de_Datos_Genéticos\n[#4](c4#c-4) Te voy a poner un ejemplo: España\nAquí hemos tenido 50 años (y contando) y todavía hay un montón de barbaridades que se hicieron en la dictadura de Franco que siguen sin saberse.\nY eso es así porque todavía hay gente viva y con poder, interesada en que no se sepa.\nY en Argentina, igual. Y esa gente con poder ha votado a Milei para que parara esas investigaciones, no sea que se descubra que algún heredero de una familia de bien resulta que tiene genes de rojo piojoso.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Precisamente. Este es de los que dice que no hay que reabrir heridas del pasado obviando que los delitos de lesa humanidad no prescriben\n[#50](c50#c-50) Viniendo del tío que llama fascistas a los que piden acabar con los difusores de fake news racistas, en realidad tu opinión respecto a esto se podía intuir. Has confirmado lo que pareces esmerarte en demostrar cada día; das asco. No eres más que otro ultra conservador sin escrúpulos, como tu máximo héroe, el sociópata Milei.",

    "title": "Ubuntu 24.04 Beta Released, This is What's New - OMG! Ubuntu",
    "text": "The Ubuntu 24.04 beta is now available to download — one week later than originally planned!\nUbuntu 24.04 will become the next long-term support release (LTS) and this beta will provide developers, testers, and enthusiasts time to try it out, track down bugs, and road test its new features.\nBeta releases are not intended for everyday use (i.e. you’re not supposed to install it as your main OS or on machines you rely on) but, that said, many folks do.\nThe Noble development cycle hasn’t been without its dramas and hiccups.\nDevs undertook the largest library transition in Ubuntu’s history (to mitigate the ‘year 2038 problem’), and the recent discover of obfuscated, malicious code in the Xz compression library meant every binary package in the Noble repos had to be rebuilt (hence the beta delay).\nBut chances are you’re not here to hear about all of that ; you’re here to hear about what’s new.\nAnd there’s a fair bit.\nUbuntu 24.04 Beta in Brief Ubuntu 24.04 Beta build Most people who upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS will do so from the previous long-term support release, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. As such, the cumulative total of “new features” will encompass not only the things added between 23.10 -> 24.04 but everything added since 22.10.\nI plan to run-through the cumulative feature set in a separate post as most people who read this site (hello 🤭) who are interested in testing a beta release are likely to be familiar with/coming from an interim release — making those ‘new’ features ‘old’ news!\nWhat follows is an overview of the notable changes since Ubuntu 23.10, which was released last October. If you use that release then all of the stuff below will be new to you.\nInstaller Improvements Automated installation is now possible\nUbuntu’s Flutter-based installer has been revamped with refreshed visuals and more intelligible text descriptions; the order of installation steps has been adjusted; and a new panel for configuring accessibility needs introduced.\nMost notable, Ubuntu’s updated installer begins a new approach to installation based on the concept of “provisioning”. As part of this, the Ubuntu 24.04 installer allows users to open a .yaml file containing a pre-filled configuration in order to automate deployment.\nApp Changes GNOME Games are gone Since 23.10, Ubuntu defaults to a ‘minimal’ install with only a small set of ‘essential’ software preinstalled. Those needing a fully-stocked offline-friendly install with apps like LibreOffice , Rhythmbox , GNOME Calendar , etc must choose ‘Extended Selection’ in the installer.\nUbuntu 24.04 makes changes to the apps in the extended install:\nCheese webcam app replaced by Snapshot GNOME games removed Thunderbird e-mail client now a snap package Otherwise, everything is as it was and every app has been updated to the latest version including the latest LibreOffice 24.2 series and the latest Transmission 4.0 release. This should ensure you don’t need to hunt down PPAs, Flatpaks, etc for newer builds for a while!\nGNOME 46 (some) notifications can now be expanded/collapsed Ubuntu 24.04 ships with the recent GNOME 46 release, a sizeable update delivering a wealth of improvements throughout the entire desktop.\nThere’s a set of super-charged new Nautilus search features ; a reorganised Settings app with new panels and options; collapsable notifications in GNOME Shell; support for remote login over RDP ; faster search in the GNOME Shell overview, and more.\nWelcome updates.\nFoundational Changes Performance tooling is now preinstalled in noble builds Ubuntu 24.04 uses Linux kernel 6.8 , the latest version at the time of release.\nThis offers a ton of improvements and enablements, but a few notable things: Intel ‘Meteor Lake’ CPUs now hit their advertised boost speeds; Nintendo Switch Online controller support; RFI mitigations to remedy Wi-Fi issues on some AMD laptops; and zswap buffs.\nThe network stack has been updated to Netplan 1.0 , enabling support for simultaneous WPA2 & WPA3 connections, Mellanox VF-LAG, improving VXLAN, and providing a stable libnetplan1 API .\nUbuntu 24.04 changes at-a-glance:\nDesktop installer updates GNOME 46 w/ updated apps Power efficiency improvements Big gaming boost Linux kernel 6.8.11 Mesa 24.0.3 Netplan 1.0 Performance tooling is now preinstalled GNOME Games package removed (full install) GNOME Snapshot replaces Cheese (full install) Thunderbird e-mail client is now a snap package (full install) A few things to be aware of when upgrading (from any version):\nYou still can’t install DEB packages using App Center Thunderbird DEB now a transition package which installs the snap The new Flutter-based Desktop Security Center tool in testing earlier in this development cycle isn’t present (not a surprise; there’s been little development on it in recent weeks).\nDownload Ubuntu 24.04 Beta You can download the Ubuntu 24.04 Beta from the Ubuntu release server right now for 64-bit Intel/AMD devices (a weighty 5GB in size). A pre-installed image for Raspberry Pi 4 & 5 is also available to download.\nAnd before you ask, yes: you can upgrade from Ubuntu beta to the final release. Simply install all updates released between now and then. By release day you will have the same set of packages as anyone doing a clean install (and likely a pinch of cruft they don’t).\nLike Ubuntu but with a different flavour? Beta builds of official Ubuntu flavours are also available for testing from today too.\nTo upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 from Ubuntu 22.04 you’ll need to wait until June unless you’re willing to use the command line. This is because Canonical only begin notifying LTS users of an upgrade once the first point release is made (and thus, the update is even more stable).",

    "text": "New Delhi : Shri Jayant Chaudhary, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), addressed a zonal conference for Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) at Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, today. The aim is to create awareness about outreach and the efficacy of JSS in creating self-employment and wage employment opportunities among socio-economically backward groups through skill development training. Moving beyond traditional skills, the conference also emphasized on the relevance of futuristic, industry-relevant skills and their role in better preparing individuals for the evolving job market. The honourable minister also inaugurated the exhibition of products made by JSS candidate from Delhi and UP and interacted with beneficiaries.\nThe Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme, originally launched as Shramik Vidyapeeth (SVP) in 1967, is a transformative initiative designed to provide skill training through registered Societies (NGOs) with full funding from the Government of India. This pioneering scheme targets non-literates, neo-literates, individuals with rudimentary education, and school dropouts up to class 12th, aged 15-45 years. By offering flexible, affordable, and accessible skill training, JSSs have become a lifeline for women, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), minorities, and other disadvantaged groups in society.\nCurrently, over 290 JSSs are functional in 26 States and 7 UTs including 47 in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and 3 in Delhi. Since the transfer of the scheme from the Ministry of Education (Erstwhile MHRD) to MSDE in July 2018, a total of 26.37 Lakh beneficiaries have been trained under the JSS scheme. The qualified beneficiaries consist of educationally disadvantaged and economically backward groups in rural and urban slums. In line with the key objectives of the scheme, many trained beneficiaries are women 21.63 Lakh (82.02%).\nSpeaking on the progress, Shri Jayant Chaudhary, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), said “”Aligned with the Prime Minister’s vision, we are dedicated to providing better opportunities for the youth of India. Under the JSS scheme, we aim to enhance capacity building and expand skill development opportunities among low-income groups. The processes of skilling, reskilling, and upskilling are essential for personal and economic growth. I applaud the JSS for recognizing the skilled workforce gap in various sectors and acting as a bridge builder, connecting talent with opportunity.”\n“The PMKVY scheme has already benefited over 97,000 people from Meerut and 1.4 crore individuals across India. Also, NAPS (National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) apprenticeship program plays a vital role in encouraging the employees to enhance their skill to match the ever-evolving industry requirements.” he added.\nShri Atul Kumar Tiwari, Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Government of India, added , “I recognize and commend the outstanding work of JSS in empowering the low-income communities in India. Through their strong community connections, JSS has been training the youth, especially women, in industry-relevant skills like marketing to not only increase their employability but also to bring about their holistic empowerment. I encourage them to continue this invaluable work and promote strong livelihood opportunities.”\nShri Kapil Dev Aggarwal, MoS (IC), Vocational Education and Skill Development Department, Govt. of UP. Member of Legislative Assembly from Muzaffarnagar Constituency , said “Our Honorable Prime Minister’s focus on skill development is unwavering. He consistently highlights the crucial role skilling plays in the growth of our nation. The National Education Policy 2020 emphasized the importance of vocational training, urging it to be embraced across levels from secondary education to high degrees. I acknowledge JSSs’ remarkable work in making skilling available to low-income groups. I persuade our young generation to adopt vocational studies and become job providers from job seekers for a better tomorrow.”\nA key strength of the JSS Scheme lies in its community connect and the involvement of local administration, village functionaries, and other stakeholders. This ensures effective mobilization of infrastructure, resources, and beneficiaries, enabling them to seek various job opportunities in various sectors such as food processing, textile, IT and more. Additionally, JSSs conduct activities to raise awareness on critical social, economic, health, financial literacy, and environmental issues.\nThe Zonal Conference served as a platform for sharing best practices, addressing challenges, and strategizing for the future. These conferences aim to enhance the implementation and outreach of the JSS Scheme, ensuring it continues to empower the targeted communities effectively.\nIn the previous financial year, the Ministry conducted Zonal Conferences from 13th March to 22nd March, 2024, at four diverse locations: Hyderabad, Goa, Udaipur, and Guwahati. These conferences reviewed the performance of JSSs and gathered valuable feedback and suggestions for improving the scheme’s outcomes.",
