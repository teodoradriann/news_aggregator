    "title": "Scientists discover protein that could fight ageing and prevent age-related diseases",
    "text": "An elderly woman’s hands.\nResearchers have identified a protein that could open new avenues for treating age-related diseases.\nThe protein helps to clear away damaged organelles, subunits of a cell which carry out important jobs within it and are vital to its functioning.\nTwo of them – mitochondria and lysosomes – help to respectively produce energy in cells and keep them healthy.\nDamage to these organelles has been linked to ageing and many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s Disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nIn a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists at Japan’s Osaka University and other medical schools say the protein called hexokinase domain containing 1 (HKDC1) helps to protect both mitochondria and lysosomes.\n“Modulation of HKDC1 function could prevent cellular senescence which is related ageing and age-related diseases,” senior author Shuhei Nakamura, who is a professor of biochemistry at Nara Medical University, told Euronews Next.\nCellular senescence is when cells stop dividing, which can prevent cells from becoming cancerous but contributes to ageing. Researchers have said that some studies suggest that preventing senescence may counteract human ageing and age-related diseases.\nThis study also specifically mentions that HKDC1 could impact lung and liver cancers.\n“Cellular senescence is implicated to have causal roles for many age-related diseases including neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, fibrosis and frailty,” Nakamura said.\n“So, the function of HKDC1 potentially impacts these diseases by preventing cellular senescence”.\nHow does this protein protect organelles? Mitochondria act to create energy for a cell. When they are damaged, they should be removed so the cell can survive.\nNeurodegenerative diseases can occur when damaged mitochondria accumulate, according to Harvard researchers.\nThe removal of damaged mitochondria happens through a process called “mitophagy” and depends on proteins called PINK1 and Parkin.\nThe scientists have now found that the protein HKDC1 and its interaction with another protein called transcription factor EB (TFEB) is critical for this removal of damaged mitochondria.\nThey also found that reducing HKDC1 interfered with lysosomal repair.\n“HKDC1 is localised to the mitochondria, right? Well, this turns out to also be critical for the process of lysosomal repair,” added Nakamura in a statement.\n“You see, lysosomes and mitochondria contact each other via proteins called VDACs. Specifically, HKDC1 is responsible for interacting with the VDACs; this protein is essential for mitochondria–lysosome contact, and thus, lysosomal repair”.\nThe researchers say maintenance of mitochondria and lysosomes was previously poorly understood.",

    "text": "di Lisa Ciardi\nDal circolo polare artico a Firenze, percorrendo a piedi 3.200 km, pari a 75 maratone in 50 giorni. È la missione di Matteo Bucci, 24 anni, ingegnere ambientale di Signa che ha deciso di lanciarsi in questa avventura per amore delle sfide, ma anche per raccogliere fondi da devolvere all’associazione \"Il pane quotidiano\" di Firenze.\n\"Ho iniziato ad appassionarmi alla maratona un po’ alla volta – spiega il giovane – partendo in realtà dalle due ruote. In particolare, durante il mio Erasmus in Slovenia, al terzo anno di Università, ho conosciuto un ragazzo tedesco che mi ha coinvolto in un primo, lungo, percorso in bici, dalla Slovenia alla Croazia. Poi mi sono avvicinato alla corsa e ho iniziato ad allenarmi per migliorare le mie prestazioni, partecipando a una prima maratona in California, dove nel frattempo mi ero trasferito per un tirocinio, sempre legato al mio percorso di studio. Un amico mi mandò un video di Russ Cook che correva attraverso l’Africa, raccogliendo un milione di sterline per beneficenza. Quel video mi colpì profondamente perché dimostrava la possibilità di spingersi oltre i propri limiti per una causa più grande\".\nDa qui all’idea di mettersi sempre più alla prova, fino al progetto \"Artic to Florence, dall’Artico a Firenze\".\n\"Partirò dalla Toscana in auto fra pochi giorni il prossimo 26 luglio – racconta – per guidare sino a Stoccolma e quindi raggiungere Rovaniemi, in Finlandia. Con me ci sarà anche il videomaker australiano Timothy Kerr che racconterà il mio percorso giorno per giorno, con l’obiettivo di aiutare la raccolta fondi. Farò ogni giorno circa 60 Km, divisi in tappe da 15/20 km. Dormiremo in tenda: quando possibile in campeggi e aree di sosta, altrimenti arrangiandoci per strada\". Il programma prevede di toccare otto Paesi, ovvero Finlandia, Estonia, Lettonia, Lituania, Polonia, Repubblica Ceca e Austria, per poi arrivare in Italia e raggiungere Firenze intorno al 20 settembre. \"Per l’ultima tappa – conclude Matteo – stiamo pensando di organizzare una corsa di gruppo dall’Appennino al piazzale Michelangelo, ma i dettagli sono ancora in fase di definizione\".\nTutti i fondi delle donazioni andranno all’associazione \"Il pane quotidiano\" di Firenze che dal 1898 opera a favore dei più bisognosi, degli indigenti, dei più deboli, per offrire loro sostegno materiale ed economico, avviamento allo studio e al lavoro. Attraverso il sito verranno poi vendute alcune magliette il cui ricavato permetterà di coprire le spese di viaggio. Per chi vorrà seguire Matteo e sostenerlo, tutti gli aggiornamenti verranno comunicati sul sito www.matteobucci.com e sui vari canali social.",

    "title": "Drought pinched Louisiana's crawfish harvest, but mudbug fans are weathering the shortage - The San Diego Union-Tribune",
    "text": "Feel free to change the headline. Stephen Smith is finishing video. Additionally, new crawfish photos should be uploaded soon. For now I am using filers. In Jeff Pohlmann's 39 years of selling crawfish in Louisiana he has never seen the industry face such an abysmal shortage of “mudbugs.” Driven by last summer's drought, extreme heat, saltwater intrusion on the Mississippi River and a hard winter freeze, the nation’s top producer of crawfish harvested a fraction of what is typical of the tiny crustaceans in a season — with tens of thousands of acres lost or failing. And while Louisianans are still buying and selling crawfish, a staple in Gulf Coast seafood boils and a part of Louisiana's “way of life,” the crisis can be felt across the state. “I’ve never experienced this before and it hits you in the pocketbook,” said Pohlmann. At the annual Louisiana Crawfish Festival in St. Bernard Parish, fans chowing down on crawfish pasta, bread, pies and etouffee said the crustaceans have been limited so far this season. Some said they have yet to attend a crawfish boil, popular during Lent when many in the heavily Catholic south Louisiana seek alternatives to meat. Pounds of the freshly cooked mudbugs with corn and potatoes are poured onto communal tables. High prices have meant that “nobody has really been boiling,” said Sara Garcia, a Louisiana resident who often attends the festival. Despite spring rain and the crawfish shortage, vendors at the festival were slinging droves of Styrofoam boxes filled with tasty red crustaceans, fixings and dipping sauce. However, many noted that the prices for a pound of mudbugs were higher than usual, which has been evident across the state. Around this time last year, the cost for a pound of boiled crawfish in Louisiana was between $3 to $5. While prices this year have slowly decreased since the start of the season, they still range from around $6 to $10 per pound, based on crawfish price indexes tracked by local news stations and vendors. Other places simply don’t have crawfish available at all. But the shortage isn't just hitting customers where it hurts. Pohlmann, who owns Today’s Ketch Seafood & Restaurant in Chalmette, said crawfish sales are 30% of what he normally sees. “When you look at the farmer and retailer, and I know the poor consumer wants to eat it, but we go to work to make a living just like everybody else does. So, unfortunately, prices have to be a little higher than normally what we’re accustomed to,” Pohlmann said. Louisiana generates anywhere from 175 million to 200 million pounds of crawfish — contributing $500 million to the state’s economy annually, according to Gov. Jeff Landry’s office. The Louisiana State University’s Agriculture Center estimates the potential losses to the state’s crawfish industry to be nearly $140 million. Earlier this month, Landry issued a disaster declaration for the industry, which is the legal underpinning that assists in securing federal resources. Typically one of the wettest states in the country, Louisiana saw some of its driest conditions last year. The soil where crawfish burrow to lay eggs dried out leading to a dismal harvest this season. “You don’t mess with Mother Nature, and that’s why you’re seeing these high prices,” Pohlmann said. “No rainfall last year and drought, and we’re paying for it today.”",

In an interview with China Media Group (CMG), Schwab emphasized China’s significance in a world that has transitioned from a unipolar to a multipolar reality. “We first have to recognize that the world has changed. The world has undergone or is undergoing those transformation. And here, particularly the transformation from a unipolar to a multipolar world. China has to play what I call and is playing a responsible and responsive role in this new global setting,” he said.CGTN YouTube Channel Got a comment?

    "text": "Up to 9 million Poles affected by obesity, study finds 03.07.2025 07:00 Around 56 percent of Poles struggle with excess body weight, and up to 9 million are living with obesity, a new study has found. Pixabay LicenseImage by Joachim Schnürle from Pixabay Forecasts indicate the situation will worsen, according to the study from Poland’s Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education (CMKP). By 2035, over 35 percent of Polish men and more than a quarter of women are expected to suffer from obesity, a condition with major health, social and economic implications. The findings, presented in The Social Image of Obesity report, were unveiled by Prof. Mateusz Jankowski, head of the Department of Population Health at CMKP's School of Public Health. He warned of a dangerous trend: since 1990, the proportion of adults with obesity in Poland has doubled, while the number of obese teenagers has quadrupled. Yet public awareness is high: 85 percent of Poles consider obesity a disease, and 86 percent believe it is a major health issue. Women were more likely than men to recognise obesity as both a medical and social problem. Reducing obesity rates could lead to significant health gains, including lower death rates from cardiovascular disease and cancer, and better overall quality of life. The report urges policymakers to make obesity prevention a national public health priority. The survey, conducted in May on a representative sample of 1,088 adults, found that most respondents correctly identified poor diet and lack of exercise as key contributors. But over two-thirds also pointed to hormonal and genetic factors. Awareness of obesity-related complications is generally strong as most people linked obesity to type 2 diabetes (81 percent), hypertension (79 percent), heart failure (74 percent), and joint degeneration (65 percent). However, fewer were aware of links to sleep apnea, endocrine disorders or reproductive issues such as polycystic ovary syndrome. When asked about treatment options, most respondents mentioned lifestyle changes, such as improving diet and increasing physical activity, but knowledge of other interventions was limited: only half were aware of bariatric surgery (weight loss operations such as gastric bypass and gastric sleeve), and just a third knew about the availability of weight-loss medication. Co-author Dr. Justyna Grudziąż-Sękowska noted that Polish attitudes toward obesity remain divided. While 46 percent of respondents said they support accepting overweight and obese bodies as part of physical diversity, 34 percent were opposed. Younger adults (aged 18–29) were least accepting of people with obesity. More than 40 percent of adults surveyed associated obesity with shame or a lack of self-care, with these views more common among men than women. The authors of the report called for systemic changes to ensure coordinated care for people living with obesity. This should include psychological support, dietary counselling, promotion of physical activity, and access to medical treatments, including surgery and pharmacotherapy where appropriate. They also emphasise the need for public education campaigns about the causes and consequences of obesity, particularly the impact of lifestyle and the potential for change. Grudziąż-Sękowska said that legislative reforms may also be necessary, in particular those that support healthier dietary choices and increased physical activity. She cited a need to reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods, sugary drinks and saturated fats, especially among children and teens. (rt/gs) Source: PAP",

    "text": "Power out throughout the city; Outage map shows 60,000 customers in the dark A short and furious storm knocked out power to more than 60,000 people in Tallahassee, according to the city's power outage map. That number rivals what the city sees during hurricane strikes or near-misses. [Sudden tornado warning sends parents and school district scrambling] The Tallahassee area is under tornado warnings as severe storms with rotating winds roar across the Big Bend. One tornado warning for northwestern Wakulla County and Leon County is in effect until 7:30 a.m. At 6:50 a.m., tornadic storms were located along a line extending from Midway to 14 miles southwest of Tallahassee. \"DANGEROUS SITUATION UNFOLDING FOR #TALLAHASSEE right now. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY! Multiple circulations and Radar-confirmed tornadoes apparent on Radar. #FLwx ,\" the weather service posted on X. The storms blew up at the same time Leon County High School parents were getting their kids to school. A school district spokesperson advised parents that tardies and absences would be excused and to stay off the roads until conditions are safe. One teacher at Leon High sent an alert to students saying \"there is no power at school. Do not drive in the storm.\" Many South Georgia school districts closed in advance of the storm, but Tallahassee was listed in a lower risk area by forecasters. \"ALL LCS Busses will be delaying pick up for elementary and middle school until the severe weather passes through our area,\" the district tweeted. \"Please monitor your email and our social media for updates. Our buses are parking at all the high schools to stay in place at this time.\" The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore tweeted radar of what he said were two radar-indicated tornadoes in the Tallahassee area. The tornado warning is set to end at 7:30 a.m. while a sever thunderstom warning remains until 7:45 a.m.",

    "text": "A postgraduate student in Michigan encountered a disturbing interaction whilst using Google's AI chatbot Gemini.During a discussion about elderly care solutions, Gemini delivered an alarming message, \\\"This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.\\\"The incident occurred whilst the 29-year-old student was seeking academic assistance, accompanied by his sister, Sumedha Reddy. They reported feeling severely distressed by the experience to CBS News.Reddy expressed her intense anxiety, saying she felt an urge to throw all of her devices out of the window, experiencing unprecedented panic.She further explained that whilst experts in generative artificial intelligence suggest such occurrences are common, she had never encountered such targeted hostility towards a user, noting her brother's fortune in having support present.Google maintains that Gemini incorporates safety measures preventing inappropriate, violent, or harmful interactions. Responding to CBS News, Google acknowledged the violation of their policies, describing it as a \\\"nonsensical\\\" response and implementing measures to prevent similar incidents.The siblings considered the response more concerning than merely nonsensical, highlighting potential risks for vulnerable individuals experiencing mental health difficulties.Previous incidents involving Google's chatbots include July's health-related misinformation, where AI provided dangerous advice including suggesting rock consumption for nutritional benefits.Google subsequently restricted humour sites in health information and removed viral problematic search results.Other AI platforms have faced similar issues. In February, Character.AI and Google faced legal action from a Florida mother whose 14-year-old son died by suicide, allegedly influenced by chatbot interactions. Additionally, OpenAI's ChatGPT has demonstrated errors and fabrications termed \\\"hallucinations\\\". Specialists warn of AI systems' potential dangers, including misinformation dissemination and historical revisionism.",
