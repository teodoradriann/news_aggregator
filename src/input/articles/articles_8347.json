    "text": "The series of serious cases of diarrhoea in northern France, with 29 children affected and one death, was caused by bacterially contaminated meat, officials said on Wednesday. Prefecture officials in the town of Saint-Quentin said the meat was distributed via five butcher's shops that have since been closed by the authorities, following analyses by the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Investigations into all the butcher shops concerned are continuing and the results will be forwarded to the public prosecutor's office in Paris to identify those responsible. In addition to the children, one pensioner also fell ill. A rare form of acute kidney failure occurred in 10 of those affected, from which one 12-year-old died. The children developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which usually occurs as a result of an intestinal infection and leads to the formation of blood clots that block the brain, heart and kidneys in particular. The wave of the disease caused great concern in Saint-Quentin, a town of 53,000 inhabitants. The town set up a crisis hotline. Parents were called to alert the emergency services if children had severe diarrhoea. Anyone who still has frozen meat from one of the butcher's shops at home should dispose of it and clean their fridge thoroughly, the authorities recommended.",

    "text": "Researchers at Stanford Medicine are using virtual reality to help those who suffer from hoarding disorder.\nCarolyn Rodriguez and her team created a virtual home using scans of participants’ actual possessions. These virtual environments were then loaded into a VR headset.\n“They can actually practice letting go of items, and this can be a stepping stone to real-life discarding,” said Rodriguez, a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine and director of the Hoarding Disorders Research Program.\n“Individuals with hoarding disorder have difficulty letting go of their possessions. Letting go can range from discarding, donating, recycling, and that act of parting with their possessions causes them to have a lot of distress,” she said.\n@scrippsnews Researchers at Stanford University have developed a way to help those suffering from #HoardingDisorder , by recreating their belongings using #VirtualReality . This way, users can practice throwing away items virtually before doing the real thing. #research #news ♬ original sound - Scripps News\nAn estimated 2% to 6% of the population suffers from hoarding disorder, according to the International OCD Foundation .\nSymptoms are almost three times more common in older adults.\nSome symptoms of hoarding disorder include inability to get rid of possessions, extreme stress when attempting to throw out items, and not trusting others to touch your possessions, according to the Cleveland Clinic .\n“The VR sessions were well-tolerated and participants found them useful. And nearly all of the participants then said that the VR actually helped them increase real-life discarding,” Rodriguez said.\n“In many cases home visits are not feasible. Either individuals live too far away or their home has too much clutter, it’s above shoulder-level or higher, and it can be dangerous,” she explained.\nThe team completed a pilot study last year with 9 participants. Along with VR, participants attended 16 weeks of online group therapy that gave them hoarding-related cognitive behavioral skills. Seven of the nine participants showed improvement.\nRodriguez hopes as virtual and augmented reality technology advances, this will be more feasible to implement along with other therapies currently used to help hoarding disorder.\n“The best evidence that we have supports cognitive behavioral therapy for hoarding disorder,” Rodriguez said.\nShe explained that if you have a loved one who deals with hoarding disorder, it’s important to express empathy and praise progress.\nSEE MORE: Nearly 200 animals seized, Las Vegas couple charged for animal cruelty",

    "title": "Missile defence successes in Gulf, Ukraine fuel global urgency to acquire systems - MarketScreener",
    "text": "May 3 (Reuters) - The success of ballistic missile defences facing their first complex, high-stakes combat scenarios in Israel, the Red Sea and Ukraine will encourage militaries globally to invest in the pricey systems, experts say - and intensify missile arms races.\nIran launched as many as 120 intermediate-range ballistic missiles at Israel on April 13, U.S. and Israeli officials say. U.S. SM-3 and Israeli Arrow interceptors destroyed nearly all of them, leaving drones and smaller threats to the Iron Dome system.\nIn previous months, interceptors fired from U.S. Navy destroyers stopped Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles, while in Ukraine, U.S.-made MIM-104 Patriot batteries have shot down advanced Russian Iskander and Khinzal missiles.\nReuters spoke with six experts who said more militaries would look to invest in ballistic missile defence, a potential windfall for companies such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which build those types of systems.\n\"It's undeniable that any wealthy country with the technological wherewithal will continue to invest in missile defence,\" said Ankit Panda of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a defence and security think tank. \"All of this is a recipe for a conventional arms race.\"\nEuropean countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Poland already operate RTX subsidiary Raytheon's Patriot batteries, the most common Western advanced ballistic missile defence system.\nSaudi Arabia has used its Patriots for years to defend against Houthi attacks; it and the United Arab Emirates also operate the Lockheed Martin Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain have Patriot batteries as well, and Oman has expressed interest in missile defence.\nIn the U.S., Lockheed Martin in April won a $17.7 billion contract for a next-generation interceptor for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program - designed to shoot down small numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) aimed at the continental United States.\nBut the impact may be most acute in Asia, where China has invested heavily in conventionally armed ballistic missiles. A 2023 Pentagon report said the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force has about 500 DF-26 missiles, designed to accurately strike targets thousands of kilometres away.\nThat puts U.S. and allied bases in Japan and Guam within range of an attack that may only come with 20 to 30 minutes' warning.\n\"In the Pacific, you’ll see further interest in missile defence, which will push the Chinese to build more systems,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. \"Countries will want to acquire (offensive) missiles because they see other countries using them ... That will drive up demand for missile defences.\"\nU.S. Indo-Pacific Command and China's Ministry of Defence did not respond to requests for comment.\nChina rarely discusses its missile arsenal beyond statements that its forces are meant to preserve peace and are not aimed at any specific country.\nRaytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson referred questions to the company's first-quarter earnings briefing in late April, in which it said it continued to lead the industry in \"missile defence missions, which, given world events, are becoming more critical than ever\".\nDOLLAR SIGNS\nBallistic missile defence works by spotting an attacking weapon either at launch or in flight, then using a surface-based radar to guide an interceptor to the target.\nInterceptions can occur in the atmosphere or in space, and each domain requires different hardware. For instance, fins won't work outside the atmosphere - interceptors must have small steering rockets to function there.\nThe necessary high-powered computers, far-seeing radars and missiles as large as telephone poles are not cheap, together stretching into the billions. In 2022, for example, the U.S. approved the sale of both Patriots and THAAD systems to Saudi Arabia, in deals worth as much as $5.3 billion.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, wealthier countries such as Japan, Australia and South Korea are prime candidates for missile defence, Lewis said, while nearly every country in Asia is already investing in missiles.\nJapan's defence ministry said the country \"needs to fundamentally and swiftly reinforce its defence capabilities, including integrated air and missile defence\". It said it is investing in improved Patriot missiles, better radars and enhanced naval anti-missile capabilities.\nIn its latest defence budget, South Korea increased funding by 12% for its Korea Air and Missile Defense System to expand it \"from the existing lower-level defence concept,\" the country's defence ministry said in a statement.\n\"Cases such as the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war have reaffirmed the importance of a 'ballistic missile defence system' to respond to increasingly sophisticated missile threats,\" the ministry said.\nIn mid-April, Australia announced a A$500 million ($328 million) contract with Lockheed Martin to deliver its Joint Air Battle Management System for tracking and destroying aircraft and missiles.\nThe cost of a ballistic missile is often much cheaper than the system meant to stop it.\nBut that isn't the right way to consider cost, said Yoji Koda, former commander in chief of Japan's Self-Defense Fleet, and an advocate of stronger missile defences in his country.\n\"In a war economy, the cheaper the better. But sometimes what is necessary, is we need to protect key infrastructure, or key command centres, at any cost. Because without them we would lose.\"\nTHE CHINA QUESTION\nMost of China's conventionally armed ballistic missiles are designed to hit targets on land.\nBut it also fields steerable warheads meant to hit ships at sea, including the DF-21D and variants of the DF-26, developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.\nSuch anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) had never been used in combat until late 2023, when Houthi forces in Yemen began firing Iranian-made models at ships in the Red Sea.\nBetween November - the first documented use - and April, U.S. Central Command reported at least 85 ASBMs fired in the region, with 20 interceptions and one civilian ship reported sunk.\nCENTCOM has declined to provide specifics about the effectiveness of Iranian ASBMs but has noted missiles posing no threat were not engaged and most that were not intercepted landed harmlessly.\nThe effectiveness of missile defences on land and at sea will catch China's attention, said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program and Carnegie China.\n\"It raises the possibility that the U.S. and its allies could depend on missile defence significantly against a ballistic missile attack,\" Zhao said.\nAlthough the technical specifics of China's missiles are closely held secrets, the country's heavy investment means they are likely to be more reliable, and are widely believed to use complex countermeasures to complicate interception.\n\"For opponents such as China which have missile stockpiles an order of magnitude larger than that of Russia or Iran and which field more sophisticated systems ... it's not clear that the lessons learned invalidate existing operational constructs,\" said Sidarth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\nBut the political and practical incentives to invest in missile defence will be too attractive for many countries to ignore, Lewis said.\n\"All defence procurement decisions are ultimately about politics,\" he said. \"The politics of this stuff is really simple: do you want to defend the country or not? And the winning answer is always 'Yes'.\" ($1 = 1.5225 Australian dollars)\n(Reporting by Gerry Doyle.

    "text": "Get ready for another very warm weekend across the state as highs climb well into the 70s and 80s just about statewide. A few places on the southeast plains will approach 90 degrees! Even the mountains are warm with highs well into the 60s as high as tree line. To put this into perspective, the average high in Denver for Oct. 12 is 67 degrees. Skies will be hazy in northern Colorado this weekend due to wildfire smoke coming from fires in Utah and Wyoming. We'll also see some afternoon clouds today with the approach of a weak, but dry, cold front. That front will cool us down a few degrees on Sunday. Here's a look ahead: SATURDAY: Very warm and breezy with afternoon clouds. Continued dry. High 81, low 46. SUNDAY: Still warm and dry but a touch cooler. High 75, low 45. MONDAY: Mostly sunny and very warm with a high around 80. Mostly clear at night, low 47. TUESDAY: Mostly sunny and warm, high 78. Mostly clear overnight, low 45. WEDNESDAY: Continued very warm with elevated fire danger, high 80. Partly cloudy overnight, low 48. THURSDAY: Breezy and still quite warm, high 78. Partly cloudy overnight, low 50. FRIDAY: Potentially turning cooler with a slight chance for afternoon rain showers, high 66. Cloudy overnight 35.",

    "text": "Côte d'Ivoire : Amélioration de l'alimentation des élèves, Kandia Camara offre 20 sacs de riz de 25 kg aux cantines scolaires de la DRENA 4 d'Abobo Centre\nLe 5 décembre 2024, Alioune Bakayoko, conseiller municipal à[ Abobo](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+Abobo), a procédé à la remise d’une demie tonne de riz à la Direction régionale de l’Éducation nationale d’Abidjan (DRENA 4), une action initiée par[ Kandia Camara](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+Kandia+Camara) Kamissoko, présidente du Sénat et maire d’Abobo. Ce geste vise à soutenir l’alimentation des[ élèves](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+%C3%A9l%C3%A8ves) dans les[ cantines](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+cantines)[ scolaires](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+scolaires) de la commune, avant de mettre en place des mesures durables, à l’issue d’une étude en cours sur l’alimentation scolaire.\nL’événement a eu lieu dans la cour de la DRENA 4, située à[ Abobo](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+Abobo) Centre, en présence d'inspecteurs, de conseillers, de directeurs d’écoles et de responsables de Coges (Comités de gestion des écoles). Alioune Bakayoko, au nom de la maire d’Abobo, a remis 20 sacs de riz de 25 kg chacun, destinés à soutenir les[ cantines](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+cantines)[ scolaires](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+scolaires) locales.\nCette initiative intervient dans un contexte où les autorités municipales cherchent à améliorer l'alimentation des[ élèves](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+%C3%A9l%C3%A8ves), afin de garantir une éducation de qualité. Selon Alioune Bakayoko, cette aide alimentaire n’est qu’un premier pas.\n« L’objectif est de mettre en place une stratégie durable qui soutienne véritablement les[ cantines](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+cantines)[ scolaires](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+scolaires) », a-t-il souligné, tout en rappelant que l’État seul ne pouvait assumer l’intégralité des besoins en matière d’alimentation scolaire.\nIl a également insisté sur la nécessité d’accompagner la politique du gouvernement, notamment la vision du Président Alassane Ouattara.\nLe Directeur régional de l’Éducation d’Abidjan 4, Prosper-Eloi Kobenan, a exprimé sa gratitude envers la maire d’Abobo et son équipe pour ce geste significatif. Il a souligné l’importance des[ cantines](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+cantines)[ scolaires](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+scolaires) pour la réussite des[ élèves](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+%C3%A9l%C3%A8ves), citant les résultats d’une étude selon laquelle une[ alimentation](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+alimentation) adéquate améliore les performances[ scolaires](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+scolaires) des enfants.\nToutefois, il a évoqué les difficultés rencontrées par l'État pour ouvrir des[ cantines](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+cantines) dans les 269 écoles publiques de la région, en raison des contraintes budgétaires et conjoncturelles actuelles.\nM. Kobenan a conclu en affirmant que cette aide alimentaire permettra aux[ élèves](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+%C3%A9l%C3%A8ves) d’Abobo de mieux se nourrir, avec l’espoir que cette action soit un premier pas vers une amélioration substantielle de l’offre alimentaire scolaire dans la commune. Il a enfin salué la vision et l'engagement de la maire d’Abobo pour le bien-être des[ élèves](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+%C3%A9l%C3%A8ves) et la réussite scolaire de la jeunesse de la commune.\nCette initiative montre l’engagement constant des autorités municipales d’Abobo dans la mise en place de solutions concrètes pour améliorer les conditions d’apprentissage des[ élèves](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+%C3%A9l%C3%A8ves), et ce, en partenariat avec les institutions éducatives et les autorités locales.\nWassimagnon\n[Aide](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=Aide)\n[ alimentation](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+alimentation)\n[ élèves](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+%C3%A9l%C3%A8ves)\n[ Kandia Camara soutient](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+Kandia+Camara+soutient)\n[ cantines](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+cantines)\n[ scolaires](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+scolaires)\n[ Abobo](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+Abobo)\n[ apprentissage](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+apprentissage)\n[ Kandia Camara](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/recherche?search=+Kandia+Camara)\nInfos à la une\n[\nPolitique\nCôte d'Ivoire: Libération des deux gendarmes ivoiriens arrêtés au Burkina,...\n](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/05/cote-divoire/politique/cote-divoire-liberation-des-deux-gendarmes-ivoiriens-arretes-au-burkina-ouattara-reconnaissant-a-faure-gnassingbe-pour-son-engagement-personnel-dans-cette-issue-heureuse_182873.html)\n[\nSociété\nCôte d'Ivoire : Terminal à Pêche, un docker meurt asphyxié suite à une fuit...\n](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/05/cote-divoire/societe/cote-divoire-terminal-a-peche-un-docker-meurt-asphyxie-suite-a-une-fuite-dammoniac-dans-un-navire-contenant-300-tonnes-de-thon-des-inquietudes-sur-la-qualite-des-poissons-soulevees_182869.html)\n[\nPolitique\nCôte d'Ivoire : Coopération internationale, Ouattara ouvre 12 postes d'atta...\n](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/05/cote-divoire/politique/cote-divoire-cooperation-internationale-ouattara-ouvre-12-postes-dattaches-de-securite-interieure-aupres-des-missions-diplomatiques-de-plusieurs-pays-dont-le-burkina-faso-et-le-mali_182879.html)\n[\nSociété\nCôte d'Ivoire : Financement des logements sociaux, Robert Beugré Mambé rent...\n](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/05/cote-divoire/societe/cote-divoire-financement-des-logements-sociaux-robert-beugre-mambe-rentre-des-emirats-arabes-unis-avec-une-enveloppe-de-31-milliards-fcfa_182885.html)\n[\nSanté\nCôte d'Ivoire : Fabrication de produits pharmaceutiques en Afrique, Abidjan...\n](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/05/cote-divoire/sante/cote-divoire-fabrication-de-produits-pharmaceutiques-en-afrique-abidjan-accueille-en-janvier-2025-une-rencontre-pour-arreter-une-liste-de-24-medicaments-prioritaires-pour-le-continent_182886.html)\n[\nSociété\nCôte d'Ivoire : Amélioration de l'alimentation des élèves, Kandia Camara of...\n](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/05/cote-divoire/societe/cote-divoire-amelioration-de-lalimentation-des-eleves-kandia-camara-offre-20-sacs-de-riz-de-25-kg-aux-cantines-scolaires-de-la-drena-4-dabobo-centre_182888.html)\nSONDAGE\n[\nDERNIER SONDAGE\nCôte d'Ivoire : PDCI, Billon un trouble-fête politique ?\n2245 ](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/sondages)\nOui 48%\n2272\nNon 49%\n143\nSans avis 3%\nOui\nNon\nSans avis\nCommuniqués\n[\n4 Décembre 2024\nSODECI ](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/04/cote-divoire/societe/cote-divoire-communique-de-la-sodeci-relatif-aux-travaux-de-maintenance-durgence-a-cocody_182830.html)\nCôte d'Ivoire\nCôte d'Ivoire : Communiqué de la Sodeci relatif aux travau...\nCôte d'Ivoire\n[\n2 Décembre 2024\nAMBASSADE USA CI ](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/02/cote-divoire/politique/visite-de-la-secretaire-detat-adjointe-par-interim-a-la-defense-mme-amanda-dory-au-benin-et-en-cote-divoire_182772.html)\nCôte d'Ivoire\nVisite de La Secrétaire d'État adjointe par intérim à la D...\nCôte d'Ivoire\n[\n2 Décembre 2024\nHuawei ](https://www.koaci.com/index.php/article/2024/12/02/cote-divoire/technologie/cote-divoire-huawei-a-la-pointe-de-linnovation-au-sirexe-2024_182770.html)\nCôte d'Ivoire\nCôte d'Ivoire : Huawei à la pointe de l'innovation au SIRE...\nCôte d'Ivoire",

    "title": "CES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech - ZDNet",
    "text": "CES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech After 2023 gave us the most innovative year in tech in over a decade, [the two trends that powered much of that innovation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-breakthroughs-made-2023-techs-most-innovative-year-in-over-a-decade/) -- AI and VR/AR -- are poised to lead the way at CES 2024. And following a fall product launch season that was as intense as any we've ever seen in the tech ecosystem, CES 2024 is set to explode with a ton of announcements about real products that are coming in the months ahead. In other words, you can expect to see a lot fewer of the CES experiments and flights-of-fancy of the past dominating the headlines this year, because there are so many interesting and useful new things to crowd them out. Special Feature ZDNET has already been pre-briefed on many of the best products that are coming, and we're looking forward to sharing our first impressions, original photos and videos, and buying advice. Our team will be on the ground at CES as well as covering it broadly from multiple time zones. We'll highlight the products we're most excited about, the trends that are taking shape from the show, and the latest innovations most likely to shape the future. To put it all in context, here are the three themes that will make the biggest impact at this year's CES. 1. AI clouds everything Any product that includes an algorithm, machine learning, or automation of any kind is going to be marketed as an AI-powered product at CES 2024. Make no mistake, there will be plenty of [AI-washing,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/generative-ai-is-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/) as companies vie with each other to ride the [generative AI wave](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/). ZDNET will help you cut through the AI marketing cacophony to learn the best AI innovations coming to products in 2024. Fortunately, there are a ton of potential benefits to look forward to -- from products and features that will automatically translate audio and text from different languages to TV hardware that will improve upscaling of low-res content for today's amazing 4K and 8K displays to truly time-saving automations in the products you use every day. 2. VR, AR, and XR prep for a big year The metaverse may have been dud, but mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) are surging on a new wave of interest -- thanks in large part to Apple's Vision Pro announcement, which has put the spotlight on the next generation of immersive digital experiences. You can get an excellent taste of these today in the [Meta Quest 3, ZDNET's 2023 product of the year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/zdnet-2023-product-of-the-year-meta-quest-3/). And CES 2024 will feature new hardware and experiences that will push it to the next level. We're expecting announcements about headsets that will use [Qualcomm's new XR2+ Gen2 VR chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/look-out-apple-qualcomms-new-vr-chip-competes-directly-with-vision-pro-with-much-cheaper-headsets/), new sensors and software that will extend what today's headsets and experiences can do, and the latest updates on how all kinds of organizations -- from health care to astronauts to law enforcement to architects to product designers -- are now relying on VR and XR to do critical parts of their work every day. Of course, all of this is a prelude to the launch of the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-apple-vision-pro-and-its-far-ahead-of-where-i-expected/), the arrival of the [Samsung/Google XR headset](https://www.zdnet.com/article/vision-pro-led-samsung-to-reboot-its-vr-headset-plans-and-its-now-targeting-end-of-2024-report/), and a tidal wave of new experiences from developers who will take advantage of these immersive digital platforms. 3. 100-inch TVs lead a wave of innovation TVs are back at the center of innovation at this year's show -- and leaps forward in display technology are making an even bigger and broader impact across the tech industry. From OLED to Mini-LED to Laser TV (projectors), there's a new explosion of innovation and competition that's making content more exciting than ever to consume. Nothing says CES like 100-inch TVs, and we're going to see a lot of them at CES 2024. A new generation of 100-inch TVs is coming to market that won't break the bank or your back. We can't wait to show you the latest TVs and home entertainment products that are coming and we'll offer analysis and buying advice on which ones could transform and level up the way you experience content in 2024. Stay tuned to ZDNET to cut through the fluff and find the stuff that's worth your attention at CES 2024. [Editorial standards](/editorial-guidelines/)",
