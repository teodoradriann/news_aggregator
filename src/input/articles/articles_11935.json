    "text": "ESPN’s recent profile of Joel Embiid discusses the former MVP’s struggles with injuries, mistrust and adapting to the NBA. But while the piece is sympathetic, it also details the way Embiid hasn’t helped his own cause. There’s no doubting Embiid’s willingness to play through injuries. In 2024, Embiid aggravated a knee injury in the first round of the playoffs, then suffered a bout of facial paralysis. Still, he played and averaged 33 points, 10.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists in the series loss. He also clearly works hard, building himself into an NBA MVP after growing up in Cameroon and not playing basketball seriously before age 16. Embiid moved to a new country, learning a new sport and a new language, while dealing with a misdiagnosed foot injury that cost him his first two seasons. But while Embiid’s journey is impressive, he acknowledges the ways he hasn’t helped himself. Like, by showing up late habitually.

    "text": "FIRST ALERT 6 WEATHER DAY: Slick mess of freezing drizzle could impact Friday PM commute\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - The past couple of days have been very cold and we are heading into another cold start on Friday! Lows reach the teens and single digits out the door... this means the ground will be very cold ahead of our next system bringing ice potential Friday PM.\nWe’ve made Friday a FIRST ALERT 6 WEATHER DAY due to the increasing potential for winter precipitation that could drastically impact the road conditions Friday afternoon and evening.\nWe’ll start the day with cloudy skies but will remain dry into the early afternoon. This means no issues are expected for the morning drive and likely for the afternoon pick up from school.\nBetween 3-4PM Friday a round of freezing drizzle will try to develop and move in from the southwest. The earliest freezing drizzle will move in after 4pm and could produce a light coating of ice in places for the evening drive.\nThankfully the drizzle looks spotty so hopefully the ice potential won’t be widespread to start. After 7PM it will be very widespread. The roads will likely be at their worst from 7PM-12AM.\nAt the moment icing amounts look to be less than 0.1″ for most of the area.\nThere is more cold drizzle that is likely later Friday night as temperatures actually WARM a bit more overnight with a surge of subtle warmth along with a southeast breeze. This will change us to all rain and start to erode the icy conditions... this likely does not happen until after midnight for the Metro, but sooner for locations to the S.\nThe snow potential is trending farther north of our area at this point too. This looks to be mostly a freezing rain/sleet to rain event for most of our area. Areas to the N are last to change from freezing rain to rain and this may still be ongoing near Norfolk, Tekamah and Dennison well into Saturday AM.\nWe will warm up through the weekend with rain ending Saturday afternoon and sunshine with highs in the 40s on Sunday.\nCopyright 2024 WOWT.
