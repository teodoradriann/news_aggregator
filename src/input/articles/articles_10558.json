    "title": "These are the pro-Iranian militias attacking US bases and sending drones to Eilat",
    "text": "A Lebanese journalist reported Thursday that the \"Islamic Resistance in Iraq,\" a group composed of pro-Iranian militias operating in Iraq and Syria, attacked the Pik airfield south of Moshav Eliad in the Golan Heights which the Elbit security company uses to test UAVs and air defense systems. Read more: These pro-Iranian militias have also been responsible for attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria in recent months. Recently, they even launched a drone toward Eilat, and took credit for it. In Iraq and Syria, there has been a noticeable escalation in attacks against American forces since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. According to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq is, in fact, a relatively new union of several well-established militias supported by Iran: Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya, and Imam Ali. These armed groups chose to unite and call themselves the \"Islamic Resistance in Iraq\" last October. A senior Pentagon official confirmed to the Al-Miyadin network on Wednesday that \"American forces and coalition forces were exposed to 106 attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria since October 17.\" Also on Wednesday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for the drone attack on the American military base in Erbil. The group said that in addition to firing toward the Golan Heights, they also attacked a site in Erbil associated with Israel. The fact that the recent claims of responsibility are attributed to the umbrella organization and not to a specific militia serves the interests of these militias. In recent months, reports have emerged of differences among the organizations regarding fighting against the U.S. in Iraq and Syria. Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that during most of the cease-fire in the Gaza war, most factions supported ending attacks on Americans since the fighting was conducted \"in support of the Gaza front.\" Other factions refused to stop attacks. When the Gaza fighting resumed, so did the attacks on American bases in Syria and Iraq. On Tuesday, sources close to Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq reported that the terror group is preparing for a new round of escalation against American bases. According to the report, the escalation \"will include missile attacks and drone strikes in response to American attacks and retaliation for [the assassination of IRGC official Sayyed Reza Mousavi in Damascus by Israel.](https://www.ynetnews.com/Iran reports senior IRGC officer killed in Israeli airstrike in Syria)\" One source told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that discussions between the militias and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi have reached a standstill and have been suspended. According to the same source, the Iraqi prime minister \"wants to cease attacks on American bases without any reciprocal commitments, without the departure of the Americans, without reviewing the security agreement with them, and without stopping the attacks in Gaza – essentially an unconditional victory.\" Iraq's Kadhimi has been actively working in recent months, both against the militias and Iran, to try to stop the attacks on American bases. His attempts have so far been unsuccessful. \"The government is moving toward the end of the international coalition's presence in Iraq,\" according to the prime minister. \"The Iraqi government is capable of committing to protecting diplomatic missions. The war in the Gaza Strip has exposed the failure of the international system to achieve security and stability.\"",

    "text": "[CoronaVirus](../) Small businesses now helping to drive New York City’s post-pandemic recovery NEW YORK (WABC) — Retailers are expected to break new spending records again this year amid the holiday shopping season. Many shoppers go online or to big box stores, but what about a group of retailers that have been struggling the most over the past few years? 7 On Your Side Investigates has been tracking some good news for small businesses. They were hit the hardest during the pandemic when more than 30,000 in New York City shut down, but they are now driving the city’s recovery. When we first met the owner of Exit 9 Gift Emporium back in December of 2020, it was Charles Branstool’s worst sales year ever and he didn’t think his business was going to make it. But today, he says business is thriving. “Well, things are definitely a lot better, the demand has returned, so that’s good,” Branstool said. “The supply chains are getting stronger than they were back then, so things have definitely returned to normal.” And he’s not alone. “The retailers have said the foot traffic has been excellent, they had a great Thanksgiving season and look forward to a good Christmas season so that’s very positive,” said Kathryn Wylde with Partnership for NYC. Business owners say something is helping — the amount of empty storefronts has decreased this year, compared to years past, which has helped with foot traffic. “Luckily, some of the vacant spaces that we’ve seen near me have new businesses in them and I do think that creates a more attractive neighborhood for people to come into and spend money,” Branstool said. During the pandemic, the number of vacant storefronts peaked at more than 8,500 — that number has gone down by 27% over the past year. “So in less than two years, we’ve seen 38,600 new businesses formed in New York City, most of them are retail, restaurant, and small business,” Wylde said. Dozens of those new businesses started in Times Square alone — an area that became a ghost town during the pandemic. But a recent report shows the areas with the most growth have been northern Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The number of small businesses citywide is back to 96% of pre-pandemic levels. “We are stronger than we were in terms of small business activity,” Wylde said. It’s something they hope will continue in the new year.

    "text": "Background: News footage of the Broomfield, Colo. home where Kristil Krug was found dead on Dec. 14, 2023 (KUSA). Inset (top): Daniel Krug (Broomfield Police Department). Inset (bottom): Kristil Krug (Horan & McConaty Funeral Service and Cremation).\nA Colorado man accused of allegedly murdering his wife after posing as a stalking ex-boyfriend could soon learn his fate.\nDaniel Krug, 44, was in the courtroom in front of a judge and jury as prosecutors laid out evidence that they believed pointed in his direction as the alleged killer of his late wife, Kristil Krug, 43. Prosecutors presented a digital data trail that they say led to Krug after he allegedly posed as his wife’s ex-boyfriend in text messages that left her in fear that she was being stalked. Following months of texts, Kristil Krug was found in the garage of her home on Dec. 14, 2023, beaten and stabbed to death.\nRelated Coverage: Senior Deputy District Attorney Kate Armstrong painted a picture of a marriage in trouble, according to KUSA, a local NBC affiliate in the courtroom for proceedings. Armstrong reportedly told jurors that the Krugs’ marriage was “all but over,” and as the chilling texts kept Kristil Krug in fear, she reportedly suspected that her husband was the one behind them.\n“She was putting the pieces together, and he was running out of time,” Armstrong told the jury.\nInvestigators said that Kristil Krug and the ex-boyfriend who supposedly sent her the texts had not dated since 2000. Aside from occasional messages from him over the years that would be considered crude, Kristil Krug had reportedly not expressed much concern over them.\nKristil Krug’s mother also reportedly told authorities that her daughter was planning to divorce her husband, accusing him of being “sometimes rough with the kids.”\nThe texts Kristil Krug was receiving in 2023, supposedly from her ex-boyfriend, were enough for her to file a police report on Oct. 31, 2023. According to court documents, the texts indicated to Kristil Krug that the sender knew where she and her husband worked, and that both were being watched.\nEventually, police suspected that it was Daniel Krug who was sending the texts after investigators connected the IP address from the messages to his workplace. He also allegedly used a burner phone that he bought with a gift card registered to his name.\nDetectives also said that security cameras at the home had tape over the lenses and a Ring camera had been turned off. When questioned about the cameras not working, Daniel Krug allegedly could not provide an explanation.\nDaniel Krug’s defense attorney, Joe Morales, attempted to paint the whole investigation as flawed. Detectives assigned to Kristil Krug’s October 2023 filing were incompetent, he argued. Prosecutors said that Daniel Krug allegedly used his wife’s phone to send texts after her death — Morales said no one tested her phone for fingerprints. DNA found on the tape that covered the camera in the garage was from an unknown source.\nBut Armstrong told the court that Daniel Krug still tried to blame the ex-boyfriend for his wife’s slaying — even though he was in Utah at the time. Armstrong said that when Daniel Krug was questioned by detectives and confronted with the ex-boyfriend’s alibi, he accused his late wife of having more affairs. She quoted Daniel Krug himself, who reportedly then rolled his eyes and said, “It’s always the husband.”\nDaniel Krug’s trial is expected to continue through April 18.\nLove true crime?

    "title": "New York appeals court overturns Harvey Weinstein’s sex crimes conviction and orders a new trial",
    "text": "WCBS, CNN By Eric Levenson, CNN (CNN) — The New York Court of Appeals on Thursday overturned the sex crimes conviction against Harvey Weinstein , the powerful Hollywood producer whose downfall stood as a symbol of the #MeToo movement, and ordered a new trial. The court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled the testimony of “prior bad acts” witnesses should not have been allowed because it “was unnecessary to establish defendant’s intent and served only to establish defendant’s propensity to commit the crimes charged.” Weinstein, 72, was convicted in 2020 of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and he was sentenced to 23 years in prison . He has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said it plans to retry the case. “We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,” said Emily Tuttle, deputy director of communications and senior advisor for the office. Weinstein is being held at Mohawk Correctional Facility in Rome, New York, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. The department said it is reviewing the appeals court’s decision. Weinstein will soon be taken from the correctional facility to Manhattan court and his trial will start anew, with a new judge and prosecutor, defense attorney Arthur Aidala said in a news conference. He is unlikely to be released because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to 16 years in prison for charges of rape and sexual assault. That trial similarly used “prior bad acts” witnesses and has also been appealed. Thursday’s ruling comes more than six years after reporting by The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017 revealed Weinstein’s alleged history of sexual abuse, harassment and secret settlements as he used his influence as a Hollywood power broker to take advantage of young women. At the time, Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and helped produce movies such as “Pulp Fiction,” “Clerks” and “Shakespeare in Love.” The revelations led to a wave of women speaking publicly about the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and harassment in what became known as the #MeToo movement. Yet, #MeToo has had mixed success in the courtroom, and this is the second high-profile case to be overturned on appeal. The comedian Bill Cosby was convicted in 2018 of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, but a Pennsylvania appeals court overturned the conviction in 2021, saying his due process rights were violated. Weinstein is ‘very grateful,’ attorney says The ruling overturning Weinstein’s conviction led to a range of reactions from those involved with the case. Upon hearing the news, Weinstein “heaped praise” on his legal team and was “very gracious” and “very grateful,” Aidala said. “The witnesses were there just to make Harvey Weinstein look bad,” Aidala said. “That’s the only reason why those witnesses were admitted. To show that he’s a bad guy. He was tried on his character, not the evidence.” “Justice was served,” said Donna Rotunno, the lead defense attorney at Weinstein’s trial in New York. “I believe this decision is larger than Harvey Weinstein. Courts cannot operate on emotion and lack of due process. The world is off-balance, and when the justice system does not work, nothing does. This decision restores faith in the foundation of our system.” “We are cautiously excited and need to study the ramifications of the appeal decision,” Weinstein’s spokesperson Juda Engelmayer said. “We always said this was an unjust trial.” Former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who brought the charges against Weinstein, said he was “shocked” by the decision. “I am deeply grateful to and humbled by the survivors who came forward in the brightest glare of a public courtroom to tell their stories at great personal cost and trauma,” Vance said in a statement. “The judicial system, in my opinion, has let them down today and did not advance justice. “ Dawn Dunning, one of the “prior bad acts” witnesses in Weinstein’s trial, said in a statement she did not regret testifying and urged the district attorney’s office to retry the case. “While I’m stunned that the court threw out Weinstein’s conviction on legal technicalities, I am still proud that I testified and confronted that convicted rapist,” she said. “I came forward to support other women who were also sexually abused by Weinstein and to ensure that he would be held accountable.” Miriam “Mimi” Haley, whose testimony made up the first-degree criminal sexual act charge, “would consider testifying again” in a potential retrial, her attorney Gloria Allred said in a statement. “Even though the process of testifying was grueling and retraumatizing for Mimi, she reaffirmed to me today that she would consider testifying again if (Manhattan) District Attorney Alvin Bragg decided to proceed with a new trial of Harvey Weinstein,” she said. “I commend Mimi on her courage and willingness to keep standing up for the truth.” Douglas H. Wigdor, an attorney who has represented eight of Weinstein’s accusers, including two of the “prior bad acts” witnesses at his New York criminal trial, also criticized the decision. “Today’s decision is a major step back in holding those accountable for acts of sexual violence,” he said in a statement. “Courts routinely admit evidence of other uncharged acts where they assist juries in understanding issues concerning the intent, modus operandi or scheme of the defendant. The jury was instructed on the relevance of this testimony and overturning the verdict is tragic in that it will require the victims to endure yet another trial.” What happened at his NY trial The New York charges were directly based on the testimony of Haley and Jessica Mann . Haley testified that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment, and Mann testified that he raped her in 2013 during what she described as an abusive relationship. In addition, three other women testified during the trial as “ prior bad acts ” witnesses as prosecutors sought to show Weinstein had a pattern of abuse. These women – Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young – each said Weinstein used his Hollywood influence to take advantage of them when they were young and hoping to break into the film industry. After Weinstein was convicted in his New York trial, his attorneys appealed the verdict . They argued the judge should not have allowed these “prior bad acts” witnesses to testify and should not have given prosecutors the ability to question Weinstein about instances of verbal abuse and bullying on cross-examination. (Weinstein ultimately did not testify in the case.) The Court of Appeals agreed with the defense on those points. “We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose,” the ruling, written by Judge Jenny Rivera, states. “The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light. The synergistic effect of these errors was not harmless.” Yet in a stinging dissent, Judge Madeline Singas wrote that the majority opinion “perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence and allows predators to escape accountability.” “This conclusion deprives juries of the context necessary to do their work, forecloses the prosecution from using an essential tool to prove intent, ignores the nuances of how sexual violence is perpetrated and perceived, and demonstrates the majority’s utter lack of understanding of the dynamics of sexual assault,” Singas wrote. “Because New York’s women deserve better, I dissent.” The use of “prior bad acts” witnesses has increased in recent years with the rise of the #MeToo movement. In sexual assault cases, their testimony can turn a difficult “he said, she said” case into a more convincing “he said, they said” case. In general, evidence that the defendant has poor character or has done bad things in the past is not allowed during a trial. The fear is that the jury will be overly influenced by these prior incidents and may ignore the actual evidence of the alleged crime. “Prior bad acts” evidence is one exception to this rule. It can be used to prove the defendant’s “motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident,” according to federal evidence rules . Judges have a fair amount of discretion to decide what is and what isn’t allowed in court as they try to balance the relevance of the testimony against the prejudice to the jury.
