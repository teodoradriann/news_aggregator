    "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Thursday rallied for a fighting 3-1 win over Asian champions Qatar in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium. Qatar opened the scoring through Ibrahim al-Hasan in the 38th minute in what was the 18-year-old’s first international goal for the home team. Harib Abdalla Suhail (68th minute), Khaled Ebraheim (80) and Ali Saleh (90+4) sealed UAE’s first over Qatar since Jan 2015. It was UAE’s first win on Qatar soil since 2001. It was Qatar’s first loss under new coach Marquez Lopez in over nine months. For rival coach Paulo Bento, it was a welcome relief for UAE who exited the AFC Asian Cup at the Round of 16 stage earlier this year in Qatar. “It was a difficult for us. We started well in the first half. We were the better side and succeeded in scoring the lead goal but missed some other opportunities,” Qatar defender Tareq Salman said. “In the second half, there were some individual mistakes that the UAE national team exploited to score three goals. The players feel we must work hard on correcting the mistakes in the future. We want to tell our fans that we will rectify our mistakes in the upcoming matches. We will work hard since the journey is still long in the qualifiers,” he added. While the first half belonged to Qatar, Bento’s spirited UAE side responded with three goals in the second. A bicycle kick in the second minute by Qatar forward Jassem Gaber inside the UAE box was wayward but the intent was obvious from the home side. Defender Lucas Mendes headed away on a loopy cross from Kouame Autonne following a deep lob from the flank by Yahya al-Ghassani with a cross in the 12th minute. The game got held up twice in quick succession when al-Ghassani (17h minute) and Yahia Nader (18th minute) called for medical help. In the 25th minute, UAE’s Autonne got booked with a yellow card for a reckless foul. Close to the half hour mark, Gaber headed from very close range but the ball flew high following an assist by striker Akram Afif with a cross following a corner. In the 35th minute, Al Duhail captain Almoez Ali launched a right-footed shot from the right side of the box but it was blocked following an assist by Ismail Mohamed. Three minutes later, Qatar opened the scoring thanks largely to Afif’s deft pass that found young al-Hassan close by. The 18-year-old slipped in a right-footed shot from the centre of the UAE box to the bottom right corner for the home team’s only goal. Six minutes into the second half, Afif drilled a right-footed shot from outside the box but the ball flew high and wide of the UAE goalmouth following a corner kick. Close to the hour-mark, Afif found Almoez with a loopy header near the UAE box but UAE’s Ivorian-born defender Autonne was alive to the situation to thwart the Al Duhail forward. UAE’s Abdullah Hamad in a desperate attempt for an equaliser launched a long-range shot but was found wanting on the angle. Moments later, UAE’s Tahnoon al-Zaabi drilled a curling left-footed drive from outside the Qatar box. Al-Zaabi’s shot hit the outside of the net with keeper Meshaal Barsham beaten by the flight of the ball in the 63rd minute. With momentum on their side, UAE produced a classy equaliser from inside the Qatar box. Suhail delivered a beautiful curling left-footed shot from about 10 yards out to bring things level at 1-1 at a packed Ahmed Bin Ali Stadium. The ball flew past the outstretched hand of keeper Barsham before thudding into the net. UAE continued to apply pressure with an attacking game in the last 20 minutes of the match resulting in two quick goals. In a fast break in the 80th minute, Ebraheim – after an assist from Suhail – drilled a left-footed shot from outside the box to the top right corner of Qatar goal. Substitute MacKenzie Hunt – after replacing al-Zaabi in the 89th minute – made an immediate impact. Four minutes into injury time, Hunt found Saleh with a through ball. Quick-footed Saleh had the time and space to drill a left-footed shot to the top left corner of the Qatar goalmouth. A few minutes earlier, Qatar had a penalty denied following a long VAR decision in the 86th minute. Qatar now fly to Laos to take on North Korea on September 10. Asian giants Iran, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are the other teams in Group A.

    "text": "Evangelio del díacomentado por Clara González Evangelio del día: «Proclama mi alma la grandeza del Señor» Hoy, 31 de mayo, nos acercamos al Evangelio de san Lucas, comentado por Alex Navajas Actualizada 04:30 Lucas 1, 39-56 Se llenó Isabel del Espíritu Santo y dijo a voz en grito: «¡Bendita tú entre las mujeres, y bendito el fruto de tu vientre! ¿Quién soy yo para que me visite la madre de mi Señor? En cuanto tu saludo llegó a mis oídos, la criatura saltó de alegría en mi vientre. Dichosa tú, que has creído, porque lo que te ha dicho el Señor se cumplirá». María dijo: «Proclama mi alma la grandeza del Señor, se alegra mi espíritu en Dios, mi salvador; porque ha mirado la humillación de su esclava. Desde ahora me felicitarán todas las generaciones, porque el Poderoso ha hecho obras grandes por mí: su nombre es santo, y su misericordia llega a sus fieles de generación en generación. Él hace proezas con su brazo: dispersa a los soberbios de corazón, derriba del trono a los poderosos y enaltece a los humildes, a los hambrientos los colma de bienes y a los ricos los despide vacíos. Auxilia a Israel, su siervo, acordándose de la misericordia, como lo había prometido a nuestros padres en favor de Abrahán y su descendencia por siempre». María se quedó con Isabel unos tres meses y después volvió a su casa.

    "text": "Secciones Servicios Destacamos León Jueves, 25 de abril 2024, 20:13 Necesitas ser registrado para acceder a esta funcionalidad. Compartir Un varón menor de edad ha resultado herido en la tarde de este jueves a causa de una puñalada en la ciudad de León y ha tenido que ser trasladado al Hospital de León en un incidente que se ha saldado con dos detenidos, también menores de edad. Los hechos han tenido lugar en la tarde de este jueves, en torno a las 19:50 horas en el entorno del parque de Quevedo, concretamente en el número 11 de la avenida Doctor Fleming de la capital. Fueron los propios viandantes quienes dieron la voz de aviso y alertaron al 112 del incidente, en el que un menor, de nacionalidad dominicana, sufría una herida por arma blanca en el costado. El Servicio de Emergencias del 112 de Castilla y León ha derivado la llamada a Policía Local, Policía Nacional y Servicios Sanitarios, que enviaron una UVI Móvil. Según ha podido saber este medio de comunicación, esta agresión se debe a un «ajuste de cuentas» por el que este menor fue apuñalado por otro menor de edad de nacionalidad española. El amplio despliegue policial desplegado en el lugar de los hechos permitió que los agentes de la Policía Nacional de León detuviesen a dos menores, uno de ellos como presunto autor material de la agresión. El menor herido ha tenido que ser trasladado al Hospital de León en UVI Móvil.

    "title": "Why is Gov. DeSantis so hostile to the arts?",
    "text": "Some people are ignorant and proud of it. Ron DeSantis is one of those people.\nThe man recently vetoed almost every pitiful penny of arts and culture funding in the state budget. Museums, music, youth programs, treasures such as Tallahassee’s Young Actor’s Theater — which trained stars like Alison Miller of “King,” Cheryl Hines of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and Tony Hale of “Veep” — historic houses, Black heritage centers, performing arts spaces, dance companies, kids’ music programs, even renowned institutions such as the Ringling Museum of Art, one of the few places in Florida where visitors can see works by Old Masters such as Veronese, Rubens and Poussin.\nDiane Roberts With his characteristic eloquence, DeSantis snarled, “Some of the stuff I don’t think was appropriate for state tax dollars.” (The man has few friends, and words are not among them).\nThis latest show of temper is probably because art and culture are “stuff” he thinks liberals like, “stuff” he’s incapable of comprehending. Ergo, bad “stuff.”\nThe Legislature’s 2024 budget was worth $117.5 billion and included money for the arts. But DeSantis, determined to demonstrate what a fiscal badass he is, nixed a billion bucks that would have aided programs for the homeless, opioid use prevention, free sanitary products for Florida schools and food banks, as well as runoff and sewage treatment.\nYou’d think after the pollution disasters of Piney Point, a shed-load of excrement discharged into Tampa Bay and the recent fierce flooding in Broward County, he’d take our water issues seriously.\nSo-called Pregnancy Crisis Centers , pro-birth proselytizing outfits set up to bully young women into having babies they can’t take care of and don’t want, got $25 million in public cash.\nWhat literate folks think of culture, however, got the veto machete: $32 million cut.\n$1 : $9 That’s a lot of money to you or me but, spread around the third largest state in the union, it’s what professional economists call minuscule, desultory, sofa change.\nA few things survived DeSantis’ attack on mind enrichment: $5 million for a Holocaust museum in Orlando, $750,000 for preserving oral histories of Holocaust survivors, $250,000 for the Civil Rights Museum in St. Augustine. Fine, but insultingly meager. Economically stupid , too. The state’s own data show the arts bring in $5.8 billion a year.\nTheaters, museums, orchestras and the like provide jobs and pump money into the community: One dollar spent on the arts generates $9 for local businesses.\nSpend your days with Hayes Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter\nColumnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday. Loading...\nYou’re all signed up! Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let’s get started.\nExplore all your options\nDeSantis doesn’t care. He’s driven by spite, pique and a MAGA-ty determination to destroy. Have you ever heard the man talk about music he likes or books he enjoys or any kind of aesthetic experience at all?\nEvery summer former President Barack Obama puts out lists of books and songs he loves, evidence of an active, elastic intelligence taking in everything from serious sociology (Matthew Desmond’s “Poverty, by America”) to thrillers by Dennis Lehane to Bad Bunny’s baddest reggaeton.\nIt’s impossible to imagine Ron DeSantis doing anything like this. He seems to have no inner life, no curiosity, no desire to learn, no passion for anything other than power. And maybe baseball.\nRonbo and Lady Macbeth flew to Omaha on a state-owned corporate jet to watch some of the College World Series. You, Florida taxpayer, footed that bill.\nHall of Fame No governor in Florida history has chosen to wreck one of our most important industries. No other governor has been so aggressive in tearing down what’s taken generations to build up. Florida used to be better.\nIn 1976, the Legislature commissioned James Rosenquist, one of the nation’s most important artists, to create witty murals for the new Capitol building. (Don’t tell DeSantis: He’ll probably want to whitewash them).\nTen years later, the Legislature established the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, honoring the likes of playwright Tennessee Williams, master funkster George Clinton, Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and filmmaker Victor Nuñez, among others. Gov. Bob Graham loved meeting novelists like Carl Hiaasen and Bob Shacochis and hanging out with Jimmy Buffet .\nEven during the late, unlamented administration of Rick Scott, the Governor’s Mansion hosted the Florida Book Awards ceremony. Ann Scott, like many first ladies before her, promoted reading as a positive good.\nThe current holder of that title shows no interest in culture.\nSinister project DeSantis’ attack on arts funding is part of a larger, more sinister project to erase anything that might inspire us to question our assumptions, interrogate our history, critique our society or imagine what it’s like to be someone whose race or ethnicity or religion or sexuality is different from ours.\nLook at what he’s doing to our schools, unleashing on them the chowder-headed Moms for Liberty to push banning any book not in service of white supremacy.\nLook what he’s doing to our universities: The once highly regarded New College is now a smoking ruin , transformed by DeSantis into a third-rate Bible college stocked with scholarship baseball players and losing faculty fast.\nThe University of Florida College of Medicine was not only forced to hire Joseph Ladapo, Florida’s vaccine-hating quack of a surgeon general, but to give him tenure and pay him six figures, even though he never teaches any classes.\nNow lawyers for the state (you’re paying for those, too) are trying to convince the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to lift the block on DeSantis’ Individual Freedom Act, also known as the Stop Woke Act, arguing (with a straight face, even) that it would be fine for DeSantis’ Education Enforcers to hand professors a script to read from in class on the grounds they must teach only “viewpoints” approved by the state: “ The professor’s speech is the government’s speech .”\nViktor Orbán couldn’t put it better himself.\nFear The irredeemably petty DeSantis is scared — scared of scholars, artists and educators. When authoritarians get scared, they lash out — in this case, the effect is a bit like a cornered and angry Chihuahua. The situation should be merely comical, but the yippy little thing can bite the hell out of you and may have rabies.\nYou can’t keep your service industry serfs numb and inured to increasing insurance rates, rising waters, government secrecy and diminished freedom (in the name of “freedom”) if they get exposed to plays or pictures that tell a different story than the one on the government’s script.\nActually thinking about the world you live in pretty much guarantees dissent.\nDiane Roberts is an eighth-generation Floridian.
