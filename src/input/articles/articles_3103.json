    "text": "A backyard view of a pileated woodpecker, a black-capped chickadee or even a winter wren this weekend could be part of a worldwide bird count. [The Great Backyard Bird Count](https://www.birdcount.org/) returns for the 27th year, beginning Feb.16 through Feb.19. The global event gives people the opportunity to observe birds and submit their findings to a database. “A lot of people just don't realize how interesting and neat birds are,” said Becca Rodomsky-Bish, project leader for the great backyard bird count. “They don't realize sometimes the diversity of birds that may be around them and so this is an opportunity to sort of have that spark moment where you realize, ‘Wow, that there are birds and their species that I never even knew existed out there.’” People are asked to watch birds for at least 15 minutes, count and identify the type, then submit their observations to [eBird.](https://ebird.org/home) Related: Observers can use [Merlin](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/?utm_source=adgrant&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=merlin&utm_content=merlinbirdguide&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAw6yuBhDrARIsACf94RUlN2--EUv3h_f1vH2_3dSpvAHVZQLPO13sc542IeLSf_zQQY5QOT4aAnzwEALw_wcB) from The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a tool that makes it easier to identify bird species by either sound, photo or by answering three simple questions. This type of data from around the world allows a view into bird movements, including new locations for different species, which can paint a picture of a changing environment, Rodomsky-Bish said. Researchers are using the data to answer broader questions related to climate change, for example. Rodomsky-Bish said it is very likely the data from the event will show that changing weather patterns have influenced when and where birds migrate. Rodomsky-Bish said she is looking forward to data that shows birds may be moving earlier and farther north than in previous years due to the warm weather this winter. The Department of Natural Resources encourages safe practices for attracting birds. “One of the things that we recommend is to make sure they keep their feeders clean and do it before you start to see sick birds,” said Julie Melotti of the DNR Wildlife Disease Lab. “Keep areas around bird feeders tidy and clean. If food gets scattered on the ground just pick it up,” she said. Diseases like Salmonellosis and various strains of bird influenza are easily transmitted through bird feeders, Melotti said. Highly pathogenic diseases can be spread to other birds like turkeys and chickens. “Birds are really important to protect because they provide a lot of ecosystem services and a lot of cultural services to people,” she said. “In addition to all that they give to agricultural and to natural environments, they’re also obviously something that people really enjoy looking at and being around.” No comments on this item [Please log in to comment by clicking here](/login.html?referer=%2Fstories%2Fmichigans-backyard-bird-enthusiasts-can-join-global-count-this-weekend%2C86662) [ Support City Pulse - Donate Today! ](https://lansingcitypulse.org/support-us/)",

    "title": "Remembering Pastor Phillip Loveday: Tragedy and Tribute in Corpus Christi",
    "text": "The story of Pastor Phillip Loveday is both heartbreaking and significant, touching on themes of community, faith, and the stark reality of mental health struggles. As the leader of Christal Valley Church in Robstown, Texas, Loveday was known for his dedication to serving others and his unwavering commitment to his faith. However, the events leading up to his tragic demise serve as a poignant reminder of the complexities hidden behind public personas.\nThe Disappearance of a Beloved Pastor\nOn April 12, 2022, Phillip Loveday went missing under mysterious circumstances. He was last seen driving his work truck from a funeral service in Corpus Christi, Texas, back to his home.\nThis sudden disappearance sent ripples of concern through the community he had served so passionately. Loveday was not just any individual; he was a beacon of hope and a pillar of support for many. His absence was immediately felt, and a frantic search ensued.\nThe Discovery\nSix days post-disappearance, the community’s worst fears were realized. Pastor Loveday’s body was discovered inside his truck on South Staples Street in Corpus Christi, marking a tragic end to the search. The cause of death was determined to be an apparent suicide, leaving his family, friends, and followers in profound grief and disbelief.\nRELATED:\nTexas Pastor Missing for Nearly a Week Found Dead From a Gunshot Wound\nFamily and Community Response\nPhillip Loveday was more than just a pastor; he was a loving and devoted husband, father, and a revered figure in the community. Known for his work with youth groups and the homeless, he embodied the spirit of selfless service.\nHis death left a void that was felt deeply by those who knew him and even those who only knew of his good deeds. The news of his passing was met with an outpouring of love and remembrance, highlighting the impact he had on the lives he touched.\nPersonal Struggles Behind the Pulpit\nIn the wake of his death, details emerged about Loveday’s personal challenges. Reports indicated that he had been grappling with depression and anxiety for years. Additionally, he was undergoing a tumultuous separation from his wife and facing significant financial difficulties. These revelations shed light on the intense private struggles that contrasted sharply with his public persona as a strong, unwavering leader.\nMental Health: A Crucial Dialogue\nPhillip Loveday’s story underscores the critical importance of mental health awareness and support. It is a stark reminder that anyone, regardless of their status or profession, can face mental health challenges. Loveday’s legacy, marred by tragedy, serves as a call to action for better mental health resources and open conversations about emotional well-being.\nSuicide Prevention and Support\nIn response to this tragedy, it is vital to highlight the importance of suicide prevention. Resources like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Dial 988 or 1-800-273-TALK [8255]) offer crucial support for those struggling with suicidal thoughts. Loveday’s story emphasizes the need for accessible mental health services and the importance of reaching out for help when needed.\nRELATED:\nNecessary Conversations: The Church, Suicide, and Mental Health",
