    "text": "Did you know there’s been a sharp decline in the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables?\nWe are not getting as many nutrients as we once were, and this is why\nmultivitamins are important. Soil depletion and GMO’s are just some of the factors that have led to foods being less nutrient dense than they once were, having serious effects on our bodybuilding and weightlifting goals. Now, more than ever, it’s difficult to obtain optimal amounts of micronutrients naturally from your diet and for us as bodybuilders and other strength athletes, this just doesn’t cut it. To be successful with our bodybuilding goals, we need nutrients, and vital ones at that. A good multivitamin can help us capitalize on all these gains, and keep our immune systems in check, so we don’t miss out on anything important.\nIn fact, up to 50% of the US population has shown to be deficient in micronutrient levels such as\nMagnesium [1] in clinical studies.\nLet’s break down what multivitamins are, the benefits that they bring, and the best multivitamin for bodybuilding.\nOverview of Multivitamins\nMultivitamins can provide optimal amounts of micronutrients needed to function at your best. While you should try to obtain all\nmicro and macro nutrients naturally from your diet, sometimes it can be difficult. Much like how consuming enough protein is possible through your diet, but bodybuilders still use protein powder to make their life much easier.\nThe Best Multivitamin for Bodybuilding\nPerformance Lab NutriGenesis Multi For Men is a specifically formulated multi for bodybuilders to help with all their needs. With 17+ essential daily vitamins and minerals, this top tier formula is great for overall health and wellness.\nPerformance Lab NutriGenesis Multi For Men is a top tier multivitamin with amazing ingredients and an effective formula to boost all areas of your health and wellness.\nPerformance Lab is a leader in nutritional supplements and with formulas that include industry-leading ingredients, their products combine nutritional technology with\nhigh-quality and innovative supplements to meet all of their consumers’ needs.

Their state-of-the-art facilities are current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) compliant and registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nHow We Choose\nSo how do you choose a natural multivitamin to buy? Well, it’s not as easy as picking up the first multivitamin that claims to be ‘natural’ you see on the shelf.\nMost multivitamins on the market are synthetic and not fully utilized by your body, resulting in your urine turning yellow after they are excreted. And you wasting your cash.\nThere are several things to consider that you’re probably not aware of. One important point being natural vitamins have proven to be naturally superior to synthetic vitamins in numerous studies [2].\nAs a result, it’s important that you do some research and find a natural multivitamin providing vitamins and minerals that can actually be used by your body. The good news is that we’ve done the hard work for you. One product, in particular, stood out among the crowd…\nPerformance Lab® NutriGenesis® Multi\nKey Benefits:\n- No excreting vitamins, no yellow urine – Patented ‘NutriGenesis®’ system provides natural-identical vitamins and minerals your body actually uses.\n- Fuel your body for performance – Specifically delivers the nutritional needs for men, so you can perform at your best.\n- Optimal dosages of vitamins and minerals – Contains over 17 essential daily vitamins + minerals with whole-food cofactors in scientifically-proven dosages.\nQuick Summary\nNutriGenesis® is a patented system by Performance Lab® that produces highly absorbable vitamins and minerals. These micronutrients are grown in a way that mirrors nutrient genesis in nature – so that your body recognizes these vitamins and minerals as actual ‘\nfood’ instead of as synthetic supplements.\nThat means Performance Lab® NutriGenesis® Multi doesn’t rely on dehydrating carrots or other vegetables that have suffered from serious nutritional decline, like other “whole-food multivitamins” do. It’s the highest quality multivitamin that we’ve seen on the market and could be essential for bodybuilders and gym-goers to help fill any nutritional gaps left in their diet. It has also made it to the top of our list for the\nbest multivitamins for men.\nPerformance Lab® also deliver everywhere in the world. So whether you’re wanting the best multivitamin for bodybuilding in the UK, US or anywhere else, you’ll have no issues with fast shipping.\nDo I Need a Multivitamin for Bodybuilding?\nIf there’s one supplement that all bodybuilders should be taking, it’s a multivitamin. Even if you weigh out all of your meals and plan everything, you might still have nutritional gaps in your diet. And if you don’t plan your meals at all, then forget about even trying to consume optimal micronutrient levels through your food. In a nutshell, multivitamins help fill those gaps and ensure that you have a strong nutritional foundation to build on.\nThe age old saying “you wouldn’t build a house without a strong foundation” really does apply here.\nVitamin D is Important for Muscle Growth and Strength\nCreatine and protein powder often soak up all of the glory for strength and muscular developments in the supplement world. But Vitamin D has proven to benefit muscle function and strength in numerous clinical studies; a study by Dr. Hassan-Smith actually found a link between lower muscle mass and lower Vitamin D levels [3]\nAnother study by the University of Birmingham [4] concluded that increased levels of active Vitamin D can help optimize muscle strength.\nSo next time you plan on improving your lifts and physique, don’t forget about the importance of keeping your Vitamins D levels optimal. A multivitamin containing this micronutrient can help do exactly that as you seek the most out of all your gains.\nB Vitamins for Muscle Growth and Recovery\nYou probably didn’t know that Vitamin B6 and B12 both affect protein\nmetabolism. In fact, a study by Okada M [5] found that a high protein diet increases your requirement of B6.\nAs all bodybuilders know, you need to consume a certain amount of protein to either maintain or build muscle mass. But there will be many of you that don’t keep an eye on their Vitamin B6 intake. Not only that, consuming the recommended intake of Vitamin B6 has also shown to upregulate the gene expression of a number of factors that promote the growth and repair of skeletal muscle in a clinical study too [6]\nIt’s Difficult to Obtain Certain Micronutrients Naturally Through Your Diet\nThis is the bottom line. Unless you have a professional chef/nutritionist or the time to sit down and consume 6 meals per day, it can be difficult to reach optimal intakes of vitamins and minerals. For example, there’s many professionals out there who struggle to find the time to even take lunch breaks.\nOf course, you want to at least try to obtain all micronutrients through food. But multivitamin supplements provide you with a strong foundation to build on. A quality multivitamin can provide your body with the essentials, just by popping 2-4 capsules per day.\nVitamins and Minerals to Look for as a Bodybuilder in Multivitamins\nVitamin A\nThis is a fat-soluble vitamin that’s known for its ability to support your immune function and vision. It also plays a vital role in the normal formation of organs including your heart, lungs and kidneys [7].\nVitamin C\nEveryone knows that Vitamin C is ‘good for you’. It’s an essential micronutrient as your body can’t produce it naturally, meaning you have to obtain it through food or supplementation.\nVitamin C has also shown to play an important role in supporting your immune system, as well as in the absorption of other micronutrients such as Iron. Additionally, Vitamin C is also known for its antioxidant properties and is a co-factor in\ncollagen synthesis to help support your joint tissue and bone. While many of us know we should take it, it is important to actually take it.\nVitamin D3\nVitamin D3 is the most bioavailable form of Vitamin D found in supplements. It’s shown to be much more beneficial than the cheaper Vitamin D2 found in some multivitamins [8].\nKnown as ‘the sunshine vitamin’ it’s become known for its ability to support testosterone levels, as well as protein synthesis and your immune system [9].\nMany nutritionists often state that if they were to choose one micronutrient to supplement, then Vitamin D3 would be one of them strongly considered. This is an example of how important it is to consume sufficient Vitamin D levels.\nThe best multivitamin for men should contain over 100% of your recommendation daily allowance for Vitamin D. That means you should look at the ingredients list and make sure the dose of vitamin D is to your standard.\nVitamin E\nA powerful antioxidant that’s able to scavenge loose electrons that can damage cells and also boost your immune system. As well as this, Vitamin E is known for its ability to prevent clots from forming in heart arteries [10].\nB Complex Vitamins\nIf you’re not familiar with nutrition, you might not be aware of how many B Vitamins there are – 8 in total.\nWe’ve already mentioned earlier in this article about the benefits of Vitamins B6 and B12 (being able to promote the growth and repair of muscle mass). Being deficient in Vitamin B12 is more common than you think, with up to 15% of the general population found to be deficient in studies [11].\nThere’s even more reason to supplement with B Complex Vitamins if you’re vegetarian or vegan; However, vegans lack adequate sources of vitamin B12 from diet alone. Getting enough B vitamins should be at the top of your list and absolutely not overlooked.\nVitamins K1 + K2\nVitamin K is known for being able to help your body make proteins for healthy bones and tissues, as well as helping with blood clotting too [12]. It’s found naturally in some foods as Natto, which\nLeanBulking classes as one of the best bodybuilding foods for vegetarians.\nAlso, importantly, taking Vitamin K2 while supplementing Vitamin D3 will ensure that calcium is absorbed optimally and reaches bone mass – while preventing arterial calcification.\nAs a result, any multivitamin that contains Vitamin D should also come with Vitamin K too. The good news is that Performance Lab NutriGenesis® Multi contains all the above, and more.\nBest Time to Take Multivitamins for Bodybuilding\nDifferent multivitamins will come with different instructions in terms of how frequently to take them. You might find one multivitamin with 1 daily serving, with others recommending up to 3-4 servings per day.\nWe believe the ‘sweet spot’ is 2 servings daily; this will make sure your body isn’t overwhelmed with a whole day’s worth of micronutrients in one serving, without making supplementation of a multivitamin too much of a hassle (you’re more likely to forget taking 4 servings per day than 2).\nIn terms of the best time to take multivitamins, whether it’s for general health, weightlifting or bodybuilding, most people consume their multivitamin in the morning and mid-afternoon. It is recommended to consume fat-soluble vitamins and minerals with food. And since the best multivitamins contain them, taking your first multivitamin serving with breakfast is a good idea.\nFinal Words\nWhen you think of\nbodybuilding supplements, the first products that come to mind are probably protein powder, pre-workout and creatine. But it’s so easy to neglect micronutrients, but finding the best multivitamin for bodybuilding can play a vital role in helping you attain peak health and support your muscle building/fat shredding journey.\nAs we’ve mentioned, it’s always best to try and obtain all of your micro and macronutrients naturally from your diet. But many of you live busy lifestyles and simply don’t have the time to plan all meals and nutrient intake. Supplements like multivitamins and protein powder give weightlifters and bodybuilders an easier option.\nSo, it’s no surprise that more gym goers are searching for the top options when it comes to multivitamins. Though multivitamins still remain as one of the\nmost underrated supplements in our opinion. We believe that Performance Lab® NutriGenesis® is the highest quality multivitamin currently on the market and that this supplement should absolutely be on your shelf. What you are really getting is a top tier multivitamin with great ingredients, an effective formula, and a reputable company backing you.

    "text": "Tras la llegada de la pandemia por COVID-19, el trámite de la visa americana tuvo grandes retrasos, por lo que se han implementado medidas y decisiones que puedan agilizar el proceso.\nUna visa americana es una llave para ingresar legalmente a los Estados Unidos por diferentes fines de viaje, como turismo, negocios, tratamiento médico, estudios o trabajo.\nSin embargo, para obtener el documento es necesario pasar por la entrevista consular, donde el oficial será el encargado de determinar si te aprueba o rechaza el visado de acuerdo a tus respuestas.\nDurante la entrevista consular es muy importante ser preciso con las respuestas que concuerden con la información que proporcionaste en el formulario DS-160 al momento de hacer la solicitud de la visa.\nAdemás, de acuerdo con algunos expertos, hay que demostrar lazos fuertes en el país de origen, es decir, dejar claro que se tienen importantes motivos para volver a México, ya sea por una vivienda, familia, estudios o un trabajo estable.\nPero eso no es todo, sino que también es importante no intentar agradarle al oficial consular y ser concreto en lo que dices, mo haciendo insinuaciones o dando a entender mensajes equivocados que lo hagan pensar que eres sospechoso.\nPor ello, aquí en Debate te dejamos algunas recomendaciones para tu entrevista consular de la visa americana:\n– No hablar de tener intenciones de quedarte a vivir en Estados Unidos o en un futuro, ni hacer planes a largo plazo.\n– No mencionar que se tienen intenciones de trabajar en la Unión Americana, ni como sueño ni objetivo.\n– No mencionar que tienes familia en Estados Unidos y menos si arribaron al país de forma ilegal o sin permiso de trabajo y permanencia.\n– No recordar alguna experiencia de la visa rechazada o documentación negada.\n– No proporcionar detalles turísticos en exceso, sin importar que ya tengas planeado el viaje.\n– No mencionar actividades laborales o prácticas que puedan ser dudosas o relacionarse con inmigración ilegal.\n– No hacer comentarios negativos sobre Estados Unidos, los ciudadanos, autoridades, políticas o procesos.\n– No proporcionar información falsa o dudosa que pueda llevar a que sea desmentida alguna pregunta o documento.\n– No dar a entender que no tiene trabajo, fuente de ingresos o estabilidad laboral\nEs muy importante que recuerdes llevar toda la información de forma ordenada, aunque no debes sacar los documentos a menos de que lo indique el cónsul y en caso de que funcione como una prueba para validar alguna de tus respuestas durante la entrevista.\nSi estás en busca de vuelos económicos, ingresa a este enlace de Skyscanner.

    "title": "Patriots’ thrilling win over Buffalo moves Belichick-Kraft chess match to second row",
    "text": "FOXBORO, Mass. — So much for all the talk that\nBill Belichick is a behind-the-times, yelling-at-clouds, 71-year-old NFL coach who can’t keep up with what the cool-kid coaches are doing.\nThink about it: Belichick possesses the stamina to prepare for not one but two big games each week. One of them is the next game on the schedule. The other is the chess match he’s playing against\nNew England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\nAdvertisement\nBut let’s hold off on the breakdown of the watered-down-soup of a handshake that took place between Belichick and Kraft on Sunday and the Sunday morning report by Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network that Belichick agreed to a “lucrative multiyear new contract” before the season started.\nYes, Belichick raised eyebrows with a handshake that I like to call “the Mangini.” And, yes, the contract extension begs all kinds of questions — not just how much it’s worth, but also who blabbed it. Make no mistake: The big story coming out of Gillette Stadium on Sunday was\nNew England’s thrilling 29-25 victory over the Buffalo Bills. The Pats didn’t just win the game, they also won over a dispirited fan base (for the time being, anyway) in that third-year quarterback Mac Jones led his team to victory with one of those everything’s-on-the-line, late-in-the-day drives that used to be a common occurrence around here when You Know Who was throwing the ball.\nGO DEEPER\nBill Belichick gets 300th win as Patriots stun Bills\nThe Pats were trailing 25-22 with 1:58 remaining when the final drive began with Jones throwing a short pass to\nRhamondre Stevenson that resulted in a 34-yard gain. The drive ended with Jones delivering a 1-yard pass to tight end Mike Gesicki for what would be the game winner.\nEight plays, 75 yards, one touchdown. These new kids on the block delivered old-timey Patriots football, and Gillette Stadium rocked in a way that hasn’t been felt, heard and seen all season.\nSo there’s that, the football part of the story.\nBut during the weeklong run-up to this latest slowdown between two ancient American Football League rivals, the Patriots were just your basic, lousy 1-5 team, and everyone in New England was wondering what Kraft was wondering about his coach.\nWould Kraft dare make an in-season coaching change? Will a move be made on Black Monday or soon thereafter? Kraft isn’t talking. Such was the dispatch with which he was whisked out of the NFL’s midseason meetings in New York last week that the only thing missing was a cartoonish sound effect and a puff of smoke rising from the floor where Kraft’s feet had been planted.\nAdvertisement\nFast forward to Saturday and the annual Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Belichick appeared on the stage and was seen shaking hands and embracing 2023 inductees Mike Vrabel and Dante Scarnecchia and other Patriots legends. When he came upon Kraft, however, Belichick pulled the Mangini, offering the quickest of handshakes and then moving on.\nAnd then came Sunday’s report from Rapoport about Belichick’s new contract extension. I can’t discern who leaked it. What I can tell you is that two possible secret messages are being sent here.\nSecret message from the Belichick camp: Oh, so they’re going to fire me, are they? Well, if they do it’s going to cost them a boatload of money — which I’ll be counting on the next boat to Nantucket.\nSecret message from the Kraft camp: We believed in Belichick. We set him up to succeed. If we have to fire him, we won’t care about the money because we will be doing what’s best for the team. (Which would be rich if they actually said that, since they’d be stealing one of Kraft’s favorite lines.)\nThe debate about the Saturday (barely) handshake might not be as controversial as people want to make it. For all we know, Belichick and Kraft might have already seen each other several times that day, whereas Belichick was seeing all these Patriots luminaries for the first time in months.\nI often wonder whether billionaires ever step into break rooms to make impulse purchases of Doritos. Maybe Kraft does. Maybe he sees Belichick in there. Translation: It’s not worth getting worked up over the handshake, even if, yeah, it was a weakling.\nBut this contract thing is proof positive that the chess game between Kraft and Belichick is real … and it’s fabulous.\nBelichick, who notched his 300th regular-season coaching victory Sunday, tying him with George Halas, was predictably silent when asked about the report by Rapoport.\nAdvertisement\n“I never talk about my contract,” Belichick said. “I focus on the game, try to focus on Buffalo. And now we focus on Miami.”\nBill Belichick declines opportunity to talk about his contract, asks for a softball from Zo, doesn’t get it, beats himself up for bad coaching moment, insults his own golf game. Action-packed 90 seconds or so.\n[pic.twitter.com/R5uVrzX9j0]\n— Michael Hurley (@michaelFhurley)\n[October 22, 2023]\nOr maybe he does talk about his contact — but strategically, not anecdotally.\nTo repeat: The Patriots registered a much-needed and very exciting victory over the Bills on Sunday. For Jones (25-for-30 for 272 yards, two touchdowns and a big drive in the last seconds of the fourth quarter), it was a chance to walk off the field with his head held high, a winner.\n“It’s just a crumb, and just keep picking up those crumbs and eventually you have a whole loaf of bread,” Jones said. It was a line he very much enjoyed because he stopped to add his own little chuckle before continuing: “That’s my goal, just continue to work, continue to be Mac like I said. It’s just one game, right?”\nOne deliciously entertaining, back-and-forth game.\nBut then we add the Belichick-Kraft chess match to the mix and it becomes clear the Patriots are going to continue being a ceaseless and intriguing lead story for the remainder of this NFL season and beyond — regardless of how many games they win or lose.\n(Top photo of Mike Gesicki and Mac Jones: Maddie Meyer / Getty Images)",

Photo: Milford Road Alliance More snow is on the way for alpine roads, while rain and strong winds are set to buffet parts of the South at the weekend.\nRoad snow warnings have been issued as a series of cold fronts move up the South Island.\nMetService says the cold air would bring chilly mornings, with temperatures on Sunday dropping close to 0°C for Otago, Southland and Canterbury.\nIn Southland, the Milford Road has been closed ahead of snow down to road level.\nThe Milford Road Alliance advised that State Highway 94 was shut from East Gate (Hollyford) to Donne River (Westgate) at 5pm today.\nMetService said between 3cm and 8cm of snow was forecast to settle above higher parts of the road, with lesser amounts down to 400 metres, in the 12 hours from 5am tomorrow.\nMore snow showers were expected above 400 metres during the afternoon, especially about southern parts of the road, and another 2cm of snow may accumulate.\nThe road was expected to reopen about 9.30am after ploughing work, Milford Road Alliance advised. The avalanche risk was currently low.\nFurther north, snow showers were likely on the Crown Range Road, linking Queenstown and Wānaka, on Saturday morning and afternoon, and up to 2cm may settle on the road above 400 metres.\nThe Lindis Pass (SH8) in Central Otago could see some snow flurries above 500 metres throughout the day, but little if any snow was expected to settle on the road.\nMeanwhile, rain and strong wind gusts were likely to affect most of the lower half of the South Island tomorrow.\nA strong wind watch has been issued for coastal parts of Dunedin, Clutha, Southland and Stewart Island from noon until 7pm. Westerly winds may approach severe gale in exposed places.\nMetService said rain and thunder with possible hail was likely for Stewart Island, Fiordland, coastal areas of Southland and Clutha, as well as Dunedin and North Otago on Saturday.\n- ODT Online",

    "title": "BlendJet recalls almost 5 million blenders on concerns over fire, blades - The Washington Post",
    "text": "An earlier version of this article misstated the number of injuries attributed to the BlendJet 2 devices. Fifty injuries have been reported, not hundreds. This article has been corrected. The China-manufactured blenders were sold between October 2020 and November 2023, retailing for $50 to $70, according to the commission. BlendJet is based in Benicia, Calif. In a statement to The Post, the company blamed many of the incidents on customers’ use of “low-quality” chargers and attempts to crush ice without first adding liquid. But BlendJet also said it has updated the blenders’ design with a new base that has “thicker blades and an improved electrical configuration.” Customers can contact the company for a free replacement, according to BlendJet’s website. Owners of the blenders can enter their devices’ serial numbers on the company’s site to see whether they’re part of the recall. “You should immediately stop using your BlendJet 2 until you verify if your product is recalled,” the company said. A report by Consumer Reports raised safety concerns about the blender in August, though it wasn’t recalled until Thursday. In one complaint filed to the Consumer Product Safety Commission on Aug. 18, a BlendJet customer reported that “the blade in the portable mini blender broke off and almost became part of the morning breakfast.” BlendJet 2 blenders that are currently for sale are not subject to the recall, the company said. - December 28, 2023December 28, 2023 - Honda recalls 2.6 million vehicles in U.S. over fuel pump defectDecember 22, 2023Honda recalls 2.6 million vehicles in U.S. over fuel pump defectDecember 22, 2023 - FDA finds ‘extremely high’ lead levels in cinnamon in applesauce at Ecuador plantDecember 19, 2023FDA finds ‘extremely high’ lead levels in cinnamon in applesauce at Ecuador plantDecember 19, 2023",

    "text": "One of the major development teams working on Xbox's Perfect Dark reboot has laid off multiple employees this week, the studio has confirmed on social media.\nCrystal Dynamics, the Tomb Raider developer which has also been drafted in to work with Xbox on Perfect Dark, has let go of 17 workers in total. The team goes on to say that \"this change does not alter our current project plans\".\nHere's their full statement:\nThis morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.\nWe recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.\nCrystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans.\nAt the time of posting, Xbox's main Perfect Dark developer The Initiative hasn't announced any such layoffs, and we're assuming that the two teams are still working to bring the reboot together. Perfect Dark for Xbox Series X|S doesn't have a release date at this stage.\nWe did finally see the game in action last summer though, and the likes of Digital Foundry came away very impressed by Xbox's showing. If you want to take another look at last year's Perfect Dark footage for a quick refresher, we'll throw a link to that down below.\nThoughts on this unfortunate news? Discuss it with us in the comments section below.\nsource [spr.ly]",

    "text": "Leah Remini And Angelo Pagan Announce Divorce After 21 Years Of Marriage: 'Our Bond Is Still Strong—It’s Just Evolved' Leah Remini and Angelo Pagan announced their divorce on Thursday, August 29, emphasizing that while their relationship has changed, their bond remains strong as they embark on a new chapter. Leah Remini and Angelo Pagan are going their separate ways after more than two decades of marriage. The couple announced their decision to end their union after 21 years in a joint Instagram post on Thursday, August 29. “Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce,” the lengthy Instagram statement began. “This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us.” Later in their statement, the parting couple shared that they will keep celebrating holidays together, watching their favorite TV shows together, and gathering as a family. Being aware that this promise would bring the attention of their admirers to the reason for the divorce, Remini and Pagan shared that they both have simply changed a lot over the past few years, hence the decision to take the step that would better reflect who they are today. “Our bond is still strong—it’s just evolved into something different,” they explained. Noting that they feel it is worth celebrating a marriage that lasted this long, the duo expressed that they are now looking forward to being in each other’s lives and making more cherished memories together, but in a different way. As for the decision to share the news publicly, the soon-to-be former couple shared that they felt it would only be fair to share it with their fans because they shared the marriage “so publicly” on TV over the years. Remini and Pagan expressed hope to inspire others to see that relationships, even when they change or end, aren't failures. “We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this chapter,” they concluded. Remini and Pagan got married in Las Vegas in 2003 after the actress first met him in 1996 while he was performing at El Floridita, a Cuban club and restaurant in LA. “For me, it was love at first sight,” Remini recalled during a 2010 interview with Redbook magazine. In 2019, she opened up about their first meeting during an appearance on RuPaul, recalling seeing Pagan across the room and making all the “wrong” decisions, including asking him what time he gets off work. Over the years, Remini and Pagan worked together on various occasions, including on her hit sitcom The King of Queens, where he made several guest appearances. The soon-to-be exes are parents to daughter, Sofia Bella, whom they welcomed on June 16, 2004. Pagan also has three sons from a previous relationship.
