    "text": "The US government asked the judge to force Google to sell its Chrome browser, in a measure aimed at combating the monopolistic practices the technology giant is accused of.\nThe request is a change in the strategy of the US government’s competition authorities, who have left the technology giants alone since they failed to break up Microsoft almost two decades ago of Google, which is linked to the Alphabet group By preventing the group from terminating agreements with smartphone manufacturers that make its search engine the main browser on those phones, and prevent it from using the their Android operating system, and in response to the government’s request, the head of global affairs in Google’s Kent Walker said that judicial officials “have chosen to advance the agenda of radical intervention.”\nHe pointed out that the proposal would “undermine a range of Google products. “\nLast summer, a federal judge in Washington, Amit Mehta, convicted Google of illegal practices to establish and maintain its monopoly in the field of online search.\nFollow our latest local and sports news and the latest political and economic developments through Google news\nDepartment Facebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPin of interest\nWhats App 2024-11-22 00:00:00\n#government #court #force #Google #sell #Chrome\n**How might the​ potential sale of Chrome impact the development and integration of future ⁢Google products and services?** ## World ⁤Today News Exclusive ⁢Interview: The Future ⁣of Google⁤ Chrome\n**Introduction**\nWelcome back to World Today⁤ News.

Dr. Carter, what lessons can we learn from that experience, and how might they ⁢apply to the Google case? ⁣\n**Dr.​ Carter:**\n**(Discusses the outcomes of⁤ the Microsoft case,⁣ the evolution‍ of antitrust‌ law in the ​digital ​age, the challenges of regulating rapidly changing technologies, and the potential long-term impact on the ​power dynamics within Big Tech.)**\n**Host:** Mr. ​Thompson,‌ with so much of our ⁣lives now intertwined with technology ‍companies, how ⁤do you see this case ⁣shaping the broader conversation about the‍ role and responsibilities of ⁤Big Tech in society?\n**Mr. Thompson:**\n**(Explores the public perception ‍of Big Tech, the growing concerns about data privacy and online censorship, the need ⁢for government regulation‌ and ‍oversight, and the potential for a more balanced and equitable digital ⁢future.)**\n**Section‌ 3: ‌Looking Ahead – Potential​ Scenarios and the Path Forward**\n**Host:** Dr. Carter, what are the possible ​outcomes of this lawsuit, ‌and what could they ⁣mean for Google, the‌ tech industry, ​and​ consumers?\n**Dr. Carter:**\n**(Discusses the⁢ potential scenarios – Google‌ selling Chrome, facing fin es, ⁢implementing changes to its business practices, and the ⁤possible appeals process. ​Also, addresses⁣ the potential impact ‌on ⁤the future of antitrust ⁣regulation and the tech industry landscape.)**\n**Host:** Mr.⁢ Thompson, what are your predictions for the ⁢future ‌of Google Chrome and the broader browser market, regardless of the lawsuit’s ⁤outcome?\n**Mr.⁢ Thompson:**\n**(Shares his insights on the future​ of browsing technology, the emergence ​of new competitors ‌and alternative browser ‍solutions, and the​ evolving needs and preferences of consumers in a​ digitally-driven world.)**\n**Closing**\n**Host:** Thank you both for sharing your invaluable insights ⁤on this ‌important and complex ​issue.

    "text": "by Laurie Sullivan , Staff Writer @lauriesullivan , October 17, 2024\nYouTube citations rose in Google AI Overviews (AIO) by more than 300% since the beginning of August and 200% since September, according to data released Thursday.\nEcommerce-related YouTube citations have increased by 121% as the holiday season gets underway.\nJim Yu, founder of enterprise SEO platform BrightEdge, pointed to the ability for AI Overviews to summarize YouTube videos.\n“Google’s AI will watch and listen to the video to summarize the content,” he said, suggesting that the AI technology caches content to make it easier and quicker to access.\n“I think it’s integrated into AI Overviews and creates a bulleted list. It’s a natural part of the AI experience,” Yu added.\nThe growth in YouTube AI-related citations is significant for two reasons, according to the company’s report.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nAs a user-generated content platform, it provides businesses with an additional channel to leverage their community's voice or directly build content that could function as a citation -- and sourcing YouTube is a clear demonstration of Google Gemini's multimodal capabilities.\nVideos have been part of search results for years, but in these instances, texts such as descriptions or transcripts are used to rank the video.\nBrightEdge has identified data in Gemini content, so the video can be cited to help generate an answer to a query.\nContent in YouTube -- the second-largest search engine -- was cited as a source at least once in as much as 60% of the AI Overviews tracked by BrightEdge Generative Parser in September.\nBrightEdge’s report pointed to video as becoming a dominant medium in AI-generated results.\nAlthough ecommerce has not fully caught up, the rise in video content overall suggests brands need to prioritize optimizing video assets for YouTube to capitalize on the trend.\nThe data also identified volatility in shopping queries that fell from 37% in early August to 26% in late September.\nAs the holiday shopping season approaches, the data identified a trend where shopping-related queries have stabilized.\nYu also shared overall trends around shopping and ecommerce in Google Search. “Don’t over depend on AI Overviews,” he said. “It’s important to keep optimizing for traditional search content.”\nAs AI Overview and Gemini become increases in multimodal, it will become more important to have and optimize different types of content, he said.\nBrightEdge also shared data on SearchGPT’s growth rate of 150% month-over-month.\nIt also now sends brands 4x more referrals than Perplexity and Claude, which grew 22% in the same month.",
