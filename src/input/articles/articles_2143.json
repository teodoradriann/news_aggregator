    "text": "In Vermont, the state's minimum wage will reach $13.67 - climbing $0.49 from the current $13.18 wage. The annual adjustment also affects the minimum wage for tipped workers, which will tick up from $6.59 to $6.84 per hour.BOSTON - Workers in several New England states are looking forward to a bump up in the minimum wage in 2024 while advocates in Massachusetts are pushing a ballot question aimed at phasing out the state's subminimum wage of $6.75 per hour for tipped workers. In Rhode Island, the state's current $13 minimum wage will jump by $1 to $14 an hour on Jan. 1. It is the next step in a phased-in increase that will reach $15 in 2025. In Vermont, the state's minimum wage will reach $13.67 - climbing $0.49 from the current $13.18 wage. The annual adjustment also affects the minimum wage for tipped workers, which will tick up from $6.59 to $6.84 per hour. Maine will see its hourly minimum wage tick up from $13.80 to $14.15 per hour. Maine requires annual adjustments to the minimum wage based on the cost-of-living. Portland is pushing its city minimum wage from $14 to $15. The state's new tipped wage in 2024 will be $7.08 per hour. The minimum wage in Connecticut will rise from the current rate of $15.00 per hour to $15.69 - the highest in New England. Beginning Jan. 1, and occurring annually each following Jan. 1, the wage will be adjusted according to the U.S. Department of Labor's calculation of the employment cost index. Massachusetts' minimum wage will remain at $15 per hour in 2024, although there is a campaign to hike the wage again to $20. New Hampshire continues to have the lowest minimum wage in New England, matching the federal wage of $7.25. State lawmakers have defeated multiple attempts to increase it in recent years. The New England states are among 20 raising minimum wages for workers, further widening the gap between state requirements and the federal minimum wage, which has been static at $7.25 an hour since July 2009. In several states, the new minimum will more than double that rate. In Massachusetts, advocates are pushing a ballot question that would phase out the state's \\\"service rate\\\" which lets restaurants pay workers $6.75 an hour if tips make up the difference between that and the state's $15 minimum wage. Under the question, the service rate would end by 2029. Organizers for the group One Fair Wage said they have collected enough signatures to clear an initial hurdle to gaining a slot on next year's ballot. \\\"Massachusetts voters are ready to move away from outdated wage practices and towards a system that guarantees dignity, justice, and economic security for all workers,\\\" Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, said in a written statement, The Massachusetts Restaurant Association opposes the question, saying the highest-paid employees in any restaurant are tipped employees, frequently averaging $20, $30, and sometimes even $50 per hour. A restaurant owner can employ more than two full time waitstaff employees for the same hourly rate as one minimum wage employee, said Jessica Muradian of Massachusetts Restaurant Association. \\\"This is a win for the tipped employee because they are the highest compensated employee in the restaurant, it's a win for the guest who is getting a full-service experience and a win for the restaurant operator who gets to employ as many people as possible,\\\" she said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Labor in August has also announced a proposed rule that would let 3.6 million more workers qualify for overtime. The proposed regulation would require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers who are in executive, administrative and professional roles but make less than $1,059 a week, or $55,068 a year for full-time employees. That salary threshold is up from $35,568.",

    "text": "Giornata internazionale delle cooperative, Legacoop premia Kyoto club per i GreenHeroes La Giornata internazionale delle cooperative si festeggia da oltre un secolo (1923), prima ancora che venisse ufficialmente proclamata dall’Onu nel 1995, e quest’anno è dedicata al tema Le cooperative costruiscono un futuro migliore per tutti. Per dare un senso concreto alla celebrazione, oggi Legacoop ha scelto di premiare col riconoscimento “Amici della cooperazione” A.S. Roma e Kyoto club, due realtà molto diverse tra loro che sono però accomunate dall’aver valorizzato e promosso il modello cooperativo come leva per l’inclusione sociale e la sostenibilità. «Ispirate a valori di solidarietà, partecipazione, democrazia, le cooperative – dichiara Simone Gamberini, presidente Legacoop – rappresentano un modello imprenditoriale e sociale radicato nei territori di insediamento, svolgendo un ruolo di sostegno alla crescita del benessere delle comunità, sviluppando reti di relazioni, valorizzando le risorse locali, integrando filiere produttive, promuovendo collaborazioni, creando opportunità. Siamo convinti che la cooperazione possa offrire un contributo importante alla costruzione di un modello di sviluppo più equo, inclusivo e sostenibile sotto il profilo economico, sociale e ambientale». Una prospettiva cui la no-profit Kyoto club aderisce appieno, sin dalla sua nascita nel 1999, quando ha iniziato a mettere insieme imprese, enti, associazioni e amministrazioni locali, per lottare contro la crisi climatica tagliando le emissioni di gas serra. Ma il premio arrivato al Kyoto club è legato a un progetto in particolare, quello dei GreenHeroes, che dal 2019 – capitanato da Annalisa Corrado e Alessandro Gassmann – dà visibilità e mette a rete le migliori esperienze nazionali in fatto di economia verde; un nucleo di realtà “eroiche” cui dal [febbraio di quest’anno](https://archivio.greenreport.it/news/economia-ecologica/e-greenreport-il-primo-quotidiano-a-entrare-a-fare-parte-dei-greenheroes-italiani/) anche greenreport è onorato di far parte, come primo e finora unico giornale italiano. «Il premio assegnato a Kyoto club – precisa Gamberini – riconosce il suo impegno nel campo della sostenibilità ambientale e l’aver valorizzato, attraverso la campagna ‘Greenheroes’ lanciata nel 2019, le attività delle cooperative nella transizione green, con particolare riferimento al loro ruolo nei processi di costituzione di comunità energetiche rinnovabili o di economia circolare». Non a caso, sono già molte le cooperative entrate a far parte dei GreenHeroes: le cooperative Ènostra, Terra Felix, Cooperativa l’orto, Cooperativa Briganti di Cerreto, Comunità cooperativa Melpignano, Cooperativa Cadore Scs, Cartiera Pirinoli, Calcestruzzi Ericina Libera, Cooperativa di comunità Artemisia di Castel del Giudice, Cooperativa miticoltori spezzini, Industria plastica toscana, Progetto Quid, Cooperativa sociale Rigenerazioni Onlus. «Ringraziamo Legacoop per questo riconoscimento di cui siamo orgogliosi – dichiara il vicepresidente del Kyoto club, Francesco Ferrante – e che condivido con la nostra Annalisa Corrado, ideatrice della campagna GreenHeroes e, soprattutto, con Alessandro Gassmann che con generosità mette la sua faccia, la sua penna (con gli articoli che ogni settimana scrive su Il Venerdì di Repubblica) e la sua popolarità a servizio della nostra causa. Kyoto Club, sin dalla sua nascita, sostiene che la questione ambientale non rappresenta solo un vincolo da rispettare, ma anche una straordinaria opportunità di fare nuova economia. I GreenHeroes sono la concreta esperienza delle nostre idee; e le best practices delle cooperative qui riunite sono la dimostrazione che non solo ‘si può fare’ ma che il connubio tra economia e sostenibilità ambientale è anche la via migliore da imboccare per un futuro più solido e stabile».",

    "title": "¿Pista o casualidad? La serie sobre un gran ataque sorpresa a Israel que Hamás filmó en respuesta a ‘Fauda’ | Televisión | EL PAÍS",
    "text": "Los líderes del brazo armado de Hamás deciden dar inicio a un gran ataque que, en palabras de uno de ellos, “sorprenderá al enemigo [Israel] y cambiará las reglas del juego”. Apenas un puñado de personas conocen los detalles, que preparan desde hace tiempo: consiste en derribar las torres de control en la barrera fronteriza, poner bombas bajo blindados para capturar rehenes y tomar una base militar. No, no es la realidad, tampoco se trata de los días previos al ataque que la milicia islamista lanzó el 7 de octubre de 2023, dejando casi 1.200 muertos, capturando 251 rehenes y desencadenando una sangrienta invasión (40.000 palestinos muertos) que ha incendiado Oriente Próximo como nunca en medio siglo . Es El puño de los libres , una serie de ficción filmada un año antes en Gaza por el propio Gobierno de Hamás con el objetivo explícito de competir con Fauda , la exitosa serie israelí en Netflix sobre un grupo de mistaravim , la unidad de élite que se entrena para mimetizarse con los palestinos. Tanto que los mistaravim en la serie de Hamás tienen, casualmente, un líder calvo y una mujer, como en Fauda . La serie ―que lleva por título el nombre de la macroperación que prepara Hamás en la ficción— fue emitida en el mes sagrado de Ramadán (cuando los musulmanes de medio mundo se enganchan a las series) de 2022. Primero en Al Aqsa, la televisión vía satélite del movimiento islamista; y luego en Al Manar, la del partido-milicia libanés Hezbolá. Sus 30 capítulos, de unos 50 minutos, pasaron sin pena ni gloria. Si ahora ha resucitado, no es por su ―discutible― calidad, sino por las pistas de lo que se avecinaba el 7 de octubre (aprovechando la etiqueta de ficción) que algunos ven a posteriori . Tanques ardiendo en la frontera, combates entre soldados y milicianos... Algunas secuencias de El puño de los libres parecen directamente sacadas del ataque real. Cuando la ofensiva comienza, un mando israelí se lleva las manos a la cabeza: “El país está viviendo un evento grave y muy inusual que no podemos explicar. El cuartel general en el sur está en la línea de fuego. Lo que sucede es totalmente anormal. No tenemos satélites, ni aviones, ni drones”. Se estima que, en el momento del rodaje, Hamás ya tenía en marcha los preparativos secretos de Diluvio de Al Aqsa. Los indicios no están tanto en la grabación (buscar profecías a toro pasado es siempre ventajista y tramposo) como en unas frases que hoy parecen cobrar otro sentido. Las pronunció, al presentar la serie, nada menos que Yahia Sinwar, el cerebro de Diluvio de Al Aqsa y enemigo número uno de Israel, al que Hamás acaba de nombrar líder político tras el asesinato en Teherán de Ismail Haniya . “Aplaudo los esfuerzos de todos los que habéis creado y trabajado en esta serie. Vuestro trabajo nos acerca a la liberación. Esta serie es parte integral de lo que preparamos en las Brigadas [de Ezedin Al Qasam, el brazo armado de Hamás]. Desde las armas producidas en laboratorios a los planes y capacidades de obtener información de inteligencia”, dijo antes de entregar personalmente los galardones al equipo. En aquel momento, los servicios de inteligencia israelíes desdeñaban con condescendencia las señales y advertencias. La serie está inspirada en un hecho real: una operación fallida israelí de incógnito en Jan Yunis, en el sur de Gaza, en 2018. En la realidad, los descubrieron vecinos de la zona, al sospechar de gente que nadie conocía. Acabó en un enfrentamiento en el que los israelíes salieron mucho mejor parados: rescataron a 16 hombres, mataron a siete palestinos y perdieron un solo agente. En la producción de Hamás, que aún se pueden encontrar en Internet, la historia cambia. Es el propio objetivo, Abu Anas, quien se da cuenta de que lo persiguen y sale a combatir. En Fauda , sería un malo malísimo; aquí, es un padre de familia amoroso, afable y sonriente que sacrifica su vida “por la liberación de Palestina”. Lucha con valentía, pero le disparan en el cuello un dardo sedante. Hamás lanza entonces la operación, con andanadas de cohetes, justamente como hizo de verdad al alba del 7 de octubre, como señuelo de la infiltración masiva. “Hemos conseguido romper el mito de que el ejército enemigo es invencible […]. El puño de los libres debe ser nuestro plan para sorprender al enemigo y cambiar las reglas del juego. Todo el mundo conocerá el Puño de los libres”, dice uno de los líderes en la serie, tras regañar a los milicianos en un entrenamiento por salir a capturar soldados en un tanque sin derribar antes las torres de control. Algo que sí hicieron el 7 de octubre. A diferencia de Fauda , los agentes israelíes son medio torpes. Si en la vida real, los arrestados palestinos son desnudados, esposados y reclinados durante horas con los ojos vendados y las rodillas en el suelo, aquí una unidad de élite pasa horas sin darse cuenta de que Abu Anas lleva un cuchillo escondido en el calcetín. Algunos planos están grabados con cámaras GoPro, adosadas al cuerpo, por lo que se asemejan aún más a las que grabaron en la vida real los milicianos y se han ido difundiendo estos meses. Todo con mucha música dramática, muchos subrayados y mucha cámara lenta, al puro estilo de las series populares en el mundo árabe. Hamás creó un departamento de producción artística tras tomar el control de Gaza en 2007. Su responsable, Mohammed Soraya, admitió a la cadena Al Jazeera en 2022 que El puño de los libres buscaba “mostrar el punto de vista de la resistencia palestina y el espíritu de pelea para resistir a la ocupación”, para contrarrestar el “engaño” y la “gran influencia en el público” de Fauda . “Netflix está apoyando la ocupación sionista al producir muchas series como Fauda , que presentan al pueblo palestino como criminales”, agregó. La serie tiene todas las limitaciones de haber sido rodada en una Gaza bajo bloqueo . No hay estudios, así que grabaron durante medio año solo en decorados naturales y de día. Carecían de equipo para tomas nocturnas. En una ocasión, los soldados israelíes abrieron fuego contra el rodaje, pensando que era real. Algunos picados se grabaron con el cámara subido a hombros de otro. El presupuesto: 78.000 euros. Buena parte de los actores eran aficionados y, obviamente, no había israelíes para hacer de tales, a diferencia de Fauda, donde los personajes palestinos hablan árabe y los israelíes, hebreo (o árabe, cuando están en una operación especial o bromean entre ellos). Es como esas películas de Hollywood en las que todos hablan inglés entre sí en el extranjero. Zohair Al-Belbisi, el intérprete de 65 años que da vida a un oficial del Shin Bet (los servicios secretos interiores), parece más egipcio que israelí, pero se reunió con exreclusos para preparar el personaje. Más allá de su carácter o no profético, la serie supone una ventana al universo islamista palestino. La familia es el centro y sostén de los guerreros. Las mujeres deben vigilar sus movimientos para no dar pistas al enemigo. Un protagonista halaga a su hijo llamándole Ezedín Al Qasam, el influyente predicador que luchó para expulsar a británicos, franceses y sionistas de Oriente Próximo y del que toma su nombre el brazo armado de Hamás. Algunos diálogos son más bien arengas al televidente para elevar la moral: “Claro que el enemigo tiene un arsenal sofisticado, pero nosotros tenemos una voluntad inquebrantable. Sí, son poderosos, combaten, pero temen morir. Nosotros, no; y creemos en que Dios nos dará la victoria”.

    "text": "Un espectáculo de auroras boreales iluminó el cielo de la ciudad de Nueva York la noche de este jueves, dejando imágenes pocas veces vistas en la bahía.\nUna tormenta solar geomagnética “severa” hizo que las auroras boreales fueran visibles en Estados Unidos más al sur de lo habitual, generando este evento, que suele ser bastante elusivo, para el deleite de los observadores de estrellas de toda la zona triestatal.\nLos expertos dijeron que podría haber auroras boreales tenues en Canadá y ciudades del norte de Estados Unidos hasta la mañana del viernes , comentó ABC News. Residentes de la bahía de Nueva York, Long Island y Nueva Jersey compartieron imágenes del fenómeno celeste multicolor que a muchos tomó por sorpresa la noche del jueves.\nSpectacular view of the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) from the office this evening. pic.twitter.com/tqZeykveL1\n— NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) October 10, 2024 https://twitter.com/DanTVusa/status/1844565471976112209 Las auroras boreales son un fenómeno natural que ocurre cuando partículas cargadas del sol chocan con la atmósfera terrestre, provocando un resplandor luminoso en el cielo . En inglés se las conoce como “Northern Lights” (luces del norte).\nEl fenómeno es causado por perturbaciones en la magnetósfera de la Tierra, en este caso, desencadenadas por una eyección de masa coronal (CME) del Sol. Las CME tienen la posibilidad de causar interferencias con radios y satélites y, en algunos casos, pueden afectar la red eléctrica, destacó Fox News.\nCuando una CME -explosión masiva de viento solar y campos magnéticos- es lanzada hacia la Tierra, interactúa con el campo magnético de nuestro planeta. Estas partículas solares cargadas chocan con los gases de la atmósfera terrestre, lo que hace que emitan luz. Los colores de la aurora varían según el tipo de gas involucrado: el oxígeno crea tonos verdes y rojos, mientras que el nitrógeno contribuye a los morados y azules.\nThe Devils getting scored on first is almost as rare as the Northern Lights being visible in New Jersey.
