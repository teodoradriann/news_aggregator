    "text": "La temperatura media en China en julio fue la más alta registrada en dicho mes desde 1961, según el Centro Meteorológico Nacional. Durante el séptimo mes del año, la temperatura media en el país asiático alcanzó los 23,2 grados, 1,1 grados más alta que la temperatura en años considerados normales, informó este jueves el subdirector de la institución, Jia Xialong, citado hoy por el diario China Daily. \"En julio, China se enfrentó a una combinación de lluvias extremas y temperaturas extremadamente altas en todo el país\", señaló Jia en un evento en Pekín. El sur de China sufrió una ola de calor generalizada y prolongada, con múltiples regiones experimentando altas temperaturas continuas durante más de 20 días. Un total de 59 estaciones meteorológicas nacionales registraron temperaturas máximas diarias que rompieron o igualaron récords históricos. Los récords de calor se rompieron en todo el mundo el mes pasado, siendo el 22 de julio el día más caluroso registrado en la Tierra, con una temperatura media diaria global de 17,15°C. El aumento repentino de la temperatura media diaria del 21 al 22 de julio se debió principalmente a temperaturas significativamente más altas de lo normal en el hemisferio norte, particularmente en América del Norte y Europa, así como en la mayor parte de la Antártida, explicó el experto. Según las previsiones del Centro, las temperaturas en la mayor parte de China seguirán siendo más altas de lo habitual en agosto: se esperan dos olas de calor significativas en la primera mitad de agosto, y se prevé que las altas temperaturas disminuyan a finales de mes. En julio, fuertes precipitaciones dejaron más de una treintena de fallecidos y cientos de miles de damnificados en el centro de China. En los últimos veranos, los eventos climáticos extremos han causado estragos en el gigante asiático: los meses estivales de 2023 estuvieron marcados por las citadas inundaciones en Pekín, mientras que, en 2022, diversas olas de calor extremo y sequías azotaron el centro y el este del país. En julio de 2021, precipitaciones de una intensidad inédita en décadas dejaron casi 400 muertos en la provincia central de Henan, que el Ejecutivo chino achacó a una \"falta de preparación y de percepción de riesgo\" por parte de las autoridades locales .

    "title": "Alessandro Lequio, muy duro con Naty Abascal a raíz de una publicación de Pilar Rubio: \"No se la entiende cuando habla\"",
    "text": "Alessandro Lequio ha bromeado este jueves en Telecinco sobre la charla que Naty Abascal y Pilar Rubio han anunciado a través de sus redes sociales. Y es que, según el conde, la modelo no es la persona más adecuada para realizar una entrevista. \"Me extraña que alguien le haga una entrevista a Naty Abascal porque yo la conozco y no se la entiende cuando habla\", ha comentado el tertuliano en Vamos a ver . Unas palabras a las que Adriana Dorronsoro ha respondido agregando que, precisamente, la entrevistadora era la modelo puesto que \"trabaja para una revista\". El conde ha recalcado que \"eso no es así\", pues Naty Abascal \"es una freelance y ahora no trabaja para nadie\": \"Adriana, sabes que cuando tienes razón no te digo nada, pero es que eso no es así\". Esta pequeña discusión se ha producido cuando los tertulianos debatían sobre la publicación de varias fotografías por parte de Pilar Rubio y Naty Abascal, en las que no aparece Sergio Ramos. Las instantáneas pertenecen a una entrevista que ambas compartirán pronto y que, ante la ausencia del futbolista, han avivado los rumores de crisis entre Rubio y Ramos. La presentadora y el jugador del Sevilla FC subrayan que están \"muy bien\" , pero su distanciamiento en los planes familiares desata las dudas de sus seguidores, que están acostumbrados a verlos muy unidos en sus publicaciones de Instagram, donde suelen aparecer, además, junto a sus hijos. Aunque ambos compartieran hace unos días un vídeo donde aparecían montando en familia el árbol de Navidad, la ausencia de Rubio en los vídeos que Ramos compartió de Nochebuena hizo sospechar. Hay quienes señalan que ambas partes están cansadas del goteo de informaciones , aunque otros dicen que su relación \"pende de un hilo\" .",

    "text": "Cognition and neuroscience doctoral student Marisol Moreno placed third in the poster competition for her research on the potential role of an antibody regulating sensory neuron cells in patients reporting chronic neck pain. Mechanical engineering doctoral student Keshav Panthi presented his research on wake interactions between floating offshore wind turbines. Chemistry doctoral students Upeksha Dissanayake (left) and Arkanil Roy are shown with UTD mascot Temoc during the PhD Student Poster Competition and Art Showcase. The PhD Student Poster Competition and Art Showcase featured an art component for the first time. First-, second- and third-place winners of the competitions were awarded $600, $400 and $200, respectively. Graduate students at The University of Texas at Dallas recently presented their research at the PhD Student Poster Competition and Art Showcase , an annual event that highlights research and provides students with the opportunity to share their scholarly work with the campus community.\nThe event showcased projects from more than 70 students, and attendees voted for their favorite presenters. Six winners were determined from the nearly 500 votes cast, and cash prizes of $600, $400 and $200 were given to the first-, second- and third-place winners of the poster competition and the art showcase, respectively.\nStudents from the Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology , the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences (BBS), the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science , and the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NSM) competed in the event.\nThe poster competition’s first-place prize was awarded to Rafah Falah, a molecular and cell biology doctoral student, for research on the role of chronic inflammation in patients with breast cancer tumors resistant to a common hormone therapy. Second place went to Waris Khuwaja, a molecular and cell biology doctoral student, for research on the bladder immune mechanisms against uropathogenic E. coli infections. Third place went to Marisol Moreno, a cognition and neuroscience doctoral student, for work researching the potential role of an antibody regulating sensory neuron cells in patients reporting chronic neck pain.\nThis year also featured an inaugural art showcase, which was added to include more students from different disciplines. First place went to Niyati Arora, a chemistry doctoral student, for a painting in the style of Vincent van Gogh of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from the “Harry Potter” series.\n“The research office recognizes that UTD is a school where students study a wide variety of subjects,” said DeMia Keppel, associate director of research events and marketing for the Office of Research and Innovation , which helps coordinate the competition. “Our campus thrives on interdisciplinary collaborations in research and the arts. Spotlighting the arts in a unique showcase provided this opportunity.”\nChris Gauthier and Brandon Coffey, both game development graduate students and second-place winners of the art showcase, created a video walk-through using a virtual reality (VR) interface of Clark Hulings’ painting “Woodbearers of Chimayo.”\n“When you walk by a painting in a museum, you just see another painting,” Gauthier said. “You don’t necessarily process all the 3D information that’s in it. But once you see it in VR, everything takes on a whole other meaning.”\nFor Coffey, the immersive experience offers a unique integration of art and science.\n“Our degree lets us explore how we can take our research and our artistic skills and put them together to create something that’s meaningful,” he said. “It’s a lot more powerful than if you looked at a pamphlet or a book.”\nGeosciences doctoral student Gabriella Putri presented research on using artificial intelligence to enhance Earth science imaging. Soham Raghavendra Jorapur, a chemistry doctoral student, took advantage of the art showcase to practice communicating his research through the power of imagery, earning him the showcase’s third-place prize.\n“I wanted to expand my science communications portfolio into a visual medium,” he said. “So, I made an artistic representation of a recent scientific breakthrough that was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry.”\nJorapur pulled from his love of watercolor, a hobby of his since the age of 10, and his passion for chemistry to paint Top7, an entirely new protein designed by Nobel laureate Dr. David Baker.\n“To make this artwork, I looked into the history of protein design and blended those insights with computational developments that have allowed scientists to venture into previously uncharted protein territory,” he said.\nGabriella Putri attended last year’s poster competition to learn more about her fellow students’ research interests. This year, the geosciences doctoral student showcased her own research in her presentation titled “Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Improve Hessian De-Blurring Operators for Enhanced High-Resolution Earth Science Imaging.”\n“Being in the poster competition allowed me to practice my skills as a presenter,” Putri said. “And that’s something that’s very important as a PhD student — not just conducting the research, but also learning how to communicate the research to a broad audience.”\nAs a mechanical engineering doctoral student, Bernadette Magalindan BS’21 hopes to reduce society’s reliance on the machines it uses to regulate temperature, such as air conditioners, heating units and fans.\n“I study eco-friendly methods to synthesize thermal energy storage materials that can passively store and release heat depending on the temperature,” she said. “This can be manipulated to our advantage to sustain more comfortable temperatures in buildings.\n“Whenever I’m presenting a poster, especially in the Research Days format, it always reminds me to reflect on the broader impact of my work. It all has to boil down to meeting a specific need for a specific purpose.”",

    "title": "The night I helped sink Hitler's monster battleship: In mountainous Arctic seas, a young officer spotted the vessel trying to escape a Royal Navy trap. What followed was a clash of giants that will never be seen again. Incredibly, he's still alive at 101 | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Perched at his freezing post above the bridge of the destroyer HMS Scorpion, 21-year-old sub-lieutenant Tony Ditcham stared through his binoculars into the midwinter Arctic darkness, searching for the German battlecruiser. Suddenly star-shells burst overhead 'and where there'd been nothing but black there was this enormous ship, brilliantly illuminated'. Ditcham radioed 'Enemy in sight!' to the gun team below. Thus, 80 years ago, began the final phase of the last great battle of the Royal Navy's war, a clash of giants that will never be seen again. Ditcham is one of the very few survivors of the Battle Of The North Cape, fought in the terrible cold and mountainous seas of the Arctic winter on December 26, 1943. At the age of 101, he is still full of energy, eyes twinkling as he sits in the oak-beamed lounge of a friend's house overlooking the rolling Shropshire countryside recalling in detail the now all-but-forgotten showdown between the leviathan Scharnhorst and the British fleet led by Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser in his flagship Duke of York. Tony Ditcham is one of the very few survivors of the Battle Of The North Cape, fought in the seas of the Arctic winter on December 26, 1943 Tony was a pre-war naval cadet and had already been decorated for his heroism serving in destroyers when he learned that he and his Scorpion shipmates were about to be launched on the hunt to sink Hitler's last big serviceable warship. On December 22, as they sat in harbour in Iceland, his captain, Lieutenant Commander Bill Clouston, returned from a conference on board Duke of York to tell them that Fraser had set a trap for Scharnhorst which, if all went well, would send her to the icy bottom of the Barents Sea. Tony and the rest of the crew were exhausted after long Arctic convoy duty 'ploughing across filthy seas in filthy weather and arriving at the other end to a bleak welcome' from the Soviets, who never showed the slightest gratitude for the Allied war supplies or the risks taken in delivering them. They were facing a bleak Christmas in Iceland with no prospect of seeing their loved ones. However, the captain's news lifted their spirits. 'We welcomed the chance of firing the guns,' said Tony. 'We wanted the war won and the Scharnhorst sunk.' The trap was already being set. Having suspended convoys during the summer months when the long days made the merchantmen an easy target, they had now resumed and one had got through safely to Murmansk. Another — codenamed JW 55B — set off from Scotland on December 20 and would cross with the homebound convoy. 'So there would be two juicy convoys at sea' explained Tony. 'And Fraser reckoned that the Germans would find them irresistible.' The returning convoy, RA 55A, was protected by Force 1, commanded by Vice Admiral Bob Burnett, consisting of the cruisers Belfast, Norfolk and Sheffield and a destroyer escort. The outbound JW 55B would be followed by Force 2, comprising Duke of York, the cruiser Jamaica and a host of destroyers — but at a distance so as not to scare off Scharnhorst, then lying in Altafjord in Northern Norway. German battleship 'Scharnhorst' in Kiel harbour Hitler's big, expensive battleships had so far proved a disappointment, soaking up huge resources for little military return. Bismarck, the pride of the Kriegsmarine, had been sunk in an epic battle with the Royal Navy in May 1941. Her sister ship Tirpitz was lying crippled in another Norwegian fjord following a daring attack by British midget submarines. Only Scharnhorst remained at large in Northern waters, but even on her own she posed a mighty threat to the convoys, tying up large numbers of ships that could be put to much better use elsewhere. Scharnhorst had to go. But would the Kriegsmarine commander Admiral Karl Donitz oblige by seizing the chance to prove the ship's worth and in the process deliver a Christmas present to the Fuhrer? The early signs were encouraging. Luftwaffe reconnaissance patrols picked up the outbound convoy and began shadowing. Then the Bletchley Park codebreakers passed on a secret signal from Germany's naval HQ early on Boxing Day warning German shipping in the area that a flotilla led by Scharnhorst was at sea. By then Fraser and Force 2 were well on their way. Tony said that when the news was passed to the ships he felt 'a mixture of excitement, apprehension and professional pride in being involved in such a significant historical moment . . . our morale was high and our leaders were battle-hardened.' The task would be far from easy. Even with radar it would take skill and luck to locate their quarry in the Arctic darkness, relieved only briefly by midday twilight. Much would depend on Fraser's ability to read the mind of his opposite number, Admiral Erich Bey, a veteran seadog who commanded the enemy flotilla. Even though the Germans were outnumbered, the Scharnhorst was a match for any of the British ships. Her nine 11in guns could overpower the armament of the cruisers and she had a top speed of 31 knots, three knots faster than Duke of York. 'She was a formidable foe,' said Tony. 'She could get away if we tried to catch her and demolish anything of lighter weight.' As they butted through the iron-grey seas to cut the enemy off before she closed on the incoming convoy, the weather grew steadily more atrocious. That Boxing Day morning Tony took the forenoon watch and recalled that keeping up with Duke of York 'was not easy. We only saw each other if each was at the top of a wave at the same time and mostly we kept station by radar echoes off the foremast.' The wind and waves tore close-range guns off the front deck of the Duke and tossed them overboard, leaving gaping holes through which seawater cascaded into the hull. Adolf Hitler visits crew aboard the warship 'Scharnhorst' on April 2, 1939 All the ships were 'closed up', with only the officer of the watch, lookouts and signalmen allowed above decks. Down below the air stank of sweat and vomit. A seaman on board Scorpion who risked stepping outside for a breath of fresh air was swept away never to be seen again. At 9am a blip lit up the search radar of the Force 1 cruiser HMS Belfast protecting RA 55A. It was Scharnhorst, hunting for the convoy. Bey had sent his five accompanying destroyers off to track down the merchantmen, so the ship was unescorted. The Force 1 cruisers turned on the Scharnhorst and opened fire at a range of 13,000 yards [7.3 miles] with their six and eight-inch guns. In the duel that followed, Bey's ship was struck twice. One shell destroyed the forward radar controls. From now on, Bey would be fighting half blind and his gunners would have only the muzzle flashes of their enemies on which to fix their aim. He had little choice but to break off the fight, but was still determined to have a crack at the convoy which was now undefended. He circled round to the north-east to try and get at it, but Burnett second-guessed him. Force 1 moved to intercept and there was another exchange of fire in which the Scharnhorst's gunners managed to hit Norfolk. But the odds were against Bey and he once again disengaged and headed south, back towards Norway, using his ship's superior speed to try and shake off the pursuers. Two of the British cruisers were forced to slow down with engine trouble but at considerable risk to herself, Burnett's flagship Belfast stayed in radar range and was able to report the enemy position to Fraser and his force, who raced to cut the enemy off. Just after 4pm, Duke of York's radar indicated that Scharnhorst was only 45,500 yards (26 miles) away and 50 minutes later Fraser was close enough to open fire. Star shells burst above the battleship flooding the darkness with flat, eerie light. Sitting above the bridge in the steel control tower from where he directed the Scorpion's guns, Tony Ditcham had a grandstand view. 'My first reaction was to think 'what a beautiful ship',' he remembered. The enemy had clearly been taken by surprise because the gun turrets were all facing fore and aft and away from their attackers. Then there was 'a thunderous crash from astern as Duke of York fired a 14in broadside'. He 'watched the ten great shells climb up into the air going away from us'. He was able to track them because the 'driving bands' that imparted spin glowed in the dark 'and made them look like tracer bullets'. Only Scharnhorst remained at large in Northern waters, but even on her own she posed a mighty threat to the convoys, tying up large numbers of ships that could be put to much better use elsewhere. Scharnhorst had to go Then 'suddenly they plunged down towards their target and a huge wall of water rose up, completely concealing Scharnhorst'. The first salvo scored a hit, disabling one of the two big front gun turrets, which was 'not bad shooting at six miles, in pitch dark and the ship never steady'. Bey turned north in a bid to escape but, with Norfolk and Belfast blocking the way, was forced to swing eastwards at maximum knots with the British ships in hot pursuit. Scorpion was with the other destroyers leading the chase. For an hour and half Tony watched 'the amazing sight of two great battleships firing at each other in pitch dark, the German ship turning night into day with the brilliant flashes from her broadsides'. Even with the damage to her turret and radar her shells frequently straddled the Duke and one hit the mast but failed to explode. By early evening it seemed that Fraser's trap had failed and his quarry might escape to fight another day. But then at around 6.30pm, Scharnhorst's hectic pace slackened. One of the Duke's shells, fired at maximum range, hit a boiler room, and despite frantic repair efforts the battleship was now vulnerable to the torpedoes of the destroyers closing on her. Scorpion's captain ordered full speed ahead while the crew prepared to fire her eight one-ton torpedoes broadside at the giant target. Close behind, the Norwegian navy destroyer Stord did the same. The dazzling starshells made it difficult to see the ship but it also meant the Germans were unable to see the attackers. But when Scorpion was only 3,500 yards (two miles) away she was spotted. The Scharnhorst's skipper knew what was coming next and veered sharply away from the expected path of the torpedoes and towards the destroyer, presenting a prime target for Scorpion's four 4.7-inch guns. The German battleship Scharnhorst, seen in Wilhalms Haven, Germany, in 1939 Tony shouted 'shoot!' as the giant hull of the battleship rushed past and the first broadside boomed out. 'In the next ten seconds we fired two more broadsides, and all three hit,' he remembered. 'And then she was gone, just as I was beginning to enjoy myself.' Two of their torpedoes also slammed home. The destroyers Savage and Saumarez braved a hail of fire to launch two more from the other side. Just before the attack, Bey sent a signal back to German naval command: 'We will fight on until the last shell is fired.' He was as good as his word. Thanks to the torpedo damage Scharnhorst was now limping along at ten knots and was soon easy meat for Duke of York, which began a merciless bombardment under the light of the star shells 'hanging like chandeliers' over the dying ship. The end came at 7.45pm. Scharnhorst sank bow first and slid into the depths with propellers still turning. Scorpion slowed to a halt and began searching for survivors. Tony saw scores of them, rising and falling in the heavy sea, their cries whipped away by the wind. Many had already succumbed to the cold and others were 'being killed by these big timbers crashing about' — heavy lumps of wood that all ships carried to block holes torn open by shells. 'We tried like mad to get them in and threw lines out to them,' he said. 'We also dropped landing nets into the water, hung out on brackets to keep them clear of the ship.' Their hands were too frozen and coated in oil to get a grip. The ship was wallowing in the troughs of huge waves churned up by the force eight gale. Risking their lives, Tony and other crewmen scrambled down the nets to haul the numbed and dazed seamen in. They managed to save 30 German lives and another destroyer rescued six more. All the rest of the 1,968 crew drowned or died of exposure, among them Admiral Bey. The clash was named the Battle of North Cape and with the Home Fleet's victory the menace to the Arctic convoys from big enemy ships was ended. For Tony Ditcham it was just one adventure in a wartime career that took him on to the Normandy landings and the Far East, and post-war life as an overseas civil servant in Africa and businessman. Age has barely slowed him and he walks every day in the countryside around the Shropshire farmhouse he shares with his partner Sarah, a living reminder of a certain breed of Englishman whose like we shall not see again.

    "text": "\"Now that the area has been cleaned we are grateful. We will look after it and prevent illegal dumping.\"\nFed-up with rubbish strewn across their neighbourhood, Gugulethu residents rolled up their sleeves to clean illegal dumps on Thursday, Mandela Day.\nCommunity leader Sithembele Ntaba said people decided to clean up because they want to change the image of the township.\nThe clean-up campaign followed pleas to the City of Cape Town to assist the community with cleaning up.\nAfter the clean-up volunteers went door-to-door educating residents about illegal dumping and its consequences. They have vowed to police the area and hold dumpers accountable.\nGroundUp attended the clean-up campaign. The dump sites were filthy and smelly.\nResidents living close to the dumps complained that they cannot open their windows due to the stench. The mounds of rubbish are infested with flies and residents said their children are unable to play outside due to the filth on their doorsteps.\nVolunteers participating in the clean-up said the companies hired by the City of Cape Town were not doing enough, which is why community members decided to take matters into their own hands.\nSome said the companies contracted by the City of Cape Town stopped cleaning several months ago because syndicates were extorting money from them.\nThe City of Cape Town took part in the initiative and provided the residents with refuse bags.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines South Africa Environment Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

He said he appreciated the community initiative.\nTwigg said illegal dumping was a problem not only in Gugulethu, but across Cape Town.\nNcumisa Sopangisa, principal of Intshinga Primary School in Gugulethu, said she was grateful the clean-up campaign had cleared a dumping site close to her school. Some of the school's learners took part in the cleanup.\n\"The illegal dumping site next to the school was an eyesore and a bad example for the children. The waste is a threat to their health. We will take it upon ourselves to educate the children that illegal dumping is a problem and should be stopped,\" said Sopangisa.\nResident Masithembe Mkosi said dumping had been ongoing for years. \"Now that the area has been cleaned we are grateful.

    "text": "The Met Office confirmed the worst of the conditions passed. Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "Pas de sapin gigantesque, pas de crèche flamboyante, peu de joie. Un voile de tristesse enveloppe dimanche [Bethléem, qui se pare habituellement de ses habits de fête à l’occasion de Noël, terni cette année par la guerre dans la bande de Gaza](https://www.rtbf.be/article/cinq-choses-a-savoir-sur-bethleem-berceau-du-christianisme-9488156). Peu de fidèles et de touristes sont attendus au cours de la journée et à la messe de minuit dans la ville palestinienne en Cisjordanie occupée, qui selon la tradition chrétienne, a vu naître Jésus-Christ. Les touristes ont fui la région depuis le début de la guerre entre Israël et le Hamas le 7 octobre. Les chrétiens palestiniens n’ont, eux, pas le cœur aux célébrations, largement annulées par la municipalité, ne pouvant faire fi du sort de leurs concitoyens, assiégés et bombardés à Gaza. \"Ils sont nombreux à mourir pour cette terre, c’est très difficile de célébrer quelque chose alors que notre peuple se meurt\", estime Nicole Najjar, étudiante de 18 ans, sur la place de la Mangeoire désertée. Face à la basilique de la Nativité, une œuvre d’art évoquant le drame de Gaza a été installée à terre, en lieu et place de la crèche grandeur nature et du colossal sapin : Marie et Joseph, statues grises, au milieu d’un fatras de débris et de tôle, derrière des barbelés. Sur l’immeuble d’à côté, une grande banderole : \"Arrêtez le génocide, arrêtez le déplacement, levez le blocus\" ou encore \"Les cloches de Bethléem sonnent pour un cessez-le-feu à Gaza\". Cette année est différente des autres, elle est faite de tristesse, de chagrin, de destruction, de privation et de perte. Mervat Murra, créatrice de mode à Bethléem La guerre entre le Hamas et Israël est entrée dimanche dans sa 79e journée. Déclenchée le 7 octobre par l’attaque de commandos du Hamas, mouvement reconnu comme terroriste par l’Union européenne. L’attaque a fait environ 1140 morts d’après les autorités israéliennes et la riposte israélienne a fait plus de 20.400 morts à Gaza et déplacé 85% de la population, selon le gouvernement du Hamas. Dans le territoire palestinien, gouverné par le Hamas, des chrétiens, dont le nombre est estimé à un petit millier, ont pris refuge dans des églises qui n’ont pas été épargnées par les combats. La semaine dernière, une mère et sa fille ont été tuées par des tirs israéliens dans l’enceinte de l’église de la Sainte-Famille dans la ville de Gaza, selon le patriarcat. Le pape François a dénoncé des bombardements et des tirs ciblant \"des civils sans défense\". \"Cette année est différente des autres, elle est faite de tristesse, de chagrin, de destruction, de privation et de perte\", se désole Mervat Murra, 50 ans, créatrice de mode à Bethléem. La parade de scouts, qui réveille habituellement la ville à coups de cornemuses et tambourins, doit laisser place à un défilé silencieux.",

    "title": "Henri Got, hydrogeologist: \"In the Pyrénées-Orientales, the water situation will be worse in 2024 than in 2023\" - The Limited Times",
    "text": "General mobilization! On 6 December, the economic forces of the Occitanie region (three consular chambers with the support of the regional council) declared a general mobilisation to win the battle for water, which has become scarce and precious in some departments. During a four-hour colloquium, one hundred actors in the case, gathered on the stage of the Narbonne theatre, captivated more than 700 people, sweeping all imaginable avenues to save water, transport it, store it.\nAt the end of the collective awareness exercise, punctuated by good intentions, the visionary winemaker Gérard Bertrand urged to act quickly with a steering committee supported in this desire to accelerate by his rugby friend Didier Codorniou, vice-president of the Region. Because, from now on, time is running out for some territories, such as the Pyrénées-Orientales, where it still did not rain at the end of December. No sooner had the participants of the symposium returned home than the bad weather news arrived. The publication by BRGM of the latest assessment of phreatic reserves has immediately sent the Catalan department back into the nightmare of 2023. And this is probably only the beginning, as hydrogeologist Henri Got, former president of the University of Perpignan, explains.\nRead alsoIs it really irresponsible to have your own swimming pool?\nWhere do we stand on the waterfront in the Pyrénées-Orientales?\nThe readings for the Pyrénées-Orientales are not worrying. They are very worrying since on 1 December, the level of recharge of the aquifers was below the lowest level ever. This can be made up for in the water table if it rains a lot. But the so-called Pliocene deep aquifers will not be able to be regenerated. This is worrisome for the future.\nWill we relive in 2024 the stress of the lack of water felt in 2023?\nWe are likely to live worse than 2023. If it doesn't rain a lot between now and March, it will be worse than 2023. And the competition for water use will be much more complicated. Simply because in 2023, we were starting with a normal reserve level, especially for surface water and dam filling. In Villeneuve de la Raho, the reserve is currently at a third of its capacity. It's the same for Vinça (our photo). And, right now, there is no snow. Look at the Canigou. It is not white. Normally, groundwater recharge occurs in the fall. However, the charging has not begun. In the best-case scenario, half of the groundwater recharge period has been missed. There is a deficit in both groundwater and surface water. Thus, in some areas, the Agly is still dry, as it was last May.\nHenri Got, hydrogeologist.\nTo save the Pyrénées-Orientales, will we be able to count on the transfer of water from the Rhône via the BRL canal and AquaDomitia?\nThe diameter of the Aqua Domitia pipe to transport water from the Rhône has been calculated to serve the east of the Aude department. I am not sure that we can serve the Pyrénées-Orientales with the transport capacity of the current pipe. And it will take a lot of work to extend this service. In the best-case scenario, this will take a long time. And money.\nIs reusing water a good idea?\nYes, but with its limitations. You can only reuse water that you have already consumed. And let me remind you that water from wastewater treatment plants is useful for maintaining the flow of rivers. Thus, Perpignan discharges 17,000 m3 of water per day into the bed of the Têt River. Without this water, the Tet River would have a ridiculously low flow. The only real solutions to reuse water are coastal stations, which discharge directly into the sea. For water, there is no single solution but several solutions that must be added. It is also possible to create hill reservoirs, but only if it rains. I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all solution for the entire regional territory. Because the situation is very different from one department to another. And the Pyrénées-Orientales are the most exposed. « ;;;",
