    "title": "War rages in Gaza, dimming Christmas lights in Bethlehem - Breitbart",
    "text": "Israel on Sunday pressed on with its war on Hamas in Gaza, shifting focus to the besieged territory’s south as a spiralling death toll has thrown a pall of gloom over Bethlehem on Christmas Eve. US President Joe Biden stressed the “critical need” to protect civilians, in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Israel would “continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved”, according to official statements. As heavy fighting raged on, the Israeli army said it had struck another 200 targets in the past 24 hours in the narrow Palestinian territory, where it is seeking to defeat Hamas and free hostages. The army said 153 troops had died in Gaza since it launched its ground invasion on October 27. Ten soldiers were killed in battles on Saturday, one of the deadliest days for the Israeli side. “This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,” said Netanyahu on Sunday. “The war is exacting a very heavy price… but we have no choice but to keep fighting.” The army said soldiers had raided a northern Gaza compound near schools, a mosque and a clinic and found “explosive belts adapted for children, dozens of mortar shells, hundreds of grenades and intelligence documents”. Hamas rejected the Israeli claims, saying they are meant “to justify their massacring of innocent civilians and their destructive aggression”. The bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 and its Islamist militants killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. The gunmen also seized around 250 hostages, 129 of whom are believed to remain in Gaza following the exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners during a week-long truce last month. Israel’s withering military campaign, including massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry. Vast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks. Eighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many fleeing south and now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents. Near the far southern Gaza city of Rafah, Umm Amir Abu al-Awf, 27, suffered wounds to her hand and legs in a strike on her house early Sunday. “Who won?” she said. “Nothing has been achieved except killing civilians… They keep saying Rafah is safe. It is not safe. Nowhere is safe. Every house has a martyr and injured.” ‘More hatred, less peace’ Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining control in northern Gaza and that now “we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza”. Fighting has raged in the main southern city of Khan Yunis, the birthplace of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza and the man Israel holds most responsible for the October 7 attack. Elsewhere, Palestinian rescuers scrambled again to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble of a destroyed residential building, after a strike hit in the central city of Deir al-Balah. “I was praying when a huge explosion occurred,” said Yazan Moqbel, a wounded man whose sister was still under the broken concrete. “Rubble fell on us. I didn’t know what happened.” The head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war. “For aid to reach people in need, hostages to be released, more displacement to be avoided and above all stop the appalling loss of lives, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.” And World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus similarly renewed calls for a ceasefire, saying: “The decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.” On Friday, the United States allowed the passage of a UN Security Council resolution that effectively called on Israel to allow “immediate, safe and unhindered” deliveries of life-saving aid to Gaza “at scale”. World powers had wrangled for days over the wording and, at Washington’s insistence, toned down some provisions — including removing a call for a ceasefire. Separately, a leading member of Islamic Jihad — which has been fighting alongside Hamas — said the group’s chief Ziad Nakhaleh arrived in Cairo for talks on a truce and hostage exchange, after the Hamas chief visited last week. Muted holiday As the war rages on, Christians around the world celebrate Christmas Eve, and festivities are usually held in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem where they believe Jesus was born. But this year the city is almost deserted, with few worshippers around and no Christmas tree erected, after church leaders decided to forego “any unnecessarily festive” celebrations, in solidarity with Gazans. The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, arrived Sunday at the Church of the Nativity, clad in the traditional black and white keffiyeh. “Our heart goes to Gaza, to all people in Gaza but a special attention to our Christian community in Gaza who is suffering,” he said. “We are here to pray and to ask not only for a ceasefire, a ceasefire is not enough, we have to stop these hostilities and to turn the page because violence generates only violence.” Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope Christmas would mark “a cessation of the Israeli war against the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as across the occupied Palestinian territories”. The Gaza war has heightened tensions across the Middle East. Cross-border fire has erupted almost daily between Israel and Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah movement. And Yemen’s Huthi rebels have fired at cargo vessels in the Red Sea, leading the United States to build a naval taskforce to deter the missile and drone strikes. The US military said four drones had targeted the USS Laboon, but had been shot down, and that an Indian-flagged tanker was hit and sent out a distress call. Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, denied the Islamic republic was orchestrating the campaign, saying the Huthis act on their “own decisions and capabilities”. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, in an interview published Sunday, branded Iran “a thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world”. burs-jd/jsa/ami",

When asked whether the Ukrainian Defence Forces use robotic platforms in combat, Yabchanka said: \"There are systems that could even be seen in Russian social media, some platforms have already been spotted by the enemy and, obviously, if they have been spotted by the enemy, they are already in use.\" The company commander calls for keeping up with modern technologies and implementing them as quickly as possible during this war. \"We have to realise that we are doomed to run ahead of the enemy in terms of technology if we want to win this war, and we obviously do. There are smart developers, there are brave units that are ready to implement these developments. So there is something to work with, we just need to scale up this experience as much as possible, in other words, to have more units like ours. We encourage them, we invite combat units to send representatives, we will teach you everything we know, we are constantly communicating with those combat units that use it, we share our experience. You know, the more effective the networking is, the sooner we will make this military technological revolution,\" Yabchanka concluded. - The Brave1 Defence Technology Cluster has allocated $3 million for defence innovations. Deputy PM and Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov said that the grants will be allocated for UAVs, robotic platforms and electronic warfare systems.

    "text": "UTPB student given free hearing aids ODESSA, Texas (KOSA) - Elijah Givens is taking classes at UT Permian Basin and is hard of hearing. It has been years since he‘s had hearing aids, but he’d learned to navigate the world without them. School was still hard for him. One of his professors noticed Givens struggling to keep up with assignments and reached out to other UTPB staff about what help they could provide to Givens. Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Student Emergency and Disability Services, Amber Lucero, got involved. She learned about Givens' condition and his education. “[Amber] told us that Elijah was having some trouble in class and was struggling to hear his teachers,” said Sandy Stowe, Hearing Instrument Specialist at Beltone. With her help, Givens received a pair of hearing aids, for free from Beltone. “After coordinating with Sandy with Beltone, they were able to actually gift the student with a brand new pair of top of the line hearing aids for him,” Lucero said. Givens said he is happy he can now hear his professors better. “It’s been a blessing,” Lucero said. Givens is working towards a Bachelors of Arts degree. “I was glad to call Beltone to see if they would be willing to donate some hearing aids to help this young man. We are fitting him with some new hearing aids,” Stowe said. Copyright 2024 KOSA. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "La Scuola Holden ha un problema di storytelling?",
    "text": "Qualche giorno fa un’ex studentessa della Scuola Holden ha raccontato nella sua newsletter (e poi in un post Instagram molto condiviso nell’ambiente editoriale) la sua esperienza presso la prestigiosa scuola di scrittura creativa fondata da Alessandro Baricco e quattro suoi amici nel 1994, da lei frequentata dal 2018 al 2021. Il tono della testimonianza è negativo, come si evince dal titolo, “La scuola Holden e la filiera della creatività a pagamento”. Kants Exhibition (questo lo pseudonimo dell’autrice), si dichiara finalmente pronta a parlare della sua pessima esperienza, cosa che finora aveva evitato di fare per paura di «ritorsioni, chiusure, porte sbattute in faccia in un settore dove le porte sono già pochissime e spesso aperte solo a chi ha la chiave giusta».\nL’autrice descrive la Scuola Holden come «un piccolo ecosistema autosufficiente» e «un’azienda privata con sede a Torino che propone corsi di storytelling, qualunque cosa questo significhi. Già, perché la parola “storytelling” viene ripetuta ovunque ma nessuno sembra davvero sapere cosa sia, né cosa voglia dire “insegnarlo”». La scuola propone una ricca varietà di corsi, sia online che in presenza, adatti a tutte le età e le esigenze, ma «la punta dell’iceberg», ci spiega l’autrice, «resta “Original”, il biennio da 20.000 euro (10.000 all’anno), che non rilascia alcun titolo legalmente riconosciuto. Solo un attestato di frequenza. Il suo valore nel mondo culturale? Dipende . Per alcuni è uno status symbol, per altri un deterrente. Può aiutarti ad entrare in certi ambienti, ma può anche farti scartare a priori, perché sì, la Holden è anche un pregiudizio».\nL’ex studentessa ricorda anche che fino a qualche tempo fa, sul sito ufficiale – nella sezione FAQ – alla domanda “Perché costa così tanto?”, la risposta era più o meno questa: «Il nostro prezzo è competitivo a livello mondiale. Un corso simile, alla Columbia ad esempio, costa almeno 100.000 dollari». Quella della Columbia, però, è una laurea: c’è da sottolineare, e l’autrice lo fa, che dal 2020 la Scuola Holden ha ottenuto l’accreditamento del MIUR, riuscendo a lanciare una triennale equipollente a Lettere Moderne o Scienze Umanistiche. Nonostante questo, scrive Kants Exhibition, studiando alla Holden non si è mai studenti, ma clienti.\nTutto quello che non va, secondo l’ex studentessa Alcuni dei problemi della scuola, secondo lei: i test d’ingresso poco selettivi, le nebbiose figure del mentore e dei coordinatori, la mancanza di voti o criteri oggettivi nella valutazione. Segue un approfondimento sul contratto «dal tono ben lontano da quello accogliente delle email motivazionali» ma «redatto in legalese scolastico-corporativo» (beh, viene da dire, è un contratto!) e le relative clausole, tra cui la cessione automatica alla scuola del diritto di utilizzare qualsiasi cosa prodotta durante il corso. L’autrice prosegue lamentandosi del clima competitivo, fomentato, secondo lei, proprio dalla vaghezza e dall’arbitrarietà delle valutazioni sul proprio andamento scolastico: una scuola senza voti o esami in cui «l’unico modo per capire se stavi “andando bene” era guardare quanto eri cercato, invitato, inserito, ammirato» e «l’unico metro di giudizio diventavano gli altri».\nUna competizione, scrive, «non esplicita, ma onnipresente. Nessuno te lo diceva apertamente, ma lo sentivi addosso. Come l’umidità a luglio». Un luogo in cui «i compagni, i mentori, i tutor, gli ospiti ti valutavano sulla base di impressioni, chiacchiere, carisma. E tu facevi lo stesso». Prima di concludere la sua testimonianza, l’ex studentessa racconta della mancanza di sostegno avuta durante un momento difficile (ricovero ospedaliero durante il Covid) avvenuto mentre lavorava a un podcast narrativo da presentare al fatidico Opening Doors (il grande evento finale in cui gli studenti presentano un loro progetto davanti a produttori, editori o aziende). «Alla richiesta di supporto», scrive, «venivo ignorata o respinta con tono passivo-aggressivo. Alla richiesta di confronto, venivo trattata come un problema. Al tentativo di esprimere il mio disagio, veniva risposto che “nessuno è pagato per fare da balia”». L’ex studentessa dice di aver ricevuto da uno dei suoi coordinatori diverse mail con «risposte tranchant, battute a sfondo personale, negazioni di confronto, giudizi espliciti sulla mia condizione psichica» e di averle allegate in una mail scritta alla direzione per lamentarsi della situazione.\nLa direttrice ha risposto riversando elegantemente su di lei la responsabilità dell’accaduto : «Se la tua situazione ti ha reso difficile approfittare delle varie occasioni […] hai avuto e hai da parte nostra la massima comprensione». L’ultima parte è dedicata all’annosa questione del lavoro: la Scuola Holden facilita l’ingresso nel mondo del lavoro? In certi casi, ammette l’autrice, sì, perché alcuni ex studenti che conosce hanno poi effettivamente trovato lavoro. Ma, specifica, quelli che fanno «sono lavori che – detta fuori dai denti – avrebbero potuto ottenere anche laureandosi in un’università pubblica, magari in Scienze della Comunicazione o Lettere, e spendendo decisamente meno. Stage, social media management, redazioni, copywriting base. Insomma: tutte attività raggiungibili anche senza un investimento da 20.000 euro».\nUna risposta che non ha risposto “Risposte che non rispondono” è il titolo che Kants Exhibition ha dato alla parte del suo racconto dedicata alla risposta della direttrice: un’espressione che descrive abbastanza bene il video pubblicato dalla Scuola Holden per “rispondere” alla polemica generata dalla sua testimonianza. Polemica in cui si sono formati due schieramenti abbastanza netti: da una parte chi si è unito a lei nel criticare la scuola e le sue dinamiche “tossiche”, dall’altra chi ha voluto far notare che alcune delle cose da lei descritte (il prezzo dei corsi e il loro funzionamento, ad esempio, o il fatto che i lavori a cui permettono di accedere sono semplicemente quelli disponibili nel settore editoriale) sono da mettere in conto, nel senso che un aspirante studente della Scuola Holden, in teoria, ha tutti gli strumenti per valutare se ha intenzione di accollarsele o meno nel momento in cui decide di iscriversi o non iscriversi.\nC’è anche chi ha osservato come l’ambiente competitivo da lei descritto, in cui viene premiata la capacità del singolo di affabulare e stringere alleanze e rapporti furbi, mostrandosi carismatico, affidabile e autonomo (mentre viene escluso chi è fragile, ammalato, problematico, caotico), si espanda ben al di fuori della Scuola Holden: tristemente, è il modo in cui funziona anche il mondo fuori, soprattutto quando si parla di professioni creative. Invece di approfondire i vari aspetti sollevati dalla testimonianza dell’ex studentessa, rispondere alle sue “accuse” o partecipare in modo costruttivo alla discussione, magari portando prove a supporto del fatto che il diploma facilita l’ingresso nel mondo del lavoro (e di prove ce ne sono tante), la Scuola Holden ha deciso di pubblicare sui suoi profili Instagram e TikTok un breve video (poi eliminato, ma si può ancora trovare in vari stitch su TikTok, ad esempio qui ), in cui si vedono dei genitori sorridenti che rispondono a una sola domanda posta con tono ironico e canzonatorio: «Spesi bene questi 20k?».\nLe risposte sono frasi tipo: «Spesi bene, tutto il sesso che hai fatto qui in questi due anni ne è valsa la pena». Oppure: «Sì ne è valsa la pena, ora mio figlio è felice» e banalità del genere. Un ragazzo interpellato indica un signore poco lontano, presumibilmente suo padre, dicendo: «Li ha spesi lui, non io». Il video è stato accolto molto male e ha ricevuto accuse di classismo e di chiusura per il fatto che non contribuisce in alcun modo alla discussione in corso. Ed è abbastanza singolare che, in questo caso, la Scuola Holden, che dovrebbe avere tutti gli strumenti per produrre una comunicazione efficace, ha avuto qualche problemino con lo storytelling.",
