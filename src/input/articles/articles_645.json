Aquí le enseñamos como hacer un postre para perros saludable y lleno de nutrientes.\nLa alimentación es uno de los pilares fundamentales para que estos animales tengan una vida larga y saludable. Ya no es suficiente darles su comida diaria, si no que debe acompañarla de suplementos y ayudas que lo nutran aún más y le ayuden a fortalecer también su sistema inmunológico. Es por eso que la veterinaria y creadora de contenido ‘sandrasierra.tuvet’ dio la receta de un postre que cumple este cometido.\nPostre para perros Se trata de un manjar verde nutracéutico, contiene espirulina, un superalimento cargado de nutrientes como proteína, clorofila y es demasiado beneficioso para sus perros y gatos. También va a necesitar dos peras, un kiwi, vinagre de manzana y gelatina sin sabor.\nLo primero que debe hacer es triturar las peras para volverlas papilla, luego mezcle un sobre de gelatina sin sabor en una taza. Luego unifica todo los ingredientes en una taza, luego le pone dos cucharadas de espirulina y una cucharada de vinagre de manzana. Después mezcla todo muy bien y lo pone en algunos recipientes en la nevera con los trocitos de kiwi y lo mete a la never hasta que sea una gelatina.\nVer esta publicación en Instagram Una publicación compartida por Sandra Sierra (@sandrasierra.tuvet)\n| Ver también: La lechuga y sus beneficios para los perros; una veterinaria la recomienda",

    "text": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car CINCINNATI ( [WXIX](https://www.fox19.com/2024/06/21/retired-cpd-sergeant-family-rescue-unknown-tri-state-couple-during-florida-vacation/)/Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "title": "‘Miami Vice’ Don Johnson Recalls Being Famous in the ‘80s: ‘We Had Security 24/7’ | The Epoch Times",
    "text": "Actor Don Johnson recalls the overwhelming fame he experienced during his years on “Miami Vice.” [People](https://people.com/don-johnson-80s-heartthrob-was-dangerous-exclusive-8714229), Johnson shared the challenges of his widespread recognition and the measures taken to ensure his protection. “For a long time, I couldn’t even go anywhere,” Johnson said about dealing with his avid “Miami Vice” fans. “I had to isolate. The [women] know where you are. We had security 24/7.” “One day, I reflected on Elvis and thought, ‘Isn’t this kind of the way Elvis lived and died?’ Not that I’m comparing myself to Elvis, but in terms of him not being able to have a personal life. So I learned to manage it and vowed not to let it imprison me,” he said. Johnson rose to stardom in the mid-'80s playing Detective James “Sonny” Crockett on the hit crime drama series “Miami Vice.” While he received acclaim for the role, he was worried for a time that he would be permanently typecast as the Miami detective many have come to love. “My goal then was to not be Sonny Crockett forever,” he said. “I had seen the peril of the actors who were too identifiable with their character. I felt like I had to separate myself from Sonny so people could eventually see me as other characters.” However, he acknowledged the publicity he received from his role. “It’s the 40th anniversary of Miami Vice this year, and hey, I’m still here,” he joked. Johnson is now a father of five–his second-born is actress Dakota Johnson–and appreciates the flexibility he now has with his acting career so he can spend time with his family. “Work-life balance is an interesting thing as an actor because movies eat your life. Television shows eat your life,” he said. “Luckily, I’m at a place where I can pick and choose roles, and sometimes I often prefer the supporting role because I still get joy out of what I do, but I don’t want to work those long hours and be away from my family.” These days, the “Miami Vice” mania Johnson once experienced from fans has subsided, and he is content with where it’s at today. “Fame is a condition,” he said. “But it also goes away.” Johnson recently starred in the Netflix thriller “Rebel Ridge,” released Sept. 5, and is set to star in the Hulu show “Doctor Odyssey” coming out later this month. Johnson’s CareerJohnson was born on Dec. 15, 1949, and spent his earliest days between Flat Creek, Missouri, and Wichita, Kansas. After dropping out of the University of Kansas, he moved to San Francisco and then Los Angeles, where he got his first major role in the stage production “Fortune and Men’s Eyes.” Some of Johnson’s first film appearances include “The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart” (1970), “Zachariah” (1971), “The Harrad Experiment” (1973), and “A Boy and His Dog” (1975). He also had minor roles in TV shows such as “Sarge,” “Kung Fu,” “The Rookies,” and “Nashville 99.” Johnson received his big break in 1984 when he starred as Detective James “Sonny” Crockett in the NBC television cop series “Miami Vice.” The show ran for six seasons until 1990. Johnson’s performance on the show earned him a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy nomination. Later, Johnson starred in the CBS police drama “Nash Bridges” alongside Cheech Marin and Jodi Lyn O’Keefe. The series lasted six seasons from 1996 to 2001. The 74-year-old actor also ventured into music, releasing two pop music albums, 1986’s “Heartbeat” and 1989’s “Let it Roll”. His single “Heartbeat” peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Johnson was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1996.",
