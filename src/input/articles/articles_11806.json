    "text": "On December 20th, after submitting proof of MSB registration completion, Enet Crypto Center Limited (hereinafter referred to as Enet) officially obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license on November 15. This marks a further step in Enet's compliance journey, allowing it to legally conduct currency exchange business in the United States, further expanding its international development space. This establishes a solid foundation for serving global users and enables Enet to provide users with safer, compliant, efficient, and convenient digital economic transaction services Since 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission have repeatedly emphasized that MSBs (Money Services Businesses) include virtual currency exchanges and their managers. The regulated entities are businesses and companies related to financial services. The regulatory scope includes international remittances, foreign exchange, currency trading, ICO issuance, and management of prepaid projects. Operating digital asset-related business within the United States requires a license. Hence, Enet’s possession of the license grants it legal status in the U.S., distinguishing it from other irregular platforms. Enet Exchange has always sought higher-level and broader development. As a global leader in decentralized exchanges, it is committed to breaking national boundaries and achieving global integration. Based on Enet's public blockchain technology, it aims to realize scenario implementations in various fields, including capital, digital asset management, digital asset payment, blockchain charity, blockchain gaming, blockchain entertainment, blockchain shopping, and blockchain community games, thereby creating a complete decentralized digital asset ecosystem. Holding a license is of great significance for current exchanges. Obtaining official permission from the respective countries reflects the strength and credibility of the exchange. For most exchanges, a license also acts as a natural barrier for selection. For users, Enet's compliant operation under regulatory conditions is a major advantage, meaning their investments will receive legal protection. Under official permission, Enet strictly meets local regulatory requirements and user protection regulations. Enet will continue to advance its compliance and globalization development, providing safe and convenient digital asset transaction services to more global users. It also calls on other platforms to join the regular development path, contributing to the industry's progress and hoping to achieve industry compliance consensus.

    "text": "California, United States - April 23, 2025 - Larine Co., a California-based company dedicated to practical dental care innovations, has announced the release of its latest product—LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum. Designed to promote oral health through scientifically supported ingredients, the gum offers a convenient solution for individuals seeking to enhance their dental care habits beyond conventional methods.\nA Modern Take on Dental Care\nFormulated with xylitol and hydroxyapatite, two ingredients backed by dental research, LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum is crafted to support the natural process of remineralization—a key mechanism in maintaining tooth enamel strength. The gum provides an accessible alternative for users aiming to integrate more oral health support into their daily routines.\nEach pack contains 18 pieces and comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. Since its recent market debut, the company reports over 320,000 units sold in five countries, generating an estimated $5 million in total sales.\nScience-Driven Formulation\nXylitol, a plant-derived sweetener, has been shown to help reduce harmful oral bacteria that contribute to cavities. Hydroxyapatite, a calcium-based mineral naturally present in tooth enamel, has gained attention for its role in promoting enamel repair by binding to and reinforcing the tooth surface.\n“These ingredients were selected based on their established benefits in oral health science,” said the company’s spokesperson Matthew DeWitte. “We wanted to create a product that’s both effective and easy to incorporate into everyday life.”\nSupporting Enamel and Gum Health\nIn addition to remineralization, the gum formulation also targets other key areas of oral wellness. Ingredients such as mastic, myrrh, and acacia have been included for their potential to support gum health and freshen breath naturally. The product is especially useful in addressing oral pH balance, helping to shift the mouth to a more alkaline state that favors enamel maintenance.\nNot a Replacement—A Complement\nLarine Co. emphasizes that LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum is intended as a complementary tool and not a replacement for brushing or flossing. It is ideal for individuals looking for an additional layer of dental care in settings where traditional oral hygiene routines may be less accessible.\nTo learn more about LarineCo™ Remineralizing Gum and explore its full ingredient profile, visit https://buylarine.com .\nAbout Larine Co.\nLarine Co. is committed to developing oral health products that merge scientific research with everyday functionality.

    "title": "ANNIV SPL: Arpita Nag of Meraki Cheese shares about her future plans",
    "text": "Cheesemaker and artisanal cheese brand Meraki Cheese’s owner Arpita Nag’s biggest goal for 2024 is to start supplying her artisanal cheeses to the HoReCa industry (hotel/restaurant/café), especially experiential diners like European, Mediterranean, or Italian restaurants, based out of Kolkata. Besides, she has plans to ship most of her cheese across India. So, expansion is mainly what Arpita is looking forward to, this year. We speak with her to know more about it. Excerpts:\nAll these years into business, tell us what excites customers about natural or artisanal cheese?\nOur USP has always been zero-preservative, naturally-made cheese from raw, grass-fed cow milk that\nis certified organic. These features are the biggest crowd-pullers. Even 20 years back, people were not that aware of naturally-made cheese. But now people are more cautious. They read the food labels, ingredients and nutritional facts.\nAs a consumer, if I can pay a little more, I would rather go for natural cheeses even if in lesser quantities. Milk is considered a complete food with vitamins, minerals and protein. Our cheese stand outs from the rest as they do not give your body anything artificial, no preservatives, chemicals, or colours in it. You are just essentially getting the goodness of whole milk, which has been converted into cheese.\nArpita Nag Secondly, cheese is a fermented food. These days, you’ll find so many packaged products, probiotics,\nand prebiotics, which help maintain your gut health. Ultimately, everything is related to what, how and when you eat. The more aged the cheese is, the better it is in terms of consumption because fermentation\ncontinues to happen. And lastly, I think we have long moved away from serving chicken nuggets and fish fingers at a party. Leave aside the fact that you want to make your kids a healthy snack. Even at parties, people are way more open to gifting cheese or serving it to their guests. Since we make a lot of marinated and coated cheeses like pickled feta or marinated chevre, they are appealing to the Indian palate because we are used to having a little spicy food.\nWhat’s the demand like for artisanal cheese?\nDemand is good, but it’s seasonal. Summers are a dull season for us. On the other hand, winters work well and essentially, it’s just four or five months of business that we do. Retail is a little slower in comparison to other metros, to be honest, but it is picking up gradually.\nTAGS Arpita nag Meraki Cheese Cheesemaker Indulge Kolkata anniversary",

    "title": "Pistons tie 76ers for longest overall losing streak at 28 games",
    "text": "BOSTON -- When the [Detroit Pistons](/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons) entered the visiting locker room at halftime of Thursday night's matchup with the [Boston Celtics](/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics), it looked like the Pistons had a chance to not only shock the basketball world but avoid landing in a dubious place in the history books in the process. Detroit, a 16.5-point underdog after losing 27 consecutive games, found itself leading Boston -- the NBA's best team with a perfect 14-0 record at TD Garden -- by 19 points. Then the second half began. And as quickly as Detroit had taken control of the game, Boston surged right back into it. By the end of the third quarter, the Celtics had erased that halftime deficit. And despite the Pistons fighting back valiantly to force overtime, ultimately it was Boston that would claim a [128-122 victory](/nba/game/_/gameId/401585049). With the defeat, the Pistons tied the [76ers](/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers) for the longest overall losing streak, which Philadelphia set across the end of the 2014-15 season and the beginning of the 2015-16 campaign with 28 consecutive losses. The Pistons can set a new record for futility on Saturday, when they face the [Toronto Raptors](/nba/team/_/name/tor/toronto-raptors) back home in Detroit. \"I just told them that it takes a lot of character and integrity to do what they're doing,\" said Pistons coach Monty Williams. \"I've been in the league for a while, and I've seen teams give into circumstances that are less than what we're dealing with. That was admirable; obviously, we had a tough third quarter, and the ability to fight back and have it even in the fourth was tremendous. \"I hurt for them. We feel like we're just getting so close to not just winning one game but winning a lot of games if we play that way.\" For much of the contest, it looked like the 2-29 Pistons would finally get back in the win column. Boston (24-6), back home after winning the final three games of a four-game West Coast swing, appeared to do exactly what Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla warned of before the game: taking its struggling opponent lightly. \"I think just the expectation of it's supposed to go a certain way or it's supposed to be easy,\" Mazzulla said when asked what the challenge was in facing a team in Detroit's position. \"It's just not the case. \"It's another game, regardless of the other team's record. And I think sometimes you get caught up in -- because it's this team, we should be up by this amount at first quarter, halftime -- and it's just not how it works.\" It certainly wasn't how it worked Thursday, as Mazzulla's players went out and promptly looked like a team expecting to sleepwalk its way to a victory. Instead, Boston found itself in a dogfight with Detroit that extended into an extra five minutes after Pistons forward [Bojan Bogdanovic](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3593/bojan-bogdanovic) tied the score with a putback with 4.6 seconds remaining in regulation. Eventually, though, Boston was able to pull away in overtime, as [Kristaps Porzingis](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102531/kristaps-porzingis) (35 points) and [Jayson Tatum](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum) (31) proved to be too much for Detroit to handle. In so many ways, Detroit did enough to win. The league's worst 3-point shooting team made more treys (13) than Boston (11), which entered the game as the league's most prolific squad from deep. The Pistons had 31 second-chance points and repeatedly fought for extra shots. Detroit got strong performances from [Cade Cunningham](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432166/cade-cunningham) (31 points, 6 rebounds and 9 assists) and [Jaden Ivey](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433218/jaden-ivey) (22 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists, before fouling out in overtime). But it wound up being not quite enough to either break Boston's undefeated start to the season at home or stop Detroit's seemingly never-ending losing streak. \"I'm not interested in just winning one more game this year, to stop this. That would be soft, in my opinion. I think our goals are a lot higher than that. We have what it takes to win a game. That's nothing. But to put games together and to find our system, find what's clicking and allow us to sustain winning ... that's what we're looking for right now.\"Cade Cunningham Nevertheless, Williams lauded his team's effort. \"With everything that this team was been through ... they bring a spirit and integrity and toughness to the gym every single day,\" he said. \"They hear everything that people have to say about them and us because they're on social media. It doesn't sway them from doing their jobs but also playing to the level and standard that we talk about every day. \"We can't do anything about the noise; we can control how we approach our jobs. And as bad as they hurt right now, I hurt for them. But I told them if we bring that kind of grit and toughness and execution, minus the turnovers, we're not just going to win one game, we're going to put something together. It doesn't matter what people say, we don't have to shut people up. We just have to continue to get better and grind and produce or put something on the floor that's productive that our fans can be happy about.\" After the Pistons led by as many as 21 points in the first half, Boston outscored Detroit 35-16 in the third quarter to storm back, tying the score going into the fourth quarter. Yet even after coughing up that lead, Detroit showed an impressive level of fight. The Pistons responded to Boston taking the lead to begin the fourth by pushing themselves back out in front by as many as four points on multiple occasions -- the latest being when Ivey split a pair of free throws with 4:23 remaining. Boston, however, immediately responded with back-to-back buckets by Porzingis to retake the lead, before a Tatum layup and a Porzingis 3-pointer pushed Boston's advantage to 106-100. Ivey then scored six straight points -- first on an and-1 then on a corner 3 -- to tie it back up with 1:02 to play. Bogdanovic then missed a wide-open 3 with 36 seconds left that would've given Detroit the lead, and Tatum was credited a layup with 8.7 seconds to go when Cunningham was called for goaltending. Still, that left the Pistons with one more chance to tie or win. But when Cunningham's 3-pointer missed short, Bogdanovic was there to make a putback for the tie. After Tatum missed a potential winner at the other end, the contest went to overtime. And from there, Boston did just enough to survive -- and send Detroit home with yet another defeat. But after the Pistons had a fifth straight competitive loss -- and, in this case, went to overtime with the league's top team -- Cunningham and the Pistons believe a breakthrough might finally be around the corner. \"That's what we're going for, man,\" Cunningham said. \"I'm not interested in just winning one more game this year, to stop this. That would be soft, in my opinion. I think our goals are a lot higher than that. We have what it takes to win a game. That's nothing. But to put games together and to find our system, find what's clicking and allow us to sustain winning ... that's what we're looking for right now.\"",
