Marco Baroni è ovviamente soddisfatto nel post-partita.\nLa Lazio in Europa è una certezza: in casa\ncontro la Real Sociedad arriva un 3-1 perentorioche significa sesta vittoria su sette partite in Europa League (l'altro è un pareggio) eprimo posto nella competizione confermato, con una sola giornata da giocare.Tutto facile all'Olimpico con Gila a sbloccare il risultato e Zaccagni e Castellanos a renderlo più rotondo già nella prima parte di gara, grazie anche a un cartellino rosso collezionato dalla squadra avversaria. Marco Baroni è ovviamente soddisfatto nel post-partita.\"Non vorrei che passasse per normale il percorso che stiamo facendo. Sono contento, la squadra mi stimola continuamente. Non abbiamo fatto niente, c'è ancora tanta strada e lavoro. Ma so di contare su dei ragazzi che hanno fame e che hanno voglia di migliorarsi. Arrivare in fondo all'Europa League? Più che dirlo bisogna farlo. Non bisogna mai dare per scontato niente. Il giocatore deve essere il primo a pretendere di più da sé stesso. Quando pensi di aver acquisito qualcosa è il momento in cui la perdi. Tavares? Non dovrebbe essere niente di importante. Sembra si sia fermato al momento giusto, ma rimane un giocatore importante per noi. Domani verificheremo\".\nZaccagni: \"In pochi si aspettavano un percorso del genere\"\n\"Abbiamo fatto un cammino europeo importante affrontando tutte le partite con un livello alto. In pochi se lo aspettavano, noi ci credevamo. Partita dopo partita sono arrivate tante vittorie. Baroni quest'anno ci ha dato questa mentalità. Qualsiasi competizione affrontiamo dobbiamo affrontarla allo stesso modo. Ho preso tanta fiducia in me stesso e mi ha aiutato molto. Il mister prima della partita ci aveva detto che una vittoria oggi ci aiutava a preparare la partita contro la Fiorentina. Affronti le partite in modo diverso.Siamo entrati in campo con la fame e la voglia di vincere\".\nPiù di 3 milioni di utenti stanno già utilizzando l'app\nScaricala\nScannerizzala\nCondividi questo articolo\nContenuti correlati",

For example, if somebody requests that a doctor cut off a perfectly healthy arm, it would be unethical for the doctor to comply, because the request itself demonstrates insanity, and an insane person cannot give adult consent.\nIn the exact same way, the request for a sex change operation is inherently insane, and so it's unethical to comply with that request, even if the requester is an adult.\nThis is less a freedom issue and more an issue about the bounds of mental illness. Woke tools do not believe that 'transgenderism' is mental illness, but we know better.\nPage\n1\n2\nTop\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBack to Forum\nPost New Thread\nReply\nView Favorites\nDisclaimer / Copyright Info\n-\nPrivacy Policy\n-\nTerms Of Use\n-\nCancellation Policy / Billing Help\nMail\nWebmaster\nwith questions or comments about this site.\nCopyright © 1999 - 2023 Godlikeproductions.com\nPage generated in 0.047s (8 queries)",

    "title": "Further Trump Trial Delay Looms As Supreme Court Weighs Immunity Claim",
    "text": "The US Supreme Court appeared skeptical on Thursday of Donald Trump's claim that a former president is \"absolutely immune\" from criminal prosecution but looked set to issue a ruling that could further delay his election subversion trial.The historic case -- the last in the court's current term -- has far-reaching implications for executive power and the 77-year-old Trump's multiple legal entanglements as he seeks the White House again.\"We're writing a rule for the ages,\" said Neil Gorsuch, one of three conservative justices appointed to the nation's highest court by the former Republican president.By even agreeing to hear the case, the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, already significantly delayed the start of Trump's trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Joe Biden.Special Counsel Jack Smith filed charges against Trump in August and had pushed for a March trial start date but lawyers for the former president responded with a blizzard of motions seeking its postponement, including the \"absolute immunity\" claim.Speaking to reporters before entering a Manhattan courtroom for his separate hush money criminal trial, Trump complained that the judge presiding over the New York case did not allow him to personally attend the Supreme Court hearing.\"I would have loved to have been there,\" the Republican presidential candidate said, adding that without immunity \"you're going to become a ceremonial president.\"A majority of the justices on the Supreme Court, which is expected to issue its ruling by the end of June, did not appear inclined to endorse Trump's claim that as a former president he enjoys blanket immunity from criminal prosecution.But at least four, and possibly five, of the conservative justices did appear to favor some form of presidential immunity for what may be considered \"official acts.\"Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, said he had \"concerns\" with a lower court ruling on the immunity question that paved the way for Trump's prosecution.\"As I read it, it says simply, 'a former president can be prosecuted because he's being prosecuted,'\" Roberts said. \"Why shouldn't we either send (the case) back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?\"Sending the case back to the lower court for further review would almost certainly delay Trump's election conspiracy trial until after the November vote, when he is expected to face Biden once again.Justice Samuel Alito, an archconservative, asked why -- without immunity -- presidents won't just pardon themselves before leaving office \"from anything that they might have been conceivably charged with committing?\"Justice Clarence Thomas, another staunch conservative, asked Michael Dreeben, representing the special counsel, why there had not been any previous prosecutions of a former president.\"The reason why there have not been prior criminal prosecutions is that there were not crimes,\" Dreeben said.He said granting \"absolute immunity\" would \"immunize\" former presidents from criminal liability for \"bribery, treason, sedition, murder\" and -- in Trump's case -- \"for conspiring to use fraud to overturn the results of an election and perpetuate himself in power.\"John Sauer, representing Trump, told the court that \"without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution there can be no presidency as we know it.\"\"Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office,\" Sauer said, while conceding that an ex-president could potentially be prosecuted for what may be determined to be \"private acts.\"The three liberals on the court -- Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson -- pushed back hard against the notion of blanket presidential immunity.\"Wouldn't there be a significant risk that future presidents would be emboldened to commit crimes with abandon?\" Jackson said.Kagan asked whether a president who \"sells nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary\" should be immune from prosecution.\"How about if a president orders the military to stage a coup?\"Sauer said those hypotheticals \"sound very bad\" but argued that \"if it's an official act, there needs to be impeachment and conviction\" by Congress before a president could be criminally prosecuted.In addition to the New York case, in which Trump is accused of paying hush money to a porn star, he faces 2020 election conspiracy charges in Washington and Georgia.He also has been indicted in Florida for allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.© Copyright AFP 2023.

    "title": "Na Europa, vice-presidente dos EUA critica prisão de cristão por orar em silêncio",
    "text": "Em seu primeiro discurso no cenário mundial, o vice-presidente dos EUA, JD Vance, fez uma defesa contundente da liberdade de expressão e religiosa, além de abordar uma série de questões geopolíticas na Conferência de Segurança de Munique, realizada na Alemanha.\nA conferência reuniu líderes políticos, militares e especialistas internacionais, tornando-se um palco importante para Vance destacar a relevância dos direitos fundamentais em um cenário global cada vez mais conturbado e polarizado.\nVance iniciou sua fala, que aconteceu na sexta-feira (14), afirmando que a preocupação dos EUA em relação ao continente europeu não vem da China, da Rússia ou de qualquer ator externo, mas sim de uma \"ameaça interna\" à liberdade de expressão na Europa.\nVance acusou Bruxelas de limitar as redes sociais devido a conteúdos considerados odiosos. Ele também atacou a Alemanha, alegando que o país estaria realizando ações contra seus próprios cidadãos por postarem comentários antifeministas. Além disso, criticou a Suécia por condenar uma ativista cristã e o Reino Unido por retroceder em direitos religiosos.\n“Em toda a Europa, temo que a liberdade de expressão esteja em retrocesso”, disse o vice-presidente americano.\nOração silenciosa\nVance mencionou o caso de um cristão no Reino Unido que foi multado por orar silenciosamente perto de uma clínica de aborto.\n“Ele não obstruiu ninguém, não interagiu com ninguém, apenas orou em silêncio. Quando a polícia britânica o abordou e perguntou pelo que ele estava orando, Adam respondeu que era pelo filho não nascido que ele e sua ex-namorada haviam abortado anos antes. Os policiais não se comoveram\", relatou Vance.\n\"Ele foi considerado culpado de violar a nova lei de zonas de exclusão do governo, que criminaliza orações silenciosas e outras ações que possam influenciar a decisão de uma pessoa dentro de 200 metros de uma clínica de aborto\".\nO caso do veterano do exército britânico Adam Smith-Connor, citado por Vance, não é isolado. Muitos outros ativistas pró-vida enfrentam sanções, como multas e até prisões, como aconteceu com Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, uma cristã que foi presa enquanto orava em silêncio perto de uma clínica de aborto, também no Reino Unido.\nAdam Smith-Connor ora em frente ao Tribunal de Poole. (Foto: ADF International)\nA prisão desses ativistas é considerada por muitos como um ataque à liberdade religiosa e à liberdade de expressão, direitos garantidos pelas leis britânicas.\nOs casos levantaram sérias preocupações sobre o crescente cerceamento de manifestações religiosas, mesmo quando realizadas de maneira pacífica e sem perturbar a ordem pública.\nDireitos fundamentais\nAinda em seu discurso na Alemanha, Vance destacou a importância de proteger as liberdades individuais, incluindo a liberdade religiosa, em face de pressões políticas e sociais que buscam silenciar vozes dissidentes.\nCom isso, o debate sobre os direitos fundamentais ganha ainda mais relevância em um cenário global onde a polarização das questões políticas e morais está em ascensão.\nA posição de JD Vance e a crítica aos ataques à liberdade religiosa refletem uma preocupação com a defesa da liberdade de pensamento e expressão, especialmente quando se trata da preservação da fé.\nO vice-presidente dos EUA concluiu seu discurso enfatizando a importância de respeitar os princípios democráticos e os direitos fundamentais dos cidadãos europeus.\nEle salientou que, sem um compromisso verdadeiro com a liberdade de expressão e o respeito às vozes dissidentes, a Europa corre o risco de se afastar ainda mais dos valores ocidentais que a definiram historicamente.\n“Nenhuma democracia – seja ela americana, alemã ou europeia – sobreviverá se disser a milhões de eleitores que seus pensamentos e preocupações, suas aspirações e seus pedidos de alívio são inválidos ou indignos de consideração.”",

    "text": "A cold wave continues to grip Karachi, Hyderabad, and much of Sindh through Thursday night, Friday, and Saturday, as predicted by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Currently, continental air masses dominate most of Pakistan, with a weak westerly wave affecting Gilgit-Baltistan and moving northeast.\nGiven these conditions, we can expect chilly and dry weather in Karachi, Hyderabad, and most areas of Sindh during these days. In Karachi, temperatures are expected to drop to 10-12°C on Friday and 9-11°C on Saturday. Similarly, Hyderabad will experience temperatures from 10-12°C on Friday, dipping to 9-11°C on Saturday.\nOver the past 24 hours, a cold wave has swept through Karachi, Hyderabad, and many other districts in Sindh. Mithi emerged as the coldest spot in Sindh with a temperature of 2°C and an evening relative humidity of 23%. Karachi recorded a minimum temperature of 11°C, with evening humidity at 14%, while Hyderabad saw a low of 12°C with 30% humidity in the evening.\nThe persistent cold weather requires residents to take necessary precautions to stay warm and safe.",

Siria suma uno e India cierra a cero.\nEn la tercera jornada, Australia y Uzbekistán se miden entre sí, en un duelo directo por el liderato de la llave.\nEl otro partido del jueves en la Copa de Asia, dentro del grupo C, midió a Palestina con Emiratos Árabes Unidos y se saldó con un empate 1-1.\nSultan Adil Alamiri adelantó a Emiratos en el 23 y en el 50 un tanto en contra de Bader Nasser permitió a los palestinos igualar. Los emiratíes habían quedado muy dañados con la expulsión en el 37 de Khalifa Al Hammadi, lo que les obligó a jugar con un hombre menos durante una parte sustancial del partido.\nEn la clasificación del grupo C, Emiratos Árabes Unidos lidera con 4 puntos y Palestina es tercera con 1. Irán (2º, 3 puntos) y Hong Kong (4º, 0) se enfrentan el viernes.\nLa selección palestina, que disputa su tercera Copa de Asia, vio su preparación fuertemente perturbada por la guerra en curso en la franja de Gaza entre Israel y Hamás. Algunos jugadores palestinos han perdido a familiares y amigos, y el equipo tuvo que entrenarse y preparar el torneo en el extranjero.\nContinuar leyendo la historia -- Resultados del jueves en la fase de grupos de la Copa de Asia\n- Grupo B:\nIndia - Uzbekistán 0 - 3\nSiria - Australia 0 - 1\nClasificación: Pts J G E P GF GC dif\n1.
