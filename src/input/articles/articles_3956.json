    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel - Barrie News",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

The past week has been just what the doctor ordered providing the Colorado ski resort with over two feet of snow and allowing it to open The Beavers and Pali terrain. A-Basin’s patrol team is working diligently to open more of the mountain as soon as possible, please keep an eye on the resort’s [terrain status ](https://www.arapahoebasin.com/snow-report/#terrainAndLiftStatus)for real-time updates.

Currently 32 out of 144 runs are open and six of the resort’s nine lifts are spinning. On top of great snow, Arapahoe Basin Ski Area has plenty coming up on its events calendar, including the last two Rise n’ Shine Rando Races on [January 23](https://www.arapahoebasin.com/event/rise-n-shine-rando-6/), the famous [Moonlight Dinners](https://www.arapahoebasin.com/event/moonlight-dinner-south-america/), and the [NSAA Safety Village](https://www.arapahoebasin.com/event/new-event-9/) on January 27, just to mention a few events.

    "text": "By Abraham Achirga\nABUJA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent's most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican's declaration will change much.\n\"Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,\" Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the\nimpression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope's decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God's children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n\"There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,\" said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n\"I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,\" she said.\n\"We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\"\n(Reporting by Abraham Achirga Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)\n(( ; Reuters Messaging:\n[macdonald.dzirutwe.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net](rm://macdonald.dzirutwe.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net/)))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

    "text": "Tote bei Fährunglück vor Bali - Dutzende Passagiere vermisst\nVor der Urlaubsinsel Bali ist in der Nacht eine Fähre gesunken. Für mehrere Menschen kam jede Hilfe zu spät, Dutzende werden noch im Meer vermisst. Aber es gibt auch Überlebende.\nDenpasar - Vor der indonesischen Insel Bali ist eine Fähre mit Dutzenden Passagieren an Bord gesunken. Bis zum Morgen (Ortszeit) hätten Einsatzkräfte vier Leichen und 29 Überlebende gefunden, sagte Nanang Sigit, Leiter der Such- und Rettungsagentur der Stadt Surabaya. Mehr als 30 Menschen werden noch vermisst. Die Fähre war auf dem Weg von der Nachbarinsel Java zum Hafen von Gilimanuk an der Westspitze von Bali.\nDas Schiff, die KMP Tunu Pratama Jaya, sei am späten Abend (Ortszeit) aus dem Hafen von Ketapang auf Java ausgelaufen und habe rund 20 Minuten später ein Notsignal gesendet, sagte Wahyu Setiabudi, Koordinator der örtlichen Such- und Rettungsstation. An Bord waren 65 Menschen, darunter 53 Passagiere und 12 Besatzungsmitglieder.\nMehrere der Überlebenden seien im Meer vor Cekik auf Bali gerettet worden. Sie hätten sich auf einem Rettungsfloß in Sicherheit gebracht, teilten die Behörden mit. Im Hafen von Ketapang bangten zahlreiche Angehörige um ihre Lieben und warteten auf Nachrichten. Die Behörden suchten mit zehn Schiffen im Meer und an den Küsten nach Vermissten.\nGefährliche Meerenge mit starker Strömung\nDie Fähre transportierte auch mehr als 80 Fahrzeuge, darunter große Lastwagen und Autos sowie viele Motorräder. Ob auch Touristen betroffen sind, war zunächst unklar - jedoch benutzen generell nur wenige Urlauber diese Fährverbindung.\nDie Überfahrt in der Straße von Bali - einer schmalen, aber oft turbulenten Meerenge, die für starke Strömungen und plötzliche Wetterumschwünge bekannt ist - dauert normalerweise weniger als eine Stunde. Viele Indonesier pendeln zwischen Java und Bali, den beiden verkehrsreichsten und am dichtesten besiedelten Inseln des südostasiatischen Landes.\nLeck im Maschinenraum?\nEin Einsatzteam war gleich nach dem Notsignal zum letzten bekannten Standort des Schiffes entsandt worden, jedoch erschwerten schlechtes Wetter und bis zu 2,5 Meter hohe Wellen die Suche, erklärte Wahyu. Inoffizielle Berichte unter Hafenarbeitern deuten darauf hin, dass das Schiff vor dem Kentern möglicherweise ein Leck im Maschinenraum hatte.\nEin hinterherfahrendes Schiff meldete derweil, dass die Fähre gekentert sei und südwärts treibe. Berichten zufolge soll sie anschließend gesunken sein. Indonesien, ein Staat mit über 17.000 Inseln, ist stark auf den Fährverkehr angewiesen. Sicherheitsstandards werden jedoch oft unzureichend durchgesetzt. Unfälle sind in dem Land keine Seltenheit. dpa",
