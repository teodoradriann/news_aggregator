    "text": "The Princess of Wales is set to turn her attention to the importance of fathers in children's early years. Kate has met a number of fathers' groups amid plans to raise awareness about the role men play at the beginning of youngsters' lives. She has consulted experts in the sector to find out how best to highlight the issue, as well as how to attract more fathers to parenting groups and support their mental health. Research by the princess's Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood found that only 19 per cent of the population could identify the period between pregnancy and the age of five as the most important for shaping a child's future. While one in four women did, this was matched by only 14 per cent of men. The Princess of Wales takes part in a Dad Walk in the local park during a visit to \"Dadvengers\", a community for dads and their children, in Arnos Grove, north London, on November 1 to highlight the important role that fathers play in their children's earliest years Kate has met a number of fathers' groups amid plans to raise awareness about the role men play at the beginning of youngsters' lives. She is pictured on November 1 during a Dad Walk in Arnos Grove, north London Kate's decision to increase her focus on fatherhood follows her visit to Maidenhead Rugby Club in Berkshire in June to speak to men about their experiences as first-time fathers. Rugby star Ugo Monye is among the high-profile figures backing the princess's Shaping Us campaign, which raises awareness of the importance of early childhood. Monye said he had been 'highly impressed by Her Royal Highness and her dedication to a topic which connects so many of us'. Christian Guy, executive director of the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, told the Daily Telegraph: 'There remains a real need to provide information, advice and support to men about what a significant role they can play in the earliest days, weeks and months – and even before the baby is born – which is such an important period developmentally and begins to lay foundations for the rest of their lives.'",

    "text": "Standing for babies\nSupreme Court justices rule against pro-life doctors in mifepristone case\nThe Supreme Court unanimously ruled Thursday morning that pro-life physicians do not have standing to sue the Food and Drug Administration over its regulation of the abortion drug mifepristone.\n“The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to elective abortion and to FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh\nwrote in the majority opinion. “But … the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that FDA’s relaxed regulatory requirements likely would cause them to suffer an injury in fact. For that reason, the federal courts are the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs’ concerns about FDA’s actions.”\nPlanned Parenthood staffer Hope Johnston-Holm stood outside of the court in the first hours after the ruling. She said she was excited to hear of the opinion, telling WORLD the unanimous decision from the conservative-majority court surprised her. “I think this is something that everyone should be able to support no matter what party affiliation you have,” Johnston-Holm said. “There is something about having control over your own body that everyone can get behind.”\nBut, while the court did end the legal challenge\nbrought by pro-life physician groups and individual doctors, the opinion itself had almost nothing to do with the abortion drug. It did not rule on the doctors’ arguments that the FDA was wrong to scrap its safety requirements for the distribution of mifepristone and allow abortion pills to ship by mail-order. Pro-lifers say that leaves the door open for other parties to challenge the legality of the FDA’s loose restrictions on the drug.\n“Abortion advocates are going to claim a great victory for abortion drugs,” Thomas Jipping, senior legal fellow for The Heritage Foundation, said of the ruling. “This has nothing to do with whether abortion drugs are safe. They’re not.”\nHe said the court’s move to reject the standing of the pro-life doctors did not surprise him. “Everyone has known all along that legal standing to try to hold the FDA accountable would be a difficult argument to make. These are pro-life doctors, and so they don’t prescribe mifepristone. So their argument that they may sue over it is a little more complicated.”\nEven the court’s unanimous agreement in the case, he said, points to the fact that the ruling was focused on more technical, procedural matters rather than on arguments at the core of the lawsuit. A ruling on the merits of such a case is less likely to be unanimous.\nAlliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Erin Hawley, who\nargued the case before the Supreme Court in March on behalf of the pro-life doctors, spoke at a news conference following Thursday’s ruling. “The decision based on a legal technicality allows the FDA to continue its reckless disregard for women’s health, at least for now,” she said.\nBut Hawley celebrated that the justices’ ruling was “crystal clear that pro-life doctors do have federal conscience protections, even in emergency situations.” The ruling affirms that physicians do not have to participate in abortions if it goes against their convictions, she said.\nShe also pointed out that the court did not dismiss the lawsuit altogether. Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas\nintervened in the case in the lower courts and will likely continue the legal challenge against the FDA. “Those states remain in the case,” Hawley said. She expects litigation to continue, with the states raising standing arguments different from those made by the pro-life plaintiffs. Hawley said she is hopeful the FDA will eventually have to answer for its lack of safety requirements on the drug.\nSome pro-lifers have in mind other avenues for future legal challenges against the FDA. Michele Hendrickson, director of strategic initiatives at Students for Life of America, held a sign that read “Chemical Abortion Kills” as she stood with other members of the group outside of the court Thursday morning. She said that her organization regularly works with women who have been hurt by chemical abortion, and she’s hopeful that women who have suffered those harms will bring their own challenges against the FDA.\n“As soon as we have more women who we know have been harmed by chemical abortion, who can now come forward and be able to plead that case, I believe that we’ll see more cases like this,” Hendrickson said. “We know women are out there. They just need to be given that voice and that ability.”\n–With reporting from Carolina Lumetta in Washington, D.C.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism,\nclick here.\nI so appreciate the fly-over picture, and the reminder of God’s faithful sovereignty. —Celina\n[Sign up to receive Vitals, WORLD’s free weekly email newsletter on the pro-life movement.](/vitals-signup )",

    "text": "Bluesky is taking off! The social network believed to be X (Twitter’s) direct competitor is getting a huge boost as millions of new users join, including some big names from Hollywood.This shift comes after the US election and in the wake of looming terms of service change on X, as Elon Musk secures a major appointment in Trump's cabinet. While Bluesky’s new growth spurt is exciting, it’s also causing some glitches, with users reporting outages with over 16 million users now on board.Bluesky down, users report outagesOn November 14, Bluesky, the microblogging platform owned by Jay Graber, shot to the top of the App Store rankings, as reported by Business Insider. The platform shared that it welcomed one million new users just this week, and by Wednesday, the total user count had reached 15 million.On Thursday, thousands of users reported issues with the app and website on Downdetector, just when Bluesky surpassed 16 million users, according to a live tracker by Jaz, a Bluesky employee.Also read: Cardi B reveals how much Kamala Harris paid her, swearing on her three kids: ‘You know damn well…’While Musk’s X platform boasts an estimated 317 million users, Bluesky’s user base is still relatively small. However, it is steadily growing as many Hollywood celebrities and users move away from Musk’s platform, especially after Donald Trump secured a second term in the White House.Musk, a major Trump donor and now a key member of the DOGE initiative, has been working with Trump, who has said that DOGE will “pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.”Hollywood elites leave X for BlueskyAmerican television journalist Don Lemon shared that he is leaving Musk-owned X, explaining in a short video posted on Wednesday, “I once believed it was a place for honest debate, discussion, transparency, and free speech. But now, I feel it no longer serves that purpose.”Other notable figures, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Elton John, Mia Farrow, and Whoopi Goldberg, have also decided to part ways with the platform. Rapper Lizzo chimed in, saying, “Anyways, I joined Bluesky because we’re leaving toxicity in 2024.”Also read: Elon Musk to buy McDonald's and CNN as Trump returns? Wild claims surface, here's the truthBluesky was originally created as a research project by Jack Dorsey in 2019 with the goal of decentralizing Twitter, according to Forbes. With many features similar to X, it allows users to create their own servers to store data and set their own rules, instead of relying on company-owned servers. It officially launched as its own company in 2021 and opened to the public in 2023 in a beta version.",

    "text": "Nova York (EUA) – Amplo favorito na partida que encerraria a rodada desta quinta-feira no Arthur Ashe Stadium, Carlos Alcaraz não passou da segunda rodada do US Open. O número 3 do mundo e campeão de 2022 foi surpreendido pelo holandês Botic van de Zandschulp, 74º do ranking, que marcou as parciais de 6/1, 7/5 e 6/4 em 2h19 de partida. Aos 28 anos, Botic tem como melhor ranking da carreira o 22º lugar e nunca conquistou um torneio da ATP. Mas o holandês já fez uma boa campanha no US Open em 2021. A vitória sobre o espanhol em Nova York foi a sétima da carreira contra um top 10 e a primeira na temporada. O adversário de Botic na terceira rodada será o canhoto britânico Jack Draper, 25º do ranking, que superou o argentino Facundo Diaz Acosta por 6/4, 6/2 e 6/2. O confronto entre eles é inédito no circuito profissional. [+ Clique aqui e siga o Canal do TenisBrasil no WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaBO9UjBfxoFDqEysg3G) O resultado também marcou o fim de uma invencibilidade de 15 jogos de Alcaraz em Grand Slam. O espanhol vinha das conquistas de Roland Garros e Wimbledon na atual temporada, mas não foi bem na temporada em quadras duras no verão americano. Há duas semanas, em Cincinnati, perdeu na estreia para Gael Monfils. Além disso, o vencedor de quatro títulos de Grand Slam não perdia tão cedo em um torneio deste nível desde 2021, quando caiu na segunda rodada de Wimbledon. Após o domínio no primeiro set, holandês evitou reação do espanhol Em um primeiro set muito rápido, Botic não enfrentou break-points e cedeu apenas seis pontos em seus games de serviço. O holandês conseguiu uma quebra logo cedo, ampliou a vantagem no fim da parcial, e marcou seis winners contra nenhum de Alcaraz. O espanhol também não venceu nenhum dos pontos disputados na rede e pode lamentar uma chance perdida num game mais longo, quando arriscou uma jogada de efeito e não teve sucesso. O segundo set começou com uma quebra para cada lado e Botic foi ameaçado em seus dois primeiros games de serviço. O possível início de uma reação de Alcaraz foi interrompido por uma sequência de games muito seguros do holandês, que não teria mais o saque ameaçado e voltou a quebrar no fim do set. Já naquele momento, Alcaraz buscava uma inédita virada de dois sets a zero. E com nítida falta de confiança nos golpes, sofreu uma quebra no início do terceiro set. O holandês hesitou na primeira vez que esteve em vantagem e foi quebrado com uma dupla falta. Ainda que o campeão de 2022 chamasse a torcida, que esperava por mais jogo e uma reação do favorito, Botic conseguiu confirmar um game muito importante no saque para fazer 4/4. Na sequência, quebrou o serviço de Alcaraz pela sexta vez na partida. E sacando para o jogo, manteve o game de zero para marcar a maior vitória da carreira.",

    "text": "22/03/2024 - 16:08 O Rio de Janeiro deve enfrentar neste fim de semana chuvas intensas com acumulados superiores a 200 milímetros por dia, um patamar semelhante ao que desencadeou a tragédia vista no Estado em 2011, quando cerca de mil pessoas morreram em deslizamentos na região serrana. As previsões foram divulgadas pelo Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais (Cemaden), que espera grandes volumes de chuva a partir da tarde desta sexta-feira, 22. A maior intensidade é prevista para a madrugada de sexta-feira para sábado, 23, dia apontado como mais crítico, especialmente, na região serrana do Estado. “Episódios de deslizamentos podem ser generalizados. Não podemos descartar, inclusive, episódios mais graves, levando em conta o volume previsto, com corridas de massa ou corrida de detritos”, afirmou o coordenador de operações do Cemaden, Marcelo Seluchi, em coletiva de imprensa. Na região metropolitana e no sul do Estado, o volume de chuva deve seguir a mesma média prevista para a região serrana. Ainda que os maiores riscos estejam concentrados na serra, o norte do Estado e a costa oeste também devem registrar chuvas fortes. As previsões levaram o governador do estado, Cláudio Castro (PL) a decretar ponto facultativo no Rio de Janeiro. “Peço que as pessoas fiquem em casa e não se arrisquem em locais ao ar livre”, disse em comunicado nas redes sociais. O monitoramento de risco do Cemanden está sendo atualizado e divulgado em tempo real nas redes do governo do Estado durante o fim de semana. O Cemaden foi fundado em 2011, quando acumulados de chuva eram semelhantes ao previsto para esse fim de semana. Na ocasião, chuvas fortes atingiram 16 cidades do Rio de Janeiro; Teresópolis, Nova Friburgo e Petrópolis foram as mais afetadas. Ao todo, o número de mortos se aproximou de mil, enquanto cerca de 25 mil ficaram desabrigados. “O que haveria de semelhança em relação a 2011: acumulados de chuvas superiores a 200 milímetros, possivelmente de 300 milímetros. Números também observados em janeiro de 2011?, disse Giovanni Dolif, meteorologista e pesquisador do Cemaden ao canal CNN. Regina Alvalá, coordenadora do Cemaden, explica que as previsões para desastres são baseadas em uma somatória de fatores que possibilitam a avaliação de riscos. “Olhamos, além das previsões de tempo, para as chuvas que já caíram e o solo absorveu em dias pretéritos, mais a chuva que esteja caindo no momento e mais a previsão do tempo”, afirmou. A chuva, segundo o Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet) é consequência da aproximação de uma frente fria que avançou pela Região Sul do País na quinta-feira. “Ao longo da sexta (22) e do sábado (23), a previsão é de que esse sistema atue pelo leste da Região Sudeste causando grandes volumes, podendo levar transtornos à população”, informou o órgão federal em nota.",

    "title": "(Crónica) Portugal vence a Croacia con otro récord goleador de Cristiano Ronaldo - Infobae",
    "text": "La selección portuguesa masculina de fútbol ha ganado este jueves por 2-1 a la de Croacia durante la primera jornada del Grupo A1 en la Liga de Naciones, incluyendo otro récord goleador de Cristiano Ronaldo, mientras que Dinamarca ha vencido por 2-0 a Suiza en el Grupo A4, donde también están los combinados de España y de Serbia. En el Estádio da Luz (Lisboa), Diogo Dalot adelantó pronto a los locales en el marcador. Nuno Mendes pasó el balón a Bruno Fernandes, quien desde el pico izquierdo del área rival metió un pase al desmarque de su compañero entre los centrales; en el punto de penalti, Dalot domó la pelota con la diestra y marcó gracias a un tiro raso con la zurda. Cumplida la media hora, Nuno Mendes centró al corazón del área croata y el veterano Cristiano Ronaldo ganó la espalda de Marin Pongracic, para volear de primeras con el interior de su pie derecho y batir a bocajarro al guardameta Dominik Livakovic. Antes del descanso, Croacia redujo distancias con un remate de Borna Sosa que Dalot desvió hacia su propia portería en su intento de despeje. Sin embargo, Portugal conservó dicho resultado hasta el pitido final y consumó su victoria para que 'CR7' pudiese celebrar los 900 goles que ya ha marcado en toda su carrera profesional. Primeros tres puntos para los pupilos de Roberto Martínez en este ajustado Grupo A1. De hecho, en el otro encuentro, Polonia derrotó 'in extremis' por 2-3 a Escocia. Un zurdazo lejano de Sebastian Szymanski, en el minuto 8, botó en el suelo y tocó en el poste antes de entrar en el arco defendido por Angus Gunn. Luego se anuló un gol a Scott McTominay, por mano previa en su control, y en el 44' el culé Robert Lewandowski hizo de penalti el 0-2. A los 22 segundos de empezar la segunda mitad del partido, Billy Gilmour anotó el 1-2 con un derechazo raso tras un barullo en el área rival. McTominay consiguió el 2-2, en el 76', al rematar por abajo en el área polaca un pase de Anthony Ralston desde la banda derecha. Pero la alegría de Hampden Park se esfumó en el 90+7'. Nicola Zalewski marcó el gol del triunfo de Polonia al transformar un penalti que él había provocado, por una falta de Grant Hanley. Esta buena cosecha puso al conjunto polaco también con tres puntos y en el coliderato de su grupo junto a Portugal. Por otra parte, dentro del Grupo A4, el Parken Stadion fue testigo del 2-0 entre daneses y suizos. La insistencia local obtuvo premio al final, a pesar de que el equipo visitante estaba con un jugador menos en el 50', debido a la roja directa que vio Nico Elvedi por derribar a Kasper Dolberg en un contraataque cuando era el último defensor. El joven Patrick Dorgu, al minuto de haber hecho su debut con la selección absoluta de Dinamarca, aprovechó un pase involuntario de Andreas Skov Olsen para marcar con un derechazo raso dentro del área. Ya con otro expulsado en sus filas, por la doble amarilla que recibió Granit Xhaka, Suiza encajó a la contra el 2-0 de Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. Liderato de grupo para la selección danesa con estos tres primeros puntos, mientras que España y Serbia suman solo un punto a raíz de su igualada a cero en el Estadio Rajko Mitic de Belgrado. En la jornada 2, la 'Roja' acudirá a Ginebra para enfrentarse al combinado helvético. Mientras, en la División C, un doblete del exjugador 'txuri-urdin' Alexander Isak guio la victoria de Suecia por 1-3 contra Azerbaiyán. Además, Eslovaquia venció en su visita a Estonia por 0-1, gracias a un gol de Tomas Suslov mediada la segunda parte del encuentro. Así, suecos y eslovacos colideran ese Grupo C1 con tres puntos cada uno. El Grupo C3 también arrancó este jueves, con triunfo y liderato para Irlanda del Norte después de su 2-0 ante Luxemburgo con dianas de Paddy McNair (11') y de Daniel Ballard (17'). En el otro duelo, Bielorrusia y Bulgaria empataron sin goles en la ciudad de Zalaegerszeg (Hungría). Por último, en la División D, el combinado de San Marino se impuso por 1-0 al de Liechtenstein gracias a un tanto de Nicko Sensoli en el minuto 53. Eso valió a los sanmarinenses para sumar tres puntos y situarse de manera provisional en la cúspide del Grupo D1.",
