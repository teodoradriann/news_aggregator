    "text": "Vancouver police have issued a public warning about a convicted killer and high-risk sex offender who will be living in the city. Scott Mackay, 61, “poses a significant risk to women in the community, including sex workers,” police said in a Thursday media release. Mackay is currently on day parole while serving a life sentence for convictions of sexual assault, forcible confinement and second-degree murder. Mackay was convicted of murdering University of Victoria student Marguerite Telesford in 1987. Her body was never found. He’s also a person of interest in another unsolved homicide, and has been convicted of two attacks on sex workers. He was granted six months of day parole last month, following six unsuccessful applications, despite the Parole Board of Canada finding he had a high risk for “violent reoffending.” His parole comes with multiple conditions, including a ban on possessing or consuming alcohol or drugs. [top news stories from Canada and around the world.](javascript:void(0)) He’s also banned from possessing or accessing pornography and sexually explicit material and being in the presence of sex workers. Mackay is bound by a 10 p.m. curfew and must report all contact with females to his parole supervisor. He’s also not allowed to own or operate a vehicle, except in emergency situations approved by his parole supervisor. Mackay is described as five-feet 10-inches tall with short grey hair and hazel e yes. Anyone who sees him breaking his conditions is asked to call 911 immediately.",

    "text": "Someone sent this:\n“Lizzie Harding Weinstein was just found dead in a hotel room. Now there’s an investigation. It’s suspicious. The courts took her kids, her freedom, her driving license. All her money. She was wealthy and they put her under guardianship….”\nElizabeth “Lizzie” Harding Weinstein, a former nurse, mother of three, and ex-wife of a prominent New York attorney, died at 53 in Danbury, CT, in a hotel room.\nHer death ends a five-year battle with her husband.\nThey were raising three teenage children, ages 17, nearly 16, and 13, in Westchester County. She was a former nurse, and at the time the fight began, a stay-at-home mother.\nHer husband, Brian Stryker Weinstein, was a senior litigation partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell. His clients included Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, BT Group, and E*Trade. He sat on the board of the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University.\nOn May 20, 2020, Lizzie said she made a “discovery.”\nShe told him to leave the house. He did.\nShe texted him after he drove away.\n“We have all acknowledged that you have been indoctrinated into the practice of pedophilia.”\nHe was a lawyer. He replied, “I want the indoctrination of pedophilia to stop.”\nWas this an admission? Or a clumsy, placating reply to a woman coming undone?\nIn context, it’s clear: he was not agreeing with her. He was trying to deescalate.\nAt the time of the split, the couple’s three children were teenagers—old enough to have memories, perceptions, and opinions. There is no record that any of the children ever affirmed their mother’s story.\nBrian was out of the house. The children were with her.\nHe did what he knew: he used the courts.\nHe filed an emergency custody petition, 150 pages long, claiming Lizzie was suffering from untreated mental disorder and submitted evidence of disturbing instability.\nOn June 5, 2020—Judge Arlene Katz issued an ex parte Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Harding. The order barred her from contacting her husband, her three children, or living at the family residence.\nPolice removed her from the home. Weinstein moved back in with full physical custody of his children and exclusive control of the home.\nThe TRO was issued without Harding’s presence or input.\nThe following day, June 6, Harding filed for divorce. She alleged the children had been subjected to sexual abuse and the reason why they did not remember being abused by her husband was repressed memory.\nOn December 4, 2020, Judge Nancy Quinn-Koba signed a second ex parte temporary restraining order against Elizabeth Harding, prohibiting contact with her children and access to the family home.\nWhile shut out at court, Lizzie told her story online. She posted frequently on Facebook, accusing Weinstein of abuse, and coordinated legal and psychiatric sabotage. She claimed the reason the teenage children did not support her pedophilia accusations is that her husband had brainwashed them.\nHer public accusations had the potential to destroy her husband’s career, which would also financially impact her children. Lizzie did not work. Her posts named her husband, his parents, and a broad group of alleged enablers of molestation, gaslighting, and mind control.\nThe FOIL Incident and Arrest\nOn December 4, 2020, Judge Nancy Quinn-Koba issued a second ex parte TRO, again prohibiting Harding from contacting her children or entering the family residence. Harding’s emergency request for a hearing was denied. She filed a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division on December 30, 2020.\nOn January 4, 2021, Elizabeth Harding entered the Clerk’s Office in Briarcliff Manor to submit a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request and deliver a written complaint concerning Village Justice Howard T. Code, alleging denial of due process in prior proceedings.\nStaff refused to accept her documents because Harding was not wearing a face mask, in violation of the Village’s COVID-19 protocols. Harding declined to wear a mask, citing a medical exemption. Village Manager Philip Zegarelli and Clerk Donna Zirman summoned the Briarcliff Manor Police Department.\nResponding officers directed Harding to leave the premises. Harding recorded the encounter and stated her intention to post the footage online. Chief Bueti permitted her to submit the paperwork. However, he then allegedly shut the door on her, knocked her phone from her hand, physically restrained her against the wall, and placed her under arrest.\nShe was initially charged with disorderly conduct. The charges were later amended to obstruction of governmental administration and resisting arrest. Following the arrest, Harding was held in custody for several hours, during which she alleges she was shackled, subjected to a strip search, denied access to legal counsel, placed in solitary confinement, and held under suicide watch.\nOn January 5, 2021, during a virtual arraignment, Village Justice Howard T. Code ordered a psychiatric evaluation. Harding refused to participate.\nOn January 8, a court-appointed psychologist, Dr. Jerome Norton, attempted to conduct the evaluation. Harding again declined to consent to the assessment.\nCivil Lawsuit, Involuntary Hospitalization, and TROs\nFebruary 17, 2021\nElizabeth Harding filed a civil lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court naming multiple defendants, including her husband Brian Weinstein, municipal officials from the Village of Briarcliff Manor, local police officers, prosecutors, and members of the judiciary. The complaint alleged that Weinstein exploited his professional and judicial connections in Westchester County to discredit her, suppress her legal actions, and conceal alleged domestic violence and abuses of process.\nMarch 9, 2021\nHarding was involuntarily admitted to St. Vincent’s Hospital in Westchester County for psychiatric evaluation and treatment. She declined medication and requested a judicial hearing pursuant to New York Mental Hygiene Law §9.31. The hearing was postponed for approximately two weeks. Subsequently, Judge Anne E. Minihan ordered that Harding comply with a prescribed psychiatric medication regimen as a condition of release.\nMarch 17, 2021\nWhile Harding remained hospitalized, her state court civil action was dismissed on the grounds that it was “frivolous.” The court further initiated a mental health inquiry and raised the possibility of appointing a guardian ad litem to represent her legal interests in future proceedings.\nApril 2, 2021\nHarding was released from involuntary hospitalization at St. Vincent’s.\nApril 16, 2021\nJudge Nancy Quinn-Koba issued an ex parte Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Harding. Within minutes, Harding was stopped by Briarcliff Manor police and taken into custody. Officers claimed she had violated a prior TRO between April 5 and April 7, despite Harding’s contention that no such order had been entered or served during that period.\nShe was charged with misdemeanor violations, allegedly for posting a photograph of her minor children online. Later that day, Village Justice Halper issued a new ex parte TRO prohibiting Harding from coming within 1,500 feet of her home or her children.\nLizzie Is Relentless\nJune 1, 2021\nHarding doubled down. She continued to publish allegations against her husband on Facebook , alleging he had committed acts of sexual abuse, domestic violence, and coercive control. She accused him of alienating their children through psychological manipulation and drugging.\nShe claimed to have suffered false arrests, poisoning, and the deletion of her social media accounts. Harding alleged that courts at the state, appellate, and federal levels refused to hear her claims. She concluded by stating, “I WILL NOT STOP SPEAKING THE TRUTH.”\nJune 11, 2021\nHarding posted again on Facebook, stating she had been barred from attending her son Max’s graduation. She reiterated her accusations against Weinstein and stated, “SHAME FALLS SQUARELY ON PEDOPHILE BRIAN STRYKER WEINSTEIN.”\nJune 12, 2021\nHarding posted a photograph of Weinstein alongside his parents, Richard and Alice Weinstein, and accused the family of condoning and enabling child sexual abuse. She alleged that family members dismissed reports of abuse as “unfortunate” and stated her children were afraid of their grandfather. She referred to Weinstein as “100x worse than the slimiest parasite” and claimed he engaged in a campaign of psychological indoctrination targeting their son Max.\nGuardian Hearings\nJune 24 and June 30, 2021\nFollowing Harding’s public social media posts, Weinstein petitioned the Westchester County Supreme Court for the appointment of a guardian. According to reports, Weinstein submitted affidavits alleging that Harding suffered from schizophrenia and narcissistic and bipolar personality disorders. These allegations referenced her public accusations of pedophilia, all without evidence and cited online behavior he characterized as erratic, defamatory and harmful to the children. All three children rejected their mother’s claims about their father.\nJudge Janet C. Malone conducted two ex parte hearings to evaluate Harding’s competency, pursuant to Article 81 of the New York Mental Hygiene Law.\nAugust 2, 2021\nJudge Malone issued an order adjudicating Elizabeth Harding mentally incapacitated under MHL §81.02. She appointed attorney Kenneth L. Bunting as Guardian of the Property, with legal authority over Harding’s civil litigation, financial affairs, and access to the courts.\nImmediately following his appointment, Bunting moved to terminate Harding’s pending lawsuits. He informed relevant courts that no future filings were authorized unless issued directly from his office.\nHarding later alleged that Bunting exceeded his mandate by liquidating or freezing personal assets, closing financial accounts, withholding spousal support, and discontinuing critical services, such as automobile insurance. She contends these actions deprived her of resources necessary for food, shelter, and legal representation.\nAugust 11, 2021\nHarding posted on Twitter: “I will never stop fighting for my children… These pedophiles desecrate our societies—NOT ON MY WATCH.” At the time of the post, she had not seen her children for approximately 19 months.\nWith the guardianship order in effect, the court dismissed Harding’s pending divorce case for failure to prosecute. Weinstein refiled for divorce in his own name and was granted dissolution of the marriage by default, and consequently kept the entirety of the marital assets, as well as full legal and physical custody of the children.\nThe guardian prevented Harding from contesting or participating in her own divorce.\nThe Battle Is Over\nNothing changed during the last four years of her life.\nIn her videos, she’s the last honest woman in a world of liars. To the court, she was a mother declared unfit.\nThe kids, now all over the age of 18, remain close to their father. The funeral was Monday. Her ex-husband and three children attended.\nThis is a cautionary tale for the age of accusation.\nShe had lost her children. Her legal standing. Her money, her freedom. And in the end, her life.\nShe also nearly cost her family everything. Their reputation. Their father. Their peace.\nThe obituary reads:\nElizabeth “Lizzie” Harding Weinstein, a registered nurse, mother of three, and former Westchester resident, studied early childhood education at Boston University before earning her nursing degree from Columbia University. She is survived by her three children, Max, Ella, and Jack; her parents; and extended family.\nShe was 53.\nWhat it did not say was that she was homeless for five years, starting about two weeks after she began accusing her lawyer husband of pedophilia.\nHarding lost custody of her children, access to her home, control over her finances, and ultimately her legal standing—without ever having a full evidentiary hearing on the truth of her claims.\nHowever, Harding’s allegations were unsupported by their three teenagers, third-party witnesses, forensic evidence, or law enforcement corroboration.\nThe legal system never said Harding was lying. It ruled that she was not credible enough to be heard.\nHer husband used TROs, psychiatric evaluations, and guardianship law to sideline an inconvenient, volatile and possibly delusional voice.\nShe never provided forensic evidence, eyewitness corroboration, or proof of a criminal inquiry in all her videos and posts.\nHad Harding’s allegations been believed and acted upon, Weinstein would have faced professional ruin, disbarment, and criminal charges.\nThe damage would not stop with him. The children would become known as the offspring of a molester. Their schooling, relationships, and mental health could suffer. If the allegations were untrue, or driven by illness, the harm would be irreversible.\nMental Illness Cannot Be Ignored\nHarding’s conduct was not helpful to her credibility. She live-streamed videos, made accusations on social media, and described coordinated conspiracies. She refused psychiatric evaluation, refused medication when committed, and rejected the authority of multiple courts. Over time, while some of the public may have believed her, judges reached a shared conclusion: she was mentally unstable.\nWhether or not that diagnosis was correct, her behavior gave the court justification to take precautionary steps. From their perspective, this was not silencing. It was containment.\n“What if she was right?” is a question weighed against “What if she was severely ill?”\nAnd when one party appears unstable—especially if they are publicly attacking judges, guardians, and therapists—the courts will protect the calmer, more institutionally compliant party.\nIf Elizabeth Harding was wrong, her accusations were reckless, damaging, and cruel. If she was mentally ill, she was treated as a legal liability rather than a health emergency. And if she was right—if there was any truth to what she alleged—then the law turned its back on a woman who tried to speak out.\nStill, Harding accused Weinstein of serious crimes but offered no evidence. Where were the children’s statements? The school reports? The disclosures? She posted online, named therapists as “handlers,” and accused his entire family of “grooming.” She tried to crash graduation ceremonies, filmed her own arrest, defied court orders, and posted daily videos on Facebook.\nSo her husband, a lawyer, retaliated with filings. He asked judges to protect his children, to secure their futures, to limit what Elizabeth kept igniting.\nThe law was used not just to silence her—but to survive her.\nShe gambled the family’s future on a theory she couldn’t prove. He gambled too. Because if she wasn’t stopped, her narrative could destroy his children, his career, and everything he had built.\nIf she wasn’t mentally ill, she was reckless. And while her case shows the built-in injustices in family court, it also illustrates the harm that can be done by false allegations and how the court for all its imperfections may have delivered justice.\nWhere this case is distinguished from many other cases where the court is used as a weapon by the wealthier parent is that the pivotal, deciding factor was the children. If they said it had happened, it would not have ended this way.\nBut they said it did not happen and, in the end, in this case – and in perhaps most cases – we ought to believe the children – then and now as young adults. They knew their mother was delusional and wished, as they had said, she could have been treated. She wasn’t. It can’t be helped now.\nMay Lizzie Harding rest in peace.\nFrank Parlato is an investigative journalist, media strategist, publisher, and legal consultant.",

    "title": "Little girl critically injured in Parnell Square attack has smiled, mother reveals - Dublin Live",
    "text": "The little girl critically injured in the Dublin crèche attack is out of danger – and has even smiled, her mother has revealed. The five year old, who suffered serious injuries in the November 23 attack on the crèche at Gaelscoil Cholaiste Mhuire on the city’s Parnell Square East, is still receiving hospital treatment – but her mum says her condition has now improved. The mother last night took to a special GoFundme page - *’Barróg do Chailín Beag’ (A Hug for a Little Girl) - * to help the family with costs following the incident to thank everyone for their help and give the good news about the girl’s condition. She told contributors that her daughter left the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of CHI’s Temple Street Hospital close to the scene of the attack a fortnight ago. She said: “Hi everyone, here is the little girl’s mum. “Just to wish everyone a delayed [Christmas](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/christmas) and a Happy new year. “Our angel has been out of the PICU for two weeks now. She is more alert and even smiled. “We still have a long time still in hospital, but she is out of danger. Thank you everyone for all the help and support. All our love.” The child has been in hospital since the November 23 attack – in which two other kids and three adults were injured. The special [GoFundme page](https://gofund.me/6b6f1e1e) was set up in the wake of the attack and as of last night has raised more than €58,000 for the child and her family. News of the girl’s improvement came as Riad Bouchaker, 50, of no fixed abode, made his second court appearance over the alleged attack. Mr Bouchaker is charged with three counts of attempted murder, one of producing and possessing a 36cm kitchen knife, three counts of assault causing harm and one of assault causing serious harm. He was remanded in custody yesterday to appear at Cloverhill District Court in west [Dublin](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/dublin) on January 25. The same court heard yesterday that he is to face trial in front of a judge and jury on the charges and a book of evidence is now being prepared.

    "title": "Brahim Baya (moschea Torino), niente preghiera al Politecnico/ Dopo la diffida attacca: \"Italia è islamofoba\"",
    "text": "Brahim Baya (moschea Torino), niente preghiera al Politecnico/ Dopo la diffida attacca: “Italia è islamofoba” Brahim Baya, portavoce di una moschea di Torino e non imam diventa un caso: dopo una preghiera al Politecnico, riceve una diffida. E lui attacca: \"Italia è islamofoba\" Niente preghiera islamica nel pomeriggio di venerdì al Politecnico di Torino per via della diffida ricevuta dalla Questura di Torino. Lo ha dichiarato il predicatore Brahim Baya, rivelando di essere stato convocato dal capo gabinetto della questura, da cui ha ricevuto una diffida del questore a tenere tale manifestazione, di cui lui è considerato l’organizzatore. Ma la diffida non è stata firmata dal predicatore, che dal canto suo ha chiarito che era stato interpellato semplicemente celebrare una preghiera, cosa che avrebbe potuto fare chiunque. Il problema per Brahim Baya è un altro, cioè «l’islamofobia» dell’Italia. Il [caos è cominciato per la preghiera](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/torino-nelluniversita-occupata-limam-prega-per-la-jihad-video-contribuiamo-tutti-alla-lotta-palestinese/2708979/) organizzata dal portavoce della moschea Taiba, in via Chivasso, nell’università le cui aule erano state occupate dagli studenti filopalestinesi: era prevista una replica nel pomeriggio di venerdì, poi a causa della diffida, la preghiera è stata cancellata. Una decisione “scandalosa” per il predicatore, il cui obiettivo non era quello di creare una moschea nell’università, ma uno spazio di preghiera. IL SERMONE DEL PREDICATORE A TORINO D’altra parte, c’è chi ricorda come invece vada preservata la laicità degli atenei da tutte le religioni. Dunque, il sermone è diventato un caso anche tra gli stessi studenti perché, come rivelato dal Manifesto che cita alcune fonti, il comunicato con le accuse di islamofobia non è condiviso da tutti gli studenti, anche dello stesso gruppo studentesco. Pare che la preghiera sia stata voluta dagli studenti musulmani in accordo con i rappresentanti degli occupanti. Come ricostruito da Tg La7, nel sermone ha esordito ringraziando chi sta protestando sostenendo la Palestina e ha sottolineato la resistenza dei palestinesi, ricordando le parole del profeta Muhammad, secondo cui non bisogna accettare ingiustizia e male. Per quanto riguarda la Palestina, Brahim Baye aveva parlato di invasori contro cui è stata opposta resistenza e di una furia omicida. La loro resistenza, per il predicatore, rappresenta un esempio, associando la loro sofferenza alla jihad. I RETTORI DI TORINO ALL’ATTACCO DEL PREDICATORE La decisione della diffida, secondo Brahim Baya, è «incostituzionale» e contrasta con i principi della libertà religiosa della Carta. La richiesta di diffida era stata presentata dal rettore del Politecnico di Torino, Paolo Corgnati, in accordo con la ministra dell’Università Anna Maria Bernini. A proposito della Jihad, spiega che sia una parola fraintesa in Occidente, perché il suo significato è sforzo, quello che i musulmani compiono per essere migliori, quindi non avrebbe nulla a che fare con la guerra santa. Il predicatore se la prende anche con gli stessi musulmani, che hanno usato questa parola «per seminare violenza e morte, bestemmiando Dio». In merito alla preghiera all’università di Torino, per Baya sono state diffuse diverse falsità, infatti ribadisce di essersi limitato a officiare una preghiera e chiarisce di non aver mai attaccato [Israele](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/gaza-cpi-netanyahu-mieli-lerner-segre-quelle-strane-divisioni-su-israele/2708737/), ma di aver difeso la dignità dei palestinesi considerate vittime di un «massacro quotidiano», condannando le violenze sui civili. Di diverso avvisto è Stefano Geuna, rettore dell’Università di Torino, secondo cui Brahim Baya avrebbe reso dichiarazioni violente nel sermone e espresso valori che contrastano con la pace e la convivenza tra i popoli, motivo per il quale ha condannato quanto accaduto. © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "bluefield — Summer heat has brought forth free lemonade that’s being poured today in the Bluefields, but rainy forecasts and cooling temperatures could put a dent in the region’s current drought. On Monday, a high of 90 degrees was reported at the Mercer County Airport, according to the National Weather Service in Blacksburg, Va. The Chamber of Commerce of the Two Virginias was informed that same day, so free lemonade will be served today for the first time since 2019. Ever since 1941, free lemonade has been served after the official temperature reaches 90 degrees or more. Free lemonade will be served today between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. at city park in Bluefield in the grassy area near the tennis courts, at the Tailyard Dog Park in downtown Bluefield and at Jack Asbury Square in downtown Bluefield, Va. In contrast to the previous days of dry conditions and temperatures approaching 90 degrees, the National Weather Service in Blacksburg, Va. has forecasted periods of showers and thunderstorms today and into early next week. Today’s forecast includes a 20% chance of rain for today and 40% tonight for the Bluefield area and a 30% chance in the Tazewell, Va. area. There is a 70% chance of rain Saturday with a high of 80 degrees, plus a chance of thunderstorms Saturday night, according to the National Weather Service in Blacksburg, Va. Between a quarter inch to a half inch of rain is possible Saturday in both areas. A weather front stalling over the mid-Atlantic states and the Southwest is bringing periods of showers and some thunderstorms, said meteorologist William Perry with the Blacksburg weather service. The forecast going into next week shows a possibility of 1.5 to 3 inches of rain, but thunderstorms could always bring in more precipitation. Since June 1, the region’s total rainfall has been around 4 inches below normal, Perry said. “June and July have been dry,” he said. “That’s why we have a drought on. Most of southwest West Virginia is in a severe drought. This next week could put some kind of dent in the drought.” While the heat has brought free lemonade to the Bluefields, it has also led to warnings that residents across the region should forego outdoor burning. On July 15, a 10-day burning ban was started in Tazewell County, Va. The ban was set to continue until July 25, and it will be reviewed by the Tazewell Board of Supervisors. County Administrator Eric Young was unavailable Thursday, but the burn ban was still in effect. The Tazewell County ban includes all outdoor burning activities, excluding cooking conducted within contained gas or charcoal grills. The goal of the burn ban is to prevent the spread of wildfires and safeguarding both residents and the region’s natural environment, said A.J. Robinson, director of community development. Violating the burn ban is considered a class-one misdemeanor, Robinson said. According to the Code of Virginia § 18.2-11, a Class 1 misdemeanor has a possible sentence of up to 12 months in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500. People seeking clarification or with questions are encouraged to reach out to the Tazewell County Department of Emergency Management at the non-emergency number at 276-322-7393. To report burn ban violations, call the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office at 276-988-0645. For immediate concerns about active, uncontrolled fires, dial 911, Robinson said. On June 27, the Tazewell County Public Service Authority asked its customers to conserve water due to the low amounts of rainfall that month. The low water levels were mainly at the Claypool Hill treatment plant in the Wardell area, PSA Administrator Jan Cordle said. The area was not running out of water, but the authority’s 6,800 customers were asked to reduce the amount of water they use. The water levels being seen in July usually do not occur until August. Young said then that conserving water was voluntary and the county was not making it mandatory. Contact Greg Jordan at",

    "text": "[talkesi](/user/talkesi)a [arainfo.org](/go/link/3942599)\nEs inconstitucional, España, aunque aún no lo parezca, es un estado aconfesional y en consecuencia se está vulnerando el artículo 16 de la constitución.\nHay que denunciar todos y cada uno de los ataques a nuestra democracia.\nSinceramente, esto es una puta aberración.\nUn disparate que sólo puede provenir de los enfermizos seguidores de esas sectas destructivas que basan su razón de ser en la existencia de seres imaginarios.\nEquiparar las creencias personales de gente que parece experimentar auténticas alucinaciones del mundo real con las creencias procedentes del resultado de milenios de investigación y que han llegado a consensos cuasi irrefutables, es decir los que proceden de la ciencia, es una auténtica mostruosidad y da una idea de hasta que punto de regresión se está llevando a cabo con esta panda de facinerosos salvajes.\nEs una iniciativa, no una ley. Y como ley no puede ser aporobada porque contraviene la ley marco, que es estatal. Brindis al sol, titular tendencioso.\nVoto errónea.\n[#11](c11#c-11) No puedes votar errónea por que presentarlo lo han presentado, que necesiten clases para entenderlo ya es cosa suya y de su guía espiritual",
