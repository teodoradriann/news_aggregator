    "title": "مصادر لـNBC: إسرائيل تدرس شن هجوم ضد إيران بالأيام المقبلة على الأرجح دون دعم أميركا",
    "text": "كشف خمسة أشخاص مطّلعين، لشبكة \"إن بي سي نيوز- NBC NEWS\" الأميركيّة، أنّ \"إسرائيل تدرس القيام بعمل عسكري ضدّ إيران -على الأرجح بدون دعم الولايات المتّحدة الأميركيّة- في الأيّام المقبلة، حتّى في الوقت الّذي يجري فيه الرّئيس الأميركي دونالد ترامب مناقشات متقدّمة مع طهران بشأن اتفاق دبلوماسي للحدّ من برنامجها النّووي\".\nوأوضحت الشّبكة أنّ \"إسرائيل أصبحت أكثر جدّيّةً بشأن توجيه ضربة أحاديّة الجانب لإيران، حيث تبدو المفاوضات بين الولايات المتّحدة وإيران أقرب إلى اتفاق أوّلي أو إطاري يتضمّن أحكامًا بشأن تخصيب اليورانيوم، تعتبرها إسرائيل غير مقبولة\".\nوأشارت إلى أنّ \"أي ضربة أو عمل أحادي الجانب من جانب إسرائيل ضدّ إيران، من شأنه أن يشكّل قطيعةً دراماتيكيّةً مع إدارة ترامب، الّتي جادلت ضدّ مثل هذه الخطوة\"، مبيّنةً أنّ \"إدارة ترامب تنتظر ردًّا من إيران بشأن الإطار المقترَح للاتفاق النّووي، وقد صرّح ترامب علنًا بأنّ طهران أصبحت أكثر تشدّدًا في مفاوضاتها\".\nولفت مصدران مطّلعان لـ\"NBC\"، إلى أنّ \"فكرة فتح جبهة جديدة في صراع متصاعد، دفعت إدارة ترامب إلى إصدار أوامر لجميع السّفارات الموجودة ضمن نطاق الصّواريخ والطائرات والأصول الإيرانيّة الأخرى (بما في ذلك البعثات في الشّرق الأوسط وشمال إفريقيا وشرق أوروبا)، بإرسال برقيّات تتضمّن تقييمات حول الخطر، وحول التّدابير اللّازمة للتّخفيف من المخاطر على الأميركيّين والبنية التحتيّة الأميركيّة\".",

    "text": "Macklin Celebrini is thrilled his college teammates are getting the opportunity. He's also hoping to see them return to the NCAA bitterly disappointed. The presumptive top pick at the 2024 NHL draft, Celebrini has paused his season at Boston University in hopes of winning gold with Canada at the world junior hockey championship. There are some familiar faces — Lane Hutson of the United States and Sweden's Tom Willander — kicking around Gothenburg looking to do the same. \"If you take a step back, you're happy for everyone,\" Celebrini said of the defencemen. \"But not while we're here.\" The 17-year-old Vancouver native burst onto the scene with the Terriers this season, putting up 10 goals and 25 points in 15 games before making his country's roster for the under-20 tournament. He's already added a pair of goals and four assists in two appearances at the annual showcase in Sweden. Hutson is 19 and was always going to be part of the U.S. setup if healthy, but Celebrini and the 18-year-old Willander were far less assured of spots on their national teams back in the fall. \"It's pretty cool,\" said Hutson, a 2022 second-round pick of the Montreal Canadiens. \"Two great players. They deserve to be here.\" Willander, like Celebrini, is in his first NCAA season. \"It's been a long time since we had the tournament on home ice,\" the 11th overall selection by the Vancouver Canucks last June said of the world juniors. \"To be part of that is pretty cool. \"It'll be fun to see which of us can get the gold.\" Hutson, who helped the U.S. grab bronze at last year's world juniors in Halifax and Moncton, N.B., had 48 points in 39 games for BU in 2022-23. He's started just as strong this season with eight goals and 12 assists in 15 contests. \"A lot is made of his offensive attributes and upside,\" said first-year American coach David Carle. \"But I was most impressed by his desire and willingness to take away time and space without the puck, and to defend. \"You have to be able to do it at both ends of the rink.\" Willander, meanwhile, chose the NCAA route over playing professionally in Sweden. \"The development there is really good,\" he said of suiting up for ex-NHLer and former Boston Bruins assistant Jay Pandolfo at BU. Hutson said his college defence partner was making big strides before getting on the flight to Europe. Willander has three goals and five assists in 15 games so far in 2023-24. \"Really reliable on his own end,\" Hutson said. \"Untapped offensive ability he's figuring out. I'm excited for what the future holds.\" The blueliners have also both been blown away by what Celebrini has shown as a freshman sometimes pitted against opponents as old as 25. \"Really good offensively, obviously,\" Willander said. \"But not a lot of those kinds of players get recognition for having a good overall game. The way he plays as a centre is really helpful for me as a defenceman. \"Complete player.\" Celebrini's maturity also stood out as soon as he arrived on campus. \"He could fit in with guys who are 30 or 40,\" Hutson said. \"That's pretty special and you don't find with a 17-year-old. The way he plays the game, he's reliable. There's no ego or arrogance. \"He's there to work. Then his skill takes over.\" Hutson did, however, get the better of Celebrini in pre-tournament play when he scored in overtime to beat Canada 6-5. \"Couldn't help but smile at him and he was smiling back,\" Hutson said. \"One of the best players I've ever played with. It's pretty special to not only compete against him in practice, but in a game setting.\" Celebrini and Willander will get that chance in a crucial Group A game Friday when Sweden, which fell 5-3 to the U.S. in pre-tournament action, faces Canada at a packed-to-the-rafters Scandinavium arena. \"I'll definitely be watching,\" Hutson said. \"Excited to see how it goes.\" It's also likely the Americans, who sit atop Group B, will run into Canada or Sweden — or both — in the medal round. \"Texted a little bit with Macklin and Tom before we were gonna play each other for the exhibition games,\" Hutson said. \"Not so much during.\" When the messages do appear on their screens, it's not like back in Boston. \"Everyone's representing their own country,\" Celebrini said. \"You want to get the upper hand.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023. ___ Follow @JClipperton_CP on X.",

    "text": "The search continues for a North Carolina man who has been missing for nearly a month.\nClinton Bonnell, 50, was last seen in the Gray’s Creek community on January 27. Though details are scarce, Bonnell’s sister told WTVD one of his last known locations was at the Fit4Life gym in Fayetteville.\nAfter leaving the gym, Bonnell is believed to have gone to Methodist University, where he is enrolled in the physician assistant program. He texted a friend he was heading home, but alarms were raised when he did not return to school the next day, according to WTVD.\n“I know what he was doing the day that he disappeared and he was making plans for his life, and studying for exams the next day. I mean, all signs point to him vanishing not on his own accord,” his sister commented.\nBonnell was reportedly a Green Beret medic, and his sister told The Fayetteville Observer that he retired from the military a month before his disappearance.\n“He was happy and doing really well,” she said.\n“He was not the type of veteran that has no focus, no drive and feels lost after retirement. He was excited.”\nAccording to The Fayetteville Observer, Bonnell’s phone has been off since January 28. Cumberland County police conducted a welfare check at his home and only located his car.\nBonnell was described as being 6 feet tall and weighing 195 pounds. He last was seen wearing a plaid button-up shirt, a black hoodie, and brown pants.\nAnyone with information regarding Bonnell’s whereabouts is asked to call Sergeant J. McLeod at 910-677-5548 or Cumberland County Crimestoppers at 910-483-TIPS.\n[Feature Photo: Cumberland County police]",
