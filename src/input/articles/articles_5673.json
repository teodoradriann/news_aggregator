    "text": "Newswise — About three years before he retired, David Campbell noticed something weird happening as he typed. Whenever he tried to hit a letter, say “a,” he’d get “aaa,” like the keyboard was jamming or his finger was triple-tapping the key. That wasn’t the only thing that seemed off—his sense of smell was faltering. “Little things,” he says, “that I didn’t think of as being a big deal.”\nA couple of weeks after he retired in fall 2020, Campbell learned the little things weren’t so little—they were life-changing. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The repeated “a” was caused by a slight tremor as nerve cells in his brain degenerated or died, interrupting the signals controlling his muscles. A tremor is many patients’ first Parkinson’s symptom, followed by a raft of other steadily worsening neurological issues, such as a quieter voice, slower movement, stiffer limbs, and tighter facial expressions. Almost all patients will suffer some loss of smell too.\nAlthough therapy and medications can bring some relief from the neurodegenerative disorder, there’s no cure. Somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million Americans have Parkinson’s, including actor Michael J. Fox, singer Neil Diamond, and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson.\nFor Campbell, it was a pretty shabby retirement gift. As he tried to adjust to his new reality, the former Boston University laboratory engineer joined a support group and decided to volunteer for research studies that aimed to improve treatment—perhaps even plot the route to a cure. “I figured, I have the disease,” he says, “I might as well try to do something good with it.”\nThat decision is already having an impact. With the help of volunteers like Campbell, researchers at Boston University’s\nCenter for Neurorehabilitation, a hub for Parkinson’s research, education, and clinical care, have made two important advances that may help people with the disease walk more smoothly, even turn their shuffled steps into confident strides. In one study, they used wearable soft robotic apparel—a series of fabric wraps, cables, actuators, and sensors—to help patients walk farther and faster. A second study used a music-based technology to increase walking duration and distance—controlling a song’s beats per minute to keep the steps up.\nBased at BU Sargent College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences, the center has been at the forefront of research establishing the benefits of exercise and physical therapy in taming Parkinson’s disease’s impact and improving quality of life. And both of the newly tested therapies could find their way into patients’ everyday lives relatively quickly. The robotic device uses technology that’s already commercially available; the musical intervention uses store-bought headphones. But, says\nTerry Ellis, the Center for Neurorehabilitation’s director, without the volunteers who give up hours of their time to participate in research studies or help her team test ideas and tweak gadgets, none of it would be possible.\nThat’s a story told across BU. Volunteers join research studies—as well as classroom discussions and clinical training programs—on a wide range of topics, participating in person or from home.\nSome even do it over decades, like those who’ve given their time to the long-running Framingham Heart Study and BU’s Black Women’s Health Study.\n“Most of our research is intervention studies, so there’s hypothetically some benefit for them,” says Ellis of her center’s work. Their fitness may improve, they may get to try out some symptom-relieving tools. “But without them, we couldn’t do the work. I’m always saying to [volunteers], the work wouldn’t exist without your participation and contribution.”\nRobotic Apparel Eliminates Freezing of Gait\nBeing a research study guinea pig can be rewarding, and might even save or improve lives, but it’s hardly glamorous work. For most of the apparel study, the main volunteer (unnamed in the final paper to protect their privacy) spent his time walking back and forth—again, and again, and again. At first, it was to get a baseline of his walking ability, then to allow the researchers to monitor the robotic tech’s effectiveness at shifting his stride and fine-tune the technology.\nThe patient, a 73-year-old male who’d been diagnosed with Parkinson’s 10 years earlier, was struggling with a common Parkinson’s problem known as freezing of gait. During a freezing episode, thought to be caused by a malfunction in the brain’s locomotor circuitry, a patient’s stride shortens, their walking speed tumbles, and their muscle coordination falls out of whack. Then they just stop—it reportedly feels like their feet are glued to the floor. Things had gotten so bad for the patient working with Ellis—more than 10 freezing episodes a day, resulting in multiple falls—he’d taken to getting around on a kick scooter.\n“It’s just devastating,” says Ellis (CAMED’05), a Sargent professor and chair of physical therapy. “There’s really no medicine or surgery that improves this. It interferes tremendously with people’s everyday life.”\nShe and her colleagues had tried wearable robotic apparel with people recovering from a stroke—finding it helped some regain\ntheir pre-stroke walking speeds—and wondered if similar technology might work for Parkinson’s too. That exosuit, which is now commercially available for stroke rehabilitation from medical device company ReWalk Robotics, was derived from a model developed for the military by Harvard University’s Biodesign Lab to increase service members’ endurance.\nIn most iterations, the robotic apparel looks like a highly engineered sports brace, using an algorithm to drive motors and cables that strategically apply forces to supplement muscles and joints. The version the researchers tailored for the Parkinson’s study featured two bands: one around the waist, the other around the thigh, each connected by a spooled cable. When activated, the spool turns, retracting the cable and pulling the thigh up. Ellis calls it a mechanical assist: “It provides a little bit of force—it’s perceptible, but at a very low level.” The algorithm helps time the assistance to the users’ steps and tailor the amount of force needed.\nAs the study progressed, the researchers put their volunteer through his paces with a range of different tasks, including timed walking tests in the lab and outside in the community, adjusting the force provided by the suit—and its timing—and assessing the biomechanics of his walking.\nThe results were striking: when the suit was on, the volunteer strolled easily down the corridor, arms and legs swinging with a natural confidence; when it was powered down, the change was almost instant—he staggered, stumbled, shuffled, and grabbed at the wall for balance.\nWhen switched on, the robotic apparel eliminated his freezing of gait—the first time any study has shown a potential way to overcome the debilitating symptom. The findings were\npublished in Nature Medicine.\n“It’s pretty amazing,” says Ellis, who collaborated with researchers from BU and Harvard University. “We think we’re driving an increase in step length and that’s preventing the shortening of the steps that leads to freezing. In future, we envision you could wear this like underclothes.” Her coauthors include\nConor Walsh, a Harvard University professor of engineering and applied sciences; Franchino Porciuncula, a Sargent research scientist; and Jinsoo Kim, a Stanford University postdoctoral scholar and recent Harvard PhD student.\nThe researchers even did an informal test outside the study, letting the volunteer take the apparel for a spin at home. “And he did pretty well,” says Ellis. “There were certain tight spots where it didn’t work as well as we would want, so we talked about playing with the algorithm to make it work better.”\nThis was just a small study with one patient, so the next stage would be scaling the project up with more volunteers. But Ellis says because the base technology is already commercially available through ReWalk, there aren’t many barriers to getting the suit into clinics. She pictures a near future where a patient visits a physical therapist, their walking is assessed, and they get robotic apparel tailored for their needs. Even without the tech, the team’s findings on the biomechanics of freezing gait may help therapists better target treatments to combat it.\nWalking to the Beat Improves Quality of Life with Parkinson’s\nAnother volunteer being helped to hit her stride is Ann Greehy. A former school guidance counselor, she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2015 and began volunteering at BU three years later. Her most recent contribution was as a volunteer on a project examining the use of music as a walking aid.\nIn a\nnew study published in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease, Ellis and Porciuncula found they could use a song’s beats per minute to help people increase their gait speed and stride length, and cut out variability in their walking patterns. Greehy was one of those who’d helped them assess the technology.\nDuring the study, researchers placed sensors in subjects’ shoes to monitor their gait and gave them an Android device loaded with a music software app. The proprietary system, which uses a technique known as rhythmic auditory stimulation, plays music with beats per minute tailored to a patients’ natural walking cadence, helping them gradually increase their pace session by session; all the participants were asked to plug in their headphones and walk for 30 minutes, five days a week.\n“It was amazing when the beats started—it was a whole new experience,” says Greehy. “You put your shoulders back and you’re up walking.”\nAfter four weeks of using the system, which was developed by neurorehab company MedRhythms, the 23 study participants had a similar experience to Greehy. The researchers found that, compared to baseline, they had higher rates of daily moderate intensity walking (up by an average of 21.44 minutes) and more steps (up by 3,384 steps). In the paper, they noted “quality of life, disease severity, walking endurance, and functional mobility were improved after four weeks.”\n“People with Parkinson’s can’t move automatically—they have to think about the movement,” says Ellis, who collaborated on the study with researchers from the University of New England, Johns Hopkins University, and MedRhythms. The part of the brain, the basal ganglia, that sends the signals that help people walk without deliberate thought is dysfunctional. “You can’t possibly keep that level of attention to the task of walking, so we were trying to figure out how to provide an external signal if the internal signal is not working.”\nThe music provided that signal—in the same way your workout playlist gets your feet moving on the gym treadmill. “You’re not thinking, ‘Oh, I want to run to the beat of the music,’” says Ellis. “It just happens, and so it takes a lot less cognitive energy.”\nMaking Sense of Life with Parkinson’s\nOne of Greehy’s highlights of the music study was making Ellis’ students laugh by sharing her favorite track: rapper Flo Rida’s “Club Can’t Handle Me.” They were “on the floor laughing at this old lady who likes Flo Rida,” she says. Like Greehy, many of the volunteers also come into BU to work with students, sitting in on classes and panels, talking to them about living with Parkinson’s disease, answering their questions, and giving them a chance to practice their care skills. Some volunteers also attend the Center for Neurorehabilitation as a patient, receiving physical therapy services.\n“Our research and clinic are one and the same,” says Ellis. “That chasm that can exist between research and clinical practice doesn’t exist here. The questions we try to answer with research come from our interactions with patients in the clinic—it’s their challenges and problems that they bring to us that make us curious about how to solve them.” And when they find a solution, they take it straight into the clinic.\nAnother of the music study volunteers and clinic patients, retired psychologist Ed Hattauer, appreciates that focus on making lives better—including his own. “As an old-time PhD researcher, I really relish in the importance of doing research, but research that’s very practically oriented toward helping people do things.” Hattauer says that when he comes to the center, there’s “really a sense of personal caring that gets communicated. And I think what I carry away is a sense of hope. It helps sustain my hope and my feeling of emotional connection.”\nGreehy says there are a whole bunch of factors that keep her coming back: “I’ve gotten so much out of this it’s not even funny.” She loves working with students, she gets great tips from the therapists about maintaining her hobbies, like gardening, and she feels good being part of the push for a solution to the disease. Most importantly, volunteering has helped her make sense of life after her diagnosis.\n“What are you going to do with this disease?” says Greehy. “Are you just going to sit back or are we going to jump in? I want us to do more to wipe this thing out. I think it’s time.”\nLike other volunteers, Greehy knows the disease probably won’t be cured in her lifetime, but it won’t stop her trying.\n“I don’t know if they’ll find a cure for me necessarily,” says Campbell, “but I’ve been around research and development my whole life and it feels good to contribute in whatever way possible. I could just sit at home and wallow in pity and do nothing, but it feels proactive to go out and make an effort to advance the science.”\nRepublishers are kindly reminded to uphold journalistic integrity by providing proper crediting, including\na direct link back to the original source URL here.\nMEDIA CONTACT\n[Register for reporter access to contact details](/users/register)\nCITATIONS\nNature Medicine",

    "text": "L’année scolaire 2024-2025 se referme dans la douleur pour de nombreuses écoles du Nord-Kivu, en particulier dans les entités sous occupation du M23, comme Goma et ses environs. Entre insécurité persistante, déplacements de populations et crise économique, la fin d’année est marquée par une désorganisation généralisée du système éducatif.\nSelon plusieurs experts du secteur, certaines écoles ont enregistré un taux de déperdition de 30 à 50 %, en raison du déplacement massif des parents et de la précarité ambiante. À Goma, Bukavu et dans d’autres entités affectées, enseignants comme élèves ont peiné à maintenir le cap.\n« Les enfants traversent des conditions sociales très difficiles. Le stress affecte leur performance scolaire », témoigne Théo Ciraba, responsable d’une école privée.\nLes écoles privées ne sont pas épargnées. Beaucoup d’entre elles font face à des impayés massifs de frais scolaires, compromettant leur fonctionnement. Dans le secteur public, les grèves à répétition, le non-paiement des enseignants et l’insécurité n’ont pas permis de mener à bien le programme national.\nClôture décalée, espoir à reconstruire\nDans ce contexte, le calendrier scolaire a été réaménagé. Les écoles publiques des zones occupées clôtureront l’année le 5 août, tandis que les établissements privés et adventistes mettront fin aux cours dès le 12 juillet.\nAu-delà des chiffres, cette situation met en lumière l’urgence d’un plan de résilience éducative en temps de crise.

Ma dovrà operarsi al cuore\nMarco Cappato abbraccia i suoi fan e tutte le persone che gli hanno dedicato un messaggio, anche un solo pensiero, dopo la notizia dell’ischemia che l’ha colpito a Capodanno, costringendolo a un ricovero di 4 giorni all’ospedale Parini di Aosta.\nE l’ha fatto proprio mettendoci la faccia, con un video condiviso sul suo account Instagram: “Ciao. Come vedete che sono a casa.”, le parole d’esordio del tesoriere dell’Associazione Luca Coscioni, diventato celebre negli ultimi anni per le sue battagli per i diritti (in primis sul suicidio assistito).\nIl paladino dei diritti ha poi voluto tranquillizzare tutti riguardo le sue condizioni do salute: “Sto bene, lo dico per tutte le persone che si sono preoccupate. In particolare mi dispiace molto e sto recuperando energie. Forse dovrò fare una piccola, ma non problematica, operazione al cuore nelle prossime settimane e quindi il recupero sta andando bene.”\nPoi il ringraziamento per l’ondata di affetto che l’ha travolto dopo la diffusione della notizia del malore, rimasto nascosta fino alla dimissione: “Volevo ringraziare tutte le persone che mi hanno scritto. Mi hanno mandato messaggi in queste ore e mi hanno chiamato grazie”. Poi una dedica speciale allo staff della struttura sanitaria che l’ha ospitato nei giorni del ricovero: “Un grazie particolare a tutto il personale dell’ospedale Parini di Aosta. Sono stati fantastici e professionali, ma anche gentile e umani. E questo è molto importante”.\nInfine, i “buoni propositi” per portare avanti nuove, ma anche le vecchi, battaglie nel campo dei diritti: “Sto recuperando le energie perché temo ce ne sarà bisogno in questo 2024 per le lotte e battaglie dell’Associazione Luca Coscioni degli Eumans con chi di voi le vorrà combattere insieme”. Poi gli auguri: “E comunque a tutte e a tutti auguri per un buon 2024. Ci siamo. Ciao!”.",

    "title": "El truco para que tu ventilador de techo enfríe más que podrías haber pasado por alto",
    "text": "Los ventiladores de techo son muy buenos aliados contra el calor . Cada vez más personas deciden utilizar estos artilugios en vez del típico aire acondicionado . Los hay solo con las aspas, con luz incorporada o incluso con aspas adaptables para que podamos cambiar tanto su velocidad como el sentido de giro. Esto último es muy importante, ya que nos ayuda a aprovechar estos ventiladores tanto en invierno como en verano. Es de lo más útil, pero resulta esencial saber cuál es el sentido idóneo de las aspas en cada época del año. Si no, puede que en vez de enfriarnos estemos aumentando todavía más el calor en la habitación.\nLos ventiladores de techo que no tienen la posibilidad de cambiar el sentido de giro lo hacen siempre al contrario de las agujas del reloj . Esto es así porque están diseñados únicamente para su uso en verano. Es imposible equivocarse.\nEn cambio, si se pueden cambiar todos esos parámetros, debemos tener cuidado. Algunos incluyen directamente lo que se conoce como modo invierno y modo verano . Así, no hay lugar al error. Pero si hacemos el cambio de forma manual, el sentido debe ser siempre horario en invierno y antihorario en verano.\n¿Por qué es tan importante el sentido de las aspas de los ventiladores de techo? Las capas de aire en una estancia se distribuyen por temperaturas . El más frío y denso tiende a quedarse abajo, mientras que el caliente se desplaza hacia arriba y queda más pegado al techo. Los ventiladores de techo se encargan de mover esas capas , creando una corriente dentro de la habitación.\nCuando se mueven sus aspas en el sentido contrario de las agujas del reloj, se crea una corriente descendente . Es decir, el aire caliente baja, ocupa el lugar del frío en la parte de abajo y obliga a este a desplazarse hacia los lados . Por eso, ese aire frío que estaba estancado se mueve y ayuda a que nos refresquemos. Si además las aspas se mueven deprisa, notaremos más esta sensación.\nAlgunos ventiladores de techo tienen modo invierno y modo verano. Crédito: Kalyanaraman (Unsplahs) En cambio, en invierno se hace todo lo contrario. Las aspas de los ventiladores de techo se mueven en sentido horario. Así, se genera una corriente ascendente , de manera que el aire frío sube hasta arriba y desplaza al caliente que se arrastrará por el techo y bajará por las paredes para calentarnos. En este caso, es mejor que el proceso se produzca despacio, por lo que se deben ralentizar las aspas.\n¿Y si no tengo ventilador? Para generar corrientes de aire en casa no es necesario tener un ventilador, aunque obviamente ayuda. Si no podemos o queremos gastar en uno de estos electrodomésticos, la clave está en las ventanas.\nPodemos ventilar la casa abriéndolas durante las primeras horas del día , cuando aún no hace demasiado calor. Lo ideal es buscar la ventilación cruzada, en la que el aire se desplaza de las zonas de alta presión a las de baja presión , generando una corriente que ayuda a refrescar las estancias. Para ello, lo ideal es abrir puertas y ventanas que se encuentren en lados totalmente opuestos de la vivienda.\nLas ventanas se deben abrir estratégicamente para ventilar la casa. Crédito: Jametlene Reskp (Unsplash) Si es posible crear una diagonal entre una ventana y otra, se optimiza mucho más la corriente de aire generada. Además, no debemos abrir las ventanas de cualquier manera. Se recomienda abrir un 20% las que no dan directamente a la calle y un 10% las que dan a la calle completamente. De este modo se consigue que salga la misma cantidad de aire que entra, ya que la apertura de salida es mayor que la de entrada y la velocidad se acelera creando una buena corriente de aire.\nCon estos consejos puede que no tengamos que recurrir a ventiladores de techo. Pero no podemos negar que estos son muy útiles en esta época del año. Si has optado por hacerte con uno, recuerda comprobar que las aspas giran en el sentido adecuado.",

    "text": "San Diego weekend arts events: 'For Dear Life,' Samara Joy and Design Week [Top picks](#top-picks) | [Live music picks](#live-music-picks) | [More art and culture weekend events](#more-art) Top picks 'For Dear Life: Art, Medicine and Disability' Visual art | This first-of-its-kind survey of American art that deals with disability, illness and impairment spans the 1960s through the onset of the COVID-19. The exhibit includes works by Park McArthur, Simone Leigh, Yvonne Rainer (including performance art videos), Howardena Pindell, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Niki de Saint Phalle and dozens more. It's not only a striking collection of significant works of art — it's also an approachable look at the historical and sociological trajectory of disability in America. To learn more, check out my feature on curator Jill Dawsey here: The exhibit opening coincides with MCASD's free third Thursday, and will be open until 8 p.m. with free admission all day — and at 5 p.m. there's a public tour and a dual film screening. [Details](https://www.kpbs.org/events/ongoing/for-dear-life-art-medicine-and-disability): On view Sept. 19, 2024 through Feb. 2, 2025. Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, 700 Prospect St., La Jolla. Free on Sept. 19. Regular admission is $0-$25. Samara Joy Music, Jazz | Three-time Grammy winner Samara Joy recently announced a forthcoming album, \"Portrait,\" and dropped the first single, an enchanting, rhythmic arrangement of \"You Stepped Out of A Dream.\" The young singer will bring her mesmerizing talent (and TikTok fame) to town to lead up to the new release. Her performances and recordings feature not just reimagined jazz standards, but a particular focus on off-the-beaten-path numbers, or crafting new lyrics for instrumental pieces. In [this excellent interview on NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/29/1177940260/grammy-winning-jazz-singer-samara-joy-joins-for-concert-and-conversation), you can hear Joy discussing everything from her musical influences like Sarah Vaughan to her grandparents' gospel choir — plus a handful of performances. [Details](https://www.kpbs.org/events/2024/09/22/samara-joy): 7:30 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 22. California Center for the Arts Escondido, 340 N. Escondido Blvd., Escondido. $42+. World Design Experience: San Diego Design Week Design, Fashion, Music, Food | While San Diego's annual fall Design Week is always a significant gathering of all things design, this year it's a global event. One of the anchor points of our binational region's World Design Capital designation, the week of programming is intended to reflect and celebrate the importance of design in ideas of belonging — particularly in the border region. Design Week features close to 100 programs, panels, tours, exhibitions, performances, culinary events, workshops, film screenings and lectures, spotlighting architecture, visual art and design, gaming, food and drink, animation, industrial design, landscape design, user experience and interface design — to name a few. Events are held across San Diego and Tijuana. Don't miss the [Port of Entry Live](https://sddesignweek.org/programs/port-of-entry-live/) event with our KPBS Port of Entry crew and artist and graphic novelist Charles Glaubitz and actor and filmmaker Giancarlo Ruiz. The discussion, which will take place here in our newly renovated KPBS studios, is from 2-5:30 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 22, and costs $10. Another event on my radar is the Klaman [Africa Vibe Festival](https://sddesignweek.org/programs/africa-vibe-festival/), themed around the origins of textile art in Africa, with a fashion show, arts and crafts for kids, plus an evening event with music from the Gene Perry Afro Salsa Jazz Duo and the Afro Rumba Caribbean Jazz Quintet. It takes place Sept. 21 at UC San Diego Park & Market. $10-$60. [Details](https://sddesignweek.org/programs/): Design Week runs Sept. 19-25. Multiple locations. Prices vary. Vanessa Rishel: 'Safe Haven, Dark Corners' Visual art | Vanessa Rishel's solo exhibit opens this weekend at The Hill Street Country Club in Oceanside. Rishel's style is really captivating: hitting somewhere between fine art's pleasant softness and the quirk and disruption of the anime characters and cherub statues and trinkets she uses has her inspiration — and the grayscale colors. [Details](https://www.kpbs.org/events/2024/09/21/vanessa-rishels-safe-haven-dark-corners-opens-at-hill-street-country-club): Opens with a reception from 12-4 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 21. On view through Nov. 10. The Hill Street Country Club, 530 South Coast Hwy., Oceanside. Free. Salty Series: 'Wave + Energy' Music, Visual art | This month's installment of Project [BLANK]'s experimental performance takeover of Bread and Salt features sound artists and musicians paired with projected video and visual art, or artists creating both sound and visuals. The idea is to create an immersive, sensory experience but also to reframe what each piece — or art form — might mean on its own. Performers and artists include Joe Cantrell, Armando de la Torre, Matty Terrones, Victor Castañeda, Michell Lou and Michael Trigillio. [Details](https://www.kpbs.org/events/2024/09/20/wave-energy): 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 20. Bread and Salt, 1955 Julian Ave., Logan Heights. Sliding scale: $5+. 'Dracula, A Comedy of Terrors' Theater | Gordon Greenberg and Steve Rosen's spin (with many artistic liberties) on Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" comes to spine-tingling life on the Old Globe's stage this weekend, following the adventures of Jean Van Helsing and Count Dracula with plenty of comedy. This is the creative team that has brought us \"Ebenezer Scrooge's BIG San Diego Christmas Show\" as well as \"Crime and Punishment, A Comedy.\" [Details](https://www.kpbs.org/events/ongoing/dracula-a-comedy-of-terrors): On stage Sept. 20 through Oct. 27. The Old Globe, 1363 Old Globe Way, Balboa Park. $98+. Nathalie Miebach: 'Restless Waters' and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: 'Remote Pulse' Visual art | Nathalie Miebach's stunning woven assemblage-style installation, \"Restless Waters\" opens at Institute of Contemporary Art San Diego's Central location this weekend. Also opening is Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's \"Remote Pulse,\" which is a collaboration with Centro Cultural Tijuana (CECUT), where visitors in both locations can interact — transcending space and borders — using pulse-sensing stations. The exhibitions will be the centerpiece of their monthly C You Saturday celebration, with food, music, artmaking and artist talks. From 4-6 p.m., families can make their own Miebach-inspired works of art. Miebach will be on-hand to tour and answer questions at 5 p.m., and DJ Ohmega Watts will provide music. Details: [C You Saturday](https://icasandiego.org/event/c-you-saturday-september-2024/) is 4-8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21. [\"Restless Waters\" and \"Remote Pulse\"](https://www.kpbs.org/events/ongoing/nathalie-miebach-restless-waters-and-rafael-lozano-hemmer-remote-pulse) are on view Sept. 21, 2024 through Jan. 26, 2025. ICA San Diego-Central, 1439 El Prado, Balboa Park. Free/suggested donation. Adams Avenue Street Fair Music | Seventy-five musical acts descend upon Normal Heights this weekend for the free, two-day Adams Avenue Street Fair. There'll be seven stages peppered along Adams Ave., but also hundreds of vendors and carnival-type rides, food and beer gardens. You can find a list of all the bands and set times divided by stage [here](https://www.adamsavenuebusiness.com/adams-avenue-street-fair/music-schedule/). My recommendations: Singer-songwriter Shelbi Bennett (The Havnauts, The Midnight Pine) is doing a solo set with a full band at 7:15 p.m. on Saturday at the Lestat's Indie Stage. And on Sunday, don't miss local pop and R&B star Kahlil Nash at 2:30, also on the Lestat's Indie Stage. [Details](https://www.kpbs.org/events/ongoing/adams-avenue-street-fair-2024): 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 21-22. Adams Ave., between 32nd and 36th St., Normal Heights. Free. 'Helen and Newton Harrison: California Work' Visual art | In addition to MCASD's \"For Dear Life,\" another exhibition project from the Getty's PST: ART initiative will open up this weekend — in multiple locations throughout the county. Ecological, conceptual artists Helen and Newton Harrison are the subjects of this multi-site exhibit, spotlighting 20 projects spanning five decades beginning in the 1960s. Opening receptions are staggered across three sites this weekend. At La Jolla Historical Society, their portion of the exhibit opens with a reception from 5-7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 19. At California Center for the Arts, Escondido, the reception for their exhibition is from 6-8 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 20 (coinciding with their free Música en la Plaza event). Finally, from 12-2 p.m. on Saturday, the exhibit at the San Diego Central Library art gallery will open. Details: On view through Jan. 19, 2025. [La Jolla Historical Society](https://www.lajollahistory.org/helen-and-newton-harrison-california-work), 780 Prospect St., La Jolla; [California Center for the Arts](https://artcenter.org/event/museum-opening-reception-for-helen-and-newton-harrison-california-work/), 340 N.

    "text": "LOGAN - The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources is giving free access for those sportsmen who have a Utah hunting, fishing or combination license to [Cache Valley Public Shooting Range](https://wildlife.utah.gov/cache-valley.html), located at 2851 W. 200 North in Logan on National Hunting and Fishing Day, Saturday, Sept. 28. Interested people can shoot for free at the rifle, handgun and archery facilities on that day. The [Lee Kay Public Shooting Range](https://wildlife.utah.gov/lee-kay.html), located at 6000 W. 2100 South in Salt Lake City, is offering the same opportunities. “Hunters and anglers are the backbone of wildlife conservation in the U.S.,” DWR Director J. Shirley said. “The discounts at these shooting ranges are a small token of our appreciation to hunters and anglers for funding crucial wildlife projects that help maintain healthy populations of a variety of wildlife species in Utah.” To participate in this offer, people need to show a valid Utah hunting, fishing or combination license at the facility on Sept. 28. They can present either a paper or electronic license. People can download and store their electronic licenses via the [Utah Hunting and Fishing app](https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-and-fishing-app.html) DWR is also offering rounds for shooting at half price at the trap and skeet ranges at the facilities that day. “These are some of the best outdoor shooting ranges in Utah, whether you are practicing for an upcoming hunt or you just want to have some fun shooting targets,” DWR Hunter Education, Ranges and Shooting Sports Programs Coordinator Gary Cook said. “We hope you’ll take advantage of this offer and visit our two ranges on National Hunting and Fishing Day.” Both shooting ranges will also offer an ongoing, year-round promotion allowing people to shoot for free or at a discounted rate if they’ve purchased a firearm or archery equipment within 30 days of their visit. Proof of purchase must be provided to qualify for the deal. “We want to promote not only fishing and hunting — which are both family-friendly activities — but also shooting sports in general,” Lee Kay Public Shooting Range Manager Blanche Smith said. “Shooting at the range can be a really fun outing for the whole family. Since our ranges and programs are funded through excise taxes from the purchase of shooting equipment and ammunition, as well as the sale of hunting and fishing licenses, we proudly celebrate National Hunting and Fishing Day as a way to thank those who support us.” [Visit the DWR website](https://wildlife.utah.gov/news/utah-wildlife-news/1712-celebrate-national-shooting-sports-month-at-two-ranges.html) for more details about the amenities offered at each DWR shooting range.

    "text": "2023-12-31 10:01:26\nPublished31. December 2023, 11:01\nForecast: 2024 will be a difficult year, except in Switzerland\nDespite the collapse of Credit Suisse, our country is doing better than other industrialized countries: the Swiss economy is remarkably robust and the unemployment rate remains historically low.\nPixabay\nSwitzerland is a special case that defies all crises, writes the “SonntagsZeitung”. According to experts, the Swiss economy will continue to grow much faster in 2024 than in neighboring countries and also faster than in the United States. Our country has indeed resisted the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19 surprisingly well and is once again experiencing the growth of the pre-pandemic period. Few industrialized countries have achieved this. Lower growth rates are expected next year across the world as a whole.\nIn the United States and the euro zone, inflation and unemployment will also be much higher than in Switzerland in 2024. Central banks are counting on price stabilization at a maximum of 2% next year. This goal has already been achieved in Switzerland: inflation has fallen to 1.4%. Due to rising rents, electricity prices and VAT, this rate will temporarily increase slightly again at the start of the new year, but will remain within the target range of less than 2%.\nHistorically low unemployment rate\nIn the labor market, our country’s strong economy attracts workers. Despite the slowdown in the global economy and strong immigration, most companies complain of a lack of staff. According to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco), the unemployment rate has been fluctuating around the historically low level of 2% since spring 2022. Faced with the shocks of recent years – the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the strength of the franc, the fall of the country’s second bank – the Swiss labor market has demonstrated remarkable robustness.\nRead more: Cryptocurrency prices .. tremors in the crypto market and the bleeding of Bitcoin continues\nThis contrasts sharply with many Western industrialized countries which experience particularly high unemployment rates, for example Spain at 12%, Sweden and Italy at 8%, Finland and France at 7%, the average for all the countries of the European Union are at 6%.\n(cle)\n1704025026\n#Forecast #difficult #year #Switzerland",

    "text": "Esta herramienta permite que los menores no se desmotiven al no ser capaz de entender un tema. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Las herramientas tecnológicas han pasado de ser simples complementos a convertirse en componentes fundamentales del proceso educativo. En particular, el uso de asistentes virtuales, como Alexa, ha demostrado ser una solución eficaz para apoyar a los estudiantes en diversas áreas del conocimiento, entre ellas, las matemáticas.\nAlexa, desarrollada por Amazon, puede interactuar de manera fluida con los usuarios y, mediante configuraciones personalizadas, convertirse en un recurso valioso para los niños que necesitan ayuda adicional en sus estudios.\nGracias a su capacidad para realizar cálculos, responder preguntas y guiar a los estudiantes a través de ejercicios , hace que aprender esta materia sea una experiencia más dinámica y accesible, desde la comodidad del hogar.\nCómo activar habilidades educativas en Alexa\nEl asistente cuenta con características enfocadas en diferentes usuarios. (Foto: EFE/ Alicia Pérez) Uno de los aspectos más útiles de Alexa es la amplia variedad de o “skills” que pueden descargarse y activarse , lo que expande las capacidades del dispositivo más allá de sus funciones predeterminadas.\nEn el caso de las matemáticas, existen varias habilidades diseñadas específicamente para ayudar a los estudiantes de diferentes niveles a comprender conceptos y practicar ejercicios. Algunas de las más populares incluyen:\nSkill de Math Practice: Ideal para estudiantes de primaria, esta habilidad permite a los niños practicar sumas, restas, multiplicaciones y divisiones de forma interactiva. Skill de Smart Math: Perfecta para estudiantes de secundaria, esta habilidad cubre temas más avanzados como álgebra y geometría. Skill de 1-2-3 Math: Pensada para niños en etapa preescolar o los primeros años de educación básica, utiliza juegos y canciones para introducir conceptos matemáticos básicos como contar o reconocer números. Para activar estas habilidades , hay que decir “Alexa, abre [nombre de la habilidad]”, o buscar la habilidad en la app de Alexa, y activarla manualmente.\nCómo crear rutinas personalizadas para el estudio\nEsta estrategia ayuda al niño a ser mejor estudiante. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Alexa permite crear rutinas personalizadas que pueden ayudar a un niño a establecer un hábito de estudio regular. Es decir, se puede programar a Alexa para que, a una hora específica cada día, le recuerde a su hijo que es tiempo de practicar matemáticas. Este tipo de rutinas puede incluir recordatorios personalizados como:\n“Es hora de tu lección de matemáticas, abre Smart Math para empezar a practicar”. “No olvides resolver los problemas de matemáticas que te dejó la maestra hoy”. También, se pueden configurar temporizadores para sesiones de estudio. Al implementar la técnica Pomodoro, que consiste en estudiar durante 25 minutos y descansar 5 minutos, Alexa puede gestionar los tiempos y avisar al pequeño cuando deba hacer una pausa.\nCómo preguntarle a Alexa\nCada función se activa con un patrón específico. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) El asistente virtual tiene la capacidad de responder a preguntas matemáticas rápidas sin necesidad de activar ninguna habilidad especial. Cuando un niño está resolviendo una operación aritmética simple, puede decir:\n“Alexa, ¿cuánto es 23 por 7?” “Alexa, ¿cuál es la raíz cuadrada de 144?” Esta función puede ser muy útil para que el menor verifique rápidamente sus respuestas , o para obtener ayuda inmediata cuando esté atascado en un problema.\nCómo un niño puede jugar con Alexa\nLos espacios de esparcimiento también son necesarios en el proceso de aprendizaje. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) El aprendizaje a través del juego es una de las mejores formas de motivar a los niños a practicar matemáticas , sin sentir que están haciendo una tarea aburrida. Alexa ofrece varios juegos interactivos entretenidos y formativos.\nMatemáticas con Superhéroes: En este juego, los niños ayudan a un superhéroe a resolver problemas matemáticos para avanzar en la historia. Desafío de matemáticas: Un juego en el que se presentan preguntas matemáticas con límite de tiempo. Asimismo, esta tecnología puede ser una gran aliada para la organización de las tareas escolares de los niños, especialmente en lo que respecta a las que se les dificultan. Al usar la función adecuada, es posible crear una lista con los ejercicios o tareas pendientes a revisar.",
