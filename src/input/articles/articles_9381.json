    "text": "Haberes El Gobierno confirmó el pago de los bonos pendientes para jubilados: cuándo los cobran Se trata de los dos pagos pendientes de 55.000 pesos para aquellos que cobran la mínima. Todavía resta que se estipulen las fechas de pago. El Gobierno decidió que pagará, en enero y en febrero, los dos bonos pendientes por 55.000 pesos cada uno a los jubilados que cobren el haber mínimo. El anuncio llega en medio de la decisión del Gobierno de Javier Milei de eliminar la actual fórmula de cálculo de movilidad jubilatoria, que momentáneamente sería reemplazada por aumentos por decreto para los jubilados. En diciembre se pagó el último bono de 55.000 pesos correspondiente a la gestión del exministro Sergio Massa, y desde entonces no hubo precisiones sobre qué pasaría con ese refuerzo en enero y febrero.

    "title": "Short Rib Ragu",
    "text": "Get 5 Secrets to Make Homemade Taste Food Better + New Recipes Weekly!\nPublished September 19, 2024.\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read my\ndisclosure policy.\nThis chunky Short Rib Ragu is a delicious beef gravy with incredible tomato, vegetable, and herb flavors for the ultimate Italian sauce. My family has become addicted to this sauce and love it with pasta.\nI love all the different Italian sauces because they’re always flavorful and easy to make. You must try my\nBolognese or Authentic Alfredo Sauce if you’re the same.\nShort Rib Ragu\nShort rib ragu, or ragù di cossolette di manzo in Italian, is a classic sauce recipe for braised short ribs in a flavorful tomato and beef stock liquid with herbs and vegetables. The result is a fork-tender meat sauce that is incredibly flavorful. It can be served directly over polenta, with gnocchi, or with\npasta.\nThis type of sauce, or gravy, would be a typical “Sunday sauce” due to its several-hour cooking process. The longer this sauce cooks and sits, the more flavorful it will become, as the ingredients will have ample time to marry. I don’t often say this, but I’m willing to share that this is one of my top five favorite all-time sauces.\nIngredients and Substitutions\n- Beef – Bone-in or boneless short ribs can be used for this recipe.\n- Onions – Yellow, white, or sweet onions can be used. In addition, you’ll need some whole garlic cloves.\n- Vegetables – The classical vegetables are carrots and celery. You could also add other root vegetables, such as rutabaga or parsnips.\n- Herbs — I used a combination of bay leaves, parsley, thyme, and rosemary. As long as you use bay leaves, you may use any combination of the other herbs.\n- Tomatoes — For this recipe, you can use crushed, whole, peeled tomatoes that have been hand-crushed, diced, or pureed.\n- Stock –\nBeef stockor brodois best to use.\n- Wine – Any dry red wine such as merlot or chianti is good.\n- Tomato Paste – A little tomato paste will add a lot of body, umami flavors, and help to thicken the sauce.\n- Lemon – Juice from a lemon is added to the sauce at the end to make it more delicious.\n- Pork – This is optional, but I used pancetta in this ragu which I then seared the beef in the rendered pork fat. You can also use guanciale or pork belly.\nHow to Make Short Rib Ragu\nCook the pancetta in a large rondeau pot over low to medium heat until the fat is rendered. Set the crispy lardons to the side.\nPat dry the short ribs on all sides and then season with salt and pepper.\nPlace the short ribs into the pot fat cap side down and cook over medium heat and brown well on all sides, which takes about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set them to the side.\nStir in the onions, gently season with salt, and cook for 5 minutes or until they start to turn brown. Then, turn the heat down to low and cook for 10 minutes while occasionally stirring.\nMix in the carrots and celery, add on a lid, and sweat over low heat for 10 minutes.\nAdd in the garlic and cook just until fragrant, which takes 30 to 45 seconds.\nStir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until it turns a rust color.\nDeglaze with red wine and cook over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes to reduce and concentrate the wine flavors.\nPour in the tomato puree, beef stock, herbs, cooked pancetta salt, and pepper, and mix to combine.\nPlace in the short ribs, add on a lid and cook over low heat for 2 ½ to 3 hours or until the beef is fork tender.\nRemove the herbs and bones from the short ribs in pan. Break up the beef in the sauce using two forks or a large spoon.\nGarnish with optional finely minced fresh parsley and try serving with pasta.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nMake-Ahead: For freshness, you can make this up to 2 days ahead\nHow to Store: Cover and keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days. You can freeze it covered for up to 6 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator for 1 day before reheating.\nHow to Reheat: Add the desired amount of ragu to a medium-sized saucepot and heat over low heat until hot. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.\nChef Notes + Tips\n- The combination of onions, celery, and carrots in Italian is known as sofrito.\n- Patting dry the beef helps it to brown better when searing.\n- Searing the beef until it forms a dark brown crust will add exceptional flavors to the ragu.\n- If the pan is smoking too much when searing the beef, turn the heat down so that the rendered fat doesn’t burn.\nMore Beef Recipes\nIngredients\n- 4 ounces medium-diced pancetta, about ½ cup\n- 3 pounds bone-in short ribs\n- 1 large, small-diced yellow onion, about 2 cups\n- 3 peeled medium-sized small diced carrots\n- 3 small diced ribs of celery\n- 8 smashed garlic cloves\n- 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n- 2 cups dry red wine\n- 28 ounces tomato puree\n- 3 cups\nbeef stock\n- 2 fresh rosemary sprigs\n- 2-4 fresh thyme sprigs\n- 2-4 fresh parsley sprigs\n- 2 bay leaves\n- coarse salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste\nInstructions\n- Cook the pancetta in a large rondeau pot over low to medium heat until the fat is rendered. Set the crispy lardons to the side.\n- Pat dry the short ribs on all sides, then season with salt and pepper.\n- Place the short ribs into the pot, fat cap side down, and cook over medium heat and brown well on all sides, which takes about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set them to the side.\n- Stir in the onions, gently season with salt, and cook for 5 minutes or until they start to turn brown. Then, turn the heat down to low and cook for 10 minutes while occasionally stirring.\n- Mix in the carrots and celery, add on a lid, and sweat over low heat for 10 minutes.\n- Add the garlic and cook just until fragrant, which takes 30 to 45 seconds.\n- Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until it turns a rust color.\n- Deglaze with red wine and cook over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes to reduce and concentrate the wine flavors.\n- Pour in the tomato puree, beef stock, herbs, cooked pancetta salt, and pepper, and mix to combine.\n- Place in the short ribs, add on a lid and cook over low heat for 2 ½ to 3 hours or until the beef is fork tender.\n- Remove the herbs and bones from the short ribs in pan.

    "title": "Global Robotic Vacuum Cleaner Market Will Triple Expected To Reach USD 50.65 Billion by 2028",
    "text": "The global robot vacuum cleaner market has been projected to increase by more than 300% in just eight years.\nIn 2020, the global robot vacuum cleaner market was estimated at over $9 billion. In just one year, the value increased by more than 22 percent to hit $11.97 billion and is projected to hit a staggering $50 billion by 2028 (\nsource). There are a number of reasons for this spectacular growth in the industry. First, there has been a sharp rise in the demand for robot vacuum cleaners around the globe. In 2015, there were just 3 million units that were shipped globally, but in 2024, the number has jumped to over 19 million units ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/1022967/worldwide-robotic-vacuum-cleaner-shipment/).\nThis points to one fact: more people want to use robot vacuum cleaners for their cleaning. The major forces driving this demand are the need for ease and convenience that come with using these smart vacuums. Moreover, the increasing penetration of high-speed internet globally and the proliferation of smartphone usage have significantly contributed to this surge, allowing users to control their vacuum cleaners from anywhere, anytime. Besides, if we have automated writing, speaking, and even driving, why can we not automate cleaning our own homes?\nSecond, the smart home ecosystem is booming like never before. In the US alone, about 70 million households are using smart home devices actively in 2024 (\nhttps://www.oberlo.com/statistics/smart-home-statistics).\nThis increased demand for smart home devices has set the stage for a rapid growth of the robot vacuum cleaner market. The integration of these devices with home automation systems has become a pivotal factor in enhancing consumer lifestyle, thereby accelerating the adoption rate of smart vacuum cleaners. Coupled with the rise of voice assistant technologies such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, controlling these devices has never been easier. Since smart vacuum cleaners come equipped to work with smart features such as voice command, app setup, and security cameras, the odds are that this market will keep rising for a very long time.\nFurthermore, competition promotes innovation. In a market as highly fragmented as the robot vacuum cleaner market, key players like\nECOVACS are working overtime to improve the technology of their products. Innovations such as battery life extension, improved suction power, and the ability to navigate complex home layouts are being introduced, making these devices more appealing to the end-user. Newer models are also capable of emptying their dust bins automatically, providing an even more hands-off cleaning experience. From precise mapping technology to integration of mopping and vacuuming, to more compact designs suitable for corners and hard-to-reach surfaces in the home, smart vacuum cleaner manufacturers keep advancing their tech to make cleaning easier and more convenient for their customers.\nIn the end, the goal of automation is to make life easy for consumers so they can spend time doing things they really love to do. It is not just about saving time; it’s about enhancing the quality of life by reducing the mundane tasks that can be otherwise managed by smart technologies. This aligns with the broader trend towards smart living, where every aspect of home management is optimized for efficiency and comfort.\nEven though there are still some restraining factors, such as security concerns around the hacking of smart home devices, these challenges are not stopping the industry’s growth; rather, they are serving as catalysts for continuous improvement. Manufacturers are increasingly focusing on enhancing the security features of their devices, incorporating end-to-end encryption and secure authentication methods to protect user data. These challenges would push smart vacuum developers to improve the security and overall technology in the market. Hence, while challenges exist, the trajectory for the robot vacuum cleaner market looks promising, underpinned by relentless innovation and a growing consumer appetite for smart, efficient home cleaning solutions. The future of home cleaning lies in the hands of these intelligent devices, transforming the chore into a seamless, automated task.\nPublished by: Nelly Chavez",

    "title": "Putin Culpa Ucrânia E Acusa País Por Tentativa De Bombardeio Em Kursk",
    "text": "Vladimir Putin, presidente da Rússia, acusou o governo ucraniano de ameaça à segurança ao tentar bombardear a usina nuclear de Kursk, no dia 6 de agosto em uma ofensiva da capital ucraniana, Kiev. Durante uma reunião transmitida por uma emissora estatal russa, o presidente Putin aparece ao lado de membros governamentais e afirma, sem provas, que “a nação inimiga tentou atacar” a região durante a noite. Ataque à usina Segundo a Agência Internacional de Energia Atômica (AIEA), ela “teria sido informada” e prometeu enviar especialistas para avaliar a situação. O local do suposto ataque fica a 50km dos combates entre as tropas militares russas e ucranianas e, receberá a visita na próxima semana de Rafael Grossi, diretor da AIEA. Em contrapartida, a Ucrânia nega totalmente a suposta tentativa de ataque à usina. O chefe do departamento de combate à desinformação dentro do Conselho de Segurança Nacional e Defesa do país, Andrii Kovalenko, declarou que “o cenário que a o governo quer, onde forças militares ucranianas atam a usina de Kursk e são acusadas de terrorismo nuclear, não ocorreu” e sugeriu, ainda, que a própria Rússia poderia ter inventado essa provocação para chamar atenção em nível internacional, mas não apresentou provas. Conflito nuclear Desde o início do conflito entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia, ambas as nações tem se acusado mutuamente de ameaçar a segurança nuclear e nacional. Em seus primeiros dias de ofensiva militar, o governo russo tomou uma base de energia abandonada em Chernobyl, no norte ucraniano e também a usina de Zaporíjia. E, no início de agosto, foi registrado um incêndio em uma das torres de resfriamento na usina de Zaporíjia e, embora autoridades locais e a agência nuclear da ONU tenham afirmado que não houve ou há risco de acidente, as capitais Moscou e Kiev trocaram suposições sobre quem estaria responsável pelo incêndio. Em contraste com as acusações, Putin sofre críticas pela falta de transparência em suas declarações ao público sobre a gravidade da ofensiva ucraniana, uma vez que o governador de Kursk afirmou que 133 mil pessoas precisaram fugir ou serem retiradas dos distritos fronteiriços desde que a Ucrânia iniciou sua ofensiva.

    "text": "(Teleborsa) - Non è giusto penalizzare migliaia di consumatori che hanno scelto gli stabilimenti balneari italiani per le loro vacanze, riconoscendone qualità e funzionalità. Per questo migliaia di aziende associate ad Assobalneari e La Base Balneare con Donnedamare, le organizzazioni maggiormente rappresentative degli operatori balneari italiani, si asterranno dallo sciopero convocato da alcune sigle sindacali per venerdì 9 agosto\". Lo annunciano Fabrizio Licordari, presidente di Assobalneari e Bettina Bolla, presidente di La Base Balneare con Donnedamare. Lo sciopero è proclamato dai sindacati di categoria Sib Confcommercio e Fib Confesercenti con la chiusura simbolica degli ombrelloni per le prime due ore della mattina. Secondo Licordari e Bolla, \"la via maestra per individuare una soluzione in grado di mettere ordine nel settore resta quella di sostenere la validità della mappatura fatta dal governo italiano, difendendola da attacchi immotivati e ideologici\". \"Bene. Ottima notizia. Non possiamo che condividere la motivazione\" lo afferma Massimiliano Dona, presidente dell'Unione Nazionale Consumatori. Lo afferma Massimiliano Dona, presidente dell'Unione Nazionale Consumatori, commentando in una nota l'annuncio che Assobalneari si asterrà dallo sciopero degli ombrelloni di domani, ritenendo ingiusto penalizzare migliaia di consumatori. \"Per essere più precisi, con lo sciopero i consumatori sarebbero danneggiati due volte. Una prima volta perché la mancanza di concorrenza e le concessioni bloccate hanno consentito, in questi anni, rincari ingiustificati rispetto alla qualità del servizio offerto, una seconda volta perché dopo il danno ora subirebbero pure la beffa di perdere pure due ore di spiaggia. Sembra poco, ma non lo è, considerato che le vacanze oggi non durano più come una volta l'intero mese di agosto, ma sono sempre più brevi, per far fronte al caro vita\" prosegue Dona. \"Secondo gli ultimi dati Istat, il 49,6% delle vacanze lunghe dura meno di una settimana. Insomma, due ore in meno, come dice giustamente Assobalneari, penalizzerebbe i consumatori, che, ribadiamo, dovranno comunque essere indennizzati per il disservizio causato dallo sciopero, con un giorno di spiaggia gratis\" conclude Dona. .",

    "text": "Turning the Tide: Coast Guard uses old whale-hunting tactic to save WA orcas BELLINGHAM, Wash. - Conservationists report only 73 Southern Resident Killer Whales still call the Salish Sea home. Concerned by the subtype's waning numbers and the rising risk of oil spills, a Coast Guard Lieutenant out of Bellingham reached out to local advocacy group, Orca Conservancy. When a ship goes down and a sheen is seen on the surface, the Coast Guard is first on scene. Crews could build a perimeter and call for reinforcement, but they had no means of protecting pods from the polluted area. With Orca Conservancy's guidance, Station Bellingham is now testing out a technique once employed by hunters to corral whales and dolphins as a means of protecting these beloved apex predators. Rising risks in crowded waters This summer, several oil slicks have been reported in the San Juan Islands, waters frequented by both transient and resident orcas. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a stark warning that a single oil spill could have dire consequences for the Southern Residents, because they are such a small and social group. \"They’re very vulnerable,\" said Tamara Kelley with Orca Conservancy. \"They already have a lot of things working against them that an oil spill could really be a great disaster to this community.\" Kelley says a pod of killer whales that swam through the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 is almost extinct. She says oil exposure has long-lasting effects. Surge in shipping traffic Compounding the problem, Puget Sound is getting more crowded. Shipping traffic in the Strait of Juan de Fuca is expected to increase seven-fold over the next several years. Lt. Terrell Sisk with the U.S. Coast Guard says so far this summer he's only responded to spills caused by smaller private vessels, but he fears for the worst. \"I don’t want to be doom and gloom, worst case scenario, but sometimes we think about that,\" shared Lt. Sisk. \"The tankers that go through these waters, the bigger ships that go through these waters, what happens if one of them has a bad day?\" NOAA reports there are more \"mega vessels\" on the water than ever before. The Washington State Department of Ecology estimates a single container barge can carry anywhere between 1.5 and 2 million gallons of oil. Coast Guard's innovative approach Looking to get more involved in his Bellingham community and protect local marine life, Lt. Sisk reached out to the Orca Conservancy. Kelley shared she was pleasantly surprised by his outreach. The two agencies, which have been collaborating on a plan since February, finally had the opportunity to test it out this summer. \"Pollution is going to be a risk at all times, so we’re getting ahead of it,\" said Lt. Sisk. The Coast Guard has a few approved methods of chasing wildlife away, which includes hazing from helicopters and underwater fireworks. \"But the optics of throwing bombs towards endangered animals is not good, plus it can actually pose risk,\" said Kelley, \"whereas the Oikomi pipes don’t really risk harming them, it's more of a nuisance disturbance, like nails on a chalk board.\" Implementing the Oikomi pipes First developed in Japan, Oikomi pipes or ‘banging pipes’ were originally used to harm marine life. If you hit one of them above water with a hammer, it creates a harsh chime, but under the water, the sound amplifies. Multiple boats hitting multiple pipes can create a wall of sound disruptive to these acoustic animals. \"They used them to corral dolphins into coves to harvest them or also sell them to marine parks,\" explained Kelley. \"It's just a yucky sound that they will likely want to avoid.\" Within the last decade, agencies like NOAA have supported using them to choo away orcas from spills, but this is the first for the Coast Guard, who are most often first on scene. Lt. Sisk admits at first he was hesitant, but has since changed his tune. \"Its like striking a bell on a ship or a boat,\" explained Lt. Sisk. \"It's quite painless putting a pipe on here, connecting it to the boat and hitting it with a hammer.\" He and his crew have fastened a pipe to one of their vessels. On Wednesday, the admiral from Seattle came up to try out the tactic himself. \"The Admiral being here kind of just shows the support,\" said Lt. Sisk. \"This is kind of a win-win all around that came together.\" Kelley hopes they can continue to work alongside the Coast Guard with the goal of expanding this initiative to other bases in the region, providing comprehensive coverage across the Salish Sea and Washington State.

    "title": "ITMO Physicists Simplify Thin Film Anodization for Allergy Diagnostics",
    "text": "Anodization is a method of creating thin films of anodic aluminum oxide on the surface of optical elements. Such films have several advantages over the dielectric films currently used in optics: thanks to the residual aluminum layer beneath the oxide film, the spectral range in which optical elements can be used becomes wider, ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. This property is useful for creating beam splitters – devices that split light beams in laser systems, spectral devices, and interferometers.\nWith anodization, the surface of optical elements is also protected from scratches, while the luminescence of various objects increases inside the oxide’s pores and on its surface. The latter effect can be used to diagnose allergies: they are indicated by elevated immunoglobulin levels in the blood; if aluminum layers are taught to catch immunoglobulin, then the changed luminescence levels can be a way to diagnose this condition.\nTypically, researchers use foil to acquire anodic aluminum oxide films – this way, the films turn out consistent and have a minimal number of defects. However, the process requires a lot of time and resources: first, the foil has to be cleaned, polished in a solution using electricity, and calcined at 600 degrees Celsius in order to remove all of the imperfections and stresses in the metal. After that, the foil is placed into an electrolyte with another electrode and connected to a current. In total, the anodization takes seven hours and results in a thin film of anodic aluminum oxide on the substrate.\nAccording to Igor Nikitin, the paper’s first author and a research engineer at the Center of Optical Information Technologies, there is an alternative anodization method that doesn’t involve complex manipulations with the foil: coating a substrate with a thin film in a vacuum chamber with subsequent anodization.\n“This method is faster, but it hasn’t been popular because many parameters can affect the speed of anodization, including the temperature and acidity of the electrolyte, as well as its flow rate through the electrochemical cell. When we are talking about micron thicknesses of the oxide film, the influence of these factors isn’t as noticeable, but when the films are hundreds of nanometers thin, it becomes significant. At the same time, it doesn’t really help to control for voltage or current because the anodization parameters change in each case. That’s why I thought that if we need structures with specific optical properties, we should monitor them specifically. With our method, it’s possible to control the anodization process based on the refraction coefficient of the aluminum film on a substrate with an oxide layer on the surface. We can stop the process when the oxide layer reaches a certain thickness – the refraction coefficient will fall to a specified value. Apart from adding this increased control capacity of the film’s optical properties, we have accelerated the process: instead of it taking seven hours, I can now grow a 160 nm-thick anodic aluminum oxide film in just two minutes,” explains Igor Nikitin.\nCommonly, inorganic electrolytes are used for anodization, but the team from ITMO chose the organic oxalic acid instead. The substance’s components entered the film’s structure, producing luminescence centers that can transfer energy to other luminescent objects, thus multiplying their glow. This feature can be used in biosensors and immunoluminometric analysis – for instance, to diagnose allergies.\n“Back in the day, clinicians would test for allergies by making small cuts on a patient’s skin and applying droplets of allergens onto them; if there was a reaction, it identified an allergy. Now, immunoluminometric analysis is used instead: a patient’s biosample, such as blood, is put on a substrate and illuminated by a laser; based on its response, the doctor can tell if there is an allergy. The issue is that the luminescent response is hard to see with the naked eye without advanced photodetectors, which is why the substrate is enriched with gold or silver nanoparticles – and this makes diagnostics quite expensive. Thin anodic aluminum oxide films are a more affordable amplifier. Their luminescence centers transfer energy to organic molecules, which start glowing five times more intensely. This would make it easier for the doctor to detect an allergic reaction without causing any discomfort to the patient,” says Igor Nikitin.\nAdditionally, the new method can be used to create thin films for simple and inexpensive beam splitters with a specific intensity ratio of the separated beams, as well as solar cells. Currently, solar cells use a coating of indium-tin oxide, which allows light to enter the cell while also conducting charge via its semiconductor layer. In the future, the expensive oxide of rare earth metals could be replaced with more affordable structures based on thin anodic aluminum oxide films.\nNext, the researchers are planning to redesign the electrochemical cell in order to control the temperature, acidity, and flow rate of the electrolyte, which are important anodization factors. This will allow them to control even more of the process.\nThis project is supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant No. 23-72-00045).",
