    "title": "Texas measles outbreak up to 58: Which states have reported measles cases in 2025? See map",
    "text": "As Texas continues to contend with a growing measles outbreak that has sickened 58 and counting, other states have begun reporting their own cases of the highly contagious disease.Two other states, New Mexico and Georgia, have also reached \"outbreak\" status as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, meaning they have reported three or more related cases of the disease.But with the CDC only updating case numbers monthly, the task of tracking and announcing the spread has fallen to individual states in the weeks between.The Texas Department of State Health Services announced Tuesday that confirmed infections were up to 58, mostly in children. All but four case involve unvaccinated people or people with unknown vaccination status, and most occurred in far West Texas in Gaines County, which has a 17.62% rate of vaccine exemptions in K-12 students, according to 2023-2024 state data. In New Mexico, the number is up to nine, the New Mexico Department of Health confirmed to USA TODAY Thursday, all in Lea County, which is just across from the Texas state line and Gaines County. Four of those infected are under the age of 18 and unvaccinated, while the other five are adults, also of unvaccinated or unknown vaccination status, reported the Las Cruces Sun News, part of the USA TODAY Network.Meanwhile Georgia officials confirmed to USA TODAY on Thursday that the state still has three confirmed cases. The Rhode Island health department says the state has one case, while Alaska confirmed the state has two.Other states have reported cases but have not updated numbers in days or weeks and did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for confirmation Thursday. These include New Jersey , which confirmed one case on Feb. 14, and New York, where one case was reported by the CDC as part of its last update on Feb. 7.Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease caused by a virus that primarily, and most severely, affects children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , it infects the respiratory tract before spreading throughout the body.The virus is highly contagious; so contagious, in fact, that 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed end up contracting it. Additionally, one in five of those people end up hospitalized, according to the CDC.Measles is spread through contact with infected nasal or throat secretions, according to WHO. It is airborne and most commonly spread through actions like coughing, sneezing or breathing. The measles virus can remain contagious in the air or on contaminated surfaces for up to two hours. According to the CDC , measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus and typically include high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Measles rash appears three to five days after the onset of the first symptoms. Other signs and symptoms of measles include: Contributing: Janet Loehrke , USA TODAY",

    "title": "Forever Cheer picks Hong Kong as gateway for global launch of pain management drugs with an eye on US$88.2 billion market",
    "text": "Forever Cheer Holding, a biotech company founded by Zhuo Min, a mainland-China-born neuroscientist who teaches at the University of Toronto, has picked Hong Kong as the base for global expansion with an eye on the chronic pain management market. The plan is in sync with the city’s ambition of establishing itself as an international biotech hub.\nThe global market for such products is projected to grow to US$173.4 billion by 2033 from the current US$88.2 billion, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent, according to the New York-based research company Market.us.\n“We see the city as the gateway to the international market,” said Ted Chang Zongming, chairman and CEO of Forever Cheer, in an interview with the Post. The company’s goal is to establish a strong presence in China and “connect the city to the global stage as they bring their breakthrough therapies to patients worldwide”, Chang said.\nThe company, headquartered in Hong Kong since 2015, has offices and production bases in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingdao and Ningbo in mainland China.\nIts Fujian-born founder Zhuo Min moved to the United States in the 1980s and is now a neuroscience professor at the University of Toronto. The biotech start-up specialises in discovering new therapeutic targets within neuroscience research and developing first-in-class drugs which are prototype drugs that use new, unique ways to treat a particular medical condition.\nThe company is developing drugs targeting the inhibition of Adenylate Cyclase for both human and animal use. These drugs are currently undergoing various stages of clinical trials and have shown positive results in treating chronic pain without significant side effects or addiction risks, according to Zhuo, who is also the company’s chief scientist.\nThe pain management market potential was highlighted by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer’s acquisition of Biohaven last year for US$11.6 billion. Pfizer said Biohaven’s migraine drugs could top $6 billion in annual sales at their peak.\nIn the first half of 2025, the company expects to complete phase two clinical trials of NB001, a drug used to alleviate pain for late stage cancer patients, in China. Before launching the drug for humans, the company will start producing drugs for the treatment of chronic pain in dogs in China next year.\nScientists say the management of chronic pain currently involves opioid analgesics, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants but long-term usage has negative side-effects like diversion and addiction.\nSelective adenylyl cyclase type 1 inhibitors could serve as potential alternatives for chronic pain management, Val J Watts, a professor of molecular pharmacology at Purdue University, said in a 2018 article in the Nature Journal.\n“The drugs can replace the existing cancer pain analgesics on the market and meet the current huge clinical demand for cancer pain treatment,” said Zhuo.\nPreliminary data suggests these drugs are effective, presenting no significant side effects or risk of addiction, he said.\nForever Cheer holds over 10 global patents, covering various fields such as pain management, drug addiction, anxiety, and depression, with patent protection in major countries and regions worldwide. To support its research and development efforts, Forever Cheer has recently established its R&D headquarters in Hong Kong’s Science Park.",

    "title": "Santiago registró más de 2.300 horas de sol en 2023, la segunda marca más alta del siglo XXI",
    "text": "Las horas de sol medidas en [Santiago](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/tags/santiago/) superaron las 2.300 a lo largo de 2023, lo que supone la marca más alta de este siglo solo superada por el registro de 2017 (2.351). Así lo constata el 'Resumen meteorológico del año 2023 de la ciudad de Santiago de Compostela', elaborado con los datos obtenidos en la estación del Observatorio Astronómico Ramón María Aller de la USC, centro colaborador de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología. Según ha trasladado la USC, el informe también destaca que la lluvia recogida a lo largo del año superó los 2.000 litros por metro cuadrado, después de ocho años sin hacerlo, mientras que la temperatura máxima fueron los 36'2 grados alcanzados el 8 de agosto, mes en el que también se superó la barrera de los 30 en otras cuatro ocasiones. En julio la temperatura máxima quedó en los 28'2 grados. Lluvias En relación con las lluvias, el resumen destaca que en 2023 sucedió algo semejante a lo ocurrido en el año anterior: en los tres últimos meses cayeron más de 1.000 litros/m2, superando la media de las últimas décadas. Así, a última hora, el año que acaba de finalizar dejó 2.009,2 litros/m2, de los que 1.000,5 corresponden a los tres últimos meses: octubre con 424,3 l/m2, noviembre con 318,7 l/m2, y diciembre con 257,5 l/m2. Tal y como subraya José Ángel Docobo, director del Observatorio de la USC, \"llovió la misma cantidad en los nueve primeros meses que en los tres últimos\". En este sentido, el profesor destaca que en meses tradicionalmente lluviosos en Santiago como abril y mayo, \"la precipitación recogida fue modesta\", sin llegar a 100 litros/m2 en cada uno de ellos. El día más lluvioso del año resultó ser el 18 de octubre con 71,1 l/m2. En concreto, en esa jornada \"ocurrió un fenómeno inusual\", relata el profesor Docobo, cuando sobre las 19,00 horas se recogieron unos 30 litros/m2 en media hora. \"En total fueron 22 las jornadas en las que se midieron más de 30 litros/m2\", detalla. En cuanto al número de días con precipitación, llegaron a los 192 (52,6%), si bien en 26 de ellos fue inferior a 0,1 l/m2, \"lo que en meteorología se considera una cantidad inapreciable\", indica Docobo. Sin contar estos últimos, los 166 restantes corresponden al 45,4% de los días en los que en algún momento hubo precipitación, lo cual entra en la normalidad de los registros de la capital gallega, que ronda siempre el 50%. Temperaturas Durante las trece jornadas en las que la ciudad de Santiago pasó de los 30º, en cinco ocasiones en las que esto sucedió fueron en octubre, que concretamente el día 7 marcó la quinta máxima del año con 32'3. Por el contrario, solo se bajó de los cero grados en tres días, resultando la mínima absoluta del año los -0'2 compartidos entre el 2 de marzo y el 17 de diciembre. Junto con los -0'1 del 18 de diciembre, estas tres fueron las únicas jornadas con temperatura negativa en todo el año 2023. Asimismo, el día con la temperatura máxima más baja resultó ser el 17 de enero con solo 8'5, mientras que la noche más cálida correspondió al 10 de agosto, cuando los termómetros no bajaron de los 18'5. Agosto con 20'9 de temperatura media fue el mes más caliente, seguido de junio (19'8), julio (19'4) y septiembre (19'3). Sobre la insolación, fueron importantes las contribuciones de los meses de mayo (291 horas y 40 minutos) junto con los meses estivales. En abril y septiembre la insolación fue la misma: 220 horas. Solo hubo 38 días en los que el sol no salió en Compostela, pero entre abril y septiembre solo hubo dos jornadas sin Sol, una en abril y otra en julio. Destacan los 18 días con más de nueve horas de insolación en mayo y los 22 días de febrero en los que el Sol se dejó ver entre 6 y 9 horas.",

    "title": "The Rise of io.net: Decentralizing AI Compute",
    "text": "In the 19th century, the California Gold Rush completely reshaped the United States as prospectors flocked to the region in search of riches. Today, a new kind of gold rush is underway: the rush for computing power to fuel the AI revolution. At the heart of this whirlwind stands\nNVIDIA, whose stock price surged 239% in 2023 as demand for its GPUs (graphics processing units) skyrocketed.\nOn the other hand, centralized cloud giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, whose combined $6 Trillion market cap has benefited greatly from the high demand for cloud services, are struggling to keep up with the insatiable demand for AI compute (computational power), leading to high prices, long wait times, and limited options for\nAI startups and innovators.\nEnter io.net, a decentralized cloud compute provider which has achieved a $1 billion private market valuation and raised $40 million from various venture capital firms, showcasing significant market confidence in both its vision and the scalability of its network since its launch in November 2023.\nHere, we discuss the decentralization and accessibility of the AI compute market by io.net, its technological and economic innovations, and plans for market expansion.\nMarket Disruption\nio.net is on a mission to disrupt the AI compute market through decentralization. The centerpiece is the IO Cloud, a permissionless, distributed network of GPUs and CPUs (central processing units) that anyone can tap into on-demand without long-term contracts or KYC.\nDevelopers can quickly deploy ML clusters, while hardware providers earn rewards for contributing compute to the network. The result is a more accessible, flexible, and cost-effective alternative to big-box centralized cloud behemoths.\nThe Birth of Digital Oil and $IO, the Currency of Compute\nio.net was born out of necessity. In 2020, founder Ahmad Shadid was building quantitative trading systems and ran into the common roadblock of high GPU costs from existing providers. So, he built his own distributed GPU network to cut expenses.\nAfter the ChatGPT launch, Shadid realized the opportunity to bring this network architecture to the broader market. A few months and a Solana hackathon victory later, io.net officially launched.\nThe IO Cloud already boasts an impressive 300,000 GPUs and 40,000 CPUs distributed globally. Crypto partners, like Filecoin, Render, and Gaimin, have surfaced their own GPU networks to the IO Cloud to take advantage of io.net’s self-service cluster virtualization and\nAI-ready orchestration layer.\nHow It Works\nAccessing compute is simple through the intuitive dashboard at cloud.io.net. Here, developers can view stats, manage clusters, and track network performance. Hardware providers can also monitor their machines and earnings.\nUnder the hood, the io.net stack is powered by the IO-SDK and a specialized fork of Ray, the same open-source network architecture used by OpenAI and Uber. The modular architecture is designed for reliability and flexibility while scaling up parallel processing capabilities to handle AI/ML workloads. APIs enable connectivity while the infrastructure layer handles core functions like GPU provisioning, monitoring, and ML ops. This layered approach prevents single points of failure and allows the swapping of components as needed.\n“Compute power is the new oil for the AI era,” said Ahmad Shadid, CEO and co-founder of io.net. “By leveraging GPU power as a decentralized resource, io.net will continue to play a crucial role in the future of technology and economy, with compute power backing the value of $IO.”\nLaunch of the Ignition Program\nHowever, io.net’s biggest advantage may be its crypto-economic model. By building on Solana, the network gains a trustless settlement layer without legacy inefficiencies. Plus, the $IO token — set to launch in April following io.net’s Ignition Program — has the ambition to become the currency of compute, attracting users and incentivizing infrastructure buildout in a continuous growth cycle.\nThe Ignition program aims to incentivize and reward IO Network suppliers and community members for their contributions to the network. Participants can earn rewards by supplying GPUs to the network, with factors such as job hours completed, node bandwidth, GPU model, and uptime taken into consideration by the rewards algorithm.\n“We are thrilled to launch the Ignition program as the first step in our mission to decentralize the IO Network and transition governance to the community,” said Garrison Yang, Chief Strategy & Marketing Officer at io.net. “By incentivizing and rewarding our suppliers and community members, we aim to expand access to underutilized GPU resources and make the power of AI accessible to anyone in the world.”\nCompute Power: The Lifeforce of AI\nWith its strong unit economics and token incentives, io.net is poised to grow exponentially, grabbing market share from the cloud giants. The timing could not be better, as the world is waking up to the transformative potential of AI. By making AI/ML compute more accessible, io.net is democratizing access to this critical resource.\nWhile centralized providers struggle with capacity, io.net offers an elegant solution through decentralization: It provides the tools and infrastructure for anyone to participate in the AI revolution. As more developers and suppliers plugin, network effects should drive rapid expansion and adoption.\nThe California Gold Rush completely reshaped the Western United States in the 1800s. Now, io.net is in pursuit of reshaping computing for the AI age. If successful, it could become an essential backbone for the next generation of AI innovation. The IO Cloud may very well enable the next OpenAIs and Anthropics but in a more open and permissionless way. Keep an eye on this project as the decentralized AI compute wars heat up.",
