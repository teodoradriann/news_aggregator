    "text": "PAJARO, Calif. (KION-TV) -- A historic part of Pajaro will be restored to become an even bigger part of the community.\nThe Porter Vallejo Mansion, once home to the Pajaro library, will be revitalized with a community space and an improved library.\nThe Mansion was damaged during the 2023 Pajaro flood with the library closed and a bookmobile taking its place.\n\"During the community meetings that happened after the flooding where discussions happened with the community on how use the AB 102 funding, this surfaced as one of the priorities for the community,\" County of Monterey Chief of Facilities Florence Kabwasa-Green said.\nThe Porter Vallejo Mansion will be transformed into a new library and a community space. Photo by Lindsey Selzer In the restoration, the county will focus on cleaning up flood debris, replacing the HVAC system and making needed repairs to the exteriors and interiors of the buildings.\nThe project will also see the addition of stairs and ADA lifts for access to the second and third floors and an outdoor area.\nThe Mansion is also the only building Pajaro the county owns.\n\"In Pajaro, there really is no county owned facility. This is it. This is the main county owned facility. And by refurbishing the second and third floors, we're gonna have a number of community space available,\" Kabwasa-Green said.\nThe estimated cost of restoration is set at $7.1 million and set to begin in May.",

It will be the first time they have played together and it will be something historic for Spanish tennis.\"\nNadal is a two-time Olympic champion, having won singles gold in Beijing in 2008, and doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Games alongside Marc Lopez.\n© 2024 AFP",

O fim de semana em Mato Grosso do Sul será marcado por tempo instável, com previsão de chuvas intensas e possibilidade de tempestades, segundo o Cemtec.

    "title": "Don Kusler: Democrats dominated 2023 with victories for reproductive rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box.\nVirginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office.\nThat's a victory for Democrats.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate.\nThat's another victory for the left.\nTwo ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state.\nPeople are also reading…\nThen on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin.\nThese electoral victories make a difference.\nJust look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize.\nLabor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts.\nWorkers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers.\nSometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans.\nIt was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business.\nLeadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people.\nThe one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job.\nDid the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker.\nThe sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats.\nSo a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories.\nYes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats.\nKusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action:\nadaction.org.

No entanto, o treinador lamentou o segundo tempo abaixo da equipe na Neo Química Arena.\n\"Grêmio fez jogo duro, é um time forte. Gostei do primeiro tempo, o segundo um pouco menos. Tivemos pouco tempo de recuperação e teremos pouco também para o jogo de domingo. A equipe vem fazendo um esforço enorme, de muita determinação, ímpeto. Vamos melhorar com o passar do tempo. Estamos contentes porque a torcida nos apoiou de forma incrível e graças a ajudar deles a equipe buscou esse empate. Precisamos melhorar algumas coisas, seguramente. Queríamos vencer, mas tem um adversário, são muitos jogos em sequência\", disse Ramón em entrevista coletiva.\nEmiliano Diaz, auxiliar que frequentemente concede coletiva com Ramón, explicou as alterações realizadas pela comissão técnica no segundo tempo. Alguns torcedores reclamaram da demora para as mexidas serem realizadas e não concordaram com a utilização do zagueiro Félix Torres na lateral direita, por exemplo, com Fagner disponível no banco de reservas.\nMauro Cezar\nPênalti 'à brasileira' em Itaquera ajuda Corinthians\nJuca Kfouri\nCorinthians e Grêmio estacionam com empate\nJamil Chade\nGuerras barram o sonho de despolitizar Olimpíadas\nDemétrio Vecchioli\nBrasil descobre ter uma das melhores do mundo no gol\n\"Sobre a primeira troca, sacamos um central para colocar mais um volante. Sacamos um lateral para ter um volante, para ter mais profundidade. Não queríamos trocar lateral por lateral. Quando você mexe e o time ganha, você é fenômeno. Quando não ganha, não, Mas faz parte, sabemos como é. Mas estamos orgulhosos, de nove pontos fizemos sete. Pés no chão, ninguém falou que seria fácil, e vamos seguir lutando. Sempre acreditamos no resultado. Não estamos felizes com nosso segundo tempo, é normal, mas estamos orgulhosos do grupo, que lutou até o final\", disse Emiliano.\n\"Fagner estava preparado, mas não queríamos colocar mais um lateral. A gente preferiu dar lugar para mais um meia. Fagner vem entrando com a gente, é capitão, líder, e vai ter chances como todos\", complementou.\nO Grêmio abriu o placar logo aos dois minutos de jogo, com o zagueiro Rodrigo Ely. Os mandantes empataram ainda na primeira etapa com Yuri Alberto, de pênalti. No segundo tempo, o Tricolor Gaúcho marcou com Villasanti, enquanto Garro deixou tudo igual nos últimos minutos.\nCom o empate, o Corinthians subiu para a 14ª posição do Brasileiro, com 19 pontos conquistados. Na próxima rodada, o time visita o Atlético-MG, no domingo, às 19 horas (de Brasília).\nComunicar erro Veja também Deixe seu comentário Só para assinantes",
