    "text": "主要观点：\n营收、利润增速均边际上行，领跑国有大行同业\n2024年 农业银行 营收、归母 净利润 分别同比增长+2.26%、+4.72%，在国有大行同业中均位列第一，分别较1-3Q24边际加速0.97pct、1.34pct。其中，利息净收入同比+1.56%，较1-3Q24增速边际提升0.6pct。中收净收入同比-5.65%，2024年代理业务收入下降20.6%，主要受到银保渠道“报行合一”影响，代理保险相关手续费收入减少。其他非息收入同比增长+26.3%，农业银行在市场 利率 中枢下行背景下综合考虑债券市场走势和组合管理需要，合理把握投资节奏，金融投资盈利水平较好。投资净收益、公允价值变动净收益、汇兑收益均高增，其中投资净收益占比其他非息收入达到57.35%，同比增长+12.22%。区域分布来看，2024年农业银行县域金融业务营收占比提升1.4pct至49.1%，中西部地区营收贡献由40.6%进一步提升至42%，充分把握城乡融合发展机遇。\n个贷增长亮眼，县域贷款占比保持40%以上\n2024年农业银行总 资产 、贷款、金融投资规模分别同比增长+8.4%、+10.13%、23.5%。贷款端来看，对公、个人、贴现分别同比增长+10.6%、+9.35%、+15%。公司贷款增长主要由中长期贷款拉动，2024年末中长期贷款占比提升至75.4%，制造业中长期贷款余额1.46万亿元，同比增长+20.2%。个人贷款增长亮眼，较同期全国住户贷款增速3.42%高出5.93pcts。个人消费贷、个人经营贷增长均保持强劲，2024年末农业银行个人消费贷（含信用卡）、个人经营贷分别同比增长28.3%、35%。县域支持力度不断加大，2024年末农业银行县域贷款余额9.85万亿元，占境内贷款比重保持40%以上，同比增长+12.3%，高于全行平均增速2.2pcts。2024年农业银行总 负债 、存款规模分别同比增长+8.56%、+4.87%，境内日均存款新增2.29万亿元，存款偏离度0.42%，日均增量可比同业最高、偏离度最低，客户资金留存效果较好。客户结构来看，个人存款占比提升2.6pcts至62.8%，公司存款受“手工补息”整改、挂牌利率率先调整等因素影响小幅下降。\n息差较三季度末小幅下降，主要为资产端收益率下行影响\n2024年末农业银行净息差1.42%，较三季度末下降3bps，全年降幅18bps。市场收益率快速下行时期，资产端降幅明显大于负债端。资产端来看，生息资产收益率降幅为29bps，其中，贷款、债券 投资收益率 分别降38bps、29bps至3.41%、2.99%。贷款分结构来看，公司、个人贷款全年收益率分别降30bps、53bps至3.34%、3.74%，化债置换、按揭贷款提前还款、消费贷行业竞争加剧等因素对贷款收益率下降均有影响。负债端来看，2024年计息负债成本率全年降幅11bps，其中存款付息率下降15bps至1.63%，公司、个人存款付息率分别下降18bps、13bps至1.75%、1.55%，存款挂牌利率调整对息差托举作用有所显现。农业银行负债端个人存款占比高，2025年一季度高息存款转存有望带动存款成本进一步下行。\n资产质量持续改善，风险抵补能力保持稳健\n2024年末农业银行不良率1.3%，较3Q24下降2bps，资产质量持续改善。拨备覆盖率299.61%，较三季度末小幅下降2.75pcts，风险抵补能力保持稳健。关注率、逾期率分别为1.4%、1.18%，较1H24分别下降2bps、上升17bps。逾期贷款结构来看，风险上升主要集中在3-12个月内贷款，占比自2023年末的11.5%提升至2024年末的14.2%，预计主要由于2024年年初开门红投放的个人信用贷款不良生成有所抬升所致。不良贷款结构来看，公司贷款不良率下降30bps至1.58%、个人贷款不良率上升30bps至1.03%，个人消费贷、经营贷不良抬升幅度较大。贷款减值损失变化来看，农业银行对新生不良的计提充分，2024年新增源生或购入的金融资产减值计提2165亿元，整体风险可控。2024年末，县域贷款不良率为1.21%，拨备覆盖率为338.33%，县域贷款资产质量整体好于全行平均，拨备也较其他类贷款更为充足，县域金融持续发力下资产质量有望逐步改善。\n投资建议\n城镇化进程放缓下，县域经济基数低、增速高，深耕县域的银行在客群、规模等方面有望受益于城乡融合加速发展。近三年来中部地区的安徽省和西部地区的四川省与全国平均贷款增速差逐渐扩大，产业发展迅速、地区吸引力增加，带动金融需求高景气。农业银行深耕三农金融、中西部地区，网点数量在国有四大行中居前。2024年营收、利润增长双提速，跃居国有大行之首。县域金融战略带动规模增长领先国有大行同业，负债端具备低 成本优势 。2024年末不良率、关注率实现双降，县域贷款不良率好于全行贷款不良率，资产质量整体保持稳健。我们预计公司2025-2027年 营业收入 分别同比增长-\n0.96%/1.81%/4.53%，归母净利润分别同比增长\n1.26%/1.36%/2.37%，维持“买入”评级。\n风险提示\n利率风险：市场利率持续下行，优质资产竞争加剧，息差收窄。",

    "text": "VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis, who often pleads for compassion to prisoners, washed the feet of 12 incarcerated women in Rome on Thursday in a rite marking Holy Thursday before Easter.\nThe Argentinian Jesuit visited the Rebibbia women’s prison in the north-eastern outskirts of the Italian capital, where he performed the same rite in 2015.\nThursday, however, was the first time the 87-year-old Pontiff had dedicated his annual ritual during Holy Week solely to women.\nSeated in a wheelchair, the Pope washed the feet of each of the prisoners, some of them in tears, before drying them off with a towel and kissing them.\n“We all have small failures, big failures,” said the Pope in an impromptu homily during a mass held in the courtyard of the prison that holds some 370 women.\n“But the Lord is always waiting for us, with open arms, and he never tires of forgiving,” he added.\nThe washing of feet is “a gesture that draws our attention to the vocation of service”, said Francis, who as a priest in Buenos Aires had already begun visiting prisoners.",
