    "title": "'Really scary': Families brace for impact of transgender youth care ban in Ohio – 95.5 WSB",
    "text": "NEW YORK — Astrid Burkle, a 10-year-old transgender girl who lives in Ohio, said she wishes she \"could have a normal life.\" Her desire for normalcy -- a life of baking cookies with her grandmother, singing with her friends in the local choir, and going on field trips -- is shrouded by impending anti-transgender legislation passed by the statehouse. \"It's been really frustrating at times,\" Astrid told ABC News in an interview alongside her family. \"Because there's just so many people out there who are just really mean.\" Families across the state are bracing for the impact of a bill that would restrict certain transgender rights for minors. Ohio House Bill 68 is comprised of two acts: the \"Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act,\" which would ban transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming care, and the \"Save Women's Sports Act,\" which would prevent transgender girls from taking part in girls' and women's sports. An exception in this bill allows hormone-based care and surgery for intersex and cisgender youth. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has yet to announce whether he will sign or veto the legislation – but more than three-fifths of legislators have voted in favor of the bill so far and can override his veto. Astrid's mother, Alicia Burkle said Astrid has been receiving strictly mental health care services in recent years. Therapy, Astrid said, offers a \"safe space\" to talk through her experiences. However, the restrictions placed on Astrid's future choices for care have the family questioning their options. \"Just because you've said that you're not going to allow us to get the care here in Ohio doesn't mean we're suddenly going to stop getting the care for our kids,\" said Alicia Burkle. She continued, \"We trust the science, we trust her healthcare providers. And so we're going to do what we have to do and whether that is travel out of state to get it, whether it's leave the state and move -- that's what we'll do.\" Burkle said her cisgender daughter is on hormone replacement therapy -- \"But nobody's questioning that ... So I don't understand.\" Supporters of gender-affirming care restrictions believe that gender transitioning is harmful to youth. Some say patients should wait until they are older to make this kind of health decision. State Sen. Terry Johnson, who is a retired physician, argued in favor of the bill on the Senate floor. \"If you don't know if something you're doing is going to hurt someone 10, 15, 20 years down the road -- or maybe even one year down the road -- don't do it,\" Johnson said in a Dec. 13 debate. \"The medical evidence is not there to support what we're doing in the country.\" Critics of these laws say they prevent families and physicians from making decisions about their health care and will harm transgender youth. MORE: Federal judge blocks Idaho gender-affirming transgender care ban State Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson argued against the bill in the Dec. 13 debate. \"When we look at this legislation, let's be clear, it is not necessarily about preventing children from being exposed to these types of procedures, but it is preventing parents who are making decisions about the health care of their children,\" she said. \"It also removes that decision for health care from professionals and parents and gives it again to government.\" Gender-affirming care has been called safe, effective, and medically necessary by more than 20 major national medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association. Dr. Christopher Bolling, a member of the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told ABC News in an interview that pediatricians and physicians are \"extremely cautious\" when it comes to gender-affirming care and often have many long conversations with people who are questioning their gender. This gives patients time to explore their identity and create an individualized approach to care. For youth approaching puberty, puberty blockers are a reversible form of gender-affirming care that allows children to pause puberty and explore their gender identity without the growth of permanent sex characteristics, according to physicians interviewed by ABC News. This option would be banned by the legislation. It would also ban hormone therapy, which brings physical traits in line with gender identify. Often because of gender-related discrimination and gender dysphoria, transgender youth are more likely to experience anxiety, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation and attempts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research shows that hormone therapy can improve the mental health of transgender adolescents and teenagers, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found. The legislation has a grandfather clause that allows minors who are already on medication to continue to receive care. It's a benefit for some families in the state, including Nick Zingarelli, his wife and his teenage daughter who is already taking puberty blockers. Zingarelli raised his daughter in Cincinnati, Ohio -- but the family moved to Missouri in 2019 to be closer to his wife's family. His daughter came out as transgender in 2020 when she was still a preteen. He told ABC News that his daughter's coming out changed both everything and nothing about their family. \"Obviously it changed everything in terms of having to advocate for her rights,\" said Zingarelli in an interview. \"Missouri is a deep red state.\" He continued, \"And when I say that nothing at all changed -- when we told friends, family, school, everybody, it was like, 'Okay, great. So these are her new pronouns. This is her name.'\" Zingarelli said he met with doctors at the time who said there was nothing they could do for his daughter at her age except for counseling. \"So this belief that doctors are just running to get prescriptions filled and everything else as soon as gender dysphoria is disclosed is nonsense,\" said Zingarelli. Zingarelli and his family later moved back to Ohio in part to escape anti-transgender legislation in Missouri that restricted trans participation in sports and gender-affirming care. They did not expect to be faced with restrictive legislation in Ohio, the place they call home, he said. For Zingarelli, the grandfather clause protecting his daughter's care is \"not good enough,\" since it doesn't protect care in the future for children like Astrid who are not yet old enough to receive medical care. The community has been supportive of Astrid and her family, according to Astrid's father, Aaron. \"We want to be able to support our communities and the state of Ohio, but like, people are going to leave,\" said Abs Burkle, Astrid's sister. \"People are going to be hurt. They're not going to want to come back to Ohio.\" If you or a loved one is struggling with a mental health crisis or considering suicide, call or text 988. Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio.

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\n- Es de Eibar y sale de su cantera. ¿Es seguidor armero?\n- Soy socio del Eibar desde pequeño porque es el equipo de mi ... pueblo. Siempre que puedo intento ir. La semana que viene por ejemplo me voy a acercar a Cádiz porque juegan allí. Les sigo mucho. Ahora con Beñat han dado un paso adelante, ha entrado con buen pie y están jugando bien al fútbol. Y se están dando los resultados con mucha gente guipuzcoana. Es importante eso.\n- Entra en Zubieta en categoría cadete y cuando uno destaca en casa suena el teléfono...\n- Alguno llamó, pero estaba seguro de que quería ir a la Real y salió bien. Puede ser que fuese al otro lado de la A-8 (risas).\n- ¿Cómo está viendo a la Real?\n- Cansada, la verdad. El parón les va a venir bien porque jugar tantos partidos cada tres días es una barbaridad. Y cuesta más a nivel mental que físico. Lo digo de verdad. Viajar, subirte a un avión, no estar en casa... Algunos no han pasado por casa desde Mánchester y ahora tienen partidos exigentes con la selección. En estos dos últimos meses estoy convencido de que lo van a hacer genial.\n- Por lesiones ha faltado gente de arriba. ¿Viendo estos partidos, piensa que ha tenido mala suerte?\n- No lo enfoco así, no lo veo con pena. Me alegro por la gente de Zubieta que entra. Son amigos. Mira Arka (Mariezkurrena), lo está haciendo genial en el Sanse y le ha llegado su oportunidad. Como él, otros tantos que no han tenido la oportunidad. Cada uno tiene su momento, y si ahora es el suyo, o el de Luken, son gente de la casa que se lo merecen. Zubieta siempre responde. Me pone feliz ver cómo les va, mira el recibimiento a Mariezkurrena en Astigarraga. Eso es la Real. Los canteranos lo sentimos porque es nuestro club. Juegas la Champions, pero la juegas con la Real y eso es lo más. Tus amigos y familiares están en la grada y eso siempre será un plus. Zubieta es una de las mejores canteras del mundo.\n- ¿Con qué día se queda?\n- Diría que con el debut, ese día lo tengo marcado para siempre. Jugar la Champions contra el Inter en San Siro también es la leche, me acuerdo de todo lo que sucedió ese día desde que me levanté.\n- ¿Uno sueña con eso?\n- Me acuerdo que cuando era txiki mi meta era jugar en Primera, pero no piensas en jugar la Champions. He tenido esa suerte y es un sueño cumplido. Lo haces además con tus amigos; Olasagasti, Turrientes, Marrero, Urko... Son con los que más relación tengo por lo que hemos vivido juntos.\n- ¿Qué entrenador le ha marcado en la Real?\n- Sergio Francisco. Es el entrenador con el que más tiempo he pasado. Es un tío cercano, que ayuda al jugador y me quedaría con él. Ha renovado por tres años y me alegro mucho por él porque es otro de la casa. Si quiere, tendrá ofertas para dar y regalar porque es muy buen entrenador.\n- Tiene contrato hasta 2026, ¿la mirada se va más allá?\n- Está caro jugar, no voy a mentir. Pero tengo que pensar en el ahora y ya veremos qué pasa en verano. No pienso en eso. Algún amigo mío siempre me dice que «hay que verlas venir». Pues eso, lo que tenga que pasar, ya vendrá.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?

    "text": "Read full article The Independent Travel warnings issued as cold snap and icy weather grips the UK Athena Stavrou and Andy Gregory January 3, 2025 at 12:57 a.m. · 4 min read Link Copied Wintry weather has caused disruption to road and rail travel(Paul Campbell/PA) (PA Wire)\nBritons wanting to travel home after the New Year have been warned to expect disruption, as snow and icy weather grips the UK and temperatures plunge as low as -8C.\nThe country will be welcoming 2025 with a cold snap expected to last a week, with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issuing cold weather health alerts for all of England until 8 January, meaning a rise in deaths is likely.\nThe Met Office has also issued weather warnings for the next five days, the first of which – for snow and ice, in parts of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland – came into force at 4pm on Thursday, cautioning that travel disruption was likely.\nDan Stroud, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “There’ll be widespread frost across the country tonight, from Land’s End to John O’Groats. It will be comfortably below where we should be for this time of year and I would expect temperatures to hit -8C in parts of Scotland.”\nADVERTISEMENT Mr Stroud confirmed conditions should become warmer by the end of this weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.\nHe said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles. But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday. They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”\nAge UK director Caroline Abrahams said the government’s decision to limit the winter fuel allowance to only the poorest pensioners will be put “into sharp relief” by the cold snap. The charity has already been contacted by older people “worrying about what to do when this moment arrived”, she said.\nMs Abrahams said: “We urge older people to do everything they can to stay warm, even if that means risking spending more on their heating than they feel they can afford. The energy companies are under an obligation to help if you are struggling and there may be support available from your local council too.”\nFor those who intend to travel despite the current wintry weather, both the Met Office and National Rail issued alerts to remind Britons to plan ahead.\nADVERTISEMENT Difficult driving conditions should be expected, particularly within areas under a yellow weather warning. Allowing extra time is also advised, with delays, diversions, or hampered conditions likely for road users.\nSnow touched the ground in the west end of Aberdeen on Thursday (Beth Edmonston/PA Wire)\nFor those using public transport, passengers were advised to check any timetables and services before setting out in case of delays or cancellations due to inclement weather.\nAs per National Rail, the poor weather will impact trains running across Great Britain, with Northern services, TransPennine Express services, Transport for Wales services and ScotRail services all impacted.\nOn Thursday, services were halted on two key Scottish railway lines – the Highlands Main Line, and the Far North Line between Inverness and Wick – after heavy rain caused landslips and flooding, while the A939 between Cockbridge and Tomintoul in Aberdeenshire was closed due to snow.\nADVERTISEMENT It comes after many in Greater Manchester woke up on New Year’s Day to devastating flooding, with the police declaring a major incident as people were forced to evacuate.\nAround 450 people were evacuated on Wednesday evening from a Didsbury hotel while 400 homes were at a lower risk with no widespread evacuation needed, police said.\nAround 450 people were evacuated on Wednesday evening from a Didsbury hotel (REUTERS)\nAs of Thursday night, the Environment Agency had issued seven flood warnings in areas where flooding is expected, mainly in Yorkshire and Shropshire, along with 37 lesser flood alerts in areas where flooding is possible.\nA yellow warning for snow will be in place until Monday morning (Met Office)\nOver Saturday and Sunday, England and Wales are set to see the brunt of the wintry weather, with the Met Office warning of the potential for power cuts, communities to become cut off, and for some vehicles to be left stranded, with disruption to rail and air travel also possible.\nADVERTISEMENT About 5cm of snow is expected widely across the Midlands, Wales and northern England, with as much as 20-30cm over high ground in Wales and/or the Pennines, the forecaster added.\nA final warning, in force until midday on Monday, warns of snow across most of Scotland, with similar hazards to those seen over the weekend further south.",

    "title": "Cooking With Aluminum Foil Increases Aluminum Exposure",
    "text": "Studies show aluminum leaches into food during cooking, and can result in an 8.1 percent increase in urinary aluminum concentrations during high-exposure periods\nAluminum is everywhere in our modern world, from cookware to food packaging.\nBut did you know that your everyday use of aluminum foil could be significantly increasing your exposure to this harmful metal?\nResearch published in Environment International revealed aluminum foil and containers used in food preparation contribute to your body’s aluminum burden, with serious risks to your health.\nWhile aluminum is naturally present in the environment, its widespread use in consumer products has led to increased human exposure. Your body doesn’t need aluminum for any biological processes, and accumulation over time is dangerous.\nAluminum has been linked to various health issues, including neurological problems and bone disorders. What’s more, your body may struggle to eliminate excess aluminum, especially if you have impaired kidney function.\nMinimizing your exposure to this pervasive metal in your daily life, the new study shows may start right in your kitchen.\nUsing aluminum foil boosts your body’s metal burden The research, a first-of-its-kind human intervention study, explored whether consuming food prepared with aluminum foil and containers leads to increased aluminum levels in the body.\nThe study involved 11 healthy participants who followed a controlled diet for 30 days.\nDuring the middle 10 days, their meals were prepared using aluminum foil and stored in aluminum containers. Urine samples were collected twice daily throughout the study to measure aluminum excretion.\nThis rigorous design allowed researchers to detect even small changes in aluminum levels and determine if any increases were reversible.\nThe findings were clear: consuming food prepared with aluminum foil and containers led to a measurable increase in aluminum levels in the body . On average, participants experienced an 8.1% increase in their urinary aluminum concentrations during the exposure phase.\nThis increase was reversible in healthy adults with normal kidney function — once the exposure to aluminum cookware ceased, aluminum levels returned to baseline within days. However, this reversibility might not apply to everyone, especially those with compromised kidney function.\nThe estimated additional aluminum intake from this high-exposure scenario represented about 4.4 percent of the tolerable weekly intake set by European food safety authorities.\nEven small increases in aluminum exposure could contribute to a higher body burden over time, and current safety guidelines may not account for the most vulnerable populations or the effects of lifelong exposure.\nThe hidden dangers of cooking with aluminum foil A study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health also found aluminum leaches into your food when you cook with aluminum foil.\nResearchers examined the aluminum content in meat and fish wrapped in aluminum foil and cooked in an oven.\nThe use of aluminum foil significantly increased aluminum levels in the food. For instance, chicken and fish cooked with aluminum foil and seasoning showed aluminum concentrations as high as 40 to 42 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg).\nWhen cooked without seasoning, the aluminum levels were still notably elevated compared to food cooked without foil.\nThese findings are particularly concerning because the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg of aluminum per kg of body weight.\nThe study suggests that regular consumption of foods cooked in aluminum foil could lead to exceeding this recommended limit, especially when combined with other sources of aluminum.\nFactors affecting aluminum leaching Several factors influence the amount of aluminum that leaches into your food when cooking with foil. The study revealed that pH levels, salinity, fat content, temperature and exposure time all play roles in this process.\nAcidic foods, those high in salt and fatty foods tend to increase aluminum migration from the foil into your food.\nIn some cases, such as with beef, cooking without seasoning led to higher aluminum levels. This unexpected result was attributed to the high-fat content in beef, which may interact with organic acids present in the meat, resulting in increased aluminum uptake from the foil.\nThe study also noted that the thickness of the aluminum foil used affects the amount of metal released. While the research used one of the thinnest foils available on the market, preliminary tests suggested that thicker foils might lead to even greater aluminum release into food.\nTo further illustrate the aluminum leaching process, researchers examined used aluminum foil under a scanning electron microscope. The results were striking.\nFoil that had been in direct contact with food showed significant deterioration, with numerous holes ranging from 100 to 150 micrometers in diameter.\nThe foil used to cook food with seasoning showed even more extensive damage, with larger and more numerous holes.\nThis visible degradation of the foil’s surface provides clear evidence of aluminum migration into the food.\nEven portions of the foil not in direct contact with the food showed some deterioration, albeit to a lesser extent. These microscopic observations offer a tangible representation of how cooking with aluminum foil leads to the transfer of aluminum into your food.\nFood cooked in foil may have 40 times more aluminum In another study exploring how cooking different foods in aluminum foil affects aluminum levels, significant increases in aluminum content across various food types were found, especially those that were marinated.\nFor example, marinated mackerel wrapped in foil and baked showed aluminum levels up to 49.34 mg/kg — over 40 times higher than the control samples.\nEven without marinade, foods like salmon and duck breast still saw noticeable increases in aluminum. The study authors concluded that “excessive consumption of food prepared by baking in aluminum foil can carry a health risk.”\nAgain, the study found the amount of aluminum that migrates into your food depends on several factors.\nTemperature plays a key role — higher cooking temperatures lead to more leaching. In this study, foods were baked at 220 degrees Celsius (428 degrees Fahrenheit) for 40 minutes, resulting in significant aluminum increases.\nThe acidity and salt content of food also impact aluminum transfer. Marinated foods consistently showed higher aluminum levels compared to their non-marinated counterparts.\nFor instance, marinated duck breast without skin reached levels of 45.18 mg/kg when cooked in foil, while the non-marinated version only increased to 0.61 mg/kg. Interestingly, the presence of skin seemed to provide some protective effect.\nDuck breast with skin showed lower aluminum levels than skinless samples, suggesting the skin may act as a barrier . The specific type of aluminum foil used can also influence leaching.\nThe study tested five different commercial foils and found variations in their aluminum transfer rates, revealing that not all foils are created equal when it comes to food safety.\nAluminum accumulates in your brain, contributes to Alzheimer’s disease Aluminum has been linked to several serious health conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease and autism . It’s considered a neurotoxin and accumulates in various tissues, including bones, your parathyroid gland and your brain.\nFor instance, studies have found higher concentrations of aluminum in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to people without Alzheimer’s, particularly in areas like the hippocampus and temporal lobes.\nDrinking water with high aluminum levels (over 0.1 mg per liter) was also associated with two to three times higher Alzheimer’s prevalence in long-term studies while reducing aluminum burden through silicon-rich mineral water consumption improved cognitive function in some Alzheimer’s patients.\nSilicon appears to be a natural antagonist to aluminum, helping reduce its absorption and accumulation.\nMeanwhile, autism rates have risen dramatically since the late 1990s, with some researchers attributing 75 to 80 percent of this increase to environmental factors rather than just improved diagnosis.\nMultiple studies have found higher aluminum concentrations in hair and urine samples of autistic children, and autism may involve an impaired ability to metabolize and excrete aluminum.\nMultiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients also show higher aluminum levels in brain tissue compared to controls.\nOne study found MS patients had urinary aluminum excretion comparable to those undergoing metal chelation therapy, suggesting their bodies are actively trying to eliminate excess aluminum.\nSilicon-rich mineral water consumption increased aluminum excretion in MS patients, potentially reducing its accumulation.\nFor Parkinson’s disease, occupational exposure to aluminum appears to double the risk. Miners with respiratory aluminum exposure, for instance, had a 30 percent higher Parkinson’s disease incidence.\nAluminum accumulates in the substantia nigra and Lewy bodies, disrupting dopamine production. It may also affect genes related to Parkinson’s disease.\nCombining aluminum exposure with other metals or pesticides seems to have synergistic negative effects. Early Parkinson’s disease diagnosis may be possible by analyzing serum aluminum levels along with other element imbalances.\nAluminum’s toxic effects throughout your body When you’re exposed to aluminum through food, water or other sources, it accumulates in various organs and tissues, leading to a range of health issues .\nAs mentioned, in your brain, aluminum interferes with gene expression and enzyme function, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. It disrupts mitochondrial function, depleting adenosine triphosphate levels and causing cell death.\nIn your bones, aluminum replaces calcium, leading to weakened bones and increased fracture risk. It inhibits the enzyme that activates vitamin D, further compromising bone health.\nAluminum accumulation in your bone marrow causes anemia by interfering with hemoglobin synthesis. In your liver, aluminum disrupts iron metabolism and mitochondrial function, contributing to fatty liver disease and metabolic disorders.\nThe symptoms of aluminum toxicity can be subtle at first but become more severe as exposure continues. You may experience memory loss, confusion and difficulty with coordination and speech. In advanced cases, this progresses to seizures and even coma.\nAluminum also impacts your musculoskeletal system, causing bone pain, fractures and muscle weakness. Your kidneys may struggle to filter aluminum, leading to kidney dysfunction and an increased risk of kidney stones.\nRespiratory issues like asthma, chronic bronchitis and pulmonary fibrosis can develop, especially in occupational settings with high aluminum exposure.\nYou might also experience changes in your blood cells, leading to anemia and increased susceptibility to infections. Liver function is also compromised by excess aluminum, resulting in abnormal enzyme levels and liver disease.\nThese diverse symptoms underscore the importance of recognizing and addressing aluminum toxicity early — and taking steps to reduce your exposure .\nHow to reduce your aluminum exposure To protect yourself from aluminum’s harmful effects, start by examining your diet and lifestyle. Avoid cooking with aluminum foil or cookware and storing foods in aluminum containers, as this poses the risk of leaching. Opt for stainless steel, glass or ceramic cookware instead.\nWhile I don’t recommend cooking your food in foil, if you do be sure to avoid cooking acidic or salty foods in it, as these increase aluminum leaching .\nReducing cooking temperatures and times when using foil may also help limit transfer. If you’re preparing food for young children, it’s especially important to avoid using aluminum foil. Children under three years of age, in particular, are considered a high-risk group.\nAvoiding processed foods and beverages is also important, as many contain aluminum additives. Check your personal care products, especially antiperspirants, as well and choose aluminum-free alternatives.\nHave your water tested for aluminum and consider using a reverse osmosis filter if levels are high.\nTo further reduce your exposure, avoid aluminum-based antacids and be aware that aluminum is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant , making vaccines another route of exposure.\nBy educating yourself and making informed choices about your cookware and food preparation methods, you can take steps to protect your health and reduce unnecessary aluminum exposure.\nRemember, even small changes in your cooking habits may have a substantial impact on your long-term health and well-being.\nSee more here childrenshealthdefense\nHeader image: Amazon\nBold and italic emphasis added\nPlease Donate Below To Support Our Ongoing Work To Defend The Scientific Method PRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.

    "title": "Couple plead guilty after 'cowardly' attack on gay language interpreter in Sydney - ABC News",
    "text": "In short: A 38-year-old gay man said he felt like an \"easy target\" 10 months after an attack in a Sydney car park. A couple pleaded guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm after Borna Kazerani was kicked in the stomach and testicles, and punched in the face. Mr Kazerani said he thought homophobia was related to the assault, which left him feeling not \"100 per cent secure\". Borna Kazerani escaped a country that punishes homosexuality with death. But now, the Iranian-born filmmaker's sense of safety in his adopted home of Australia has been shaken.\nDuring a visit to a popular Sydney market one Sunday last August, the openly gay man was met with homophobic slurs and fists.\n\"I wear eye makeup, so I was probably an easy target for these people,\" Mr Kazerani, 38, said.\nHis attackers were a couple in their 20s from Sydney's north-west. One was the mother of a four-month-old boy.\n\"They started punching my face, they shoved my chest, and then I fell,\" he said.\nThe violence erupted about 12:30pm in the Parklea Markets car park, according to court documents.\nMr Kazerani and a friend were heading back to his vehicle when a black SUV overtook them.\nIn the passenger seat was 23-year-old tradesman Cortez Solomon. His 21-year-old girlfriend, Paris Te Atahu Makene Stone, was driving.\nA friend of Borna Kazerani was able to capture photos of the Parklea assault. ( Supplied )\nAfter passing the pedestrians, Mr Solomon turned and gave Mr Kazerani the finger. Mr Kazerani shrugged and kept walking.\nThe car stopped and Mr Solomon got out. Despite his girlfriend's protests, he confronted Mr Kazerani about walking in the middle of the road.\n\"Sorry, I didn't know this is a two-way roads [sic],\" Mr Kazerani said.\n\"So what motherf***er?\" Mr Solomon replied.\nThen came the anti-gay insults. Mr Solomon called Mr Kazerani a \"homo\" and \"pooftah\" before shoving him in the chest.\nMr Solomon started punching Mr Kazerani in the head and face while kicking him in the testicles.\nMr Kazerani tried to push him away, and his friend began taking photos of his attacker and the car.\nMs Makene Stone exited the vehicle and tried to separate the men by pulling on Mr Kazerani's hair.\nMr Kazerani pushed the woman away, prompting Mr Solomon to launch another flurry of punches.\nMr Kazerani fell to the ground and the couple kicked him in the ribs before driving off.\nHe was left with a swollen jaw, dizziness and bruising around his eyes and nose.\nMr Kazerani called triple-0, but he said the police never came.\nBorna Kazeran with a black eye after the assault.\n\"That was the biggest problem because I contacted the police and they said they were short on staff,\" he said.\nHe ended up taking himself to Castle Hill Police Station to report the assault.\nTwo weeks later, officers arrested Mr Solomon at the couple's home in Riverstone.\nMr Solomon claimed Mr Kazerani was the aggressor and told police he only assaulted him to protect his girlfriend.\nDuring a police interview, Ms Makene Stone admitted she kicked the victim in the stomach.\nMr Solomon and Ms Makene Stone were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Both pleaded guilty.\nIn November, Mr Solomon was sentenced to an 18-month community correction order and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service.\nOn Thursday Ms Makene Stone was handed a community correction order of 15 months.\nHer barrister, Varinder Pawar, told Blacktown Local Court that at the time of the assault, the young mother was undergoing treatment for depression after giving birth to her son.\nBut Magistrate Brian van Zuylen said Ms Makene Stone's postpartum depression did not justify her kicking someone on the ground, describing her role in the fight as \"pretty cowardly\".\n\"I'm not sure it's the right way to stop [the fight] by pulling out his hair,\" Magistrate van Zuylen said.\nOutside court, Ms Makene Stone apologised for the attack and denied it had anything to do with homophobia.\n\"I'm very open with all that kind of stuff,\" she said.\nMr Pawar said his client was \"extremely sorry\" for the assault.\n\"Something like that will never happen again and she extends her apologies to the victim involved,\" he said.\nMr Kazerani, who also works as a language interpreter for courts, watched Thursday's sentencing hearing.\nHe told the ABC he did not believe the assault was unrelated to homophobia.\nHe added he now felt less secure in Australia, which he regarded as \"kind of\" open-minded.\nBut Mr Kazerani said he was satisfied with his attackers' punishments.\n\"It shows that if everyone stands up for their rights, especially LGBTQ community members, they can get what they're looking for as justice,\" he said.\nPosted 3m ago 3 minutes ago Thu 13 Jun 2024 at 9:00pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)",
