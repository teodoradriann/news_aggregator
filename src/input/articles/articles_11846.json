    "title": "放宽店铺外摆凸显城市治理温度|浙江省_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "编辑部：\n记者最近在地方采访时发现，一些城市临街商铺开展外摆经营的情况明显增多。日前，以杭州为代表的浙江多个城市放宽店铺外摆政策，因地制宜支持商贸经营主体利用自有场地外摆促销，支持临街商铺开展外摆经营，并协调解决外摆集中区停车难问题。这些举措凸显城市治理的温度与精度，让“烟火气”升腾、市集更热闹，进一步激活了消费市场。\n记者注意到，浙江放宽外摆，并非“地摊经济”的低层次回归，而是对新经济形态融入城市肌理的一种探索实践。以杭州传统街区吴山广场为例，“外摆新政”实施后，吴山广场附近街区实现迭代升级，许多充满数字科技、市井烟火气、沉浸式文旅及原创品牌的新潮店铺落地。走在石板路上，人们吃着带有麦香与炭火气息的路边摊，欣赏AR技术投影出的宋韵水墨画。“烟火气”与“潮生活”交织，市民和外地游客纷纷前来“打卡”。对于商业外摆，浙江提供精准政策支持，激发商家们“摆”出新意、“摆”对内容，形成独特的消费场景，为放大线下消费开辟了新路径。\n当然，放宽店铺外摆，不应是刺激消费的“急就章”，不能简单停留在放开或放宽的层次上，还要有长远谋划。比如，可针对城市文化禀赋和特色景观，充分利用外摆区空间搭建星空棚、露营区等，打造以地方美食、民生夜市等为主题的品牌集市，充分营造体验式消费氛围，不断推动各类商圈提颜值、聚人气、添活力。\n放宽店铺外摆，具有重要的经济价值。城市公共空间不仅具有物理属性，更是经济活动的重要载体。对于商铺经营者来说，放宽外摆后，可联动室内室外经营空间，通过延长消费者停留时间、增强场景体验感等，创造出“空间溢价”。从资源配置角度看，通过“潮汐型”“便民型”摊位设置，可实现公共空间的时间维度再分配，盘活闲置空间资源，实现效益最大化。\n放宽店铺外摆，考验治理智慧。此前，一些地方的监管过于严苛，对摆摊设点“光踩刹车”“只设路障”；一些地方又过于宽松、听之任之，最终影响城市形象。如何跳出“一管就死，一放就乱”的怪圈？治理理念的转变是关键。只有打破传统“以罚代管”模式，将治理重心从“禁止外摆”转向“规范引导”，将外摆审批权限下放，使审批效率和商户合规经营率同步提升，实现从“堵”到“疏”的转变。当前，不少城市管理部门积极推进“首违不罚”，实施包容审慎监管，构建法治营商暖环境。在柔性执法中包容审慎，在包容审慎中柔性执法，才能更好实现城市市容和市场繁荣相兼容。\n记者柳文于杭州\n2025年4月15日",

    "text": "[American Lung A...](http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/user/american-lung-association)on Thu, 12/19/2024 - 16:26\nThe American Lung Association is increasing efforts to raise awareness for the two largest risk factors for lung cancer – smoking cigarettes and exposure to radon gas. To help reduce the risk of lung cancer for people throughout the U.S., the organization is educating the public about how they can test for radon and offering proven resources to help people quit smoking for good.\nCHICAGO | December 17, 2024\nThe [American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/) is increasing efforts to raise awareness for the two largest risk factors for lung cancer – smoking cigarettes and exposure to radon gas. To help reduce the risk of lung cancer for people throughout the U.S., the organization is educating the public about how they can test for radon and offering proven resources to help people quit smoking for good.\n“Smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer and radon exposure is the second leading cause. People who smoke who are also exposed to radon are at an even greater risk of lung cancer, so it is even more important for them to test for radon and start their journey to quit for good,” said Harold Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association. “The New Year is one of the most common times of the year for people to quit smoking and January is National Radon Action Month, so now is the perfect time for people to take action to protect their health.”\nRadon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is odorless, tasteless and colorless. It seeps into homes and buildings through cracks in floors, walls and foundations, often going unnoticed even if it is present at dangerous levels. At least 1 in 15 homes in the U.S. have elevated radon levels, putting millions of people at risk. Radon-related lung cancer is responsible for an estimated 21,000 deaths annually in the U.S.\nCigarette smoking is directly responsible for approximately 80-90% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. Despite increased awareness of the dangers of smoking, millions continue to smoke, putting themselves at significant risk for developing lung cancer.\nTaking Action to Reduce Risk for Lung Cancer:\n-\nRadon Testing : The American Lung Association encourages all homeowners to test for radon, as it is the only way to know if radon levels are elevated. Radon test kits are widely available, affordable and easy to use. If elevated radon levels are detected, mitigation systems can be installed to reduce exposure. Learn more at\n[Lung.org/radon](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/radon). -\nSmoking Cessation: Quitting smoking is the single most important step individuals can take to protect their lung health. While 70% of people who smoke want to quit, many face challenges in doing so without proper support. Comprehensive treatment plans, including behavioral counseling and FDA-approved cessation medications, have proven effective in helping people quit for good. People can start their quit smoking journal at\n[Lung.org/quit-smoking](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking)or by calling the Lung Helpline at 1-800-586-4872.\nTo enhance its efforts to reduce lung cancer risk, the American Lung Association is partnering with the [Indoor Environments Association (IEA)](https://aarst.org/) . This collaboration aims to promote awareness about the dangers of radon exposure and smoking, and provide resources for smoking cessation. Through the partnership, the Lung Association is connecting radon and vapor intrusion professionals, their families, and IEA members with proven quit smoking resources, including the [Freedom From Smoking Plus program](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/join-freedom-from-smoking) .\nFor more information on radon testing and smoking cessation resources, visit [Lung.org/quit-smoking](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking) and [Lung.org/radon](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/radon) .\nAbout the American Lung Association\nThe American Lung Association is the leading organization working to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease through education, advocacy and research. The work of the American Lung Association is focused on four strategic imperatives: to defeat lung cancer; to champion clean air for all; to improve the quality of life for those with lung disease and their families; and to create a tobacco-free future.

    "text": "O Ministério do Desenvolvimento, Indústria, Comércio e Serviços (MDIC) divulgou nesta sexta-feira (5) que a balança comercial encerrou 2023 com superávit recorde de US$ 98,839 bilhões, impulsionada pela safra recorde de soja e pela queda das importações. O resultado representa alta de 60,6% sobre 2022, pelo critério da média diária, e é o maior desde o início da série histórica em 1989. No ano passado, as exportações bateram recorde, enquanto as importações recuaram. Em 2023, o Brasil vendeu US$ 339,673 bilhões para o exterior, alta de 1,7% em relação a 2022. As compras do exterior somaram US$ 240,835 bilhões, recuo de 11,7% na mesma comparação.\nEm dezembro, a balança comercial registrou superávit de US$ 9,36 bilhões. O valor também é recorde para o mês, com alta de 127,1% sobre o mesmo mês de 2022 pelo critério da média diária, que minimiza a diferença de dias úteis entre meses iguais de um ano e outro.\nAs exportações totalizaram US$ 28,839 bilhões no mês passado, com aumento de 2,1% em relação a dezembro de 2022 pela média diária. As importações somaram US$ 19,479 bilhões, com queda de 11,3%, também pela média diária.\nSegundo o ministério, o recorde nas exportações decorreu principalmente do aumento da quantidade exportada, que subiu 8,7% no ano passado, impulsionado principalmente pela safra recorde de grãos. Os preços médios recuaram 6,3%, puxados principalmente pela desaceleração na cotação das commodities (bens primários com cotação internacional).\nNas importações, a quantidade comprada caiu 2,6%, mas o preço médio recuou 8,8%. A queda nos preços decorreu principalmente da redução no preço internacional do petróleo e de derivados, como fertilizantes, em 2023. Em 2022, as cotações dispararam por causa do início da guerra entre Rússia e Ucrânia.\n“Mesmo com queda do preço de commodities e menor crescimento na economia mundial, o Brasil avançou 8,7% no volume das exportações e 1,7% do valor das exportações. Nossas exportações cresceram dez vezes mais que a média mundial. Em todo o planeta, as exportações cresceram 0,8% no ano passado”, declarou, por meio de videoconferência, o ministro do Desenvolvimento, Indústria, Comércio e Serviços e Vice-Presidente da República, Geraldo Alckmin.\nVeja Também: MP que reonera folha de pagamentos reflete desespero fiscal do governo Governo aumenta exigência de conteúdo local em petróleo e gás, cumprindo promessa de Lula Governo Lula quita dívida de R$4,6 bilhões com ONU e instituições estrangeiras",

The ministry vowed to bolster its self-defense capabilities in response. The Pentagon announced that the U.S. State Department approved the potential sale, estimated at $3.5 billion. The approval includes related logistics and support. A senior official from North Korea condemned the sale, calling it a reckless act that exacerbates regional instability.

    "title": "3 Stocks That Could Increase Their Dividend Payments in January",
    "text": "Investing in dividend growth stocks is one way to create a life-changing passive income portfolio for retirement.\nDividend growth stocks are typically well-established companies that consistently grow their profits year after year. They predictably give shareholders a raise every year as their profits climb. And over time, they can produce market-beating returns.\nOver the last 50 years, stocks that initiated and increased their dividend outperformed the market with less volatility, according to research from Hartford Funds. So adding a few solid dividend growth stocks to your portfolio could provide a nice boost to your long-term returns.\nHere are three dividend growth stocks that could raise their dividends in January.\nDollar bills rolled up and stacked in increasing height.\n1. Comcast Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) has raised its dividend for 15 straight years, typically announcing the new dividend payment with the release of its fourth-quarter earnings results. The company will release the results of its 2023 fourth quarter on Jan. 25.\nWhile Comcast sits on a ton of debt, about $95 billion, that’s balanced by its massive cable business, which produces stable recurring revenue.\nTotal dividend payments amounted to $3.6 billion over the first nine months of 2023, barely moving higher from the previous year thanks to Comcast’s share repurchase program. Comcast bought back $7.8 billion worth of shares during the first three quarters. Combined, the two amount to practically all of its free cash flow.\nThe dividend is protected by the aggressive share repurchases and strong free cash flow at Comcast. Therefore, investors should expect yet another dividend increase when the company announces its fourth-quarter results.\n2. Chevron Chevron (NYSE: CVX) has increased its dividend for 36 straight years, managing through tough economic environments, including the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic before that. That’s largely owed to management’s focus on keeping its balance sheet in tip-top form.\nThe company keeps a relatively low debt level most of the time compared to its peers, and it keeps its capital expenditures in check. It’s well positioned to generate strong free cash flow from its existing assets, and a plan to acquire Hess in an all-stock deal could provide a boost to earnings and free cash flow next year.\nTotal dividend payments amounted to $8.5 billion through the first nine months of 2023, up slightly from $8.3 billion in 2022. Share repurchases accelerated to $11.5 billion, using up excess cash on the balance sheet while it works to turn around free cash flow growth. With expectations for lower capital expenditures and higher margins in the future, investors should expect a strong recovery in free cash flow generation.\nInvestors should see yet another dividend increase when Chevron announces its fourth-quarter financial results.\n3. BlackRock BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) has increased its dividend every year but one since initiating it in 2003. The lone year it didn’t raise the dividend? 2009, following the Great Recession.\nBlackRock’s balance sheet looks fantastic, with $7.1 billion in cash and $4.7 billion in unencumbered investments relative to about $7.9 billion in long-term debt. As an asset manager, BlackRock is more susceptible to market swings than other companies, so free cash flow isn’t as consistent as in some other industries.\nNonetheless, BlackRock’s dividend is well protected. Around half of its capital return program currently goes toward share repurchases. That leaves plenty of room for the company to keep raising its dividend year after year as its assets under management grow due to asset price appreciation and continued inflows of new money.\nInvestors should expect management to announce an increased annual dividend before the end of January if it doesn’t announce with its fourth-quarter earnings release.\nIt pays to dig deeper on dividend growth stocks Finding a great dividend growth stock requires more than just finding a company that’s consistently raised its dividend. You need to be sure the company will be able to continue raising its dividend for years to come.\nThese companies look well positioned to do just that, but not every company that’s raised its dividend can afford to keep doing so. So be sure to dig into the company’s financials and research the outlook for the future before diving in, no matter how many years a stock has increased its dividend.\nSPONSORED:\nShould you invest $1,000 in Comcast right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Comcast, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Comcast wasn’t one of them.

    "text": "¿Sabías que el limón es un excelente agente natural para eliminar el moho? Esto se debe a que tiene propiedades ácidas y antimicrobianas efectivas contra estos hongos. Recordemos que el moho es un tipo de hongo que se forma debido a la humedad, la falta de ventilación y a la presencia de materia orgánica, de la cual se alimenta como la madera, el papel, el cartón, el yeso, entre otros materiales comunes en el hogar. Sigue leyendo: [Chinches en tu casa: este es el detergente que las mata al instante](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/estilo-de-vida/2024/7/15/chinches-en-tu-casa-este-es-el-detergente-que-las-mata-al-instante-620883.html) [Esta es la poderosa razón por la que la manzanilla es la mejor opción para conciliar el sueño](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/estilo-de-vida/2024/7/11/esta-es-la-poderosa-razon-por-la-que-la-manzanilla-es-la-mejor-opcion-para-conciliar-el-sueno-620251.html) Es común encontrar moho en los baños, en la cocina, en las áreas de lavado, en las ventanas, los arcos de las puertas, las paredes, los techos y en objetos guardados; se ven como manchas negras, verdes o incluso naranjas. Para evitar la formación de moho, debes ventilar adecuadamente las áreas propensas a acumular humedad y reparar inmediatamente las fugas de agua. Sin embargo, si ya notas la presencia de moho en varias zonas de tu hogar puedes utilizar el limón para librarte de estos hongos. A continuación te decimos cómo. ¿Cómo usar el limón para eliminar el moho? - Mezcla, por igual, agua de la llave con jugo de limón, en la cantidad que consideres necesaria para las áreas de tu hogar que desees limpiar. Por ejemplo, si exprimes varios limones y obtienes 100 ml de jugo de limón, mézclalo con 100 ml de agua; si obtienes 150 ml de jugo de limón, lo mezclas con 150 ml de agua, y así sucesivamente. - Una vez que tengas la mezcla, viértelo en un rociador para poder aplicar la solución de mejor manera, y espárcela directamente sobre las áreas afectadas con moho; asegúrate de cubrir bien todas las zonas. - Deja actuar la solución de limón sobre el moho durante 10 minutos, para permitir que el ácido del limón penetre y mate el hongo. - Posteriormente, limpia el área con un trapo limpio o una esponja para quitar tanto la solución de limón como los restos del moho. - Enjuaga con agua para eliminar cualquier residuo que haya quedado y seca con un trapo seco o deja que se seque con el ambiente. Verás como quedan limpias tus áreas del hogar y libres de moho. Un consejo adicional que te damos es que si ves que el moho persiste, vuelve a aplicar el jugo del limón, pero esta vez directamente sin diluir con agua, debe funcionar efectivamente; solo ten cuidado porque el limón puede ser corrosivo con ciertos materiales delicados. Finalmente, no olvides ventilar tu casa para evitar que reaparezca el moho.",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.",

    "text": "Winter Weather conditions causes safety hazards for drivers QUINCY (WGEM) - Winter weather has made roads and bridges across the Tri-States very slippery which has led to several accidents already. Drivers often get in a hurry and are not paying attention on the road causing a lot of accidents around this time of year. Winter weather conditions can cause a variety of safety hazards for drivers. “As soon as it drops to 32 degrees or right in that area with a little bit of mist and rain we had last night it’s going to make icy spots,” said Canton Fire Chief Joe LaCount. Taking extra precautions when those conditions arrive in the Tri-states can make a big difference. “So that makes it harder to drive in and as always visibility is lower at times so you got to be more cautious and paying attention to people around you and what’s going on,” said Adams County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Logan Peter. Officials said during the winter, it’s best to give yourself plenty of driving time to ensure your safety. “When the temperature drops its best to drop your speed a little and really pay attention to the road conditions ahead of you,” LaCount said. Bridges and overpasses are also very dangerous during winter weather conditions since icy spots can be difficult for drivers to see. “Cold air can often get under the roadway there and it causes the moisture on the road to freeze so they’ll freeze before other parts of the roadway will,” Peter said. “So when you’re on the highway and you come out from underneath an overpass or bridge the roads can change really quickly right there,” LaCount said. To avoid any accidents you should plan you trips ahead of time and always be sure to check the weather conditions before you leave. “Give yourself an extra few minutes to get to where you’re going, leave in plenty of time and expect to need to drive slower to where you’re going,” Peter said. First responders advise drivers to make sure vehicles get regularly serviced and prepped for winter weather conditions before driving to ensure smoother travels. Copyright 2023 WGEM.
