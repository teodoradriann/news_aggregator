    "title": "Migros Neuchâtel-Fribourg: victoire au pénal de Damien Piller",
    "text": "L'avocat et promoteur immobilier fribourgeois Damien Piller signe une victoire définitive dans le volet pénal du conflit l'opposant à Migros Neuchâtel-Fribourg (MNF), dont il a été président de 1996 à 2020. Le Tribunal fédéral (TF) a rejeté un recours de la coopérative régionale. «Le recours doit être rejeté dans la faible mesure où il est recevable», a noté la 2e Cour de droit pénal. La décision vient confirmer un arrêt de la Chambre pénale du Tribunal cantonal fribourgeois (TC) du 5 janvier, suite à la contestation d'une ordonnance de classement du 9 janvier 2023 du Ministère public (MP). En janvier 2023, le procureur général du canton de Fribourg Fabien Gasser avait conclu que l'enquête et les auditions menées par la brigade financière de la police de sûreté n’avaient pas démontré que Damien Piller aurait passer des conventions assurant des revenus indus au détriment de Migros, à deux entreprises de construction se trouvant dans le giron du promoteur. En juillet 2019, les responsables de la FCM et de MNF avaient accusé l'homme d'affaires de s’être enrichi dans le cadre des chantiers, achevés en 2014 et 2015, des magasins Migros de Belfaux et La Roche. Leur réalisation avait été confiée aux sociétés Anura SA, aux mains de Damien Piller, et Constructor SA, dont il avait fait l’acquisition quelques mois après l’achèvement des travaux. Migros avait conclu une convention avec ces deux entreprises, l’obligeant à verser à chacune un montant de 800 000 francs plus la TVA à 8%, soit un montant total de 1,8 million, à titre de «participation à la réalisation des différentes infrastructures qui doivent être construites pour accueillir Migros». D’après le géant orange, ces montants auraient été versés sans aucune contre-prestation, ce que Damien Piller a toujours contesté. Selon lui, une aile du bâtiment de Belfaux avait dû être surélevée et un parking souterrain, pas prévu dans le projet initial, avait été construit à La Roche. Le TC a rappelé dans son arrêt que ce sont bien les organes de MNF, et non le promoteur fribourgeois, qui ont validé et signé les conventions litigieuses. Les juges ne se sont en revanche pas prononcés sur la question des contre-prestations, qui devra le cas échéant être tranchée par un tribunal civil (Arrêt 7B_182/2024). (ats/jch) En 2023, le nombre de paiements effectués avec Twint aux caisses des magasins suisses a presque doublé par rapport à l'année précédente. Cela s'explique sans doute en partie par le fait que les utilisateurs peuvent, depuis quelque temps, enregistrer la Supercard Coop dans l'application de paiement et collecter des points de fidélité en payant avec Twint, sans avoir à sortir leur carte de fidélité. Mais jusqu'à présent, seules quelques-unes pouvaient être enregistrées dans l'application. Cela va changer.",

    "title": "Unveiling New Fossils: Diverse Terrestrial Ecosystems 75,000 Years Post-Permian Extinction",
    "text": "A Glimmer of Hope: Ancient ‘ Life Oasis ‘ Weathered the Greatest Extinction Amidst growing concerns about a potential sixth mass extinction, a groundbreaking discovery offers a beacon of hope. Paleontologists have unearthed fossil evidence of a thriving ecosystem that persisted through the end-Permian mass extinction, the most devastating biotic crisis in Earth’s history. This “Life Oasis,” as researchers call it, provides invaluable insights into how life can endure even the most catastrophic events and offers practical lessons for contemporary conservation efforts.\nUnearthing a Lost World in Xinjiang, China Located in the Turpan-Hami Basin of Xinjiang province, northwestern China, the South Taodonggou section has revealed a remarkable story of resilience. While marine ecosystems collapsed during the end-Permian extinction,this region harbored vibrant gymnospermous forests and fern fields. Researchers meticulously analyzed plant, tetrapod, and microfossils, piecing together a picture of an ecosystem that defied the odds.\nArtistic reconstruction of the terrestrial ecological landscape during, before, and after the end of the Permian mass extinction based on fossil palynomorphs, plants, and tetrapods recovered, as well as sedimentological data from the South taodonggou section in Xinjiang, China. (Image credit: D.H. Yang)\nThe End-Permian Extinction: A Cataclysmic Event The end-Permian mass extinction, which occurred approximately 252 million years ago, decimated life on Earth. It is “widely recognized as the most severe among the five major Phanerozoic extinctions,” wiping out an estimated 80% of known species, especially in marine environments. The leading theory attributes this devastation to massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia, unleashing a torrent of wildfires, acid rain, and toxic gases.\nA Refuge from the Storm While other regions succumbed to the environmental upheaval, the South Taodonggou section thrived. Professor mingli Wan of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, noted, “The presence of intact tree trunks and fern stems further confirms that these microfossils represent local vegetation, not transported remnants.” This suggests a stable, local ecosystem rather than a collection of displaced flora.\nThe data indicates a surprisingly low extinction rate of spore and pollen species in the area, around 21%, substantially less than the contemporaneous marine extinction rate. This lower rate, combined with the reappearance of “missing” species in later Early Triassic layers, suggests that many species migrated temporarily rather than becoming permanently extinct.\nRapid Ecosystem Recovery : A Testament to Resilience The stable vegetation base proved crucial for the rapid recovery of the local ecosystem. Within a mere 75,000 years after the extinction event, diverse tetrapods, including the herbivorous Lystrosaurus and carnivorous chroniosuchians, populated the area. This remarkably swift recovery stands in stark contrast to previous estimates suggesting that ecosystem recovery after the end-permian extinction took over a million years. The new evidence indicates a recovery rate more than ten times faster in this region than elsewhere.\nThe Secret to Survival: A Stable, Semi-Humid Climate The key to South Taodonggou’s resilience appears to lie in its stable, semi-humid climate.Analysis of paleosol matrices reveals consistent rainfall of approximately 1,000 mm per year. This steady precipitation fostered abundant vegetation,providing a habitable surroundings for migrating animals seeking refuge from the harsh conditions elsewhere.\nLessons for Today: Protecting Our ‘Life Oases’ Professor Feng Liu,also from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology,emphasizes the importance of this discovery for modern conservation: “This suggests that local climate and geographic factors can create surprising pockets of resilience,offering hope for conservation efforts in the face of global environmental change.” He adds that “In light of current concerns about a potential sixth mass extinction driven by human activity, the discovery of this ‘Life Oasis’ highlights the importance of identifying and protecting such natural refugia.”\nActionable takeaways and Future Implications Identify and Protect Refugia: Prioritize the identification and protection of regions with stable climates and diverse ecosystems that coudl serve as refugia during periods of environmental stress. Invest in Climate Resilience: Focus on strategies to enhance the resilience of ecosystems to climate change, such as restoring degraded habitats and promoting biodiversity. Reduce Human Impact: Mitigate the drivers of human-induced environmental change, including greenhouse gas emissions, habitat destruction, and pollution. Promote International Collaboration: Foster collaboration among scientists, policymakers, and conservation organizations to address global environmental challenges effectively. The discovery of the South Taodonggou “Life Oasis” is a powerful reminder that life on Earth possesses remarkable resilience. By learning from the past and taking proactive steps to protect our planet’s biodiversity, we can increase the chances of navigating future environmental challenges and preserving life for generations to come. Consider supporting organizations dedicated to conservation and advocating for policies that promote environmental sustainability. The future of our planet may depend on it.\nhow did the stable, semi-humid climate contribute to the resilience of the “Life Oasis” ecosystem during the end-Permian extinction?\nA Conversation with Dr. Aris Thorne: Insights from the “Life Oasis” At Archyde, we’re always looking for breakthroughs that offer hope.Today, we’re speaking with Dr. Aris Thorne, a paleobotanist specializing in Permian-Triassic boundary events, about the exciting discovery of a “Life oasis” in xinjiang, China, and its implications for understanding mass extinctions and modern conservation.\nUnearthing Resilience: The South Taodonggou Discovery Archyde: Dr. Thorne, thank you for joining us. This “Life Oasis” find sounds incredible. for our readers unfamiliar with the specifics, could you paint a picture of what the South Taodonggou section looked like during the end-Permian extinction?\nDr.Thorne: Certainly. Imagine a world ravaged by volcanic eruptions, acid rain, and widespread devastation. Yet, within the Turpan-Hami Basin, this region, the South Taodonggou, offered a refuge. Think of relatively lush gymnosperm forests and fern fields. Fossil evidence shows intact tree trunks and fern stems, indicating it was a stable local ecosystem, not just a collection of debris relocated from elsewhere. It was a green island in an or else bleak world.\nThe End-Permian Extinction: Understanding the Scale of Devastation Archyde: The end-Permian extinction, often called “The Great Dying,” was truly catastrophic. How does this discovery challenge our understanding of how ecosystems responded to such extreme environmental upheaval?\nDr. Thorne: The prevailing view was that ecosystem recovery after the end-Permian extinction took over a million years. This site shows a recovery rate over ten times faster than previously thought in at least some regions.It suggests that, under the right conditions, ecosystems possess a remarkable capacity to rebound much quicker than we presumed which is highly notable for our understanding of mass extinctions and how life can survive\nSecrets of Survival: Climate and Geographic Factors Archyde: What do you believe were the critical factors that allowed this ecosystem to weather the storm when so many others perished?\nDr. Thorne: The research points to a stable, semi-humid climate as the key. Paleosol analysis suggests consistent rainfall, approximately 1,000 mm per year. This sustained precipitation fueled abundant vegetation, offering a habitable environment for migrating animals fleeing harsher conditions elsewhere. So, relatively unaffected climate and geographic isolation played a crucial role fostering climate resilience.\nLessons for Today: Conservation in the Face of a Potential Sixth extinction Archyde: Professor Feng Liu emphasized the importance of this discovery for modern conservation. What are the most actionable takeaways from this research for today’s conservation efforts?\nDr.Thorne: Firstly, prioritizing the identification and protection of regions with stable climates and diverse ecosystems that could act as refugia during periods of extreme environmental stress is paramount. Secondly, efforts should focus on promoting the climate resilience of existing ecosystems for climate change adaptation. supporting organizations dedicated to conservation and advocating for policies that champion environmental sustainability is essential.\nA thought Provoking Question Archyde: Dr. Thorne, this discovery offers a glimmer of hope amidst a lot of environmental anxiety. If you could communicate one key message about this finding to the general public, what would it be? And what role do you think everyday individuals can play in preserving ‘Life Oases’ and fostering resilience?\nDr. Thorne: life possesses an extraordinary capacity for resilience. The South Taodonggou “Life Oasis” illustrates that.As for what individuals can do, increasing your environmental awareness, making conscious consumption choices to reduce your carbon footprint, supporting policies geared towards greenhouse gas reduction and habitat restoration, and, last but not least, educating others about climate effects and resilience will greatly increase our success\nArchyde: Thank you, Dr. Thorne, for sharing your insights.It’s discoveries like these that remind us of the importance of understanding our planet’s past to safeguard its future. We encourage our readers to share their thoughts on this discovery and discuss what actions they can take to support conservation efforts in the comments below.",

    "text": "A Democrat-led town council in Connecticut voted against a motion to fly the Thin Blue Line flag at in honor of a state trooper killed in the line of duty last week. Aaron Pelletier, Trooper First Class, was killed last week while conducting a traffic stop on a state highway. A car hit Pelletier, his squad car, and the car he&#039;d pulled over. The officer died from his injuries at the scene. Thousands of people have subsequently paid tribute to the 34-year-old father of two young boys, but Democrats on the Wethersfield town council voted on Monday not to fly the Thin Blue Line flag in his honor, which had been suggested by councilmember Rich Bailey. The motion failed by a vote of 5-3, which came after the council had already agreed to fly a Pride Flag for the duration of June. Aaron Pelletier (top left), Trooper First Class, was killed last week while conducting a traffic stop on a state highway. He leaves behind his wife, Dominique (top right) and two young sons [video_shortcode_video_html_5 src=&quot;https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/06/6571725332899606659/1024x576_MP4_6571725332899606659.mp4&quot;] At the meeting on Monday, Emily Zambrello, a Democratic member of the council said of the Thin Blue Line flag: &#039;That flag was either created or at least became prevalent in direct response to the Black Lives Matter protests, which were fueled in part by the killing of George Floyd by police. &#039;It’s viewed as antagonistic even if you don’t see it that way and I don’t think that’s a good flag to fly, especially not without further discussion.&#039; Fellow councilmember Brianna Timbro, a Republican, argued that the Thin Blue Line flag existed well before the Black Lives Matter protests and bears no relation to the Police Lives Matter movement, which Zambrello was referring to. Read More Widow&amp;#x27;s heartbreak as Connecticut State Trooper is killed during traffic stop At the Pride ceremony at Wethersfield Town Hall on Tuesday morning, the rainbow LGBTQ+ flag flew at half-mast to honor Pelletier&#039;s sacrifice. &#039;We won&#039;t be raising the pride flag today. It&#039;s already up on the pole at half-staff in honor of his passing,&#039; said state representative Amy Morrin Bello as she spoke at the ceremony. Governor Ned Lamont, a Democrat, was in attendance at the ceremony. He had previously directed state flags to be flown at half-mast to honor Pelletier. When asked what the Thin Blue Line flag means to her, Zambrello said it &#039;represents racism and antagonism to many, many people.&#039; &#039;It&#039;s not appropriate to raise above out Town Hall, especially when our flag policy prohibits us from doing anything associated with hate,&#039; she added. She also said that it does not matter if the Thin Blue Line flag means something different to some people, who choose to fly it on their personal property as a sign of solidarity with the law enforcement community. UNFREAKINGBELIEVABLE Democrats in CT voted against flying the American blue line flag to honor fallen officer Aaron Pelletier who was kiIIed in the line of duty. Instead they flew the pride flag at half staff to honor him. The pride flag. I have no words. This is disgraceful.… https://t.co/J0jLfj7j6l pic.twitter.com/7qJQ9oZqSA — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) June 6, 2024 When asked what the Thin Blue Line flag means to her, Democratic councilwoman Emily Zambrello (pictured) said it &#039;represents racism and antagonism to many, many people,&#039; and added that it doesn&#039;t matter if others believe the flag is a way to honor the men in blue While some town residents commended the decision of he council agreeing that the Thin Blue Line flag is racist, others harshly condemned the group and said they will remember this action when election day arrives Some councilmembers contested the decision, arguing that the Thin Blue Line flag existed well before the Black Lives Matter protests and bears no relation to the Police Lives Matter movement Social media commentator Libs of TikTok highlighted the incident on her well-trafficked account, writing: &#039;Watch fallen state trooper Aaron Pelletier’s wife honor her husband. Aaron leaves behind a loving wife and 2 young children who will now grow up without a father. &#039;Democrats led by Emily Zambrello decided to fly the PRIDE FLAG at half staff to honor Aaron. They refused a request to fly the American thin blue line flag because it “represents racism and antagonism.” &#039;This is how Democrats honor a fallen officer. How degrading and disrespectful. There’s no low for them.&#039; Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a staunch defender of the law enforcement community, responded to Libs of TikTok&#039;s post, simply writing: &#039;This is ridiculous.&#039; Some Wethersfield residents expressed their discontent with the council&#039;s decision by commenting on the town&#039;s Facebook page. &#039;What disgusting behavior! The people who voted to not fly the blue line flag are hopefully voted out of office. When it comes time to vote, remember this,&#039; wrote Sheila Bekker Ierardi. &#039;They approve a sex flag but deny a police flag honoring a murdered Trooper. Shameful and Disgusting,&#039; wrote Bob Smith. &#039;Democrats hate the police,&#039; said Martin Riggs. And finally, &#039;Weak politicians are exactly why the pos who killed him were free to do so in the first place. What an absolute disgrace of a town,&#039; wrote Kiana Marie.
