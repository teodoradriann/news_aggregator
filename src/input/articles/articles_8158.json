    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "PFU accumulates astronomical debt regarding Chernobyl pensions: the amount named. More than 161 thousand court decisions have been accumulated by the Pension Fund of Ukraine regarding Chernobyl pensions As of August 1 of the current year, the Pension Fund of Ukraine has over 161 thousand court decisions obligating it to pay those affected by the Chernobyl disaster. This was reported by the Fund in response to a request from the publication \"Economic Truth\". These court decisions relate to the increase of pensions for non-working pensioners living in radiation-contaminated areas. To settle the debt according to these decisions, the state must allocate 17.2 billion hryvnias from the budget. The situation is causing serious concern as it affects people who suffered from the consequences of the largest man-made disaster of the 20th century. Although nearly four decades have passed since the Chernobyl NPP accident, its consequences continue to affect the lives and health of thousands of Ukrainians. Earlier, Human Rights Commissioner Dmytro Lubinets stated that the total debt of the state is nearly 70 billion hryvnias regarding court decisions on pension payments in Ukraine.

    "text": "\"Ca valait le coup d'attendre\" : l'armée suédoise salue son entrée dans l'Otan Des soldats d'élite de l'armée suédoise se frottent les mains près de leur véhicule blindé, lors d'un exercice militaire de l'Otan vendredi dans l'Arctique norvégien. Et le froid n'explique pas tout. Ces soldats suédois sont aussi très satisfaits de participer, enfin à part entière, à cet exercice militaire de grande envergure, le premier depuis que leur pays est officiellement devenu jeudi le 32e membre de l'Alliance atlantique. L'invasion russe de l'Ukraine le 24 février 2022 a décidé la Suède à renoncer à 200 ans de neutralité pour rejoindre l'Otan. Non sans mal. La Turquie et la Hongrie, pour des raisons différentes, s'y sont opposé pendant deux ans avant de lever leur veto au début de cette année. \"Je pense que ça valait vraiment le coup d'attendre\", déclare à l'AFP Karl-Johan Ryden, 21 ans, l'officier suédois commandant l'un des navires participant dans le nord de la Norvège à cet exercice militaire. \"C'était un très long processus\", renchérit le commandant Joakim Sjögren. \"Mais on a toujours cru que ce serait un oui en définitive, donc on s'était préparé à cela\", ajoute-t-il. Le Nordic Response exercise (exercice de réponse nordique), fait partie de l'opération Steadfast, le plus important exercice militaire lancé par l'Otan depuis la fin de la guerre froide, avec quelque 90.000 hommes et femmes mobilisés. - \"L'adhésion élimine des obstacles\" - Et si la Suède y participe cette fois à part entière, ce n'est pas la première fois que son armée se retrouve aux côtés des Alliés pour un exercice militaire ou une mission de l'Otan. \"Je dirai qu'au niveau tactique, au niveau des unités, pour les soldats et les officiers, il n'y a pas vraiment de gros changements, parce que nous nous entraînons avec l'Otan ou participons à des opérations de l'Alliance depuis les années 2000\", a expliqué de son côté le commandant suédois pour les opérations conjointes, Carl-Johan Edström. \"Mais pour la Suède en général, il s'agit bien sûr d'un gros changement. C'est le plus important depuis 200 ans, un vrai changement d'état d'esprit\", a-t-il ajouté. Le vice-amiral norvégien Rune Andersen estime de son côté que l'adhésion de la Suède à l'Otan, après celle de la Finlande l'an dernier, ouvre \"une nouvelle ère dans la manière de coopérer en matière de défense dans la région nordique\". \"Nous travaillons ensemble depuis longtemps, mais l'adhésion élimine beaucoup d'obstacles\", souligne-t-il depuis le pont d'un navire des garde-côtes norvégiens. Selon ce gradé norvégien, la Suède peut maintenant être totalement intégrée aux plans de défense de l'Otan, ce qui n'était pas le cas auparavant. Et surtout, elle va désormais bénéficier de la protection de l'article 5 du traité de l'Atlantique nord, qui a créé l'Otan en 1949. - Position stratégique - Pilier de l'Alliance, cet article prévoit l'obligation pour chaque pays membre, y compris la Suède, d'aider les autres alliés en cas d'attaque, a encore expliqué cet officier norvégien. Et pour le vice-amiral américain Douglas Perry, à la tête du Norfolk Command de l'Otan qui contrôle l'Atlantique et les régions arctiques, l'adhésion de la Suède va permettre à l'Alliance de l'intégrer totalement à ses scénarios de défense contre la menace russe. Et sur ce point, \"ils mettent beaucoup de choses sur la table\", a-t-il affirmé, en soulignant la position stratégique de la Suède dans les Mers baltique et arctique. La Suède a décidé de rejoindre l'Otan au moment où la perspective d'un conflit entre la Russie et les Alliés semble désormais moins éloignée depuis l'invasion russe de l'Ukraine. A bord d'un navire de guerre suédois, la nouvelle recrue Vera Nylander, appuyée sur sa mitrailleuse, garde cependant tout son sang froid. \"Je prendrai les choses comme elles viennent\", affirme-t-elle avec flegme. \"Je pense que nous sommes prêts, on s'est entraîné pour cela, si cela doit se produire\".
