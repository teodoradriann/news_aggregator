    "text": "Did Rams Send a Message to the Rest of the NFL After Wild Card Win?\nThe Los Angeles Rams started their playoff run with a bang on Monday Night in Arizona. The Rams were no match for the Minnesota Vikings, with the Rams taking the Vikings down in the Wild Card game on Monday Night in dominant fashion. From start to finish it was all about the team from Los Angeles. And it was a complete team performance.\nThe Rams defense was a huge reason the team made the playoffs this season. The only question that was left was whether this young defense was ready for the bright lights that are the NFL Playoffs. They were all ready including veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford and the offensive. They did not miss a beat and had their best performance of the season.\nMany have not put the Rams in the conversion of having a chance to even make the playoffs, let alone make a run to another Super Bowl. Not only did the Rams get in but they sent yet another message in their Wild Card wins over the Vikings.\nThe Rams are here in these playoffs to win it all. This is a team that has been disrespected all season but they do not care about the outside noise. They instead go and prove on the field that they are the real deal. It has opened many eyes across the NFL at what the Rams are currently doing.\n\"Absolutely, the Rams sent the message that they are a problem,\" said former NFL wider receiver James Jones on The Facility. \"And the main reason they are a problem as great as the defense played is Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay and that offense. They have shown you, that they are going to put up points, we can still move this ball. Matthew Stafford is playing as an elite quarterback in this league. He is a step ahead of the Minnesota Vikings defense when they were bringing pressure, when they were in a zone, whatever it is.\"\n\"And to put on top of that, the way the defense played. This young pass rush, this front seven has gotten a lot better since they last saw the Philadelphia Eagles. But the main reason is the quarterback. I truly believe the quarterback is why you win playoff games and get to a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford is one of those quarterbacks. They are absolutely a problem and sent a message.\"\nEnsure you follow on X (Twitter) @RamsInsideronSI and @MNSToday and never miss another breaking news story again.\nPlease let us know your thoughts when you like our Facebook page WHEN YOU CLICK RIGHT HERE",

    "title": "Anti-Semitism: A Central Feature in Leftist Thought",
    "text": "Robert S. Wistrich was the Neuburger Professor of European and Jewish history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the director of the university’s Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism. He may also have been the leading academic authority on anti-Semitism. Witness his histories\nA Lethal Obsession: Anti-Semitism From Antiquity to the Global Jihad(2010) and From Ambivalence to Betrayal: The Left, The Jews and Israel (2012). Professor Wistrich died in 2015 at the age of 70. The New York Times obituary by Sam Roberts is here. Would that he were alive in this hour.\nI interviewed Professor Wistrich by email in connection with his 2012 book. It occurred to me that it might be a good time to revisit the interview. Here it is.\nPL: You begin your new book with an autobiographical account dating back to your time on the Left. How did you get from there to here, so to speak?\nRSW: I belonged, at one point, to the radical 1968 generation in the West who were intoxicated (in my case, briefly) with the secular utopianism of radical Marxism and the mirage of “cultural revolution.” I was physically present in Paris when the French students shouted “We are all German Jews” in support of their leader “Dany the Red,” who had just been prevented by De Gaulle from returning from Germany to France. Today, their equivalents in Europe might well be shouting “Death to Israel” or “Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!” That is one strand of the journey that led me to retrospectively subject the contemporary Left to intense critical scrutiny.\nPL: Would you talk a little bit about your scholarly interest in the subject of anti-Semitism?\nRSW: Ever since I was a student at Cambridge University in the late 1960s (and probably much earlier), I have been both intrigued and repulsed by the sheer persistence of anti-Semitism in its many forms. Living as I did in Great Britain for the first thirty years of my life, I always felt an outsider and my Jewish identity was clearly part of that. The more that I subsequently studied the history of Jew-hatred, the more I began to see it as an embedded part of the cultural DNA of the West (especially of European history). The return of anti-Semitism in our time – much of it under the guise of loathing Israel – has confirmed for me its near-ubiquity and perennial nature. But already in 1991, I had invented the term “the longest hatred” to describe its extraordinary tenacity.\nPL: What would you like prospective readers to know about your book?\nRSW: I believe that my most recent book does expose for the first time in such a systematic fashion the enduring Judeophobic passions prevalent in so many left-wing revolutionary movements; the emptiness of the dream of “proletarian solidarity”; and the political fantasy-world of Communist egalitarianism, some of it ardently espoused by Jewish intellectuals. Moreover, my book unmistakably shows that conspiracy theories are as much a proclivity of the Left as of the Right. I see it as a much-needed demystification of all the standard leftist stereotypes and delusions about the Jews and Israel, whose exposure is long overdue.\nPL: Would you briefly summarize your findings for us?\nRSW: One of the key points in my study is that anti-Semitism has been an important feature of left-wing thought ever since its beginnings in the 1840s with Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. This animosity derives in part from a distorted post-Christian Enlightenment perception of Judaism as a fundamentally reactionary tribalist religion and an obstacle to “human emancipation”; from a grossly simplistic identification of Jews with banks, money, financial speculation and capitalist injustices; as well as a stubborn refusal in our own time to recognize the indubitably national character of the Jewish people and the overwhelming historic legitimacy of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel.\nPL: What role did the Soviet Union play in creating the current anti-Semitism and its tropes?\nRSW: The Soviet Union may have collapsed in 1991 but twenty years later, we can still see in the West, the Middle East and in the Third World the truly poisonous legacy of its vile demonology concerning the Jews and Israel. All the more malevolent and mendacious amalgams of our own day, equating Zionism with racism, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, fascism, Nazism and the totally imaginary “genocide” of the Palestinians were originally concoctions of the Soviet propaganda apparatus. That is rarely understood and mostly forgotten.\nPL: What has been the response of the Left to your book? Silence or disagreement?\nRSW: Not surprisingly, there are few on the Left willing or able to accept the challenge that I’ve thrown down to them or to revise their tired and worn-out dogmas. The last thing that one can accuse the leftists I write about (and their heirs) of being is open-minded or self-critical.\nPL: How does left-wing anti-Semitism fit into the history of anti-Semitism?\nRSW: Left-wing anti-Semitism is a consistently underrated feature of the history of Jew-hatred since the mid-19th century. One aspect that makes it rather unusual is that it usually adopts a secular, rationalist and “universalist” standpoint; that it purports to be humanistic and in its “anti-Zionist” mutation usually clothes itself in the banner of human rights and preaches defense of the “oppressed” – especially the Palestinians. This world-view sounds nice on paper but in practice it does not immunize leftists from falling into a morass of self-delusion, bias and prejudice against Jews or Israelis, even though this is often vehemently contested. This is an anti-Semitism which denies its name.\nPL: Do you see an alliance between the Left and Islamists based on their shared hatreds? If so, would you elaborate on that?\nRSW: The radical Left and the Islamists do share a common hatred of the West (especially America) and of Israel as symbols of successful modernity, entrepreneurial capitalism and secular freedoms. They increasingly align with one another over “solidarity” with Palestine, rejection of any American involvement in the Middle East, and in their efforts to subvert the moral foundations of Western culture. Such is the potency of these irrational hatreds that they even trump the Left’s traditional support for causes like women’s emancipation and gay rights – which are total anathema to Islamists.\nPL: What is at stake for those of us outside Israel in the Islamist war against Israel?\nRSW: The Islamist onslaught against Israel is to a considerable extent a war by proxy against the West – in which defense of the Jewish State becomes the litmus-test for Islamic probing whether the Western world is really serious about commitment to its core-values of individual freedom and liberal democracy. The Islamic radicals are today not only the spearhead of an annihilationist anti-Jewish ideology but also of a fanatical jihadist war against civilization as it has hitherto been understood in the West.\nPL: Anything else you’d like to add?\nRSW: In conclusion, I would simply add that the contemporary Left can no longer claim any kind of moral high ground. It has never truly come to terms with the abominable crimes of the Stalinist regimes, with the Soviet Gulag and Communist totalitarianism. Its uncritical and selective solidarity with “victims” like the Palestinians is highly suspect; its relentless efforts to blacken the good name of America and Israel at all costs are often grotesque; its frequent whitewashing of Islamic extremism and naked terrorism are morally reprehensible; and its Judeophobic legacy requires urgent detoxification. Anti-Semitism, I would maintain, has always been a remarkably accurate barometer for measuring bigoted, prejudiced and dogmatic attitudes, not to mention blatant double standards. Much of the contemporary Left, when it comes to the Jews and especially to Israel, has miserably failed the test of elementary honesty and intellectual integrity.",

    "text": "Girls for Gender Equity, a Brooklyn-based advocacy organization focused on uplifting Black girls and gender non-conforming youth, released a new report showing room for potential reform in school dress codes across New York City.\nThis report follows the enactment of Local Law 083 of 2024, a law aimed at mitigating the alleged discriminatory impacts of existing dress code policies.\nGGE’s report, the third in a series examining dress code policies, analyzed compliance across all five boroughs of New York City. The results indicated that schools achieved an average score of 60% in complying with the Department of Education’s guidelines concerning dress codes. Brooklyn schools showed the highest compliance scores, averaging a grade of B, while Bronx schools scored the lowest with an average grade of D.\nQuaidra Coles, director of policy advocacy for GGE, explained the impetus behind the focused research.\n“We initiated this project to bolster our advocacy efforts for Local Law 083, which has been on the table for five years. The time for action is now, especially as school budgets and priorities shift post-pandemic,” she told amNewYork Metro.\nThe latest report identified systemic issues in dress code enforcement, finding that many policies are not accessible or clearly communicated to students and their families. Photo courtesy of Girls for Gender Equity. More than 40% of the schools examined either did not have their dress codes published on their websites or used ambiguous language, making it challenging for students to understand what was permissible.\n “How can students adhere to dress codes if they are not even aware of what those codes entail,” Coles added.\nPer the New York City Public Schools website , students are free to wear what they want unless the attire is dangerous, interferes with teaching and learning or violates the DOE’s anti-discrimination policy.\nSchools are also required to show justification for each dress requirement.\nA significant highlight of GGE’s findings includes the impact of dress codes on mental health. In interviews, students expressed that restrictive dress codes adversely affected their self-esteem and school attendance.\nFor example, a young participant shared with Coles that when they felt unable to present their authentic selves through clothing, it deterred them from attending school, which ultimately affected their academic performance. This correlation emphasizes the importance of allowing students the freedom to express themselves, as it can significantly enhance their engagement and well-being.\nThe study also found that dress codes often reflect underlying biases. Among the schools evaluated, those with punitive measures for dress code violations disproportionately targeted Black girls and gender non-conforming youth, leading to higher rates of suspension or removal from classrooms.\n“These policies are often enforced under the guise of mitigating distractions,” Coles said. “When in reality, they create an environment of exclusion.”\nWhile the report acknowledges the difficulty of implementing uniforms across NYC’s diverse school system, it advocates for a cultural shift in how educators perceive and enforce dress codes.\n“It’s essential for educators to understand the social dynamics influencing students’ clothing choices,” Coles said. “A collaborative approach that includes input from students and families can lead to healthier school environments.”\nGGE’s leadership goals for the coming year include continuing to advocate for meaningful policy changes and fostering dialogue between students and educators.\n“We need to ensure that young people feel empowered to express themselves, as this will positively impact their mental health and future decision-making,” Coles stated.",

    "text": "It’s been 22 years since Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan first swapped bodies in “Freaky Friday,” but they’re ready to do it again with a new generation in Disney’s “Freakier Friday,” out in theaters next month.\nAt Tuesday night’s world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, the Oscar-winning actress explained why audiences need feel-good movies like this highly anticipated sequel to the 2003 family classic now more than ever.\n“There’s math involved. You couldn’t make this movie if Lindsay didn’t have a teenage daughter, so she had to be old enough,” Curtis told TheWrap. “And there’s a nostalgia about the movie. In a time of turmoil, you cling to something nostalgic and familiar, so it’s like comfort food.”\n“I think ‘Freaky Friday’ is sort of cinema comfort food: it’s satisfying, makes you feel good, makes you laugh, makes you cry. You leave uplifted and you feel — because you’re in a theater with other people, not on a streamer — you’re not alone,” she added. “If there was ever a time in the world to feel united and not alone, it’s now.”\nMeanwhile, Disney Channel favorite and franchise newcomer Sophia Hammons opened up about getting to act alongside such iconic Hollywood legends .\n“I loved the first one. I was like 12 or 13 and I had a huge Avril Lavigne phase — still there — but Lindsay told me that her inspo for Anna’s streaks in her hair was Avril Lavigne. So, no wonder I connected with this movie so much, I wanted to be Anna. And now I’m Tess,” she shared. “The biggest thing is that we’re so lucky to do what we do and it’s incredible that I get to work alongside people that I’ve looked up to for so long and that I still do.”\nAlso joining the sequel cast is Manny Jacinto, who gets to star as Lohan’s love interest and the dad to Hammons’ character, Lily.\n“I was that kid that loved ‘Freaky Friday,’ ‘Mean Girls.’ To witness and be beside Lindsay during her Lohan-aissance is pretty wild,” he said. “There’s a reason why the ladies get paid the big bucks. Me and Chad are just happy to be on the sidelines and just wave our hair. It’s the ladies’ movie, they shine in it, and I can’t wait for everybody to see it.”\nThe Los Angeles event kicked off with an IRL performance of Pink Slip’s “Take Me Away” from the original movie, with an intro from the “Freakier Friday” cast. The post-screening afterparty featured a live 2000s cover band, open bars, buffets, chocolate milkshakes and DIY trucker hats, as well as brand activations and goodies from Club Pilates, Schwarzkopf, Secret, Swig Drinks, Brooklyn Charm and Walgreens.\nFellow cast members Julia Butters, Chad Michael Murray, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Rosalind Chao, Ryan Malgarini, Lucille Soong, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Elaine Hendrix, Vanessa Bayer, Chloe Fineman, Jordan Cooper, Kimberly Bigsby and X Mayo were also in attendance. Other notable guests included screenwriter Jordan Weiss, producer Kristin Burr, composer Amie Doherty, director Nisha Ganatra, Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman, Daniel Franzese, Lisa Ann Walter, Rachael Leigh Cook, Whitney Cummings, David Archuleta, Jake Thomas, Aubrey Anderson-Emmons and Maia Kealoha, to name a few.\n“Freakier Friday” finds itself in theaters on Aug. 8.",

    "text": "Thousands of doctors in England are staging their 11th walkout on Thursday in a long-running dispute with the government over pay and working conditions, disrupting hospital services just days before the U.K. general election.\nThe five-day strike by junior doctors — those in the early years of their careers — shines a spotlight on the troubles besetting the chronically underfunded National Health Service, Britain’s state-funded public health system, a topic that is a a top concern for voters going to the polls on July 4.\nJunior doctors, who form the backbone of hospital and clinic care, have been locked in the pay dispute with the government since late 2022. They went on strike for six days in January — the longest in NHS history — and hospitals had to cancel tens of thousands of appointments and operations.\nThe latest strike begins Thursday and ends on Tuesday, just two days before voters cast their ballots to choose a new House of Commons.\nThe British Medical Association, the doctors' union, say their pay has dropped by a quarter over the last 15 years and have called for a 35% pay uplift. The union says newly qualified doctors earn about 15 pounds ($19) an hour — the U.K. minimum wage is just over 10 pounds an hour — though salaries rise rapidly after the first year.\nDr. Sumi Manirajan, deputy chair of the junior doctors committee at the union, said that years of underinvestment has resulted in young doctors leaving in droves to countries that offer better pay, with those left behind seriously overworked and underpaid.\n“Doctors that I trained with in London, some of the best in the country, have left to go to New Zealand. And actually what it makes me think of is why am I not doing the same? I want to be valued for the work that I do,” she said.\nManirajan, who recently graduated and works in obstetrics and gynecology, added that she sees many women waiting for more than a year for routine procedures.\n“These patients are in pain, and it hurts us to see us see these patients come in again and again with the same problem that we know we could treat if we had enough doctors,” she said.\nThe Conservative government says it gave the doctors pay raises of between 8.1% to 10.3% last year and said that it was a generous settlement. It maintained that authorities can't make a pay offer during the preelection period but the union refused to call off the strikes.\nManirajan said that it was unfortunate that the government chose to call an election while knowing that the dispute was unresolved.\nThe medics' union said it was ready to talk, and it has already had some discussions with the opposition Labour Party, which has a considerable lead in polls.\n“It is difficult to comprehend how either the Conservative Party or the Labour Party can deliver on their manifesto commitment to recover NHS performance over the next Parliament without first ending the dispute,” said Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at The King’s Fund think tank.",
