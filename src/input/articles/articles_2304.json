    "text": "Viral News\nChinese parlour offers massage for Rs 109 only to ‘exceptional’ women who own iPhones, luxury cars\nA Shenzhen massage parlour is offering an exclusive 9-yuan massage but only for \"exceptionally outstanding\" women who meet one of 27 strict conditions. Check out the criteria list here!\nShenzhen: A massage parlour in Shenzhen, China, is offering an incredibly cheap massage service. However, to qualify, clients must be women and meet at least one of 27 strict conditions that prove they are “exceptionally outstanding”.\nThe parlour is promoting its exclusive 80-minute detox massage on a popular review app for just 9 yuan (Rs 108). Normally, such a session costs around 200 yuan (Rs 2,400). However, only certain women can avail the offer.\nCriteria to avail massage for Rs 109\nTo qualify, a woman must own a luxury car such as an Audi, Mercedes or Porsche. Using an iPhone 16 Pro Max or living in a high-end property also meets the criteria. Other eligible women include tech employees from Tencent or Huawei, doctors, bankers, social media influencers with over 500,000 followers and those who have travelled to Europe or the US, SCMP reported.\nThe shop’s promotional message states, “If you do not meet the conditions, keep working hard in 2025!” It claims the goal is to motivate women to achieve success.\nA staff member told the media that this low-priced service is strictly for Shenzhen’s “exceptionally outstanding women”. Customers must provide proof of their qualifications.\nOne anonymous customer, however, said the massage felt no different from a standard service.\nOffer sparks controversy\nThe cheap massage service offer has sparked controversy online. Some argue the parlour may be violating China’s Consumer Rights Protection Law, which guarantees fair trade. Others believe it’s simply a marketing gimmick. Many question why wealthy women would care about getting a 9-yuan massage. Some speculate the parlour targets high-spending clients to upsell expensive services later.\nSimilar identity-based promotional offers have appeared in China before. In August last year, a swimming club in Jiangsu province only allowed women under 45 with an education to join. The club claimed that they have “a high IQ and personal qualities”.\nClick for more latest Viral news. Also get top headlines and latest news from India and around the world at News9.",

    "text": "I'm a 22-year-old ecologist from Yorta Yorta land in northern Victoria. I have a passion for native bees and my work aims to [help bees in their urgent need for conservation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-08/native-bee-honey-bee-disease-parasite-research-qld/11392606). I'm researching native stingless bees in the [Barrkira Aboriginal Homelands](https://www.laynhapuy.com.au/our-homelands/barrkira/) of northeast Arnhem Land, as part of my [Master of Science (BioScience)](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/study-with-us/graduate-courses/science/master-of-science). This research is conducted by, with and for the [Yolŋu First Nations](https://www.dhimurru.com.au/yolngu-culture.html) people, who are concerned about [recent observed declines](https://indigenousknowledge.unimelb.edu.au/Research/seed-funding/2023-recipients/two-way-knowledge-sharing-for-native-bee-climate-adaptation-in-arnhem-land) in traditional honey (guku) harvests. Having the opportunity to experience the incredibly rich knowledge that my Yolŋu hosts have shared with me has been an important and formative experience in my life. The deep connection to country and genuine care for the landscape that Yolŋu and other First Nations People have is profound and needs to be supported and protected at all costs. Our country has over 2000 of the most incredible native bee species which are amazing, beautiful and in need of our help. Many people don't realise that European honeybees, aside from being important crop pollinators and commercial honey producers, are actually feral in the Australian environment. Bee hotels are more like nurseries, where females can safely lay their eggs. Constructing a bee hotel is a small and easy thing that can have huge benefits for local conservation of native bees, particularly in urban settings where flowers are abundant, but nesting habitat like bare ground and native trees is very limited. So far, I have contributed to building 37 bee hotels and I run a [website](https://nativebeehotels.com/) with tips on making optimal bee hotels. It's such a simple and easy DIY project that can have a big benefit for our biodiversity. My top three tips for building a successful bee hotel are placement, materials and design. Placement: Bees need morning sun, and plenty of food resources like flowers nearby they can pollinate. Materials: Native hardwood like Eucalyptus, or hollow/pithy stemmed materials like bamboo are best for cavity nesting bees like [leaf cutter bees](https://www.aussiebee.com.au/leafcutter_bee.html) or [masked bees](https://www.aussiebee.com.au/masked-bees.html), while sand and clay mixtures are the best materials for building earth blocks which provide habitat for ground nesting bees like [blue banded bees](https://www.aussiebee.com.au/blue-banded-bee-information.html). Be careful if buying a pre-made bee hotel as some overseas materials are chemically treated or have been fumigated at customs, which can be detrimental to native bees. Design: When drilling the holes, you want to use varying sizes between three to 10 millimetres in diameter. The bees will lay an egg in each cell, and you want to make as many cells as possible that fit into the cavity - that's why a deep hollow is so important. Holes larger than 10 millimetres aren't recommended because there's not many native bees that are that large, especially in Melbourne. While I'm away from home, my family take care of our bee hotel. My dad regularly sends me updates, and I love heading home and finding out who has moved in. My dad is also learning a lot about bees now. Once everyone starts to learn about bees, they always seem to want to know more. My favourite bee is the Xylocopa, otherwise known as the [Carpenter bee](https://www.aussiebee.com.au/xylocopa.html). They live for years and years, while some bees only live for a matter of weeks. They also have one of the furthest flying ranges of any bees, and they are much better fliers than other species. They essentially fly until they age and their wings start to degrade. I grew up obsessed with nature documentaries - National Geographic, Steve Irwin, David Attenborough, Malcolm Douglas - I watched it all. I've always loved the outdoors and science subjects. I'm lucky to now be combining my passions and doing what I dreamed of when I was really young. I was recently awarded a position as a [Wattle Fellow](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/wattlefellowship). It's a great program for those who are environmentally minded and focused on sustainability, especially for those who want to be a leader in making positive changes. In future, I hope I can continue doing fieldwork, learning from our Indigenous communities about caring for country and getting to explore and protect the beautiful places around Australia. I just love learning about everything. - As told to Alexa Viani and Ellie Freeman [here](/battle-to-save-aussie-bees-one-bee-hotel-at-time-1175410/).",

    "text": "\"On a très peur\": les habitants de Mayotte se préparaient vendredi au passage de Chido, un cyclone tropical intense qui vaut à l'archipel de l'océan Indien d'être placé en alerte rouge à partir de 22H00 (20H00 à Paris). \"L'heure est grave. Mayotte n'a jamais connu une telle situation\", a déclaré le président du conseil départemental, Ben Issa Ousseni, alors que le cyclone, actuellement à environ 500 km au nord-est de Mayotte, est en \"phase d'intensification\" selon Météo-France. \"J'ai fait le plein de bouteilles d'eau, de nourriture, de bougies...\", témoigne Fatima, habitante de Majicavo-Koropa et mère de trois enfants, qui craint les \"vents violents\" et les \"orages\". \"On a très peur\", confie cette femme de 57 ans, encore marquée par le passage d'un cyclone quand elle était enfant aux Comores, \"les vagues (qui) ravageaient tout, les poteaux électriques par terre\", les \"dégâts partout\". Dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi, Météo-France prévoit à Mayotte \"de violentes rafales de vent, des pluies intenses, des vagues submersives couplées à une surélévation de la mer\", des conditions météorologiques qui entraînent \"un risque de ruissellement et d'inondation, et une houle marine qui peut avoir des effets importants sur le littoral\", a précisé le préfet de Mayotte, François-Xavier Bieuville. \"C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h\", a déclaré le préfet du département lors d'une conférence de presse, qui a enjoint les bateaux à \"impérativement rejoindre la terre ferme\". Dès 22H00, toute circulation sur la voie publique sera interdite sur les deux îles et l'aéroport de Dzaoudzi sera fermé à partir de 20H00 (18H00 heure de Paris). La dernière barge, qui relie la Grande-Terre à la Petite-Terre, partira à 17h30 heure locale. L'Agence régionale de santé demande aux patients de \"ne pas se déplacer mais d'appeler le 15\", et ajoute que \"les moyens médicaux ont été renforcés pour prendre en charge les personnes blessées ou malades\". - 71 centres d'hébergement - Le préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans l'un des 71 centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités. Ces centres, situés dans les établissements scolaires et gymnases, \"seront ouverts à tous\", a-t-il assuré. Sont concernées en priorité les 100.000 personnes logeant dans des \"habitations non solides\" qui ont été identifiées par les autorités. Si elle vit aujourd'hui dans un \"logement sécurisé\", Fatima reste tout de même inquiète: \"On va écouter la radio et faire tout ce qu'il faut\", assure-t-elle. Outre la diffusion d'une alerte SMS par les autorités, pour prévenir la population, \"les policiers municipaux sont allés dans chaque village\", a indiqué le préfet, notamment dans les quartiers difficiles d'accès. \"La priorité c'est de mettre les gens en sécurité\", assure le maire de Chiconi, Madi Ousseni Mohamadi, qui prépare le collège de sa commune - fermé vendredi et samedi comme tous les établissement scolaires de l'archipel - à accueillir la population. \"On a déposé quelques matelas pour que les gens puissent se reposer. On a mis des bouteilles d'eau et quelques denrées alimentaires\", souligne le maire de cette commune qui borde le littoral. Il a aussi déployé des agents sur le terrain pour \"dégager les abords des routes des éléments qui pourraient s'envoler et faire des dégâts\", comme des carcasses de voitures par exemple. Le ministère de l'Intérieur avait annoncé jeudi l'envoi à Mayotte de 110 professionnels de la sécurité civile depuis l'île de La Réunion. L'archipel de Mayotte, relativement épargné par les cyclones, avait déjà été touché par le cyclone Belna en 2019, qui n'avait cependant pas fait de dégât majeur. publié le 13 décembre à 16h25, AFP",

    "text": "Ukraine can stop Putin if US provides weapons - Biden Ukraine could stop the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin if it will be provided with the necessary weapons, states US President Joe Biden in his address to Congress. \"Since President Lincoln and the Civil War, there have been undersolved at home as there are today. Putin's Russia on the March invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you, he will not. But Ukraine, Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide them with the weapons they need to defend itself,\" Biden said. According to the president, aid is being blocked by those who want to step away from global leadership. Biden also mentioned Trump in his speech and his support for Putin. \"Now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin quote - do whatever the hell you want. That's a quote. A former president actually said that bowing down to the Russian leader. I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous and it's unacceptable,\" Biden said. According to the President of the US, the country cannot put Ukraine, Europe, and the entire free world at risk. \"History is literally watching. History is watching. The US walks away if it puts Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk, the Free World will be at risk, and bolding others to do what they wish, to do us harm. My message to President Putin, whom I've known for a long time, is simple - we will not walk away, we will not bow down\" said the President of the US.

    "text": "Five Stars Reviews for Beth Bristow’s Epic Fiction, “Survival of the Blood” [EINPresswire.com](https://www.einpresswire.com/)/ -- History and fiction are two genres that, technically, do not go together. However, with a combination of an epic historical war, a narrative about surviving bloodlines, and a sprinkle of supernatural elements, readers will go crazy over a piece of history documented in literature. In [Beth Bristow](https://www.pageturner.us/bookstore/survival-of-the-blood)’s first book, [Survival of the Blood](https://www.pageturner.us/bookstore/survival-of-the-blood), she is able to do exactly that. Her book, published as one of the best-reviewed titles of PageTurner Press and Media, explores the history of eighteenth century England as the Scotland Highlanders march against the throne—in a bid to dethrone King George II. However, the Highlanders are overpowered by the trained, armed, and ready army of the king, forcing surviving Highlanders to flee or face life in captivity. Survival of the Blood tackles themes of freedom and heritage as it highlights the Highlanders fight to be free of the British rule. It emphasizes the importance of having a surviving male in a Highlander clan to continue the bloodlines. These themes have garnered incredibly high regard for both Bristow and her book. According to an editorial review in Reader’s Favorite, “Author Beth Bristow perfectly captures the gritty, blood realism of British history in this beautifully penned and in-depth literary work. K. C. Finn, the writer of the review, goes on to state that, “The novel is well rounded with deep character commitment and emotionally charged scenes that bring us closer to the figures under pressure as we root for their success.” In conclusion, the review recommends the book to all historical fiction fans and literary fiction fans alike. Similarly, The US Review of Books calls Bristow’s work authentic with its use of the Gaelic dialect and fascinating details of eighteenth-century Scotland. Priscilla Estes, the book reviewer, finishes her review by stating that, “The surprise ending sets up the delightful possibility of a sequel.” Even verified readers from Amazon.com have given the book 5 stars, with one reviewer writing, “Survival of the Blood illustrates the tenacity of a people to survive brutality, starvation, subjugation with fortitude, unbelievable strength, adaptability, and a drive to survive wherever life took them as history has shown.” Beth Bristow discovered she had Cameron Clan ancestors, which prompted her to seek more information about them. She took many trips to Scotland and considers the misty mountains and glens of the Highlands as the most memorable thing she has ever seen. She has also written several articles and short stories about the English and Scottish history. Survival of the Blood is the first book in her duology that chronicles the Highlanders battle with the English monarchy. Its sequel is Tragedy of the Blood.

    "text": "Um novo estudo de pesquisadores coreanos descobriu que telhados “verdes” podem ajudar a não só economizar energia dos edifícios, mas também a diminuir a [temperatura](https://olhardigital.com.br/tag/temperatura/) de uma cidade. O experimento realizado pela equipe mostrou que a presença de cobertura vegetal no topo dos prédios foi responsável por reduzir o consumo de [energia](https://olhardigital.com.br/tag/energia/) com resfriamento e derrubar a temperatura da superfície e do ar em mais de 2 °C.

Segundo uma das responsáveis pelo estudo, a Prof. Santamouris, anteriormente as pesquisas se concentravam no impacto dos telhados nos edifícios em si e não no entorno como um todo. O resultado é que as coberturas vegetais ajudaram a economizar energia do prédio e diminuir a temperatura da cidade ao redor. Veja como o estudo foi feito: - A pesquisa foi conduzida em Seul, capital da Coreia do Sul, durante agosto, o mês mais quente por lá; - De acordo com a Prof. Santamouris, a cidade é uma das que sofre com as alterações climáticas e a rápida urbanização, que tem como consequência problemas de sobreaquecimento e aumento no consumo de energia; - Então, segundo o site [Techxplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-02-green-roofs-cool-cities-energy.html), a equipe fez simulações climáticas de resfriamento e de energia em grande escala em edifícios em três cenários diferentes de cobertura vegetal; - Todos os três eram telhados verdes não irrigados, um tipo com potencial de implementação em larga escala com custos menores de manutenção. Conclusões de energia e temperatura urbana A partir das simulações, eles observaram que, quanto maior a cobertura do telhado verde, mais significativa é a redução na demanda de energia e na temperatura ao redor. Em um caso em que 90% dos edifícios foram cobertos com telhados verdes, a temperatura do ar e da superfície da cidade diminui entre 0,54 °C e 2,17 °C. Já o consumo de energia caiu em 7,7%. Isso porque, segundo os pesquisadores, esse tipo de estrutura resfria a temperatura local, o que ajuda na evaporação através da transpiração das plantações. Isso, por sua vez, diminui a necessidade de sistemas de resfriamento, como ar-condicionados, economizando energia. Já a camada de sol e vegetação dos telhados verde reduz a transferência de calor para os edifícios. Qual o cenário atual Seul ainda não é referência nos telhados verdes, mas espera-se que, com as políticas públicas locais, a cobertura se expanda para entre 30 e 60% na próxima década. Para os pesquisadores, com o incentivo certo, a cobertura pode chegar a 90%. O estudo ainda lembra que os telhados verdes são caros e podem não ser a melhor solução em todos os casos, mas, com o investimento adequado, podem trazer os benefícios certos, inclusive climáticos.",

    "text": "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes Man City manager Pep Guardiola will be more worried about Liverpool than Arsenal.\nWhile he admits the contest will be a close one, he believes the Anfield club are bigger challengers to Manchester City at present than Arsenal.\nOn Stick to Football, by Sky Bet, Scholes stated: “I think Liverpool’s squad is better than Arsenal’s. I think Pep Guardiola will be more worried about Liverpool than Arsenal.\n“Liverpool’s midfield have got legs. When they played against United at Old Trafford (in a 3-0 win), I thought: ‘Wow, they look like a fit team’ and there’s quality with it as well.\nRead Also: Europa League: Dele-Bashiru Bags Assist As Lazio Beat Twente, Go Top\n“The three in the middle of the pitch with the forwards they’ve got in front of them, it doesn’t matter (who they’ve got in midfield) – it’s that saying ‘you’re only as good as your forwards are’. They’ve got five or six forwards who are special. That middle of the pitch doesn’t become as important.\nScholes added: “If you want to win leagues, you have to win these big games. You have to win against your rivals. (Manchester) City was the same last year – (Arsenal) went to City last year and got a draw and celebrated it. That was the time to go and win the league.\n“Without the sending-offs, Arsenal haven’t been great anyway. (The midfield) is not flowing, like it was last year. (Having no Martin) Odegaard could be a big issue (against Liverpool).”",
