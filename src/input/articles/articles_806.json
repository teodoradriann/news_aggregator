La más relevante es la prohibición de la venta y publicidad de alimentos ultraprocesados y con bajo valor nutricional en las escuelas. Además, se implementarán medidas como:\n• Promoción del consumo de agua potable mediante bebederos.\n• Capacitación del personal encargado de las cooperativas escolares.\n• Fomento del consumo de alimentos locales y de temporada.\nEstudios han demostrado el impacto positivo de regular la venta de comida chatarra en entornos escolares. Una investigación publicada en PLOS Medicine estima que eliminar estos productos podría reducir\nla obesidad infantil en hasta 1.5 puntos porcentuales. Asimismo, un análisis de Obesity Reviews proyecta que esta regulación podría generar un ahorro de 416 mil millones de pesos para el país entre 2026 y 2090.\n-En este sentido, San Luis Potosí tiene la oportunidad de convertirse en un referente nacional-.\n“San Luis Potosí también tiene una gran oportunidad para comprometerse con esta estrategia, para cerrarle la puerta de las escuelas a la chatarra y que en su lugar las y los escolares tengan a su alcance alimentos saludables locales y de temporada”, señaló Castillo.\nPor lo tanto en San Luis Potosí, las autoridades educativas han anunciado la implementación del programa Vida Saludable en las escuelas del estado.\nDesde 2022, organizaciones como Salud Crítica han impulsado cambios normativos para garantizar entornos alimentarios saludables en las escuelas. Uno de sus logros más importantes ha sido la implementación del etiquetado frontal de advertencia en productos ultraprocesados, con los octágonos negros que alertan sobre exceso de azúcar, sodio y grasas.\n-Más allá de la salud infantil, esta regulación también representa una oportunidad para fortalecer la economía local y mejorar el rendimiento académico-.\n“Se trata de una oportunidad para mejorar la salud, la economía local y el aprendizaje, y garantizar un futuro mejor a niñas, niños y adolescentes, jóvenes, pero también a familias y comunidades completas”, concluyó Castillo.\nCon este cambio, las escuelas dejarán de ser un espacio donde predomina la comida chatarra para convertirse en un lugar que promueva hábitos saludables, beneficiando a las nuevas generaciones y al país en su conjunto.",

    "title": "BJP slams govt for bringing ‘anti-Hindu’ policies in Karnataka | Bengaluru - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the Congress-led state government of implementing “anti-Hindu” policies following the passing of the “Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Bill 2024” in the state assembly on Thursday.The bill proposes the establishment of a “Common Pool Fund” under the Hindu religious institutions and charitable endowments department, enabling the government to collect taxes from temples based on their revenues, people aware of the matter said. As per the bill, the government will levy a 10% tax on temples with revenues exceeding ₹1 crore, and a 5% tax on those generating revenues between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore.Muzrai minister Ramalinga Reddy said in the Assembly that the fund’s objectives include providing amenities to temples, insurance coverage, a death relief fund for temple priests and scholarships for children from families of approximately 40,000 priests.Within the Muzrai department’s jurisdiction, there exist approximately 35,000 temples, segmented into distinct categories based on their annual incomes. Among these, 205 temples fall into Group A, recording incomes surpassing ₹25 lakh annually, while Group B encompasses 193 temples with earnings ranging between ₹5 lakh and ₹25 lakh. The remaining 34,000 temples, registering incomes below ₹5 lakh per annum, constitute Group C.Historically, Group A temples have directed 10% of their collection box revenues towards a Common Fund, while Group B temples have allocated 5%. Notably, Group C temples have made no contributions to date.Under the proposed amendment, temples generating revenues exceeding ₹1 crore annually will be obligated to contribute 10% to the Common Pool Fund. Temples yielding revenues ranging from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore will be required to allocate 5% to the fund. Temples with incomes below ₹10 lakh will be exempt from contribution requirements altogether.The management of the common funds will be entrusted to the “Rajya Dharmika Parishat”, primarily aimed at providing aid to Category C temples and offering welfare measures to the families of temple staff, said the minister.However, BJP state president BY Vijayendra criticised the move, alleging that the state government is attempting to bolster its finances at the expense of temples. He questioned why only temples were being targeted and not other religious institutions, expressing concerns over the diversion of devotees’ offerings from temple renovation and convenience to other purposes. “The Congress government, which is adopting consistently anti-Hindu policies in the state, has now taken a crooked look at the revenue of Hindu temples and passed the Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments bill to fill its empty coffers,” he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).Vijayendra also questioned the state government as to why only temples are being targeted and no other religious institutions. “Under this, the government will collect 10% of the income from temples earning over ₹1 crore, this is nothing but poverty. The offering dedicated by the devotees for the knowledge of God and the development of the temple should be allocated for the renovation of the temple and for the convenience of the devotees. If it is allocated for another purpose, it is on the divine beliefs of the people. There will be violence and fraud,” he added.In response, minister Ramalinga Reddy refuted the BJP’s accusations, stating that the funds would be utilised for “dharmic parishad” purposes, including the upliftment of economically weaker priests.“The BJP is the biggest anti-Hindu party. It had neglected the temples. Even the BJP did the same during their time, they took 5% from temples with income between ₹5 lakh to ₹25 lakh. For income above ₹25 lakh, they took 10%. The money will be used for dharmic parishad like upliftment of economically weaker priests,” Reddy said.“Vijayendra Yediyurappa, it is clear that BJP always pursues political gains by claiming that Congress is anti-Hindu. However, we, the Congress, consider ourselves the true proponents of Hinduism because, over the years, Congress governments have consistently safeguarded temples and Hindu interests,” he said while taking a dig at the BJP.“Didn’t your BJP government neglect its responsibilities between 2008 and 2013, as well as from 2019 to 2023? It seems they turned a blind eye to the revenues of Hindu religious institutions and charitable endowments, despite the existence of acts or bills in place since 2001,” he added.",

The discovery comes almost 50 years after the foundation first detected the likeness of a mysterious woman behind the deep blue paint.\nMiró, often described as a Surrealist , gifted “Painting” to his friend Joan Prats, who owned the work until his death in 1970. Five years later, Fundació Joan Miró acquired the work. In 1978, the organization conducted the first X-ray of the painting during a preliminary restoration report, which revealed a portrait of an unidentified woman.\nIn the most recent study led by Head of Preventive Conservation and Restoration Elisabet Serrat, foundation researchers used more advanced techniques, including infrared photography and X-ray spectroscopy and fluorescence, to discern who the mysterious woman was.\nGet the latest art news, reviews and opinions from Hyperallergic.\nDaily Weekly Opportunities Sign up Fundació Joan Miró has known about the portrait beneath “Painting” since the 1970s, but has not been able to identify its subject until now.\nAccording to Fundació Joan Miró, the Catalan artist overpainted other works — mostly to criticize what he deemed “imitative painting.” The same year “Painting” was completed, Miró famously declared his intent to “ assassinate painting ” in a challenge to artistic convention. Between 1940 and 1960, Miró overpainted portraits, and by the 1970s, he concealed mostly landscapes.\nIn later iterations of covering existing artworks, Miró often left evidence suggesting the base painting’s existence. In the case of “Painting,” Miró left behind raised clumps of paint over the brooch and earrings of his mother’s portrait.\nResearchers suspect the original portrait was painted by Cristòfol Montserrat Jorba, who also painted a similar portrait of the artist’s mother in 1907. The subsumed woman was identified as Miró’s mother based on the technical similarity between these two works as well as Serrat’s observation that the two faces were “exactly the same,” as she told the Guardian .\nCristòfol Montserrat Jorba’s “Portrait of Dolors Ferrà i Oromí” (1907) led researchers to conclude that the artist painted the portrait underlying Joan Miró’s “Painting” (1927)\nAn analysis of the paint suggests that Miró used zinc white to prepare the second-hand canvas for his new work. Researchers aren’t sure why the artist decided to smother the portrait of his mother for this particular painting, but the foundation suggested it could have been out of convenience.\nBut the organization’s executive director, Marko Daniel, told the Guardian he has a different theory.\n“It is an act of rebellion. But Miró was already 32 when he started this, so it’s not a juvenile act of rebellion against his parents,” Daniel said. Instead, he suspects it was an act “against the kind of world that his parents represented; the middle-class aspirations to being ever so slightly posher than you really are.”\nThe findings are the subject of the institution’s exhibition Under the Layers of Miró: A Scientific Investigation , which will run through June 29.\nA photograph using transmitted infrared light shows details of the portrait subject’s face.

Ce recul de la banquise est observé alors que la planète entame une 3e année d'affilée avec des températures historiquement chaudes : la période de l'hiver 2025 (décembre à février) ressort comme la deuxième plus chaude jamais enregistrée dans le monde, quasiment au même niveau que le record établi en 2024.
