    "text": "The National Weather Service anticipates freezing rain will hit the Omaha area between 5 and 6 p.m. Friday night Drivers should expect roads to start to get slick by 7 or 8 p.m., though timing could depend on how temperatures fluctuate throughout the day, according to Clint Aegerter, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Valley. As precipitation continues, the highest ice accumulations will be possible overnight. Omaha is expected to get between 0.1 to .25 of an inch of ice accumulation, according to the weather service. Some sleet may work its way into the precipitation at points, but snow is unlikely, Aegerter said. As temperatures warm, the precipitation is expected to transition to rain around 3 or 4 a.m. Saturday. The weather service warned that, given cold road temperatures, ice may stick even after air temperatures climb above freezing. People are also reading… Aegerter encouraged anyone planning to be out and about Friday evening to check road conditions before they hit the road and drive cautiously, especially on bridges and on-ramps. \"If you are going out, take it slow,\" he said. \"Roads that look wet could be a sheet of ice, basically.\" Weather-related closures and cancellations Citing the potential for icy road conditions, some organizations have canceled services and events. Offutt Air Force base has authorized an early releases of non mission-essential personnel starting at 2 p.m. The Omaha Public Power District's walk-in customer service center at Energy Plaza will close at 4 p.m. All Boys and Girls Club of the Midlands locations will close at 6 p.m. The Rose Theater has cancelled its 7 p.m. performance of \"A Christmas Story.\" Metro Transit will move 13 of its bus routes to Snow Route Option A starting at 5 p.m. Friday. The same routes will also begin on Snow Route Option A Saturday and are expected to stay on the modified route until at least 9 a.m. The routes affected include routes 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 24, 26, 30, 35, 36, 55 and 120. Riders will get at least a 2-hour notice before any changes are made, according to Metro. More information is available at ometro.com",

    "text": "Premier League: Ipswich 0 Brighton 2 (Mitoma 59, Rutter 81) A first league win in nine for Brighton and the latest hard truth for Ipswich. The home side had been under little serious threat until Kaoru Mitoma, profiting from loose defending, scored just before the hour but were never in the game after that.\nThey were smothered by visitors who chose to do anything but sit back on their lead, Georginio Rutter doubling the lead and ensuring a swift return to the relegation zone for Kieran McKenna’s team.\nBrighton cruised home and, with players newly fit, will hope to have drawn breath for a march up the table.\nThe prematch levels of respect between McKenna and Fabian Hürzeler had been considerable: two of the best young managers around oversee teams to be proud of, and there was another clear point in common.\nREAD MORE Both sides might wonder how their seasons would look if draws more regularly became victories; Brighton had tied six of their winless run while Ipswich, freshly out of the bottom three on goal difference, could point to the recent dropping of two points late on at Fulham.\nLast time out at Portman Road, though, they had torn into Chelsea and claimed the kind of win that can transform a season. The idea must have been for a similarly roaring start here but Brighton, composed and methodical, called the early tune and kept an often raucous venue quiet.\nBrighton's Kaoru Mitoma (centre) celebrates with Pervis Estupinan after scoring the opening goal against Ipswich. Photograph: John Walton/PA Their ample possession hinted at threat more than exuding it, a well-timed tackle by Kalvin Phillips on Yasin Ayari snuffing out their only approximation of an opening in the first 20 minutes.\nPhillips, a surprising goalscorer in the FA Cup win over Bristol Rovers, had retained his place in midfield. It meant a rare relegation to the bench for Sam Morsy, the Ipswich captain, and they struggled to get a grip in the veteran’s absence. Carlos Baleba, imperious as ever, controlled the engine room and the hosts were not helped by a series of cheap concessions from the back.\nAs usual, Ipswich looked threatening when they did land on the front foot. They struck the first serious blow in the 23rd minute when Nathan Broadhead, carrying the ball across Brighton’s half before turning inside, executed a low curler that Bart Verbruggen turned wide with a strong hand. Proceedings had warmed up, Liam Delap ending a strong run with a marginally less taxing effort that Verbruggen could hold.\nIt was as heady as the first half action, its tempo respectful rather than rapid, ever became. By half-time Ipswich were consistently posing the greater danger, Verbruggen saving smartly from the returning Omari Hutchinson’s 20-yarder and two promising Wes Burns breaks going to waste. Delap barrelled into Jan Paul van Hecke twice; the third time he skipped past the Dutchman before Joël Veltman thundered in fairly.\nCould anyone break the impasse that had taken hold under a luminous yellow moon? Amid a bright Ipswich re-emergence Delap nibbled off the ball at Veltman, continuing what had become a running spat, and was booked.\nA VAR check clears Georginio Rutter's goal for Brighton. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Brighton responded by finally contriving a glimmer, Jacob Greaves reacting smartly to block from Simon Adingra.\nJoão Pedro, heckled by Ipswich’s fans for perceivedly milking another knock before half-time, piqued their ire further by going over limply in the box and then summoning rather more force to clatter in late on the goalkeeper Christian Walton.\nNow the night had some edge, Burns almost plunging the knife into Brighton when snatching a shot wide from Jens Cajuste’s long throw.\nSo it was a sickener for Ipswich when Brighton found a breakthrough from their first genuine opportunity. It came when Greaves misjudged a Veltman pass down the right for Ayari, only helping it into his opponent’s path. Ayari centred for Matt O’Riley, who quickly found Mitoma for a shot that went through a possibly unsighted Walton.\nHürzeler went for the kill with three changes, Luke Woolfenden clearing from near the line during a spell of desperate defending. João Pedro, showing his more edifying side, then spun and drew a spectacular save from Walton. The pendulum had swung decisively.\nIpswich barely left their own half in the 20 minutes after conceding; they could not match Brighton’s power off the bench and one of the replacements, Rutter, cleverly turned in a long-signposted second after a left-sided free-kick had been poorly dealt with. Ipswich had long since faded. – Guardian\nSign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis",

    "text": "The lack of an extension for [Dak Prescott](https://www.totalprosports.com/tag/dak-prescott/) is one of the bigger 2024 [NFL](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/) offseason storylines up to this point Dak Prescott is heading into the final season of a four-year, $160 million pact he signed with the [Dallas Cowboys](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys/) in 2021. And with the team’s first preseason game (Aug. 11 vs. the Los Angeles Rams) approaching, the possibility of Prescott playing out the season on his contract year continues to grow. On top of that, superstar wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and annual Defensive Player of the Year candidate and linebacker Micah Parsons need extensions. Lamb is entering the final year of his rookie deal, and Parsons is eligible for an extension after completing three NFL seasons. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Dak Prescott offered some interesting comments that suggest he’s fully prepared for the possibility of leaving the Cowboys next year, per Jett Beachum of CBS News Texas: “Obviously, I want to be here…but at the end of the day, it’s a business… I’m gonna say it:I want to be here, but when you look up — all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams…That’s not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.” Also Read: [VIDEO: Everyone Is Destroying Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones For His Strange Explanation Of What “All-In” Means](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/video-everyone-is-destroying-dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-for-his-strange-explanation-of-what-all-in-means/) Click on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google! [Follow Us](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLHdqwswrujDAw) Cowboys fans who want Dak Prescott here long-term don’t want to hear it, but he’s telling the cold hard truth. Most of the all-time great quarterbacks ( [Tom Brady](https://www.totalprosports.com/tag/tom-brady/), Peyton Manning, Joe Montana, Steve Young, Brett Favre, Kurt Warner, Joe Namath, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, and so on) played for multiple NFL team. Per [ OvertheCap.com,](https://overthecap.com/player/dak-prescott/4848#:~:text=Prescott%20has%20a%20no%20trade,of%20salary%20into%20a%20bonus.) Prescott also has no-trade and no-tag clauses in his contract. So if he decides on his own to leave Dallas in 2025, there’s nothing Jerry Jones and company can do about it. Last season, Prescott threw for 4,516 yards and 36 touchdowns against only nine interceptions. He finished second in MVP voting behind only Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens. Dallas Cowboys Open Season At Cleveland Browns The Cowboys will try to kick off the 2024 season on a high note when they visit Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns on Sept. 5. Not only does this mark a compelling showdown between two 2023 playoff teams, but it’ll serve as Tom Brady’s debut as an analyst for the “NFL on FOX.” Also Read: [PHOTO: NFL Fans Are Loving The Dallas Cowboys’ New Uniforms Design](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/photo-nfl-fans-are-loving-the-dallas-cowboys-new-uniforms-design/)",
