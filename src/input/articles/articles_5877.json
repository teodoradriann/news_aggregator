Known for its challenging hills and enthusiastic crowds, the Verona loop is a fan-favorite and a true test of endurance.\nLast year, IRONMAN Wisconsin was voted the #1 IRONMAN in North America for athlete experience, thanks in large part to the incredible fan support in Verona.\nThis year, IRONMAN Wisconsin hopes to see even more excitement at the annual Loop Festival on the grounds of St. Christopher’s Church, 301 N. Main St. Highlights include a brand new Fan Zone across Main Street – outside of New Century/Verona Area International School – along with a variety of food, drinks and activities:\nCoffee & Donut stand by the Knights of Columbus\nBrat & Steak Stand by the Knights of Columbus\nCustard, Sundaes & Drinks by the Verona Area High School Cross Country Club\nBaked Goods by the Verona Area High School Dance Team\nPopcorn, Beverages and Treats by the Verona Area High School Theatre Department\nPunt-Pass-Kick, Free-Throw and Soccer Contests by the Knights of Columbus\nFan Zone at New Century Charter School with an Obstacle Course, Sign-Making, Bike Loop Bingo and Scavenger Hunt.

    "text": "Dans un mois se tiendront les élections de la chambre d'agriculture départementale des Hautes-Alpes et régionale de Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. Une occasion pour la Coordination Rurale des Hautes-Alpes de tenter d'améliorer la situation dans les fermes de la région. À l'approche des élections des chambres d'agriculture , prévues le 31 janvier 2025, la Coordination Rurale des Hautes-Alpes a présenté ce jeudi 26 décembre, à Montmaur, sa liste et ses ambitions. Menée par Serge Jousselme, président du syndicat, cette équipe de vingt éleveurs et agriculteurs souhaite porter des projets concrets pour répondre aux défis actuels de l'agriculture.\n\"Si nous arrivons à la tête de la Chambre d'Agriculture, nous aimerions l'ouvrir à l'ensemble des listes, car nous n'avons pas l'exclusivité des idées\" déclare à BFM DICI Serge Jousselme à la Ferme du Lauzon, où les membres de la liste se sont réunis.\n\"Il est nécessaire de rassembler toutes nos idées pour avancer ensemble\", poursuit-il.\nDes priorités déjà tracées Parmi leurs principales revendications, la Coordination Rurale des Hautes-Alpes met en avant la nécessité de garantir un revenu décent aux agriculteurs. \"Le plus important, c'est de leur redonner une dignité financière,\" insiste Serge Jousselme.\nCela passe notamment par une revalorisation des retraites, avec un minimum de 100% du SMIC, et la suppression d'un article de loi qui pénalise les retraités ayant cotisé à plusieurs régimes.\nIls souhaitent également favoriser la valorisation locale des produits agricoles. \"Des prix, pas des primes!\", clame le syndicat, appelant à des tarifs justes pour assurer un revenu durable aux exploitants.\nLa simplification des démarches administratives figure aussi parmi les priorités. \"Nous voulons travailler dans nos champs, pas dans des bureaux!\", s'indigne le président. Pour la Coordination Rurale, des mesures concrètes doivent être mises en place, notamment pour faciliter l'entretien des cours d'eau et gérer les réserves collinaires pour l'irrigation.\nUne agriculture face aux défis de la prédation La protection des élevages reste un enjeu majeur dans les Hautes-Alpes. Face à la menace persistante des loups , la Coordination Rurale 05 milite pour un renforcement des dispositifs de protection et une révision des mesures existantes, jugées inefficaces. Plusieurs actions que le syndicat espère pouvoir défendre en présentant sa participation à l'élection.\nQuant à la liste, elle est composée de 20 candidats issus de divers secteurs agricoles qui incarnent la diversité du département. Aux côtés de Serge Jousselme figurent, entre autres, Marine Gohier, éleveuse bio à Montmaur, Mélanie Costanzo, arboricultrice et présidente d'Alpes Coop Fruit et Bruno André, président de l'abattoir de Gap.\nTous partagent un même objectif: replacer \"le bon sens paysan\" au cœur des décisions, tout en préparant une agriculture innovante et respectueuse de l'environnement. Un retour aux valeurs fondamentales et à un combat renouvelé pour préserver l'exception agricole française.\nSur le même sujet Alpes-de-Haute-Provence: les candidats aux élections de la Chambre d'agriculture se dévoilent Alpes-de-Haute-Provence: Laurent Depieds, candidat aux élections de la Chambre d'agriculture Avec dix réunions publiques prévues dès le 3 janvier dans tout le département, le syndicat espère mobiliser largement pour faire entendre sa vision d'une agriculture durable, équitable et respectueuse des agriculteurs.\nJorick Margrit Les plus lus\n\"Nettoyer les prisons\", narcotrafic, consentement...

(KCTV) - A Sedalia man has been charged with kidnapping after he allegedly forced a medical professional to help him gain access to prescription drugs he intended to sell.\nPettis County, Missouri, Circuit Court records filed on Tuesday, Dec. 17, have revealed that Phoenix M. Painter Torres, 26, of Sedalia, now faces charges including kidnapping after a disturbance at a medical office.\nA probable cause statement filed by the Pettis County Sheriff’s Office indicated that around 6:15 p.m. on Monday, law enforcement officials were called to the Pettis County Courthouse and Annex with reports of a disturbance.

    "title": "The aviation industry is failing its climate goals 'dramatically,' experts say",
    "text": "Current and former aviation professionals have rallied together to call for a fundamental transition of the industry.\nAccording to a report in the Guardian , the newly formed Call Aviation to Action believes the industry is overly optimistic about emissions-cutting technology and stuck in a business model that requires ever-increasing flight numbers.\nCarbon dioxide emissions from aviation are not part of any national country plan. Instead, they are governed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN body that is “failing dramatically” at tackling greenhouse gas emissions in the industry according to Karel Bockstael, a co-founder of the group, and a vice-president of sustainability at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines until 2022.\nCriticised by experts as “ unambitious and problematic ”, the ICAO’s Corsia scheme took eight years to create and amounts to nothing more than voluntary carbon offsets, doing nothing to actually curb emissions at the source. “If we do not act, by 2050 aviation emissions will be about a quarter of all human-caused emissions,” Bockstael warned. “We hope our initiative will help a really big group of aviation professionals to speak up, because we think they’re the silent majority.”\nLaunched on Tuesday, Call Aviation to Action has amassed nearly 200 members eager to chart a new, sustainable course for the future. The group has four goals for this year, the first centering on setting absolute emission reduction targets in line with carbon budgets as “delayed action makes the problem harder to tackle.”\n[ See more: Macao pledges support for sustainable development MIECF ]\nThe second is a new approach to lobbying, actively advocating for and implementing regulation to keep the industry on track, ensure a level playing field, and drive innovation. Striving for perfect policies, they say, should not delay the implementation of already good ones.\nThirdly, the group wants a realistic approach to the availability of new technologies, in terms of time, scale, cost and business planning. Lastly, it calls on the industry to acknowledge that managing global demand fairly is part of the solution.\nConstraints on demand such as flight or carbon taxes, Bockstael noted, should offer equitable access to flying in developing countries and address heavy frequent flyers in rich countries – just one percent of the world’s population is responsible for half of aviation emissions . Instead of the industry adding more and more routes, the group also advocates for intelligent demand management, focused on maintaining the societally most valuable connections so that air travel remains available to the largest group of people and those who rely on it the most.\nFor those who have already joined the group, this simple but revolutionary outlook is energising after so many years of delay.\n“I can’t wait to see the aviation industry leadership finally getting real about the climate crisis and mobilising the imagination and courage from which flying was born in the first place,” said Jan Ernst de Groot, former managing director and executive board member of KLM.\n “The climate can has been kicked down the road for too long,” he told the Guardian .",

    "title": "F2 España: Martins gana y Correa logra su primer podio desde el accidente de 2019",
    "text": "Victor Martins ofreció una clase magistral para encarrilar su campaña en la F2 con la victoria en la carrera Sprint española. El piloto de ART había tenido problemas en las primeras rondas de la nueva temporada, pero demostró toda su habilidad al convertir una segunda posición de salida en el liderato en la curva 1 y ya no miró atrás. Martins adelantó a Ritomo Miyata, aunque el piloto de Rodin fue relegado a la octava posición tras recibir dos penalizaciones de cinco segundos por exceder los límites de la pista. Roman Stanek (Trident) y Zane Maloney (Rodin) fueron sancionados, mientras que Franco Colapinto, Dennis Hauger (MP Motorsport) y Maloney, una vez más, fueron objeto de investigaciones posteriores a la carrera. Tras una mala salida desde la pole, Kush Maini (Invicta) cayó hasta la quinta posición en los primeros compases, pero no tardó en remontar hasta situarse a rebufo de Miyata. No solo fue el primer viaje de Martins al podio esta temporada, sino que también fue la primera pieza de plata para Juan Manuel Correa (DAMS) desde el horrible accidente en Bélgica en 2019 en el que sufrió múltiples lesiones. Juan Manuel Correa, Dams Foto: Simon Galloway \\/ Motorsport Images Hizo un movimiento en la penúltima vuelta sobre Gabriel Bortoleto (Invicta), cuyos neumáticos habían caído al precipicio. Fue otro día para olvidar también para Prema, ya que tanto Andrea Kimi Antonelli como Oliver Bearman tuvieron problemas, con el primero terminando P10 y el segundo cayendo como una piedra a la parte trasera del pelotón antes de entrar en boxes. Volvió a la pista y terminó en P21, a 41s de la cabeza. En realidad, la acción fue limitada, con los coches formando rápidamente trenes de DRS y viéndose obligados a gestionar los neumáticos debido a los altísimos niveles de degradación habituales en el Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Paul Aron (Hitech) mantuvo su liderato del campeonato con un cuarto puesto, mientras que su principal rival, Isack Hadjar (Campos) sólo pudo ser séptimo. La caída de Maloney en la clasificación de pilotos continuó, ya que el otrora líder del campeonato llegó a casa en la P19.
