    "text": "Large parts of the country will face disruption from heavy snow and freezing rain over the weekend after forecasters issued two amber weather warnings.\nStranded vehicles on the roads, delayed or cancelled rail and air travel and power cuts are all likely as the UK grapples with a week-long spell of wintry conditions, the Met Office said.\nThere is also a “good chance” that rural communities could be cut off due to the conditions, with up to 30cm of snowfall expected locally.\nIt comes after initial data indicated that Rostherne in Cheshire and Yeovilton in Somerset saw temperatures drop to minus 5C overnight, just shy of previous estimates which suggested the mercury could dip as low as minus 8C.\nIn Scotland, Eskdalemuir in Dumfries and Galloway felt the same chilly temperatures, hitting minus 5C at 11pm on Thursday.\nThe coldest temperature recorded in January last year was minus 14C, in Dalwhinnie in the Scottish Highlands.\nAn amber warning for snow and freezing rain covering most of Wales and central England, including the Midlands and the north-west cities of Liverpool and Manchester, is in place from 6pm on Saturday to midday on Sunday, the Met Office said.\nThe second warning for snow, covering most of northern England including Leeds, Sheffield and the Lake District, has been issued from 9pm on Saturday to midnight on Sunday.\nBoth of the warning areas can expect to see 3cm to 7cm of snowfall widely, while snow may mix with rain at times in lower-lying areas, the forecaster said.\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts were issued on Thursday and will run until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said.\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting said on Friday it was “a weekend to layer up and put the heating on” due to the cold conditions.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: “We are heading into a cold snap this weekend and I know there are lots of concerns, not just amongst charity leaders, but also among NHS and social care leaders as well, about the particular risks and vulnerabilities this weekend as temperatures drop, both in terms of risk of accident and injury, but also risk from the cold itself.\n“This is a weekend to wrap up and keep warm, to take sensible precautions about going out and about.”\nCouncils across London and southern England have activated emergency measures including additional accommodation to help rough sleepers stay safe during the cold snap.\nJames Lally, services director of homelessness charity St Mungo’s, said: “Access to a safe and warm place to live is vital for those experiencing homelessness all year round – and during freezing cold weather, emergency accommodation saves lives.\n“St Mungo’s frontline teams are prepared to respond to this critical situation, and continue to work tirelessly around the clock to make sure that as many people as possible can be brought out of the cold and into safety.”\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",

    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tennessee — A new program, [BSN Scholars](https://www.utmedicalcenter.org/blog-post/bsn-scholars-program-announced), offers a new path for University of Tennessee Nursing students to graduate faster, and with less student debt. In exchange for the UT Medical Center paying tuition so future nurses can attend nursing school, students will work at the hospital for three years. \"This is an amazing opportunity, we are being involved in a program where we're able to practice in these amazing facilities that mirror the University of Tennessee Medical Center,\" said Lauren Denney, a BSN Scholar student. \"And with that, we are improving patient care as a whole.\" This program provides an impressive incentive — job security and a scholarship — but also incentivizes students who come to UT to stay in Knoxville. \"I think Knoxville as a whole is beginning to draw more and more people. It's beautiful. The weather's nice, what's not to love?\" said Savannah Blanchard, another BSN Scholar. \"So then, you add in a great medical center on top of all of that, with great staff, and great providers, and great patient community — then what more could you ask for?\" In addition to keeping more qualified nurses in Knoxville after they get their degree at UT, it also increases the number of nursing student spots in the College of Nursing. \"It takes a lot of resources, and a lot of time and energy and commitment to train one registered nurse,\" said Victoria Niederhauser, the Dean of the College of Nursing. \"For us to bring in another 100 into our fold has been a heavy lift and a lot of effort. But by partnering together with UTMC, it certainly lightens that load.\" A nationwide nursing shortage affects hospitals here in East Tennessee, and the UT Medical Center is no different. \"It's also important that we are producing very high-quality nurses who are well prepared to meet the demands that patients,\" said Sandy Leake, the Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer at UTMC. \"We have patients who are sicker, they require more care.\" Prospective students wishing to learn more about the BSN Scholars program can visit their website [here](https://nursing.utk.edu/bsn-scholars-interest-form/).",

    "title": "The Cross is the Axis on which the Cosmos turns – Catholic World Report",
    "text": "But as for me, God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ… — Apostle Paul (Gal 6:14) When St. Paul preached “Jesus Christ and him crucified,” the crucifix did not yet exist as a Christian symbol. Displaying such an object to potential coverts would have outraged Jews and repelled pagans. Verbal witness was one thing, but an actual image of a body nailed to a cross was offensive either as a forbidden idol or as tasteless reminder of public execution. Few images of the Crucifixion in the early Church Although the Sign of the Cross as a devotional gesture was already used by the second century, the earliest picture of a crucifix is a vicious anti-Christian graffito, circa 200. Depicting a crucified man with the head of an ass, it bears the inscription: “Alexamenos adores his god.” The cartoonist was hurling two insults at once, connecting Christianity with an ignoble beast and the cruelest punishment of the day. Romans attached victims to stakes or crosses of varying design with varying techniques in pursuit of inflicting maximum pain. The Gospels simply tell us that Jesus was crucified with nails on a tall wooden structure with space for a plaque above his head. Further details are speculative but the actual procedure differed from what is shown in the classic Stations of the Cross. The condemned one suffered nude except when the Romans allowed some covering for modesty as a concession to Jewish sensibilities. He carried only the horizontal crosspiece (patibulum) to the death-site. There he would be nailed to it through the wrist, not the palm, then lifted onto a preset upright (stauros) before having his feet nailed to that. Bones of three crucifixion victims found in recent times indicate nailing through their heels or ankles. The [Alexamenos graffito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexamenos_graffito#/media/File:Alexorig.jpg) and the earliest Christian art show a platform supporting the feet in a standing position but whether Jesus had one is uncertain. Given Roman distaste for representing or even describing crucifixion and its banning by the Emperor Constantine in 337 AD, by the time Christians began depicting the Savior’s death in the following century, no one living had witnessed a penal crucifixion. The earliest surviving artworks are memorials, not exact images of Christ crucified. Although several gem stones engraved with naked stick figures of Jesus exist that may be as early as the second or third century, these were the private property of wealthy persons. The earliest surviving crucifixion scene for public display is a crude wooden carving on the door of the Church of Santa Sabina in Rome, 420. There Christ and the two thieves merely stand with outstretched arms against a framework that suggests crosses. A [handsome ivory plaque](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/crucifixion.html) made around the same time offers a fully rendered view. Here Jesus nailed on his cross, mourned by Mary and St, John, is flanked by two contrasting figures: marveling Longinus the centurion and despairing Judas hanging dead from a tree. This plaque, part of a Passion cycle made for a small box, establishes a distinctive element of crucifixion iconography for centuries to come: the voluntary nature of Christ’s death. Fully in command of his sacrifice, he is alive, erect, open-eyed, and serene, even if shedding blood. Fastened by four nails, his otherwise unmarred body wears no crown of thorns. There is no sense of hideous agony, because first millennium crucifixes were designed for the meditative mind, not the emotions. But these two works long remained outliers. The Crucifixion had not appeared in the catacombs nor did it suddenly become popular after Constantine’s conversion. Christian artists steadfastly refused to depict Jesus on his cross, perhaps to stay clear of the Christological controversies that roiled the patristic Church. (With similar discretion, they also avoided showing the moment of the Resurrection.) Although they gave Jesus in glory a cross-headed staff and a cruciform halo whose bars stood for the Greek word zoe, meaning “life,” they avoided nailing him to a cross. The Chi-Rho emblem, enclosed within a victory wreath, sometimes hung with the letters Alpha and Omega, and attached to a simple cross stands in for Christ crucified on fourth-century sarcophagus carvings. Fifth-century pilgrims brought portions of holy oil back from Jerusalem in metal ampules embossed with crucifixion scenes where the face of Jesus floats above a bare cross while the two thieves writhe on theirs. Golden crosses set amid starry skies glow on the mosaic walls and ceilings of Late Antique churches, such as Ravenna’s Sant’ Apollinare in Classe (549). The crux gemmata remained a popular motif into the next millennium. The apse mosaic of Santa Pudenziana in Rome (ca. 400) is an early example. Magnificent bejeweled golden crosses for altar display or processional use might carry a disk showing Christ’s face or the Paschal Lamb, but no Corpus. The rise of direct representation of Christ’s death But across these centuries, the old Roman order was collapsing. The Empire split into Eastern and Western halves in 395. The East endured and became Byzantine. But the West fell in 476 and crumbled into separate barbarian kingdoms. Slowly, these transformed the old classical heritage to create new Christian cultures. iconography evolved in both regions through processes now largely obscured by the ravages of time and Iconoclasm A precious survival from the era of transition is the Rabbula Gospels from Syria (586), the earliest known Bible text with large illustrations. Its Crucifixion page brings together motifs that will reappear again and again into the next millennium. Finally, emblems have given way to direct representation. This change from earlier practice rebuts contemporary heresies that denied the actuality of the Passion (Docetism) and the full humanity of the Savior (Monophysitism). Here Jesus is alive and nailed to his cross: his real human body is undergoing a real death. Instead of the shockingly skimpy undergarment worn on the earliest crucifixes, he wears a long, sleeveless gown (colobium). To the left stands Longinus, who is piercing his heart with a spear, balanced on the right by Stephaton, who is offering a wine-soaked sponge on a stalk. The Good Thief and Bad Thief—tied rather than nailed to their crosses—bracket them. Mary and St. John stand further left, three morning women further right. At the base of the cross, three soldiers are dicing for Christ’s garments while a dot and a crescent stand for the Sun and Moon in the sky above. A second band of pictures below the Golgotha scene shows the women at the empty tomb, sleeping guards, and the Magdalen’s encounter with Jesus. The artist has combined both stages of our Redemption—Good Friday and Easter—into a single composition. What happened sequentially becomes simultaneous; before and after has become now. By the middle of the eighth century, this strategy allowed all of Salvation History be condensed onto ivory plaques smaller—usually much smaller—than a sheet of typing paper. Set within frames of gold, jewels, and enamelwork, these miniature relief carvings once adorned the covers of luxurious Bibles and other sacred books for the courts and cloisters of western Europe. Crucifixion scenes were favorite subjects for ivories made during the Carolingian (8th-9th centuries) and Ottonian (10th-11th centuries) eras at such centers as Metz, Liège, Echternach, Cologne, Essen, and Milan. They were visual theology for elite eyes only. A composite overview of motifs featured on these plaques reveals their complexity better than analyses of individual works. Of course, Jesus nailed to the cross always commands the center of the composition. He wears a loincloth or occasionally, a loose, long-sleeved robe. He is typically still alive and untroubled by his ordeal, maintaining the same serenity shown on the earliest Roman ivory carving of the crucifixion. He may relax his upright posture, twisting towards his faithful mourners and even smiling down on them. Blood rarely flows from his hands and feet and then only in stylized rivulets. The symmetrical pair Longinus and Stephaton stand closest to the cross, the former tapping blood and water, the latter administering dilute wine. Next to them come the allegorical figures Ecclesia (Church) and Synagoga (Synagogue), each carrying a banner. Ecclesia holds up a chalice to catch Christ’s flowing blood while wistful Synagoga stands half turned away, half gazing back. A duplicate of Ecclesia may appear at the right hand margin confronting allegorical Jerusalem, an enthroned woman wearing a mural crown. The Two Thieves seldom appear and their postures differ from Christ’s. Mary, St. John, and perhaps some faithful women stand mourning near the cross. Meanwhile, in an upper register, the Father’s mighty hand bestows a crown or victory wreath on his Son borne down by angels. Personifications of the Sun (Sol) and Moon (Luna) hover close to the cross weeping. In a few cases, the upper level also depicts the Ascension, Pentecost, or Christ in majesty. The dead rise from graves, mausoleums, or the depths of the sea wherever they can fit in the composition—beside, below or even above Golgotha. Likewise, the Four Evangelists occupy various spots, sitting in corners or arrayed along borders. They may appear in human, symbolic, or hybrid animal-headed form to record everything, sometimes taking dictation from their own emblems. In a few examples, the lower section depicts gospel episodes including the Nativity or the events of Holy Week. But in most cases, this area deploys symbols wondrous and strange that are the most original features of these carvings. Far down below the disgorging graves lie the half-naked allegorical figures Oceanus (Sea) and Tellus (Earth). He rides a sea monster, grasps an oar, or even sprouts crab pincers on his head. She holds foliage, fondles infants, and nurses snakes at her ample breasts. Between them may sit an enthroned woman who stands for Rome or perhaps in one instance for Cosmos (World). All gaze attentively at the redemptive drama playing out above. At ground level, the stem of one cross impales the belly of a bearded nude male representing Hades. Another one is upheld by a seated female labeled Terra (Earth). A chalice may stand at the base of the cross to collect the Sacred Blood when Ecclesia is absent. A huge serpent representing Satan slithers by the cross or coils around its base. Sometimes, the Evil One takes the form of a dragon clinging to the foot of the cross. He attempts to bar Adam’s—or Adam and Eve’s—resurrection from the grave below. In one stunning example, Adam stands in his grave nearly enfleshed. With hope, he stretches his right hand towards the cross. These lovely ivory plaques teem with meanings as well as figures. No element is there by chance, for each carries meanings and allusions steeped in Patristic thought. For instance, the serpent/dragon by the cross recalls the Tempter’s pose in Eden. There he provoked the Fall. Here he seeks to prevent Redemption by denying Adam access to Savior’s dripping blood that will raise his dust to everlasting life. Adam’s grave is there to receive that grace because, according to legend, he had been interred on the future site of Golgotha, “the Place of the Skull” (calvariae locus in Latin, hence Calvary). His buried skull will continue to appear at the crucifixion for centuries to come and is still seen on Byzantine crucifixes. The artistry displayed here relies on synthesis and symmetry to create grand tableaux of Salvation. Gospel characters and invented figures meet. Symbols converse with the men they symbolize. Humans, angels, and allegories mingle. The living and the dead, the dying and the reviving keep company. Personifications borrowed from pagan Antiquity are baptized to be Christian witnesses. From the heavens above to the underworld below, all creation centers on Our Lord and the Father’s mighty Hand governs all. The Cross is the Axis on which the Cosmos turns But as with all human endeavors, iconography does not stand still. Artistic eras overlap. While these crucifixion plaques were being carved to decorate book covers, actual crucifixes—cross shapes with an attached Corpus–were also starting to be made as devotional objects and personal ornaments. By 850, Byzantine artists had overcome their reluctance to depict Jesus dead. They settled on a stylized figure clad in a loincloth and slumped in a graceful S-curve against his cross. That remains the basic visual formula for the East to this day. By the late tenth century, the West welcomed the pectoral Cross of St. Servais, the Abbess Mathilda of Essen’s processional crosses, and the Cross of Lothair (Aachen). These works glow with gold and gems to suggest the splendors of heaven. Although donors’ taste favored costly materials, the masterpiece of the age is the Gero Crucifix (Cologne, 970). Displaying Jesus at rest in the sleep of death, this life-sized, representational sculpture of polychromed wood exhibits a new aesthetic that foreshadows Romanesque art. Over the course of Christianity’s first thousand years, the crucifixion of Jesus went from a subject that could be preached but not shown, to the inspiration for marvelous public artworks. Whether at the core of a scene or as a solo object, the crucified Savior gazed—and still gazes–back at the world in love. Because Christ Our Lord reigns from his Tree, the Cross is the Axis on which the Cosmos turns.

    "text": "¡Alarmas encendidas! Tras la sorpresiva salida de Salomón Rondón, ahora en River Plate crece la preocupación por diferentes ‘coqueteos’ desde territorio árabe por [Miguel Ángel Borja](https://gol.caracoltv.com/noticias-futbol/miguel-angel-borja) Y es que, a pesar de que el ‘colibrí’ no ha sido uno de los futbolistas protagonistas desde que Martín Demichelis, la idea es que para el próximo año el ‘cafetero’ sí pueda convertirse en el referente de ataque para los argentinos. No obstante, los sondeos desde territorio árabe han generado preocupación en River Plate. “El mercado de pases de [River](https://gol.caracoltv.com/noticias-futbol/river-plate) Y, a pesar de que los nombres de los equipos interesados no tuvieron gran trascendencia, sí es importante destacar que desde territorio argentino no hay intención de que el ‘colibrí’ se vaya del equipo.

Es que para 2024 piensan al colombiano junto al juvenil Agustín Ruberto, flamante goleador del Mundial sub-17, como los dos centrodelanteros natos del equipo”, afirmó ‘TyC Sports’ a través de su página web. Publicidad Sumado a eso, el medio local no ve tan factible las negociaciones, teniendo en cuenta que “el cuadro ‘millonario’ no se desprenderá fácil del colombiano porque cuando llegó desde [Junior,](https://gol.caracoltv.com/noticias-futbol/junior-de-barranquilla) [Siga nuestro canal para tener las noticias de nuestras figuras, del fútbol colombiano e internacional.](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va03mw72v1IyF4rn2J1F)",
