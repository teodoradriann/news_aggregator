    "text": "The international arrest of a fugitive Ojai murder suspect came with an even bigger surprise; he’s the suspect in a separate Ventura homicide from two years earlier.\nOn the morning of May 31, 2025, neighbors discovered Carolyn Nino De Rivera, 26, dead at her home on Sisar Road in the Upper Ojai Valley, an unincorporated area in the mountains northwest of Santa Paula. Suspicion quickly focused on Christian Alexandre Hillairet, a local handyman, investigators said.\nA search was launched but wasn’t concluded until after authorities determined Hillairet, 25, had absconded to Rosarito, Mexico, where he was arrested. Ventura County detectives and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent met Mexican authorities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry on June 4, where Hillairet was transferred to the U.S. Marshals Service and subsequently to Ventura County authorities.\nAfter his return to Ventura County, the Ventura County District Attorney’s office announced that Hillairet was charged with not one but two separate murders.\nIn addition to De Rivera, he is also charged with the November 2023 slaying of Ventura resident William Thompson, who was allegedly bludgeoned to death by some kind of weapon.\n“The defendant’s alleged actions reflect a chilling pattern of violence and cruelty,” District Attorney Erik Nasarenko said in a news release. “Our office is committed to securing justice for these victims and prosecuting Hillairet to the fullest extent of the law.”\nHillairet is facing two counts of murder and numerous special allegations, including multiple murder, that make him eligible for the death penalty. It is also alleged he has committed serious prior violent felonies.\nDuring his first court appearance on June 6, the Ventura County Public Defender’s Office was appointed to represent Hillairet and Judge Kristi Peariso ordered that he remain in custody on a no-bail hold, according to court records. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges and is due back in court on July 8.",

    "title": "Lismore Lantern Parade selected for global study into role of festivals in towns recovering from disasters - ABC News",
    "text": "In short: Researchers from Canada are trying to understand how a festival can help or hinder a community and its recovery after a disaster. The team is studying Lismore in NSW and three other locations around the world that have experienced catastrophic events. What's next? The team will travel to the last destination and wrap up the three-year study. How soon is too soon to dip your toes back into fun after a traumatic experience?\nA new global study, entitled Revelry and Resilience, is attempting to answer that question by examining the role of festivals in communities that have experienced disasters.\n\"We're trying to understand the ways that festivals can contribute to community recovery, or in some cases don't contribute to community recovery,\" lead researcher Christine van Winkle explained.\nFor three decades the Lismore Lantern Parade has been a light in the lives of people in the north-east of NSW. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\nDr van Winkle, an associate professor in kinesiology and recreation management at Canada's University of Manitoba, and her team are in Australia to research the effects of Lismore's Lantern Parade, which celebrated its 30th year on Saturday.\nThe researchers selected Lismore as one of four locations around the world to study, because it has an annual festival and the community was devastated by the catastrophic floods in northern New South Wales in 2022, while still reeling from the effects of the COVID pandemic.\nThe other locations being studied are in Cyprus, the Caribbean and Canada.\nDr Christine van Winkle is leading the Revelry and Resilience global study. ( Supplied: Kiri Shafto, University of Manitoba )\n\"The timing really matters when events take place,\" Dr van Winkle said.\n\"Sometimes it can be a bit too soon and that can present challenges for a community which isn't quite ready to come together.\n\"However, in other communities, they will say it's never too soon to come back together and have a healing experience.\n\"So I think there is a lot of subtlety around what's appropriate in the unique community where the event takes place.\"\nLismore's Lantern Parade falls into that category.\n'Part of Lismore's culture' The Lismore parade's artistic director, Jilly Jackson, says the festival has never skipped a beat, despite COVID and the devastating flood of 2022.\n\"The Lantern Parade makes people feel that things will be alright,\" said Ms Jackson.\nMark Burton says the parade has helped him to feel that life is \"normal\" again. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\nThat perspective was echoed by Lismore resident Mark Burton, who was interviewed on the night of the parade by the research team.\n\"We've all been completely and profoundly affected by that [flood] event. It's very helpful and normalising to be back at an event like [the Lantern Parade],\" Mr Burton said.\nRebuilding the arts after floods After floods devastated the Northern Rivers, the arts sector is looking ahead at how to adapt and rebuild.\nRead more\n\"My children have all been through it and now my grandchildren have their turn. It's a pretty valuable part of Lismore's culture.\"\nCanadian PhD researcher Kiri Shafto said she was struck by how readily people were willing to talk on the evening of the festival.\n\"This might be Australia in general, but people are incredibly open,\" she said.\n\"It seems to be a lynch pin, coming through COVID and then the flood and then to see the Lantern Parade be able to go ahead, it almost was a relief to people,\" Ms Shafto said.\nKiri Shafto is researching the role of festivals in the recovery process for communities struck by disaster. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\n'Hugely psychologically important' For Lismore business owner Deborah Ray, the parade has been essential to her recovery and she even timed the re-opening of her flood-ravaged store, Music Bizarre, with the 2022 parade.\n\"The whole town was so destroyed and so ugly and broken, (and) to have people coming in and be excited to watch the lanterns, it's hugely important,\" she said.\nAs a business owner, Ms Ray said she saw direct benefit from the Lismore festival.\n\"It was hugely psychologically important for the uplifting of spirits and bringing in some money,\" she said.\nDeborah Ray from Lismore's Music Bizarre timed the re-opening of her flood hit business to coincide with the Lismore Lantern Parade. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\n\"It's life blood being pumped back into the city.\"\nMr Burton said the good vibes of the lantern event helped him feel to feel \"normal\".\n\"It's value is hard to measure really,\" he said.\n\"For a lot of us getting back to normal was important and certainly the Lantern Parade is an institution that supports our culture here.\"\nParade lights up community connections As the researchers try to quantify the intangible they made a few observations about recovery in the Lismore community.\nResearcher Kiri Shaft says people she spoke to in Lismore during the parade were \"very open\". ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\n\"Something that Kiri and I noticed was how connected this community is,\" Dr van Winkle said.\n\"It really seemed at the event that there was a lot of re-connecting that was happening.\n\"People who have maybe been displaced or chosen to leave, seemed to have come back to the Lantern Parade to re-connect.\n\"That was the most powerful sense we had [at the event],\" Dr van Winkle said.\n\"If you can [offer that] to a community which is still very much in recovery mode, then you are doing something right,\" Ms Shafto said.\nPosted 21m ago 21 minutes ago Mon 24 Jun 2024 at 1:43am Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories This is what it's like to live in a flood recovery pod Northern Rivers towns pull out all the stops for Anzac Day despite devastating floods Rhonda Hayes calls them 'her sons, her grandsons, her angels' who helped her in her darkest hour 'I was terrified of being on the other end of the phone as Mum slowly drowned'",

    "text": "US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said legislators 'cannot simply shirk from our responsibilities' toward border security and Ukraine / © AFP/File\nThe US Senate will vote next week on a border security package that would unlock vital aid for Ukraine, Democrats announced Thursday, as President Joe Biden hailed a $54 billion package approved by the war-torn nation's European allies.\nChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader of the upper chamber of Congress, said an initial vote on the bipartisan bill would take place on Wednesday at the latest -- although its prospects for being signed into law look vanishingly small.\n\"Addressing these challenges is not easy. But we cannot simply shirk from our responsibilities just because a task is difficult,\" Schumer said, adding that the text would be released between Friday and Sunday.\nSenators have been negotiating for months on a deal to combat illegal immigration, with Republicans insisting on increased border security in return for approving a White House request for more than $60 billion for pro-Western Kyiv, which saw its invasion by Russia greatly expanded in 2022.\nMike Johnson, the speaker in the Republican-led House of Representatives, has declared the package \"dead on arrival,\" claiming without seeing the text that it does not go far enough in tackling a record influx of undocumented migrants across the southern border.\nFormer president Donald Trump -- who is running for reelection and is desperate to avoid Biden getting a legislative win -- has been speaking out loudly against the bill, which also includes money for Israel in its conflict with Hamas militants.\nTrump enjoys near-universal support among House Republicans, and his opposition is expected to kill the package's prospects of reaching Biden's desk.\nThe Democratic president called European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday to thank her for the bloc's approval of 50 billion euros ($54 billion) in aid for Ukraine, the White House said.\nBiden welcomed the \"significant financial aid package\" which will \"go a long way to helping Ukraine as they continue to battle back against Russia's aggression,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\nBiden called to \"applaud the European Union's historic decision,\" the White House said, and \"commended the European Union's steadfast support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russian aggression and fulfill the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of its citizens.\"\nVon der Leyen \"emphasized the critical importance of sustained US support to Ukraine, which has been indispensable to Ukraine's efforts to defend its people, cities and soldiers in its fight for freedom,\" according to the White House readout of the call.",

    "text": "DANIEL ISLAND, S.C. (WCBD)- Berkeley County has opened a new heliport on Daniel Island that officials say will help lower emergency response times. The helicopter landing pad near the off-ramp of I-526 and Seven Farms Drive can be used to airlift patients experiencing medical emergencies, such as a stroke, to area hospitals in less than seven minutes. “It is incredibly comforting to know that this Unit can be activated and to Daniel Island from its base in 3-5 minutes,” Councilman Josh Whitley said. “The helicopter can literally get the call while the ambulance is at the scene and be waiting on the ambulance at the pad in a minimal and effective response time. I hope we never need the pad, but I am grateful we have it.” The project is part of a larger effort to improve response times, especially during high traffic congestion or when the Wando or Don Holt bridges are shut down. “Emergency response time can mean the difference between life and death,” said Berkeley County EMS Chief Michael Shirey. “Having a faster and guaranteed way to transport critical care patients off the island is further proof that Emergency Medical Services in Berkeley County is meeting the needs of our growing population.” It will be used by Meducare’s dual-engine EC-145 helicopter, which officials said is “considered one of the biggest helicopters in civilian helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS),” allowing crews to transport multiple patients and equipment simultaneously. The helipad cost just over $55,000 to construct with funding from the county’s economic development fund and accommodations feed fund. County council approved funding for two additional helipads, which could be built next year.",

    "text": "Man attacks staffer at police headquarters\nBy Carlos Castañeda\nClick here for updates on this story\nPINOLE, California (\nKPIX) — A man was arrested in Pinole this week after attacking a staff member at the building that houses the Pinole police headquarters in an incident caught on surveillance camera.\nPinole police said in a Facebook post Wednesday that the incident happened Tuesday at about 4:15 p.m. at the Pinole Public Safety Building which houses the Pinole Police Department and Pinole Fire Station 73.\nA man entered the building at 880 Tennent Avenue and walked around the reception area while a police employee assisted another person at the front counter, police said. At first, the man used the drinking fountain and tried to open the locked lobby door to the police department’s inner office area. He then sat down and waited about two minutes while the staff member finished assisting the person at the counter.\nWhen the person left, the man approached the counter and was greeted by the staff member. Police said the man responded by reaching out and ringing the counter bell several times and seconds later, grabbing the staff member by her right arm and pulling her toward him. Surveillance video showed the staff member breaking free and retreating into the main hallway as the suspect climbed over the counter and through the counter window to chase after her.\nThe victim made her way to the administrative office area with the help of another staff member. Officers who heard the commotion rushed to the reception area and were able to confront and arrest the suspect without further incident, police said.\nThe suspect was identified as 65-year-old Chester Victor, a resident of unincorporated San Pablo. Officers booked Victor at the Martinez Detention Facility on charges of burglary, kidnapping, false imprisonment, battery, assault, and an outstanding warrant.\nThe staffer suffered minor injuries to her arm when the suspect pulled on her. Police did not provide a possible motive for the attack.\nAnyone with information was asked to contact the Pinole Police Department Criminal Investigation Division at\n[510-724-1111](tel:5107241111).\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

Aliás, existiu: quando o Hitler resolveu matar os judeus.\"\nPoucos brasileiros sabem que a conexão entre o povo judeu e o Brasil é muito antiga. De fato, a primeira e mais antiga comunidade judaica da América foi estabelecida no Brasil, onde os judeus sefarditas fundaram a primeira sinagoga em Recife, em 1636.\nFamílias de refugiados judeus da Iugoslávia vieram para a Albânia escapando do Holocausto - Museu Memorial do Holocausto dos Estados Unidos A Kahal Zur Israel (Congregação Rochedo de Israel) foi a primeira sinagoga das Américas. Funcionou em Pernambuco durante o período de dominação holandesa (1630 a 1657). Durante esse período, emigraram para o Recife milhares de judeus sefarditas de origem portuguesa, refugiados nos Países Baixos, que vieram para a então colônia holandesa atraídos pela liberdade de culto religioso.\nA comparação do presidente Lula foi um indicador inestimável de que uma parte da sociedade brasileira está sendo levada para um olhar pró-palestino cego, sem muita dimensão do que acontece em termos da violência física e simbólica naquele país, onde os direitos não são humanos.\nO dia 7 de outubro de 2023 , mulheres foram estupradas, crianças mortas, bebês sequestrados e a arrepiante lista poderia continuar. Falas como a do presidente Lula foram só gasolina jogada em cima do fogo.\nVeja linha do tempo de conflito entre Israel e Hamas ic_save\nMais\nic_share\nLeia Mais Ícone fechar Voltar Ver novamente Voltar\nVoltar\nCompartilhe Ícone Facebook Facebook Ícone Whatsapp Whatsapp Ícone Twitter Twitter Ícone de messenger Messenger Ícone Linkedin Linkedin Ícone de envelope E-mail Ícone de link Cadeado representando um link Copiar link Ícone fechar\nTem-se estendido uma narrativa superficial que não tem muito interesse em aprofundar no que Hamas é e representa, e quanto a violência daquele grupo tem se capilarizado na educação da sociedade palestina . Também não há muito interesse em entender que, nos bastidores, o grupo Hamas está ligado aos piores eixos do terrorismo internacional. Israel desejaria que a Palestina fosse uma democracia. Palestina deseja que Israel desapareça.\nPorém, desculpas, não é esse o assunto desta coluna. Trata-se, sem nenhuma dúvida, de um conflito antigo e complexo com muitas variáveis em jogo.\nOs dados têm mostrado que o antissemitismo cresceu (e muito) no Brasil depois da invasão de Hamas sobre o território de Israel. Só no mês seguinte ao ataque do 7 de outubro de Hamas , os casos de antissemitismo no Brasil cresceram mais de dez vezes conforme relatório da Confederação Israelita do Brasil (Conib). Naquele mês, a organização detectou 467 casos de mensagens em redes sociais ou eventos públicos ofensivos ao povo judeu, ante 44 ocorridos no mesmo período de 2022, um aumento de 961%.\nPrecisamos de espaços para conversar sobre o antissemitismo crescente no país. No mundo corporativo existem algumas iniciativas na região para tentar gerar conversações sobre o antissemitismo. Um exemplo disso é a JAE3, Rede de Empresários, Executivos e Empresários Judeus Argentinos, criada por um grupo de executivos e empreendedores. Trata-se de um espaço apolítico e não-religioso de luta contra o antissemitismo com o objetivo de trabalhar por um mundo tolerante, diverso, inclusivo e democrático na sociedade e representar os membros da comunidade judaica na Argentina e sua identidade.\nHoje abriga mais de 500 líderes argentinos, judeus e não-judeus, unidos para trabalhar por esta causa naquele país. Entre os fundadores estão Diego Bekerman (GM LATAM Microsoft), Verónica Cheja (Urban Grupo), Carolina Zang (Zang, Bergel y Viñes), Valeria Abadi (Globant), Ezequiel Herzsage (IRSA), Diego Yanni (Accenture) e Mariano Filarent (Meta).\nA degradação das sociedades é paulatina. Como a rede JAE3, necessitamos de outros espaços de reflexão e visualização deste fenômeno de ódio social. Precisamos estar atentos e conversar sobre o crescimento do antissemitismo no Brasil. Por quê? Muito simples, porque calar não é uma alternativa.\nLINK PRESENTE: Gostou deste texto? Assinante pode liberar sete acessos gratuitos de qualquer link por dia.

    "text": "Le dimanche 6 octobre 2024, à l’initiative de Bretagne Vivante, les Morlaisiens pourront, sur réservation, visiter un jardin qui favorise la protection de la biodiversité. Rencontre avec deux des initiatrices du projet, Corinne Créau et Élisabeth Le Rumeur.\nBretagne Vivante, créée en 1958, mène une action intitulée Regain, destinée à favoriser la protection de la biodiversité et le retour d’espèces dans les jardins des particuliers. Dans ce cadre, l’association organise le dimanche 6 octobre 2024, de 14 h à 18 h, la visite du jardin d’un Morlaisien. Comme le détaillent Corinne Créau et Élisabeth Le Rumeur, « Un jardin, c’est un réservoir de biodiversité. Le pari est donc de réaliser des actions concrètes de la reconquête de cette diversité biologique dite ordinaire en Bretagne, en amenant les particuliers à devenir acteurs d’une nature préservée dans leur propre espace. Il importe de recréer des zones d’accueil, notamment pour les insectes, car par ricochet, cela veut dire le retour des oiseaux, des reptiles et des petits mammifères ».",
