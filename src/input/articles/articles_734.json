Ventura isn't the only place experiencing tumultuous coasts. The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii. A video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance. Suddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves. Another angle captured by [Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him](https://www.facebook.com/1 103854833/videos/339998562146021/) down the street. Officials urged people to avoid the ocean. [High surf is expected](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=LOX&issuedby=LOX&product=AFD&format=ci&version=1&glossary=1) through Saturday.

Brian McGrath said. The injured were taken to the nearby hospitals. Residents in the neighborhoods near the incident were advised to leave, said Cmdr. Ryan Weeks with the Ventura Police Department. The patrons of a nearby hotel were also asked to leave. Roads in and around those areas were also closed.

    "text": "Photo: Alex Wong / Getty Images News / Getty Images\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a significant restructuring plan on Thursday (March 27), which includes cutting 10,000 full-time employees across various health agencies. This reduction follows the voluntary departure of another 10,000 employees, bringing the workforce down from 82,000 to 62,000. The changes aim to save $1.8 billion annually and refocus the department's priorities.\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr . stated that the restructuring will consolidate the department from 28 to 15 divisions , including the creation of a new Administration for a Healthy America. This new administration will merge several existing agencies, such as the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Health Resources and Services Administration, to focus on primary care, mental health, and environmental health, among other areas.\nThe department will also reduce its regional offices from 10 to five and ensure that essential services like Medicare and Medicaid remain intact. The restructuring includes creating a new assistant secretary for enforcement and an Office of Strategy to enhance research and policy effectiveness.\nThe job cuts, mainly targeting administrative roles, will affect 8,000 to 10,000 employees, with specific notices expected soon. The changes will primarily impact high-cost regions and redundant roles within HHS. The American Federation of Government Employees union has been notified and may negotiate the impact and implementation of the cuts.\nThe overhaul is expected to face scrutiny and potential challenges, as it represents a significant shift in how the department operates.",

    "text": "A US-Israeli woman seized in the October 7 Hamas attack was killed on the same day and her body remains in the Gaza Strip, her kibbutz community said on Thursday.\nJudith Weinstein Haggai, 70, had been thought to be the oldest woman among the hostages still held in Gaza by the Palestinian militant group.\nHer kibbutz of Nir Oz said that Haggai was \"murdered in the massacre\", and that her body remains in the war-torn Palestinian territory.\nThursday's announcement by the community follows confirmation on December 23 that her husband, Gad Haggai, was also killed on October 7.\n\"The bodies of both are still in the custody of Hamas,\" the community said, without elaborating.\nThe couple were among some 250 people taken hostage from Israeli border communities and military posts.\nMore than 100 of those abducted have since been freed, many exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.\nIsrael says 129 captives are still missing in Gaza, including 23 believed to have been killed.\nThree hostages were mistakenly shot dead by soldiers in the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli army.\n\"There are no words to describe the pain of losing our parents and grandparents to the massacre that took place on our kibbutz,\" the family of Haggai said in a statement.\n\"We pray that their bodies... will be soon returned to us, and that their murders are a reminder for leaders everywhere to bring the hostages home now before it is too late.\"\nIn Washington, President Joe Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden were \"devastated\" by the news.\nThe slain couple's family has been \"living through hell for weeks,\" he said, pledging that the United States will \"not stop working to bring\" remaining hostages home.\nAhl Haggai, the couple's son, has said that in a final phone call on October 7, his mother had told a paramedic that she and her husband had both been wounded.\n\"The only evidence we have... is a video of my dad on the back of a truck, laying down injured,\" he told AFP earlier this month.\n\"She's nowhere to be found,\" he said, with only his mother's glasses recovered from the kibbutz.\nIsraelis have held frequent rallies to highlight the plight of the remaining hostages and put pressure on the authorities to secure their release, with hundreds marching to parliament on Thursday.\n\"Bring them home!\" they chanted outside the assembly in Jerusalem, an AFP journalist reported.\n\"All I can hope is that as many people (as possible) will remain alive,\" Nikki Littman, 55, who took part in the rally, told AFP.\n\"I don't trust the government. I don't trust Hamas. I fear Hamas. I fear our existence here,\" said Littman, who teaches Japanese at a university.\nThe October 7 Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.\nIsrael's relentless offensive on Gaza has since killed 21,320 people, mostly civilians, according to the latest toll from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.",

    "text": "Health workers of the Sarajevo Canton, due to the failure to reach an agreement with the Cantonal Government on salary increases, have announced a one-hour blockade of the Skenderija road from all directions for today from 12:00 to 13:00. However, they did not receive approval to change the traffic regime.\nThe President of the KS Health Workers’ Union, Senad Sadiković, pointed out that they did not give up blocking the main road, but that they received a response from the Ministry of Transport that they could not block it due to ongoing works.\n“We have decided to withdraw in front of the Canton Government, where our colleagues are staying in tents and where we will stay until the Canton Government offers us an acceptable hourly rate,” said Sadiković.\nHe announced that he will continue with the protests until their demands are met.\n“We are announcing for next week, on Thursday, a protest walk from the Eternal Flame to the Canton Government, where we will protest again. As soon as the conditions for a general strike are met, after the reconciliation that needs to be carried out, we will go on a general strike,” he said, adding that the conciliation process lasts 30 days.\nLet us remind you that the basic demand that healthcare workers are asking for is an increase in their hourly wages. The union submitted a request for the net hourly rate to be 3.70, while the Government offered 3.25. The union says that the offer is unacceptable.\nphoto: archive",

Si el miércoles supo que el Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos quiere obligarla a vender el negocio de Chrome para acabar con su monopolio, el jueves se filtró que [OpenAI](/tags/openai/), su rival y fabricante de [ChatGPT](/tags/chatgpt/), estudia la posibilidad de desarrollar un navegador web propio para desbancarla.\nSegún publica The Information, la start-up de inteligencia artificial financiada por [Microsoft](/tags/microsoft/) se plantea crear un producto de navegación por Internet que combinaría con su chatbot, si bien esa posibilidad está aún lejos de materializarse.\nCon este movimiento, OpenAI podría tratar de plantar cara a Google. Chrome es el navegador más popular del mundo, pues concentra un 67% de ese mercado, según datos de Statcounter, muy por delante de rivales como Safari, Edge o Firefox. Competir con Google es una misión titánica, pero eso podría cambiar si la justicia estadounidense termina obligando a la compañía a desprenderse de su navegador.\nAmbas noticias han hecho que la capitalización de Google se resienta en bolsa. En las últimas 24 horas, sus acciones se han devaluado un 4,56%.\nBuscador contra Google\nNo es la primera vez que OpenAI reta a Google. A finales de julio, la empresa capitaneada por Sam Altman anunció el lanzamiento de SearchGPT, el prototipo de un motor de búsqueda que se sirve de IA para dar respuesta a las consultas de los usuarios. Un año antes, Microsoft integró esa tecnología en su buscador Bing y en su navegador Edge a través de Copilot, un asistente conversacional que acompaña al usuario durante la navegación web.\nEl dominio de Google en ese campo es aún más abrumador, pues su servicio concentra casi el 90% del mercado mundial de las búsquedas web. Aun así, las maniobras de Microsoft y OpenAI han obligado a Google a mover ficha. A finales de 2023, el gigante tecnológico dirigido por Sundar Pichai lanzó su propio modelo de IA, Gemini, y lo integró a sus servicios para tratar de mejorar las búsquedas y neutralizar a sus rivales.\nOpenAI también está buscando otras fórmulas para ganar terreno a Google. Según The Information, la firma está estudiando la posibilidad de potenciar las funciones de IA en los móviles y tabletas fabricados por la surcoreana Samsung, tradicional socio comercial de Google. En junio, la creadora de ChatGPT anunció una nueva alianza para alimentar los dispositivos de Apple, que cobra unos 12.000 millones de dólares anuales de Google para que su navegador y su buscador estén instalados por defecto.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=OpenAI%20planea%20crear%20un%20navegador%20web%20con%20IA%20para%20competir%20con%20Google%20https://www.laprovincia.es/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938114.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.laprovincia.es/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938114.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.laprovincia.es/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938114.html&text=OpenAI%20planea%20crear%20un%20navegador%20web%20con%20IA%20para%20competir%20con%20Google%20%20https://www.laprovincia.es/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938114.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40laprovincia_es)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=OpenAI%20planea%20crear%20un%20navegador%20web%20con%20IA%20para%20competir%20con%20Google%20&body=https://www.laprovincia.es/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938114.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil\n[Si tienes este CD en casa te puedes llevar una alegría: vale tanto como un coche nuevo](https://www.laprovincia.es/vida-y-estilo/2024/11/24/tienes-cd-casa-puedes-llevar-dv-111948329.html)[Cierra el hotel Avenida de Canarias de Vecindario](https://www.laprovincia.es/gran-canaria/2024/11/25/cierra-hotel-avenida-canarias-vecindario-112033138.html)[Mohamed Lemine Khattary: «Hay que mirar a Mauritania para saber lo que pasará en Canarias»](https://www.laprovincia.es/canarias/2024/11/26/mohamed-amin-kattari-hay-mirar-112074890.html)[El municipio de Canarias que ha sido reconocido como Pueblo Mágico 2025](https://www.laprovincia.es/gran-canaria/2024/11/25/municipio-canarias-sido-reconocido-pueblo-magico-dv-112023377.html)[Así es el oasis de Anabel Pantoja en Gran Canaria: la acogedora casa donde vivirá con su hija Alma y su novio David Rodríguez](https://www.laprovincia.es/gran-canaria/2024/11/26/oasis-anabel-pantoja-gran-canaria-dv-112054722.html)[Multa de 3.000 euros por pescar en Las Canteras](https://www.laprovincia.es/las-palmas/2024/11/26/multa-3-000-euros-pescar-112057094.html)[Esta es la fecha en la que los pensionistas van a recibir el ingreso de 734 euros en su cuenta](https://www.laprovincia.es/economia/2024/11/24/fecha-pensionistas-recibir-ingreso-734-dv-111947911.html)[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria estrena un espectáculo navideño con luces y villancicos: estas son las horas y ubicación](https://www.laprovincia.es/las-palmas/2024/11/25/palmas-gran-canaria-estrena-espectaculo-112022395.html)",

    "title": "Bethlehem Christmas Eve celebrations halted due to Israel-Hamas war",
    "text": "Bethlehem, West Bank – The normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus resembled a ghost town on Sunday, as Christmas Eve celebrations in Bethlehem were called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing, as were the throngs of foreign tourists and jubilant youth marching bands that gather in the West Bank town each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrolled the empty square.\n“This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness,” said Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years.\nHe said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, reminiscent of the thousands of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounded the scene, the grey rubble reflecting none of the joyous lights and bursts of color that normally fill the square during the Christmas season.\nThe cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season.\nWith many major airlines canceling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say over 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed.\nGift shops were slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did once the rain had stopped pouring down. There were few visitors, however.\n“We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to,” said Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square.\nSalameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” said Salameh. This year, just one table was taken, by journalists taking a break from the rain.\nUnder a banner that read “Bethlehem's Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santas, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence.\n“Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it's a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip,” Bethlehem's mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address to the crowd.\nOver 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault Oct. 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages.\nThe Gaza war has been accompanied by a surge in violence, with some 300 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire.\nThe fighting has affected life across the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.\nAmir Michael Giacaman opened his store, “Il Bambino,” which sells olive wood carvings and other souvenirs, for the first time since Oct. 7. There have been no tourists, and few local residents have money to spare because those who worked in Israel have been stuck at home.\n“When people have extra money, they go buy food,” said his wife, Safa Giacaman. \"This year, we're telling the Christmas story. We're celebrating Jesus, not the tree, not Santa Claus, she said, as their daughter Makaella ran around the deserted store.\nKeywords:\nML-Bethlehem-Christmas, 2nd Ld-Writethru\nCategory:\nNews/World\nPublisher:\nDNATOM.\nUrgency:\nRegular\nCategory (wire):\ni+a\nSupplementary category (wire):",

    "text": "KERRVILLE, Texas — As search and recovery efforts continue for those missing after the tragic Guadalupe River flooding, a nonprofit made up primarily of veteran operators is making an impact.\nSince they arrived on July 5, a day after the catastrophic and historic flooding that overwhelmed parts of the Texas Hill Country, Heroes for Humanity has assisted in the recovery of 17 people. The organization is made up of former military personnel and first responders who now answer the call when disasters strike.\n\"Austere environment is something that these guys really thrive on,\" said Brian Chrisenberry, the crisis response operator for the group. \"We want to go where others don't.\"\nChrisenberry said as they watched the news of the Central Texas floods unfold, their team was ready to jump into action.\n\"These guys are used to rappelling down mountains and doing all kinds of rescues already. That's been really beneficial here.\"\nOne of the organization's missions is search-and-rescue operations. They've been assisting with the operations of heavy machinery, as well as air operations and water recoveries.\n\"John over here is about to do a deep-water recovery, he’s one of the only people on site that is actually trained to go down an recover underwater,\" Chrisenberry said.\nCadaver dogs have also been an important asset, he added. When they target a spot, sonar is used to pinpoint where they need to search.\nWhile Monday's dive mission didn't yield any recoveries, the 30-man team that makes up Heroes for Humanity assisted in the recoveries of two people on Sunday.\n“He was able to dive down underneath some rubble and locate a mother and child that was underneath a car that was submerged, \" Chrisenberry said.\nOne of the hardest parts of the recovery operations, he says, isn't the physical part of their mission--it's the emotional and spiritual aspects.\n“I’ve had a lot of people come up to me that have lost their children and loved ones and thanked me,\" he said. \"It’s hard to even hear that because they have closure, but we haven’t pulled anybody out alive.”\nThe organization plans to be in Kerr County for as long as it takes and is looking for monetary donations to continue its mission.

    "text": "能跳舞还会做俯卧撑，能踢足球还会“叶问蹲”——在中关村论坛年会的展示区，来自一家京企的人形机器人秀起绝活儿。足球比赛的激烈对抗中，机器人摔倒在地，只见它鲤鱼打挺般迅速起身投入比赛，令观众惊叹不已。\n“这款Booster T1机器人的优势是轻巧灵活、皮实耐摔，我们希望助力人形机器人‘加速进化’。”一旁解说的程昊语调透着自信。他所创立的公司名字，就叫“加速进化”。\n2013年这家公司创立时，人形机器人还处于早期探索阶段。程昊选择入局这一前沿赛道，与他的专业背景密不可分。\n程昊是北京人，2006年进入清华大学自动化系学习，在校期间就加入了清华火神足球队，多次参加RoboCup（机器人世界杯）比赛。不过当时机器人算法还比较初级，传感器、AI技术等并不成熟，2013年硕士毕业后，他的创业之路首先在智能助理领域开启，研发的产品很快被互联网大厂收购，但与人形机器人早早结下的缘分，让他一直关注着机器人领域的新机遇。\n2022年特斯拉人形机器人发布，2023年大模型横空出世，一个变革的时代呼啸而来。程昊重新燃起了机器人创业梦。他和在校期间的导师赵国明教授深入探讨入局人形机器人的时机，坚信人形机器人行业在未来十年将迎来巨大爆发。\n“智商”远远不够，曾经是人们对机器人的普遍印象，但大模型的出现，将语义理解能力和推理生成能力引入智能机器人行业，机器人终于开始拥有了“大脑”。“仿佛在黑暗世界里摸索时，有一束光打了进来。”程昊看好大模型驱动下的人形机器人发展前景。\n“创业团队一定要善于抢跑。”在他看来，创业就是要做难且有挑战的事。2013年9月，程昊创立了北京加速进化科技有限公司，赵国明任首席科学家，团队核心成员都出身于清华自动化系机器人控制实验室及火神足球队。\n依靠清华团队在人形机器人领域多年的积累，公司成立不到两个月，就研发出第一代工程机BR001。但它走10分钟就会发热，摔一下就坏，行动也很迟缓。为了开发出性能更强大的人形机器人，团队将“踢足球”作为人形机器人的训练重点，让机器人进行高难度的足球运动，找到薄弱点，倒逼运动控制算法突破。\n程昊有个理念：“不敢摔机器人的公司，做不好机器人。”机器人一次次跌倒爬起，研发人员夜以继日找问题，为机器人髋关节设计了3个可360度旋转的关节。独特的关节设计与团队运控算法结合，使得迭代后的BR002机器人能完成横向劈叉、纵向劈叉等高难度动作。\n2024年4月，美国机器人公司波士顿动力推出的电驱版Atlas人形机器人，能原地旋转起身、平稳行走、360度全身旋转，引发全网热议。程昊看到后，带领团队用3天时间完美复现“旋转起身”这一动作，视频全网观看量超200万次。在机器人运控算法上的深厚积累，让这家新兴创业公司迅速脱颖而出。\n程昊对行业趋势的判断得到应验。2024年这一年，人形机器人火爆全球，越来越多的公司涌入这一赛道，加速进化公司开始探索人形机器人的商业化场景。在2024年8月的世界机器人大会上，产品版机器人Booster T1亮相，10月起正式对外出货。\n“我们是为数不多的可以全球交付人形机器人的公司，3月初交付了第100台，客户分布在美国、德国、瑞士、日本、韩国、新加坡等。”程昊说，公司主打开发者市场，多数产品都交付高校实验室或科技公司，供客户二次开发，也应用在比赛活动、文旅互动展演场景。\n人形机器人，还能在哪些领域大展身手？展演、教育、服务、巡检、送餐……程昊认为，人形机器人正加速走进各行各业、千家万户，市场有望在未来十年迎来爆发式增长。在他看来，人形机器人的机会不再像之前信息革命、互联网出现时的状态，而是国内和国际相当于同时起步，中国企业都有机会深度参与这一次产业革命。\n记者手记\n机器人创业公司在京“更容易成功”\n加速进化抢抓机遇，很快就在人形机器人发展的浪潮中站稳了脚跟，获得多轮融资。这背后有何成功秘籍？\n过硬的技术和人才是最重要因素。核心团队成员都是清华大学自动化系出身，创始人还曾在互联网大厂摸爬滚打多年，加速进化是业内少有的兼具硬件、算法和商业化全方位能力的团队，让人形机器人走出高校实验室，走向市场接受检验。\n如果说科技创新从“0到1”是突破实验室的原始创新，那么从“1到10”则是跨越技术与市场鸿沟的关键跃迁。这一阶段，需要创新土壤的精心培育，也需要耐心资本的深度赋能。\n机器人领域创业在北京“更容易成功”，这是程昊的心声。他说，北京有高水平的高校科研院所和优质人才资源，有支持人形机器人等未来产业发展的利好政策，是智能机器人的产业高地。政府搭建的机器人大会、中关村论坛等平台为公司带来无限发展机会，加速进化的投资者中，还有中关村科学城的身影。\n人形机器人是未来产业的关键赛道，正展现出巨大的市场潜力和发展前景。当前，北京在机器人科技产业创新、拓展场景应用、加强要素保障等方面加大政策支持，积极推动产业链各环节协同创新，更多科技类民营公司将在各自赛道上跑出“加速度”。\n来源：北京日报\n记者：潘福达\n 流程编辑：u028\n如遇作品内容、版权等问题，请在相关文章刊发之日起30日内与本网联系。版权侵权联系电话：010-85202353",

    "text": "As former Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos runs for Congress , the Fight For Florida PAC is leaving nothing to chance.\nA six-figure ad buy will hit the Indian Harbour Beach Republican markets from Orlando to Palm Beach. A broadcast ad will make clear the Rockledge Republican is the man former President Donald Trump wants representing the Space Coast in Congress.\n“Mike Haridopolos is endorsed by Donald Trump and prominent Republicans across Florida because they know that he will be a fighter for his district and the state,” said Fight for Florida PAC Senior Advisor Chris Hartline .\n“As he always has, Mike Haridopolos will fight against reckless spending, shut down illegal immigration, and keep Florida free. Fight for Florida PAC is proud to support Mike and will continue showing voters why he’s the best choice in the August primary and the November general election.”\nHaridopolos has also secured endorsements from U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott , and from House Speaker Mike Johnson .\nThe ad shows Haridopolos in various settings and touring his legislative record from his time in Tallahassee.\n“Mike Haridopolos has fought to stop reckless spending, shut down illegal immigration and keep Florida free,” a narrator says. “That’s why Mike Haridopolos is endorsed by Donald Trump. Mike Haridopolos will fight for Florida, fight back against the career politicians in Washington. Congress needs more leaders who know how to fight.”\nThis is the second major ad buy from the Fight for Florida super PAC since it launched earlier this month .\nPosey is the front-runner for the open U.S. House seat representing Florida’s 8th Congressional District. He served for years as U.S. Rep. Bill Posey’s finance director, and Posey announced his own support for Haridopolos when he announced his retirement from Congress.\nHaridopolos faces Republicans Joe Babits and John Hearton in a Republican Primary. Both had initially filed to challenge Posey. Democrats Sandy Kennedy and Daniel McDow also filed in the Republican-leaning district.",
