    "title": "To reduce injuries to cops and suspects, Torrance’s Gracie University brings Brazilian jiujitsu to police – Press Enterprise",
    "text": "Tucked into the corner of a business plaza only a minute’s drive from downtown Torrance, an unassuming building is headquarters for Gracie University, a martial arts academy that local to federal officers arrive to learn defensive techniques.\nAfter the severe beating of Rodney King by officers in 1991, the Los Angeles Police Department brought in Ultimate Fighting Championship co-founder Rorion Gracie as an expert consultant to teach tactics of Brazilian jiujitsu suitable for interactions with civilians in a nonviolent way, said Rener Gracie, one of Rorion’s sons and now Gracie University’s CEO.\nOther departments followed.\n“We’ve been here for 25 years doing this but it wasn’t until post-George Floyd that we saw a massive surge in terms of interest from agencies trying to get their officers better trained,” said Rener Gracie, who is in partnership with brother Ryron. “They were desperate for a solution, civilians were desperate for a solution, and jiujitsu is where they landed.”\nRener, 40, is the grandson of Helio Gracie, who along with his older brother Carlos Gracie, modified and adapted the techniques of Japanese jiujitsu into a form called Brazilian jiujitsu, a grappling martial art that teaches practitioners to utilize their leverage, grip, and position to control a resistant opponent — including those who may be larger or stronger.\nRorion Gracie left Brazil for for America in 1978 and began teaching classes out of his Hermosa Beach garage. As demand for classes increased, the Gracie family opened its first jiujitsu academy, in 1989, in Hermosa Beach. By the early 2000s, the demand paved the way for Gracie Survival Tactics, a specialized law-enforcement training program now based in Torrance. The course aims to create a de-escalation culture among police departments, fostering calm decision-making to reduce injuries to officers and civilians alike.\n(Overall, the Gracie brothers mostly teach those who just want to learn the sport. “We (Gracie University) are comprised of a global network of over 250 Certified Training Centers, all of which are operated by instructors who’ve been personally certified by my brother and I in Torrance,” Rener Gracie said. The extended Gracie family has opened up various other training facilities in Southern California that are separate entities.)\n“Historically, and today, it remains true in many agencies: Officers in America are disastrously under-trained,” Rener Gracie said. “It’s shocking how few hours they get. Some states have zero annual training requirements for a police officer who is interacting with the public physically on a daily basis.”\nInstructors Tom Chuckerel, top, and Ryron Gracie during a Gracie Survival Tactics class for law enforcement officers at Gracie University.

But officers do learn how to defend against neck restraints if they were to be placed in one by a suspect, said Charlie Fernandez, director of Gracie Survival Tactics.\nAgencies that have sent employees to Gracie University include Homeland Security, the New Jersey Police Training Commission, the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, and all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, Gracie officials said.\nAttendees, usually police-defense instructors from their respective departments, spend five days at Gracie University, training a total of 30 hours. The cost is $1,200, usually picked up by the department but sometimes by the officer. The cops often return to their agencies and teach the techniques to personnel there.\nTechniques taught in Gracie Survival Tactics factor in weapon retention and handcuffing procedures and take into account the chance an officer’s mobility is limited because of his or her uniform and equipment.\nPeter Hanink, an assistant professor in the Sociology Department at Cal Poly Pomona who studies interactions between police and the public, said there are no official statistics for how often police force results in a death, or how often force is used at all.\n“Is it better to use submission holds than bullets? Of course!” he said. “But will that make excessive force less common? That’s much less certain.”\nHanink said it seems more likely that cases involving unnecessary deadly force were the result of poor judgment, such as using force longer than it was required, rather than inadequate training. Many police agencies across the country require other officers to step in and stop an officer from using excessive force, he added.\nRelated Articles Crime and Public Safety | Hemet Police Chief Eddie Pust retires, is replaced by veteran officer Crime and Public Safety | What recent California crime trends say about what to expect in 2024 Crime and Public Safety | Two Riverside men hole up in stolen motorhome after Rancho Cucamonga pursuit Crime and Public Safety | San Bernardino power outage temporarily darkens Inland Center mall just before Christmas Crime and Public Safety | Man with ‘bludgeon-type weapon’ is shot, injured by San Bernardino police after pursuit Placentia Sgt. Jason Alcala took an interest in the program after seeing how effective martial arts was for his son.\nTo the sergeant, the biggest takeaway from bringing jiujitsu fundamentals to policing is a safer environment for suspects and officers.\nSgt. Alcala intended to introduce jiujitsu training to his department. He hopes to inspire other officers to train on their days off.\n“Using jiujitsu is a much more humane way of taking people into custody and keeping them under control,” Alcala said. “By and large, you don’t have to strike suspects, it minimizes damage to both the officer and suspect, and it’s a good conditioning tool.”",

We will not let people get away with anything,\" Darmanin said in a statement on X.\nIn an earlier statement, Darmanin said he had given instructions to issue a ministerial deportation order against \"this radical 'imam' with unacceptable remarks\". \"Firmness is the rule,\" he added.\nIn a post that went viral on social media and was widely reported in French media, the imam referred to \"the three-coloured flag\" as \"satanic\".\nMahjoubi, who preached in the Ettaouba mosque of Bagnols-sur-Ceze, southern France, has denied any wrongdoing. He told French media that his comments had been taken out of context and that he had not meant to disrespect the French flag. The French flag has three colours: blue, white and red.\nHis lawyer told French media he will appeal the expulsion procedure.\nFrench media published excerpts of the expulsion order, which stated that Mahjoubi had \"conveyed a literal, backward, intolerant, and violent conception of Islam, likely to encourage behaviors contrary to the values of the Republic, discrimination against women, identity retreat, tensions with the Jewish community, and jihadist radicalization'.\"\nBFM reported that Mahjoubi was being held in administrative detention in the Paris region.\nDarmanin did not specify where the imam had been held nor when, how and where to he was expelled.\nFranceinfo reported that Mahjoubi was on a plane headed to Tunis on Thursday evening.\nDarmanin said that the French government's new immigration law, voted earlier this year, had allowed for the quick expulsion of the imam.\nWith the far-right RN party leading in polls for European elections in June, President Emmanuel Macron is under pressure to be tough on immigration and identity issues.\nFrance expels 'radical' Tunisian imam - interior minister",

    "text": "Pierce Brosnan faces charges after allegedly walking in Yellowstone's thermal areas Actor Pierce Brosnan could be facing possible jail time after allegedly walking in Yellowstone National Park's hydrothermal areas in violation of federal law, according to court documents. Brosnan is facing citations of \"foot travel in all thermal areas and w/in Yellowstone Canyon confined to trails\" and \"violating closures and use limits,\" the court record shows. Criminal charges were filed against the Irish actor in Wyoming on Tuesday. [Federal law states](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-36/chapter-I/part-7/section-7.13): \"Foot travel in all thermal areas and within the Yellowstone Canyon between the Upper Falls and Inspiration Point must be confined to boardwalks or trails that are maintained for such travel and are marked by official signs.\" A representative for the 70-year-old Brosnan, who is best known [for his stint as James Bond](https://www.npr.org/2012/10/05/162175114/picking-the-best-bond-connery-and-craig-rise-to-the-top) in films in the 1990s, didn't respond to NPR's request for comment. What's the big deal? Within Yellowstone National Park's roughly 2.2 million acres there [are more than 10,000](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/parkfacts.htm)different hydrothermal features, like geysers and hot springs. The park provides many [guidelines and warnings](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm) online and throughout the park for visitors to be aware of the dangers posed by hot springs and the like. The park says, \"Hot springs have injured or killed more people in Yellowstone than any other natural feature.\" More than 20 people have died after entering or accidentally falling into Yellowstone's hot springs, [according to the park](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/thermal-basin-exploring.htm) because certain thermal pools can reach deadly temperatures of over 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Still, a number of visitors to the park, like allegedly Brosnan, [violate this law when they visit Yellowstone](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/06/22/video-shows-pair-leave-yellowstone-boardwalk-to-dip-fingers-in-175-degree-thermals/) — some incidents leading to serious injury or even death. In August, a 49-year-old Michigan man was arraigned in federal court for traveling off-trail in Yellowstone's thermal area. Jason Wicks suffered thermal burns and was banned from Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks until his criminal charges are resolved, [according to the park.](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/23034.htm) Other violators in recent years have [faced a week](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/210826.htm)to [a 10-day jail sentence](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/20001.htm), hundreds of dollars in fines and a lengthy ban from Yellowstone.

    "text": "(The Center Square) – Thousands of Amazon workers in the U.S. and abroad are striking from Black Friday to Cyber Monday.\nWorkers have participated in the annual strike for five straight years as part of “Make Amazon Pay” movement.\nSpearheaded by UNI Global Union and Progressive International, the protests include street demonstrations of Amazon workers, unions, and civil society groups in more than 30 countries, including the U.S., Germany, Brazil and Japan.\nThe participants are demanding increased wages and better working conditions, saying they aim to “hold Amazon accountable for labour abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy.”\n“Amazon’s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy,” General Secretary of UNI Global Union Christy Hoffman said this week in a press release. “Bezos’s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers’ desire for justice–for union representation–can’t be stopped.\nMore from this section Judge denies Sean Combs bail: court order Australia ban cycling's Richardson for life after UK defection Uber and Bolt unveil women-only service in Paris “We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all,\" she continued. \"‘Make Amazon Pay Day’ is becoming a global act of resistance against Amazon’s abuse of power.\"\nAs of Sept. 30, the average pay for customer fulfillment and operations roles at Amazon is approximately $22 per hour , with benefits available. The company says it also invested $2.2 billion in 2024 to increase wages and benefits, equivalent to a $3,000 average annual increase for full-time employees.\nIn a statement to multiple news outlets, Amazon accused the strike organizers of being “intentionally misleading” and spreading a “false narrative” about the company’s working conditions.\n“The fact is, at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities — all from day one,” Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said. “We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world, and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings.”\nOriginally published on thecentersquare.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

    "text": "[House](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) Rep. Turner says it was ‘very important’ Biden took action against Houthis ‘to diminish their overall capability’ Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said it was “very important” that President Biden took action against the Houthis in the wake of recent strikes conducted against the Yemeni militant group. “You can’t play defense continuously, and you have to let them know that they’re not going to be able to continue this,” Turner said Thursday on CNN. “So, it’s very important that the president took the step in Yemen to hit the Houthis, to begin to diminish their overall capabilities, but they need to know they’re gonna be paying a price for trying to diminish the ability to have commercial shipping.” The Houthis have [faced strikes](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4416914-us-battle-houthis-no-signs-stopping/) from the U.S. recently, beginning last week in [retaliation to](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4404218-us-uk-retaliatory-strike-houthis-yemen/) Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. They have [attacked](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4414834-us-fourth-strike-on-houthis/) cargo ships including U.S.-owned ships and U.S. Navy vessels in recent weeks. “Today’s defensive action follows this extensive diplomatic campaign and Houthi rebels’ escalating attacks against commercial vessels,” Biden said last Thursday. “These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes.” “I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary,” Biden said. The Houthis have said that they will keep fighting as long as Israeli soldiers are fighting in Gaza in their war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. “Americans want the seas to be safe for the support and resources provided to the Israeli enemy while starving the Palestinian people,” Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said Thursday. “We warn against weariness towards the oppression of the Palestinian people. The longer the siege and starvation continue, the greater the responsibility on our nation.” [Houthi attacks]( https://thehill.com/tag/houthi-attacks/ ) [houthi strikes]( https://thehill.com/tag/houthi-strikes/ ) [Houthis]( https://thehill.com/tag/houthis/ ) [Houthis]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/houthis/ ) [Joe ) [Mike Turner]( https://thehill.com/people/mike-turner/ ) [Mike Turner]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/mike-turner/ ) [Red Sea]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/red-sea/ ) [Yemen]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/yemen/ House News [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [See All](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) ",
