    "title": "Board: Nurse tested positive for drugs at hospital, poses a danger to public - NewsBreak",
    "text": "(Photo courtesy of the Iowa Board of Nursing) The Iowa Board of Nursing has issued an emergency order suspending the license of a nurse who allegedly tested positive for drugs while working at an Iowa hospital in 2023. The board has charged Audrie Hubbard of Ringgold County, a registered nurse, with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs; with being involved in the unauthorized possession or use of a controlled substance; and with failing to comply with an order of the board. The board alleges that in October 2023, while working at the Greater Regional Health hospitals and clinics in Creston, Hubbard texted a coworker and indicated she had a flat tire, then failed to respond to messages from the hospital staff. According to the board, Hubbard was at work the following day when a coworker grew concerned that Hubbard was showing “signs indicating substance use.” Hubbard was allegedly asked to complete a urine drug screen and a breath test while still on duty. According to the board, the test results were positive for alcohol and marijuana use and Hubbard admitted having consumed a THC gummy. Hubbard was enrolled in an employee-assistance program but allegedly failed to stay in contact with program officials and was fired from the hospital in February 2024, according to board records. Eight months later, the Board of Nursing issued a confidential order of some unspecified nature against Hubbard. According to the board, Hubbard failed to comply with that order and has not responded to any of the board’s subsequent attempts to contact her. Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Hubbard for comment. The board alleges Hubbard has engaged in unethical behavior by practicing nursing while under the influence, by the use of a controlled substance and by failing to comply with a board order. Based on those findings, the board has determined Hubbard poses “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.” As a result, the board on Jan. 16, 2025, issued an emergency order suspending Hubbard’s license for an indefinite period and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Feb. 18, 2025. The emergency order was only made public this week and the board has not disclosed whether the hearing took place.",

    "title": "Seraphina Returns with New “Life After Love” Single and Music Video",
    "text": "Chicago’s Seraphina returns with a heavy-hitting “…comeback from heartbreak…” type of joint entitled “ Life After Love “. From the opening background scream of frustration to the heavy metal guitar-led musicbed the young dynamo gets after it in a superior fashion. The single is accompanied by a cinematic music video that harkens back to a different era but the message is clear…love lost is not a new thing, why haven’t humans evolved beyond centuries-old pain.\nThe main question of the song is, “Will anger consume you within your love life…how will you cope”…Seraphina certainly gives us some clear thoughts on the matter.\nOur continuing coverage of this dynamic young lioness has foretold of a movement led by Seraphina that’s crossing both generational and international boundaries. Her pull on listeners appears to be her “Old Soul” perspectives as she crafts music some may say should be well beyond her years. Needless to say, we’re not surprised at this wave.\nSerphina’s arrival isn’t by happenstance , it’s been crafted! Starting at the prestigious Chicago Academy for the Arts, where she honed her skills in acting, dance, and vocal performance. This rigorous training has shaped her into a dynamic performer, with her talents extending into modeling engagements as well. At just a teenager, she has already made a significant impact in 2024 including getting a synch placement with EA Sports alongside iconic Chicago collaborator Twista when their song “Nothing” got picked up for the new Madden game AND, her video “You’re The One To Blame”, got selected for rotation on MTV’s “Brand Spanking New” show, airing in the US, Latin America, and Mexico.\nWe’ve said it before but it bears repeating , “Seraphina’s journey from the underground music scene of Chicago to global recognition is a testament to her talent and hard work. As she continues to break barriers and set new benchmarks, the industry watches closely. With her current trajectory, Seraphina is poised to become a major player in the music world, bringing fresh energy and a unique sound that resonates across demographics. Keep an eye on this rising star; she’s just getting started. Join the conversation on TikTok @seraphina.sanan ”",

    "text": "LANDOVER, Md., January 5, 2024 – The Washington Commanders teamed up with Kia and Operation Homefront during the team's Salute to Service month to gift Maryland-based Marine Corps veterans Tiffany and Dwight McKinney a new gray 2024 Kia Telluride X-Pro SUV. The car giveaway was made possible through the Commanders partnership with Kia and Operation Homefront, a national nonprofit serving America's military families through relief and recurring support programs. \"The Commanders are proud to support our local veterans and their families,\" said Commanders President Jason Wright. \"Partnering with Kia and Operation Homefront allows us to deepen our commitment to honoring people, like the McKinneys, who so bravely served our country.\" Sgt. Tiffany McKinney enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2006, where she served eight years before receiving an honorable discharge in 2014. Cpl. Dwight McKinney enlisted in the Marine Corps in early 2001 and received an honorable discharge in 2005. \"It is an honor for Kia to provide a Telluride X-Pro SUV to the McKinney family and celebrate Tiffany and Dwight's willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good,\" said Eric Watson, vice president, sales operations, Kia America. \"Operation Homefront helps military families address critical financial shortfalls and Kia recognizes the importance of this work and its positive impact on veterans who served our country.\" The Kia car giveaway was part of the Commanders 2023 Salute to Service programming, which honored local veterans and active-duty military members across a series of special programming throughout the month of November, including a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a Pack4Troops care packing event with USO, and a Salute to Service Youth Football Clinic at Fort Belvoir. Kia and Operation Homefront joined forces with Washington Salute, the official military appreciation club of the team, to expand opportunities to honor members of the DMV military community. \"Operation Homefront is proud to partner with Kia and the Washington Commanders to honor and support our nation's heroes,\" said Jill Eskin-Smith, Vice President of Corporate & Foundation Partnerships, Operation Homefront. \"Together, we are driving meaningful change and delivering the keys to new opportunities for the McKinneys and the military families that we serve.\" The McKinney family was awarded the keys to their new Telluride on the field during the team's Salute to Service-themed game and picked up the vehicle in December. Kia covered the cost of the taxes of the car and the family was also gifted a framed photo of the Kia workers who assembled the car. The Commanders' November 19 home game against the Giants was the first NFL game the McKinneys had the opportunity to attend as a family.",

Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: „Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.“\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert.",
