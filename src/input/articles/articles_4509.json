    "text": "Ultra-Orthodox Jews protest against Israel’s military service ruling Protesters sat on the main road and lay on the ground as police lifted them up and dragged them away. Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men blocked a major road in central Israel for two hours on Thursday to protest against a recent Supreme Court decision ordering young religious men to enlist for military service. Military service is compulsory for most Jewish men and women in Israel. But politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties have won draft exemptions for their followers that allow them instead to study in religious seminaries. This long-standing arrangement has bred widespread resentment among the broader public — a sentiment that has grown stronger during the eight-month war against Hamas in Gaza. More than 600 soldiers have been killed, and tens of thousands of reservists have been called up. Protesters sat on the main road and lay on the ground as police lifted them up and dragged them away. Officers mounted on horseback charged into the crowd. Many demonstrators held signs and chanted “To prison! Not to the army!” “We all came here for one goal, we reflect the position of all the Orthodox public,” said a young man, identifying himself only by his first name Ozer. “All the Orthodox public prefers to go to prison and not to the army.” The ultra-Orthodox see their full-time religious study as their part in protecting the state. Many fear that greater contact with secular society through the military will distance adherents from strict observance of the faith. The Supreme Court this week ordered the government to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men, saying the system of exemptions is unequal. The decision could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Ultra-Orthodox parties and their followers oppose any change in the system. The ultra-Orthodox make up roughly 13% of Israel’s population. But under the country’s fragmented political system, they wield significant political power and often serve as political kingmakers. The parties are key members of Mr Netanyahu’s governing coalition and could potentially force new elections if they decide to leave the government. Ultra-Orthodox leaders have not yet said whether they will quit the government, but their followers have scheduled a large protest in Jerusalem on Sunday.",

    "title": "Spacesuits of Boeing-launched astronauts stranded on space station are incompatible with SpaceX craft",
    "text": "Two astronauts stranded at the International Space Station after their Boeing spacecraft malfunctioned could be there much longer than anticipated because of an incompatibility with their spacesuits. NASA told Fox News Digital their Boeing spacesuits are made to work with the company’s spacecraft, while SpaceX’s spacesuits are made to work with its own Dragon vessel, which NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may ride in on their descent back to Earth. The two astronauts arrived in the Starliner vehicle June 5 and were only supposed to stay until the middle of the month. Authorities have been discussing how to safely return them home after discovering helium leaks and propulsion problems. NASA LEADERS PROVIDE UPDATE ON BOEING&#039;S STRANDED STARLINER ASTRONAUTS NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore aboard Starliner before launch June 5. Fox News Both astronauts are &quot;very familiar&quot; with the International Space Station, said Russ DeLoach, NASA’s chief of safety and mission assurance. The Starliner test flight marked the third mission to the ISS for each of them. With the commercialization of space, NASA is not as deeply involved as it once was with every aspect of mission and spacecraft design. As a result, an incompatibility between the spacesuits designed by SpaceX and Boeing has reportedly created an issue returning Wilmore and Williams to Earth. HOW BOEING STARLINER ASTRONAUTS STUCK IN SPACE COULD GET HOME AND WHEN A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying Boeing&#039;s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft launches from pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station for NASA&#039;s Boeing Crew Flight Test in Cape Canaveral, Fla., June 5. Getty Images &quot;The Boeing spacesuit is made to work with the Starliner spacecraft, and the SpaceX spacesuit is made to work with the Dragon spacecraft,&quot; NASA told Fox News Digital. &quot;Both were designed to fit each unique spacecraft.&quot; NASA did not confirm whether the issue is detrimental to the astronauts’ return. Fox News Digital has also reached out to Boeing on the matter. NASA-BOEING STARLINER LAUNCH WAS ‘SPECTACULAR,’ MISSION WENT AS PLANNED UNTIL DAY 2, ASTRONAUTS SAY NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore were the flight crew on Boeing&#039;s Starliner capsule, which is recovering from a series of issues. Fox News On Saturday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and agency leaders will hold an internal agency test flight readiness review in connection to the Boeing crew flight test. During the review, &quot;any formal dissents will be presented and reconciled,&quot; NASA said. After the test, NASA is expected to host a live news conference at 1 p.m. from Johnson Space Center in Houston. The decision to return the Starliner spacecraft to Earth with astronauts is expected to be made no earlier than Saturday. According to NASA’s website, if the decision is made to return Starliner to Earth without a crew, Wilmore and Williams will remain on the space station until late February 2025. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP NASA would then plan to have the SpaceX Crew-9 mission have only two crew members, instead of four, travel to the space station in September and Wilmore and Williams would return to earth with the two-person crew early next year. Fox News Digital’s Michael Ruiz contributed to this report. Original article source: Spacesuits of Boeing-launched astronauts stranded on space station are incompatible with SpaceX craft",

Lucknow: [UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath](https://www.thehansindia.com/home/tags/Yogi Adityanath), on Friday, welcomed the decision of the [Calcutta High Court](https://www.thehansindia.com/home/tags/Calcutta High Court) regarding OBC-Muslim reservation and emphasised that the Constitution never allows reservation based on religion. Speaking to the media at his official residence, he commented, \"The TMC government of West Bengal, driven by political appeasement, introduced this reservation in 2010 by forcibly including 118 Muslim castes into the OBC category. This approach of prioritising political interests over national welfare by the INDIA bloc must be denounced and exposed.\" He criticised the Mamata government for \"forcefully encroaching\" upon the rights of OBCs. \"The Court's reversal of the TMC government's unconstitutional action is a significant rebuke. Such unconstitutional acts cannot be tolerated. Dr BR Ambedkar reiterated this point numerous times in the Constituent Assembly.\" He explained that in India, reservation provisions were established for Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and after the Mandal Commission, the reservation was instituted for OBCs, taking into account their social and economic backwardness. \"The Constitution of India never allows reservation based on religion. Ambedkar had repeatedly warned that the country has several religions and we should not create any such situation that would push the country towards partition,\" the Chief Minister said. The chief minister emphasised that even in Karnataka, the Congress government has made similar \"encroachments\" on the rights of OBCs by providing reservations to Muslims. \"Similar actions have been taken in Andhra Pradesh as well. It is crucial to strongly oppose all such measures. Any unconstitutional act that threatens to divide India and weaken its foundation should not be accepted at all,\" he said. The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday cancelled all the Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates issued in West Bengal after 2010.",

    "text": "Nneka’s voice was the loudest in the area where she sat when the pastor instructed them to give a loud ‘Amen’. She alone knew exactly where she had been this past year, and how grateful she was to have come out of her dire circumstances.\nA few months prior to that time, Nneka had been on antidepressant medications prescribed after a diagnosis of clinical depression was made by the Consultant psychiatrist her family physician had referred her to. She hadn’t exactly expected it but there was overwhelming evidence that she needed treatment.\nWhat had started as a thrown ‘shade’ at a bridal shower had spiralled into a full-blown breakdown. At 35 years of age, she’d considered herself successful by every standard. She was the chief operating officer (COO) of a thriving fintech company, had just finished her 2nd Master’s degree from Harvard university and had great family relationships.\nTemi had been her roommate at university in England and was getting married. She’d been so excited when she heard the news as Temi was such an amazing person. She was even more excited to learn that Kayode was the lucky groom-to-be because he was one of those guys who had zero stress.\nOn the day of the shower, Nneka actually took a casual leave from work to avoid any Lagos traffic shenanigans. Her aso-ebi was on-point, her dressmaker had behaved herself thankfully and she gleefully made her way into the calm and serene beach they had chosen for the shower.\nThe event had gone on pleasantly until Naomi stood up to make a speech, in which she thanked God for Temi’s wedding before proceeding to mention all the other upcoming ladies whose weddings were lined up. She then concluded by thanking God that at least, they were not like those who were married to their career and had no hope of getting married.\nAn uneasy silence had enveloped the gathering as everyone there knew that Naomi was referring to Nneka, who’d had the most meteoric career rise amongst all of them and was the only one whose wedding wasn’t lined up. It had taken her love for Temi and her very strong emotional intelligence for Nneka not to walk out of the bridal shower.\nAs soon as she got home, the sobbing started. Her single status had made her the subject of ridicule several times and she had been told on a few occasions that without a man, her career success was useless. Naomi’s shade at the shower seemed to be the last drop that made her cup tip over.\nOver the next couple of months, Nneka’s attention was focused solely on all the weddings that were taking place amongst her female friends. She attended all the showers and all the wedding ceremonies and each time, she came away feeling sadder than the previous time. She followed them on social media and the feelings of inadequacy increased. The ‘peppering’ during Valentine’s and Christmas days was terrible.\nThe more she immersed herself in other peoples’ blessings, the more she lost sight of hers. Her mental health deteriorated until her boss at work noticed and mandated her to see the company physician who referred her to the psychiatrist.\nOne of the things she was asked to do was keep a daily gratitude journal for her own life and take her eyes completely off other people’s lives. She was to do this alongside her medication. Nneka went a step further by taking a social media break for 6 months and staying present in her own life.\nShe hadn’t kept the gratitude journal for up to 2 months when she realised how incredibly blessed she was. It was an immense blessing to just be herself, being comfortable in her own skin, and doing what fulfilled her. She realised how very fulfilling her career was and how much favour she had enjoyed.\nThe more she counted her blessings, the more her moods and productivity improved and soon she was totally off the antidepressant drugs, eventually fully regaining her health back. As we round off 2023, resist the urge to compare your progress with that of others. Rather, count your own blessings and watch your joy soar.",

    "text": "[HackerRuso](/user/HackerRuso)a [ambito.com](/go/link/3916814) [#1](c1#c-1) Realista diría.\nUcrania no tiene posibilidad alguna de ganar la guerra, es como si España entrara en guerra con USA, más vale una retirada a tiempo a que siga muriendo gente.\n[#31](c31#c-31) Solo por recordar, a Ucrania no le queda un solo barco de guerra, Rusia tiene todos los que estan fuera del mar Negro operativos y en el Mar negro 2/3 de la flota original...\n[#29](c29#c-29) Ya, desde tu cómodo teclado es muy fácil hablar de honor. ¿Quieres ir voluntario a la guerra a defender el honor de los ucranianos?\n[#10](c10#c-10) Palestina no tiene ninguna posibilidad de ganar a Israel, ¿entonces es mejor que se dejen matar como ratas?\nDejemos que los ucranianos decidan libremente su futuro en las próximas elecciones...\nAh! No! Que tienen prohibida a la oposición y encarcelados (los que no han sido asesinados) a los disidentes. Y el país tan endeudado que no pueden hacer otra cosa que no sea lo que le digan sus dueños extranjeros. Eso sin contar con el tema de la corrupción endémica que compra voluntades en muchos casos para poder sobrevivir.\nSi se hubiera dedicado a lo que prometió cuando lo eligieron: acabar con la guerra civil y conseguir la reconciliación nacional. Pero se dejó engañar por los cantos de sirena y ahora va camino de ser otro Sadam Hussein engañado por el Imperio, aunque aún está a tiempo de terminar como otro Guaidó refugiado.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Hay partidos opositores en el parlamento ucraniano.\nAhora moverás la portería a que no son opositores de verdad.\n[#12](c12#c-12) No se que te metes pero si crees lo que dices sabes que esa tumba va a ser a costa de muchas muertes o algo peor en todo Europa.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Ucrania no se puede permitir perder porque si lo hace, se convertira en un títere de Rusia o Rusia volverá a invadirla más adelante para seguir robando territorio. Las declaraciones de algunos dirigentes europeos como Macron pueden darnos pistas...\n[#12](c12#c-12) También lo hace. Pero les gusta más este titular.\nPor contra, su homólogo ortodoxo se dedica a bendecir tanques y dar medallas a los soldados\n[#3](c3#c-3) \"O sea, que le entregue territorio a Rusia\"\nNo ha de entregar nada, ese territorio ya lo tiene Rusia.\nEs mas, hay quien opina que ese territorio, ya es Rusia\n[#7](c7#c-7) Sí, lo opina putin y una cohorte de desnortados en MNM. Porque entonces alguno podría decir que \"Es más, hay quien opina que ese territorio, ya es Israel\" y echarnos unas risas.\nBueno, pues si lo dice el Papa, habrá que hacerle caso, no? Que le pida a Putin tener el coraje de reconocer que la ha liado y se retire fuera de Ukrania.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Hasta que no acabe la guerra sigue siendo Ucrania. Luego, dependerá de como se firme la paz... una paz que tendrá que llegar algún día.\n[#44](c44#c-44) Realmente no es asi, un territorio le pertenece de facto a quien puede ejercer la soberania sobre el, ahora mismo Crimea es Rusia porque Rusia ejercer la soberania sobre ella.\nLuego esta el reconocimiento internacional, que es otra otra, por ejemplo Kosovo para algunos paises sigue siendo parte de Serbia y para otros es un estado independiente, pero de facto, como comentaba antes, es un estado independiente.\nNormalmente cuando se termina una guerra y se firma la paz eso da pie a que el resto de paises acepten, o no, pero normalmente si, lo que se haya firmado y reconozcan las nuevas fronteras.\n[#7](c7#c-7) bueno siguiendo esta logica. En Cisjordania, ese territorio ya es de Israel de facto. Que los palestinos firmen la paz y listo.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Posiblemente en una negociación sensata incluso recupere algo del territorio que ya tiene perdido.\n[#3](c3#c-3) No se trata de que entregue o no territorio, se trata de que las guerras se pierden o se ganan, y cuando una guerra está perdida y los mandos siguen enviando a sus soldados (reclutados en gran porcentaje a la fuerza) a la muerte, se considera un crimen de guerra. Ucrania tiene perdida la guerra hace mucho tiempo. Si siguen con la guerra, lo único que queda es que una de dos, o bien suceda eso de hasta el último hombre o que nos envíen al resto de cabeza a una guerra que nada tiene que ver con nosotros.\n\"[...] Cuando ves que estás derrotado, que las cosas no van, necesitas tener el coraje de negociar”. Supongo que el Papa estará informado de la situación sobre el terreno como para decir eso.\n[#4](c4#c-4) ¿Tú en serio crees que puede? ¿ Puede el sahara español decidir su futuro ? pues no, y lo sabes. ¿Pueden los gazatíes decidir su futuro? pues tampoco, y lo sabes, y así hasta el infinito. ¿Puede el Nepal decidir su futuro si a China se le pone entre ceja y ceja la idea de asaltarla? pues tampoco, podríamos seguir contínuamente. Sólo te salvas si tienes al \"primo de zumosol\" que te apoya o bien formas parte de algo más grande como la otan, pero en caso contrario lo tienes clarinete, pero vamos, que esto habrá sido así desde que el mundo es mundo, ¿Puede un conejo decidir su futuro si un depredador ya lo ha atrapado? no se.. es lo mismo. Al margen de si está bien o está mal, el mundo no va de eso.\n[#27](c27#c-27) Palestina no está en guerra. Lo que se está cometiendo allí es un genocidio. La comparación es repugnante.\n[#35](c35#c-35) Lo repugnante es pensar que el agresor no es el culpable.\nEl argumento de los que defienden el genocidio israelí es el mismo, que los culpables son los palestinos y son ellos lo que tienen que rendirse. Algunos usan el mismo argumento en el tema de la invasión rusa a Ucrania.\nYo veo a ambos repugnantes.\nQue hubieran invertido en armamento en su momento o integrado en la OTAN. Ahora a ceder en lo que pida Rusia.",

    "text": "ASHEVILLE, N.C. ( WHNS /Gray News) – A junkyard employee in North Carolina saved a cat from a car about to be crushed.\nAccording to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, an employee at the junkyard was removing the car’s battery “just moments” before it was sent to be crushed.\n“As he popped open the hood, a bundle of fur jumped out and took a blind leap of faith into his arms,” Brother Wolf Animal Rescue wrote in a Facebook post . “She looked at him with soft eyes, thanking him with slow blinks and soft purrs. It was almost like she knew that her life had been saved.”\nThe employee kept the cat bundled in his jacket for the rest of his shift before turning it over to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, where his girlfriend works.\nA man called the junkyard very soon after, searching frantically for his cat.\nHe described his cat, Lilly, as very adventurous, who loves riding in the car or on his motorcycle with him. She even has her own helmet.\nBrother Wolf Animal Rescue confirmed Lilly was the cat that the junkyard employee had rescued.\nThe shelter offered to return Lilly to her owner vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed at no cost. He gladly accepted the offer.\nLilly and her owner were reunited and very happy to see each other.\n“She melted into his arms as his eyes filled with tears of joy,” the shelter wrote in a Facebook post.\nCopyright 2024 WHNS via Gray Media Group, Inc.
