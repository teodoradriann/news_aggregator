    "title": "After 25 years of juggling domestic duties with a dazzling career as a bestselling novelist, LOUISE DOUGHTY yearned for an escape. Here, in a brutally honest account, she reveals... Why I ran away from home at 60 ...and you should too!",
    "text": "At the age of 60, Louise was ready to dream up the next chapter fo r herself READ MORE: Secret to beating temptation if you're doing Dry January? It's what you EAT... As revealed in a new book on banishing booze - by top nutritionist Dr BROOKE SCHELLER\nThree decades ago, I celebrated my 30th birthday in the time-honoured tradition of all young people who think they are an adult but have no real idea about life, duty or personal responsibility — I got smashed.\nIn fairness, I had quite a lot to get smashed about. I had spent the whole of my 20s in one seedy rental after another while I supported myself with part-time jobs and tried to be a writer. But a week before my 30th, I got my first book deal and, the day before, I got my first real job in journalism.\nI had always said I wanted to be a writer by the time I was 30 and I did it with 24 hours to spare.\nIf I had spent my 20s in poverty-stricken, yet hedonistic, self-indulgence, my 30s were a wake-up call.\nTwo years after that birthday party, while I was still single and living in a bedsit, I found myself pregnant with my first child.\nWhen she turned 60, best-selling British author Louise Doughty (pictured) craved an escape. Just weeks after her birthday, she found herself on the tiny island of Seraya Kecil in the middle of the Flores Sea, halfway between Bali and East Timor\nThe father and I moved in together six weeks before our baby was born, at a stage in our relationship when I was saying: ‘Do you, um, have sugar in coffee?’ Bit of a steep learning curve, the autumn of 1996.\nThat baby, Alice, is now 27 and lives in Berlin. Her sister, Mabel, is 22 and on the cusp of leaving home — and the man I got to know while we changed nappies together is 63 and staring at retirement.\nAnd me? Implausibly, I’m 60. How the hell has that happened?\nThis time I had a small celebratory gathering, immediate family and close friends who stayed over.\nYes, there was some champagne drunk — that’s one thing that improves with age, the quality of the booze — but post-menopause my tolerance for alcohol has nose-dived and just as enjoyable was the massive cooked breakfast I made for everyone the following day.\nI no longer live in a bedsit — I have my own house and am financially secure. In fact, I have all the things I’d craved three decades previously: a relationship that produced two beautiful children, a home and a successful career.\nBut in the weeks before that lovely gathering last September, as I contemplated entering my seventh decade, there was only one thing I wanted: to lose all those things, temporarily at least.\nThe foremost thought in my mind was escaping. Turning 60 for me meant looking back over what had been more than a quarter of a century of domesticity.\nLouise was delighted to be staying on her own in a bamboo hut on a beach where she spent hours just staring at the sea\nPre-pandemic, I had travelled for work quite often, but always rushing back home to be the full-time parent, my working day bracketed by the school-run and always at the mercy of children’s sick days or sports days.\nWhen we spent six months and an absolute fortune having a kitchen extension put in, it was me who was there every day, trying to write a novel while a burly builder stood in the doorway to my study clutching the mug of tea I had just made him and said: ‘So, Louise, then the wife says to me…\nThe lockdown years arrived at the end of 25 years of childrearing. While I was grateful not to be home-schooling, I had a partner and two adult daughters at home all day, expecting me to be at their disposal.\nI had a deep need to be alone after decades of domesticity Then, after a heavy bout of rain in the run-up to my big birthday, we discovered water running down two of the back bedroom walls and realised we would have to get builders in to strip the damp plaster back to brick and redecorate.\nAll I could think was: ‘Get me away from here!’ I’m a bestselling author renowned for her plot developments. It was time to dream up the next chapter for myself.\nNo doubt about it, I was ready for a few twists and turns. Like most of my books, my life was looking as though it would divide neatly into threes — youth, childrearing, and . . . then what?\nIf we say most lives have a beginning, middle and end, well that ‘end’ can now last three decades. That’s an awful lot of pages to fill just wrapping up a story.\nAn invitation to Indonesia, to the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival on Bali, came at precisely the right moment for me.\nOn her first morning, Louise snorkelled off the jetty, among clownfish, turtles and baby sharks. She felt complete and utter freedom from all responsibilities and duties\nMy family knew about the festival — but when I announced over the dinner table that maybe I would be going for a wee bit longer — a month, say? — it was followed by some fast talking about how much I would love any of them to join me but, really, the flights were just so expensive, and it’s three-quarters of the way to Australia, the jet lag is hideous…\nIn the run-up to my departure, I affected a weary air of ‘gosh, all that way, it’s going to be hard’.\nIn reality, though, I couldn’t wait.\nAnd so, just weeks after my birthday, as the clocks changed in the UK and the country tipped head first into winter, I found myself, with my work duties concluded, on the tiny island of Seraya Kecil in the middle of the Flores Sea, halfway between Bali and East Timor, staying on my own in a bamboo hut on a beach and doing a lot — and I mean a lot — of just staring at the sea.\nOn my first morning, I snorkelled off the jetty, among clownfish, turtles and baby sharks. The feeling of complete and utter freedom from all duties and responsibilities was total. I had literally nothing to do but please myself.\nOver the next few days, I discovered that I could take day trips to Pink Beach — yes, it is actually pink — and the Komodo National Park, where Komodo dragons stalk a scrubby forest, hiding by waterholes to attack unsuspecting deer and water buffalo.\nOn a trek, I stuck close to the local guide, who carried what looked like a worryingly fragile stick.\nIf all this makes me sound adventurous then it’s important to say that I’m not. I’m a weak swimmer, I spook easily and I don’t like insects, particularly not the bitey ones.\nLouise found joy in swimming, sunsets and the perfectly judged solo cocktail where the staff place a tiny red chilli in your margarita and you get to enjoy its salty perfection\nOn my second night, I returned from the restaurant and exited my hut by the back door, where there was an outside shower and loo, to find a large brown rat sitting on the edge of the sink, cleaning itself.\nI had two questions for it: what is the meaning of life and what the hell are you doing in my bathroom? The rat paused and looked at me with an expression that seemed to say: ‘Search me, Louise, you’re the one who ran away. I live here.’\nThe rat visited me every night from then on, and I took to brushing my teeth in the restaurant toilets before retiring.\nIt helps if you don’t want to indulge in a sexual affair – avoid the cliché of a holiday fling and find joy in solitude When I mentioned the rodent to the staff, they were mildly amused, in the same way I might be if a visitor to the UK complained about the fox that comes into my urban garden.\nMy hut backed directly on to the jungle, they said, smiling — of course there was a rat.\nThey indulged me, though — Indonesian people are the most friendly and hospitable in the world — and the next night, I fell asleep to the acrid smell of burning from behind my hut as they smoked it out.\nSince I was sleeping in a hut made of wood and bamboo, this was not entirely reassuring.\nIt worked, though, and the next night, rattus rattus was no longer there. I found myself rather missing the little fella. It was his jungle, after all, his island. And what was I doing there, exactly?\nWhen she was researching her latest novel, A Bird In Winter, Louise went on the run herself, following the main character’s route through the Inner Hebrides, the Highlands and Orkney\nWhen it comes to Great Escapes, I have some form. My most recent novel, A Bird In Winter, is about a spy who uncovers a web of corruption and has to go on the run in Scotland, Norway and Iceland.\nTo research my book, I went on the run myself, following the main character’s route through the Inner Hebrides, the Highlands, Orkney… telling everyone that it was just a research trip but loving every minute.\nBeing a writer is a great cover story for escaping, but you certainly don’t have to be a writer to get to 60 and realise you are on the precipice of your Third Act.\nIn the near future, it is distinctly possible I may be blessed with grandchildren or struck down by ill health, or both — but at the age of 60 it feels as though there is a finite and precious window, when the responsibilities of middle age have receded but the predations of old age are not yet in view.\nIf you’re lucky enough to be financially stable, it seems little short of criminal not to make the most of that window.\nIt isn’t straightforward, though. When Elizabeth Gilbert of Eat, Pray, Love fame ran away from New York to find herself in Italy, India and Bali, she was single, in her 30s and in the wake of a divorce. She had little to lose. There’s a world of difference between running away at 30 and at 60.\nAt 60, you not only have responsibilities back home, you are wondering if old age will bring infirmity or loneliness, and the hardships of backpacking hold little allure.\nWhy explode a comfortable life when really what you want is a break from it — isn’t there a way of having the best of both worlds?\nTravelling alone, Louise noticed the glances from younger women dealing with kids and a spouse were more envious than pitying\nWell, yes, but you need an understanding partner, children who hold off having your grandchildren while you go off to find yourself – and, crucially, the economic resources to do it in comfort. (Yes, I do know how lucky I am.)\nThis is surely the great dilemma for any 60-something: how to have the great adventure without taking a baseball bat to the rest of your life.\nIt helps if you don’t want to have sex with other people. If I had one piece of advice for anyone thinking of doing it, that would be to avoid the cliché of an affair.\nMy Third Act is just starting and I plan to escape as much as I can Instead, find joy in swimming or sunsets, or the perfectly judged solo cocktail where the staff place a tiny red chilli in your margarita and you get to enjoy its salty perfection while quietly observing the couple on the next table who are clearly furious with one other.\nI’ve never felt more comfortable in my own skin than I do now, but given the choice between a night of wild passion and a good night’s sleep with no one snoring in my ear, the sleep wins every time.\nOn my remote island, there were a couple of families with older children, weary parents dealing with boisterous boys who wanted to go snorkelling or grumpy teenagers.\nI got some curious looks in the restaurant: but the glances from the younger women dealing with three kids and a truculent spouse were more envious than pitying.\nAs I sat in perfect peace with a book, idly contemplating the menu, I found I felt not one shred of nostalgia for those days.\nPictured: Louise and her family. Her husband is 63 while her daughters, Alice and Mabel, are 27 and 22\nThere are endless articles about empty-nest syndrome, or our fears about ageing — far fewer about a woman’s deep and abiding need for solitude that comes after decades of family life. It’s a passionate desire that has nothing to do with sex.\nAs I drifted off beneath my mosquito net on Seraya Kecil, a white T-shirt on my tanned skin, I realised I was enjoying living the full Cadbury’s Flake advert fantasy quite enough on my own, with no desire to roll over into a lover’s arms.\nWhat a relief to be free of the endless obsession with romantic love that still seems to be a young person’s lot. Give me a good book and a sun lounger any day.\nI didn’t speak to my family while I was away; just the occasional WhatsApp to make sure they were OK, the cats were still alive and the house hadn’t fallen down.\nAnd on my last day on Seraya Kecil, I woke before dawn and went to the end of the jetty. The fierce, glorious ball of sun rose and the world was full of possibilities. I cried a little, out of sheer joy: I was looking forward to going home.\nMy Third Act was just beginning. As long as my health and my finances hold out, I plan to escape as much as I can.\nWhat an exciting thought.\nLouise’s most recent novel, A Bird In Winter, is published by Faber & Faber.",

    "text": "A “ideia” de soft skills é um problema e devia desaparecer (sim, leu bem). Especialista explica porquê e dá a solução Por Human Resources Em 10:40, 29 Nov, 2024 Imagine que as melhores universidades, fundações e centros de investigação do mundo se reuniam para descobrir o que faz exactamente uma pessoa ter sucesso no trabalho. Suponha que descobriam que há dois conjuntos de competências complementares, um responsável por cerca de 15% da capacidade de sucesso no trabalho e o outro pelos restantes 85%. Que conjunto de competências seria considerado mais importante?\nPode parecer uma pergunta óbvia, mas não é. Como a investigação mencionada mostra, ainda nos referimos ao conjunto de competências menos impactantes como “hard skills”. Estas incluem o conhecimento técnico e o domínio de ferramentas e plataformas da área. O outro conjunto de competências, que na verdade é mais importante, é muitas vezes chamado de “soft skills”. «O que é uma pena… e um problema».\nNacho De Marco, co-fundador e CEO da BairesDev, sugere, de agora em diante, chamar-lhes skills sem quaisquer qualificadores. Quais são, então, os principais componentes a considerar na avaliação de um candidato?\nEsqueça o conhecimento e procure experiência\nPara compreender este ponto-chave, consideremos dois advogados. Um deles passou no exame da Ordem com nota máxima, foi aluno brilhante e é um ás na legislação. O outro não é tão inteligente, mas tem 22 anos de experiência profissional. Quem preferiria num cenário de ida a tribunal?\nA resposta é clara. Quando a pressão aumenta e cada pequena decisão tem grandes consequências, deseja alguém que já tenha visto e feito tudo isto antes, saiba o que esperar e possa lidar com o stress. A experiência é um activo difícil de bater.\nSalte o curso; procure competência\nA educação é fundamental, mas um diploma universitário, mesmo de uma instituição de prestígio, reflecte apenas o domínio de um conjunto limitado de competências básicas. Na faculdade, aprende-se a fazer coisas específicas e é-se avaliado de acordo com o desempenho. E a capacidade de mudar de rumo? Isto requer adaptabilidade, uma mentalidade ampla e visão de futuro – qualidades dificilmente mensuráveis em testes de avaliação. À medida que a conversa sobre a integração destas métricas aumenta, ainda permanece falta de foco na avaliação de qualidades como ser um bom “jogador de equipa” ou ter competências eficazes de gestão do tempo.\nMuitos gestores contratam apenas licenciados, assumindo que os candidatos sem curso superior não possuem competências ou não são tão dignos. Esta visão está a mudar. As competências ensinadas na faculdade são importantes, mas se procura um bom candidato, preocupe-se menos com o diploma e mais com a capacidade de lidar com trabalho essencial, que muitas vezes depende de competências interpessoais não ensinadas nas universidades.\nFamiliarize-se com comportamentos-chave\nConsidere a diferença entre hard skills e soft skills. Existe forma de medir as primeiras, por que não desenvolver métricas fiáveis ​​para as segundas? Vemos as soft skills como qualidades intangíveis e os comportamentos-chave servem de referência para ajudar os gestores a determinar a competência nessas “soft skills”.\nAbrace a lógica e o raciocínio\nUm engenheiro foi a uma entrevista de emprego e esperava debater a sua formação e experiência, conta Nacho De Marco. «Em vez disso, o entrevistador perguntou: “Quantas moedas precisaria de empilhar para atingir o topo do Empire State Building?” O entrevistado ficou intrigado, imaginando como alguém poderia saber a resposta sem medir. Mas o entrevistador sabia exactamente o que estava a fazer.»\nO seu objectivo era avaliar uma competência fundamental: o pensamento lógico. «Em vez de uma resposta precisa, queria ver um candidato abordar o problema da seguinte forma: “O Empire State Building tem cerca de trezentos metros de altura. Cinco moedas correspondem a cerca de um centímetro, ou seja são 500 moedas por metro. Assim, seriam necessárias cerca de 150 mil moedas”.» A resposta pode não estar correcta, mas o processo de pensamento prova que uma pessoa pode libertar-se dos limites rígidos de uma disciplina específica e pensar em termos amplos e flexíveis.\nDomine o invisível – as competências sociais podem ser desenvolvidas\nMuitas pessoas acham que não é possível ensinar a ser um grande comunicador ou bom jogador de equipa. Mas pode. Claro que alguns podem ter uma vantagem natural, mas há investigação concreta que prova que as competências interpessoais podem ser desenvolvidas e dominadas.\nHá um senão: ao contrário das competências técnicas, que muitas vezes se aprendem rapidamente e por conta própria, as soft skills dependem da situação e não podem ser dominadas apenas através de software de formação ou manuais de instrução. Os empregadores têm de priorizar a formação de soft skills, modelando as interacções que os colaboradores provavelmente encontrarão e orientando-os nos momentos-chave.\nEm suma, em vez de falar de soft skills, é melhor reforçar o que realmente faz alguém ter sucesso num mundo cada vez mais exigente, complexo e em constante evolução.\nLer Mais\nPartilha",

Only 40% of the prospective mineralized unit has been prospected by the Company.\nSystematic Approach. The initial program has assisted in prioritizing the main targets for advanced exploration given that the mineralized unit has a surface expression of 50 km.\nDale Ginn, President and CEO of Badlands, commented, \" The initial success of the 2023 Field Program gives confidence of the gold prospectivity in the Black Hills. Historically, the Company's focus was drilling deep extensions of the Standby Mine, but these samples reinforce the high-grade gold potential at surface. Badlands will continue to advance the near surface targets through exploration efforts of the team .\"\nFigure 1 .

The project shares striking similarities to the Homestake Mine which is located 30 km to the north. At both locations, the gold is concentrated in the local iron formation, particularly where it is has been thickened by regional folding. The iron formation at the two locations has been noted to be stratigraphically distinct but nearly identical in composition.\nBadlands collected a total of 420 rock samples to investigate prospective areas identified from Lidar and historical data. Results have highlighted five trends which the Company plans to follow up on with systematic surface sampling and possible drill targeting. These trends have been named Lookout, Standard, Cochrane, King of West, and Montezuma.\nLookout Trend\nThe Lookout trend extends 2.5 km southeast from the historic Standby Mine. The majority of samples were collected from the altered, sheered, and folded Rochford iron formation which locally encompasses the Nahant Schist and Rapid Creek Greenstone. Grab sample highlights include 19.2 g/t Au, 18.95 g/t Au, and 17.7 g/t Au.\nFigure 2 .

    "title": "La solution à la pollution atmosphérique en Iran",
    "text": "Ces dernières années, la pollution de l’air en Iran a atteint des niveaux alarmants, représentant une menace importante pour la santé de ses citoyens. Ce problème est devenu si grave que les écoles sont contraintes de fermer presque un jour par semaine en raison de la pollution de l’air. Le service météorologique déclare systématiquement que l’air de Téhéran est l’un des plus pollués au monde, même en hiver, qui devrait traditionnellement avoir un air plus pur que les autres saisons. Il est choquant de constater que la pollution de l’air est désormais devenue la troisième cause de décès en Iran. L’indice de qualité de l’air (IQA), qui classe la qualité de l’air en cinq niveaux, constitue une mesure cruciale. Allant de 0 à 500, les divisions comprennent : 0-50 (Bon), 51-100 (Modéré), 101-150 (Malsain pour les groupes sensibles), 151-200 (Malsain pour tout le monde), 201-300 (Très malsain) et 301-500 (Dangereux). L’analyse de l’IQA de Téhéran au cours de la dernière décennie révèle que seulement 150 jours ont eu une « bonne » qualité de l’air, soit une moyenne de 15 jours par an. L’année dernière, il n’y a eu que trois jours où la qualité de l’air était « bonne ». Actuellement, les écoles de Téhéran et d’autres villes ferment fréquemment en raison de la pollution de l’air, ce qui incite les autorités météorologiques à conseiller aux groupes sensibles de rester à l’intérieur. La qualité de l’air est mesurée par deux catégories de particules : les PM2,5 (particules d’un diamètre inférieur à 2,5 micromètres) et les PM10 (particules d’un diamètre compris entre 2,5 et 10 micromètres). Les particules PM2,5, provenant principalement de la combustion de combustibles fossiles par des véhicules obsolètes, contribuent de manière significative à la pollution de Téhéran. L’utilisation d’essence et de diesel de qualité inférieure, contenant des niveaux élevés de plomb, aggrave encore le problème. Un document classifié du ministère du Pétrole du régime révèle que, pour faire face à la pénurie quotidienne d’essence, le pays incorpore plus de quatre millions de litres de matières provenant d’usines pétrochimiques dans l’essence raffinée produite dans ses raffineries. De plus, une substance dangereuse et cancérigène connue sous le nom de « MTBE » (Méthyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) est mélangée quotidiennement à de l’essence de qualité inférieure en quantités supérieures à deux millions de litres pour améliorer sa combustibilité. Ces pratiques constituent des facteurs importants contribuant au risque de maladies graves. Notamment, les talibans ont récemment refusé les exportations de plus de 70 pétroliers iraniens, invoquant des inquiétudes liées à ces pratiques, et ont interdit leur entrée en Afghanistan. La situation en Iran en matière de pollution atmosphérique est profondément préoccupante, principalement en raison de l’utilisation du combustible Mazut dans les centrales électriques et diverses installations, ainsi que de l’incinération des déchets, en particulier des matériaux à base de pétrole comme les plastiques et le caoutchouc. Ces pratiques contribuent de manière significative à la production de particules nocives PM2,5. De plus, les particules PM10, provenant de la poussière et de la combustion du bois et de la végétation, aggravent le problème, notamment dans les villes. Le ministère de la Santé fait état de plus de 26 000 décès attribués à la pollution de l’air au cours de l’année écoulée, Téhéran représentant à lui seul plus de 6 000 de ces décès. Ces décès entraînent des coûts économiques estimés à 11 milliards de dollars, notamment une perte de revenus, des dépenses de santé et d’autres facteurs connexes. Malgré l’impact négatif considérable, le gouvernement, qui n’est pas élu par le peuple mais nommé par le Guide suprême, donne la priorité aux politiques dictées par ce dernier plutôt qu’aux préoccupations de santé publique. Il est intéressant de noter que les recherches indiquent que les avantages de la réduction de la pollution atmosphérique dépassent de loin les coûts. Cependant, les dirigeants actuels, souvent composés d’individus associés à des activités criminelles, semblent indifférents à ces conclusions. La constitution du régime condamne les actions menaçant la santé publique, y compris la pollution de l’environnement, mais des entités comme les Gardiens de la révolution contribuent de manière significative à cette pollution sans rendre de comptes. De plus, bien que l’Iran possède d’abondantes réserves de gaz naturel, le combustible Mazut continue d’être utilisé dans les centrales électriques. Le surplus de Mazut pèse sur les raffineries, car il n’existe pas de demande mondiale et il est utilisé en Iran en raison de son prix abordable. L’affirmation du régime selon laquelle un carburant bon marché entraîne une augmentation de la consommation est une tactique visant à justifier la hausse des prix de l’essence et du diesel tout en rejetant la faute sur le public. La réalité indéniable est que lorsque le gouvernement est la principale source de pollution de l’air et de l’environnement et que les privilégiés peuvent se permettre de résider dans les régions les plus saines du pays, il n’y a guère d’incitation à résoudre ou à atténuer le problème, ce qui entraîne une dégradation continue chaque année. Par conséquent, si les Iraniens aspirent à respirer un air pur, ils doivent éliminer la principale source de pollution.",

The footage clearly showed them fleeing with the stolen motorcycle and valuables.\nIn the second video, the robbers, using the same stolen motorcycle, attempted to rob another man, Usman, who was walking with his sister. Usman resisted which led to a scuffle. The suspects opened fire, but Usman escaped unharmed.

    "title": "Teachers at Elite NYC School Blamed Jewish Parents for Hamas Tensions: Report | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "By Cathy Burke | Saturday, 25 May 2024 01:05 PM EDT Some faculty members at the elite private Collegiate School in Manhattan blamed \"wealthy and influential\" Jewish parents for tensions at the school after Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack, according to an internal report on antisemitism. Faculty, parents and students came close to \"one of the oldest and most pervasive antisemitic tropes,\" the May 17 report charged, the New York Post reports. The findings followed a November 2023 letter to head of school David Lourie and board of trustees president Jonathan Youngwood — signed by more than 100 Jewish parents — charging the school’s internal response to the Hamas attack \"did not meet the moment,\" the outlet reported. \"People have lost confidence, there is no morality clarity, there is a pervasive anger and it is all driven by an erosion of trust,\" one Jewish parent told the New York Post. The report also revealed two previously unknown antisemitic incidents involving faculty, including one that allegedly ended in middle school English teacher Dwayne Alexis being \"relieved of his teaching duties after presenting controversial lessons on the Middle East to his 7th-grade civics class and 6th-grade world history class.\" Alexis had accused Israel of \"committing genocide\" in the wake of the Hamas attacks, and allegedly forced students to watch context-less video of Israel’s defensive war in Gaza, two parents told the outlet. In a second case, two upper-school teachers \"were reprimanded\" after asking \"pressing questions\" of a speaker at a school Holocaust assembly, the outlet reported. \"There was a Holocaust survivor invited to speak at the school and a teacher took it upon herself to press him on a series of questions, one of which was could 'the swastika be a symbol of peace?'\" one parent told the New York Post. Alumni at Collegiate, one of the New York City’s most prestigious private schools, include actor David Duchovny, rapper Lil Mabu, Caroline Kennedy’s son Jack Schlossberg, and Cornelius Vanderbilt II. © 2024 Newsmax.
