    "text": "Jerome Robbins' Broadway Tony winner [Jason Alexander](https://www.playbill.com/person/jason-alexander-vault- 26044) will lead a new revival of [Fiddler on the Roof](https://www.playbill.com/production/fiddler-on-the-roof-imperial-theatre-vault- 6051) at California's La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts. Performances will run November 8–December 1 at the Los Angeles-area company, with opening night set for November 9. The production will reunite Seinfeld's Alexander, starring as Tevye, with his fellow Broadway [Merrily We Roll Along](https://www.playbill.com/production/merrily-we-roll-along-alvin-theatre-vault- 877) cast member [Lonny Price](https://www.playbill.com/person/lonny-price-vault- 19196), who is directing the new production. Lee Martino will choreograph. \"Fiddler on the Roof is one of the undeniable masterpieces of the American musical, and it has been a dream of mine to direct the show,\" says Price in a statement. \"And to think I get to work with my old friend Jason Alexander on this extraordinary piece really is a dream come true. I can think of no other actor more perfect to play Tevye, and I believe he will redefine the role (and the show) for a new generation!\" Adapted from the stories of [Sholom Aleichem](https://www.playbill.com/person/sholom-aleichem-vault- 13881), Fiddler on the Roof centers on Tevye the milkman as he attempts to maintain his Jewish traditions, challenged by new ideas from his five young daughters. The 1965 Best Musical Tony winner features a book by [Joseph Stein](https://www.playbill.com/person/joseph-stein-vault- 13511), music by [Jerry Bock](https://www.playbill.com/person/jerry-bock-vault- 4570), and lyrics by [Sheldon Harnick](https://www.playbill.com/person/sheldon-harnick-vault- 7340), with a score boasting such favorites as \"Tradition,\" \"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,\" \"If I Were a Rich Man,\" and \"Sunrise, Sunset.\" Further casting and creative team members are to be announced for the upcoming California production.

Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nA supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday.\nAround 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars.\nDamage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nScreengrab taken from PA Video of a damaged gate in Stalybridge after the Tameside tornado (Richard McCarthy/PA) ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day.\nIn Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.\n🌦️ Blustery showers are possible on Friday morning, with these most likely in the north and west. Many of us will also see some sunshine and some places may stay dry.\n🌬️ Still windy in northern England and later Shetland, with gales possible, but otherwise somewhat less windy. pic.twitter.com/hInP8LNF2c\n— Met Office (@metoffice) December 28, 2023\nFerry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel.\nAir travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.\nMet Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "Pennsylvania Republicans’ Disgusting Reaction to January 6 Officers\nHarry Dunn and Aquilino Gonell were booed by state lawmakers.\nTwo police officers who were injured by rioters during the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol were met with an appalling cacophony of boos and hisses from several Republicans during a visit to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Some lawmakers even stormed out of the hall.\nFormer U.S. Capitol Police Officer\nHarry Dunn and former Sergeant Aquilino Gonell had been touring through Pennsylvania as part of the President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, but according to The Washington Post, several so-called conservative state lawmakers just couldn’t handle their presence Wednesday and threw a complete tantrum.\nDunn, who was pepper-sprayed and injured in hand-to-hand combat during the insurrection, said it was “sad though unsurprising that [Donald] Trump’s allies in the Pennsylvania state House followed his lead in mocking the January 6 attack.”\n“The fact they’re scared to listen to those of us who were there and witnessed the political violence of January 6 first hand speaks volumes,” he said Thursday in a statement.\nGonnell, who was battered during the riot three years ago, wrote in a\npost on X that Pennsylvania House Republicans had “abandoned the truth” and “sided with those who attacked us.”\nPennsylvania Democrats rallied to the former officers’ defense. Representative Arvind Venkat told the Post that he was “shocked and appalled” to see eight to 10 of his Republican colleagues walk out as the two were announced. Representative Mike Schlossberg said that a majority of Republicans did not stand and applaud the two men, who were introduced as “heroes” by House speaker Joanna McClinton.\nMcClinton released a\nstatement about the incident, saying, “The GOP members’ shameful behavior was unbecoming of our institution for any guest, let alone two of the men responsible for defending our democracy during a dark day in our nation’s history.”\nRepresentative Jordan A. Harris, also a Democrat, criticized the Republican response to honoring members of law enforcement. “We talk about backing the blue, but people turned their backs on blue yesterday,” said Harris.\nBut Pennsylvania House Republican Leader Bryan Cutler hit back at the criticism from Democrats, accusing them of “antagonizing members and inviting division and discord for their political and campaign purposes.” He insisted that he had stayed on the floor.\nThe shocking incident is a sign of how divisive the January 6 insurrection is, with many Republicans continuing to\ninsist that rioters had not been in the wrong and that the 2020 election was rigged.",

    "text": "Cannabis legalization marks the dawn of easy access to regulated pot products. There are certain cities with a weed shop around every corner. With such readily available products, stocking up big until the next pickup is in the past for many. Still, there may be a time that someone is incentivized to buy an enormous amount of weed, or perhaps they found a forgotten jar in the back of the closet. In these cases, it may be time to figure out how to rehydrate old cannabis flower.\nSmoking or vaping old dry cannabis without rehydrating it is not ideal. When dry, cannabis buds can lead to harsh hits that cause coughing, sore throat, or even headaches. Dry weed will also tend to lose terpene content. As a result, the overly dry flower will not smell or taste as good as weed that’s been properly stored.\nRELATED: Cannabis mystery may be solved with lifestyle change\nLike terpenes, cannabinoids will alter over time. THC may degrade into CBN , a cannabinoid with a wildly different effect. Those hoping for the uplifting that once was may be met with a heavy, relaxing variety if the weed has aged. Be mindful of this when choosing to consume old cannabis.\nThe best way to avoid smoking dry weed is to store it correctly long term. Keep cannabis fresh by storing it in a mason jar with a humidity pack. There are also specialty stash containers designed for the job that works just as well as a glass jar. Skip plastic bags. Grab an airtight stash container.\nWhile these methods to store cannabis can keep cannabis fresh long term, sometimes it dries out. If it does, there are a few tried and true methods to rehydrate your weed.\nWhat to do when the weed is dry Weed gets dry sometimes. When it does, there are a few methods to get moisture levels back on track. These tricks will not add terpenes or cannabinoids back but could offset dry throat, coughing, and potential headaches.\nHumidity Packs Adding humidity control packs to a jar of weed can help keep it fresh and add moisture back in. These squishy packets can regulate the humidity of a closed container thanks to a mixture of salt and water inside. The mixture hardens once its capabilities hit capacity. Humidity packs can stabilize the environment inside a weed jar in one to seven days without adding unwanted flavor.\nFruit Peels Neighborhood dealers have used lemons, orange, and limes to rehydrate weed for generations. The method adds a scent and flavor to the bud along with moisture, which can be good or bad depending on who smokes it. Citrus peels work best, but the fruit peel method works with banana and apple peels, too. While this method can make cannabis moist enough to eat, keep track of the peels to avoid any moldy or otherwise gross fruit peels from touching flower.\nDamp paper towel A damp paper towel or cotton ball makes for an easy, low-cost way to rehydrate pot. While simple, it is also risky. Keep the cotton ball or paper towel in the jar for an hour or up to a day. However, do not let the wet items touch the weed, if possible, to avoid mold growth. Carefully monitor moisture levels while using this trick for the same reason.\nBread Moisture transfer also works between bread and cannabis. Rehydrate weed with a tortilla or slice of bread, just like a fruit peel. Simply throw it into the jar, monitor for mold, and let it ride. This method could work in a few hours. Be mindful to never use this trick when sharing with gluten-free friends.\nLettuce Greens like iceberg lettuce have a high moisture content that can be used to add moisture back to bud. Reports say this could bring the jar back to optimal humidity in two to three hours. Another draw is that lettuce does not add flavor and scent to bud like citrus peels. Take the greens out immediately after optimal moisture levels are achieved.\nRELATED: New cutting-edge marketplace speaks to unstoppable trend\nWhen not to smoke dry weed While it is possible to rehydrate weed, sometimes it is better to toss it. Old weed may develop mold or other issues that make it risky to consume. Properly storing your cannabis is only partly about keeping weed fresh. It can also help keep mold, bud rot, and other airborne pathogens at bay. Do not rehydrate and consume weed if there are any signs of bud rot, mold, or any other issues.\nFrequently asked questions about rehydrating cannabis There are many methods to rehydrate weed, and most of them include organic materials. This FAQ can help anyone with a jar of old, dry pot.\nCan you rehydrate old cannabis? Yes, it is possible to rehydrate old weed. There are many methods to add moisture back to cannabis flower, each with its own side effects on the bud.\nIs it safe to smoke old weed? Smoking anything is not necessarily safe, but in many cases smoking old weed is no more risky than freshly cured flower. Signs of mold, bud rot, or rancid smells indicate that pot should not be consumed.\nDo cannabis strains change over time? Terpenes and cannabinoids degrade or disappear altogether when the weed ages and dries out. This can alter how the cannabis smells, tastes, and its effects.\nHow to rehydrate old cannabis Storing cannabis is step one, but sometimes weed still dries out. When seeking out to rehydrate old cannabis, it is as easy as looking in the fruit bowl. Lettuce, citrus peels, bread, and even paper towels can make dry, harsh flower fresh again. Unfortunately, none of this will add cannabinoids or terps back, but the pot will be smokeable. Nobody wants to waste weed, and with these tips, they don’t have to.",
