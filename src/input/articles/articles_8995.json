    "text": "HealingUS Communities (833-300-4673) has announced an update to their Intensive Peer Recovery Program, a peer-run day program in Toms River designed to help individuals recovering from drug and alcohol addiction transition into sober living.\nFarmingdale, United States - April 4, 2024 —\nThe non-profit organization is now accepting applicants into the Intensive Peer Recovery Program (IPRP), which will take place over the course of four consecutive weeks. The program is open to patients coming out of clinical treatment and recovering individuals who feel that they are unable to remain sober.\nFor more information, please visit https://healingus.org/intensive-peer-recovery-program/\nPeer support provides numerous benefits to individuals suffering from substance use disorders, especially when delivered in tandem with clinical treatment. According to a scientific review in Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation, studies have shown that members of peer support groups experience increased self-esteem, positive feelings of accomplishment, and a heightened ability to cope with challenges.\nHealingUS Communities’ IPRP is a more intensive option compared to typical peer support groups and focuses on re-introducing members to a sober lifestyle. The end goal of the program is to empower participants with the means to achieve long-term abstinence by allowing them to connect with other members of HealingUS, which is recognized as one of the most successful recovery communities in Toms River.\nThroughout the program, members will have the opportunity to participate in individual and group skill sessions that are intended to help them transition into society. These sessions will be facilitated by trained Peers in Recovery, who will aid participants in gaining independence, regulating their emotions, and relearning life skills essential for the earliest stages of recovery. Because HealingUS Communities acknowledges there are many ways to recover from addiction, the IPRP will also teach members recovery skills through 12-step facilitation and specific programs such as Refuge Recovery, Recover 2.0, and SMART Recovery.\nTo keep track of their progress, clients will form a Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP), which they can discuss and revise through weekly meetings with recovery coaches. Those in need of additional clinical care and mental health services can also consult their peer case managers, who will provide them with the resources to secure the treatment they require.\nAbout HealingUS Communities\nHealingUS Communities is a New Jersey 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was founded in 2012 to fill the gaps in alcohol and drug addiction treatment. Their recovery programs have helped thousands of families to date.\nInterested parties can learn more by visiting https://healingus.org/\nContact Info:\nName: Ashley Regan\nEmail: Send Email\nOrganization: HealingUS Communities\nAddress: 260 Casino Drive, Farmingdale, NJ 07727, United States\nPhone: +1-866-798-3232\nWebsite: https://www.healingus.org\nSource: PressCable\nRelease ID: 89126292\nIn case of detection of errors, concerns, or irregularities in the content provided in this press release, or if there is a need for a press release takedown, we strongly encourage you to reach out promptly by contacting error@releasecontact.com .

    "text": "Travelers battle bad weather coast to coast on one of the busiest travel days of the year As the week between Christmas and New Year's Eve comes to a close, travel remains as busy as ever. With [several storm systems impacting the country](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/post-holiday-storms-will-create-travel-trouble-millions-rain-snow-icy-rcna131317) from coast to coast, [messy conditions ](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/blizzard-conditions-roll-northern-central-plains-snarling-post-christm-rcna131172)could lead to delays both on the roads and in the air. The storm system that brought record rainfall to places such as Philadelphia and Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Wednesday will continue up the coast into New England through the day Thursday. Steady rain and an isolated flooding risk will accompany this system as it treks into New England. On Thursday morning, 10 million people were under flood alerts. Even as rain mostly tapers off during the day Thursday, low clouds and lingering showers will continue to cause air delays for major hubs such as New York City and Boston. On Friday, as lingering moisture meets cold air across Maine, rain will change over to snow, creating the possibility of slick roadways. A separate storm system moving across the Florida Peninsula will bring morning rain to places such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale, before drying out by the evening commute. Meanwhile, the Midwest has its own share of inclement weather this week, with a mix of rain and snow forecast to impact much of the region Thursday. Temperatures hovering just above freezing will limit snow accumulations, but slushy roads and poor visibility could impact travel in the northern sections of Interstates 75 and 65. Chicago, Indianapolis and Milwaukee airports could all see flight delays Thursday as the system progresses east. The Ohio and the Tennessee valleys could also face a few snow showers Thursday night into Friday as the system continues south and east. Some flurries could even push as far south as the extreme northern parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. While no accumulation is expected here, novelty flakes could cause a stir for these southern spots. Another rainmaker of a storm will encompass almost the entire state of Florida on Thursday, bringing steady rainfall with widespread totals of up to an inch. Every Florida airport runs the risk of experiencing delays because of this soaker, with wet roadways likely to create headaches for those traveling. And the West Coast is bracing for torrential rains as another system makes its way inland Thursday into Friday. Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle are all looking at likely flight delays and almost the entire Interstate 5 corridor can expect a soaking by Friday afternoon with rainfall totals up to 3 inches possible. Those making travel plans should plan ahead and prepare accordingly as the last few days of December come to a dreary end.",

    "text": "Advertisement ‘Every day presents new challenges…I make a concerted effort to stay present’ [Sarah Finnan](https://www.image.ie/author/sfinnan) 19th Sep 2024 Recently listed as one of Reuters trailblazing women of 2024, Hazel Mitchell is the senior director of global customer service at eBay. Celebrating 20 years of the platform in Ireland this year, Hazel has been with the company since it launched in Dublin back in 2004. Here she shares more about her career journey to date. Did you always want to work in a customer experience role in a major global tech company? When starting out in college, working in the technology sector had not even crossed my mind, let alone in a customer experience role. In college, I studied… I started out studying law, definitely influenced by years of courtroom dramas on TV. My most formative work experience was… making the decision to move from studying law to working with Aer Lingus on their customer service team. It was my first real professional role, and I loved it. I was instantly part of a team with an incredible culture. There was a huge focus on development and leadership, and it really shaped the trajectory of my career and showed me the importance of culture in the workplace. My first real job was… with the team in Aer Lingus where I worked until 2004, moving my way from a role as a customer service rep right through to leadership positions with the contact centre. When eBay opened in Ireland in 2004, it was such an exciting opportunity to join a company with an amazing purpose and value, a fast-paced environment and a growing team. I initially joined as a team leader with a team of 40 people and instantly loved it. The most invaluable thing I learned early on in my career was… the power of showing up, it is all about attitude and being open to growth and learning. A common misconception about what I do is that… working in technology is all about the technology. While eBay is a technology company, it is also a company that connects people and all of my work is about people and ensuring that the buyers and sellers that we connect globally have the best experience. Do you have a career mentor or someone you look up to/seek advice from? Yes, I am incredibly grateful to be amongst those fortunate people who found leaders to follow who care about me and who took a chance on my emerging capabilities – none more so than my amazing leader Derek Allgood who I have worked with for almost seven years. He inspires me daily to try to be a better version of myself. The biggest risk I have taken in my career so far is… deciding to take the role leading the North American market in eBay, based out of Salt Lake City. The role started just as Covid emerged, so moving the family stateside was put on hold while I ran the North American market from my home office. It was a great learning experience and the risk paid off and has led to my role today leading the global teams. I wake each day at… just after 6.30am. I have been convinced by caring colleagues to ensure that health and wellness is part of my day in recent years, so I start each day with movement like an online class at home. This allows me to focus on myself, before getting started with the family and getting to spend some time with them before my girls head off to school. I travel to work by… car. I’m lucky to live close to the office and with flexibility and remote working as part of eBay, I can get my work day started at home, avoiding the school traffic before heading into the office. On an average workday I… am based in the office in Blanchardstown and try to make sure I am using this time for in-person meetings with colleagues. I always make sure to have lunch with colleagues in the office – we are lucky to have an incredible in-house catering team who create the most delicious healthy meals. I tend to ensure most of my 1:1 Zoom meetings are done when I am at home, allowing me to connect with our Asia, Pacific and North American teams. I start my working day at… straight after my kids have left for school. I appreciate the flexibility that remote work allows in deciding where to base myself from week to week. The first thing I do at work is… check in with my teams in Ireland and in other markets as they come online throughout the day. I usually spend the first portion of the day… doing 1:1 catch-ups across the teams, either online with global markets or in person with the team based in Ireland. I break for lunch at… around 1pm and always have lunch with the team in the office. It’s a great way to catch up with the people I work with. The most useful business tool I use every day is… Zoom. It is an invaluable tool to connect with colleagues all over the world. While I work in tech, I am a little old school, and you will always see me with a notepad and pen scribbling notes. I save time by… picking up the phone instead of sending an email. I rarely get through my working day without… learning something new or finding new ways to collaborate with colleagues. The best part of my day is… knowing that I am playing a meaningful role in delivering the future of the eBay company. The most challenging part of my day is… as with many professionals, every day presents new challenges. It’s always busy but I make a concerted effort to stay present and listen. I’m mindful of attending to the people in front of me and the importance of empathy and the language I use to communicate. I know it’s been a good day if… after 20 years working with eBay, I am constantly challenged and appreciate every day that challenges my assumptions. I usually end my day… each day is different but I love to get out in nature at the end of the day for a walk with my family for a proper switch off! Before I go to bed, I’ll… listen to an audiobook on development or leadership. I often prepare for tomorrow by… reviewing my priorities for the next day and having a clear sight of what needs to get done. After a long work week, I destress by… spending time with my family. A good walk outdoors does wonders for everyone. The accomplishment I’m most proud of is… introducing remote working to Ireland in 2017 in partnership with the IDA. To this day, it is core to how eBay works across Ireland with colleagues working in every single county across the country and we have since scaled this across the globe for our GCX teammates. If you want to get into my line of work, my advice is to… start with the customer, be open to opportunities, take the risk and be persistent! At the moment I’m working on… the future of customer experience at eBay and investing in AI as part of our continuous investment in innovation. Imagery courtesy of Hazel Mitchell.",

    "text": "Why this $1 massage offer is only valid for rich Chinese women?\nA massage parlour in Shenzhen, China, has gained attention for offering an 80-minute full-body detox massage for just 9 yuan (US$1).\nHowever, to qualify for the discounted service, clients must be women and meet at least one of 27 criteria, proving, they are “exceptionally outstanding,” as reported by the South China Morning Post.\nThe requirements include owning a luxury property, driving high-end cars such as Audi, Mercedes, or Porsche, using an iPhone 16 Pro Max, or possessing luxury bags.\nOther qualifying conditions include employment at leading tech companies like Tencent or Huawei, holding Hong Kong or Macau residency, or having traveled to Europe or the US.\nSocial media influencers with over 500,000 followers, brand founders, and professionals such as doctors and bankers are also eligible.\nA message from the parlour states, “If you do not meet the conditions, keep working hard in 2025!” It claims the purpose is not personal gratification but to encourage customers to strive for a better life.\nStaff confirmed to a mainland media outlet that customers must provide proof of meeting at least one requirement to receive the low-price massage.\nDespite the exclusivity, an anonymous customer noted that the service felt no different from a standard massage. More than 100 orders had been placed as of the latest update.\nThe parlour’s criteria have sparked controversy. Some critics argue that the restrictions could violate China’s Consumer Rights Protection Law, which guarantees fair trade for all consumers.\nOthers have questioned whether this is a marketing tactic targeting high-spending clients for potential upselling.\nExclusive customer identity requirements are not new in China. In August 2024, a swimming club in Jiangsu province only allowed women under 45 with “a high IQ and personal qualities” to join, a policy that also raised concerns about discrimination, according to the South China Morning Post.",
