    "text": "Sir David Attenborough portrait Sir David Attenborough will present a National Geographic documentary about the health of the world’s oceans. The naturalist and broadcaster, 98, is known for BBC documentaries including Wild Isles and the Planet Earth series, which has won Bafta TV Craft awards. In the new feature-length documentary special, which has the working title David Attenborough: Ocean, Sir David will expose the biggest problems facing our oceans during what he calls “the great age of ocean discovery”. Sir David said: “My lifetime has coincided with the great age of ocean discovery. Over the last hundred years, scientists and explorers have revealed remarkable new species, epic migrations and dazzling, complex ecosystems beyond anything I could have imagined as a young man Sir David Attenborough “Over the last hundred years, scientists and explorers have revealed remarkable new species, epic migrations and dazzling, complex ecosystems beyond anything I could have imagined as a young man. “In this film, we share those wonderful discoveries, uncover why our ocean is in such poor health and, perhaps most importantly, show how it can bounce back to life.” The special will show oceans across the Americas, Europe, Africa and Oceania and demonstrate the methods used to reverse harmful human activity along coral reefs, mangroves, coastal communities, fish farms, marine sanctuaries and other habitats. Tom McDonald, National Geographic’s executive vice president of global factual and unscripted content, said: “There is no-one better to deliver this landmark film than Sir David. “I have had the privilege and pleasure of working with him many times over the past decade, and so I am, of course, personally and professionally thrilled that he has agreed to work with National Geographic for the very first time on a subject that is timely and close to his heart.” The film will debut in cinemas in 2025 before premiering on National Geographic and streaming on Disney+.

    "title": "A Priest’s Kidnapping in South Sudan Heightens Fear Among Clergy in the Country",
    "text": "JUBA, South Sudan (RNS) — The recent mysterious disappearance of the Rev. Luke Yugue and his driver, Michael Gbeko, in South Sudan has left many Christians in the central African country worried about their safety and afraid to carry out ministry work across the troubled nation.\nThe two are believed to have been kidnapped by ethnic militia forces on April 27 while traveling by road on a motorbike from the Nagero Catholic parish to Tombura county in the state of Western Equatoria, bordering the Central African Republic and Congo.\nReligious leaders, especially those from the Catholic Church, have been urging congregants across the country of more than\n[12.7 million](//www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/south-sudan/) people, [about 61%](//www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/south-sudan) of them Christian, to pray for the safety of the missing priest and his driver. The leaders have also been desperately appealing to the government to aid in the release of the two, who are believed to be held hostage, and to declare a state of emergency in the region where the kidnapping occurred.\n“As a church, we appeal to Your Excellency to help us bring Fr. Luka and those with him alive,” Bishop Edward Hiiboro Kussala of South Sudan’s Catholic Diocese of Tombura-Yambio said in his April 29 letter to the country’s president, Salva Kiir, which the bishop shared with Religion News Service.\nThe country descended into civil war in December 2013, when Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar and 10 others of attempting a coup. Even though the conflict ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together, the country continues to see widespread fighting and kidnappings, especially in rural areas.\nBetween 2013 and 2018,\n[reports](//www.ushmm.org/genocide-prevention/countries/south-sudan/case-study) indicate, nearly 400,000 people were killed as a result of the civil war. The conflict also left over [4 million](//concernusa.org/news/south-sudan-crisis-explained/) South Sudanese displaced from their homes, with nearly 2.3 million fleeing to neighboring countries, including Uganda and Kenya.\nDozens of\nchurch leaders have been kidnapped or killed by government soldiers or rebels in the decade of fighting. The majority of them were kidnapped or killed while carrying out pastoral duties across the world’s youngest nation.\nEvangelist Mayol Kuot noted that the recent disappearance of religious leaders highlights the ongoing instability in the country and disrupts their ability to provide spiritual guidance, counseling, health care, education and other assistance to the populace, as well as care for orphans and children.\n“The recent kidnapping of the priest is shocking to us. It shows that the security situation in the country is not improving at all,” said Kuot, who ministers in Malakal, a town in northeastern South Sudan. “We are now afraid of going out in remote areas to preach the Word of God and serve vulnerable people who want our help as religious leaders.”\nKuot said he has had friends who were murdered or kidnapped by unknown gunmen in road ambushes and churches while ministering. This causes other clergy in the country to be “demoralized,” he said, and unable to continue working freely due to fear of attacks.\n“You can’t effectively work in such an environment when you are unsure if you will return home safe after ministering to people,” Kuot said. “We need protection from the government to continue ministering to the suffering people of South Sudan who have been displaced from their homes due to war.”",

    "title": "5 Sincere Love Songs Written by Late Edgy Rocker Lou Reed",
    "text": "This Saturday, March 2, marks what would’ve been\nLou Reed’s 82nd birthday. Reed, who died of liver disease in 2013 at age 71, was best known for his songs that delved into the dark and edgy corners of the New York scene, including tales of drug addiction, murder, cross-dressing, sadomasochism, prostitution and domestic abuse.\nHowever, Reed also had a soft side, and penned some truly beautiful and sincere paeans to love. Here is a look at five of Reed’s memorable romantic tunes.\n[[RELATED: Lou Reed’s Meditative Final Solo Album, Hudson River Wind Meditations, to Be Reissued]]https://americansongwriter.com/lou-reeds-meditative-final-solo-album-hudson-river-wind-meditations-to-be-reissued/\n“I’ll Be Your Mirror” – The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967)\n“I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a gentle poetic ballad from The Velvet Underground & Nico, the 1967 debut album by Reed’s influential art-rock band\nThe Velvet Underground. It’s one of three songs on the album sung by German chanteuse Nico.\nThe song was written for Nico by Reed. According to author Victor Bockris, it was inspired by a comment she made to him after a 1965 performance.\nThe opening lines of the song are, “I’ll be your mirror, reflect what you are / In case you don’t know / I’ll be the wind, the rain and the sunset / The light on your door, to show that you’re home.”\nAfter Nico’s departure from the group, Reed continued to sing the song in concert. He also played it live on and off throughout his long solo career.\n“I Found a Reason” (1970) – The Velvet Underground\n“I Found a Reason” was featured on The Velvet Underground’s fourth album, Loaded, Reed’s last with the band before launching his solo career. The doo-wop-influenced tune finds Reed professing his love for someone who has given him “a reason to keep livin’” and has given him hope for a better life in the future.\n“Perfect Day” (1972)\n“Perfect Day” is one of Reed’s best-known solo tunes. It appeared on his classic 1972 album Transformer. The album also featured his one-and-only U.S. chart hit, “Walk on the Wild Side.”\nThe song was inspired by a day that Reed and his fiancée, Bettye Kronstad (who later became his first wife), spent in Central Park. The tune’s melancholy verses lead into a soaring chorus in which Reed croons about the romantic day he spent with his love.\n“Perfect Day” found wide popularity after it was featured on the soundtrack to the 1990 dark comedy Trainspotting. A 1995 cover of song by Duran Duran peaked at No. 28 on the U.K. singles chart. An all-star remake of the tune that released as a charity single in 1997 spent three weeks at No. 1 in the U.K.\n“Heavenly Arms” (1982)\n“Heaven Arms” was featured on Reed’s critically acclaimed 1982 album The Blue Mask. The song features Reed declaring his deep love for his second wife, Sylvia Morales, a British designer whom he wed in 1980.\n“The Power of the Heart” (2008)\n“The Power of the Heart” was only released as part of a compilation titled Love by the Cartier Foundation. Reed wrote the song as a wedding gift to his third wife and widow, avant-garde musician Laurie Anderson.\nThe tune features understated acoustic guitar and strings, as Reed speak-sings lyrics expressing his deep love for Anderson.\nPeter Gabriel recorded a rendition of “The Power of the Heart” for his 2010 covers album Scratch My Back.\nAfter Reed’s death in 2013, Anderson was interviewed at a memorial gathering, and she cited “The Power of the Heart” as her favorite song by her late husband.",
