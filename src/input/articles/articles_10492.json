    "title": "Supreme Court Decision to Send Idaho Abortion Case Back to Lower Courts is a Reprieve but Leaves Patients and Clinicians at Risk: PHR",
    "text": "The Supreme Court’s [decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-726_6jgm.pdf) to avoid ruling on the conflict between Idaho’s extreme ban on access to abortion and a federal law guaranteeing access to abortions in cases of emergency provides a reprieve to pregnant patients in Idaho but leaves pregnant patients experiencing grave health risks and emergency room clinicians facing a medical ethics crisis in other states with similar bans, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) said today. The Supreme Court reversed its January 5 decision to allow Idaho to enforce its ban on access to abortion in emergency rooms and sent the case back to the District Court that had earlier stayed Idaho’s ban as contravening the federal statute EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) in Moyle v. United States. For the time being, pregnant patients in Idaho who need abortion services in emergency situations will be able to access care legally while the case proceeds. However, the Supreme Court did not affirm that hospitals are required to offer emergency abortion services to patients who need them and the reprieve may be only temporary as the case returns to litigation. “The Supreme Court’s order earlier this year allowing Idaho’s abortion ban to go into effect caused a health and human rights crisis, as PHR [documented](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/idaho-abortion-bans/). The Court’s actions then and today, to quote Justice Jackson, create a ‘completely unnecessary catastrophe,’” said [Payal Shah, JD](https://phr.org/people/payal-shah/), who leads PHR’s reproductive justice work. “Ultimately, this case should have been decided in the interest of pregnant patients. The evidence PHR documented is clear: State bans that prohibit abortion in medical emergencies conflict with EMTALA and lead to devastating physical, mental, and financial harm to patients. Since January, the Idaho statute has significantly delayed necessary medical care for pregnant patients and has forced them to undergo dangerous, costly journeys for care that further threaten their health. For clinicians, practicing in such contexts is near impossible, leading to pregnant patients facing even greater barriers to accessing care as OB-GYNs leave the state,” said Shah. “Physicians for Human Rights made clear the grievous harms caused since the Supreme Court admittedly erroneously rescinded the stay on the Idaho law issued by the District Court. We are relieved that at least for the time-being pregnant patients in Idaho will be able to get the proper medical care that they need,” said Gerson Smoger, JD, PhD, chair of PHR’s Board of Directors. “By failing to act to clarify EMTALA’s preemption over state abortion bans without health exceptions, SCOTUS is essentially leaving pregnant patients in other states with bans, including Texas where a similar case is pending, still facing the same suffering and harm that they inflicted on pregnant Idahoans and their clinicians,” said Shah. PHR [filed an amicus brief](https://phr.org/news/idahos-abortion-ban-seriously-harms-the-health-of-patients-phr-amicus-brief-to-u-s-supreme-court/) in this case showing how Idaho’s abortion ban dangerously conflicts with U.S. government protections in EMTALA and leads to the denial of abortion care even in health emergencies. PHR’s amicus was based on a [PHR fact-finding brief](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/idaho-abortion-bans/) that documented accounts of physicians who could not properly treat pregnant patients in and from Idaho suffering emergency medical situations (such as PPROM and HELPP). Supreme Court Justice Jackson cited PHR’s amicus brief in both oral arguments and in her [opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-726_6jgm.pdf) as evidence of the harms of Idaho’s abortion bans and its inconsistency with EMTALA. “We appreciate the clinicians and patients who shared evidence and spoke out. Without their courage, we may have seen an even worse decision from the Supreme Court today. The medical evidence we gathered was recognized by the Court as showing that EMTALA and Idaho’s ban are inconsistent, but in the face of continued assaults on reproductive freedom we must double down on our efforts. We will work in solidarity with the healthcare community as this case inevitably works its way back through the legal system and attacks on reproductive justice continue,” said Shah. Since the reversal of Roe v. Wade, PHR has mobilized its medical and legal networks and partners to investigate, document, and spotlight the impacts of state-level abortion bans. PHR has worked alongside local and national partners to research and highlight the consequences of abortion criminalization on health care in [Louisiana](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/louisiana-abortion-bans/), [Oklahoma](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/oklahoma-abortion-rights/), [Texas](https://phr.org/news/physicians-for-human-rights-fights-texas-abortion-ban-in-amicus-brief-filed-in-zurawski-v-state-of-texas/), and [Idaho](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/idaho-abortion-bans/). Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.

It was also spotted amongst the crowd at Te Pāti Māori- organised nationwide protests last month .\nMulipola, a comic artist, said the fight for indigenous liberation and rights was the reason he brought the flag to that protest.\nThe protests were organised in response to the new coalition government policies around Te Tiriti o Waitangi, including the ACT Party’s bid to scrap the Māori Health Authority and Oranga Tamariki along with repealing the smokefree generation law.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. “For me, bringing the flag [was] because Māori are fighting for recognition,” he said.\n“This new government and the anti-Māori stance has kind of realised that the fight for freedom, the fight against oppression, isn’t over. None of us are free until all of us are free.”\nMulipola said of the unique flag: “It was designed because I kind of noticed that Samoans were quiet; especially online around the genocide happening in Palestine .\n“I decided to create a kind of image that would be symbolic of standing in solidarity with Palestine.”\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME.",

    "title": "Dayton Flyers not dominant against UMass but still victorious",
    "text": "Dayton Flyers forward DaRon Holmes II smiled and stuck out his tongue as he dribbled out the clock in a 64-60 victory against Massachusetts on Sunday at UD Arena.Everyone in the crowd of 13,407, meanwhile, breathed a sigh of relief. Dayton had sweated much in the final minutes of games since a 65-63 victory at Southern Methodist on Nov. 29. This game proved the 18-game Atlantic 10 Conference schedule will include as many nervous moments as joyful moments, and even the A-10 favorite, one of the hottest teams in the country, ranked No. 19 in the NCAA Evaluation Tool entering the game, will struggle at times.“That’s definitely one of the better teams in the A-10,” Holmes said. “They did a good job on the defensive end, especially in the second half. We struggled a little bit figuring it out, but we got the win, and that’s what matters most. We’ve just got to look back and reflect on what we can fix and go from there.”Dayton (12-2, 2-0) won its ninth straight game, its longest streak in four years, and eighth straight in the series against UMass (10-4, 1-1). The Flyers didn’t trail for the second straight game. However, unlike Wednesday when Dayton won 72-57 at Davidson , the Flyers were unable to protect a double-digit lead in the second half.Dayton led 38-29 at halftime and by as many as 13 points in the second half. It had a 57-47 lead with 4:55 to play. Then UMass scored eighth straight points in a 69-second span, trimming Dayton’s lead to 57-55 at the 3:26 mark.At that point, Dayton’s offense had gone stagnant with shots coming late in the shot clock and few shots falling. In a nine-minute stretch, Dayton had seven points on a 3-point play by Zimi Nwokeji, two free throws by Nate Santos and a layup by Holmes.UMass coach Frank Martin said a switch to a zone defense in the second half slowed Dayton and put his team in the position to rally.“I’m not real smart, and I’m a man-to-man guy,” Martin said, “but I’ve got little saying that I live by, ‘Don’t let stubborn make me stupid.’ And that zone was working.”UMass had a chance to take the lead at the 2:51 mark with Dayton leading 57-55, but Josh Cohen missed a 3-pointer. It had a chance to tie the game with 33 seconds left as Dayton clung to a 59-57 lead, but Cohen missed a jump shot.Dayton struggled to keep UMass off the offensive boards throughout the game. The Minutemen took advantage of Dayton’s big weakness and turned 20 offensive rebounds into 18 second-chance points. The Flyers did get key rebounds by Holmes and Isaac Jack in the final minute to secure the lead.Javon Bennett made 4 of 4 free throws in the final 30 seconds, and Jack made 1 of 2 as Dayton clinched the victory.Holmes led Dayton with 18 points on 7-of-14 shooting. He scored 14 of his points in the first half, making 3 of 4 3-pointers. Enoch Cheeks added 11 points.Nwokeji scored nine points, his highest total in more than a year, and made back-to-back 3-pointers in the first half. He played 14 minutes in part because freshman forward Petras Padegimas missed his second straight game with an illness and guard Kobe Elvis suffered a lower-body injury on the third play of the game.Elvis left the game and headed to the locker room but returned to play another three-minute stretch before leaving the game for good. After the game, Grant said, “We don’t have any answers in terms of Elvis’s status moving forward.”Elvis averaged 17.7 points in the last six games , and Dayton missed his presence in the second half as the offense went cold.“Obviously, today we faced some adversity with Elvis going down early,” Grant said, “and then in the second half, some of the adversity was self inflicted and some was a result of UMass doing a really good job from a defensive standpoint. They were able to impact us on the offensive end with the press and with the zone, so we struggled from an offensive standpoint. And they’re a terrific rebounding team. They were able to get back almost half of their misses and were able to make it a two-point game going into the last four minutes. I thought our guys did a really good job of being able to stay together, and we had guys step up and make plays when they needed to make plays.” FRIDAY’S GAME Dayton at Duquesne, 1 p.m., ESPN2, 1290, 95.7 Credit: David JablonskiCredit: David Jablonski",

    "text": "MarketHub Europe 2025 de HBX Group\nInteligencia artificial o cómo dar superpoderes a los equipos\nXabier Zabala, COO de HBX Group, sostiene que es necesaria la formación y el upskilling\nPublicada 03/04/25\n“La inteligencia artificial es uno de los mayores cambios que se han visto en la industria y continuaremos viéndolo en los próximos meses”, aseguró Xabier Zabala, director de Operaciones (COO) de HBX Group durante el MarketHub Europe 2025 que se está desarrollando en Algarve hasta el 4 de abril, planteando que en el entorno laboral habrá transformaciones a partir de la implementación de esta tecnología, “pero nuestro objetivo principal no es reemplazar a los humanos, sino darles superpoderes”.\nSegún Zabala, de la mano del uso de inteligencia artificial se ganará eficiencia en los equipos, “liberaremos tiempo para enfocarnos en actividades de mayor valor, mejoraremos la experiencia y el servicio al cliente” y eso, al mismo tiempo, acelerará el crecimiento del negocio\nDurante la primera jornada del MarketHub Europe 2025, el COO de la compañía explicó cinco usos clave de la IA Generativa, que responden a necesidades específicas e impulsan la innovación en los viajes en HBX Group.\n- Atención al cliente automatizada. La compañía ha creado una plataforma de IA que recibe y procesa todas las interacciones de los clientes a través de los diferentes canales, lo cual les permite identificar las búsquedas de los clientes, el idioma, las necesidades. Uniendo toda la información “podemos proporcionar una respuesta automática al cliente, o podemos ejecutar y organizar el trabajo de nuestros equipos sabiendo qué es lo que los clientes quieren”.\n“El resultado de esto son respuestas rápidas, por lo que mejora el servicio al cliente, mejora la experiencia y también aumenta la eficacia de nuestros equipos”, remarcando que se trata de “un cambio de juego, eso da superpoderes a nuestros equipos”\n- Gestión del conocimiento. Otra solución que ofrece la IA tiene que ver con ponerle fin a manuales de formación de cientos de páginas con instrucciones, protocolos y políticas a consultar para llevar a cabo la acción correcta en cada escenario. La IA puede dar soluciones instantáneas y precisas a las dudas de los equipos.\nEsta implementación, “acelera masivamente las acciones de nuestros equipos, creando más eficacia, mejor experiencia al cliente y, aún más importante, reduciendo errores y pérdidas de nuestros equipos”\n- Gemelos de voz de IA para la formación. Las simulaciones de voz impulsadas por IA permiten escenarios de formación ilimitados y realistas. “Podemos entrenarlo colocando 100 llamadas, simulando cualquier escenario, con múltiples niveles de dificultad y en diferentes idiomas, por lo que están mucho mejor preparados para las interacciones con nuestros clientes”, comentó el COO. Xavier Zabala asegura que esto crea una mejor experiencia para el cliente, pero también genera confianza en los empleados y les quita tensión y nervios.\n- Generación de contenido. La IA permite identificar errores gramaticales, mejorar la calidad del texto escrito y llevar a cabo traducciones instantáneas a varios idiomas, gracias a lo cual “hemos multiplicado en 100 la capacidad de nuestros equipos”.\n- Análisis de imágenes. La IA detecta imágenes duplicadas de hoteles y casos de fraude, garantizando la autenticidad de los contenidos y protegiendo la integridad de la marca.\nPara finalizar, Zabala insistió en que \"con todas estas herramientas seremos más productivos y más eficientes\", pero \"no hay que olvidarse de los humanos: necesitamos llevar a todos en este viaje, a través del entrenamiento, del upskilling y de la preparación, para hacer actividades de mayor valor en nuestros negocios\".",

    "text": "Global Blueprint for Health: WHO and UN Unveil Comprehensive Environmental Guide The \"Compendium of WHO and Other UN Guidance on Health and Environment\" (2024 update) provides a consolidated source of guidance on health and environmental factors, targeting policy-makers to aid in reducing preventable environmental risks. This essential resource addresses major health determinants and emphasizes intersectoral collaboration for effective interventions. Available from WHO. [CoE-EDP, VisionRI](/Home/AuthorArticles?fl=CoE-EDP, VisionRI)| Updated: 05-07-2024 12:20 IST | Created: 05-07-2024 12:20 IST In an era where environmental and health challenges are intricately linked, the \"Compendium of WHO and Other UN Guidance on Health and Environment\" emerges as a beacon of consolidated knowledge. Updated in 2024, this compendium brings together essential guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other United Nations (UN) agencies, offering a robust framework for policy-makers to address the significant health risks posed by environmental factors. Addressing Environmental Risks to Health Environmental risks are responsible for approximately 24% of global deaths, a staggering figure that underscores the critical need for preventive action. The compendium highlights the significant health benefits that can be achieved by mitigating these risks. For instance, tackling air pollution could prevent a large number of deaths from ischemic heart disease, strokes, lung cancers, and respiratory infections. Similarly, improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) could drastically reduce diarrheal diseases, while better management of chemicals could prevent numerous unintentional poisonings. The compendium provides detailed strategies to address both ambient and indoor air pollution, covering sources such as household cooking and heating, as well as the environmental impacts of tobacco smoke and mold. It also outlines comprehensive guidelines for ensuring safe drinking water, managing recreational water, improving sanitation, and promoting personal hygiene practices. Comprehensive Environmental Health Factors The guidance within the compendium covers a wide range of environmental health factors essential for maintaining public health. These include ensuring clean air, a stable climate, adequate WASH facilities, safe chemical use, radiation protection, sound waste management, healthy workplaces, supportive cities, sustainable diets, and the preservation of biodiversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the intrinsic linkages between human health and nature, reinforcing the need for integrated strategies that encompass both health and environmental considerations. Implementing Cross-Cutting Approaches A notable feature of the compendium is its emphasis on cross-cutting topics such as One Health, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health. This approach is crucial for addressing complex health challenges that span multiple sectors. The guidance also includes Health Impact Assessments (HIA) to evaluate the health effects of policies and projects, promoting a holistic view of health that goes beyond traditional boundaries. Each section of the compendium is classified by sectors involved, level of implementation, implementation instruments, and evidence category, making it a practical tool for policy-makers. It provides references to key resources, exposure assessments, guideline values, and tools for assessments and interventions, ensuring that users have access to comprehensive and up-to-date information. Tools and Resources for Effective Implementation The compendium is not just a repository of guidelines; it is a toolkit for action. It offers practical tools for assessment, intervention implementation, and capacity-building. Policy-makers and other stakeholders can find detailed recommendations for maintaining occupational health and safety, promoting healthy work environments, and preventing work-related diseases and injuries. By compiling guidance from various UN agencies, the compendium supports the strategic objectives of the WHO Global Strategy on Health, Environment, and Climate Change. It aims to scale up action on health determinants in all policies and sectors, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A Critical Resource for Policy-Makers The compendium serves as a critical resource for decision-makers in the health and environmental sectors. It provides evidence-based guidance to improve public health outcomes through environmental action, underscoring the importance of intersectoral collaboration and comprehensive approaches to health and environmental challenges. As new evidence and recommendations emerge, the compendium will continue to be updated, ensuring that it remains a relevant and valuable tool for creating healthier environments. - FIRST PUBLISHED IN: - Devdiscourse ALSO READ [Ecuador Plunged Into Darkness: Power Restored After Nationwide Outage](/article/headlines/2988677-ecuador-plunged-into-darkness-power-restored-after-nationwide-outage) [Steady Pound Awaits BoE Decision Amid Currency Market Tight Ranges](/article/sports-games/2988679-steady-pound-awaits-boe-decision-amid-currency-market-tight-ranges) [Top Stories in Finance: JPMorgan Lifts Bonus Cap, Labour's Tax Loophole Stand, Rival AI Start-up by OpenAI Co-founder](/article/business/2988681-top-stories-in-finance-jpmorgan-lifts-bonus-cap-labours-tax-loophole-stand-rival-ai-start-up-by-openai-co-founder) [India's Economic Growth: Speedy, But Unequal](/article/education/2988685-indias-economic-growth-speedy-but-unequal) [Punjab Police conducts massive raids across top 10 drugs hotspots of each districts](/article/headlines/2988703-punjab-police-conducts-massive-raids-across-top-10-drugs-hotspots-of-each-districts)",

    "text": "Android-Smartphones: Samsung enttäuscht im Ranking\nSamsung fällt im Leistungsvergleich der Smartphones im Juli zurück: Die Analysen einer Plattform offenbaren deutlich leistungsfähigere Konkurrenten.\nFrankfurt/Peking – Im aktuellsten Leistungsvergleich der schnellsten Android-Smartphones schneidet Samsung nicht gut ab. Ein Gaming-Handy führt die Rangliste der Plattform AnTuTu hingegen an. Das geht aus Juli-Daten des Anbieters, der den chinesischen Markt monatlich analysiert, hervor. Dabei fokussiert dieser sich auf Smartphones mit dem Betriebssystem Android.\nWie eingangs erwähnt sicherte sich das Red Magic 10S Pro+, ein Smartphone, das laut chip.de in Gamingkreisen beliebt ist, den ersten Platz im AnTuTu-Ranking in China. Den zweiten Platz erhielt das Vivo X200 Ulta. Das erste Samsung-Smartphone rangiert hingegen erst auf Platz 10 der aktuellsten Version des Rankings.\nIm Vergleich: Das sind die schnellsten Android-Smartphones\nDas gesamte Ranking im kompakten Überblick:\nPlatzierung | Gerät |\n---|---|\n1 | Red Magic 10 Pro |\n2 | iQOO 13 |\n3 | vivo X200 Ultra |\n4 | OnePlus 13 |\n5 | Poco F7 Ultra |\n6 | Mi 15 Ultra |\n7 | vivo X200 Pro |\n8 | Mi 15 |\n9 | vivo X200 Pro mini |\n10 | Galaxy S25 Ultra |\nQuelle: antutu.com |\nBeim angesprochenen Samsung-Gerät handelt es sich um das Galaxy S25 Ultra. Laut Angaben von Jörn Schmidt, der regelmäßig auf seinem Blog schmidtisblog.de über die Thematik berichtet, brachte die Juli-Bewertung des Anbieters allerdings kaum Veränderungen auf den Spitzenplätzen – bereits zum dritten Mal in Folge. Demnach könnte jedoch im Herbst 2025 Bewegung in den Markt kommen, da neue Prozessoren der Anbieter MediaTek und Qualcomm erwartet werden. Diese könnten maßgebliche Auswirkungen beim Thema Schnelligkeit der Geräte haben.\nÜber die Plattform\nAnTuTu (chinesisch: 安兔兔) ist laut eigenen Angaben eine weit verbreitete Benchmark-Software zur Leistungsmessung von Smartphones und anderen Geräten. Die Plattform wurde im Januar 2011 als Android-Benchmark-Anwendung gestartet.\nDie Rangliste des Anbieters basiert auf Durchschnittswerten von Benchmarks, die wiederum nützliche Nutzerstatistiken mit mindestens 1000 gültigen Ergebnissen im jeweiligen Monaten abbilden – im aktuellen Fall aus dem Juli 2025.\nInwiefern die Ergebnisse des Rankings zum chinesischen Markt auf den deutschen Markt übertragbar sind, muss allerdings kritisch hinterfragt werden.\nTipps und Tricks: Wird Ihr Android-Smartphone langsamer?\nMit der Nutzungszeit nimmt die Geschwindigkeit vieler Smartphones, die Android als Betriebssystem nutzen, ab – völlig unabhängig vom Gerät. Vielfach kann dieser Entwicklung jedoch entgegengewirkt werden. Folgende Tipps können laut dem Portal giga.de offenbar helfen:\n- Deaktivieren Sie Animationen: Unter dem Puntk „Eingabehilfen“ können im Menü Animationen ausgeschaltet werden. Auf diese Weise wird Rechenleistung gespart, vor allem beim Wechseln und Öffnen von Fenstern.\n- Leeren Sie Ihren Cache: Der Cache von Apps kann demnach problemlos geleert werden, um Speicherplatz freizugeben – ganz im Gegenteil zum Cache von Browsern, die wichtige Daten für Websites, die alltäglich angesteuert werden, liefern.\n- Schränken Sie Hintergrundprozesse ein: Apps, die dauerhaft im Hintergrund laufen, können problemlos entfernt werden.\n- Entfernen Sie Bloatware: Sogenannte Bloatware ist meist vorinstalliert und belegt Speicherplatz. Vielfach ist sie aber nicht notwendig und kann deinstalliert werden.\n(tu) Verwendete Quellen: antutu.com, chip.de, schmidtisblog.de, giga.de",
