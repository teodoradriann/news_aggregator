    "text": "South Australia's farmers are worried about water supplies for livestock as drought conditions cause dams to dry up across the state. South Australia's farmers are increasingly worried about water supplies for their livestock, as drought conditions cause dams to dry up across the state.\nMuch of the state has experienced a record-dry year, with emergency measures put in place in the Adelaide Hills and Fleurieu this week to assist properties not connected to mains water.\nLivestock SA chief executive Travis Tobin said conditions varied across the state, but the greatest impact was in areas such as Kangaroo Island and the Barossa Valley, which usually had reliable higher rainfall.\nOne of Keith Bolto's dams on Kangaroo Island which has run dry. (Supplied: Keith Bolto)\n\"They tend not to have such large dams that have longer holding capacities … so the deeper the drought gets, those water infrastructure points don't hold up,\" Mr Tobin said.\n\" They're not prepared usually for long sustained dry periods, because that's not what's experienced in those parts of the state. \"\nWater deliveries extra cost\nMr Tobin said water deliveries were a cost many farmers could not afford after months of buying livestock feed.\n\"If they've reached a point where they're having to buy in water, they'll be having to make some difficult decisions as to whether they hold on to those stock and provide all the feed and water requirements for those animals, or whether they consider selling those animals off,\" he said.\n\"[What] makes that decision even more difficult is you're selling an animal that's not going to be in prime condition, so it won't meet top of the…\nKate Higgins , Selina Green , Cassandra Hough",

    "text": "On Thursday night, Dec. 28, workers at Advanced Grow Labs in the New Haven County city of West Haven voted unanimously to ratify their union contract, according to a United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 919 spokesperson.\nThe contract is the first such cannabis union agreement in the history of Connecticut and includes guaranteed wage increases of up to 25 percent over three years, increased holiday pay, secured retirement and health insurance, increased safety measures, and on-the-job protection.\nThe ratification comes months after workers at AGL formed the union in March 2023, becoming the first cannabis workers in Connecticut to do so.\n“I am proud to be a part of the first cannabis union in Connecticut,” said AGL Production Technician Alanna Daniels, who continued, \"This has been a huge milestone for the industry in the state and our company. I hope other workers can come together like we have.”\nAGL Harvest Technician Christopher Mckenzie called the agreement \"groundbreaking.\"\n“We have a voice at work now and a better future coming now that we have a union contract,\" Mckenzie added.\nThe UFCW, which represents tens of thousands of cannabis workers across the US in dispensaries, labs, delivery, kitchens, manufacturing, processing, grow facilities, and more, is the country's largest cannabis workers union.\nAny other cannabis workers interested in forming a union at their workplace can call UFCW Local 919 Director of Organizing Emily Sabo at 203-915-4561.\n ",

    "text": "转自：北京日报客户端\n北京商业航天企业穿越者载人航天近日完成了亚轨道载人飞船可重复使用主动防热技术验证试验。中国振动工程学会振动与噪声控制专业委员会副理事长向树红评价，这是我国商业航天领域首次主动防热技术验证试验，证明了飞船主动防热技术的有效性，以及该技术在再入飞行器领域应用的潜力。\n当飞船再入大气层时，舱体与空气的剧烈摩擦会产生高温。“目前常用的被动防热技术，本质是‘以牺牲换生存’，不能重复使用。”向树红说，防热是载人飞船独有的关键技术挑战之一。主动防热技术是当前新兴的热防护理念。\n“为了研发可循环使用的‘防火墙’，我们在地面模拟‘宇宙焰火’。”该企业创始人、首席执行官雷诗情介绍，最终，团队在试验材料上加工了大量毫米级直径的微型气道，低温气体从中喷出，形成气膜墙，起到防火作用。\n在试验现场，持续两个小时的试验中，试验件的核心结构温度稳定在600摄氏度以下，材料没有出现熔融或变形，冷却效率达58%。雷诗情表示，团队将持续优化载人飞船产品，特别是将针对飞船返回舱再入过程中舱体受热最严重的部位，开展主动防热系统的优化设计，力求以最低的系统重量实现最大的防热效果。\n该企业计划在2026年进行国内首次全尺寸载人飞船亚轨道无人飞行试验。届时，飞船将局部搭载此次试验的主动防热技术，开展飞行验证。预计在两次同类试验后，2028年亚轨道载人飞行有望实现。普通人也将有机会遨游太空。\n来源：北京日报",
