In this Bride’s Handbook, we’ll delve into the art of styling your engagement ring to perfection, ensuring it becomes the star of the show.\nChoosing the Perfect Ring\nBefore diving into styling, let’s revisit the moment you said “yes!” Choosing the right engagement ring is crucial because you’ll be wearing it forever. When selecting a ring, consider your style, personality, and lifestyle. Do you prefer modern or vintage looks? What metal complements your skin tone?

While trends come and go, a ring that embodies your essence will always look chic. Let your ring tell the story of your unique love; its styling possibilities are endless!\nThe Classic Solitaire Elegance\nSolitaire diamond rings are timeless classics for a reason. A single dazzling stone speaks volumes in its simplicity and elegance.\nSolitaires first became popular in the mid-1800s, and their iconic style still shines today. The solitary diamond draws the eye instantly. Without extra stones or ornate metalwork competing for attention, a solitaire diamond ring makes your center stone the star.\nSurrounded by the gleaming band, the diamond pops beautifully. This versatile design complements any bridal look seamlessly. A solitaire adds effortless elegance, whether you’re wearing glamorous gowns or casual everyday attire.\nSolitaires also maximize light refraction in the diamond for irresistible brilliance. If you crave showstopping sparkle in a traditional, romantic style, choosing a solitaire is the perfect decision.\nHalo Brilliance: A Timeless Touch\nFor brides dreaming of an extra dazzling display, halo engagement rings add timeless romance. This setting places smaller diamonds in a circle around the center stone. The halo of shimmering stones not only enhances the main diamond’s fire and brilliance but also amplifies its perceived size. It creates an entrancing floating effect, giving the ring an ethereal beauty.\nHalos date back to the Georgian era but feel completely contemporary. The halo’s sentimental meaning of gathering loved ones makes it extra meaningful for brides. The halo’s allure is undeniable, from glitzy vintage designs to sleek modern settings. This wedding staple flatters any diamond shape or hand size. Surround yourself with magical brilliance with this special touch!\nModern Twist with Colored Diamonds\nWant to break from tradition?

Natural fancy colored diamonds come in every imaginable shade, from pale pink to bold yellow, with hues of blue, green, and red resembling vivid rainbows. These\nkaleidoscopic diamonds infuse your ring with personality.\nFor a soft and feminine vibe, try a peachy morganite or pink champagne diamond. Sapphire-blue stones evoke strength and eternal love. Yellow radiates joy and optimism.\nColored diamonds look particularly modern in art deco or bezel settings.\nAlternatively, give a traditional solitaire or halo a colorful update by changing the pavé diamonds. Make the ring uniquely yours by customizing your diamond tint. From pastel hues to bridal bling with a chocolate diamond, the options are limitless.\nEnhancing with Ring Guards and Wraps\nIn addition to choosing a spectacular center ring, take your ensemble to the next level with guards and wraps! These ring accessories not only protect your precious stone but also elevate its beauty. Diamond wraps encircle your engagement ring with a line of glittering stones.\nThis instantly gives your ring an extra sparkle while accentuating the main stone. Popular options include bead-set wraps for vintage romance or four-prong wraps with baguette diamonds for modern glam.\nFor added security, diamond guards act like bumpers on each side of your e-ring band. This keeps the diamond safe from chips and scratches. Opt for matching guards for a cohesive, layered look or contrasting metal guards for an eclectic style.\nNo matter which you choose, guards and wraps lend a luxe, finished look to your ensemble. Protect your diamond while boosting its brilliance!\nNailing the Ring Selfie\nOnce you complete your dream ring, you’ll no doubt be snapping plenty of photos to share the joyful news! Make sure your diamond dazzles with these pro ring selfie tips.\nLighting is key; outdoor shots use soft, natural light to make your diamond sparkle. Indoors, position your hand near the windows. For nighttime, indoor accent lighting through lamps or Christmas lights works beautifully.\nGet up close and personal with a focal point on the ring to highlight all the details. Shoot from above, pointing your hand slightly upwards and wiggling your fingers to catch the light.\nConsider black and white filters if the diamond lacks color. Monochrome makes the most of brilliance and shape. Have fun playing with accessories like flowers or books to compose creative images and show off that bling!\nTips for Keeping Your Ring Gleaming\nYou want your engagement ring to dazzle every single time it’s on display. Follow these tips to keep your diamond looking its radiant best. Prevent dirt buildup and clouding by:\n- Cleaning regularly with detergent-free jewelry cleaner or mild soap and water\n- Storing in a fabric-lined box or individually wrapped in soft cloth when not wearing\n- Removing during messy tasks – don’t wear when cooking, gardening, etc.\n- Visiting your jeweler once a year for professional cleaning\n- Inspecting settings and prongs frequently for loose stones or damage\nAlso, be mindful even during everyday wear. Apply lotion and perfume before rings to avoid chemical buildup. Gloves protect rings from chlorine and other chemicals when washing dishes.\nWith occasional professional care and smart daily habits, your diamond will stay picture-perfect!\nCustomization: Adding a Personal Touch\nAn important part of styling your ensemble is customizing your e-ring or band to make it distinctly yours. Personalized details give deeper meaning to your ring.\nEngraving the inside of your band with a special date, lyric, or message makes your commitment tangible. Etch your wedding date or initials on the outside of the band for a subtle detail.\nFor e-rings, incorporate unique design elements like colored accent stones that represent your birth month, an oval diamond to match your face shape, an asymmetric setting, or customized engraving.\nYou can also reset family diamonds or incorporate pieces from heirlooms into your setting for a sentimental touch. Your jeweler can help create a custom ring that celebrates your love story.\nYou are adding your unique mark, which results in a much more meaningful symbol of your relationship.\nConclusion\nAs you embark on this exciting journey to the aisle, remember that your engagement ring is so much more than just jewelry. It’s a symbol of your relationship and enduring commitment. Let the tips in this guide help you style your ring proudly to complement your individuality and wedding style.

    "title": "Russia May Finally Capture Vuhledar. It Has Cost Thousands Of Troops.",
    "text": "Since late 2022, Russian forces have been trying to capture Vuhledar, a mining town with a pre-war population of 14,000 that anchors the point in Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast where the southern front line bends left and threads north through eastern Ukraine.\nThey may finally be on the cusp of succeeding. A determined assault by the Russian army’s 57th Motor Rifle Brigade that kicked off this week has breached the defenses of the Ukrainian army’s 72nd Mechanized Brigade. Now Russian troops are in southern Vuhledar—and the weary Ukrainian garrison may already be retreating to the north.\nIf the 57th Motor Rifle Brigade captures the bomb-blasted ruins of Vuhledar in the coming days, it’ll be a victory for Russia—but a highly qualified one. Just reaching the outskirts of Vuhledar has cost the Russian armed forces around a thousand vehicles and potentially several thousand troops.\nThe 72nd Mechanized Brigade’s stubborn defense of Vuhledar—with mines, artillery, anti-tank missiles and drones—has destroyed entire Russian brigades.\nA monthslong series of Russian assaults across the fields outside Vuhledar in late 2022 and early 2023 may have been the costliest for the Russians. At the time, Russian operations in this sector were led by a pair of marine units belonging to the Russian navy’s Pacific fleet: the 40th and 155th Naval Infantry Brigades.\nThe marines’ failed attacks on Vuhledar between November 2022 and February 2023 were among the bloodiest of the war to this point. The 155th Naval Infantry Brigade, which on paper had around 3,000 troops, lost as many as 300 troops a day for days on end and was “nearly destroyed” by February 2023, according to the Warsaw Institute, a Polish think tank.\nThe Kremlin sent replacement troops—and ordered the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade back into action. It promptly got destroyed again. “The 155th has likely been reduced to combat ineffective status at least twice in the last six months, due to being committed to tactically flawed frontal assaults near Vuhledar,” the U.K. defense ministry concluded in April 2023.\nThe 40th Naval Infantry Brigade may have fared slightly better, but not by much. Altogether, the marine brigades and supporting army units also wrote off around a thousand tanks, fighting vehicles, trucks and artillery pieces, according to a tally by WarSpotting, a collective that scours social media for evidence of wrecked vehicles in Ukraine.\nNot coincidentally, that’s around two brigades’ worth of vehicles—and nearly six percent of all vehicles Russia has lost in 31 months of hard fighting in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces’ own losses in and around Vuhledar were much lighter, as they mostly hunkered in their trenches and bunkers and blasted the attacking Russians from a distance with mines, artillery, missiles and drones.\nToday, the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade has shifted a few miles to the west along the southern front, leaving the current attacks on Vuhledar to the army. The third iteration of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade is up north in Russia’s Kursk Oblast, counterattacking invading Ukrainian forces.\nWhether the occupation of the ruins of Vuhledar justifies the repeated destruction of one or both of these brigades is a question only the Kremlin, and the survivors of the ill-fated units, can answer.\nSources:\n1.

    "text": "Modi's Ayodhya visit today is a prelude to Ram temple inauguration and has electoral significance Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Ayodhya today, ahead of the inauguration of the Ram temple, and the moment carries profound cultural, religious and political significance. The visit is also about the various projects to be inaugurated in keeping with the Prime Minister's vision to modernise the infrastructure in Ayodhya to place it on the national tourist map. The visit will involve a series of significant inaugurations and dedications. Modi will inaugurate the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station, launching new Amrit Bharat trains and Vande Bharat trains. He will also inaugurate the newly constructed Ayodhya airport. Besides, the foundation stones for a few more infrastructure projects will contribute to the beautification and enhancement of civic facilities in and around the ancient city. Though it sounds like a regular PM visit, it is not. The visit comes ahead of the inauguration of the Ram temple on January 22. Basically, the Prime Minister's visit serves as a symbolic tribute to the temple. It would be pertinent to add that the temple, which has been constructed at the site where the Babri mosque once stood, has been a contentious issue for decades and has been a polarising factor. In fact, the BJP owes its meteoric political rise to the demolition of the Babri mosque and subsequent campaign to construct the Ram temple there. The Supreme Court's verdict in November 2019 paved the way for the construction of the Ram temple, bringing an end to a protracted legal battle and giving way to the fulfilment of a significant promise made by the BJP. Ironically, Lal Krishna Advani, the man who spearheaded the campaign, may not be in attendance at the inaugural event. Indeed, the inauguration of the Ram temple holds immense cultural and religious significance for the majority Hindu population in India. Ayodhya is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, a revered figure in Hinduism, and the construction of his temple there has been a longstanding dream for millions of Hindus. The Prime Minister's presence in Ayodhya reiterates the Government's commitment to fulfilling the cultural and religious aspirations of people, besides underscoring the BJP's alignment with the sentiments of a significant percentage of the electorate. It would be naïve to believe that PM Modi's visit to Ayodhya is all about the physical redevelopment of Ayodhya. The timing of the visit, subsequent inauguration coming ahead of the 2024 general elections and amidst ongoing political developments is strategic. The BJP has historically aligned itself with Hindu nationalist sentiments, and the fulfilment of the Ram temple promise is likely to resonate positively with a large section of the electorate, particularly in the Hindi heartland where the party seeks to consolidate its support. The Ram temple issue has been a key element in the BJP's political narrative, and the party has consistently portrayed itself as the guardian of Hindu interests. PM Modi's visit reinforces the BJP's commitment to these ideals and may consolidate its votes in the Lok Sabha elections.",

Borrell has called for restrictions to be lifted to allow Ukrainian armed forces to use long-range Western weapons inside Russia. Borrell wrote on X that Ukraine’s invasion is “a severe blow to Russian President Putin’s narrative.” He then said the West should be “lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities vs the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law.” Read more related news: [Russia files ‘criminal charges’ against CNN reporter who entered Kursk ‘illegally’](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/russia-files-criminal-charges-against-cnn-reporter-who-entered-kursk-illegally/) [Russian intelligence claims to have exposed NATO’s role in attacking the Kursk region](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/russian-intelligence-claims-to-have-exposed-natos-role-in-attacking-the-kursk-region/) [Kyiv never told the West of Kursk incursion over their fears of crossing Putin’s nuclear ‘red lines’](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/kyiv-never-told-the-west-of-kursk-incursion-over-their-fears-of-crossing-putins-nuclear-red-lines/) [Ukraine launches a massive hack on Russian TV to ‘expose the reality of the war’ to its citizens] Borrell said that this would then “strengthen Ukrainian self-defence by ending Russia’s sanctuary for its attacks,” this will save lives and stop Moscow dead in their tracks. Russia has also been accusing NATO of being on the ground in Kursk along with mercenaries who are actively participating in Ukraine’s incursion. Apty Alaudinov, Akhmat commander and deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces’said he suspects there could be active-duty service members from NATO who are serving as mercenaries in the Kursk region. The commander told Rossiya-1 television, “You must understand that they have thrown together a ragtag army. And they have deployed as many foreign mercenaries as they could to there. “I guess there are people among these foreign mercenaries who are in the military of the NATO bloc.”",

    "text": "Polonia se impuso 2-3 a Escocia en el Hampden Park de Glasgow para comenzar a lo grande su andadura en el Grupo 1 de la League A de la Nations League. A sus 36 años recién cumplidos, Robert Lewandowski fue protagonista con una asistencia y un gol de penalti en una primera parte que acabó 0-2, aunque, tras la reacción y el empate del conjunto escocés, el 2-3 no llegó hasta el 97', ya sin el barcelonista en el campo, con otro gol de penalti de quizás el mejor jugador del partido: Nicola Zalewski, interior zurdo de 22 años de la Roma. Lewandowski vio la llegada de Sebastian Szymanski en el minuto 8 y le dejó un balón que el centrocampista de 25 años del Fenerbahçe, tras controlar, convirtió en el 0-1 con un zurdazo desde fuera del área que tocó en el poste antes de entrar. Escocia celebró el empate en el 23', pero el VAR avisó al árbitro sueco Glen Nyberg de una mano y McTominay se quedó sin gol. Y antes del descanso, las dos estrellas de Polonia se aliaron para lograr el 0-2. Zalewski provocó un penalti y Lewandowski lo transformó en el 44' con su nuevo estilo, de forma más directa, sin paradinha. Era su gol 84 con Polonia en 153 partidos, igualando al mítico Ferenc Puskas (Hungría y España) en el 8º puesto del ránking de artilleros de selecciones. El belga Romeu Lukaku y Ali Mabkhout (EAU), que suman 85, son sus próximos objetivos. Y Mokhtar Dahari (Malasia), 5º con 89, no anda lejos. Sin embargo, Escocia tiró de orgullo en la segunda parte y logró empatar el partido gracias a una embestida de Gilmour en el 46' y, tras el cambio de Lewandowski en el 71' con 1-2, a otra llegada desde la segunda línea de McTominay en el 76', esta vez legal. Con Escocia decidida a completar la remontada, Polonia encontró petróleo en una contra que acabó en el segundo penalti del partido. Sin Lewy, lo lanzó Zalewski y logró el 2-3 definitivo.",

    "text": "Lusa 31 dez 2023 12:53 Atualidade Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar PR de Cabo Verde pede \"confiança e alento\" para acreditar num ano de paz em 2024 O Presidente de Cabo Verde, José Maria Neves, pediu hoje aos cabo-verdianos \"confiança e alento suficientes\" para acreditar que 2024 será um ano de paz, com menos pobreza, desemprego e menos desigualdades sociais.\n\"Temos de ter confiança e alento suficientes para acreditar que 2024 será um ano de paz, principalmente pela cessação dos conflitos com evidente desprezo pela vida humana\", afirmou José Maria Neves, na tradicional mensagem de novo ano.\nO chefe de Estado cabo-verdiano sublinhou os \"tempos difíceis\" que se vivem a nível mundial, no contexto dos conflitos na Ucrânia e no Médio Oriente, assinalando as incertezas do próximo ano.\n\"É certo que atravessamos uma crise estrutural global, para a qual ainda não se vislumbra nem o fim, nem a duração, e nem o seu desfecho. São tempos difíceis, de crise e de estagnação, e com um retrocesso histórico na democracia. A sensação é a de que a insensatez impera, e que vozes autorizadas, como as do Secretário Geral das Nações Unidas ou do Papa Francisco, têm pregado no deserto\", assinalou.\nRecordando que Cabo Verde defende a Carta das Nações Unidas e o Direito Humanitário, José Maria Neves manifestou o desejo de que terminem \"as situações coloniais anacrónicas de ocupações ilegais de territórios\", repudiando também \"os ataques maciços infligidos à população civil indefesa, com massacres de mulheres e crianças, só comparáveis ao pior que aconteceu durante a segunda guerra mundial\".\n\"Ambicionamos por um 2024 com menos pobreza, menos desemprego e menos desigualdades sociais, que são fenómenos corrosivos, para qualquer sociedade. Que estejamos determinados a encontrar os melhores caminhos, principalmente para a redução da pobreza extrema, eliminando a insegurança alimentar e as condições de vida degradantes, garantindo uma existência mais digna para todos os cabo-verdianos\", referiu.\nComo um outro desafio para o ano novo, o Presidente da República apontou a questão da insegurança e da criminalidade em Cabo Verde.\n\"Esperamos mais sucesso nesta luta, a bem de um clima de maior tranquilidade e harmonia social\", sustentou.\nJosé Maria Neves destacou também a necessidade de melhorar a qualidade da educação e de ter em conta as reivindicações dos professores, bem como de promover uma melhor avaliação da prestação dos serviços disponibilizados na área da saúde.\n\"Nos transportes, marítimos e aéreos, face à regressão que se constata, auguramos que aconteçam melhorias significativas durante este ano. No geral, desejamos que as reivindicações de vários grupos profissionais possam merecer a devida atenção, pois, muitas delas parecem ser justas\", continuou.\nIndicou ainda que o diálogo deve ser eleito como a \"melhor forma\" para encontrar soluções para os diferendos e apontou uma revisão da política salarial do Estado, para que haja \"maior equilíbrio\" e justiça entre os diferentes grupos profissionais.\n\"Nos próximos anos, devemos dispensar uma atenção especial aos oceanos, sendo fundamental a sua proteção e também potenciar todos os recursos marinhos. Vivemos tempos difíceis, pelo que continua a ser necessário envidar esforços para garantir, tanto a segurança alimentar como a segurança energética, bem como implementar inovações tecnológicas\", disse José Maria Neves.\nROZS/CFF // FPA\nLusa/Fim A dose certa de informação.

    "text": "The celebrated movie Nyad is a remarkable true story about athlete Diana Nyad (played by Annette Bening). Nyad, at the age of 60, along with the help of her best friend, Bonnie Stoll (played by Jodie Foster), sets-out to conquer her dream of swimming from Cuba to Florida. It’s a daunting, yet overly inspiring story that screenwriter, Julia Cox brought to life. Cox recently received the Sun Valley Film Festival’s High Scribe Award, given to an individual with a profound insight. Idaho Today’s Mellisa Paul had the honor and pleasure of speaking with Julia Cox to not only hear how she paid honor to this larger than life true story, but what it was like working with two Hollywood heavy-weights like Jodie Foster and Annette Bening. The film Nyad has received multiple award nominations including The Golden Globes and most recently the Oscars. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n[Idaho Today](/section/idaho-today)\nA Conversation With The Screen Writer Of Oscar Nominated Film Nyad Starring Jodie Foster And Annette Bening\nThe celebrated movie Nyad is a remarkable true story about athlete Diana Nyad (played by Annette Bening).",
