    "text": "项目强省会｜济南一家企业将“意念控制”变成现实\n舜网-济南时报\n研发人员正在对脑机接口设备进行测试 济南时报·新黄河客户端记者梁明星 摄\n科幻电影中，我们常常看到这样的场景：未来世界的人们只用意念或想象，就能操控无人机编队、指挥机械臂完成精密操作，甚至能通过“脑电波”与外界对话。4月1日，记者来到山东中科先进技术有限公司(以下简称“山东先进院”)，当研究人员佩戴上脑电采集帽，凭借“意念”操控无人机起落、翻转，在电脑屏幕上打字，还能控制外骨骼带动下肢走路，那些“科幻片段”正一步步变成现实。\n隔空操控，无人机精准起飞\n在山东先进院的实验室里，研究人员佩戴着插着电极片的脑电帽，坐在电脑屏幕前，屏幕上显示着向上、向下、向左、向右等指令。研究人员并没有做任何手部动作，只是眼睛聚焦在指令中的某一个，在他身后的三架小型无人机就准确地接收到了指令，整齐地进行各种动作。\n“山东中科先进技术有限公司欢迎你”，另一位研究人员则通过眼睛不断注视电脑屏幕上出现的26个字母中的某个字符，就在屏幕上打出了汉字，同样也不需要其他任何动作。\n实验室中还有一台脑控下肢外骨骼运动康复训练系统，记者注意到，研究人员佩戴脑电帽和一副眼镜，即可通过意念控制外骨骼带动下肢进行运动。\n完成这些“意念控制”动作的是山东先进院自主研发的脑机接口系统。什么是脑机接口?“脑机接口，顾名思义，就是在人的大脑与外部设备之间，搭建起一条传递信息的‘高速公路’，不通过手和嘴就可以控制外部设备，真正实现‘意念控制’。”山东先进院总经理李卫民告诉记者，“这套系统包括信号采集、分析解码、执行控制、反馈调节等四个部分。”\n从“微弱信号”到“精准解码”\n其实，2019年，由山东先进院脑机接口研究中心执行主任彭福来博士领衔的研发团队就做出了脑机接口的实验室装备，这套系统采取的是非侵入式的脑机接口装备，相比侵入式的脑机接口装备，这种方式不需要将电极植入大脑，安全性更高，但采集的脑电信号相对就会微弱很多，在输送过程中也会面临很多干扰。\n通过不断改进装备和优化算法，如今，山东先进院已先后打造了脑控无人机、脑控下肢康复机器人、意念打字等多个项目。\n“脑控无人机是通过我们自主研发的脑电采集系统捕捉用户大脑神经元活动产生的脑电信号，经过放大、滤波等预处理后，利用算法进行特征提取和解码，转换为控制无人机的命令，打造脑控无人机编队，实现向上、向下等九种指令控制。”彭福来介绍，“而意念打字则是利用稳态视觉诱发电位信号来识别人的意图并进行操作。当用户注视虚拟键盘中的某个字符时，相应的脑电波模式被检测并解码，从而实现字符的输入。该技术已经能够实现平均打字速度每分钟20个字符，准确率高达94.4%。”\n脑控下肢外骨骼运动康复训练系统结合了脑机接口技术、机器人技术和康复医学，通过解读大脑信号来控制外骨骼的运动，帮助下肢运动功能障碍的患者恢复行走能力，为他们提供康复训练，促进康复治疗。“这是一种‘主动’康复。”医疗康复率先破冰\n在李卫民看来，脑机接口技术的应用前景十分广阔。\n目前，山东先进院的脑机接口产品已成功应用在301医院、齐鲁医院等20余家临床和科研机构。山东先进院的脑机接口团队还在2024世界机器人大会的BCI脑控机器人大赛中斩获产业贡献奖，得到广大科技工作者和投融资人士的重点关注。\n脑机接口是生命科学和信息技术交叉融合的前沿领域。山东省《关于科技创新引领未来产业布局培育发展新质生产力的实施方案》中，脑机接口被列为重点发展方向。\n未来，随着技术的进步，脑机接口技术将逐步拓展到科研教育、生活娱乐、军事等多个领域。比如对驾驶员进行疲劳监测，提高驾驶安全;识别人的情绪状态，进行心理健康评估和治疗;监测运动员的大脑活动等。\n“脑机接口技术已经展现出了广泛的应用潜力和未来科技生活的新图景，将会极大地改变我们的生活。”李卫民说。",

    "text": "Modi also spoke to HM Amit Shah and discussed the deployment of security forces and counter-terror operations, government sources said NEW DELHI: Following back-to-back terror attacks in the last four days, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reviewed the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir in a high-level meeting. He asked the officials to deploy the \"full spectrum of counter-terror capabilities.\" According to sources, national security adviser Ajit Doval and other senior officials attended the meeting, where the Prime Minister was given a full overview of the security-related situation in the region and was apprised of the counter-terror efforts being undertaken in Jammu and Kashmir. Modi also spoke to Union home minister Amit Shah and discussed the deployment of security forces and counter-terror operations, government sources said. “Modi spoke to Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha as well and took stock of the situation in Union territory. Sinha briefed him on the efforts being undertaken by the local administration,” the sources further said. Meanwhile, the security forces have detained 50 people in connection with the probe into the recent terror attack on a bus carrying pilgrims in Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir, the UT police said on Thursday. The sources in the security setup also said that to hunt down the terrorists, the security forces have launched a massive search operation that has been expanded to the Reasi district's far-flung Arnas and Mahore regions to track down and neutralise the attackers at the earliest. The Arnas and Mahore areas in Reasi district were once terrorist hotbeds between 1995 and 2005, which were sanitised after successive operations in the past. In the last four days, the terrorists struck at four places in Reasi, Kathua and Doda districts of Jammu and Kashmir, killing nine pilgrims and a CRPF jawan and leaving seven security personnel and several others injured. So far, two suspected Pakistani terrorists were killed in an encounter with security forces in Kathua and a huge cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from them. The first terror strike was made on Sunday when they opened fire at a passenger bus carrying pilgrims en route to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Katra from the Shiv Khori temple. The bus ferrying pilgrims from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi fell into a deep gorge following gunfire, killing nine people and injuring 41 others. On Tuesday, terrorists fired at a joint checkpost of the 4 Rashtriya Rifles and police at Chattergalla in Bhaderwah, while a search party in the Gandoh area of the district was attacked on Wednesday, resulting in injuries to seven security personnel, including a policeman.",
