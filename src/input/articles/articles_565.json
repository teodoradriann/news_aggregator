    "text": "In the context of international integration, businesses are increasingly focusing on sustainable development and social responsibility, collective labor agreements (CLAs) have been playing an important role in building credibility with partners and winning trust of employees. At the same time, they serve as a bridge to build harmonious, stable, and progressive labor relations in the workplace.\nWhen policies on salary and welfare are guaranteed, employees will feel secure in their work. In the photo: Workers of Tokin Electronics Vietnam Co., Ltd. (Long Binh Ward) during working hours. Photo: Thao My |\nCollective labor agreements are not only legal tools but also bring double benefits in connecting the interests of employees and employers, aiming for sustainable production and stable employment.\nCreating stable labor relations\nAccording to the assessment of the Provincial Labor Federation, from the beginning of 2025 until now, labor relations in Dong Nai have been harmonious and stable. Workers feel secure in production, improve their skills, product quality, and actively participate in emulation movements at businesses. Contributing to such result is the good implementation of policies by businesses and the close touch of grassroots trade unions. Businesses proactively engage in dialogue, improve welfare, working environment, and increase income so that employees are committed and dedicated.\nRecent surveys by the Provincial Labor Federation on the operations of trade unions and labor and employment in businesses show that most of businesses are operating stably thanks to the good implementation of policies as committed in collective labor agreements.\nA typical example is Dong Phuong Co., Ltd. (in Binh Minh Commune), a business with over 9,000 employees (nearly 70% of them are female), where labor relations are very united and stable. The business owner is concerned with creating all conditions for the trade union to operate effectively, implementing many models in caring for the material and spiritual lives of employees.\nAs for the collective labor agreement signed by Dong Phuong Co., Ltd. with the grassroots trade union, benefits have been increased beyond what is stipulated by law. Specifically, for pregnant female workers, the company is not allowed to arrange them to operate cutting machines or come into contact with chemicals that affect reproductive function and childcare. Cases of paid leave as regulated, such as marriage, female workers taking regular prenatal check-ups, and husbands taking leave for their wives' childbirth, are not subject to production bonus deductions. The company provides a breast milk expression and storage room and arranges a separate parking area for pregnant female workers.\nAccording to Le Tran Khanh Son, Chairman of the grassroots Trade Union of Dong Phuong Co., Ltd., in addition to organizing dialogues and listening to the workers’ thoughts through conferences, the collective labour agreements serve as an important key to harmonizing the interests of employees and businesses. Not only do they protect employee rights, but the collective labour agreements also help businesses stabilize production, enhance competitiveness, and build a responsible brand. The effective development, signing, and implementation of collective labour agreements are proof of harmonious, progressive development and the building of a committed and dedicated workforce.\nIn reality, in businesses with quality collective labour agreements, the relationship between the business owner and employees is always stable.\nDang Thi Hoang Lan, Chairwoman of the Trade Union of Wacoal Vietnam Co., Ltd. (Amata Industrial Park, Long Binh Ward), said: Since the collective labour agreement was signed and supplemented, employees in the company have enjoyed many additional benefits regarding salary, bonuses, rest time, increased lunch meal value, position bonuses, and annual vacation trips for employees, etc.\n\"When employees' rights are guaranteed, they will have a positive working attitude and feel secure in long-term commitment to the business. Thus, it helps businesses improve productivity and product quality, reduce recruitment and retraining costs, and improve the business's reputation and image in the labor market,\" Dang Thi Hoang Lan shared.\nHelping businesses maintain stable production\nThe collective labour agreements are negotiated and signed between the grassroots Trade Union executive committee and the employer, reflecting consensus on working conditions such as: wages, working hours, rest regulations, welfare, occupational safety and health, living support, etc. In particular, a signed collective labour agreement brings \"dual\" benefits to both employees and businesses. For employees, it helps ensure better rights than those stipulated by law. For businesses, it enhances reputation and improves production and business efficiency.\nThe collective labour agreements are testaments to a sustainable working environment, contributing to increasing the international cooperation capabilities of businesses. In addition, it increases stability, transparency, and creates safe working conditions for employees. When businesses effectively implement the regulations and policies as committed, it will reduce the risk of labor disputes, create more credibility for businesses in the international market, and build trust among employees.\nThe Provincial Labor Federation stated: In the first 6 months of 2025, grassroots trade unions participated in negotiating and signing 35 new collective labour agreements, achieving nearly 44% of the target assigned by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor. In addition, 218 agreements were re-signed, amended, and supplemented, bringing the total number of collective labour agreements in the province to 1,384 out of 1,689 grassroots trade unions eligible under the law to be negotiated and signed by trade unions. Thanks to this, employees are not only legally protected but also have improved living and working conditions, reducing worries about income and social security.\nVu Hoang Mong Cuong, Chairman of the Trade Union of Shingmark Vina Co., Ltd. (in An Vien commune), said: The entire company currently has nearly 4,000 employees. In 2023, the grassroots trade union was selected by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor as a pilot for dialogue with businesses on representing, caring for, and protecting the rights and interests of female workers at the workplace. After the dialogue, the business agreed to sign 5 contents beneficial to employees, such as: providing periodic gynecological examination once a year; improving lunch meals from 18,000 VND to 25,000 VND/meal for pregnant female workers and those with children under 12-month old; increasing childcare support from 50,000 VND to 80,000 VND.\nIn addition, the business supports 1 million VND/person for female workers giving birth and arranges a separate parking area for pregnant employees.\n\"Whether the signed agreement has many or few benefits depends on the skill and ingenuity of the Trade Union officials in negotiating with the business owner. If the Trade Union knows how to choose the right time to negotiate and propose long-term benefits, the business will certainly agree, and employees will enjoy many better policies,\" Vu Hoang Mong Cuong shared.\nBy Thao My/Translated by Van Nga - Thu Ha",

    "text": "[Baloncesto](/deportes/baloncesto/) Pendents de la preinscripció del Morabanc Andorra a la Basketball Champions La FIBA confirmarà la setmana vinent quins clubs jugaran la fase prèvia El club tricolor té l'oportunitat de formar part de la tercera competició del bàsquet europeu. Demà és l'últim dia per formalitzar la petició a la FIBA i el Morabanc valorarà fins a última hora la possibilitat de participar en la Basketball Champions. El principal inconvenient és el motiu econòmic, ja que l'entitat ha de calcular si veritablement li surt rendible tenint en compte les importants despeses dels viatges. De tota manera, el Morabanc mai ha disputat aquesta competició a diferència d'altres rivals de la Lliga Endesa com Lenovo Tenerife, el Baxi Manresa, l'UCAM Múrcia o l'actual campió l'Unicaja Màlaga. L'opció de l'Eurocup sembla difícil per la quantitat d'equips que hi participaran i que tenen una millor classificació en cadascuna de les lligues domèstiques; encara que el club no descarta fer la inscripció. Tanmateix, si el Morabanc vol tornar a jugar a Europa després de tres temporades, ho haurà de fer per la via de la Basketball Champions. Un dels conjunts que sí que ha sol·licitat poder competir tant en BCL com Eurocup és el Bàsquet Girona, ho va anunciar aquesta setmana la CEO del club Stefi Batlle. Un fet significatiu perquè el Morabanc ha quedat per sobre del Girona a la classificació i teòricament tindria prioritat. En qualsevol cas, la pròxima setmana s'anunciaran els equips que disputaran la fase prèvia de la BCL. Natxo Lezkano, entrenador de Costa d'Ivori al Preolímpic El tècnic del Morabanc Andorra dirigirà per uns dies a la selecció africana en el torneig previ a París 2024. D'aquesta manera, Lezkano intentarà aconseguir una de les places encara disponibles per als Jocs en un grup amb Lituània i Mèxic. Els partits classificatoris es disputaran entre el 2 i el 7 de juliol. Carles Rosell Periodista a Ràdio SER Principat d’Andorra. Conductor de l’Aquí Esports, col·laborador de Carrusel i...",

    "text": "El legendario Lee Iacocca, expresidente de Ford Motor Company y uno de los personajes más representativos de la industria del automóvil de finales del siglo XX, fue la persona que estuvo detrás de modelos tan genuinos como el Ford Mustang o el Ford Escort y, cómo no, del Bronco.\nIacocca dio el visto bueno, en febrero de 1964, al innovador diseño todoterreno de Paul G. Axelrad para que pasara inmediatamente a producción. Así, en 1966 nació el Bronco. Un modelo que aterrizaba en el mercado para competir, entre otros, contra el Jeep CJ-5 y el Toyota Land Cruiser J40.\nDurante 30 años y hasta 1996, el Ford Bronco se ofreció con diferentes acabados. Desde la carrocería Roaster (descapotable), hasta la Wagon (larga), pasando por la Sport Utility (\npick-up) se consagró durante cinco generaciones como uno de los mejores vehículos para todo de los Estados Unidos.\nMás información\nRetrofit de alta gama\nLa sexta generación del\nBronco se lanzó en 2021, tras 25 años de travesía por el desierto. Sin embargo, a pesar de la buena acogida de la prensa especializada y del público (el modelo fue elegido Coche de los Lectores en los premios del motor de PRISA Media), hay muchos amantes de los vehículos 4×4 que siguen echando de menos al modelo primigenio. Para ellos, el retrofit (modernizar un vehículo usado con componentes actuales) es la mejor solución.\nLa demanda de actual de las unidades de los sesenta, setenta y ochenta está disparada en el mercado de segunda mano. Por ello, la compañía estadounidense\nKindred Motorworks se propuso construir los Ford Broncos clásicos que combinan la nostalgia, el diseño atemporal y el carácter del pasado con la seguridad, la fiabilidad y el rendimiento de hoy en día.\nEl fundador, Rob Howard, lidera el equipo de expertos que emplean la tecnología patentada de Kindred que agiliza y estandariza el proceso de restauración de vehículos para crear clásicos modernos que sean atractivos, confiables y divertidos. Desde principios de año, 20 unidades del Bronco han llegado a las instalaciones de la compañía.\nRestauración de un Ford Bronco\nEl equipo de Kindred Motorworks necesita alrededor de 1.700 horas de mano de obra para llevar a cabo meticulosamente el proceso de\nrestauración de principio a fin de un Ford Bronco. Para ello, su área de trabajo se divide en cuatro zonas bien diferenciadas:\n- Desmontaje: en esta área, los técnicos de Kindred Motorworks de desmontarlo completamente en menos de cuatro horas.\n- Fabricación de metal: en esta estación sueldan, cortan, doblan y fresan los paneles de\nchapay los componentes clave para el ensamblaje.\n- Pintura: después de una exhaustiva preparación, las\ncarroceríasde los vehículos se pintan con el color seleccionado por el cliente.\n- Montaje: el chasis, que ha sido previamente rociado con un recubrimiento en polvo para una mayor durabilidad, se une con la carrocería recién pintada, con el tren motriz, la\nsuspensióny los componentes interiores.\nEspecificaciones técnicas\nLas unidades que se restauran en la factoría de Kindred Motorworks son las comprendidas entre los años 1966 y 1975. Aunque mantienen la estética clásica, se mejoran en todos los demás apartados para que sea perfectamente utilizable en el día a día.\nEl motor es un Ford Coyote V8 de 5.0 litros que genera 465 CV, aunque la compañía está desarrollando un\nsistema de propulsión eléctrico que los clientes pueden pedir como opción alternativa. Este propulsor, sin emisiones, tiene el objetivo de ofrecer una autonomía eléctrica de unos 320 kilómetros.\nPor su parte, la potencia está controlada por una transmisión automática de 10 velocidades. Así mismo, todos montan suspensiones mejoradas, frenos de disco en las cuatro ruedas, modernos neumáticos BF Goodrich de 33 pulgadas, barras antivuelco de seis puntos,\nluces led en ambos ejes y cámara de visión trasera. Todo este derroche de tecnología actual no es barato, ya que sus precios comienzan en los 154.000 euros y llegan hasta los 205.000 euros al cambio.\nSigue toda la información de EL MOTOR desde\nSobre la firma\nRubén Pérez []https://twitter.com/xruben []https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubénpérez/\nEntusiasta del motor en toda su magnitud, preferiblemente los V12.

The morning drizzle added to the joyous and affectionate atmosphere as he spent time among the cattle and children. Despite his busy schedule due to the two-month long Lok Sabha elections, the CM frequently visited the Gorakhnath Temple, offering prayers, performing gauseva and interacting with children, his office said. Yogi, who is also Goraksha Peethadheeshwar has been staying at Gorakhnath Temple since Friday evening. His Sunday routine was traditional. After offering prayers to Lord Shiva and Guru Gorakhnath he visited the statue of Mahant Avaidyanath to seek his blessings. Afterwards, as usual, he went on a tour of the temple premises. While walking around, he noticed children who had come with their families. CM Yogi affectionately patted them and showered blessings. The children appeared to enjoy the company of the CM amid the drizzle. CM Yogi also visited the cowshed (goshala) to perform gauseva. He called the cows by their names, Shyama, Gauri, Nandi, and Bhola and affectionately fed them jaggery. UNI AB INGTags: #Yogi offers prayers at Gorakhnath temple",

The total number of people losing their lives in this year&#039;s flood, landslide and storm stands at 39. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said at least 50 large ponds should be created in the northeast region to divert water of the Brahmaputra river to help tackle floods and develop agriculture, irrigation and tourism. Chairing a review meeting in Delhi on preparedness for flood management during the monsoon, Shah also emphasised on optimum use of satellite imagery provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for flood and water management. Reacting to the suggestions, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the high-level review meeting sets the tone for further flood management and ensures that the administration moves forward with a &#039;Zero Casualty Approach&#039;. &quot;Creating large ponds to divert floodwater from Brahmaputra, as discussed in the meet, will aid in multiple ways- reduce impact of floods, boost tourism and recharge water levels in the area,&quot; Sarma said in a post on X. Regarding the ongoing flood situation in the state, he said the government is committed to tackling the impact of the deluge effectively and the entire administration is on alert. The administration has been operating 211 relief camps and relief distribution centres in 10 districts, where 79,325 people have taken shelter at present, according to the official bulletin. The authorities have distributed 1,110.11 quintals of rice, 206.43 quintals of dal, 61.95 quintals of salt and 6,194.48 litres of mustard oil among the flood victims of the state during the last 24 hours. At present, people of 810 villages are reeling under floodwater and 4,274.13 hectares of crop areas have been damaged across Assam, the ASDMA said. Embankments, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have been damaged by floodwater in Darrang, Kamrup and Bajali. The Kushiyara river at Karimganj town is flowing above the danger mark, the ASDMA said. On account of widespread flooding, over 1,70,495 domestic animals and poultry are affected across the state.

    "text": "Ese país está en una carrera contra el tiempo para completar la transformación de Gaza en una fosa común, advirtió en un comunicado la entidad.\nLa Cancillería criticó la estrategia del primer ministro Benjamin Netanyahu, a quien acusó de jactarse por la muerte de la población palestina en ese enclave costero.\nAl respecto, cuestionó la estrategia de la vecina nación de privar a los gazatíes de alimentos, agua, medicinas, combustible y otros productos de primera necesidad, lo cual afecta en mayor medida a mujeres, niños y ancianos.\nCualesquiera que sean los objetivos declarados de Netanyahu en esta guerra, el resultado que revela sus verdaderas intenciones son el genocidio diario y la limpieza étnica, recalcó.\nEl Ministerio acusó a Israel de hacer caso omiso de la postura de la ONU y de la comunidad internacional.\nEse Gobierno sabotea cualquier esfuerzo global para detener las hostilidades contra nuestro pueblo, afirmó.\nDetener el conflicto de inmediato es la única y correcta forma de proteger a los civiles y garantizar sus necesidades básicas, concluyó la Cancillería.\nmem/rob",
