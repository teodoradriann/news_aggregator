    "text": "Mumbai: Renowned Bollywood actor, Suniel Shetty has not only captivated audiences with his powerful acting but his fitness is an inspiration to many people above 50. The actor&apos;s stylish appearances and active presence on social media have left his fans in awe. The 62-year-old actor maintains his fitness through a diet plan and conscious lifestyle choices. Let&apos;s take motivation from his dietary habits and lifestyle, to stay fit.\nIn his interviews, he talked about his diet secrets. Let&apos;s dive into Suniel Shetty&apos;s meal plans.\nSuniel Shetty&apos;s Diet Plan\nHe revealed that he keeps a count of his calories for whatever he eats and balances his meals according to body requirements. Egg is a rich source of animal-based protein, Anna eats 4-5 egg whites for breakfast as egg whites are abundant in protein and egg yolk in fats. He prefers eating simple food for his lunch and dinner. He consumes nutritious ragi roti, dal, and sabji, or meat. During the evening, he opts for a chicken soup or broth. He loves sweet potatoes which are good for our immune system besides various other health benefits and that too are a part of his snacks.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Suniel Shetty (@suniel.shetty)\n\\n While these were the DOS, let&apos;s talk about DONT&apos;S. He restricts himself from eating all types of white foods for healthy living such as sugar, rice, milk, paneer, and other white foods. He doesn&apos;t support protein supplements. He admitted in his interview that he tried them but realised they weren&apos;t good for his body so he stopped taking them. He therefore depends on natural protein sources for a balanced diet and body requirements.\nSuniel Shetty&apos;s Lifestyle Choices\nHis lifestyle choices include going to bed by 10:30 p.m. as he prefers getting up early which has its advantages. He wakes up at 5 am daily, allowing himself four to five hours of personal time before diving into work. He allocates this time to yoga and breathing exercises which are essential for mental clarity and peace.\nHe has earlier emphasised in his interviews, the importance of a strict routine, mentioning that he always eats meals at set times- lunch at one and dinner at seven and prefers to have homemade food.\nHe also mentioned that he hits the gym without his phone, spends quality time with his family, including his mother, wife, and children, and plays with his pets.\nSuniel Shetty believes his routine is the cornerstone of his good health and optimistic outlook on life, enabling him to take control of his time and shape his schedule.",

    "text": "LANSING — A snowfall that caused sloppy road conditions in the Lansing region on Friday morning was expected to continue into the afternoon and evening hours, making for a potentially slippery evening commute, forecasters said. A winter weather advisory was in effect until midnight Friday for much of west and mid-Michigan. Snow was spreading \"rapidly\" across the state by about 4 a.m., and the National Weather Service warned that some areas could see up to 8 inches on Friday. It was still snowing steadily in Lansing during the early afternoon hours. The forecast changed only slightly during the day, with total expected accumulations of 3 to 5 inches in the Lansing area, meteorologist Scott Thomas said. Some areas that fall under heavier bands of snow could get a little more than that, he added. Following a relatively mild winter, drivers need to remember they should slow down in snowy conditions, Thomas said. \"It never hurts to plan a little extra time on their drive,\" he said. Most of the snow later on Friday was expected to be focused along a belt between Interstate 96 and M-46, the weather service said. The weather service said snow was already accumulating on roads along the Lake Michigan shoreline as early as 4 a.m. The storm was moving eastward across the state, with 4 to 8 inches possible in an area generally outlined by Grand Rapids, Alma and Flint. Lansing was expected to see 4 to 6 inches of snow. Temperatures were expected to rise into the mid-30s on Friday and into the high-30s over the weekend. Things should dry out over the weekend before rain moves in on Monday night, the weather service said. Temperatures could climb into the mid-50s on Monday and Tuesday before falling back into the mid-40s later next week, it said.",

    "text": "OAKLAND — Garrett County has a wealth of scenic destinations nestled within its hills and mountains, ranging from the historically significant to the naturally beautiful, from town centers to wooded seclusion. Swallow Falls North of Oakland, Swallow Falls State Park is home to some of Maryland’s most breathtaking scenery and several waterfalls. The Youghiogheny River flows into the park, passing through shaded rocky gorges and creating small rapids. The river rolls over Tolliver Falls and Upper and Lower Swallow Falls. Facing the lower falls, Muddy Creek joins the Youghiogheny after plunging 53 feet. A 1.25-mile trail through the park guides hikers past the water and through tall hemlocks. From downtown Oakland, travel on Liberty Street until it becomes Herrington Manor Road. The park is nine miles north of town. Casselman River Bridge The Casselman River Bridge near Grantsville is an 80-foot span erected in 1813. At the time, it was the longest single-span stone arch bridge in the United States. It served as an important link on the National Road through 1933. Although it no longer carries vehicular traffic, it is open to pedestrians. Casselman River Bridge State Park is a four-acre parcel, popular for picnicking, fly fishing and photography. From I-68, take Exit 19 at Grantsville and drive to U.S. 40 Alternate/Main Street. The bridge is one mile to the east. Museum triangle The downtown Oakland area features a trio of museums: The Garrett County Historical Museum, the Garrett County Museum of Transportation and the Oakland B&O Museum. The former railroad station is a favorite spot for outdoor portrait photography. The 1884 building is considered to be one of the best examples of the Queen Anne style used in many of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad stations. In front of the station is a full-sized display of railway history. In 2018, a restored 1920 Baldwin steam locomotive and tender were added to the caboose and boxcar. The station is located on Liberty Street in Oakland, with the transportation museum across the street and the historical museum at the nearby intersection. Barn quilts Visitors to Garrett County can explore its scenic beauty, pastoral communities and rich farming heritage any time of the year by following the Barn Quilt Trail — which now boasts 45 colorful creations. The “quilts” are not actually made of fabric. Instead, colorful traditional and original quilt block designs are painted on 8-foot-by-8-foot (or smaller) pieces of aluminum composite material and mounted with screws on the sides of barns. Each structure showcases one quilt square or “block.” Quilt enthusiasts will recognize such well-known designs as Rose of Sharon, Double Wedding Ring, Turkey Tracks, Flying Geese and Log Cabin. Details about the barn quilt blocks and a map of the trail can be found at [garrettbarnquilts.org](http://garrettbarnquilts.org). Deep Creek Lake The heart of tourism in Garrett County, Deep Creek Lake features retail and dining establishments and rental units. Boating and fishing are part of the available outdoor activities. The man-made lake covers approximately 3,900 acres and has 69 miles of shoreline. Its depths contain yellow perch, walleye, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass. Motorized and non-motorized vessels, as well as personal watercraft, are permitted. Deep Creek Lake is easily accessible by taking Exit 14 from I-68 to U.S. 219 and traveling south for 17 miles. Highest point in Maryland The eastern edge of the state meets the Atlantic Ocean at sea level, but the western end contains the highest point in Maryland at an elevation of 3,360 feet. Hoye-Crest is a summit along Backbone Mountain just inside Garrett County, providing a view of the North Branch Potomac River Valley. There is no vehicular access, but the Maryland High Point Trail starts at U.S. 219 just south of Silver Lake, W.Va. The trail ascends the mountain for a mile along an old logging road through the Monongahela National Forest to the state line. The trail then heads north along the state line to the high point. The crest is on private property, but access is permitted. Oakland murals Art can be seen in a big way in downtown Oakland with several murals that have been painted on the sides of buildings. Each highlights a facet of the local community — history, commerce, transportation and safety. On the rear of the Garrett County Museum of Transportation on East Liberty Street is a collection of post-card-style pictures commemorating life in different areas of Garrett County, such as Mountain Lake Park, Deer Park and Deep Creek Lake. In the parking lot beside the Oakland Volunteer Fire Department on South Third Street is a strip in the style of Roy Lichtenstein in tribute to public safety. At the rear of The Garrett County Republican newspaper office on East Green Street is a display of B&O Railroad history centered on a portrait of John W. Garrett, the railroad’s president during its pre-Civil War construction. Facing that mural across the parking lot is another featuring famous visitors to the county, including Albert Einstein, Buffalo Bill Cody and the “Vagabonds” trip of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Harvey Firestone. State forests State forest land is available in Garrett County for outdoor recreation, from hiking to fishing. Potomac Garrett State Forest is 10,488 acres in the southeastern corner off Md. 135. Garrett State Forest is 8,144 acres located five miles northwest of Oakland along U.S. 219. In the central and eastern parts of the county, the Savage River State Forest has 55,155 acres generally south of U.S. 40 and surrounding the Savage River Reservoir. These forests contain a wide variety of trees, plentiful wildlife and breathtaking scenery.",

    "title": "#20 Sánchez celebra la salida de Vox de gobiernos autonómicos: \"Es un gran día para España\"",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nAl final el gobierno frankenstein, el que iba a reventar por un lado u otro, ahí sigue. Y mientras el PP teniendo que lidiar con una panda de paletos vociferantes como aliados, y ahora además con una escisión aún más paleta y aún más vociferante.\nPues voy a hacer de abogado del diablo. Lo primero de todo es que avisaron de salirse de los gobiernos si se cumplía lo del reparto de menores...y han cumplido. Seguramente si hubieran reculado ya estaríamos con el mantra de los sillones y las poltronas.\nSe está celebrando el reparto, cuando seguimos sin atajar el problema. Muchos de ellos no son menores, no tenemos información alguna suya previa y por mucho que digamos donde deberían estar es con sus familias.\nSupongo que desde la perspectiva de la \"izquierda\" esto es una fiesta. Pero no todo el mundo piensa igual y esto es un problema que ni los políticos de izquierda o derecha se van a comer en sus barrios y casas.\nLuego vendrán los sesudos análisis del auge de la ultra derecha.\nY bueno, ahora ya podéis tildarme de fascista o lo que os salga de las pelotas por no seguir el ideario estándar de la izquierda.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Es el asunto del tonto, el dedo y la luna. Pero ya sabemos que eso en la izquierda no ocurre. Somos moralmente superiores.\n[#6](c6#c-6) los menores (y mayores) van a seguir viniendo a España le guste a quien le guste. Salvo que pongas a la armada a disparar a los cayucos como proponen estos neandertales.\nPuedes hacer dos cosas:\n1) ayudar a África para que no vengan\n2) aprovechar que vienen y darles una educación y una salida laboral\nA mí me vale cualquiera de las dos. Lo que me parece inaceptable y estúpido es usar la inmigración como un arma electoral.\n[#6](c6#c-6) El problema es el mismo de siempre. Si omites las guerras que provocamos, la inmigración estaría en mismas cifras que en 2018.\nEl problema, de ser ese y no la natalidad, pero no voy a entrar en eso. Ese supuesto problema no se ataja con antorchas en casas de acogida de niños, ni despotricando, ni siquiera ahogando los con balas de goma cuando cruzan la frontera nadando.\nSe arregla con política, relaciones con marruecos y negociación. Es la única forma. No con pirados con antorchas.\nUna vez se cruza la frontera, si no sabes a donde deportarlos, debes cumplir con los derechos humanos y respetar la dignidad de las personas.\nPq no te olvides que aunque musulmanes y negros, son seres humanos cuyo delito principal es querer buscarse la vida.\n[#1](c1#c-1) son unos sinvergüenzas. Ellos y los que los apoyan. Mucho marketing, pero ahí seguimos apoyando el belicismo OTAN.\nNi las autonómicas ni las europeas contaron con mi voto.\nSi se piensan que se van a mantener con el \"que vienen los fachas\" y seguir apoyando los genocidios de ucrania y palestina van de puto culo.\nTeniendo en cuenta el contexto, que vox es un partido de gente que ha demostrado tener poca capacidad de gestionar, que es un partido para hacer ruido en la oposición más que para gobernar (igual que podemos en este punto), y que esta crisis de los menores no es ni de lejos representativo del problema inmigratorio.\nPero hay que reconocer que esto es un gesto de honestidad que no recordamos en la política española. Renunciar a poltronas porque se han incumplido puntos que eran importantes para ellos desde el punto de vista de programa. Sobre cualquier otro partido (desde el PP a indepes o el psoe) hay cientos de ejemplos de lo contrario, de aferrarse al sillón y capear las preguntas con una desvergüenza acojonante.\n[#10](c10#c-10)\nLa intolerancia no es algo positivo.\nCuando tu negocias un gobierno y más si eres una minoría estás obligado a aceptar cosas que no vienen en tu programa. Se llama negociar.\nTodo por repartirse 300-400 niños entre 44 millones de españoles, niños que ya están en España (sí, Canarias, señor Abascal, es España y hay que ser solidaria con ella, que también hay españoles allí) y cosa que lleva haciéndose cada año. Ultra\"católicos\" negando el auxilio a niños. VAYA VAYA.\nEs que no dan para más. Ni honor ni pollas, es que son tontos. El \"honor\" es para las batallas, no para la política.\nMe arremango el fajín y apurandome el Cinzano promulgo:\n-Hay un movimiento divertido en la derecha, al crecer Vox, el PP se vio obligado a endurecer sus posturas mas escoradas para intentar recuperar los votos del ala mas reaccionaria que se iban desangrando pa Vox, eso es lo que vimos estos años, un \"a ver quien dice la idiotez mas gorda\". Esta semana asistimos a una nueva dinámica encabezada por el follaardillas, Vox ha visto como le crece un enano por la derecha, no puede permitirlo, o sea q se enfurruñan y se cierran en banda haciendo bandera de... pos algo tan propagandistico y de impacto entre el electorado mas ultra como los MENAS...

Recuerdas cuánto estuvo Rajoy sin presupuestos? Gracias a eso el hundimiento de España se relajo esos últimos años de gobierno de la trotona, que no pudo robar todo lo que quiso como había hecho con la sareb.\nEra para\n#_13 que tiene estrabismo intelectual y los dos ojos le miran para el mismo lado.",
