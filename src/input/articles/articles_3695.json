    "text": "Veja quais jogadores já deixaram o Verdão em 2025 e quem será o próximo a sair.\nO Palmeiras tem acertado saídas de seu elenco neste início de temporada. Dudu foi o primeiro a deixar o clube. O ex-camisa 7 rescindiu seu contrato e assinou com o Cruzeiro.\nA movimentação da vez no Palmeiras acontece na defesa. Depois de negociar a transferência de Vitor Reis ao Manchester City, da Inglaterra, o Verdão está negociando outro zagueiro do time de Abel Ferreira.\nPalmeiras encaminha empréstimo do zagueiro Michel\nO Palmeiras tem negociações avançadas para emprestar o zagueiro Michel ao Moreirense, de Portugal. A informação foi publicada inicialmente pelo portal ‘Nosso Palestra’.\nO empréstimo do jogador de 21 anos será válido por 18 meses. Segundo o portal, o acordo terá uma opção de compra fixada no término do vínculo – já segundo o ‘UOL’, não terá.\nFato é que Michel não está nos planos de Abel Ferreira, que o utilizou apenas cinco vezes – todas em 2021. O atleta esteve na mira do Juventude e do Talleres, da Argentina.\nO técnico palmeirense agora conta com quatro zagueiros em seu elenco: Murilo, Gustavo Gómez, Naves e Benedetti. Vitor Reis entra na lista de saídas do Palmeiras em 2025. Veja abaixo!\nQuantos jogadores saíram do Palmeiras em 2025\nAlém de Michel, o Palmeiras acertou mais seis saídas de seu elenco. O último seria Rony, mas a transferência do atacante ao Catar melou.\nDudu, como citado, foi o primeiro a sair do Verdão. Lázaro, que não teve seu empréstimo renovado e voltou para o Almería, da Espanha, foi o segundo.\nEm seguida, Gabriel Menino foi envolvido na negociação para contratar Paulinho, do Atlético-MG. Zé Rafael, buscando novos ares e mais espaço em 2025, está fechando com o Santos.\n- LEIA MAIS:\nRelembre os últimos camisas 10 do Palmeiras\nEntre as saídas, apenas Vitor Reis estava realmente nos planos do Palmeiras para atual temporada. Mas o zagueiro foi negociado com o Manchester City, da Inglaterra, por 35 milhões de euros (R$ 219 milhões).\nAtuesta, meio-campista colombiano que voltou de empréstimo dos Estados Unidos, ainda tem o seu futuro incerto no Verdão. Abel Ferreira tem dado oportunidade para o meia se provar. A diretoria palmeirense não descarta uma nova negociação.",

    "title": "Group calls for shift to ‘circular’ economy | Jonathan L. Mayuga",
    "text": "A NONPROFIT organization on Thursday called for urgent action to shift from linear, to “circular” economy through community-led action, inclusive partnerships, and innovative solutions to plastic waste and marine litter. Compared to a linear economy, which is essentially an economy in which finite resources are extracted to make products that are used not to their full potential and then thrown away, a “circular economy” is a resource production and consumption model that involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible. Essentially, it means extending the life cycle of a product—including packaging. The pitch was made by Antoinette Taus, founder and executive director of the group Communities Organized for Resource Allocation (Cora) during a recently concluded international conference dubbed “SEA of Solutions 2024: Delivering actions to end plastic pollution” conference, which was held at the United Nations Conference Center in Bangkok, Thailand, last month. “We must ensure a just transition as we strengthen circular economy solutions to #BeatPlasticPollution. Our oceans, communities, and children depend on it. We have witnessed firsthand the powerful force of local communities in the Philippines, especially women and youth, in driving sustainable solutions. But we need greater collaboration to scale these efforts to tackle the problem at the source,” Taus said in a statement. Taus said a circular economy plays a crucial role in addressing the pressing issue of plastic pollution, particularly in coastal areas. Landfills and marine environments are often the final destination for discarded plastics, posing a grave threat to precious ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. A study by the World Bank revealed that the Philippines discards a staggering 163 million sachets, 48 million plastic bags, and three million diapers daily. The latest findings from the 2023 Rapid Assessment Standing Stock Survey carried out by Cora at the Las Piñas-Parañaque Wetland Park revealed that food wrappers and sachets constitute the predominant type of marine litter, comprising 33 percent of the total waste collected. This alarming statistic is closely followed by plastic bottles, accounting for 15 percent of the accumulated waste. “Plastic pollution threatens ecosystems and both marine and human life. By advancing a circular economy, we minimize waste and pollution by creating closed-loop systems where materials are reused, recycled or regenerated,” Taus added. Jonathan L.

Largest storm in 30 years The storm was the [largest one](/en/extreme-weather/t-19020379) to hit Taiwan in nearly 30 years. It caused two deaths and disrupted transport on the island before moving towards the [Chinese](/en/china/t-18480887) coast. It caused more than 1.2 meters (3.9 feet) of rainfall in the eastern mountains and winds of above 130 kilometers per hour (80 miles per hour) in the Taipei metropolitan area. \"There are four reported cases of flooding and all have receded. There are also three reported cases of mudslides, including one near a tunnel, which we are verifying now,\" an official told AFP news agency. Kong-rey lost strength but still remained a severe tropical storm as it reached the Taiwan Strait. It brought heavy rains and winds to China's Fujian province but is not expected to make landfall there. It will likely move into the open sea towards Japan later on Friday. \"The typhoon was so strong yesterday, The trees over there at the elementary school were uprooted. The big banyan tree was uprooted,\" restaurant owner Pan Li-chu told AFP. The fast-moving typhoon made landfall on the sparsely populated east coast on Thursday at 1:40 pm (0540 GMT), Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration (CWA) said. It moved from central Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait before traveling north. What was the human cost of Typhoon Kong-rey in Taiwan? One person was killed by a falling tree and the other was killed after being hit by an electrical pole, Taiwanese authorities said. More than 500 injuries were reported. About 11,500 people were evacuated due to risk of landslides. About 2000 trees and hundreds of street signs were knocked down due to the winds. Two Czech hikers had to be rescued from the Taroko National Park in Hualien County in Taiwan's east. The north-south high speed rail link resumed operations by Friday, but 57 international and 135 domestic flights were canceled. Since July, this is the third typhoon to hit Taiwan.[Typhoon Gaemi](/en/typhoon-gaemi-hits-china-after-cargo-ship-sinks-in-taiwan/a-69747440) killed at least 10, and caused flooding in southern Taiwan.

    "text": "O sucesso da série televisiva “Shōgun” ajudou a aguçar o apetite dos estúdios internacionais por conteúdo japonês de qualidade e os criadores nipónicos estão a preparar-se para responder a essa procura.\nOs fãs de mangas e animes japoneses costumam criticar as adaptações estrangeiras pela falta de fidelidade ao material original.\nMas “Shōgun”, disponível no Disney+ e baseado no romance de 1975 do escritor australiano-britânico James Clavell, quebrou os padrões com uma produção falada principalmente em japonês e elogiada pela sua autenticidade.\nEm setembro, ganhou 18 Emmys, os principais prémios da televisão americana.\n\"Shōgun\" Outras produções japonesas recentes também se tornaram sucessos globais.\nO programa franco-americano-japonês “Les Gouttes de Dieu/Drops of God”, baseado na manga de mesmo nome e que pode ser vista na Apple TV+, ganhou o prémio de Melhor Drama nos International Emmy Awards em novembro.\nA série “One Piece”, da Netflix, de 2023, adaptação de uma manga com o ator mexicano Iñaki Godoy, foi aplaudida pelo público e pela crítica e já se prepara uma segunda temporada.\nExistem outras adaptações de mangas e animes conhecidas em marcha, incluindo “My Hero Academia” e as aventuras ninja de “Naruto”.\n“A procura dos mercados ocidentais está claramente a crescer”, disse à agência France-Presse Kaori Ikeda, presidente executiva da TIFFCOM, a feira de conteúdo afiliada ao Festival Internacional de Cinema de Tóquio.\nEsta responsável alerta, no entanto, que as empresas japonesas carecem de experiência em temas como a negociação de direitos.\nPor esta razão, a TIFFCOM organizou o Tokyo Story Market, um espaço para facilitar os contactos entre produtores internacionais e editores japoneses.\nBranqueamento\n\"Ghost in the Shell – Agente do Futuro\" Os estúdios estrangeiros também aprimoraram as suas adaptações, evitando alguns erros cometidos no passado, como a versão cinematográfica de 2017 da manga “Ghost in the Shell” com Scarlett Johansson.\nOs críticos acusaram o filme de “branqueamento” porque as suas personagens principais eram atores não japoneses, com exceção de Takeshi Kitano.\nDa mesma forma, o 'thriller' sobrenatural da Netflix “Death Note” (2017) foi criticado pela sua falta de apego à manga original.\n“Os autores de manga são muito respeitados e os seus fãs muito atenciosos”, diz Klaus Zimmermann, produtor de “Drops of God”.\nA sua adaptação toma algumas liberdades, como incluir um ator francês como personagem principal, mas Zimmermann insiste que foi desenvolvida em conjunto com os autores da manga original.\n“Tratava-se de encontrar o espírito da manga para não distorcê-la”, diz.\nYuki Takamatsu, negociador de direitos da editora de manga Kodansha, diz que o processo de adaptação de “Drops of God” foi “incrível”.\n“Todos estavam disponíveis para enfrentar os desafios juntos (...) Todos percebiam a cada passo como fazê-lo”, afirma.\n\"Drops of God\" Os fracassos do passado devem-se em parte às dificuldades das editoras em comunicar os seus desejos aos produtores estrangeiros, que não têm um conhecimento adequado de manga e anime, segundo Takamatsu.\n“Mas hoje em dia, especialmente após a COVID-19, os produtores na faixa dos 30 ou 40 anos veem animes com os filhos na Netflix ou na Amazon” e entram em contacto connosco, afirma.\nA globalização da TV japonesa A televisão japonesa também melhorou na “apresentação e comercialização do seu conteúdo” no exterior, diz Makito Sugiyama, diretor executivo da Associação de Exportação de Programas de Televisão do Japão (BEAJ).\nIsto inclui a participação em eventos globais como no MIPCOM em Cannes, a maior feira mundial da indústria televisiva, diz Sugiyama.\nOs canais de televisão japoneses conseguiram vender com sucesso conceitos de programas no exterior, como aquele que originou no final dos anos 1980 o “America’s Funniest Home Videos” [programa baseado em vídeos caseiros de humor enviados pelos espectadores].\nAgora, alguns dramas japoneses também estão a encontrar maior ressonância internacional.\nO drama “Mother”, da Nippon TV, teve sucesso em grande parte devido à sua versão turca e foi transmitido em cerca de 50 países.\nO público ocidental superou a relutância inicial em relação a séries com atores asiáticos, diz Masaru Akiyama, executivo da BEAJ.\n“Habituaram-se, já não se importam. Querem ver, querem sentir as histórias”, acrescenta.\n“Shōgun” 'mudou as coisas para o Japão', afirma.\nA diretora da TIFFCOM, Kaori Ikeda, concorda com a importância desta série.\n“O facto de uma história de samurais com tanta atenção aos detalhes históricos se poder tornar entretenimento de massa prova o potencial” dos conteúdos japoneses, afirma.",
