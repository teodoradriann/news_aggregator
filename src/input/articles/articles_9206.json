    "text": "Resolute: Biden Told to Hide, Nikki Told to Bail, Kari Tells Those Trying to Bribe Her to Jump in a … Well … Lake\nSupreme Court tees up Trump ballot case, Haley pressured to quit, while the question remains, “What ‘very powerful people’ wanted to bribe Kari Lake?” The underbelly is getting exposed, and we are Resolute.\nFirst up, some breaking news: Just saw Nikki Haley on CNN celebrating her victory today in the Super Bowl.\nC’mon. That’s funny.\nMore on her in a bit, but we do have some breaking news.\nSCOTUS Apparently Fast-Tracking Decision on Efforts to Boot Trump from Ballot\nMark February 8th on the calendar. That’s when the Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments in Trump’s appeal to put a decisive end to the efforts to contort the 14th Amendment to keep him off the ballot.\nWhat’s more, the Epoch Times\nreports that a note accompanying the scheduling announcement suggests they will issue a ruling that very day. A sign of how timely and crucial the Court feels this decision is.\nMeanwhile, Maine’s Supreme Court is\ndeclining to rule on the Secretary of State’s appeal of a lower court’s decision to put a hold on her unilateral effort to ban Trump until the U.S. Supreme Court rules. As Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley wrote today:\n“The Maine Supreme Court declined to review the matter. With other states like\nMassachusetts ruling this week against disqualification, Colorado will remain the outlier as the only state supreme court willing to embrace this dangerous and anti-democratic theory.”\nShould Nikki Drop Out of Race?\nOn Tuesday night, Donald Trump earned the\nmost votes ever in the New Hampshire primary. Despite being outspent two-to-one and not camping out there for a year, he scored a double-digit victory over Nikki Haley. And even there, not one in three votes for Haley came from a Republican in the Republican primary. Haley came in third in Iowa. And Trump is set to stomp her on her own South Carolina turf and his primary road gets easier from there.\nHaley is under enormous pressure to get out of the race so the party can concentrate on beating Joe Biden. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is\nwanting Haley out. There are reports breaking this afternoon that the RNC is drafting resolution to declare Donald Trump the presumptive GOP nominee. Even major Haley donor and fan Andy Sabin advised the former UN Ambassador Wednesday to heed the words of Kenny Rogers and “know when to walk away.”\nBut “The Gambler” also sang you need to “know when to run” and that there will be plenty of time for counting ballots when the dealin’s done. So does Nikki need to stop now? Deny voters in states down the line a chance to have a meaningful say? Or does she need to consider the impact continuing will have on the general election?\nAt this point, all she can do is hurt Trump for the general, especially as she has grown increasingly negative and personal, blowing money and sweat equity that should be focused on Biden. (I mean, really, Nikki. Deliberately trying to parallel Trump’s age and acuity to Biden’s? Completely stealing the new Democratic talking point?)\nPlus, she’d be hurting her future prospects if she continues alienating Trump supporters. This is no normal election. Tens of millions of Trump voters feel they were hosed in 2020, then told to shut up about it. A GOP candidate who stands in the way of them getting a shot at payback and shoving 2020 back in the faces of the powers that be might as well take up coding.\nPlease Support The Stream: Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political, Economic, and Moral Issues of Our Day. []()\nThat said, but for Vivek and Tim Scott, none of the people who are calling on Haley to drop out have spent the last year of their lives doggedly trudging through every nook and cranny of Iowa and New Hampshire, hitting coffee shops at 5 a.m., state fairs in the burning sun, late night fundraisers, answering the same questions, giving the same speeches over and over and over and over and over again. None have walked in her heels.\nIf you’re driven by ambition — and that certainly describes Nikki Haley — it ain’t easy to hit the brakes and pull off the road. Or perhaps a better analogy: She’s been running and running and running … like on a treadmill. The workout’s done, but she needs a cool down period before stepping off.\nI suspect if she does step off, say, after South Carolina, and does it with grace, Trump will be the first to hand her a towel.\nBut will he make her VP, as some suggest is Haley’s real angle? That’s for another day.\nIn the meantime, reports are that progressive billionaire Reid Hoffman, who’s been pumping cash into Haley’s campaign while simultaneously funding lawsuits against Trump, has\npulled the plug.\nWho Done It? Update on Effort to Bribe Kari Lake. AZ GOP Chair Resigns\nArizona GOP Chair Jeff Dewit\nresigned Wednesday, a day after bombshell audio exposed him trying to bribe Kari Lake to stay out of the Senate race. Once a big MAGA supporter, Dewit did not apologize for his role in the scheme proposed by “very powerful people back east.” But he did whine about the audio being edited and hinted there are worse tapes to come.\nSo who were those powerful people back east? Stream alumna and pal Rachel Alexander, who has been covering political corruption in Arizona like snow in Alaska, has been digging around. She\nhttps://arizonasuntimes.com/news/nrsc-silent-on-whether-it-was-behind-azgop-chairs-offer-of-money-from-back-east-for-kari-lake-to-stay-out-of-politics/ralexander/2024/01/24/?fbclid=IwAR2w_l6Vrqsk6TEGHzRCgYDVWv4z4feYBHjWGRex4S-hj5-Z48B23wv0X1I in the Arizona Sun-Times her sources are pointing the finger toward the National Republican Senatorial Committee, specifically, Political Director Tim Edson. The NRSC Chair Steve Daines denied … having heard the recording. The NRSC itself has not responded to Rachel’s request for comment.\nBut Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale told Steve Bannon on\nWar Room today that Daines himself had personally intervened to browbeat Rosendale into not running against Democrat Senator Jon Tester.\nBrowbeating ain’t bribes.\nPlease Support The Stream: Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political, Economic, and Moral Issues of Our Day. []()\nMeanwhile, the corruption in Arizona politics is a wonder to behold. Seems there is now a “glitch” in the system that changes Republican voters to Independent in advance of the GOP primary. Astonishing how all these glitches only hurt one party.\nBREAKING: The Arizona Secretary of State has reported a \"glitch\" that is currently flipping Republican voter registrations to Independent ahead of the Republican primary election\nOnce again, Arizona is a national embarrassment for having the most rigged elections in the country…\n[pic.twitter.com/42163ZuGNx]\n— George (@BehizyTweets)\n[January 22, 2024]\nCNN’s Van Jones Has Advice to Biden Campaign: “Keep the Big Guy Hidden”\nCNN’s Van Jones is a progressive, but he sometimes throws the Democrat’s dirty laundry right at the camera. (I’ll never forget how he admitted the Obama Campaign was scared to death of Sarah Palin in 2008 and that they immediately and deliberately set out to destroy her and use their media allies to brand her as “stupid” before the public could learn the truth.)\nVan’s latest? During NH primary coverage Tuesday night, he\nsaid, “Part of what we’re looking at as Trump’s strength, his resilience, is really a reflection of Biden’s fragility. Republicans are not afraid of Joe Biden.” And later in the evening came this kick in the gut.\n“If I were Biden, I would stay hidden. And I’ll tell you why. He doesn’t inspire confidence. And he’s not a great messenger for himself,” Jones\nhttps://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/1750186699248804226/video/1.\n“There’s something wrong with this campaign where we’re somehow expecting Joe Biden — and frankly, he hid during the last campaign — to start come out now and be Flash Gordon and save his own campaign,”\nJones is suggesting the Leader of the Free World has to hide away like a scared rabbit to have any chance of winning and couldn’t inspire a duck to quack. He’s dunking on his own guy.\nAl Perrotta is the Managing Editor of The Stream, co-author, with John Zmirak, of The Politically Incorrect Guide to Immigration and co-author of the counter-terrorism memoir Hostile Intent: Protecting Yourself Against Terrorism.",

(WBOY) — The Salem University Men’s Water Polo team is headed to Stanford University this week to compete in its first-ever NCAA tournament.\nAfter winning the WWPA conference tournament, the team was invited to compete as the only Division II team and will face off against No. 1 UCLA on Friday.\nTwo-time conference player of the year and senior Nikola Krstonosic spoke with 12 News about what winning the tournament meant.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “It was a huge relief. It was really special winning it with these guys. It’s my last year as well, so it is a huge weight off my shoulders, and it was really special winning it with these guys,” Krstonosic said.\nThis program has spent more than a decade working toward a tournament appearance, but many of the people in the area who interact with these athletes are unaware of what that hard work entails.\n“It’s interesting. When I walk around the mall or the town, I usually tell people I play water polo and they have no idea what that is. They ask me where do you put horses in the water and all that stuff. It’s kind of funny, but it is nice to see that from our small town, we can go top eight and play in NCAA’s and maybe grow the sport a little bit more,” Team Captain Ivan Zivojinovic said.\nUSA Diving ‘American Cup’ coming to Morgantown aquatics center\nAdvertisement Advertisement These two players and many more have come to West Virginia from other countries to help grow the sport and be a part of this team. They’re doing this all while getting a chance to pursue the sport they excel in and other opportunities otherwise not afforded to them.\n“I primarily came here because I had an opportunity to do both school and play the sport that I love. It’s just a sport that I love and enjoy playing,” Zivojinovic said.\nZivojinovic’s sentiment was echoed by Krstonosic.\n“It’s amazing. There is no place else that can give you this.
