We are all deeply saddened and shocked by his sudden death.\nBill was born on October 19, 1953, in Evansville to the late Jack and Shirley (Weiberg) Hall. He retired from Millwright Local 1080.

His motto was “never do today what you can put off until tomorrow”.\nSurviving Bill are his wife of 47 years, Shirley; brother, John Hall; his in-laws, many nieces and nephews.\nTo honor Bill’s wishes there will be no public visitation or funeral services held. Please celebrate Bill’s memory privately, in your own way. We know he will be with us all in spirit.

    "title": "New Year's Eve travel disruption: Brits warned there will be train chaos at the weekend as wind and rain hurtles towards the country after Storm Gerrit sparked days of plane, rail and road chaos | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Parts of Britain will endure 75mph wind gusts on New Year's Eve while other areas face heavy rain and snow as 2023 ends with a washout weekend, forecasters say. The Met Office issued a wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. An active cold front will move east across England and Wales tomorrow and into Sunday which will widely bring gusts of 45 to 50mph, but some reaching 60mph and the strongest near coasts in the west and south with 65 to 75mph in places. Meteorologists expect flooding, power cuts and disruption to roads, trains, planes and ferries as well as delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges. Up to 50mm (2in) of rain could fall in North West Wales with 25mm (1in) quite widely elsewhere in the country, while Northern Ireland was told to brace for up to 25mm (1in) in a few hours with warnings that the downpours will fall on saturated ground. Separately, a warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight, with up to 10cm (4in) of the white stuff across higher ground and 3cm (1.2in) even on lower ground as well as 25mm (1in) of rain. The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm - Storm Henk - after Storm Gerrit sparked days of travel chaos following Christmas . Rail operators told revellers to travel to parties today amid concerns over further disruption and staff shortages when severe weather strikes in the next two days - with one operator issuing a 'do not travel' alert for some routes on New Year's Eve. The Met Office has issued a yellow wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. A warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight Storm Gerrit hammering the seafront at Porthcawl on the South Wales coast this morning Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire today after heavy rain from the storm A Knottingley Canoe Club member makes their way down the River Ouse in flooded York today People under umbrellas as they go for a punt on the River Cam in the Cambridge rain today Travel continued to be affected by the storm today, with rail disruption in Wales and Scotland - while LNER cancelled some trains this morning due to staff shortages and other services faced speed restrictions due to a signalling fault north of Newcastle. CrossCountry was operating a reduced service due to a 'shortage of train crew'. Avanti West Coast passengers also faced further cancellations today after all London Euston trains were axed yesterday afternoon amid four separate incidents including a person being hit by a train, a points failure, a tree falling on the line and flooding. Other disruption today included on London Underground 's Central and Circle lines due to train shortages and cancellations; Merseyrail due to a signalling fault; and on East Midlands Railway due to a broken down train at Grimsby. Southeastern was also delayed between Ebbsfleet and St Pancras due to a signalling issue. It comes as: Northern, which runs 2,500 services through 500 stations daily, said customers with tickets for New Year's Eve could use them today or tomorrow to avoid disruption. The UK's second largest train operator issued a 'do not travel' warning for six routes with no service on New Year's Eve - including Morecambe or Heysham to Lancaster; Preston to Colne; Manchester Victoria to Chester; Manchester Piccadilly to Chester via Altrincham; Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge; and Clitheroe to Bolton. Water is pumped out of a house in York this morning after the River Ouse burst its banks Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire today after heavy rain from the storm Knottingley Canoe Club members make their way down the River Ouse in flooded York today Flooding in the city centre of York this morning where the River Ouse has continued to rise Tewkesbury Cricket Club's pavilion is surrounded by floodwater today following heavy rain Dawn breaks over the Oxfordshire countryside in the village of Dunsden this morning A Knottingley Canoe Club member makes their way down the River Ouse in flooded York today Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire today after heavy rain from the storm The midwinter sunrise at Roker in Sunderland this morning as walkers exercise their dogs Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire today after heavy rain from the storm Sunrise at Dunsden in Oxfordshire this morning after Storm Gerrit passed through Britain Other routes across North West England will also have a reduced service on New Year's Eve 'due to train crew unavailability' and are expected to finish early at 4pm. Avanti West Coast : Cancellations today after major disruption yesterday following four separate incidents LNER : Some cancellations across the network due to staff shortages. Other services face speed restrictions due to signalling fault north of Newcastle Merseyrail : Signalling fault between Hamilton Square and James Street CrossCountry : Reduced service due to a 'shortage of train crew' East Midlands Railway : Broken down train causing delays between Cleethorpes and Barton-on-Humber ScotRail : All lines now reopen apart from Dumfries to Kilmarnock, but other lines still face speed restrictions and cancellations with buses in place Transport for Wales : Train services remain impacted until Monday due to severe weather including the Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog and Swansea to Shrewsbury lines Southeastern : Delays between Ebbsfleet International and London St Pancras due to a signalling issue London Underground : Delays on Central and Circle lines due to train shortages and cancellations Fellow operator CrossCountry, which calls at 120 stations over its 1,500-mile network and has faced recent staff shortages, said New Year's Eve trains would be 'extremely busy', also warning of 'last-minute cancellations' and an earlier finish than usual. And Chiltern Railways told of a 'high risk of short notice cancellations and disruption' on all routes this weekend 'due to a shortage of train crew'. Engineering works at Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire on New Year's Eve will compound the misery. ScotRail warned services will 'begin to wind down' from 7pm on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile engineering works continued to affect Greater Anglia trains through Chelmsford and London Victoria station has no Southeastern services until New Year's Day. But Andy Street, Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, criticised 'self-inflicted' cancellations from crew shortages and urged rail firms to provide more clarity. He told the Daily Telegraph : 'Come clean now, that's what people need. I would prefer to know well in advance what is happening so it can be communicated to passenger and they can make their plans. 'The worst possible thing is a last-minute change, particularly late trains being cancelled.' Mr Street said he understood it would be 'tricky' for operators who are replying on voluntary working, but added: 'My insistence is that we know early what is happening.' Northern chief executive Tricia Williams said: 'Unfortunately, customers travelling over the new year period should expect disruption. 'This is due to limited train crew availability in some areas and planned engineering works. We strongly advise customers to 'check before you travel' on these days.' The Environment Agency issued 128 flood alerts (in amber) and 34 warnings (in red) today ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling due to speed restrictions and some replacement buses. It confirmed this morning that the only line that had not yet reopened was Dumfries to Kilmarnock, where Network Rail engineers needed to check the area following further bad weather. Transport for Wales said the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday – including the Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog line. The Swansea to Shrewsbury line was also closed. LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway were among the other operators urging customers to check before they travel today. As for the forecast, meteorologist Alex Burkill said tomorrow is going to turn 'wet and windy' across the UK with a band of 'intense rain' pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly 'severe gales' in exposed spots. He added northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see 'significant snow', with possibly 10cm (4in) or even 20cm (8in) of snow building up on the highest grounds. 'There's a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we've seen over some recent days,' he said. Blustery and showery conditions are set to continue into New Year's Eve, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall across western parts of the UK. The mercury is also expected to drop. text text Mr Burkill said: 'As we look towards the end of the day on New Year's Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight. Here is the forecast from today until New Year's Day from Meteogroup UK: Today : Showers are expected today across the UK, but these are set to remain quite scattered and also light in nature. There is the chance of sleet too in North England and North Wales. There will be patchy clouds and sunny spells across South England. Mostly fresh westerly winds, heavier in the North. Tonight : Tonight will begin dry yet cloudy for most of the UK, except North England, where there may be occasional showers or even sleet. The winds will be light and variable, feeling slightly stronger in parts of Scotland and North England. Rain is expected from the early hours of tomorrow morning. Tomorrow : Unsettled weather is forecast for tomorrow, with heavy rain and widespread cloud across much of the UK. Strong coastal winds can be expected, particularly in North England and South England. Feeling very overcast, with little to no clear breaks. Snow is also expected across most of Scotland. Sunday (New Year's Eve): Light showers throughout the day on Sunday, with plenty of cloud and grey skies. There is a chance of these showers turning wintry in parts of North England and Scotland. Becoming mostly dry by evening. Monday (New Year's Day): Monday will start mostly dry, with some snow in Scotland. Heavy rain over South England by evening. 'So perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies but do watch out for those showers and you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn't been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it's going to feel close to freezing for many places. 'So definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.' New Year's Day should turn drier for many, particularly across more central southern parts of England and across Scotland with the 'central slice' of the UK most likely to have showery rain. 'As we look through the rest of the first week of 2024 and at the moment Tuesday looks like it'd be a largely dry day with some fine weather around before the return to something more unsettled - some heavy rain, some strong winds, and that does bring the potential for something a little bit colder and possibly wintry,' Mr Burkill said. Earlier, the Met Office said an area of low pressure pushing in from the west tomorrow will be the 'most dominant feature' in the forecast leading up to the New Year. While the severe conditions brought by Storm Gerrit have now eased, today will continue to be blustery with showers and central locations were likely to see the brightest conditions. During the early hours of tomorrow morning, a 'potentially deep area of low pressure' will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK. As this system moves eastwards, forecasters said the boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east will lead to a band of transient snow across some of the high ground of northern England and Scotland. The Met Office added that it was 'possible this snow could fall to lower levels for a brief period of time across Scotland'. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale added: 'This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. 'Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.' Chaotic scenes at London Euston once again yesterday as passengers wait for travel updates Rail passengers queue to get inside Glasgow Central yesterday for a London-bound train Passengers wait at a barrier at London Paddington yesterday while all services are suspended Damaged houses in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, yesterday after Wednesday's tornado Residents in the Kinloss Park area of Cupar in Scotland clean up yesterday after flooding Flooded fields on the Somerset Levels yesterday after Storm Gerrit brought severe weather Looking further ahead into 2024, Met Office deputy chief forecaster Nick Silkstone said: 'Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.' It comes as electricity bosses said they 'very confident' that the remaining 750 properties in Scotland without power after Storm Gerrit will be reconnected today. Graeme Keddie, the director of corporate affairs at SSEN, said 'hard work' by its staff has reconnected more than 45,000 properties who had lost power as a result of the latest storm to hit the UK. High winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country, but Mr Keddie said that by this morning there were 750 homes remaining without electricity, describing that as a 'much improved picture'. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, he told how SSEN staff had 'made a tremendous effort in restoring power to customers affected by Storm Gerrit, battling some very tough weather conditions'. He said: 'We have now restored power to over 45,000 homes and there are now 750 homes still to be connected. 'And we're confident through the resource levels we have we can reconnect these customers throughout today.' He thanked those affected for their 'ongoing patience' as the power firm makes its 'final push' to restore electricity. Storm Gerrit resulted in a 'lot of localised faults' to the power network, Mr Geddie said, adding there were a 'lot of points of multiple damage'. This he said was 'down to the ferocity of Storm Gerrit', adding that wind speeds had been up to 10mph higher than had been forecast in some areas. He insisted SSEN had been 'well prepared' for this latest blast of wintry weather, but added that 'we saw some wind speeds five to 10 miles per hour higher than predicted'. Winds at Inverbervie, on the Aberdeenshire cost, reached 86mph during Storm Gerrit, he said - adding this was higher than the 78mph winds that hit the town during Storm Arwen in November 2021. The latest storm was 'more ferocious than forecast', Mr Geddie stated. But he stressed: 'We're very confident of getting all homes reconnected through the course of today. 'We're got enough people and resource and we are absolutely committed in this final push.' It comes after three men died after their 4x4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, yesterday, North Yorkshire Police said. A 'supercell thunderstorm' moved across the North West of England yesterday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged around 100 homes in Stalybridge in Greater Manchester on Wednesday night. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a 'localised tornado' in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, said that some of her neighbours' houses 'are an absolute disaster' with missing roofs and 'squished' cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to the storm yesterday with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.",

    "title": "How to Use Calibre to Manage E-books",
    "text": "If there was ever a perfect app, it’s Calibre! As an e-book manager, it is capable of just about everything that one could want. With it, you can read, shelf, customize, convert, edit, transfer, and even strip digital restrictions from books. With plugins that further build upon its capabilities, Calibre is really a testament to what’s possible with a single software. And yes, it’s free.\nSo if you’ve never used Calibre before and you have books to manage, here is all you need to know to get started with Calibre and set up your very own digital library.\nHow to use Calibre for e-book management (all e-readers)\nGiven the level of customization possible with Calibre, it’d be impractical to go over every little detail. So, for brevity’s sake, apart from covering the basics, we’ll only go over some important functions and a few nifty tricks so you get a hang of Calibre and can explore it further on your own (which we sincerely recommend).\nInstall Calibre and set up your Library\nDownload Calibre, run its setup, and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.\n- When you launch Calibre for the first time, choose a folder for your Calibre library. This is where all your e-books will be kept whenever they are imported into your library.\n- Then select your e-reader device. In most cases (including for Kindles), the Generic options will be enough for most use cases.\nCalibre’s library management operates on a simple search-and-sort mechanism, which is much more efficient than any folder system that one can create on one’s own.\nIf there is more than one user, create another library from the arrow next to Calibre Library in the main toolbar and select Switch/create library.\nAdd books to Calibre library\n- To add an e-book to the Calibre library, simply drag and drop it to the library.\n- Alternatively, use the Add books button at the top left corner, choose your books, and they’ll be added to your library.\nEdit Preferences\nNot everyone’s e-book management is the same. Some users prefer all their books in a particular format; others want nothing more than a new book cover; while others still want a better layout. Letting Calibre know your preferences helps in these regards so the next time you have to add, convert, edit, or view a book, you can just give the order and let Calibre take care of the rest.\n1. Set preferred output format\nAlthough you can convert e-books from one format to another whenever you like using the ‘Convert books’ option (refer to a later section for more on this), you may want to set your preferred output format from the start. Here’s how:\n- Click on Preferences in the main toolbar.\n- Click on Behavior under ‘Interface’.\n- Then select your Preferred output format from the drop-down menu and click Apply.\nIn most cases, you will want to choose the format supported by your e-reader device. For Kindles, it’s AZW3.\n2. Change library layout\nBy default, the layout for your library will list the books in the middle with a search bar at the top and a ‘Book Details’ bar (which shows things like author, publisher, format, etc) on the right. But this layout can look quite dull.\n- To spruce it up, click on Layout in the bottom right corner and choose Cover browser.\n- This will let you scroll through your books like a carousel.\n3. Connect to a book metadata source (Goodreads)\nBy default, Calibre pulls information about books in your library from a variety of sources, such as Amazon, Google, Open Library, etc. But when looking for a book’s information, you don’t need so many sources. Too many cooks spoil the broth, and also eat up a lot of bandwidth and time. Here’s how to select a single preferred book metadata source:\n- Click on Preferences and select Metadata download.\n- Here, disable all but one source, and click Apply.\nIf you want to add Goodreads as a source, you’ll need to install its plugin first. Here’s how:\n- Open Preferences and select Plugins.\n- Click on Get new plugins in the bottom left corner.\n- Search for Goodreads, select it, and click on Install > Yes. Then Restart calibre.\n- Now go to Preferences > Metadata download and make sure Goodreads is selected. Remove all other sources, and click Apply.\nConvert book format\nCalibre offers all the major formats for you to convert your e-books into. Here’s how to convert books with it:\n- Select the books in your library that you want to convert, and click on Convert books in the main toolbar.\n- Select the ‘Output format’ from the top right corner.\nNote: If you’ve already set your output format preference, you won’t have to do this.\n- Click OK and wait for the individual jobs to finish.\n- You will see your chosen format appear in the details section on the right. This means that you now have the book in your original format as well as the new format.\n- (Optional) Save the book by clicking on Save to disk (in its context menu and the main toolbar).\n- The book will be saved in all the formats.\nChange Book Covers and edit Metadata\nA book’s metadata contains important information such as its title, author, publisher, page count, synopsis, blurbs, genre tags, etc. as well as cover images of books. Metadata also helps in e-book library organization on the whole which enables a few other functions on Calibre, such as adding page numbers to books that are missing them.\nTo get a step-by-step guide, refer to our guide on\nHow to Change Book Cover using Calibre. Here’s how you can do so briefly:\n- Select your book and click on Edit metadata in the main toolbar.\n- Click on Download metadata, choose from the available metadata options for the book, and click OK.\n- Then select a cover from the available options and click OK.\n- If you have a cover of your own, in the ‘Edit metadata’ window, click on Browse under ‘Change cover’.\n- Select your book cover file, then click OK.\n- The display covers work perfectly on\nKindle’s lock screenas well.\nTransfer books between Calibre library and Kindle (and other e-readers)\nTransferring books between your Calibre library and Kindle device (or any e-reader device) is as easy as a drag-and-drop. Whenever you plug your device into your PC, you’ll see it reflected in Calibre in the form of a new column, a toolbar option at the top, and a message in the bottom left corner.\n- To transfer a book from your Calibre library to Kindle, drag the book to the Device option in the toolbar.\n- Alternatively, right-click on the book, and select Save to device > Send to main memory.\n- Once the files are successfully sent to your device, you’ll see a tick next to them under the ‘On Device’.\nYou can similarly transfer the files in the other direction, that is, from your device to your Calibre library. Here’s how:\n- Click on the Device option in the main toolbar to view the books that you have on your device.\n- Select the books you want to transfer and drag them to the Library.\n- Alternatively, right-click the book(s), and select Add books to library.\n- Once the book is successfully added to your Calibre library, you’ll see a tick next to it under the ‘In Library’ column.\nNote: You won’t be able to transfer books, such as the ones bought on Amazon, that have digital restrictions. Refer to the following section to know how to get around these.\nSupercharge Calibre with Plugins\nCalibre is quite a capable program on its own. But it is its plugins that truly elevate it to another level. You can get plugins from Preferences > Get new plugins.\nThough there are tons of useful plugins, such as the Goodreads plugin installed earlier, we’d like to direct you to two that we think stand out.\n1. Count Page – To add Page Numbers to Books\nEPUB books sent to Kindle do not get ‘page numbers’, something that does take away from the reading experience. This is where a plugin like Count Page that adds page numbers to Kindle is an indispensable instrument to have. It ultimately makes reading free e-books indistinguishable from reading bought books. Check out our full guide on\nhow to add page numbers on Kindle with this plugin.\n2. De-DRM and KFX – To remove DRM restrictions from books\nTaken together, the KFX and De-DRM plugins strip DRM restrictions from books, so you can have access to them across your devices and libraries. Although Amazon keeps changing its format to lock users from doing so, this is one that still works and even\nremoves DRM restrictions from Kindle Unlimited books.\nApart from the ones mentioned above, you may also want to check out other plugins from the ‘Get Plugin’ option, such as Ebook Translator, Import List, Language Cleaner, or any of the few dozen plugins that serve how you manage e-books.\nFAQ\nLet’s consider a few commonly asked questions about using Calibre.\nCan I manage Kindle collections with Calibre?\nAlthough it is technically possible to manage your Kindle collections with Calibre, you will need to jailbreak your Kindle first, which, given the number of features it’s going to break, is not worth it.\nCan I transfer books from Calibre to Kinde online?\nThere was a time when books from your Calibre library could be sent to your Kindle using a GMX account. However, that method is not as reliable or convenient as the official methods of\nsending books to Kindle.\nGiven the all-round capabilities of Calibre, it’s safe to say that a better book management app is yet to be created. With only a small team of contributors, Calibre has enabled many a library over the years. We hope this guide helped you organize your library with Calibre and use its most important features to improve your ebook management. Until next time! Keep reading.",

    "title": "'Watching too much Fast and Furious': Gorsuch accused of 'yikes' moment with major error",
    "text": "In a 5-4 decision where the\nSupreme Court temporarily hindered a Biden Administration policy to mitigate cross-state smog, Justice Neil Gorsuch's opinion glaringly misnamed the gas.\n\"Justice Gorsuch's opinion refers five times to 'nitrous oxide' (aka laughing gas) rather than the entirely different chemical compound -- smog-causing \"nitrogen oxides\" -- actually at issue in the case,\" reads a\ntweet posted by Sean Donahue.\nIn one paragraph alone, the gas was mentioned twice.\nALSO READ:\nRep. Byron Donalds, his gigantic Jim Crow myth and a forgotten fact about Black voters\nWhen mentioning a Federal Implementation Plan to enforce the reduction of ozone emissions — Gorsuch's opinion reads: \"in particular: nitrous oxide... And it sought to impose nitrous oxide emissions-control measures that 'maximized cost-effectiveness' in achieving 'downwind ozone air quality improvements.'\"\nThe very next paragraph, Gorsuch blundered again and again.\n\"First, the agency identified various emissions-control measures and, using nationwide data, calculated how much each typically costs to reduce a ton of nitrous-oxide emissions,\" according to the opinion. \"Next, the agency sought to predict how much each upwind State’s nitrous-oxide emissions would fall if emissions-producing facilities in the State adopted each measure.\"\nIndeed, the document published on Thursday mentions the wrong gas.\nInhalation of nitrogen oxides in its pure gas form\n\"is rapidly fatal.\"\nBut nitrous oxide, also known as \"laughing gas,\" is the\n\"least potent inhalational anesthetic.\"\nThe decision delivers a win for three Republican-led states: Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia.\nIt also buoys\nsteel and fossil fuel companies who convinced the majority to pause the plan instituted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) calling it unfeasible and potentially illegal as it would force them to upgrade their infrastructure to the tune of billions to cut pollution.\nLast year, the\nEPA had attempted to enforce a rule that would have forced power plants and other creators of ozone in several states with unsatisfactory emission-reduction levels — where pollutants can travel hundreds of miles across the country — to abide by the \"Good Neighbor\" provision of the Clean Air Act.\nGoing along with Gorsuch (typos and all) were Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett’s dissent was supported by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nThe justice's typos were met with lots of lampooning.\nMSNBC anchor Chris Hayes fired off: \"YIKES! Don’t wanna be the clerk that worked on that. Oof.\"\n\"\nClerk watching too much Fast and Furious,\" reads a tweet by EastCoastCheeseHead, referring to the smash hit street racing movie series. @lumberqueue further explains that you can't put a premium on copy editors, writing: \"Is proofreading included in the gratuity?\"\n\"A power plant that gave off nitrous oxide would be awesome, TBF,\"\n@WordOfScott wrote.\nAnd @IvanTheK wonders: \"Does Justice Gorsuch not proofread his work??? How many clerks will lose their jobs?\"",

La prueba de concepto Lenovo Auto Twist AI PC introduce una experiencia de usuario dinámica adaptándose físicamente a los movimientos y utilizando el seguimiento de la cámara basado en IA, lo que garantiza que los usuarios permanezcan atentos durante las interacciones virtuales. La demostración Lenovo Creator Zone aprovecha Stable Diffusion 3.0 para simplificar la creación de contenidos con lenguaje natural y generación de imágenes basadas en bocetos, potenciando la imaginación de los creadores. La demostración ThinkShield AI PC Cybersecurity de Lenovo destaca la detección de amenazas en tiempo real mediante IA, lo que mejora la protección y la seguridad de los datos. Por último, la iniciativa Work for Humankind de Lenovo, demostrada a través de avatares de IA y procesamiento de lenguaje natural, ofrece apoyo en salud mental para la Generación Z, ejemplificando el compromiso de Lenovo de utilizar la IA como una fuerza para el bien. La visión de Lenovo de una IA más inteligente para todos subraya su compromiso de ofrecer soluciones de IA personalizadas, productivas y protegidas en diversos entornos. Ya sea a través de PCs con IA como el ThinkPad X1 2 en 1 Gen 10 Aura Edition, plataformas innovadoras como AI Now y Learning Zone, o nuevas pruebas de concepto como AI Buddy, Lenovo continúa superando los límites. Al combinar la tecnología de IA de vanguardia con una sólida protección de datos, Lenovo busca liderar el futuro de la IA, garantizando que los usuarios puedan trabajar, aprender, crear y colaborar de forma más eficaz en un mundo mejorado por la IA.\nPara obtener más información sobre las soluciones de IA a escala empresarial de Lenovo, consulte los anuncios de Lenovo ISG y SSG.
