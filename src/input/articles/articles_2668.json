    "title": "I'm Worried Marvel Is About to Ruin Juggernaut Over a Terrible Decision",
    "text": "Warning: Contains SPOILERS for The Amazing Spider-Man #68.DEATHS! The Juggernaut has gone through some major changes in Marvel Comics these past few years, evolving from a classic X-Men villain, to a tenuous ally of mutantkind, to a full-blown member of the X-Men itself - and none of this happened overnight. Cain Marko’s journey from villain to hero is one that has taken many years and a number of miniseries/story arcs, which means that Juggernaut’s ultimate redemption was well-earned. But now, it seems as though Marvel is going to undo all of that with one fell-swoop, and I’m worried the publisher is about to make a terrible decision.\nIn an unlettered preview shared by AIPT Comics of The Amazing Spider-Man #68.DEATHS by Christos Gage and Mark Buckingham, the X-Men are fighting each other for reasons that are not made clear in the preview. Except, they’re not exactly fighting each other, but rather, the entire team is ganging-up on one of their own: the Juggernaut.\nThe Juggernaut is on an apparent rampage, fighting his fellow X-Men while they are forced to work together to take him down. The scene is a chillingly familiar one, as the Juggernaut used to fight the X-Men all the time before he found redemption. And now, he’s found himself in that position once more. However, the preview doesn’t end there, as it also shows the spirit of the Juggernaut traveling to the Crimson Cosmos to visit his old master: Cyttorak.\nThe disembodied Juggernaut stands before Cyttorak, who is showing his former slave all the ways he’s changed over the years. From fighting the X-Men during the Juggernaut’s Marvel Comics debut to saving what remained of Krakoa at the end of the X-Men’s Krakoan Era, the Juggernaut is effectively given a slideshow of his entire life. The preview ends with the Juggernaut and Cyttorak standing face-to-face, leaving readers wondering what they’re discussing, and what will come of this unexpected reunion.\nMarvel Might Make the Juggernaut a Slave to Cyttorak Once Again (& That Would Be Bad)\nThe Juggernaut Has Come Too Far to Go Back to the Way Things Were\nWhile it’s impossible to know what they’re talking about in this preview (indeed, it’s unlettered), the clues are there as to what this unexpected meeting between Cyttorak and the Juggernaut is most likely about. Firstly, let’s take into account the fact that the Juggernaut is fighting the X-Men just like he used to do when he was Cyttorak’s avatar, as that alone is a pretty convincing visual indicator that the Juggernaut is going back to his villainous ways. Secondly, there’s the obvious fact that the Juggernaut is meeting with Cyttorak at all, perhaps cementing their mended alliance.\nIf I’m right and the Juggernaut is going to become an avatar of Cyttorak once again, I will be insanely bummed. The Juggernaut severed his ties with Cyttorak in the miniseries Juggernaut Vol. 3, which marked the turning point of his redemption. However, the Juggernaut had decided to be a hero years before that, as he fought alongside the X-Men during World War Hulk, and was even a member of the superhero team, the New Excalibur. In other words, the Juggernaut has come a long way from destroying the X-Mansion and tormenting Marvel’s mutant heroes.\nRelated\nMarvel Tees Up a Big Change to Juggernaut's Powers And Honestly? We Hate It.\nMarvel Comics has just changed Juggernaut's powers in X-Men canon for the worse, a change that effectively nerfs the one-time 'unstoppable' behemoth.\nSo, if he’s going to return to Cyttorak - and, by extension, a life of villainy - after a single issue, I would be very upset. I mean, come on, at least have him descend into villainy if that’s the direction his story is going. But, it seems like he’s simply going to become a villain again just like that, undoing years of storytelling outlining his redemption in one fell-swoop - and I, for one, am not here for it.\nWhy Would the Juggernaut Reunite with Cyttorak in Marvel Comics?\nSpider-Man & Doctor Doom Might Have Sealed the Juggernaut’s Fate\nIt seems like the Juggernaut might be reuniting with Cyttorak, and will effectively become his avatar and a Marvel Comics villain once again. But, why? This preview only shows the Juggernaut acting like a villain while fighting the X-Men before showing him conversing with Cyttorak in the Crimson Cosmos, but it doesn’t explain why he would even consider reuniting with his former demonic master. At least, not in any way that’s obvious, but the comic in which this series of events is taking place does offer a major clue.\nIn The 8 Deaths of Spider-Man, Doctor Doom - who has become the Sorcerer Supreme - has chosen Spider-Man to be a supernatural protector of Earth against the forces of the Scions of Cyttorak. Basically, Cyttorak has children who regularly try to breach through the Crimson Cosmos and take over the world, and Doctor Doom always stops them. But now that Doom is Sorcerer Supreme, he has made Spider-Man responsible for that task. However, Spider-Man hasn’t been up to the challenge, meaning the world could be conquered by Cyttorak and his forces. Unless, perhaps, the Juggernaut makes a deal with Cyttorak.\nRelated\nMarvel's New Juggernaut Unleashes the Full Power of an Iconic X-Men Mutant\nMarvel Comics just introduced a 'new Juggernaut' in X-Men continuity, which only highlights how god-tier powerful another classic mutant has become.\nIt’s possible that the Juggernaut pledges himself to Cyttorak once more if he promises to leave the Earth alone, which would explain why he’s talking to the demon-god in this preview, and why he’s fighting the X-Men like he did back when Juggernaut was a villain. However, regardless of the reason, it would still be really lame if Marvel Comics reset the Juggernaut’s villainous status quo after years of stories detailing his well-earned redemption.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man #68.DEATHS by Marvel Comics is available February 26, 2025.\nSource: AIPT Comics",

    "title": "Aether Fuels and GTI Energy Announce Partnership and Exclusive Licensing Deal to Accelerate Commercialization of Sustainable Fuels for Aviation and Ocean Shipping",
    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nAether Fuels (Aether) and GTI Energy today announced a partnership and global exclusive licensing agreement to commercialize a scalable and economical solution to produce sustainable fuels from low-value and abundant waste streams. The fuels will help aviation and ocean shipping companies (which combined generate more than four percent* of the world’s carbon emissions) achieve their net-zero ambitions. Aether is a venture-backed deep-tech climate company. GTI Energy is a non-profit technology development organization that creates innovative solutions for low carbon, low-cost energy systems.\nThe Research and Development (R&D) partnership began in 2022 between Aether and GTI Energy seeking to build on a gas-to-liquid (“GTL”) technology program initiated by GTI Energy in 2016. The GTL program combines innovations in chemistry (catalysts), equipment (reactors), and process flows to convert gaseous waste carbon streams, such as captured carbon dioxide, industrial waste gases, biogas and converted agricultural residues, into liquid hydrocarbons. The technology development is supported by $6 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as further investments by Aether, which recently\nannounced a $9 million funding round.\nTogether, Aether and GTI Energy have developed a new concept built upon the original GTL program that has the flexibility to convert a wide range of carbon feeds while also producing more product at lower cost than existing approaches. The new solution has been demonstrated in an integrated pilot line at GTI Energy’s Chicago-area campus producing 1.5 gallons of sustainable fuels per day. A 100 gallon per day integrated pilot will start construction at this campus in March.\nThis announcement marks a shift from R&D led by GTI Energy to a new commercialization phase led by Aether’s team of experienced business and technology executives. The licensing agreement gives Aether exclusive global rights to certain key GTI Energy GTL technologies for producing sustainable liquid hydrocarbons. The partnership extends Aether’s R&D contract with GTI Energy and establishes a comprehensive technology transfer program under which Aether will progressively take over the further R&D to scale the new solution. As part of this program, the Aether team will work alongside GTI Energy counterparts, establishing an R&D Center to access GTI Energy’s world-class facilities and team and run the pilot lines.\n“Incubating transformative technologies is just one side of GTI Energy’s immense value; they are equally driven by a mission to commercialize the technologies so that they can impact the world,” said Aether CEO, Conor Madigan. “They are a world-class collaborator with a model that is geared to accelerate technology development and get it to market at scale. As we worked with GTI Energy’s scientists and leveraged the organization’s extensive R&D resources, we simultaneously built our leadership team and started implementing our global business strategy. This made us more agile and reduced our cost structures. Now, with the exclusive license, we can move fast to fulfill the potential of this breakthrough sustainable fuel production solution.”\n“At GTI Energy, we value collaborative partnerships with visionary leaders seeking to create disruptive innovations by scaling integrated technology solutions to address consequential energy challenges,” said Paula Gant, President and CEO, GTI Energy. “We are excited to work with Aether Fuels to leverage our foundational technology to shape low carbon, low-cost fuels solutions for decarbonizing global economies.”\n*\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=snZNpeKNuvy5rN-SXD_N0oyXCh0bK1KXXFYK9HOGyfriutFY-pu1Ngk1-8JUeAPEeNNlrtQjQVEC22KDVh9X5aHxYy0nxL4ERssX4F18KdQqkxML59e7di64shvw2cQ6gz4_3eYzNkNYNelylUUiz3pTWVIT06k8sd6bWJ59J_U=\n*\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=snZNpeKNuvy5rN-SXD_N0oyXCh0bK1KXXFYK9HOGyfriutFY-pu1Ngk1-8JUeAPEOK-HLIh0vvyO86qn8wzxy8GX4uF3-zHPmoIp3WBGT-ILEebEqSAowIxIJk_9dc9lW5oI2TBrT9jXsMnHZTMqZd24_-MN6H6MLtzCqnnLdS9e12ox5vycEmJNs1pcJRPMHc8MVMsj6NQn3gIhVYnl8g==\nAbout Aether’s Solution: Aether’s fuel is made from low-cost and abundant waste carbon streams, such as captured carbon dioxide, industrial waste gases, municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, and waste biomass.

    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL) — After a lull in storm development early Friday, stormy conditions will return to the Florida/Georgia line region before sunrise. Storm action in central Alabama will gradually move southeast through early Friday morning. At the same time, a developing complex of intense thunderstorms will traverse the landscape in central Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and Alabama, arriving in our tri-state area before sunrise. These are projected to have an effect on more of the state line and northern Florida parts of our region. Broad-reaching damaging wind gusts are a primary risk. Wind gusts near and north of I-10 can reach a peak of 75 mph, causing considerable damage potential in affected areas. Some portions of the storm complex will produce hail. An outlying chance for brief tornadoes also exists with this system. A severe thunderstorm watch covers sections of southwest Georgia along the Chattahoochee River, with Early County being in closest proximity to our region. A separate severe thunderstorm or tornado watch may be necessary for local counties during the morning time frame. Showers and storms will straggle around and south of I-10 through midday and the afternoon hours. They won't be as organized or widespread but can still cause downpours, lightning, and localized wind gusts. The cold front contributing to all this activity will slip south of the coast Friday night, allowing for a drier weekend with slightly cooler temperatures.",

    "text": "La Bajada Extraordinaria de la Virgen de la Montaña con motivo del Centenario de la Coronación Canónica está plagada de actividades a las que los fieles están acudiendo. Primero fue la gala flamenca que tuvo lugar en la explanada de la parroquia del Espíritu Santo con la actuación del grupo de folclore de Aldea Moret, del Coro Rociero de Cáceres y del grupo flamenquito Jamakuko, que llegaron desde Cádiz. Y en la noche del jueves le ha llegado el turno a la espectacular concentración de corales que ha abarrotado la parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Fátima, donde la patrona se aloja desde el pasado martes y en el que permanecerá hasta el próximo jueves. A partir de las 21.00 horas, hasta cinco grupos han tenido quince minutos para dedicarle su música a la Virgen de la Montaña. Primero fue el turno de la Coral Santa María. Después, fue la Coral Impulso. Y seguidamente, la Coral Isaac Albéniz, el Orfeón Cacereño y el Coro Francisco de Sande. Lucía la talla de la patrona el manto que portó en el traslado procesional desde el colegio Las Josefinas. Se trata del número 56, confeccionado por las Religiosas Esclavas del Santísimo y de la Inmaculada del Santuario de la Montaña. Es de tisú de plata y la tela fue donada por Doña Manuela de la Montaña Puerto. En la parte de atrás se puede observar una corona bordada y varios pájaros. Sobre la sien, su corona circular de plata dorada, comúnmente denominada de diario. El ornato que acompaña a la patrona en la parroquia es de Atelier Floral Azucena. Ha empleado agapanthus verdes, rosas de pitiminí, hortensia blanca, cilindro, lilium y oriental. La próxima actividad lúdica que se celebrará será en la explanada de San Blas el próximo sábado 28. Contará con cocina en vivo a partir de las 12.00 horas para, posteriormente, degustar especialidades de carne de caza en forma de tapa. También tendrá actos cinegéticos, exhibición de cetrería, talleres de pintura y castillos hinchables.",

    "text": "Umer Jamshaid Published September 13, 2024 | 10:11 PM\nSeattle, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 13th Sep, 2024) Thousands of Boeing factory workers in the United States walked off the job Friday after voting overwhelmingly to reject a contract with the embattled aviation giant, its first strike in 16 years.\nUnion leaders called for the strike to start just after midnight on Friday (0700 GMT), hours after hourly workers in the Seattle region in the Pacific Northwest spurned the tentative contract with a vote of 94.6 percent and to strike with 96 percent.\nA strike will shutter two major plane assembly plants for the 737 MAX and 777 in the Puget Sound region and sidelines some 33,000 workers, further delaying the financially stressed company 's turnaround efforts.\n\"Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,\" said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, after the vote .\n\"We strike at midnight.\"\nShares of Boeing fell Friday as the company 's CFO warned the stoppage threatens to \"jeopardize\" a recovery if it drags out.\nPicketers were out in front of the Renton plant -- where Boeing's flagship 737 Max aircraft is produced -- in the early hours of Friday, holding signs reading \"On strike against Boeing\", according to Bloomberg.\nThursday's vote was a decisive rejection of a deal that line workers said was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives, marking the latest show of defiance by unions following earlier strikes in the auto, entertainment and other industries.\nLed by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had hoped a 25 percent wage hike over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would be enough.\nBut rank-and-file workers reacted with fury to the agreement , which was initially backed by IAM leadership.\n- 'Hollow' commitments -\nWorkers had sought a 40 percent wage hike and critics have said the 25 percent figure is inflated because the new deal also eliminates an annual company bonus.\nOther points of contention include the deal's failure to restore a pension, as well as Boeing's pledge to build its next plane in the Seattle region, which critics said offers no promises beyond the four-year contract.\n\"They're talking about a 25 percent increase and it's not,\" said Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett who voted to strike.\nJanousek, 55, who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, figures his raise is only about nine percent after Boeing dropped the annual bonus.\nBoeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said Friday that the company had put \"our best foot forward\" and felt confident in the deal after it was endorsed by IAM leadership.\nBut Boeing leadership quickly understood that the offer \"didn't meet the mark and was not acceptable\" to the rank-and-file, West said at a financial conference.\n\"We want to get back to the table and we want to reach an agreement that's good for our people, their families, our community,\" West said.\nWest declined to comment on the incremental impact to Boeing profits of enhancing the deal, and said it was too soon to know how the strike would affect the company 's free cash flow for 2024 or 2025.\nSome workers expressed anger about Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, two former CEOs who received multi-million Dollar compensation even as the company faced turmoil upon their departure.\n\"Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well-being,\" said Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic who has been at Boeing for six months.\nPhilbin said he will work side jobs if a strike drags out, but that he and his wife have been holding off on having kids until the situation stabilizes.\n- Big impact from strike? -\nThe IAM's most recent stoppage, in 2008, lasted 57 days.\nAccording to analysts at TD Cowen, a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3-3.5 billion in cash flow and would have a $5.5 billion impact on revenue.\nRichard Aboulafia, managing director of the AeroDynamic Advisory consultancy, said a lengthy strike would damage Boeing's turnaround prospects, but noted that a 2023 strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems lasted less than two weeks.\nBoeing has been under renewed scrutiny since a January incident in which a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing.\nShares of Boeing fell 2.1 percent shortly after midday.",
