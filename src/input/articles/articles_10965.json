    "text": "TEXAS — A big danger we face on the roads everyday is impaired drivers.\nPamela Edward’s 25-year-old son Dillon was drinking and driving and died almost a decade ago. Pamela is sharing his story to help save lives.\n\"Being told that your child is no longer here is the worst feeling that I’ll ever experience in my life or ever have to go through,\" Edwards said.\n\"It changes who you are as a parent, and it never gets any easier.”\nDillon was a husband and father who was about to embark on a family vacation, when his life was cut short after leaving his uncle’s fish fry.\n“I share my story because it needs to be told — I know it was Dillon’s choice to choose to drink and drive, I get that, it’s his responsibility but also we have responsibilities as bystanders and being part of that,\" she said.\n\"His uncle should have played more of a role and prevented him from getting behind that wheel.”\nPamela wants everyone to be safe when getting behind the wheel including our aging population.\nTexas A&M is looking into this.\n“This is the first time in history that seniors are out living their ability to drive safely by an average of seven to ten years, and the first time in history they must plan for not only retiring but retiring from driving,\" said Program Manager of Silver Drivers Safe Texas with Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, Cindy Kovar.\nCindy says drinking and driving killed 229 Texans 55 and older in 2022.\nShe says that age group is enjoying alcohol while being more social especially as they become empty-nesters.\n\"When you’re 55+, most people 55+ are on four or more medications and so we don’t know how those medications are going to affect their driving by themselves, but also how are those medications, the side effects may be even increased because of a little bit of alcohol in their system,\" she said.\nPamela says to remember the people that you love and that love you before driving impaired.\n“I always encourage people to put a photo up in their car — each and every time they get in that car, they see that photo of someone they love so dearly that maybe when they get in that car, that it’s a reminder for them to buckle up, it’s a reminder for them not to speed, it’s a reminder to them to never want to choose to drink and drive,\" she said.\nCindy encourages people to pay attention to how a new medication impacts their body and mind the first few weeks of starting it.\nAlso check with your doctor about how the prescription drugs you’re taking and alcohol combined can impact your body and side effects.",

    "title": "Roskomnadzor Says It's Restricting WhatsApp, Telegram Calls - The Moscow Times",
    "text": "Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor confirmed Wednesday that it is restricting voice and video calls on WhatsApp and Telegram, describing it as an anti-fraud measure to protect citizens, a move both companies later criticized.\n“Calls on these foreign messaging platforms are partially restricted to counter criminal activity,” the state-run news agency quoted Roskomnadzor as saying in a statement. “Nearly all such fraudulent calls have shifted to foreign messengers, which refuse to ensure the safety of Russian users.”\nOn Sunday, Russians across the country began reporting problems making voice and video calls via WhatsApp and Telegram. However, it was not immediately clear how widespread the disruptions were, as The Moscow Times has managed to make calls to people in various regions through the messaging apps without issue.\nRoskomnadzor’s statement confirmed earlier reports that the Russian government was “selectively blocking” calls on the two messaging platforms, which allegedly began at the start of August.\nAccording to the state watchdog, WhatsApp and Telegram have become the primary channels for call-based scams, extortion and recruitment into acts of terrorism and sabotage over the past year. Russia’s Digital Development Ministry said calls on the messaging apps could be restored if they comply with Russian law.\n“No other functions of these apps are being limited,” Roskomnadzor was quoted as saying by TASS.\nWhatsApp is used daily by more than two-thirds of Russians, while Telegram, besides offering instant messaging, is a popular source of news and information. Multiple Russians have told The Moscow Times that the recent restrictions on calls have made it difficult for them to communicate with family and friends.\nOn Wednesday, State Duma lawmaker Anton Nemkin accused both platforms of ignoring Russian laws “for many years,” including failing to remove banned content, and said fraud cases on WhatsApp alone rose 250% in 2024.\n“Partially restricting calls to WhatsApp and Telegram is a necessary measure to protect citizens from one of the most widespread types of crime in the digital environment — telephone and internet fraud,” said Nemkin, who is a member of the lower house of parliament’s Committee on Information Policy, Information Technology and Communications.\nA spokesperson for WhatsApp later suggested in a statement that Russian government restrictions on the platform were politically motivated.\n“WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people,” the spokesperson said.\n“We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia,” they added.\nTelegram, meanwhile, said it “actively combats misuse of its platform, including calls for sabotage or violence, as well as fraud,” and removes “millions of pieces of harmful content every day.”\nThe disruptions come amid reports that the Russian authorities are considering blocking access to WhatsApp entirely, a move that could force Russians to switch to a domestic app called Max.\nWhile still in its testing phase, Max is expected to become Russia’s national messaging platform, similar to China’s WeChat, which has faced accusations of surveilling users and sharing data with the government.\nMax has also been accused of collecting user data, including IP addresses and activity logs, as well as reserving the right to share information with third parties and government agencies.\nMack Tubridy contributed to this report.\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\nDear readers,\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.\nRemind me later.\nRemind me next month\nPrivacy Policy.",

El gobierno de [Bolivia](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/bolivia/a/) anunció este jueves 27 de junio la detención de 17 personas, entre militares activos y en retiro y varios civiles, por su presunta vinculación con el fallido golpe de Estado contra el presidente izquierdista [Luis Arce](https://www.wradio.com.co/2024/06/26/luis-arce-nombra-nuevos-comandantes-del-ejercito-de-bolivia-en-medio-de-golpe-de-estado/). Lea también: “Se ha logrado la aprehensión de un total de 17 personas por haber intentado consumar un [golpe de Estado](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/golpes_estado/a/)”, dijo en rueda de prensa el ministro de Gobierno (Interior), Eduardo del Castillo. Hasta el miércoles 26 de junio habían sido detenidos el general [Juan José Zúñiga](https://www.wradio.com.co/2024/06/27/el-presidente-arce-me-ordeno-sacar-los-blindados-comandante-militar-boliviano-destituido/) y el vicealmirante Juan Arnez, excomandantes del Ejército y la Armada, respectivamente, señalados de liderar la intentona golpista. El gobierno presentó este jueves 27 de junio a los otros 15 capturados con esposas, chalecos antibalas y custodiados por efectivos policiales. “Esto se habría planificado desde el mes de mayo pasado”, señaló del Castillo, y afirmó la policía busca a tres militares en retiro también implicados en la conspiración. Según del Castillo, el plan para derrocar a Arce “estaba liderado” por Zúñiga y Arnez. Ambos oficiales fueron acusados de alzamiento armado y terrorismo, delitos por los que enfrentan una pena de hasta 20 años, según la fiscalía. Entre los civiles detenidos está Aníbal Aguilar, un exviceministro de los años 1980 que coordinaba el programa de erradicación de narcocultivos. Todavía “no están todas las personas que han participado en el intento” de golpe, agregó el ministro de gobierno, quien pidió ayuda a la población para dar con el paradero de los demás sospechosos. “Estamos seguros de que en las próximas horas daremos mayores elementos para transparentar este golpe de Estado fallido”, remarcó.",

Sur le délicat conflit du Sahara occidental, qui oppose, depuis 1975, le Maroc au Front Polisario, mouvement indépendantiste sahraoui soutenu par l’Algérie, Paris, qui a toujours estimé que le plan d’autonomie proposé par Rabat en 2007 était « une base de discussion sérieuse et crédible », le considère désormais comme « la seule base ». En considérant l’autonomie comme unique base de discussion, la France écarte le référendum d’autodétermination voulu par le Front Polisario et retenu par les Nations unies. Elle cède ainsi à la pression marocaine et se réfère à une autonomie dont elle sait pertinemment qu’elle ne peut être mise en place. Si la satisfaction de Rabat est acquise, le cabinet royal s’étant félicité de cette annonce « en soutien à la souveraineté marocaine », la conformité au droit international pose question. En effet, la lettre envoyée par Emmanuel Macron au roi Mohammed VI, rendue publique par l’Elysée le 30 juillet, se réfère à l’autonomie de cette région contestée et précise que « le présent et l’avenir du Sahara occidental s’inscrivent dans le cadre de la souveraineté marocaine ». Ce changement de cap s’expliquerait, selon l’exécutif français, par un souci « d’aller de l’avant », puisqu’il est « temps d’avancer ». Alors comment avance-t-on et quelle autonomie s’agit-il de mettre en place ? L’interrogation est d’autant plus légitime que la France semble être déjà passée à l’étape suivante, considérant le moment venu d’examiner les contrats juteux qui pourraient intéresser les chefs d’entreprise français. Ces derniers ont été informés du nouveau positionnement de la France, avant même l’envoi de cette lettre. Brassage des populations Déjà, en avril, et avant même que ce changement ne fût annoncé par le chef de l’Etat, Bruno Le Maire, le ministre de l’économie, en visite à Rabat, évoquait le financement de plusieurs projets dans cette région, par le biais des banques publiques françaises, et notamment de la ligne électrique à haute tension qui reliera Dakhla, au Sahara occidental, à Casablanca . Deux mois auparavant, le chef de la diplomatie française, Stéphane Séjourné, mentionnait, à Rabat, la nécessité pour la France « d’accompagner [le Maroc], dans la poursuite du développement économique et social de la région », ajoutant, précautionneux, et soucieux du droit, « au bénéfice des populations locales ». « L’Europe doit clarifier ses positions sur la question du Sahara pour dynamiser les relations Nord-Sud » Il est pourtant difficile d’évoquer une autonomie de la région ou encore le bénéfice d’une quelconque population locale. Depuis 1975, le Maroc a annexé ce territoire, administré sa population et en a exploité les ressources. Encouragés par un système de subventions des produits et de salaires majorés mis en place par Hassan II, de nombreux Marocains s’y sont installés, favorisant ainsi le brassage des populations sahraouie et marocaine, de manière à anéantir toute identité sahraouie. Au terme de cinq décennies, il est évidemment difficile de distinguer un Sahraoui d’un habitant venu du Maroc. Considéré comme un succès aux yeux du pouvoir marocain, ce brassage a notamment rendu impossible toute consultation de la population que les textes juridiques désignent comme « locale ».

    "title": "Just a Little Old: Trump has bamboozled white Christian Evangelicals",
    "text": "In 2016, 81% of white Christian Evangelicals voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. In 2020, 80% of white Christian Evangelicals voted for Trump over Joe Biden.\nHow could millions of people who purport to follow the teachings of a man as humble as Jesus Christ support a man as heinous as Donald Trump?\nMaybe writer Stephen King had it right when he wrote, “And behold the Evangelicals of America made a golden Trump and they did bow down and worship him.”\nThe first GOP primary will be held in Iowa on Jan. 15, 2024. Trump is expected to win big, given that Iowa is a hotbed of white Christian evangelism.\nHere are some questions for white Christian evangelicals in Iowa and across the United States who remain loyal to Trump:\nDoes it bother you that Trump bragged that he could grab women by the private parts or that 28 women have accused Trump of sexual assault or that a jury found he more likely than not sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll, to whom Trump had to pay millions of dollars?\nDo you believe that Maine Senator Susan Collins was right when she stated that Trump had learned his lesson after the first impeachment trial?\nDo you think that Jesus Christ would have endorsed Trump’s policy of stiffing contractors who worked for him? Or creating fake universities and foundations?\nWould you like your sons and daughters to act like Trump when they become adults?\nDid you stand up and salute when Trump stated that Gen. Mark Miller, former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of States, should be executed for treason?\nWould you describe the Jan. 6 insurrection as a “peaceful protest” or as a “violent riot?” Trump has said that if elected he will pardon the people who have been convicted for their participation in the insurrection. Moreover, he calls them “hostages.” Do you agree with his stance?\nRuby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the Georgia election workers whose lives were ruined by Rudy Giuliani’s lies about them, were awarded $148 million in a settlement. Was that verdict justified from a Christian point of view? Should other people who lied so that the election results would get overturned be treated the same way?\nYou’ve watched the video recording of Trump trying to get Georgia election officials to find extra votes for him. Was that, as Trump claimed, a “perfect call” or was it an attempt to change the will of Georgia’s voters?\nTrump has suggested that we should abolish the United States Constitution. Should we?\nTrump has suggested that the United States should pull out of NATO. Should we?\nMany observers caution that Trump will try to wreak revenge on his perceived enemies if he is elected to a second term. Do you believe that? If so, does it concern you?\nMillions of Americans send money to Trump to help pay his legal bills. Would the money be better spent giving it to, say, food kitchens or homeless shelters? What would Jesus do?\nIn his Veterans Day message to Americans, Trump described people who oppose him as “vermin.” Hitler and other dictators have used the same terminology. Do you believe that people who oppose Trump are vermin? Are you concerned that Trump would act like a dictator if he is reelected?\nIn his Thanksgiving Day message to Americans, Trump trashed New York Attorney General Letitia James who has brought a $250 million civil lawsuit against Trump and his business and others he believes are looking to “destroy our country.” Was that message consistent with the Thanksgiving spirit?\nTrump has called special counsel Jack Smith “deranged.” Do you believe that Jack Smith is deranged?\nThere is evidence that Trump kept classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and then was less than truthful about it. Do you think he really did that or was this just one more example of the “fake news media” or the “Deep State” trying to bring down Trump?\nLiz Cheney got drummed out of the Republican Party for declaring that Trump was unfit for the presidency because he led an insurrection. Do you believe that anyone who opposes Trump should be banished from the Republican Party?\nChris Kratzer, a pastor of 22 years who left Evangelical Christianity, said, “I am beginning to think that all the hatred Evangelicals have toward Taylor Swift is because everyone can see that she’s more like Jesus Christ than they are.” Do you agree with Chris Kratzer? Moreover, which person acts in a more Christian manner, Taylor Swift or Donald Trump?\nDo you believe that any person in America is above the law?\nThat’s enough questions for now. I don’t expect answers any time soon unless Trump does something really outrageous like, say, shoot someone on Fifth Avenue. Then again, maybe not even then.\nDavid Treadwell, a Brunswick writer, welcomes commentary and suggestions for future “Just a Little Old” columns. dtreadw575@aol.com.\n ",

    "text": "Campeão mundial James Casey completa travessia histórica na Madeira O australiano James Casey, actual campeão mundial de Wing Foil, completou hoje a primeira travessia em SUP & WING foil entre Porto Santo e a Ilha da Madeira (34 milhas náuticas). Neste evento inédito do desporto náutico, organizado pelo Clube Naval do Funchal, em colaboração com a Associação de Promoção da Madeira, o atleta partiu do Porto Santo às 13 horas e chegou à praia dos Reis Magos no Caniço às 18h30. A travessia histórica contou com outros atletas de renome, incluindo Tiago Campos, Frederic Bonnef, Diogo Neves, Luís Freitas, Carlos Gonçalves, João Palhas, Ricardo Rodrigues e Duarte Gomes. Esta modalidade inovadora combina tecnologia de hidrofoil com Stand Up Paddle e Wing Foil, permitindo aos praticantes literalmente \"voar\" sobre a água. Reconhecida como o \"Havaí da Europa\", a Ilha da Madeira oferece condições ideais para a prática de desportos náuticos. Durante a sua estadia, James Casey também vai realizar dois clinics exclusivos: dia 6 de Setembro no Caniço (downwind) e dia 7 no Funchal (flat water). James Casey, um dos maiores nomes do SUP Foil, recentemente destacou-se ao vencer as competições havaianas de Foil em 2023, incluindo a travessia Molokai-Oahu. Ele também detém o Guinness World Record para a maior distância em SUP Foil Downwind: 213 km em cerca de 11 horas.",

    "text": "The crypto world is buzzing with excitement over up-and-coming projects like NuggetRush (NUGX), BlockDAG (BDAG), and Kelexo (KLXO) presales. All three projects are already showing signs of massive growth post-launch and beyond, but which one has the highest potential to create the next wave of crypto millionaires? Boasting a 20,000x ROI potential, BlockDAG not only stands out but also leaves competitors like NuggetRush and Kelexo trailing in its wake. This remarkable potential has caught the eye of investors worldwide, positioning BlockDAG as the top crypto presale to watch.\nKelexo (KLXO) Presale Kelexo (KLXO) is capturing investor interest in the presale market as it launches the first decentralized peer-to-peer crypto lending platform. This platform offers lenders an opportunity to earn passive income via fixed interest rate loans, while giving borrowers access to short-term liquidity without the need for KYC verification. To bolster investor trust, Kelexo has conducted a thorough audit of its lending platform’s smart contracts, ensuring their security and integrity.\nNuggetRush Presale NuggetRush (NUGX) introduces a play-to-earn gaming experience where participants can design their avatars, embark on mining expeditions in collaboration with peers, and collect character NFTs.\nThe NuggetRush NFTs, along with other unique NFT items and mined materials, can be traded or sold within the game’s marketplace. Furthermore, the NuggetRush game supports artisanal miners through charitable contributions from its marketplace revenues, offering an added real-world impact.\nBlockDAG Rises as the Top Crypto Presale in 2024 BlockDAG (BDAG) is swiftly making its mark in the crypto landscape, captivating a global audience with a notable presale achievement of $15.9 million and a $600M fundraising target by the end of 2024. BlockDAG’s presale momentum is truly remarkable, catalyzed by the recent showcase of BlockDAG at the Las Vegas Sphere and the launch of the V2 technical whitepaper, with analysts projecting a total presale sell-out within just three months. Furthermore, they predict a jaw-dropping 20,000x ROI potential for BlockDAG’s investors, praising the project for its groundbreaking technology and strong tokenomics.\nAt the core of BlockDAG’s architecture lies an innovative consensus mechanism that integrates cutting-edge protocols PHANTOM and GHOSTDAG, designed to maximize transactions throughout and maximize network security by encouraging honest node behaviour and deterring malicious activities.\nBeyond its robust network, BlockDAG presents the X-series – a lineup of energy-efficient yet extremely powerful mining rigs that can generate up to $100 per day in passive income, depending on the model. Additionally, BlockDAG introduces a crypto payment card, which will be supported in 38 million outlets worldwide, enabling users to pay with crypto for daily purchases.\nBlockDAG has just moved forward to its 8th (out of 45 in total) presale batch, selling BDAG coins for $0.0045 each. The presale price is slated to increase from one batch to the next, so investors should act quickly while the project is still early in its presale.\nTop Crypto Presale Highlights 2024\nKelexo (KLXO) introduces a pioneering decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform, enabling fixed interest rate loans and granting immediate access to liquidity for borrowers. On the other hand, NuggetRush (NUGX) merges play-to-earn gaming with real-world impact, supporting artisanal miners and offering players tangible financial rewards through NFTs. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is poised to dominate the crypto presale market in 2024, with a staggering $15.9 million raised and analysts forecasting a 20,000X ROI potential for its early investors.\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu",
