    "text": "08/08/2024 - 17:49\nA líder opositora María Corina Machado alertou, nesta quinta-feira (8), para uma “onda migratória” inédita de venezuelanos se o presidente esquerdista, Nicolás Maduro, insistir em se manter no poder após a sua controversa reeleição, enquanto os Estados Unidos anunciaram um aumento da pressão internacional caso líderes da oposição sejam presos.\nMaría Corina, que denuncia uma fraude e reivindica a vitória do seu candidato, Edmundo González Urrutia, nas eleições de 28 de julho, enviou, por meio da imprensa, uma mensagem ao México sobre a possibilidade de uma “onda migratória” inédita se Maduro permanecer no poder “à força”.\n“Digo uma coisa [ao México], se Maduro decidir se manter pela força, na marra [no poder], poderemos ver uma onda de migração como nunca vimos: 3, 4, 5 milhões de venezuelanos em muito pouco tempo”, disse María Corina, em videoconferência com a imprensa mexicana.\nSegundo números ONU, 7,7 milhões de venezuelanos emigraram nos últimos anos devido à crise, somando-se às centenas de milhares de migrantes de outras nações, principalmente centro-americanos, que atravessam o México rumo aos Estados Unidos.\nO anúncio da vitória de Maduro pelo Conselho Nacional Eleitoral (CNE), alinhado ao governo, desencadeou protestos que resultaram em pelo menos 24 mortos, segundo organizações de direitos humanos, e mais de 2.200 detidos, de acordo com o próprio Maduro.\nCom os Estados Unidos à frente, vários governos pediram ao CNE a publicação das atas com os detalhes dos resultados eleitorais, enquanto se somam às denúncias da oposição venezuelana sobre uma escalada repressiva contra os adversários de Maduro.\nWashington, que lidera o endurecimento das sanções contra a Venezuela desde 2019, elevou o tom nesta quinta-feira, advertindo que a prisão dos líderes poderia “mobilizar ainda mais a comunidade internacional”, incluindo os países que têm melhor relação com a Venezuela.\n“Se Maduro decidir fazer isso, ele ativará a comunidade internacional de formas que não poderia imaginar, e acho que seus esforços para dividir e fracionar a comunidade internacional terão fracassado rotundamente”, disse o embaixador dos Estados Unidos junto à OEA, Francisco Moraante.\nEnquanto isso, o governo de Maduro denunciou uma invasão no sistema de transmissão de dados do CNE e acusou Washington de estimular um golpe de Estado.\nEstados Unidos, União Europeia e países da América Latina como Argentina e Peru consideram que González Urrutia venceu a eleição, e inclusive muitos governos aliados de Maduro, como o Brasil, pediram que ele entregasse as atas de votação.\n“E o que têm essas tão alardeadas atas que causaram uma espécie de histeria internacional vinda de Washington e de alguns governos satélites?”, ironizou nesta quinta-feira a vice-presidente Delcy Rodríguez durante um encontro com membros do corpo diplomático em Caracas.\n“Há uma histeria internacional sobre as atas, poderiam até fazer uma série na Netflix, ‘As atas na Venezuela, histeria coletiva’, me desculpe, embaixador da França, mas ofuscaram até as Olimpíadas, as atas ofuscaram as Olimpíadas na França, porque há uma histeria com as atas”, concluiu Delcy.\nEm meio às denúncias de fraude eleitoral, Maduro pediu as prisões de González Urrutia e de María Corina, além de ter pedido à Sala Eleitoral do Tribunal Supremo de Justiça (TSJ), acusado de servir ao chavismo, para que certificasse sua vitória.\nGonzález Urrutia, um diplomata discreto lançado como candidato devido à inelegibilidade de María Corina por uma decisão do TSJ, alinhado ao chavismo, desobedeceu a duas convocações da corte máxima, que previamente indicou que não comparecer “teria consequências” legais.\nTanto González Urrutia quanto María Corina limitaram suas aparições públicas, e María Corina, inclusive, afirmou temer pela própria vida.\nA oposição afirma ter 80% das atas digitalizadas em um site que comprova a vitória de González Urrutia, mas o governo de Maduro diz se tratar de um material repleto de inconsistências.\nmbj-pgf/dga/jb/mvv-lb",

    "text": "Summary\n- Some of the best hiking trails in Washington require permits.\n- The Snow Lake Trail is a stunning permit hike, but it's challenging with steep switchbacks, offering breathtaking views of Snow Lake nestled in a dramatic cirque as a reward.\n- The Skyline Loop trail is a popular Washington permit hike, providing stunning views of Mount Rainier and Emmons Glacier.\nWashington State seems to be overflowing with hidden lakes, jaw-dropping waterfalls, towering mountains, emerald forests, and wildflower meadows that look straight out of a dream. But here's the thing: some of these dreamy spots are like the VIP sections of Washington's hiking trails, and you have to obtain permits to get in. Still, that just makes the reward even sweeter.\nIn this list, you'll discover some of the\nbest hikes in Washington that require permits. Make sure to apply for each hike's respective permit in advance to avoid disappointment! [Related ](/waterfall-hikes-in-washington-to-take-in-summer/) [ 8 Waterfall Hikes To Take This Summer In Washington ](/waterfall-hikes-in-washington-to-take-in-summer/)\nCombining beauty and geological significance, these magnificent waterfalls in Washington, reached via scenic hikes, are worth the chase this summer.\n7 Skyline Loop Trail\nBreathtaking panoramic views of the Cascade Mountains and great for wildflower spotting in late spring/summer\nWithout a doubt, the\nSkyline Loop Trail is one of Washington State's best hiking trails, and for all the right reasons. The trailhead is located at Paradise, near the Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center and Paradise Inn. From either park entrance (Nisqually or Stevens Canyon), it's about a 40-minute drive to Paradise.\nThe first leg of the trail is a steady climb through subalpine meadows. At 1.7 miles, 2.7 kilometers into the hike, you’ll get to Panorama Point. This is a popular spot to take a break and enjoy stunning views of Mount Rainier, Emmons Glacier (the largest glacier in the continental US by volume), and the surrounding valleys. You'll also find interpretive signs here explaining the glacial features.\nAfter Panorama Point, the trail climbs more steeply through meadows and rockfall areas into the Wilcox basin. You might spot some marmots and pikas sunning themselves on the rocks here.\nThe final stretch brings you back to the Paradise area, where you can relax and relish your accomplishment. Treat yourself to a well-deserved meal or snack at Paradise Inn, or explore the visitor center for further insights into Mount Rainier's wonders.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.8 (Hard)\n6 Snow Lake Trail\nA scenic hike with a beautiful alpine lake as the reward; plus, a chance to see mountain goats\nThe\nSnow Lake Trail is 6.7 miles (10.8 kilometers) out and back. Prepare for a significant climb of approximately 3,400 feet (1,036 meters). Budget an average of 3–4 hours for the round trip, but adjust based on your hiking pace and breaks.\nOne of the most\nscenic Washington hiking routes, the starting point of this trail is located at the north end of the main parking lot at Alpental Ski Area. The trail begins with a gradual climb through a scenic forest. You'll cross over a cascading waterfall, which is a refreshing sight and sound on a warm day.\nAt this point, you'll encounter a junction with the Source Lake Overlook Trail. If you're up for some additional mileage and stunning views of Snow Lake from a different perspective, this detour adds about a mile (1.6 kilometers) to your hike.\nAfter the junction, the trail kicks into high gear with a series of steep switchbacks. This is the most challenging part of the hike, so take your time and pace yourself. As you emerge from the trees, you'll be rewarded with your first breathtaking view of Snow Lake nestled amid a dramatic cirque. Take a moment to soak in the scenery and capture some photos.\nBe prepared for sudden weather changes, especially near the lake. Pack layers and rain gear. The trail can be crowded, especially on weekends. Consider going early or on weekdays for a quieter experience.\nPermit Required\n| |\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation\n[Related ](/most-hike-friendly-towns-in-washington/) [ 8 Most Hike-Friendly Towns In Washington ](/most-hike-friendly-towns-in-washington/)\nThese are some of the best hiking towns in Washington, each providing easy access to some of the state's most scenic and diverse trails!\n5 Wallace Falls Via Woody Trail\nEasy access, perfect for families with children, and a stunning waterfall as the highlight\nThe\nWallace Falls Via Woody Trail in Washington is a fantastic hike for families and adventurers alike. The trail gains about 1,300 feet (396 meters) in elevation. Most of the climbing is concentrated at the middle and upper falls.\nThe trailhead is conveniently located near the parking lot at Wallace Falls State Park. There are restrooms and an information kiosk available here. The initial part of the Woody Trail is a pleasant walk through a second-growth forest alongside the Wallace River. Thereafter, you'll come across a bridge crossing the Wallace River. This marks the spot where the relatively flat Railroad Grade Trail branches off.\nThe first cascade you'll encounter is the Lower Wallace Falls. This 20-foot waterfall tumbles over moss-covered rocks into a clear pool. It's a great spot to take a break and enjoy the cool spray.\nThe trail continues along the river, with a more noticeable incline as you gain elevation. The path is well-maintained with switchbacks, making the climb manageable.\nAt about 2.3 miles or 3.7 kilometers into the trip, you'll bump into the magnificent 60-foot Middle Wallace Falls. This is the tallest and most powerful of the three (but it is not as tall as the other\nincredible high-elevation peaks that you can hike in Washington!).\nThere's a viewing platform where you can marvel at the power and beauty of the cascading water. Many hikers choose to turn around here and enjoy the view before heading back. If you're up for the challenge, the trail continues towards Upper Wallace Falls. This section is the steepest part of the hike with switchbacks through a denser forest. Take your time and enjoy the fresh mountain air before heading back along the same path downhill.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Moderate)\nLocation\n4 Lake 22 Trail\nHike to a tranquil and secluded alpine lake surrounded by towering evergreens\nThe\nLake 22 Trail in Washington is a popular route for hikers seeking a beautiful alpine lake surrounded by old-growth forests. The trailhead is situated on the Mountain Loop Highway, east of Granite Falls. Look for the well-marked sign for the Lake Twenty-Two Trail (#702). There's a parking lot nearby, but it can fill up on weekends, so arrive early.\nThe initial part of the trail winds through a lush rainforest with towering old-growth trees. Listen for the sounds of Twenty-Two Creek flowing alongside the path. You'll encounter a bridge crossing over Twenty-Two Creek. Here, you can take a moment to admire the waterfalls before moving along.\nThe trail continues its upward journey, with switchbacks helping manage the incline. Be prepared for some sections with loose rock or roots, so watch your footing. After a series of switchbacks, you'll be rewarded with your first glimpse of the beautiful Lake 22 nestled in a cirque.\nThe vibrant turquoise water surrounded by lush forest creates a breathtaking vista that makes up for all the loose rocks that may have hit your leg on your way up. You can relax on the shore of the lake, take in the stunning scenery, and enjoy a well-deserved lunch break. There's a one-mile loop trail around the lake if you want to explore further.\nThis is a challenging hike with a steep ascent. Be sure to be in good physical condition before attempting it. Bring plenty of water and snacks, as there are no services on the trail.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation\n3 Mount Si Trail\nA challenging hike with rewarding summit views, great for experienced hikers seeking a workout\nThe Mount Si Trail is generally considered one of Washington’s hardest hikes, so it is not exactly ideal for young children. The consistent incline, switchbacks, and final scramble make this a challenging hike for experienced hikers.\nThe trail begins with a moderate climb through a lush evergreen forest. Things begin to change at about 1.5-4 miles, 2.4-6.4 kilometers into the hike. The trail picks up the pace here with a series of switchbacks that steadily climb the mountainside. This section can be tiring, so take your time and enjoy the fresh mountain air. As you gain elevation, the forest thins, revealing glimpses of the valley below.\nAt 4 miles, you'll get to the Old Trail Junction. This steeper and shorter trail leads to the summit, but it's not recommended for everyone due to its loose terrain. The main trail continues to the right. If you continue on the right path for about half a mile, you'll be rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding peaks, including Mount Rainier on a clear day.\nThe final push to the summit involves navigating granite slabs and a short scramble. This section requires good balance and sturdy footwear. If you're not comfortable scrambling, it's best to turn around here and enjoy the views from the top of the main trail.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation\n2 Bridal Veil Falls Trail\nHike to one of the tallest waterfalls in Washington, easily accessible with a moderate hike\nThe Bridal Veil’s Falls trail begins by following an old road bed through a beautiful forest of towering Douglas firs, maples, and moss-covered trees. The trail continues along the old road bed, but you'll encounter a few streams that you'll need to cross using provided rocks or small bridges.\nThe incline starts to pick up a bit here, but it's still manageable. At the 2-mile mark, you'll reach a junction with a short side trail leading to Lake Serene. This pretty alpine lake adds about 0.25 miles (0.4 kilometers) to your hike if you choose to go there and back.\nContinuing on the main trail towards Bridal Veil Falls, you'll start encountering steeper sections with switchbacks and stairs. The last stretch of the trail is the steepest. Take your time and use the provided handrails and stairs for balance.\nAs you near the top, you'll start hearing the roar of the falls and might even catch glimpses of the cascading water through the trees. Congratulations! You've reached the base of the magnificent 1328-foot (405-meter) tall Bridal Veil Falls.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Moderate)\nLocation\n| |[Related ](/scenic-washington-hikes-less-than-five-miles/) [ 7 Scenic Washington Hikes Less Than Five Miles ](/scenic-washington-hikes-less-than-five-miles/)\nThese Washington hikes 5 miles or less may be short but offer a lot; scenic meadows, forests, wildflowers, waterfalls, and stunning viewpoints await!\n1 Colchuck Lake Trail\nA challenging adventure for experienced backpackers with a stunning turquoise lake nestled in a cirque\nStarting a hike on the\nColchuck Lake Trail is easy. The initial section begins with a pleasant walk through a cool, evergreen forest alongside Mountaineer Creek. After this initial section, the trail gets steeper as you switch your way back up the hillside. There's a bridge crossing over Mountaineer Creek, offering a nice spot to take a break and enjoy the sound of rushing water.\nThe trail enters a section with more open terrain and loose rocks. Watch your footing carefully, especially in this area. At around 4 miles, you'll reach a junction with a side trail leading to Aasgard Pass, which is a popular route for backpackers venturing deeper into the Enchantments wilderness.\nAs you climb higher, the trees become more sparse, revealing breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. In late summer, this section is often bursting with colorful wildflowers. The same thing happens on other\nbeautiful Washington hidden gem summer trails. If you’re lucky, you might see some marmots or mountain goats here.\nYour final destination is only a few meters from this section. The crystal-clear water reflects the surrounding peaks, creating a picture-perfect scene. Enjoy a well-deserved rest on the shore, have a picnic lunch, and take in the beauty of this alpine paradise. There are campsites around the lake, but overnight stays require a permit during peak season (May 15–October 31).\nGoing back downhill can be tough on the knees, so take it slow and use hiking poles for extra support if you have them.\nPermit Required\n| |\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation",

This request comes in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision permitting the removal of razor wire installed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, pending ongoing legal proceedings. “To our knowledge, Texas has only permitted access to Shelby Park by allowing public entry for a memorial, the media, and the use of the golf course adjacent to Shelby Park, all while continuing to restrict U.S. Border Patrol’s access to the park. Please clarify the scope of access Texas permits to the public,” says the letter from DHS general counsel Jonathan Meyer – [CMuirhead] In a letter addressed to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on January 23, Jonathan Meyer, the chief lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), urged the state to provide federal agents access to Shelby Park, a region recently taken over by Texas authorities. Meyer asserted that the DHS aims to investigate allegations made by the state, which they believe to be either inaccurate or necessitating clarification. ‘Texas is right. Biden’s failure to secure the border leaves states no choice but to take matters into their own hands. As President, I will end this humanitarian crisis once and for all. I will secure the border and destroy the business model of the drug cartels. A country without borders is not a country at all, said Robert F Kennedy Jr. So as Biden and his Merry Marxists complain about Texas trying to protect the borders of this nation, here’s Benny Johnson in a fast reminder clip.

The earlier ruling would have prohibited Border Patrol agents from removing razor barriers along the Rio Grande, including the Shelby Park area, designed to deter illegal immigration. This legal victory strengthens the Biden administration’s position in its ongoing dispute with Texas over efforts to curb illegal border crossings.

He emphasized that the DHS acquired permanent real estate interests in the region in 2008 to support border barrier construction and maintenance. We just got a copy of the letter the Department of Homeland Security sent Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton demanding access to Shelby Park by Friday. The letter says despite Shelby Park being public, the state has not allowed U.S. Border Patrol in. [#KSATnews] [pic.twitter.com/jEnVpKfBNh] — KSAT Daniela Ibarra (@KSATDaniela) [January 25, 2024] Texas assumed control of Shelby Park earlier this month, responding to a surge in illegal border crossings. However, the Biden administration criticized Texas in the wake of a tragic incident where a mother and two children drowned in the Rio Grande. The administration claimed that Texas officials physically barred the victims from entering the area, an accusation vehemently denied by state authorities. It was later proven with video that the Biden Administration lied about it all, as usual. In a statement, the Texas Military Department contested the Biden administration’s narrative, revealing that Border Patrol agents sought access to the area after the drownings, while Mexican authorities were already recovering the bodies. Texas Attorney General Paxton labeled the administration’s claims as “vile” and “completely inaccurate.” But what do we expect from Biden and his handlers, who have lied about everything from day one. Since he was installed into the White House, like a cheap toilet by the Deep State, using scam votes at 3am in multiple states, he has moved to disable the nation and topple the U.S. dollar, as well as support and create wars all over the planet. He has gone so far as to support Hamas terrorists with over 100 million US dollars after they slaughtered Jews a few months ago, starting the current Gaza War. He has even recently given over 600 million dollars to the Palestinian Authority, so they can pay their Martyr families. Such families have the photos of their killer children lining the streets in Judea, or West Bank. These animals receive a pension from the PA for killing Jews, and their families receive the payouts forever, now paid by the U.S. Taxpayer. Then of course, as a result of these animals attacking Israel, we then gave Israel billions more of our tax dollars, so they can shoot down the rockets and fight off Hamas, that we are also supporting. This is the insane world of Democrats. The current variety is the most deceptive and war like Marxist Party in power in all American history. The DHS has sent Texas a letter demanding that Border Patrol be given access to Shelby Park, an area at the center of a tense border dispute between Biden and the Lone Star State.

The state has even initiated the arrest of illegal immigrants in the area for criminal trespassing. Sure, the Supreme Court says Biden can cut the razor wire and help the invasion and destruction of the U.S. But that doesn’t mean Texas can’t keep putting it up as a response. Nothing in the world. We all await the photoshoots and media covering Biden ordering the cutting of the razor wire. It will make headlines all the way to the election. On social media, Lt. Chris Olivarez of the Texas Department of Public Safety announced arrests of single adult men and women at Shelby Park. The Texas Military Department affirmed its commitment to holding the line in Shelby Park to prevent unlawful entry into the state, emphasizing their dedication to securing the border, upholding the rule of law, and protecting the state’s sovereignty.

Not only just cost them money but bring in crime…People are moving to…Republican states…In order to stop that… [pic.twitter.com/UHoUsCpb41] — Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) [January 25, 2024] As the conflict between Texas and the Biden administration intensifies, the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border remains complex, with legal, political, and humanitarian dimensions influencing the ongoing discourse. The Biden Administration has shown that it merely wants more funds so they can increase the numbers of illegals coming in. This is all to bankrupt the United States within the next couple of years, or surely to hamper a Trump Administration that will definitely be taking power next January, assuming we have a free and fair election, unlike 2020. Biden and his handlers shaping policy are at odds with the vast number of Americans who are now seeing through it all. No amount of media control can change the growing consensus that our POTUS and his ilk are doing all they can to hurt this nation in nearly every way.

Lo ha reso noto il servizio meteo della Ue, Copernicus, confermando con dati definitivi quanto aveva anticipato alla fine dell’anno scorso con dati provvisori. Il 2024 è stato anche il primo anno in cui la temperatura media ha sforato il limite di 1,5 gradi di riscaldamento dai livelli pre-industriali (1850-1900) previsto dall’Accordo di Parigi, arrivando a +1,60 gradi.\n Secondo Copernicus, nel 2024 la temperatura media globale sulla superficie terrestre è stata di 15,10 gradi Celsius, 0,12 gradi sopra la media del 2023, in precedenza l’anno più caldo della storia. L’anno scorso la temperatura media globale è stata di 0,72 gradi sopra la media del trentennio di riferimento 1991-2020 e di 1,60 gradi sopra i livelli pre-industriali 1850-1900. Copernicus rivela che ciascuno dei 10 anni passati, dal 2015 al 2024, è stato uno dei 10 anni più caldi mai registrati. L’anno scorso la temperatura media mensile ha superato 1,5 gradi dai livelli pre-industriali per 11 mesi. Dal luglio del 2023, tutti i mesi hanno superato la soglia di 1,5 gradi, salvo luglio 2024. Il 22 luglio del 2024 è stato il giorno più caldo mai registrato, con una temperatura media di 17,16 gradi Celsius.\nRiproduzione riservata © Copyright ANSA",

A severe thunderstorm warning still persists. Meanwhile, nearby areas - New Braunfels and Austin - are also on alert. Thunderstorm in San Marcos on Thursday Photo : Twitter Videos coming from San Marcos show severe damage due to a violent thunderstorm as a tornado warning in the Texas city expired. A severe thunderstorm warning still persists. Meanwhile, nearby areas - New Braunfels and Austin - are also on alert. The National Weather Service (NWS) asked residents in the affected areas to take shelter as soon as possible. Several social media users posted videos and pictures of baseball-size hail raining down from the sky. \"STRONG ROTATION ON RADAR HEADING DIRECTLY INTO SAN MARCOS. Get into an interior room of your home immediately. This tornado will be followed by destructive baseball size hail,\" a weather forecaster warning ahead of the storm. Locals said multiple trees were uprooted and homes were damaged in San Marcos. The tornado is moving southeast of the city, towards Georgetown. \"Praying for my parents, family and friends. Major storm with a history of producing a tornado, very large hail and strong winds just hit them. They are hunkered down but just lost electricity. 🙏🏽,\" one person said on X, platform formerly known as Twitter. The National Weather Service issued tornado watches in multiple North and West Texas counties. The following were affected (as of the 9 PM update): Bosque, Coleman, Coryell, Ellis, Hill, Kimble, Mcculloch, Mills, Runnels, Taylor, Brown, Comanche, Dallas, Erath, Hood, Lampasas, McLennan, Palo Pinto, San Saba, Stephens, Callahan, Concho, Eastland, Hamilton, Johnson, Mason, Menard, Parker, Shackelford and Tarrant.

    "text": "A los clavos de olor se les reconoce por ser grandes aliados en los hogares. Una de sus características es el potencial que tienen para dar sabor y sazón a diferentes preparaciones gastronómicas. Se dice que esta especia posee propiedades medicinales que ayudan a hacerles frente a algunas afecciones médicas; también es una importante fuente de nutrientes, como vitaminas A, E y betacaroteno.Información del portal El Poder del Consumidor indica que este alimento se ha utilizado durante miles de años como remedio para diversos problemas de salud. Por ejemplo, ayudaría a aliviar síntomas de gripa y resfriado, como el dolor de cabeza, los escalofríos y la fiebre, ya que es un antiséptico, antipirético y analgésico natural.Pero más allá de eso, de acuerdo con la técnica china del feng shui , estos ingredientes son capaces de atraer dinero de una manera fácil. Al respecto, el portal Panorama web indica que para cumplir este objetivo se deben seguir ciertos lineamientos. Por ejemplo, es importante ubicarlos en sitios específicos con el fin de que abran caminos hacia la abundancia en poco tiempo . La recomendación, de acuerdo con esta técnica milenaria, es colocarlo en una planta, pero no en cualquier especie. Tiene que ser una en específico porque su relación con el feng shui incrementa las energías económicas a favor. Se trata de la lengua de suegra.Según Panorama, para echar a andar este truco solo se requiere de tres muestras de este ingrediente de cocina. Son en específico esa cantidad porque cada uno tendrá la misión de atraer prosperidad a la vida y la de la familia. De acuerdo con esta filosofía, estos son los significados de los tres clavos de olor que se pondrán en la mencionada planta:Para colocarlos solo se tienen que ubicar en la tierra de la matera en la que está la planta y ponerle energía positiva para atraer la abundancia. Clavo de olor y limón El portal Cocina Fácil indica que otra forma en el que clavo de olor ayuda a traer riqueza es mezclándolo con limón.Para ello se requiere de lo siguiente: Para preparar este truco casero se colocan tres pizcas de sal en el envase de vidrio. Después se pone en cada limón un clavo de olor y se ubica dentro del envase en forma de triángulo. Encima de cada triángulo se pone una moneda.Posteriormente, se coloca este preparado cerca de donde se guarda dinero, por ejemplo, cajones, cajas fuertes, armarios. De esta forma se atraerá la abundancia.Otro remedio fácil que también involucra los clavos de olor es el siguiente: con un billete de cualquier denominación, se coloca dentro de un tarro o frasco de azúcar aromatizado con gotas de vainilla y tres clavos de olor. Se deja reposar el preparado por una semana, luego de la cual se debe retirar el dinero del tarro y comprar un kilo de azúcar. En la cultura popular se dice que pocos días después se supone que el dinero llegará.",
