    "title": "SGPC slams Centre over ‘Veer Bal Divas’ school plays on martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons",
    "text": "The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has hit out against the central government for allowing the portrayal of the characters of Sahibzadas Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh in various school plays during the ‘Veer Bal Divas’ events.\nTerming such plays against Sikh principles and traditions, the SGPC has ‘sought an explanation from the CBSE, along with the Ministries of Education, Culture, and Minority Affairs of India.’\nVideos on social media show school children playing the roles of Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, the younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Guru of Sikhs on the occasion of ‘Veer Bal Divas’ on December 26. The SGPC considers such plays to be against Sikh principles.\nIn a statement, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said that any anti-Sikh move cannot be accepted, as it goes against Sikh principles, customs, traditions, and values.\nDhami mentioned receiving complaints from the Sikh Sangat about children playing the characters of Sahibzades, stating, “We have asked the different ministries of the central government and CBSE to explain their stand on these plays performed in schools.”\nFor not embracing Islam, Guru Gobind Singh’s mother, Mata Gujari Ji, and his two younger sons, Zorawar Singh (9) and Fateh Singh (7), were executed at Sirhind in December 1704.\nIn January 2022, the Centre announced that December 26 would be observed as ‘Veer Bal Diwas’ to mark the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh’s younger sons.\nDhami said that, as per the direction from Sri Akal Takht Sahib, the SGPC had already requested the central government to change the name ‘Veer Bal Diwas,’ as it does not represent Sikh sentiments of martyrdom associated with the day. However, the government did not take it seriously, he alleged.\n“The concern of the SGPC and the Sikh Sangat regarding Veer Bal Diwas has come true when children are playing the roles of Sahibzadas. The responsibility for this anti-Sikh activity lies directly with the central government and the respective state governments. Such actions can never be accepted by the Sikh world, and action will also be taken against the educational institutions that portray the character of Sahibzadas in student plays,” said Dhami.\nAccording to the Public Information Bureau (PIB), various interactive and participative programmes were conducted leading up to the day in all schools of States/UTs and autonomous bodies under the Department of School Education and Literacy to commemorate Veer Bal Diwas.\nOver 52 lakh students, teachers and stakeholders participated in the events which included special assemblies, essay, poetry, and painting competitions, screening of short films, and stories recounting the valour of the Sahibzadas across the country.\nA digital exhibition detailing the life story and sacrifice of the Sahibzades was also displayed.",

    "text": "Free Beacon Names Scott Jennings 2024 Person of the Year\n“Jennings might be the first normal dude who has ever been given a regular platform on a mainstream news channel.”\nThe Washington Free Beacon chose CNN’s Scott Jennings as the 2024 Person of the Year, for obvious reasons.\nI mean, Jennings is single-handedly saving CNN:\nSeriously, though. The fanatical resistance Jennings encountered over the course of the election was on par with Imperial Japan. Night after night, he faced down psychotic freaks who insisted to the bitter end that Joe Biden was fit to run for reelection, that Kamala Harris was a competent candidate, that slapping a camo hat on a prancing Tim Walz would help Democrats win back normal male voters. Few individuals did more to expose the alarming degree to which the liberal journalists who claim to speak for all Americans have become hopelessly detached from their fellow citizens.\nJennings might be the first normal dude who has ever been given a regular platform on a mainstream news channel. That would explain why his commentary, which accurately reflects what most Americans believe, is constantly melting the brains of his highly credentialed fellow panelists. Videos of Jennings schooling libs on CNN often\n[get more]views than CNN itself, which makes sense because the only people watching CNN these days are in the Joe Biden demographic when it comes to age and cognitive function, dozing off in the nursing home common room, or waiting for the hospice nurse to come change their adult diaper.\nWho could forget Jennings dismantling the left’s “Trump is Hitler” narrative?\nCNN's\n[@ScottJenningsKY]absolutely shredded this Trump/Hitler news cycle by the left and John Kelly.Scott's correct to point out the decades now of Republicans from George W. Bush to McCain to Paul Ryan and now Trump all being called Nazis by their opponents.\n[pic.twitter.com/yyE4MqRMIm]— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck)\n[October 23, 2024]\nRemember when Jennings made the CNN panel gasp when he told them that most men of all races think Democrats care more about men who pretend to be females? He wasn’t wrong, considering the left hates men and blames them for everything.\nMe, on Harris’s problems w/ working class men of all races on\n[@cnn]: “Alot of men think Democrats care more about dudes who want to become women than they do about dudes just wanna be dudes. No amount of hunting cosplay or cringy videos is gonna change it. The bed is made.”[pic.twitter.com/X5BW2xJzOj]— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY)\n[October 13, 2024]\nYes, the antisemitism we’ve seen since October 7, 2023, has come from the left.\nThe progressive left is the source of the ugly anti-semitism in America since Oct 7 & everyone knows it. I was happy to point it out this morning on\n[@cnn].[pic.twitter.com/bExVI70oPe]— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY)\n[September 20, 2024]\nJennings pointed out the Democrats staged a coup against President Joe Biden.\nFolks, we need to take up for President Biden. The “party of democracy” is organizing an undemocratic coup against our President & we need to speak up for the very fabric of our Constitution. My latest tonight on\n[@cnn]w/[@abbydphillip]& friends.[pic.twitter.com/WdgITPmay1]— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY)\n[July 20, 2024]\nThe Free Beacon concluded:\nFor holding his own in hostile territory on a nightly basis, and for owning the libs on national television with a ruthlessness that few possess, Scott Jennings is a Washington Free Beacon Man of the Year. We never thought we’d say this, but we’re starting to hope CNN survives (at least a few more months) so we can keep watching.\nDONATE\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.",

    "text": "FLINT — Hurley Medical Center staff call the addition of two revolutionary robotic-assisted technologies—the ION Endoluminal System and the da Vinci 5 Surgical System—real game changers in the fight against lung cancer.\nThis new technology has positioned Hurley as the only hospital in the region to offer both of these state-of-the-art platforms, according to Hurley officials.\nThis significant advancement brings world-class, minimally invasive surgical care closer to home, eliminating the need for patients to travel to Detroit or Ann Arbor for leading-edge procedures.\nION Endoluminal System: “A Breakthrough in Lung Cancer Diagnostics.”\nThe ION Endoluminal System represents the next frontier in robotic-assisted lung cancer diagnostics. Specifically designed to navigate the complexities of the lung, the ION system enables physicians to obtain tissue samples from deep within the lung with remarkable accuracy.\n• Ultra-thin, maneuverable catheter allows access to hard-to-reach areas of the lung.\n• Unmatched stability and precision significantly outperform traditional manual biopsy techniques.\n• Dual-lung visualization in a single procedure improves efficiency.\n• Early detection of even the smallest tumors enhances outcomes and reduces risk.\n• Lower complication rates, including reduced risk of lung collapse.\n“This groundbreaking tool provides physicians with a safer, more efficient way to diagnose lung cancer earlier, ultimately improving survival rates and patient care,” said Rick Barker, director of respiratory & neurology services. da Vinci 5: Elevating Minimally Invasive Surgery Hurley also welcomes the da Vinci 5 Surgical System—its second da Vinci robot—to its surgical suite. This fifth-generation platform enhances the capabilities of surgeons through high-definition, 3D magnified visualization and unmatched precision.\n• Enhanced precision and dexterity with robotic arms that mimic, and even surpass, the flexibility of the human hand.\n• Minimally invasive techniques result in smaller incisions, less scarring, and quicker recovery.\n• Reduced post-operative pain and shorter hospital stays for many patients.\n• Improved surgical outcomes due to advanced control and visualization.\nThe da Vinci 5 serves as an advanced tool in the hands of skilled surgeons, enabling more complex procedures with better outcomes for patients.\n“At Hurley Medical Center, we are committed to delivering the highest standard of care,” said John Stewart, service line administrator at Hurley. “Bringing both the ION and da Vinci 5 systems to our community exemplifies our mission to provide cutting-edge technology and expertise right here in Flint.”\nWith these innovative platforms now available, Hurley continues to lead the way in minimally invasive, robotic-assisted care—enhancing outcomes, reducing recovery times, and expanding access to the most advanced surgical technologies in the region.\nAs part of our Employee Appreciation Week, Hurley is proud to host the Intuitive Thoracic Oncology Mobile Unit, showcasing the two revolutionary technologies now available at our hospital: the ION and the da Vinci 5 robotic systems.",

En otras asambleas se había hablado del no cierre de ciclo lectivo, como una medida más de impacto administrativo en las escuelas, y también advertencias de no inicio de clases en el ciclo lectivo 2025, una acción lejana si lo que se pretende es instar al Gobierno a rever su postura y cerrar el año con una mejora salarial para el sector.\nFinalmente se inclinaron en la votación final, pasadas las 20:30, por el paro en consonancia con la jornada nacional y sumar el pedido de renuncia de la ministra de Educación, Patricia Campos, por considerar que “manifestó un desprecio por el ámbito paritario desde el primer momento”, recordando que no asistió a los primeros encuentros.\nLa acusaron por los descuentos aplicados, los recortes en las licencias médicas y la quita de licencias gremiales.\nEl Congreso resolvió además exigir una convocatoria a paritaria “que contenga una propuesta de recomposición salarial para el último trimestre” y que esa oferta sea para todos los cargos, con la premisa que no haya más trabajadores de la educación por debajo de la línea de pobreza.\nTambién se advirtió que no cumplirse con esas exigencias no comenzarán las clases el próximo año.\nLos reproches de Unter y las diferencias con el Gobierno\n“Pretendemos salarios dignos, una patronal que reconozca nuestro trabajo y le dé a la educación la importancia que merece como pilar fundamental para la sociedad”, reclamaron desde Unter en el arranque del congreso que reunió a dirigentes de las 18 seccionales de la provincia.\nUnter y el Gobierno discrepan en el análisis del impacto de los aumentos otorgados en el 2024. Mientras que la administración de Weretilneck mantiene el discurso de haber superado los índices de inflación, incluso con las proyecciones de noviembre, el sindicato acusa de no contabilizar noviembre y diciembre de 2023, que registraron una inflación de 12,8% y 25,5% respectivamente.\nUnter llegó al último mes del año con una relación distante con el Gobierno que se tensó aún más en septiembre cuando el sindicato que conduce Silvana Inostroza decidió un paro de 24 horas en rechazo a la nueva modalidad de control de ausentismo para los estatales. Esa acción encendió el malestar en el Gobierno y desde entonces se aplicaron descuentos por los días de paro, que impactaron en los salarios de los docentes y también en el nivel de adhesión a las medidas de fuerza. Así se evidenció en la estrategia de paros zonales que se cumplieron en octubre.",

    "text": "- France - AS Monaco Le transfert de Neil El-Aynaoui vers Monaco capote pour une histoire de genou El Aynanon. L’AS Monaco pensait avoir conclu [son deuxième gros transfert du mercato estival](https://www.sofoot.com/breves/las-monaco-officialise-larrivee-du-jeune-attaquant-george-ilenikhena), avec la signature de Neil El-Aynaoui en provenance du RC Lens. Malheureusement, le club du Rocher s’est pris une clim de la part de son propre médecin. L’Équipe rapporte en effet que le milieu de terrain de 23 ans a échoué lors de sa visite médicale. Le Franco-Marocain avait subi une entorse au genou gauche le 29 avril dernier lors d’un match face à Marseille. L’articulation n’aurait pas suffisamment cicatrisé, et une opération serait nécessaire. Celle-ci pourrait éloigner El-Aynaoui des terrains durant pas moins de sept mois. Dans ces conditions, l’ASM aurait dès lors décidé d’annuler le transfert. Une transaction à 15 millions d’euros, avec 2 millions en bonus, était pourtant sur le point d’être actée. Ces derniers jours, le joueur de 23 ans n’avait pas pris part au début de la préparation des Artésiens, bien que Will Still avait pourtant assuré qu’il n’y avait « rien d’alarmant ». Déjà qu’il a tardé à avoir son diplôme d’entraîneur, ce n’est pas tout de suite que Still aura celui de médecin.
