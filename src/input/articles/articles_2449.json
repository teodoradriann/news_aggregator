    "title": "No, heat lightning isn’t real",
    "text": "Credit: IthiriaSoler - stock.adobe.com In many places, “heat lightning” is common during the hot, humid months of July and August. Heat lightning, according to some, is a flash of cloud lightning that isn’t accompanied by thunder and is caused by the heat. A social media post with over 12,000 likes claims that heat lightning doesn’t actually exist. THE QUESTION Is heat lightning real? THE SOURCES THE ANSWER No, heat lightning is not real. WHAT WE FOUND There is no such thing as soundless lightning caused by hot, humid temperatures. The soundless flash of light people often call “heat lightning” is actually caused by regular lightning produced by thunderstorms. The lightning is just too far away to be seen or heard, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Extension says. The faint flash isn’t the lightning itself; it’s light from the strike being reflected off of higher-level clouds, the National Weather Service (NWS) says. The bolt or flash of lightning might be obscured by mountains, hills or trees, the NWS says. And if the lightning is far enough away, then the curvature of the Earth might hide the lightning beyond the horizon. Thunder can only be heard for about 10 miles from a flash of lightning, according to the NWS. So if the lightning is far enough away to be hidden by the horizon, you’re not going to hear any thunder from it. Sometimes it’s possible to still not hear any thunder even if the lightning is closer. That’s because bodies of air with different densities can bend sound waves so that they might not ever reach the ears of an observer, according to the Farmers’ Almanac. The Midwestern Regional Climate Center says heat lightning may be visible from flashes 100 miles or more in the distance. That kind of distance can be made possible by hazy skies because the flash of light from lightning will reflect off of the layer of haze, the Farmers’ Almanac says.

    "title": "Senate bill may repeal nursing home staffing mandate, but steep Medicaid cuts likely would follow",
    "text": "Skilled nursing providers remained stoic this week about a potential Medicaid payment hit even as House leaders prepare to vote on a bill calling for at least $1.5 trillion in federal spending cuts.\nThe Senate and House are drafting separate budget resolutions, with Republicans tasking the House committee that oversees Medicaid with trimming $880 billion in costs over a decade as part of the larger spending reduction effort. Given strong “hands-off” messaging on Medicare and Social Security coming from the White House, experts have said major Medicaid cuts would undoubtedly have to be on the table.\nBut that debate could be on hold if Senate leaders get their way and delay the debate on Medicaid. The popular safety-net insurance plan covers more than 72 million Americans and the majority of nursing home care in the US.\nWhile House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) said Wednesday that the House will vote on a one-bill solution next week, Senate Republicans are pushing a two-bill proposal that would deal with deeper cuts later.\nThe split approach, according to Roll Call, would first help pay for enhanced immigration enforcement by axing the nursing home staffing mandate — which was projected to cost the federal government $22 billion over a decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office report last summer.\nThe CBO estimate doesn’t break down those costs, and it’s unclear what they are related to, given that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rule puts the bulk of costs on providers and actually called for Medicare savings of $318 million annually starting in the rule’s third year.\nSkilled nursing experts contacted by McKnight’s Long-Term Care News Thursday could not explain the discrepancy.\nIn any case, nixing the staffing mandate would be viewed as a win for the nursing home sector.\nBut even if it’s pushed off for now, budget-related pain almost certainly would come later in the form of Medicaid cuts that could cap federal spending for the program or create block grants. Or force states to roll back expansion or make tough choices about how well they reimburse nursing homes and other providers.\nImplications for Medicaid pay\nLong-term care organizations, caregivers and patients joined together on a Protect Medicaid press call Thursday to discuss the possible implications of Medicaid cuts and their potential residual effects across healthcare sectors.\nMany lawmakers believe Medicaid cuts will not affect older adults because other, more expensive alternatives would be available to them, said Amber Christ, managing director of health advocacy at Justice and aging, during the Zoom call. But that view couldn’t be farther from the truth, she charged.\n“[Lawmakers] think that because seniors have Medicare, everything is covered. But Medicare has huge gaps in coverage — the biggest gap being coverage is for long-term care,” Christ said. “Medicaid is the only program paying for the assistance seniors need with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing and getting out of bed.\n“It is Medicaid, not Medicare, that is the primary payer of long term care in this country,” she reminded.\nMore than six in 10 nursing home residents rely on Medicaid to pay for their care, she explained.\nIn Pennsylvania, roughly 200 nursing home workers held a rally Thursday in support of sustaining federal Medicaid funding. The state’s bed count continues to decline with many operators citing low reimbursement rates as a major concern.\n“We should be expanding Medicaid, not cutting it,” said Matt Yarnell, president of SEIU HCPA. “That’s why we are anxious to work with responsible owners, to defend what we all need. We must come together — owners and operators, elected leaders, workers, community members — to elevate care.”\nAdministration intent questioned\nPresident Trump has made the budget task even tougher for Congress by recently vowing not to cut Medicaid. On Tuesday, he told Fox News that Medicaid is “going to be strengthened — but won’t be touched [in the budget-process]. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.”\n“Now, if there are illegal migrants in the system, we’re going to get them out of the system, and all of that fraud,” Trump added, according to a White House transcript of the show.\nThat has led others to warn that lawmakers or the Department of Government Efficiency might try to disguise Medicaid cuts as reform or use other disingenuous tactics.\n“In the coming fight about Medicaid, large swaths of Medicaid spending will be relabeled ‘fraud,’ just as all kinds of federal health programs have been labeled ‘DEI’ to cut them,” KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said on X, formerly Twitter, Thursday.\nProviders remain skeptical\nThe Senate is working to vote on its first budget bill this week. The House is in recess, but leaders have pledged a vote when it returns to business next week.\nStill, several high-profile skilled nursing executives have argued on earnings calls that massive Medicaid cuts are unlikely, especially given Republicans’ slim majority.\nOn Thursday, Sabra REIT’s Rick Matros said the two chambers being so far apart on how to address Medicaid — if at all right now — is likely a good sign. He predicted a cut somewhere under $1 trillion would not impact nursing homes, but rather home- and community-based services, expanded coverage for people under 65 and even the Children’s Health Insurance Program before seniors.\n“I’m more optimistic than pessimistic about Medicaid, or certainly the overall impact of [cuts],” Matros said. “We’re living in a time that’s completely unpredictable. So I tend to fall back on the bipartisan support, the lobbying efforts, the fact that this stuff is statutory and you’ve got states involved as well as both chambers of Congress. It’s just not going to be that simple to hurt people who are most dependent on government aid.”\nBut others have said that getting the $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in cuts needed to offset the cost of extending expiring tax cuts and paying for the administration’s new priorities will be nearly impossible without impacting any of the entitlement programs.\n“I appreciate the president’s comments … reaffirming his commitment to not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, but I still need some clarity from my colleagues in the House on how we’re gonna get to the numbers mandated in the resolution without cutting Medicaid in a way that it impacts beneficiaries or my hospitals,” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) told The Hill this week.",

    "text": "The 2023 football season has officially come to an end for the Aggie Football team and new head coach Mike Elko has a lot to look forward to in the future.\nI don’t think anyone knew what to expect when the Aggies took the field at NRG Stadium on Wednesday night. Then, when third-string QB Jaylon Henderson was knocked out of the game on the very first play from scrimmage, it appeared that skipping the game altogether might have been the wiser choice.\nHowever, true freshman Marcel Reed , 180 pounds soaking wet, showed that Aggie spirit and fought all game long, giving A&M a fighting chance to the very end. Two seniors, Max Wright and Sam Mathews, played huge roles in keeping the game in reach, capping off their final game in the Maroon & White. Wright finished the game with four receptions for 62 yards and Mathews finished with a career night that he will never forget.\nHis stat line consisted of a team-leading 14 tackles, 1.5 TFLs, and an interception. Max and Sam both talked about their time at A&M and what this season meant to them.\n“Texas A&M, to me, is the perfect representation of what it means to be people of honor and people of character. It’s the best university in the world, and there is no other university like it. I will be an Aggie for the rest of my life.” – Max Wright\n“This season has been one I’ll never forget. Those last weeks might have been my favorite on this team with how everybody bought in and committed to each other. It was special to be a part of.”\nBelow, you can hear everything Max Wright and Sam Mathews had to say following the game.\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on Twitter, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "text": "Columbia Gas offers safety tips for Severe Weather Awareness Week\nHARRISONBURG, Va. (WHSV) - Like every other appliance in a home, natural gas appliances and lines are at risk during severe weather, but protection steps can be taken to secure them during harsh weather.\nMarch 10-14 is Severe Weather Awareness Week in Virginia. Jennifer Montague, president and chief operating officer of Columbia Gas of Virginia, said unpredictable weather can’t be controlled, but damages in the home can be prepared for and potentially avoided if the right steps are taken.\n“In Virginia, some of the severe weather threats we face in the spring include thunderstorms, flooding and tornadoes, so get ready now,” Montague said.\nSome tips Columbia Gas encourages customers to follow are:\n- Have an emergency plan and practice it with your family.\n- Label gas valves, water valves and electricity main switches. Teach responsible family members how and when to turn them off.\n- Store any flammable liquids, such as gasoline, paint and cleaning products, away from any natural gas appliance with a pilot light.\n- If your appliances have been impacted by severe weather, do not attempt to place natural gas appliances back in service yourself. A qualified professional should check, clean, repair and test all gas appliances and pipes.\n- If you smell the sulfur-like “rotten egg” odor of natural gas or think there may be a gas leak, stop what you are doing, leave the area immediately and then call 911 and the Columbia Gas emergency line at 1-800-544-5606.\nMontague emphasized the importance of maintaining gas meters around the home. She said people sometimes don’t understand the importance of keeping them visible and clear, especially when emergency work needs to be done.\n“Don’t let debris build up around the natural gas meter. Sometimes in people’s basements, they have stuff all piled around it, so we want to make sure people don’t do that,” Montague said. “If it’s outside, some people might build nice gardens around it, we really want to make sure nobody does that.”\nCopyright 2025 WHSV.

The assembly that is attempted to be loaded has quite a long name (59 characters without the .dll postfix). As a test, we changed the name of the assembly to a shorter name. Unfortunately the issue remained. Adding a probing path in the exe.config also did not fix the issue.\nFurthermore, there seems to be code of an older version of the Microsoft Assembly Resolver available at Github:\nhttps://github.com/fixdpt/shared-source-cli-2.0. I suspect there is something wrong in the ConstructCodeBaseList in adlmgr.cpp. But I can't figure out what triggers the issue.\n*** Assembly Binder Log Entry (2020/01/30 @ 13:48) *** The operation failed.
