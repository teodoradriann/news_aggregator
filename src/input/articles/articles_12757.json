In Cape Breton, the freezing rain is expected to begin Friday afternoon before changing to snow.\nMore on Canada\n“The risk of freezing rain is higher over high terrain,” the statement noted.\nEnvironment Canada’s warnings and statements come on the heels of significant wind storms in the region.\nPowerful winds battered New Brunswick and Nova Scotia early last week, and officials said more than 100,000 people woke up in New Brunswick last Tuesday morning without power.\nThe power outages persisted into the holidays, with more than 500 New Brunswick Power customers waking up Christmas morning in the dark.",
