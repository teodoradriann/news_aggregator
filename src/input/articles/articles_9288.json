    "title": "💳 Vacation Debt Trap: Why Financing Your Trip is a Costly Mistake",
    "text": "Can you afford your next vacation?\nBe honest.\nIf you said no, you’re in good company. Last year’s big travel trend was the “justified vacation” or “justi-vacation,” which is when someone takes a vacation despite being unable to afford it. In a survey conducted by insurance and travel assistance company Allianz Partners, 47 per cent of Americans said they couldn’t afford a vacation, but 49 per cent said they were likely to travel anyway.\nAnother survey by Bankrate found more than 1 in 3 travellers were willing to go into debt to pay for it.\n“Taking on debt to pay for a vacation is not a smart decision,” says Steven Kibbel, a certified financial planner. “Credit card interest rates are high, typically 20 per cent or higher.”\nThat means your dream vacation could cost much more than you bargained for.\nLook, people have been going into debt to finance their vacations since there have been vacations. But now they’ve gone too far. Americans owe more than $1 trillion in credit card deb t , partly driven by a voracious appetite for miles. And many see putting their vacation on plastic as a “win-win” — they get the instant gratification of a trip now, plus “free” miles they can use for a future trip.\nGoing into debt for a vacation is not the best idea. It’ll hurt your finances, stress you out and probably leave you needing another vacation. There are much better ways of dealing with a trip you can’t afford.\n“Never, ever, ever go into debt to travel,” says Suzanne McConaghy, an expert on travel finances. “Make a plan, set a goal, save your money — and then go.”\nOK, but why?\nWhy is going into debt to travel crazy? The allure of a picture-perfect vacation, often fueled by social media, can quickly lead you astray. Admit it, those images of Instagrammers enjoying a five-star resort, paid for entirely with “free” miles, are irresistible.\nIt’s also a lie.\nThere’s no such thing as free . True, travel hackers are racking up points and miles with each debt-funded stay. But they’re also playing a dangerous game. If you don’t pay off your balance in full every month, the interest charges will quickly negate the value of any rewards you earn. It’s a fool’s errand.\n“Taking on any form of debt can significantly increase your stress levels,” says Jeremy Clubb, founder of Rainforest Cruises , a tour operator specialising in riverboat and small ship cruise packages in the Amazon and Southeast Asia. “That often outweighs the relaxation and mental wellness travel is meant to provide.”\nI interviewed dozens of travellers for this story, some of whom insisted that taking on debt to travel was sometimes justified. They said for special occasions or once-in-a-lifetime events like a honeymoon, it is indeed appropriate to go into the red. Some even claimed the points made it all worthwhile.\nTo which I say: nonsense! The more exceptional the occasion, the more financially conservative you ought to be. Who wants to spend the first year of your marriage drowning in debt?\nHow do you afford a vacation, then? I will give it to you straight: Living within your means is the best way to ensure a stress-free vacation.\n“Try being more creative about how you travel,” says Jeremy Murchland, president of Seven Corners Travel Insurance . “For starters, think about why you want to travel. Unless your heart is set on a certain destination, you might find some alternative ways to achieve your vacation goals without setting yourself back.”\nIn other words, plan and explore alternative options that don’t require going into debt.\nI know the travel advisors of the world will hate me for saying this, but maybe consider a staycation, visit local attractions, or take a road trip to a nearby destination.\nBut what if you want to go somewhere pricey?\nMitch Krayton, a professional travel advisor from Denver, says you should save for a big trip.\n“Sweep $100 to $200 a week automatically from your checking into a special savings account,” he advises. “When you are ready to travel, you book with cash in hand. You not only will feel better that you can afford the trip, but you won’t have the letdown a month after you come home to a large bill.”\nDon’t spend more than you have. It’s that simple.\nΜaybe you need a vacation budget. There are two types of travellers: Those who spend as little as possible and those who don’t know the meaning of “budget.”\nIf you’re in the latter group, listen up: One of the best ways to avoid overspending is to create a budget. Apps like TravelSpend or Trabee allow you to visualize your expenses, track them, and plan your trip to avoid spending too much.\nIf you don’t want to use your smartphone on vacation, you can always invite a friend in the former group — those who never spend. (That would be my brother.) They can spend the entire trip telling you, “No.”\nAnd if you are in the former group, this story is not for you. You will never overspend on your vacation. I should have interviewed you for this article.\nOther ways to avoid vacation debt OK, how else can you steer clear of vacation debt? Here are a few ideas:\nTake a staycation. Spend a week exploring your town. You might be surprised at what you discover. “Staycations can sound horrible,” says Sam Hohman, CEO of Credit Advisors Foundation . “But if as much planning goes into them as a destination vacation, they can be really memorable and personally restorative.”\nTravel during the off-season. “Anywhere you desire to see is going to be just as great during its off-season,” says Christopher Falvey, co-founder of Unique NOLA Tours . “But it will be less crowded and less expensive.” So you get the same experience for less — just because you waited a few weeks.\nAbbreviate your vacation. “If all you just need is a break – and who doesn’t? – figure out how you can enjoy time off without it costing you much money,” says Erica Sandberg, a consumer finance expert at CardRates.com. For example, a weekend getaway instead of a two-week adventure may be enough to recharge your batteries. And it’ll save you time, too.\nSo, the next time you’re tempted to book that dream vacation on credit, remember this: A trip paid for with debt is a trip you can’t afford. Instead, focus on saving and planning. You’ll enjoy your vacation more knowing you’re not coming home to a mountain of bills.\nWritten by: Christopher Elliott\nBIO:\nChristopher Elliott is an author, consumer advocate, and journalist.

What's important to understand is that the human body is a vessel for the Soul/Spirit. The death of the earthly body is something that happens to everyone. While many people think death is some horrible thing, it's really not. After death, the Soul/Spirit are released, so they can join God in Paradise.\nLike I said, Seth isn't wrong, but he's not telling you the whole story. After Yeshua's crucifixion, his Spirit returned to the Pleroma (carrying no memory of it's time on earth, simply a spark of pure divine energy), while the Soul (which belonged to Yeshua) became trapped in Sheol. Yeshua's Soul laments it's fate in Psalm 22. It was basically trapped in purgatory until Christ the Messiah arrived on earth (a couple months ago), and set things straight.\nYeshua's Soul is now united with its Spirit in Paradise, just as all Souls/Spirits will eventually be after they die.\nThis is why, in Revelation 1:5, Jesus says that he is \"the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth\". Most people think Jesus is firstborn from the dead because of the resurrection, but this can't be the case, because as soon as Jesus dies in the Gospel of Matthew, the Saints are resurrected in the body, and go into the Holy City. Jesus isn't resurrected until three days later (if you're counting time linearly).\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 86441194\nCanada\n10/21/2023 09:31 AM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Christ as Yeshua never died on the cross!!!\nThis is the Sethian account of the crucifixion, which isn't completely accurate, but also isn't completely false.

And in my mind, that demonstrates that the soul and spirit left the physical body already and was simply observing the body reacting neurologically.\nKorgh\nUser ID: 47568645\nUnited States\n10/21/2023 09:38 AM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Christ as Yeshua never died on the cross!!!\nThere were two Christ's roaming the earth around 2000 years ago and the nag hammadi texts say this regarding Christ and the crucifixion;\nThe one who came to give gnosis said to me;\n\"He whom you saw on the tree, glad and laughing, this is the living Jesus.

    "text": "Uccise la moglie e la figlia nel sonno, preda di una rabbia legata a presunti problemi economici mai esistiti, e ferì gravemente il figlio maggiore, tanto da costringerlo a lungo in sedia a rotelle. Alessandro Maja, geometra della provincia di Varese, trascorrerà il resto della sua vita in carcere. Colpite nel sonno, ferì anche il figlio maggiore a Samarate. E la Corte di Cassazione ha confermato la sua condanna all'ergastolo per aver spento la vita della moglie Stefania Pivetta e della figlia minore Giulia, di soli 16 anni, e per aver ferito alla testa Nicolò, 22 anni, nella loro villetta di Samarate (Varese), nel maggio del 2022. A presentare il ricorso in Cassazione erano stati i legali dello stesso Maja, per provare a ottenere un diverso esito processuale rispetto alla condanna a vita, comminata all'omicida sia in primo grado, dalla Corte d'Assise del tribunale di Busto Arsizio, sia in secondo grado dalla Corte d'Assise d'Appello di Milano. \"Li ho uccisi tutti\" La Suprema Corte ha rigettato il ricorso presentato dai difensori dell'uomo reo confesso, confermando in via definitiva il fine pena mai. Confermate anche tutte le pene accessorie e i risarcimenti nei confronti delle vittime della tragedia a cominciare da Nicolò che, a causa delle gravissime ferite inflittegli dal padre, sta affrontando un lungo percorso fatto di interventi e riabilitazione per riuscire a riprendersi. Quella drammatica notte Maja aspettò che i suoi cari fossero addormentati per agire. Solo Nicolò reagì, probabilmente svegliato dal rumore o dall'unico grido lanciato da sua sorella prima di cadere sotto i colpi del padre. Infine Alessandro Maja uscì sul balcone, coperto di sangue, gridando \"li ho uccisi tutti, bastardi\". L'iter giudiziario è terminato I vicini di casa diedero l'allarme ma solo per Nicolò ci fu la disperata corsa in ospedale. Per lui, appena diplomato pilota di aereo, dopo un lungo coma e diversi interventi, è iniziata una lenta risalita per tornare a riprendere in mano la sua vita. Ad oggi il movente della tragedia non è mai stato esplicitato dallo stesso imputato. \"Per la famiglia Pivetta e per Nicolò si tratta di un sollievo - spiega l'avvocato Stefano Bettinelli, legale di parte civile -. L'iter giudiziario è finalmente terminato. Ed è terminato con la giusta pena per ciò che ha commesso Maja. I miei assistiti hanno sempre e solo chiesto giustizia. Quanto stabilito dalla Cassazione è il massimo che la giustizia possa restituire davanti a un fatto in realtà irrisarcibile dal punto di visto affettivo e umano\".",
