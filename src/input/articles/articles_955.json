    "title": "The AI Shift Reshaping Education Across Borders",
    "text": "Across the world, education is changing due to AI because traditional classrooms now use data to personalise learning for each student. With teachers using AI tutors and methods developed by GPT and students following adaptive paths, AI is helping shape learning and teaching practices and making it easier for institutions to tackle challenges like widening access, higher standards and running a smooth system.\nThis is a change occurring worldwide, affecting education systems in all nations from Estonia and South Korea to Ghana.\nPersonalised Learning is on the Rise Over time, a general way of teaching has dominated and this does not help students with different learning needs and rates. AI platforms and tutors are doing this by studying student data and customising each student’s learning experience.\nDeloitte’s report shows that 72% of schools around the world acknowledge AI could help with personalised learning and 60% plan to apply AI tools in the classroom in the next five years. Content, difficulty and pacing in these systems change to match the real-time results of students.\nKhan Academy’s AI assistant “Khanmigo” is a prime example, offering 24/7 personalized tutoring and assisting educators in designing tailored lesson plans. Just like in other apps, AI on Duolingo personalized lessons for students to remain interested and motivated at their own level.\nMcKinsey has found that learning personalized by AI boosts retention for students by 20 to 30%, raises test results by 10 to 15% and saves up to 30% of time on learning subjects. They show that AI speeds up and strengthens learning by delivering the correct information as needed to each student.\nAI Education Action Plans AI is being used in schools in Estonia, as the government has launched “AI Leap” with the aim to supply 58,000 students and 5,000 teachers with AI tools by 2027. AI-powered accounts will serve as guides throughout a student’s education, encouraging learning that works well with AI tools.\nOn China’s Squirrel AI, machine learning allows subjects to be divided into knowledge points and helps find out where students need help. Study plans are tailored to help students with those weaknesses. AI by Squirrel serves nearly a million students spread across 60,000 schools in Asia, showing how it is suitable for many students.\nSouth Korean students use GPTeens, a GPT-powered chatbot, for tutoring in subjects that match their curriculum. The app provides protection and filters so students can only interact in ways suited to their age, with instant individual support if needed.\nGhana takes advantage of AI by giving teachers local language resources and information that matches their culture. Educators are given resources that meet their needs and new teaching approaches which helps to solve educational issues in areas that are underserved.\nHelping Educators and Solving Problems Faced by the Workforce AI influences both student learning and plays a part in supporting teachers and better organising administrative tasks. Grade marking, attending students, developing lessons and report writing require a lot of teachers’ time.\nKPMG has revealed that using automation with AI can greatly reduce the administrative work teachers do, giving them more time for individual teaching and interacting with students.\nIn addition, AI provides recommendations for teacher training based on classroom information. This matters, as according to UNESCO, the world will have to hire 69 million new teachers by 2030 to provide quality education. This gap can be solved to a degree with the help of AI tools.\nIssues and Matter of Ethics Because AI systems depend on student information, privacy is becoming an important concern. GDPR and COPPA are laws that must be followed, though following them can be very hard. Having secure data, consent control and clear rule-following is essential to maintain the trust of everyone.\nGetting AI-supported learning requires access to devices, meaningful internet connection and the basic skills for using technology. Research by McKinsey indicates that about 30% of all students worldwide cannot use digital learning effectively and this may make educational inequality grow, mainly in countryside and poor regions.\nThe EY report for 2024 points out that 40% of teachers think they are not ready to fully utilize AI in their teaching. For AI to give its full benefits, we need to make sure people receive adequate training and support. It is absolutely necessary to keep learning new skills.\nWithout intervention, AI algorithms can contribute to the continuation of existing social inequalities. The two organisations say that using many types of data, making algorithms clear and doing audits regularly can help AI education solutions be fair and supportive of everyone.\nAI and Education Going Forward AI is opening up a time of personalised, fast and fair education across the globe. Because AI supports custom learning, automates tasks usually handled by staff and improves what teachers can do, it is likely to improve education in many settings.\nStill, being successful calls for balancing new ideas with looking after people’s privacy, fairness and making sure teachers are comfortable and the technology is not biased. Estonia, China, South Korea and Ghana have shown that AI works best when approaches are tailored to local situations.\nWorking as a team, policymakers, educators, technology providers and communities will help find solutions and utilise AI effectively. With AI, all students from any place and circumstance can get the chance to succeed and adjust to upcoming advancements.",

(EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl Consejo Evangélico Provincial y el Gobierno local del Ayuntamiento de Sevilla han celebrado una reunión, para retomar el protocolo general que se firmó el 3 de marzo de 2023 entre ambas partes.\nA esta reunión asistieron por parte del Ayuntamiento el concejal de Participación Ciudadana, Juan Bueno; y por parte del Consejo Evangélico Provincial Manuel Lauriño y Antonio Gordillo, presidente y vicepresidente respectivamente del mismo. También participó en esta reunión el Presidente del Consejo Evangélico Autonómico de Andalucía, José Manuel Marín.\nJosé Manuel Marín expuso al Ayuntamiento \"el malestar\" de la Comunidad Evangélica por las noticias de la cesión del Castillo de San Jorge como Museo del Arte Sacro, ya que \"fue lugar donde se realizaron actos de fe y donde la Inquisición impuso torturas y muertes a numerosos sevillanos evangélicos como Constantino Ponce de la Fuente y María de Bohorques\".\n\"El Castillo de San Jorge debe ser un espacio destinado a la memoria histórica, lugar de reflexión, estudio e investigación académica sobre la religión\", destaca el Consejo, cuyos miembros trasladaron además a Bueno \"la necesidad de retomar las iniciativas emanadas del protocolo firmado en el 2023, sobre todo la interlocución con el Ayuntamiento y la realización de los convenios específicos ejecutar las acciones sociales de las iglesias evangélicas de Sevilla\".\nAsimismo, informaron al Ayuntamiento de las dos actividades del Consejo Evangélico en Sevilla, como son \"El Día de la Resurrección\" y \"El Día del Evangelio\", que se desarrollan en Plaza Nueva desde hace más de 20 años, para los cuales se ha solicitado el apoyo del Ayuntamiento.",

    "text": "The role of educated mothers is crucial for the development of societies; a knowledgeable mother can easily educate and train her children well, and the home environment they create can ensure a well-educated and well-behaved family. These views were expressed by Dr Nauman Ahsan, director general of the Charter Inspection and Evaluation Committee of the Sindh Higher Education Commission. He was addressing the inaugural session of a seminar organized by the Centre of Excellence for Women’s Studies of the University of Karachi in collaboration with the KU Faculty of Law, KU Students’ Advisor Office, KU Office of Research Innovation and Commercialization, and the Sindh Higher Education Commission in connection with International Women’s Day 2024. He added that mothers maintain houses in order and have a major influence on a child, and their love and care can mould them into caring individuals or spoil their personalities. “We can witness that there is a lack of counselling, guidance, and training in the parental system in our society, and its effects are in front of us.” Ahsan said that Pakistanis break each and every rule and regulation, but as soon as they land on the soil of any other country, they are willing to obey and follow their rules without any hesitation. “We will not stand in queues and do not mind if we drive the wrong way on the streets in our motherland, but we cannot do the same in any foreign country, as we know what kind of reaction and punishment we will get there.” During his address, KU Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi said that countries cannot be developed without promoting gender equality and empowering women. He mentioned that the money spent on the education system is not an expense but an investment for the future, and without quality education, the country cannot achieve its goals. He shared that Pakistan’s founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, called education a matter of life and death. “Unfortunately, the education sector is not among the priorities of our rulers, and as a consequence, the entire nation is suffering today.” Iraqi observed that the country need to do more work to empower women. He said that women should have the freedom to make their own decisions about their future. He remarked that women are strong pillars of society and no civilized society can be developed without them. Dr Asma Ibrahim, director of the State Bank of Pakistan Museum, said that the purpose of coming into the world is not just to live but to do something that will remind one even after they leave the world. She stressed that there is a need to deal with challenges instead of running away from them. Sharing her life experiences with the audience, she mentioned that if one decides to achieve their goal, no setback can stop them from succeeding. Professor Dr Shaista Tabassum, KU Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, said that Islam has given rights to women which are unmatched by any other society. Dr Syeda Hoorul-Ain, KU director of the Office of Research Innovation and Commercialization, said that the education of a man is only the education of an individual, but educating a woman is educating the whole family. She noted that in the country, women are progressing rapidly in the field of education. “We can progress only by empowering women. Today, women are developing their skills in every field of life.” Dr Nosheen Raza, KU students’ advisor, said that thanks to the struggle of women around the world, women’s rights and gender equality are rapidly improving, but they still face hardships in Third World countries.

    "text": "Videos by OutKick\nMontana State went above and beyond to help their rivals –\nMontana – prepare for the FC Championship game. It ended up being a terrible decision.\nThe Grizzlies faced the South Dakota State Jackrabbits in the FCS Championship game in Frisco, Texas. However, Montana couldn’t find enough funding to get their matching band to the Lone Star State for the game.\nThat’s not a good look on the Grizzlies alumni base. The marching band plays a big part in igniting school spirit at any sporting events. It’s embarrassing that not enough Montana graduates could pool enough money together to get the band to Frisco for their first FCS Championship appearance since 2001.\nHowever, the Grizzlies got help from an unlikely place. Their rivals chipped in the necessary funds to get the band to Texas.\n“Our marching bands work tirelessly to cheer on our teams and fill our fans with spirit!” Montana State\nannounced via social media. “We stand together as one Montana community. MSU is wishing you all the best in Frisco!”\nMind you, these schools despise each other on the field. Their rivalry dates back all the way to 1897, which was two years before Montana even became a state. If you think Michigan would have done this for Ohio State, or Alabama for Auburn, you’re kidding yourself. Even so, Montana State showed some incredible class and helped their rivals out in a pinch.\nNeedless to say, the band was quite excited to have a chance to perform in Frisco.\nBut that excitement didn’t last too long.\nTurns Out Montana State Didn’t Help Much By Donating\nMontana never led in a 23-3 loss to the Jackrabbits. The closest they ever came to leading (other than the start of the game) came after a 30-yard field goal from Nico Ramos to make it 7-3 in the second quarter. After that, South Dakota State smothered the Grizzlies offense, only surrendering 259 total yards the whole day. Turns out the Grizzlies band didn’t have much to cheer about all game long.\nThings got so ugly that Jackrabbits wide receiver Jadon Janke was hitting the “Too Small” celebration just inches away from Grizzlies defenders.\nSo did the Montana band get the experience of a lifetime by heading to Frisco? Absolutely. But they didn’t get the chance to affect the game through their enthusiasm all that often.\nAs such, this will likely go down as one of – if not the – worst investments in Montana State history. And it came in an effort to help a rival, no less.",

    "text": "How two Afghan sisters are fighting the Taliban through music\nNEW DELHI: Two sisters in Kabul found themselves at the forefront of the Taliban’s tightening grip on women’s freedoms in Afghanistan through music, reported BBC.\nDespite the risks involved in a country where musicians can be arrested, the sisters initiated a singing movement on social media called the Last Torch.\nIn a recorded video, one of the sisters said, “We’re going to sing this but it could cost us our lives,” before they commenced their melody. Released in August 2021, just days after the Taliban takeover, their song quickly went viral on platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp.\nDespite lacking any background in music, the sisters, who concealed their identities by wearing burkas, became a musical phenomenon. Shaqayeq (name changed for safety), the younger sister, explained, “Our fight started from right under the flag of the Taliban and against the Taliban,” says Shaqayeq (not her real name), the younger member of the duo. Before the Taliban came to power, we had never written a single poem. This is what the Taliban did to us.”\nThe Taliban imposed Sharia, Islamic religious law, on everyday life and severely restricting women’s access to education soon after they came to power in August 2021. Women in Kabul and other major cities took to the streets in resistance, only to face a brutal crackdown. “Women were the last light of hope we could see. “That’s why we decided to call ourselves the Last Torch. Thinking that we wouldn’t be able to go anywhere, we decided to start a secret protest from home,” said Shaqayeq.\nThe sisters continued to release songs, all sung from beneath their blue burkas, just like the first one. One of these songs was a famous poem by the late Nadia Anjuman, written in protest against the Taliban’s initial takeover in 1996. It expressed the frustration of being silenced and yearning for freedom.\nDescribing the burka, the older sister, Mashal (name changed for safety), compared it to a “mobile cage” and lamented, “It’s like a graveyard where the dreams of thousands of women and girls are buried.” Shaqayeq added, “This burka is like a stone that the Taliban threw on women 25 years ago, and they did it again when they returned to power. We wanted to use the weapon they used against us to fight back against their restrictions.”\nAlthough the sisters have only released seven songs to date, each one has resonated strongly with women across Afghanistan. Initially, they used lyrics written by others, but eventually felt that no poem could adequately express their emotions, prompting them to start writing their own. Their songs address the limitations imposed on women’s lives, the imprisonment of activists, and the violations of human rights. Fans have responded by posting their own performances of the songs on social media, sometimes even donning burkas as a disguise. A group of Afghan school students living abroad recorded a version on stage in their school auditorium.\nThis defiance by women goes against the Taliban’s intentions. One of the first measures taken by the Taliban after seizing power was to replace the Ministry of Women’s Affairs with the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. The new ministry not only enforced the wearing of burkas but also condemned music, claiming it destroys the roots of Islam. Sawabgul, an official featured in one of the ministry’s propaganda videos, asserted, “Singing and listening to music is very harmful. It distracts people from God’s prayers… Everyone should stay away from it.” Videos soon emerged on social media showing Taliban foot soldiers burning musical instruments and parading arrested musicians.\nThe sisters, aware of the potential danger, have experienced many sleepless nights fearing that the Taliban might identify them. “We have seen their threats on social media: ‘Once we find you, we know how to remove your tongue from your throat,'” said Mashal. “Our parents get scared whenever they read these comments. They say maybe it’s enough and we should stop… But we tell them we can’t, we cannot just continue with our normal lives.” For their safety, the sisters left Afghanistan last year, but they hope to return soon.\nSonita Alizada, a professional rapper from Afghanistan now residing in Canada, has been inspired by the Last Torch’s videos. “When I saw two women under a burka singing, honestly, I was crying,” she expressed. Born in 1996, the year the Taliban first took power, Sonita’s family fled to Iran when she was a child. There, her mother attempted to arrange a forced marriage for her, but Sonita found solace in music and escaped her fate. Like the sisters, she sees the women who have protested against the Taliban as symbols of hope.\nSonita said “We see individuals fighting with their own talent.” Farida Mahwash, one of Afghanistan’s most celebrated female singers, who recently retired after a career spanning over half a century, watched one of the sisters’ latest songs on the BBC. She remarked, “these two singers will turn four and then become 10, and then 1,000. If one day they go on stage, I’ll walk with them, even if I have to use a walking stick.”\nIn Kabul, the crackdown on activism has intensified over the past year, with authorities banning women from holding rallies and arresting those who defy the ban. One of the sisters’ recent songs focuses on female activists who were imprisoned by the Taliban, enduring what Human Rights Watch described as “abusive conditions.”\n“These poems are just a small part of the grief and pain we have in our hearts,” Shaqayeq acknowledges. “The pain and struggle of the people of Afghanistan, and the grief they have endured under the Taliban in the last years, can’t fit in any poem.” The UN has warned that the Taliban’s current policies could lead to gender apartheid. In response, the Taliban asserts that they are simply implementing Sharia and will not tolerate outside interference.\nShaqayeq and Mashal are currently working on their next songs, aiming to amplify the voices of women in Afghanistan who are fighting for freedom. “Our voice won’t be silenced. We are not tired. It’s just the beginning of our fight.”\n(Note: Sisters’ names have been changed for safety)\nFor more news like this visit TOI.
