    "text": "El Mercado Común del Sur (Mercosur) emitió un comunicado en el cual se pronuncia por los hechos que se dan en Bolivia y que están protagonizados por algunas unidades del ejército de dicho país. El bloque hizo un llamado al respeto de la democracia y extienden su solidaridad al gobierno boliviano legítimamente electo. “Los Estados partes del Mercosur y Estados asociados manifiestan su profunda preocupación y enérgica condena por las movilizaciones de algunas unidades del ejército boliviano, tendientes a desestabilizar el gobierno democrático del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, incumpliendo los principios internacionales de la vida democrática y, en particular, del Mercosur”, reza el comunicado. El escrito fue difundido este jueves 27 de junio y afirma que rechazan cualquier intento de cambiar al poder por vía de la violencia y la inconstitucionalidad, los cuales atentan contra la voluntad popular que es la voz soberana de los pueblos. Estos hechos vulneran la estabilidad política y social de Bolivia, según manifestaron.

Un intento de golpe de Estado fue denunciado por el presidente Arce en la tarde del miércoles 26 de junio, cuando varias unidades del ejército tomaron la Plaza Murillo, ubicada en La Paz, liderados por el general Juan José Zúñiga, quien recientemente había sido destituido. Pese a que el levantamiento militar fue controlado, en el país aún persiste la incertidumbre.

    "text": "„Cape „Chervenka“ in the municipality of Sozopol is among the largest properties that the Council of Ministers included in the list of state-owned land with no longer needed. Here we see another example of how the state has not done its job in preparing this list of over 4,400 properties.“\nThis was stated by the co-chairman of „Yes, Bulgaria“ Bozhidar Bozhanov, who visited Cape Chervenka today, the party's press center reported. The MP revealed that there are many restitution claims and pending cases regarding Cape Chervenka that have not been completed. Bozhidar Bozhanov added that archaeological excavations are being carried out on the property. There is also a fortress there, which could turn out to be a tourist attraction.\n„This entire analysis should have been done by the relevant ministry, which intends to dispose of this property. This work has not been done. This property was uploaded, then taken down from the MRDPW website, and the local people think: „Here, now it will be sold.“ Not that the Council of Ministers necessarily said this, but because of their poor communication and the incomplete analysis, there are more questions than answers,” said Bozhanov.\nAccording to the co-chairman of „Yes, Bulgaria“, in principle, initiatives to sell state-owned properties that are truly no longer necessary are positive. The party will insist on an adequate analysis of the need and potential solutions for the specific properties. “If necessary, the fortress should be separated from the rest, the parts that are subject to restitution claims should be separated and then proceed to subsequent actions,“ added Bozhidar Bozhanov.",

    "text": "Nitesh Tiwari’s highly-anticipated epic tale- Ramayana is touted as the biggest Indian film ever made. Reason? Its staggering budget, exceptional VFX and terrific star-studded cast. Film’s producer Namit Malhotra recently talked about the ambitious film and its budget. He revealed that all the production and marketing for both the installments of the film (Ramayana Part 1 and Ramayana Part 2) are done, and the costing is nothing less than staggering $500-million (Rs 4000 crore). Yes its unbelievable but true! The figure is higher than many Hollywood and Bollywood classics, naturally rising more than a few eyebrows.\nIndia’s most expensive film Interacting on The Prakhar Gupta Xperience podcast, Namit said, “When we set out to make it, 6-7 years ago, when we really got serious about mounting it, everybody called me a lunatic, because no Indian film comes close to it budgetwise. To put it simply, it will be about $500 million by the time we are done with both the films – Part 1 and Part 2, which is over Rs 4000 crore.”\nHe added, “We are making the largest film in the world for the greatest story the world should see. I still think it is cheaper than some of the big Hollywood films. I think we are making a bigger film at a lower cost. That Indian in me still believes we are not being irresponsible with money.”\nWill Ramayana soar or sink? Since the $500-million budget would mean that each of the two Ramayana films are assumed to earn $1 billion at the box office. These numbers have been scored by only global hits like Avatar, Avengers, Fast franchise etc. There is no Indian film that has ever grossed over Rs 2000 crore. In 2017, Nitesh Tiwari’s Dangal grossed Rs 2000 crore, but over Rs 1300 crore came Internationally, specifically from China. The other highest-grossing Indian films like Pushpa 2: The Rise and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion , grossed over Rs 1700 crore worldwide.\nMoreover the makers will be using strong VFX for the larger-than-life theatrical experience. If the poor execution of visual effects or storytelling occur, it can affect the viewing experience and the film might appear cheap.\nRamayana film must be handled with cultural sensitivity. If the film doesn’t resonate with the audience or capture the attention of the modern viewers, it can lead to negative views or box office disappointment.\nMore about Ramayana Ramayana stars Ranbir Kapoor as Lord Ram, Yash as Ravana, Sai Pallavi as Sita, Ravi Dubey as Lakshman, and Sunny Deol as Hanuman. Also, supporting the powerful cast is an extraordinary crew. For the first time, Music maestro AR Rahman will collaborate with the legendary Hans Zimmer, to craft a new cinematic symphony. Helmed by Nitesh Tiwari and bankrolled by Namit Malhotra’s Prime Focus Studios and Yash’s Monster Mind Creations, Ramayana Part 1 is scheduled for a release on Diwali 2026, and the second part on Diwali 2027.",

    "text": "National Security Conference shapes graduate's vision for Australia's future Helen Argyris will walk on the stage today, receiving a [Graduate Certificate of National Security Policy](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/CNSEP). It adds to an impressive collection of both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, intending to use her new skills to work as a policy officer for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Helen is an Australian but grew up abroad in a small town in Greece. She came to study in Australia at 23, leaving all her friends and family behind, with a background in STEM, aiming to completely change her career path. She started with a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Melbourne, having also now completed a Master of International Relations at the University of Melbourne. She also studied International Human Rights Law and International Humanitarian Law courses at the University of Oxford before her enrolment at the National Security College (NSC) within the Crawford School of Public Policy. She says, “During both my undergraduate and postgraduate courses, I have volunteered for many organisations where I had the opportunity to propose recommendations and implement initiatives that would help people coming from diverse backgrounds to be included and their voices be heard on local, national, regional, and international level.” “I decided to study this course [Graduate Certificate of National Security Policy] to explore national security concepts and practical policy skills, focusing on navigating the Australian security landscape.” The course is designed with the understanding that national security will grow increasingly crucial in a complex and contested geopolitical landscape. Developing the ability to critically analyse its role in emerging challenges will be essential for the future. This is particularly useful with Helen’s love of international law. She said, “It is important to understand how national security laws and policies can assist in protecting human rights, particularly rights relating to the safety and individual freedoms but also the challenges to the enjoyment and fulfilment of those rights and provide the necessary policies to address them.” Helen added that policymakers need to better understand the inter-relationships between the different forms of actors, what some of the challenges are in efforts to achieve a whole-of-nation engagement, and the realities of progress towards such an engagement, especially in addressing national security challenges. For those considering studying at the NSC, “I would suggest taking every opportunity that Crawford and NSC offer, especially in terms of networking as they can take you to the most unexpected yet interesting and thought-provoking places.” One of Helen’s most memorable experiences during her studies was her participation in the NSC Conference “Securing our future.” At the conference, she engaged in interdisciplinary dialogues with thought leaders and decision-makers from government, academia, industry, and the community. Together, they worked towards shaping a distinctly Australian, people-centered vision of national security, focusing on resilience and national interests. Regarding her future, Helen intends to maintain her position with the Australian Government while contributing to a climate change accountability project for the Law Students for Climate Accountability Australia. Additionally, she recently finished her volunteer position as a Resource Development and Fundraising mentor for the Australian Volunteers program. She also wants to apply for the Master of National Security Policy to examine other areas of present and future risk, from climate change, and terrorism to Indo-Pacific geopolitical tensions. Despite all of this, she credits her success to her family. “I would have not been here without the unconditional support from my mother, Athina, and my two sisters Mary and Constantina who have overcome their obstacles to keep me going forward, especially during unprecedented and difficult times. I am very grateful as every form of support either big or small is very important,” Helen said. Congratulations on graduating Helen! We hope to see you at Crawford studying for your Master of National Security Policy degree soon.

    "title": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham",
    "text": "Arsenal lose to West Ham and miss chance to return to Premier League summit The Gunners went down 2-0 at home Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy. The Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 on a night where Hammers boss David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium. West Ham lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up. A second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya. Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot. Arsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table. Instead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances. Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular. But at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle. Jarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback. Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola. Paqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller. The hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle. Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after. Mavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour. Jesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench. Areola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner. Rice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",
