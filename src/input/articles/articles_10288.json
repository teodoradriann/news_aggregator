    "text": "WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — American forces carried out strikes in Yemen against 10 attack drones and a ground control station belonging to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the US military said Wednesday.\nA US warship also shot down an\nanti-ship missile fired by the Houthis and later downed three Iranian drones, Central Command said.\nWhile the US has recently launched strikes on the Houthis and other\nTehran-supported groups in the region, both it and Iran have sought to avoid a direct confrontation, and the downing of three Iranian drones could heighten tensions.\nEarly on Thursday local time, US forces targeted a “Houthi UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) ground control station and 10 Houthi one-way UAVs” that “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region,” CENTCOM said in a statement.\nCENTCOM earlier announced that the USS Carney had shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Houthis, and then downed three Iranian drones less than an hour later.\nIt did not specify if the drones shot down by the naval destroyer were designed for attack or surveillance.\nAmerican forces also destroyed a Houthi surface-to-air missile on Wednesday that CENTCOM said posed an imminent threat to “US aircraft” — a deviation from past air raids that focused on reducing the rebels’ ability to threaten international shipping.\nIt did not identify the type of aircraft that were threatened or the exact location of the strike, only saying that it took place in “Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.”\nThe Houthis began targeting Red Sea shipping in November, saying they were hitting Israeli-linked vessels in support of Palestinians in Gaza, which has been ravaged by the Israel-Hamas war.\nUS and United Kingdom forces have responded with strikes on the Houthis, who have since declared American and British interests to be legitimate targets as well.\nThe rebels said Wednesday that they targeted an American merchant ship bound for Israel with “several appropriate naval missiles that directly hit the vessel.”\nMaritime security firm Ambrey said a commercial vessel was reportedly targeted with a missile southwest of Aden, and that the ship reported an explosion on its starboard side, but did not mention its nationality.",

    "title": "War in Gaza ends effort by Netanyahu's government to overhaul the judiciary",
    "text": "Before the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Israel's government was in the process of trying to overhaul its judiciary, which many Israelis opposed. The plan's opponents say they haven't let down their guard.\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST:\nThe war in Gaza is reshaping Israeli politics. It ended an effort by Benjamin Netanyahu's government to overhaul the judiciary, which many in Israel saw as an attempt to break the country's democracy. But as NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from Jerusalem, some who protested the legislation worry the threat could return.\nFRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: This year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government pushed for something called judicial reform. It was a dry-sounding package of legislation that convulsed the country. Many Israelis were so worried about the impact on their democracy...\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\nLANGFITT: ...They took to the streets in the hundreds of thousands. It was a political awakening, and one of the architects of the reform is Simcha Rothman. And he has this message.\nSIMCHA ROTHMAN: When you talk about the judicial reform, I think it's dead.\nLANGFITT: Rothman chairs the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee in the Knesset, Israel's Parliament. This is a huge about-face. But Rothman says with the country at war, it's time for unity.\nROTHMAN: I hope and I'm certain that when the soldiers and their families will come back from the war, they will look at their elected officials and they will say, please stop stupid fights.\nLANGFITT: Many still distrust this government and fear that when the war ends, it could try again. Itzhak Berke (ph) is a retired university professor I met at a recent anti-government rally in Tel Aviv.\nITZHAK BERKE: Until they're gone from power, nothing is dead. They're working on it constantly.\nLANGFITT: Critics say the government wants to control the courts to erode minority rights, make it harder to fight official corruption and pave the way for the annexation of the West Bank. And the fights aren't over. The government, which includes conservative religious parties, is still jockeying for control over Supreme Court appointments, according to Israeli media. This infuriates Gigi Levy-Weiss.\nGIGI LEVY-WEISS: Have we learned nothing?\nLANGFITT: Levy-Weiss is a well-known venture capitalist and a member of Brothers and Sisters in Arms, a group of military reservists who helped lead this year's pro-democracy protests.\nLEVY-WEISS: How can it be that you're still thinking about how do I get what I want in this period? And the answer is that I think this is a government that is not thinking about its people. This is a government that is still busy with power grabs.\nNOA SATTATH: My name is Noa Sattath and I am the executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.\nLANGFITT: Which is essentially Israel's ACLU. The government claims it wants to reform the judiciary because the institution is unaccountable. But Sattath says the real goal is to weaken the court's ability to challenge government and parliamentary action.\nSATTATH: The idea was to remove the checks and balances, which were very poor to begin with, and permit any government legislation.\nLANGFITT: Sattath says the system here is vulnerable to these kinds of tactics.\nSATTATH: In Israel, we have no constitution, we have only one house of Parliament. We have a very, very weak separation between the executive branch and the legislative branch. So the judicial system is really the main or even the only check and balance on government power.\nLANGFITT: And Sattath says the government is working on at least several dozen other bills to undermine the democratic system. In Israel, candidates can be banned from running for office if they've expressed support for terrorism. Sattath worries that the government will try to expand the definition of support to disqualify Palestinian political leaders.\nSATTATH: To ban some of the political representation would be disastrous both in the sense that it would change the political system altogether, but also because any minority that is not represented becomes radicalized.\nLANGFITT: So much has changed in Israel since October 7, including Brothers and Sisters in Arms. On the day of the attack, the group pivoted away from protests against the judicial overhaul and rushed to rescue survivors. Like other volunteer groups, Brothers and Sisters filled a vacuum in the early days of the war, when the government was not only caught by surprise but also slow to respond. Ronen Kohler (ph) is a former submarine captain and a founding member of the group. He says Brothers and Sisters has created 25 kindergartens and hotels where war evacuees are living.\nRONEN KOHLER: Essentially, it's a room in the hotel that we equipped with toys and, you know, padded walls. And we hired a teacher. It's not very expensive, it's not very complicated.\nLANGFITT: And Kohler says members of Brothers and Sisters are thinking about other ways that they can affect change in Israel.\nKOHLER: I think what I really would like to see is having some of our people as part of the Knesset.\nLANGFITT: Running for office?\nKOHLER: Running for office. I think it's inevitable because this is the practical, pragmatic way to influence.\nLANGFITT: Such is the political evolution here in Israel. What many say began as a government attempt to undermine democracy may now inspire people to challenge that same government at the ballot box. Elections could come as early as next year.\nFrank Langfitt, NPR News, Jerusalem.\n ",

    "text": "Massive swell strikes US West Coast and Hawaii, triggering flooding Storm-driven waves lash West Coast and Hawaii, triggering flooding and evacuations; residents cautioned to stay vigilant amid high surf warnings. Powerful surf has rolled onto beaches on the West Coast and Hawaii as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed toward shorelines, causing localised flooding. Forecasters on Thursday urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach. A high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 8.5 to 10 meters and up to 12 meters at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas. In Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate. “Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. \"I mean, these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.” Southern California hit by hazardous waves The same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers. “I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident. While not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn't resist. Patience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast. “I was waiting for a while because the waves were really sick, and they're kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one, and I got it, and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.” In Hawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 9 to 12 meters along north-facing shores and 5.5 to 6.7 meters along west-facing shores of five islands. Professional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side. Paishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till Friday morning. “It’s always big waves in the winter time in Hawaii,” he said. He warned that novice surfers should check with lifeguards before heading into the water and “make sure you got some people around you and stay safe.” Honolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards, posted at beaches across Oahu, rescued 20 people along the island’s famed North Shore on Wednesday, said spokesperson Shayne Enright. They were also busy with thousands of “preventative actions,” she said. “This time of year produces incredible surf but it can also be very dangerous,” she said. The dangerous surf could also cause surges that could hit coastal properties and roadways, the weather service warned.",
