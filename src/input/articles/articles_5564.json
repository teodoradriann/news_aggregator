    "title": "Indian Army JCO, Who Was Abducted From Manipur's Thoubal District, Rescued By Security Forces | India News, Times Now",
    "text": "Thoubal: A serving Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) of the Indian Army, who was abducted from his home in Manipur's Thoubal district by anti-social elements on Friday morning, was rescued by security forces in the evening, sources said.The JCO, identified as Konsam Kheda Singh, a resident of Charangpat Mamang Leikai, is currently at Waikhong police station (near Kakching) in Thoubal district. Police are investigating the incident, they added.According to sources, a coordinated search operation was launched by all security agencies to rescue the JCO which ultimately led to his safe release at 6.30 pm. Singh, who was currently on leave, was abducted around 9am after some people barged into his home and bundled him in a vehicle and fled.Though the cause of the abduction is not known, reports suggest that it was an extortion case as his family had received such threats in the past, officials said. This was the fourth incident since the commencement of the conflict in Manipur wherein soldiers while on leave, on duty or their relatives have been targeted for nefarious interests by inimical elements.In September 2023, a former Assam Regiment soldier Serto Thangthang Kom was kidnapped and killed by an unidentified armed group from the valley. He was posted in Manipur's Leimakhong with the Defence Service Corps (DSC).Two months later, an unidentified armed group kidnapped four people while they were travelling in an SUV from the hill district Churachandpur to Leimakhong, and killed them. The four were family members of an Indian Army soldier serving in Jammu and Kashmir.A fifth passenger, the father of the soldier, who was injured, managed to escape and was later airlifted by the army to Dimapur for treatment. He was eventually shifted to the base hospital in Guwahati, Assam.An Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) from Manipur Police was attacked in his house in Imphal city on February 27. The attackers in this case were identified as Arambai Tenggol (AT), a radical Meitei group.Following the incident, police commandos of Manipur laid down their arms in Imphal and other areas. The open defiance of discipline in the police ranks on the morning of the commencement of the state assembly (February 28, 2024) prompted Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh to visit the police officer in the hospital and also hold discussions with the senior police officials to address their grievances.Manipur Police also published a statement blaming the notorious group AT for the attack and warned all miscreants to refrain from such acts and indicating that prevalence of such conditions will result in reimposition of AFSPA in the valley.The security forces toiling day and night for early restoration of peace and normalcy are being targeted for performing their duty, the officials said, adding the attacks by the inimical elements on security forces and their families need to be strongly condemned and perpetrators caught and punished as per the law.At least 219 people have been killed in the ethnic strife in the state that started on May 3 last year after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts.",

    "text": "研究指出，每天瞓多1小時，3年就能成功減重12KG，輕鬆實現「躺著就能瘦」的願望。\n減肥效果不佳恐與「睡眠不足」有關\n隨著夏季臨近，不少人會開始勤加鍛鍊減肥以此展示好身材，但常常發現減肥效果不如預期。研究揭示，這可能與「睡眠不足」有關。足夠的睡眠實際上對減肥非常有幫助，因此改善睡眠質量可能是提高減肥效果的關鍵。\n適當延長睡眠時間對能量攝取與消耗有關\n一項於2022年發表於《美國醫學會雜誌》的研究發現，適當延長睡眠時間對於能量攝取、能量消耗與體重有重要影響。研究招募了80名日常睡眠少於6.5小時的超重或肥胖成年人，年齡介於21至40歲，身體質量指數（BMI）介於25.0至29.9之間，並隨機分成2組。第1組「延長睡眠組」睡覺時間被延長至8.5小時，而第2組「對照組」則維持原有的睡眠習慣。\n每天睡多1小時可減少約270大卡\n實驗結果顯示，「延長睡眠組」的成員平均每晚增加約1.2小時的睡眠時間，每日能量攝取量減少了約270大卡，最終導致體重下降。因此，研究證實每天增加1小時睡眠，能量攝取減少約270大卡，3年體重就可以減輕約12KG，實現「躺著就能瘦」的願望。\n睡眠激素Raptin有助抑制食慾控制體重\n有觀點認為睡多可能會發胖，不過中南大學湘雅醫院等研究人員於2025年1月在《細胞研究》期刊發表的一項研究指出，一種名為「Raptin」的新型睡眠激素能在睡眠過程中抑制食慾，但睡眠不足會抑制此激素的釋放，進而影響體重控制。\nRaptin激素不足導致食慾高且代謝紊亂\n研究人員透過實驗鼠注射Raptin激素後發現，這種激素可以明顯抑制進食行為並降低體重。反之，缺乏Raptin激素會讓實驗鼠表現出較高的食慾、更快遞增加體重以及導致代謝紊亂。",

JOHANNESBURG - At least 18 people have lost their lives in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) due to flash floods and adverse weather. The number is expected to climb to almost 30 in the coming days as the search for missing flood victims continues in the hardest-hit town of Ladysmith. ALSO READ: [Ladysmith flooding death toll rises as more bodies recovered](https://ewn.co.za/0001/01/01/ladysmith-flooding-death-toll-rises-as-more-bodies-recovered) Fourteen people were killed and 10 remain unaccounted for in the town after the banks of the Bellspuit River burst, resulting in a flash flood on Christmas Eve. KZN Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesperson Sboniso Mngadi said overall, 18 people in the province lost their lives in drowning-related incidents since Sunday. \"These include the incidents that were reported in Mandeni, where an eight-year-old child drowned. There were also two incidents reported in Danhauser, and another incident in Dundee.\" Mngadi cautioned residents to remain vigilant, as more rain is predicted in the province in the coming days. \"According to the reports from SA Weather Service, it indicates that there will be more rains in the province over the weekend.\" In April last year, KZN experienced one of the worst natural disasters in South African history, when 448 people lost their lives, and tens of thousands were displaced following flooding and landslides.",

    "title": "Jalen Milroe calls out former OC Bill O'Brien for terrible evaluation",
    "text": "Alabama's Jalen Milroe revealed that former offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien told him he couldn't play quarterback.\nBy Scott Rogust | 5:18 PM EST\nNov 25, 2023; Auburn, Alabama, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe (4) drops back to / John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\nIt wasn't an easy season for the Alabama Crimson Tide , but they are now one of four teams vying for the National Championship. Alabama defied the odds, overcoming an early season loss to the Texas Longhorns and handing the Georgia Bulldogs their only loss of the year in the SEC Championship Game to earn the No. 4 seed in the College Football Playoff.\nThe Crimson Tide's trip to the Playoff can be attributed to the play of quarterback Jalen Milroe, who overcame a benching early in the season to play some incredible football in the team's final five games of the season.\nOn Thursday, Milroe and other members of the Alabama football program spoke with reporters just days before their Rose Bowl matchup against the No. 1 Michigan Wolverines. During his conference with the press, Milroe revealed that his former offensive coordinator at Alabama, Bill O'Brien, once told him that he shouldn't play quarterback.\nAlabama QB Jalen Milroe says his former OC and current Patriots OC Bill O'Brien told him he should not be a quarterback.\n\"How would you feel if I told you that you sucked?\"\n\"Look where I'm at right now. So who gets the last laugh?\" pic.twitter.com/xurEAr61ge\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 28, 2023 \"He told me a bunch of positions I could have switched to, but look where I'm at right now,\" said Milroe. \"So who gets the last laugh?\"\nJalen Milroe says he has 'last laugh' over Bill O'Brien after former OC suggested position change A reporter asked him to elaborate on how he felt at the time when O'Brien told him that, to which the quarterback responded, \"How would you feel if I told you that you sucked?\"\n\"The biggest thing for me is to be true to myself, and stay the same,\" said Milroe. \"Nothing changed about me. The only thing that changed about me was I had the opportunity and I seized it. For me, the biggest thing was just stay true to myself and add a bigger purpose to anyone's opinion.\"\nO'Brien left the Alabama football program after the 2022 season, just two years as their offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He is now the OC for the New England Patriots, where he was tasked with \"fixing\" former Alabama quarterback Mac Jones. O'Brien has been unsuccessful, as Jones was benched multiple times in favor of Bailey Zappe, while the Patriots are 4-11 on the year as of this writing and eliminated from playoff contention.\nMilroe had the unenviable position of trying to fill the shoes left by Bryce Young, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2021. Milroe was benched after the team's Week 2 loss to Texas in favor of Tyler Buchner, who was a quarterback for new offensive coordinator Tommy Rees. Milroe was reinstated as the starter one week later after Buchner struggled. Yet, as seen throughout this season, the benching didn't rattle Milroe, and he stepped up in the biggest games of the season.\nThere was the regular-season finale, the Iron Bowl against the Auburn Tigers. With the team trailing 24-20 with less than a minute remaining, Milroe heaved up a 31-yard Hail Mary pass, which hit the waiting arms of wide receiver Isaiah Bond to give Alabama the 27-24 victory.\nThen, the SEC Championship Game against Georgia, who had not lost a game since Alabama did so on Dec. 4, 2021. Milroe threw two touchdown passes in the second quarter to Jam Miller and Jermaine Burton to give the Crimson Tide the 17-7 lead entering halftime. Alabama would go on to win 27-24 to win the SEC Championship for the 30th time in program history.\nNow, Milroe has the chance to show the world what he can do on New Year's Day at one of the most famous stadiums in college football. All that's standing in their way are the Wolverines, who boast a dominant defense. But Milroe showed what he can do against top defenses this season. He will look to lead Alabama to a National Championship win for the first time since the 2020 campaign.\nMassive Jim Harbaugh Michigan extension offer kills any NFL team’s dreams. dark. Next.

    "text": "Lo que para muchos es una diversión, para otras tantas personas es un auténtico calvario. Es el caso de María Cara, una niña de Jaén con Síndrome 22q11, que teme por encima de todas las cosas el ruido que provocan las detonaciones de petardos y cohetes. En navidades, son muchos los jiennenses los que aún se divierten haciendo sonar elementos de pirotecnia en las calles de Jaén, algo que provoca pavor en María. Desde muy pequeña, María temía la llegada de fechas señaladas como esta, y es que ese estruendo resuena en su cabeza de forma distinta a otras personas. Su familia protege cada año a la pequeña, pero es casi imposible salvar los días centrales de la Navidad sin disgustos. Elena Escuderos, madre de María, explica a esta redacción que “la Nochebuena la pasamos regular”. Conocen la normativa actual, la cual prohíbe la detonación de estos petardos de forma habitual, pero sí lo permite en algunas jornadas navideñas. Elena comenta que “en la mañana del 24 de diciembre, María sabe que se pueden tirar petardos y ya está en tensión todo el día. En el momento que escucha uno, ella se esconde en el servicio, no quiere salir, algo que nos dificulta mucho que podamos salir a cenar con la familia”. Su padre, José Luis Cara, explica que “ella no puede gestionar ese miedo por su síndrome. Lo que para algunas personas es una diversión, para ella es un sufrimiento. Un sufrimiento que, aunque podamos contar, la gente no puede imaginar. Entra en pánico, se encierra en una habitación y no consiente salir. Este año ha sido ‘light’, pero otros años nos hemos quedado sin comer las uvas incluso”, explica. Comentan que llevan mucho tiempo intentando resolver esta cuestión con su psicóloga, pero es algo que va muy lento. Dicen que incluso su médico ha tenido que recetarle medicación para hacer más llevaderos estos momentos de angustia. Ante esta situación, la familia envía un mensaje a la sociedad jienense, pidiendo que piensen en su caso y en el de otras personas, pues “la diversión de una persona termina cuando empiezas a hacer daño a otra”. Por ello, insisten a las administraciones que traten este asunto y pongan remedio para dejar atrás el mencionado sufrimiento. Su padre afirma que las administraciones pueden tener buena voluntad, pero la gente incumple la normativa. Por último, José Luis Cara explica que su hija genera un sentimiento de culpa al no poder gestionar “ese sufrimiento tan grande”.

Bitcoin｜貴州前大數據局長被雙開 遭謠傳用政府伺服器挖1.5億「私礦」 即時中國 更新時間：13:11 2025-08-14 HKT\n發佈時間：13:11 2025-08-14 HKT 字體大小 貴州前大數據發展管理局局長景亞萍，被指利用職權將政府的伺服器改為私人比特幣礦場，2020至2024年間共挖出327枚比特幣，時值1.5億人民幣，現價更達11.67億，可在貴州買下2000套新房。近日，她因涉嫌嚴重職務違法被雙開。不過，貴州省紀委監委宣傳部澄清， 景亞萍「挖私礦」是謠言，其涉及案情與比特幣無關。\n據多間內媒13日爆料景亞萍犯罪細節。報道指，景亞萍政府的伺服器改為私人比特幣礦場，挖出327枚比特幣。\n貴州省紀委監委宣傳部工作人員向中國新聞週刊表示，景亞萍利用政府伺服器挖出327枚比特幣的消息「是謠言」。據其瞭解，景亞萍的案情並不涉及比特幣。\n８月初被「雙開」的景亞萍，其犯案細節近日曝光。網圖 不過，此消息事後被證實是假新聞。最初發稿的西南某媒體人員指，已刪除相關稿件，指消息最初是一些自媒體利用AI（人工智慧）生成的，目的是博流量。後來被一家媒體報道了，相關部門已就此事進行了溝通。\n資料顯示，景亞萍生於1964年，籍貫四川富順，出生地貴州遵義，長期在貴州省工作，早年曾任高校教師，後來擔任過貴州理工學院副院長、貴州省巨量資料發展管理局局長等職。\n今年2月，景亞萍涉嫌嚴重違紀違法被查。今年8月初，景亞萍被開除黨籍和公職。\n官方通報指出，景亞萍喪失理想信念，背棄初心使命，無視中央八項規定精神，收受可能影響公正執行公務的禮品，將應由本人支付的費用交由他人支付；違背組織原則，不如實報告個人有關事項；貪慾膨脹，大搞權錢交易，利用職務上的便利為他人在項目審批、項目承接等方面謀取利益，非法收受巨額財物。\n通報還提到，景亞萍嚴重違反黨的組織紀律和廉潔紀律，構成嚴重職務違法並涉嫌受賄犯罪，且在黨的十八大後不收斂、不收手，性質嚴重，影響惡劣，應予嚴肅處理。\n ↓立即下載星島頭條App↓\n↓立即下載星島頭條App↓",

    "title": "Crimen en el country de Pilar: la reveladora prueba que complica aún más a la empleada del ingeniero asesinado - MDZ Online",
    "text": "La mujer detenida por el crimen del ingeniero Roberto Wolfenson, ocurrido en el country La Delfina en febrero pasado, está cada vez más complicada. Ahora hallaron su ADN en la víctima. Rosalía Soledad Paniagua, la empleada doméstica acusada de matar al ingeniero Roberto Wolfenson en el country La Delfina de Pilar, ) quedó muy complicada en la causa tras conocerse que hallaron ADN suyo debajo de las uñas de la víctima. Los investigadores creen que este hombre \"arañó\" a la sospechosa mientras era ahorcado con un hilo, una tanza de pescar. Además, otra pericia sostiene que tres cabellos encontrados en la escena del crimen , ocurrido el 22 de febrero pasado, corresponden a ala sospechosa. El juez de Garantías Nicolás Ceballos había dictaminado a fines de abril la prisión preventiva para esta mujer, por robo calificado por el uso de arma impropia, en concurso real con homicidio criminis causa. Esto significa que presuntamente asesinó al empresario para ocultar el ilícito. “La aquí imputada, se apoderó ilegítimamente de un aparato celular, un parlante tipo bluetooth, un par de auriculares misma marca, un cuchillo de cocina, un candelabro de bronce macizo y un par de guantes de limpieza de color rojo, propiedad del nombrado Wolfenson”, redactó el fiscal Germán Camafreitas en su acusación. El documento agregó: “Asimismo, con el claro fin de procurar su impunidad, aprovechando su calidad de empleada doméstica, dentro de la habitación de huésped ubicada en la planta alta de la finca mencionada, mediante la utilización de un elemento en forma de lazo, y mediante golpes, Paniagua lo colocó alrededor del cuello del señor Roberto Eduardo Wolfenson Band y provocó su asfixia hasta su muerte, para luego darse a la fuga con los objetos de valor sustraídos”. El hecho Fue el 22 de febrero cuando el ingeniero apareció sin vida en su casa ubicada dentro del country La Delfina. En principio el certificado de defunción señalaba que había muerto de forma natural, pero las pericias corroboraron que lo habían matado. Un mes después, Paniagua declaró y dio una insólita versión de los hechos. Señaló que la víctima tenía un amante y que él había sido quien lo asesinó. El fiscal consideró: “Una cosa es mentir para ejercer su derecho de defensa legalmente amparado, y otra cosa es mentir para desviar el curso de la investigación, circunstancias puesta de relevo en todos los dichos de la aquí imputada, ya que fueron desvirtuados con prueba científica y testimonial a lo largo de la investigación”.
