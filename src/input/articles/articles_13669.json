    "text": "MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. (WSVN) – A couple was arrested after causing a scare outside a day care facility in South Florida.\nEstrella Maria Pereira, who was one of the accused, said the two didn’t realize there was a day care near where they were pulling a publicity stunt.\n“It was a poor decision,” she said.\nPereira and Miguel Ruiz were seen taking two rifles out of a Corvette before aiming it directly at the Devon Aire Kiddy College in Miami-Dade County.\nPereira now says they made a mistake.\n“Really, we’re not bad people, we will never harm anyone or anything,” she said. “We’re bodybuilders and we’re into the social media thing, Youtube Channel, you know, Instagram so forth, and he thought it would be cool to take a picture with a gun, because with muscles and guns, and it sounds really cool, like if you look at a photograph like that.”\nThe incident was supposed to be a photoshoot, according to Pereira, but it put the day care on lockdown and alarmed many parents.\n“We did everything in our power to protect the children that are here in the facility and we followed every measure to stay safe,” an unnamed day care said.\nPereira has since been bailed out, while Ruiz is still being held in custody.\nWhat began as a publicity stunt is now causing the two to be faced with serious charges.\n“It’s ridiculous,” Pereira said. “And yes, it is getting blown out of proportion. But I do understand the severity, and how it could scare somebody, because I would be freaked out if I saw somebody doing the same thing, I’d be freaked out.”\nRuiz and Pereira have been ordered to stay away from the woman who called police and the day care center.\nCopyright 2024 WSVN via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom delivered a common sense ruling on the transgender debate, unanimously stating that a woman is someone born biologically female.\nAs a physician, I deal in biology—not ideology.\nThe UK Supreme Court just ruled what every doctor knows: a woman is defined by biology.\nYou can’t change your biological sex. Gender isn’t something you self-define.\nThis isn’t bigotry. It’s reality.\n[pic.twitter.com/Hn9SIPgeUo]\n— Dr. Simone Gold (@drsimonegold)\n[April 16, 2025] Fox News reports:\nTrans women can be excluded from some single-sex spaces and groups under the U.K. Equality Act, the five judges of the top court ruled. These spaces and groups include changing rooms, homeless shelters, swimming areas and medical or counseling services provided only to women.\nThe ruling means that even a transgender person with a certificate that recognizes them as female should not be considered a woman for equality purposes.\nBut Justice Patrick Hodge said its ruling “does not remove protection from trans people,” who are “protected from discrimination on the ground of gender reassignment.”\n“Interpreting ‘sex’ as certificated sex would cut across the definitions of ‘man’ and ‘woman’ … and, thus, the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way,” Hodge said. “It would create heterogeneous groupings.”\nWomen’s rights groups celebrated the ruling outside the court.\n🚨New: The UK Supreme Court has ruled trans women are not legally biological women\nCongratulations\n[@jk_rowling] [pic.twitter.com/VF4hYfFwoA]\n— The Calvin Coolidge Project (@TheCalvinCooli1)\n[April 16, 2025]\nWATCH:\nUK Supreme Court just ruled that law defines women as people born biologically female.\nThis is a huge win for women, men, and sanity in the UK and the West.\nNow every country needs to get onboard and recognize in law what is a woman.\nCongratulations to UK women!\n[pic.twitter.com/nJU0zQvIgl]\n— Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl)\n[April 16, 2025]\nPer\nBBC:\nThe court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.\nJudge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.\nThe Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.\nThe Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.\nLord Hodge said the central question was how the words “woman” and “sex” are defined in the legislation.\nHe told the court: “The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.\n“But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.”\nHe added that the legislation gives transgender people “protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender”.",

    "title": "Hiker found alive after 10 days lost in California mountains reveals how he survived",
    "text": "A shirtless hiker who went missing for 10 days in remote northern California mountains has been found alive despite having no water and not telling anyone where he was going.\nLukas McClish, 34, had set out on a three-hour hike through the Big Basin Redwoods State Park in Boulder Creek, California, on June 11 after his friend mentioned a granite outcropping in the area.\nHe did not tell anyone where he was going, and had brought with him just a few supplies because he is an experienced hiker who has traversed other rugged regions of the US.\n‘I left with a pair of pants, and my hiking shoes and a hat,’ McClish told KGO-TV. ‘I had a flashlight and a air of folding scissors, like a Leatherman tool – and that was about it.’\nMcClish, an experienced hiker who does landscaping in forests razed by wildfires, said he was ‘astounded’ that he got lost – and so quickly. The alarm was only raised by his parents when he failed to turn up for lunch on father’s day.\nBefore he was rescued he spent nine nights and 10 days – shirtless – foraging for himself as he drank water from the creek, ate wild berries and slept on wet leaves, losing around 2.5st (30lbs) in weight.\nThings got worse on day eight when he came down with hypothermia and slipped while going over a rock face. So decided to shout: ‘Help, help, I’m over here’ for around 48 hours before several of the 300 rangers searching for him heard him.\nA drone was sent up and he was quickly found with the help of a sniffer dog. And remarkably he only needed one night in hospital before he could return home to his family, who had been waiting for him at the forest’s edge when he was rescued.\nLukas McClish, 34, was rescued from the Big Basin Redwoods State Park in Boulder Creek, California after 10 days\nThe moment that Mr McClish was reunited him with his family (pic\nMcClish said he initially considered the predicament a chance to test his survival skills\nThe area in which he was hiking had been razed in the CZU Lightning Complex fire of 2020 and ‘looks completely different from all of the other terrain,’ he explained.\n‘That’s one thing I didn’t take into consideration – when the fire comes through like that and decimates it, it turns into the desert and you’re unable to find your bearings.’\nThe typical markers to indicate direction, such as deer trails or hiking paths, were gone.\nBut at first, McClish considered his predicament a chance to test his survival skills, according to the New York Times.\n‘I’m an avid backpacker, so for me to go out for a night or two is not out of the norm,’ he told the Times.\nOn that first cold night, though, McClish tried to build himself a camp – but the brush he used to start a fire was wet.\nHe then hiked across a canyon for better shelter, and the next day set out to find a stream he thought would be nearby.\n‘So I just kind of hiked,’ McClish told WDBJ. ‘Each day I go up a canyon, down a canyon, to the next waterfall, drank water out of my boot.’\n‘I felt comfortable every time I was out there,’ he said. ‘I wasn’t worried about it.’\n‘I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool,’ McClish added. ‘It kept its distance.\n‘I think it was just somebody watching over me.’\nThe Big Basin Redwoods State Park was hit by a wildfire in August that burned roughly 97 percent of the parks 18,224 acres\nHis parents grew worried when he did not show up for Fathers’ Day and filed a missing persons report\nBut by day five, McClish started to grow concerned – and tried to find a way back to civilization.\n‘I knew if I kept following the sun, I’d get to the ocean eventually, but I didn’t know how far from the ocean I was,’ he said.\nMeanwhile, his family began to worry when he did not show up for Father’s Day, and filed a missing person’s report.\nThat sparked a massive manhunt, involving nearly 300 people and emergency personnel from several agencies.\n‘Some nights, although I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK – and that was hard to do some nights, when we would go to bed at night, because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping, how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,’ his mother, Diane McClish, told WDBJ.\nThe missing persons report sparked a massive, nearly 300-person manhunt for the missing hiker\nMcClish was finally found when park rangers heard his cries for help\nAs search efforts continued, McClish started shouting for help as he experienced hypothermia and slipped while going over a rock face.\n‘Help, help, I’m over here,’ he remembers screaming over and over during days eight and nine, along with ‘Is anybody out there?’\nAt the same time, McClish said he kept dreaming about his next meal as he was forced to survive on wild berries.\n‘I wanted a burrito or a taco bowl,’ he said. ‘That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.’\nFinally, at around 7.30pm on Thursday, two park rangers were making their way up a hill and heard McClish’s screams.\n‘I’m thinking, I hope this isn’t a mirage,’ McClish recounted.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted him, while a dog tracked him down\nBut the Boulder Creek Fire Department soon deployed a drone and spotted him, while a dog tracked him down.\nHe was then escorted out of the wilderness by police, and was reunited with his anxious family.\nMcClish would go on to spend Thursday night safely at a local hospital, where doctors removed rocks from his back.\nHe said he still doesn’t fear the wilderness, but admitted: ‘I did enough hiking for probably the whole rest of the year.’\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

    "title": "¿Adiós órganos autónomos? Reformas constitucionales de AMLO se votarán en septiembre",
    "text": "Foto: (Especial) En conferencia de prensa, Ignacio Mier, coordinador del grupo parlamentario de Morena en la Cámara de Diputados, anunció que las 18 reformas constitucionales propuestas por el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) en febrero de este año serán sometidas a votación en septiembre. El diputado indicó que las reformas se votarán mediante una nueva mayoría calificada, lo que implica que se necesitará el apoyo de al menos dos tercios de los legisladores presentes para su aprobación, de concretarse el triunfo de Morena en las pasadas elecciones (372 diputados de 500 y 83 de 128 senadores), esto ya no sería una preocupación para el partido oficial al menos en la cámara baja, pero en el Senado todavía tendrían que convencer a algunos legisladores de oposición. En ese sentido, se mencionó que la Comisión de Puntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados ya se encuentra trabajando en los dictámenes correspondientes para cada una de las reformas. Entre las reformas que se destacan en este paquete de 18 propuestas, se encuentran la Reforma Judicial, la Reforma Militar, la Reforma Electoral y la desaparición de órganos autónomos como el Instituto Nacional de Transparencia, Acceso a la Información y Protección de Datos Personales (INAI). ¿Cuáles son las reformas de AMLO? La Reforma Judicial tiene como objetivo principal modificar la estructura y funcionamiento del Poder Judicial, con miras a hacerlo más eficiente y accesible para los ciudadanos, además de que los ministros de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación sean elegidos por voto popular. En el caso de la Reforma Militar se pretende redefinir el papel de las Fuerzas Armadas en la seguridad pública, ampliando su participación en tareas de seguridad ciudadana y pasar de lleno el mando de la Guardia Nacional a la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Sedena). Por otro lado, la Reforma Electoral incluye modificaciones en la organización y funcionamiento del Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) como que los consejeros sean elegidos también por voto popular y contempla la disminución de plurinominales. Finalmente, una de las reformas más controvertidas es la desaparición de órganos autónomos. Esta medida ha sido criticada por diversos sectores, quienes argumentan que podría representar un retroceso en materia de transparencia y acceso a la información si se llega a desaparecer el INAI. Paquete original de reformas Reconocimiento de los pueblos indígenas y afromexicanos. Garantizar la pensión para adultos mayores y el aumento de ésta cada año; así como la atención para personas con discapacidad. Otorgar becas a estudiantes de bajos recursos en todos los niveles escolares. Garantizar atención médica integral y gratuita a la población. Garantizar la vivienda de los trabajadores. Prohibir el maltrato de animales. Prohibición del fracking y no otorgar concesiones para la actividad minera a cielo abierto. Respetar las zonas con escasez de agua y sólo otorgar concesiones para uso doméstico. Prohibir el comercio de vapeadores y drogas químicas como el fentanilo. Aumentar el salario mínimo por encima de la inflación anual. Que el salario mínimo de maestros, policías, marinos, enfermeras, médicos, entre otros trabajadores de gobierno, no sea menor al de trabajadores inscritos al seguro social. Revertir las reformas a las pensiones aprobadas en 1997 y 2007 por los presidentes Ernesto Zedillo y Felipe Calderón. Garantizar el derecho a la educación y al trabajo. Brindar seguro a campesinos que cultivan sus tierras y mantener programas de apoyo directo a la producción. Utilizar 18,000 kilómetros de vías férreas para trenes de pasajeros y devolver a la Comisión Federal de Electricidad su carácter de empresa pública estratégica. Reducción de gastos electorales, disminución a 64 senadores y 300 diputados, y reducir a 30% de participación para que las consultas populares sean vinculantes. Elección de jueces, magistrados y ministros por voto popular. Integrar la Guardia Nacional a la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional para evitar corrupción. Establecer en la Constitución que ningún servidor público puede ganar más que el presidente de la República. Eliminar los órganos autónomos.",

    "text": "Donald Trump insists his cameo made 'Home Alone 2' a success: 'I was, and still am, great' [Patrick Ryan](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/2646682001/patrick-ryan/) Donald Trump wants you to know that he’s no Grinch. Sure, [he once told a 7-year-old boy](/story/news/politics/2018/12/24/donald-trump-tells-child-its-marginal-still-believe-santa-clause/2410738002/) that believing in Santa is “marginal.” But the former president insists he was nothing but gracious on the set of [“Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,”](/story/entertainment/movies/2023/12/22/home-alone-movies-ranked/72012545007/) after the film’s director claimed that Trump forced his way into a cameo. On Wednesday, Trump addressed his blink-and-you'll-miss-it role in the 1992 comedy [in a lengthy post on Truth Social](https://twitter.com/DrewSav/status/1740121012455272756), his social-media platform. “Director Chris Columbus, and others, were begging me to make a cameo appearance in ‘Home Alone 2,’ ” Trump wrote. “They rented the Plaza Hotel in New York, which I owned at the time. I was very busy, and didn’t want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent. I agreed, and the rest is history! “That little cameo took off like a rocket and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmastime,” he added. “People call me whenever it is aired.” Columbus recently told [Business Insider](https://www.insider.com/home-alone-30-anniversary-chris-columbus-trump-cameo-2020-11) that in addition to a standard shooting fee, Trump would only let them use the Plaza if he could make a cameo. “He did bully his way into the movie,” Columbus said. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” Trump wrote. “That cameo helped make the movie a success, but if they felt bullied, or didn’t want me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years? Because I was, and still am, great for the movie, that’s why! Just another Hollywood guy from the past looking for a quick fix of Trump publicity for himself!” “Home Alone 2” made a whopping $359 million [at the worldwide box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0104431/). It’s impossible to ever truly know how much of that was fueled by Trump’s six-second, one-line cameo.
