    "text": "Lind-Ritzville seniors ready to face the world\nRITZVILLE — The Lind-Ritzville Class of 2025 has made it.\n“Today, we're walking across the stage in wizard hats, holding diplomas that prove we endured through it all: the chaos, the cramming and the laughter and all the growing pains that came with high school,” said salutatorian Temple Gefre.\nTwo by two, the 34 members of the Class of 2025 processed into the Gilson Gym on Saturday to the high school band’s strains of “Pomp and Circumstance.” As is LRHS custom, the procession was led by the junior class marshals, Zoe Galbreath and Beau Fode.\nLRHS Principal Kevin Terris started by reading a list of accomplishments of members of the class of 2025. Some, like participating in Future Farmers of America or performing in the school band, were fairly general.\nOthers were very specific.\n“If you finished in seventh place at the WIAA state track competition 200-meter run with a time of 22.79, please stand,” Terris said.\nThe class had nine valedictorians, of whom five spoke at the ceremony. Camden Shaver took the podium first.\n“I wasn't going to do a speech here today until one of my closest friends said to me, ‘I've never seen a brown person on that stage in a long time,’” she said. “And as silly and bold as that sounds, it truly hit … Whether your skin is brown, yellow or purple, whether your hair doesn't ‘behave,’ your background is different, or your identity or expression doesn't match what people expect, you are not too much. You are more than enough.”\nEmilia Klewin attended classes at Eastern Washington University and participated in ROTC there while finishing up at LRHS, an experience that brought some lessons home to her. Brody Boness’ high school years were marked with adversity through major sports injuries, he said, which taught him the value of perseverance. Alyssa Williams discussed overcoming her competitive nature to learn that comparison is the killer of joy, and Addy Colbert spoke of learning not to be so eager for the next stage of life that you miss out on the current one.\nThe Class of 2025, collectively, was awarded more than $1 million in scholarships, School Counselor Kayla Walker said. Additionally, a few students were singled out for special recognition. Fredy Granados-Lopez and Liz Cruz earned the Washington State Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish. Granados-Lopez also received The Harry P. Hayes Award. The Honor Cup went to Claire Wellsandt.\nThe guest speaker was former Gonzaga basketball star Mike Nilson, who spoke about the importance of commitment. Final words before the diplomas were awarded came from senior Brix Curtis, chosen by his peers to deliver the closing address. Curtis was not an especially distinguished student or an impressive athlete, he said, but his class’s achievements weren’t about those things.\n“The best part about my class is that at their core, they're all good, kind people and to me, that is what matters,” he said. “As far back as I can remember, my class has always been in constant competition, not to be better than each other, but to better ourselves as a collective. We have nine valedictorians for a reason … We all did these things not to impress ourselves, but because we were all surrounded by impressive people, people who lift each other up and show each other it’s possible to do great things once again.”",

About 7% of Americans have oral HPV, while [genital HPV](//www.webmd.com/oral-health/oral-hpv-cancer) is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the U.S. The immune system fights the virus and most people don’t show symptoms.

Cancers usually develop in the throat, at the back of the roof of the mouth, or at the base of the tongue, according to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/oral-hpv-cancer). You can be infected for 10 years or more before a cancer develops. Men are three times more likely to get cancer from HPV than women. The cancers are most common in people under age 60, especially those in their 30s and 40s.",

    "text": "Indiana women get new start on college from behind bars\nWednesday, June 4, 2025\nBy Claire Rafford for Mirror Indy.\nBroadcast version by Terri Dee for Indiana News Service reporting for the Mirror Indy-Free Press Indiana-Public News Service Collaboration.\nFor Kaneka Kidd, college has very much been a family affair.\nShe started classes through Marian University’s program at the Indiana Women’s Prison at the same time her youngest daughter started college.\nKidd also called her grandkids often to tell them about the classes she was taking, to hopefully encourage them to attend college one day. It was important to her that her family knew she was learning while inside.\n“Being incarcerated for so long, you have to have something to go home to,” Kidd, 46, said. “I wanted to be an encouragement to them, also.”\nKidd was one of six women to graduate May 16 with her associate of arts degree from Marian University. Through its Women’s College Partnership, Marian offers classes and degrees to women at the prison, including those who committed violent crimes.\nMarian’s been offering classes at the women’s prison since 2019 in collaboration with the Bard Prison Initiative, a national organization that supports liberal arts programs for incarcerated students. Students take classes in a variety of subjects, including civics, art, literature and science.\nIf Courtney Kincaid had to pick a favorite class from her two-and-a-half years of Marian education, it would be the “inside-out” class this spring, where students from Marian’s main campus came to the prison to take the class alongside the incarcerated students.\nIn that class, there was no divide. Everyone learned together, and that meant the world to Kincaid.\n“It pushed me to continue to empower other people that this degree is a statement for us to be able to be students,” Kincaid, 35, said. “Because in this program, that’s what we are. We’re students. We’re not seen for where we wake up every day.”\nKincaid has always wanted to go to college, but she said life got in the way. Though she studied at Huntington University in northern Indiana and Purdue Fort Wayne, the May 16 ceremony was her first-ever graduation. She was chosen by her classmates to be the commencement speaker.\nAfter working toward that goal for so long, walking across the stage was surreal.\n“I almost couldn’t believe it,” Kincaid said. “It was like an out-of-body experience, because I accomplished something I always wanted to do, and I didn’t think that I would have the opportunity in a location like this.”\nKincaid’s celebrating her degree, but her educational journey isn’t over. She’s already studying to earn her bachelor’s degree from Marian, and eventually hopes to get a master’s degree and become a social worker.\nKidd has similar ambitions. She knows firsthand how hard it is for women experiencing domestic violence to escape abusive relationships, and hopes to use her lived experience to help people like her through social work.\n“I want to help someone, because I wasn’t able to get the help,” she said.\nClaire Rafford wrote this article for Mirror Indy.\nget more stories like this via email\nEnvironment\nAs the cleanup effort continues at Hobbs State Park Conservation Area in Rogers, officials with Arkansas State Parks have authorized a temporary …\nSocial Issues\nJune is Pride Month, and Washington's Lavender Rights Project is celebrating with a Black Trans Comedy Showcase.
