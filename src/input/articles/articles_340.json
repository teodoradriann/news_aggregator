Come spesso ha sottolineato Paola Iezzi è il simbolo della nuova Italia che avanza, quella dell’integrazione e dell’inclusione. Era anche l’unica donna arrivata in Finale . Entrata nella squadra di Manuel Agnelli , Mimì ha conquistato giudici e pubblico grazie alla voce unica e ha consentito al suo coach di vincere per la prima volta in sei edizioni in cui ha partecipato.\nLa musica per Mimì “è uno strumento per comunicare emozioni e fuggire dalle responsabilità di un mondo noioso” .\nE non solo: “La musica è il mezzo più potente per abbattere barriere e condividere emozioni autentiche”.\nFin dall’inizio del talent, Mimì Caruso ha conquistato tutti e quattro i giudici con il suo stile, guadagnandosi un posto tra i 12 concorrenti ufficiali di stagione e poi tra i finalisti. Alle Audizioni, Mimì ha presentato una cover di “Figures” di Jessie Reyez. La sua interpretazione intensa ed emozionante ha spinto Manuel Agnelli a utilizzare il suo X Pass, garantendole l’accesso diretto ai Bootcamp. Ai Bootcamp e agli Home vist ha confermato il suo posto nel talent show.\n“Dove si va” è l’inedito di Mimì, scritto da Madame e prodotto da Gianmarco Manilardi.\nCLICCA IL MINUTO PER MINUTO DELLA DIRETTA DA NAPOLI\nCon il suo Best Of Mimì ci ha fatto sorridere, emozionare e sognare #XF2024 pic.twitter.com/AMVTeH21tt\n— X FACTOR (@XFactor_Italia) December 5, 2024\nNapoli X-Factor Condividi questo articolo",

(CBS 58) -- This New Year, make your well-being a priority -- that's the message Eric Toney wants people know.\nIn July, the Fond du Lac district attorney began experiencing health issues.\n“Fever, chills, sweats, and then night sweats was what really put it over the edge where that’s just not normal,\" said Toney.\nFrom there, his symptoms took a turn for the worse.\n“I actually fell in the office where I had lost control of one of my legs for maybe 20 seconds and it cleared up,\" said Toney.\nThe problem was his heart.\n\"He was a young man who developed an infection in his aortic valve,\" said Dr. Thomas Hinkamp, a cardiothoracic surgeon with SSM Health St. Agnes Hospital.\nEach heartbeat was more difficult than the one before.\n“His heart was able to pump out blood, but the blood that he did pump out unfortunately, would drop right back into the heart,\" said Hinkamp. \"His heart really wasn’t going to tolerate it for a long period of time.”\nOne visit turned into another and before he knew it, Toney was in the operating room.\n“You’re going to need open heart surgery, so that was quite a whirlwind for me, I certainly wasn’t expecting it,\" said Toney.\nToney says while his situation may be rare, his message to others isn't.\n“We can take our health for granted and that’s why it's so important to just make sure that when you’re seeing those symptoms, just check in with your doctor,\" said Toney.\nToney says he plans on starting the new year by running a 5k with his now-healthy heart.",

    "text": "The Peruvian parataekwondo player wins her second consecutive Paralympic title, writing a new page in the history of the national sport. Angelica Espinoza He made history by becoming a two-time champion Paralympics at the Paris 2024 Games . The national parataekwondo player, who had already won the gold medal at Tokyo 2020, reaffirmed her dominance in the sport by once again achieving glory in the K44 (-47kg) category.\nAugust 29, 2024 will be an unforgettable date for Angélica and for Peruvian sports. Her victory not only gave her a new gold medal, but also placed her on the same level as legendary paraswimmer Jimmy Eulert, who had achieved the same feat at the Atlanta and Sydney 2000 Games in 1996.\nOn her way to the final, Espinoza showed an undeniable superiority. In her first match, she defeated Cameroonian Guileine Chemogne with a resounding score of 28-9, which took her to the quarterfinals. There, she authoritatively defeated Iranian Maryam Abdollahpour 19-9, securing a place in the semifinals.\nRead also:\nPeruvian Para-athletes set out for Paris 2024 in pursuit of Paralympic medals\nThe semifinal was not played because her opponent, Naoual Laarif of Morocco, was unable to appear due to injury. This allowed Angelica to advance directly to the final, where she faced Ziyodakhon Isakova of Uzbekistan. In an exceptional performance, Espinoza won 10-4, thus obtaining her second gold medal at the Paralympics.\nAngélica, who began her career in parataekwondo in 2017 and won her first gold medal at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, has shown that there are no limits for those who pursue their dreams with determination and passion.\nIn addition to Espinoza’s feat, other Peruvian paraathletes also achieved outstanding performances at Paris 2024. Paraswimmer Rodrigo Santillán earned a Paralympic diploma by finishing sixth in the S2 100-meter backstroke final. For their part, Daniella Campos, in paraarch, and Rubí Fernández, in parabadminton, also competed, but were unable to advance to the next rounds.\n#Angélica #Espinoza #Twotime #Paralympic #Champion #Paris\n2024-09-05 15:59:05",

Para mi el primer gol de ellos fue off side, el penal que le hacen al Colo (por Juan Barinaga) fue penal... Después en la cancha el penal a Franco (Jara) no me pareció, pero la vi recién y pareció que lo toca justo... Lo que por ahí molesta es que ni revisen y que pasa rápido la jugada”, se quejó el capitán celeste. Longo siguió analizando la jugada del primer tanto de Lanús. “Le dije (al árbitro) que le sale de atrás a Nacho (Chicco), la pelota le va a él y salta... Para mi, participa de la jugada. Te dicen que lo chequean... Me da bronca que si dentro de la cancha cobran, después te dicen que no es claro, por qué cambia”, insistió el volante. “Ahora hay que cambiar el chip rápido. El lunes tenemos un partido complicadísimo en Alberdi (contra Godoy Cruz), ojalá que podamos volver a ganar de local, que nos estamos haciendo fuerte y eso es importante”, completó Longo en diálogo con 351 Deportes.",
