    "text": "Are SPS Corals Hard to Keep? A Reef Keeper’s Candid Guide The short answer? Yes, generally, SPS (Small Polyp Stony) corals are considered challenging to keep in a reef aquarium. However, like any endeavor in the reefing world, it’s a matter of perspective, preparation, and perseverance. While some species are notoriously finicky, others are more forgiving. Success with SPS hinges on understanding their specific needs and maintaining a stable, pristine environment. This guide will delve into the nuances of keeping these captivating corals, equipping you with the knowledge to decide if they’re right for your reefing journey.\nUnderstanding the SPS Challenge SPS corals, the architects of breathtaking coral reefs, are undeniably beautiful. Their vibrant colors and intricate branching structures add unmatched beauty to any tank. But this beauty comes at a price: the price of dedication and meticulous attention to detail.\nThe primary reason SPS corals are challenging stems from their sensitivity to water parameters . They demand near-perfect conditions to thrive, far more so than soft corals or even many LPS (Large Polyp Stony) corals. Fluctuations in alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, temperature, and salinity can quickly lead to stress, bleaching, and even death.\nFurthermore, SPS corals are very particular about lighting and water flow . They need intense, full-spectrum light to fuel their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae. Strong, turbulent water flow is essential for delivering nutrients, removing waste, and preventing detritus buildup.\nAggression from neighboring corals is another concern. Many LPS corals possess potent stinging capabilities, and SPS corals are often vulnerable to these attacks. Careful placement and consideration of each coral’s “personality” are essential for a harmonious reef environment.\nFactors Influencing SPS Success Several factors contribute to the success (or failure) of keeping SPS corals:\nWater Quality: This is paramount. Maintaining stable alkalinity (around 8-11 dKH), calcium (400-450 ppm), magnesium (1250-1350 ppm), and near-zero nitrates and phosphates is crucial. Regular testing and appropriate supplementation are non-negotiable. Lighting: SPS corals need intense light, typically provided by metal halides, T5 fluorescent bulbs, or high-quality LEDs. The specific type and intensity will depend on the species of SPS you’re keeping. Water Flow: Strong, turbulent flow is essential for nutrient delivery and waste removal. Powerheads and wavemakers are your allies here. Stability: Consistency is key. Minimize fluctuations in water parameters, temperature, and salinity. Equipment: A reliable protein skimmer, refugium, or other nutrient control methods are essential. A quality controller to monitor and automate parameters is also highly recommended. Acclimation: Properly acclimating new SPS corals to your tank is vital. Drip acclimation is generally the preferred method. Observation: Regularly observing your corals for signs of stress (e.g., loss of color, tissue recession) is crucial for early intervention. Patience: A successful reef tank is not built overnight. It takes time for the ecosystem to mature and stabilize. Beginner-Friendly SPS Corals While many SPS corals are best left to experienced reef keepers, some are more tolerant and suitable for beginners who are committed to maintaining optimal conditions:\nMontipora: Certain species of Montipora, such as Montipora digitata and Montipora capricornis, are relatively hardy and fast-growing. Seriatopora: Birdsnest corals (Seriatopora hystrix) are another good option for beginners. Stylophora: Similar to Seriatopora, Stylophora corals are relatively easy to care for. Pocillopora: This coral is considered an excellent choice for beginners. These corals are more forgiving of minor fluctuations in water parameters and can provide a good introduction to SPS keeping. However, even these “easy” SPS corals require diligent care and attention.\nAdvanced SPS Corals Acropora, beautiful corals that come in nearly any color imaginable, are the most demanding species, including Acropora millepora and Acropora tenuis. They are extremely sensitive to changes in water parameters. They require very stable conditions and are best left to experienced reef keepers.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some frequently asked questions to further illuminate the world of SPS corals:\n1. What exactly does “SPS” stand for? SPS stands for Small Polyp Stony . The “S” can also stand for Scleractinian. These corals are characterized by their small polyps and stony, calcium carbonate skeletons.\n2. How often should I test my water parameters? Ideally, you should test your water parameters at least once a week . More frequent testing (e.g., every other day) is recommended when initially setting up your tank or after making any significant changes.\n3. What type of lighting is best for SPS corals? There’s no single “best” type of lighting. Metal halides, T5 fluorescent bulbs, and high-quality LEDs can all be used successfully. The key is to provide sufficient intensity and a full spectrum of light. LED fixtures are becoming increasingly popular due to their energy efficiency, controllability, and longevity.\n4. How important is water flow for SPS corals? Water flow is crucial . It delivers nutrients, removes waste, prevents detritus buildup, and helps maintain oxygen levels. Aim for turbulent, random flow throughout your tank.\n5. What are some common signs of stress in SPS corals? Common signs of stress include loss of color (bleaching), tissue recession, and a dull, lifeless appearance.\n6. What causes SPS corals to turn brown? SPS corals can turn brown due to elevated phosphate and/or nitrates in the water and/or insufficient lighting . These factors increase the density of zooxanthellae, resulting in a brownish hue.\n7. Do SPS corals need to be fed? Yes, SPS corals benefit from feeding. They can absorb nutrients directly from the water, but supplemental feeding with small particle foods can enhance their growth and coloration.\n8. What’s the best food for SPS corals? Small particle foods such as Oyster-Feast™ and R.O.E. Real Oceanic Eggs™ are excellent choices. You can also use powdered coral foods or phytoplankton.\n9. Can I mix LPS and SPS corals in the same tank? Yes, but with careful planning . LPS corals typically require lower lighting and water flow than SPS corals, so you may need to create separate zones in your tank to accommodate both types of corals. Some LPS corals are also aggressive and can sting SPS corals, so be mindful of placement.\n10. Are SPS corals aggressive? SPS corals are generally less aggressive compared to many LPS corals. However, some species can still sting or shade their neighbors.\n11. How do I acclimate new SPS corals to my tank? Drip acclimation is the preferred method. Slowly drip water from your tank into the bag containing the coral over a period of several hours. This allows the coral to gradually adjust to your tank’s water parameters.\n12. What’s the ideal salinity for an SPS reef tank? The ideal salinity is around 1.025-1.026 specific gravity (35 ppt) .\n13. Should I add fish or corals first to a new tank? It’s generally recommended to cycle your tank with fish first , then wait several weeks (or even months) before adding corals, especially sensitive SPS corals. This allows the biological filter to mature and stabilize.\n14. How long should I wait before adding SPS corals to a new tank? You often hear that you should wait 4 to 6 months and sometimes up to a year before adding sensitive SPS corals to a tank.\n15. Where should SPS corals be placed in a tank? SPS corals must go at the top and LPS corals in the middle range and bottom.\nThe Final Verdict Keeping SPS corals is undoubtedly a challenge, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. With diligent research, proper equipment, and unwavering commitment to maintaining pristine water quality, you can create a thriving SPS reef tank that will be the envy of every reef keeper.\nRemember to educate yourself further on the complexities of reef ecosystems, with resources like The Environmental Literacy Council at enviroliteracy.org , which helps promote understanding of environmental issues. Embrace the challenge, and you’ll be rewarded with the unparalleled beauty of SPS corals.",

    "title": "Ian Proud – Pranked Sikorski says quiet part out loud about Kyiv’s​ EU challenge",
    "text": "When it comes to Ukraine joining, Poland may not exactly prove to be Ukraine’s best friend\nIan Proud was a member of HM Diplomatic Service from 1999 to 2023. From July 2014 to 2019 he was posted to the British Embassy in Moscow, where he led on politico-economic analysis and sanctions policy. He has recently published his memoir A Misfit in Moscow: How British Diplomacy in Russia failed, 2014-2019 Cross-posted from Responsible Statecraft\nTrenchant Polish Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, was rendered red faced recently by a prankster , who interviewed him, pretending to be former Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko.\nSikorski illuminated a number of granular and controversial policy issues related to the Ukraine war. His most telling comments focussed on Ukraine’s aspiration to join the European Union, which he described as a process ‘that will take a decade or more’.\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, Zelensky has been pushing for immediate or fast- tracked EU membership for Ukraine. Ukraine has campaigned hard for this, the EU finally opening accession negotiations in June 2024. Sikorski’s comments remind us what others have voiced quietly: that it won’t be quick and easy.\nMore significantly, he hints at reasons why it might not be possible at all, on terms that Ukraine would like.\nDespite being British, I’m a passionate believer in the European project and I think it is right for Ukraine to focus on future membership. Unlike many, I have always seen the EU as first and foremost an economic project. When I ended my posting to Russia in February 2019, I drove from Moscow to England, passing through Ukraine and into the EU at the Polish border. I saw the moderating influence on relationships between citizens of very different states, by opening borders to free movement and commerce.\nThe EU advertising slogan describes the enlargement process as a “geostrategic investment in peace, security, stability and prosperity.” But it’s not simply a matter of peace and security. It’s also a matter of money. The EU works on the basis of richer countries subsidising the poorer, in a carefully negotiated and hotly contested settlement that has been in place for twenty years since the last big bang enlargement. Ten wealthier countries, led by Germany, pay more to the EU than they receive, and subsidize the 17 less wealthy countries who receive more EU funds than they pay to the EU budget. An easy concept to grasp .\nSo, even though Poland has burgeoned economically since the end of the Cold War, it still receives more EU funding that it pays in. In fact, Poland receives more EU funds than any other European country, because it has such a large population, with net inflows of 7 billion euros in 2023 .\nBut Ukraine’s economy is four and a half times smaller than Poland’s. It is the poorest country in Europe — in fact, poorer now than Moldova — with the sixth largest population. It has a larger population than all the other EU aspirant countries combined. It would be, by some considerable margin, the largest recipient of EU funds in the event of accession.\nTake agriculture, where subsidies are carefully protected by existing EU member states precisely because of the domestic political blowback from farmers to any proposed change in funding and, therefore, livelihoods. Consider the protests by Polish farmers to the flood of cheap Ukrainian grain. Another insight during the prank call was Sikorski’s visible irritation at Zelensky’s proposed meeting with Polish farmers on the border in February, which the pole described as astunt.”\nShould it join the EU on the same terms as everyone else, Ukraine would account for a quarter of all farmland in Europe and be eligible for 96.8 billion euros or around a quarter of the total Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) seven-year funding envelope of 378.5 billion euros. That would mean cuts of 20% to farmers in other EU countries, and widespread resistance from agricultural lobby groups.\nI remember bitter protests by French farmers about British produce after the UK joined the European Economic Community, as it was called back then. Little surprise then, that President Macron of France said shortly after war started that EU membership for Ukraine will take decades. France would lose its place as the largest recipient of CAP funds if Ukraine joined.\nThere’s a wider problem. All of the new countries that want to join the EU are poorer countries. The EU budget wouldn’t survive contact with enlargement with the funding arrangements as they are now. Some countries that are net recipients of funds from the EU now, would end up putting in more than they received.\nPoland, which receives generous subsidies now, would likely become a net contributor . Add to that, probably, Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg. Poland will literally be paying for Ukraine to join the EU. So, in addition to Polish farmers protesting lower incomes and greater competition because of Ukraine, Polish people may also pay higher taxes.\nThat’s why there is much discussion in Europe about variable geometry , the idea that new countries can join Europe and integrate at a different, i.e. slower pace than existing members like Poland and France. This is simply code for kicking into the long grass the huge and disruptive reform to EU budgets that would be needed to give Ukraine the same benefits as long-standing members.\nIn August 2023, the Financial Times wrote a helpful piece that explains in simple terms the massive changes that Ukrainian membership would require internally within the EU. Ukraine has a much longer checklist of issues that it needs to address before it could join the EU, including vital work on justice reform and a more focussed effort to tackle corruption. It has already received upwards 118 billion euros in aid from the European Union. Ukrainian national debt has doubled since the war started and will pass 100% of GDP in 2025.\nSo, while I believe the wider political and economic benefits to Ukraine of EU membership are worth it, the road ahead will be fraught. Ukraine can’t progress with real purpose along that road while it chooses to prosecute a war against Russia that it will not be able to win decisively. And the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, at some distant point more than a decade in the future, may not, in fact, exist.\nLet’s be clear, Poland has been one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine, in particular in housing more refugees than any other EU country, except for Germany. Yet Sikorski remarked somberly that Ukraine’s farms “are too good.” In truth, Poland has no more interest than France or other major recipients of subsidies to see Ukraine join the EU on the same terms as them.\nIn the pork barrel of EU budgetary politics, Poland might not be Ukraine’s best friend.\nDue to the Israeli war crimes in Gaza we have increased our coverage from five to six days a week.

Эксперт Леонид Бутаков — о кейсах, выгодах и реальных бизнес-результатахЛеонид БутаковКоммерческий директор «Эквио». Эксперт рынка EdTech/HRtech, ex. Руководитель продаж GettПодробнее про эксперта\nПрофессионал с 12+ лет в продажах и 7+ в стратегическом управлении коммерцией (B2B). Успешный опыт реализации проектов по улучшению бизнес-процессов и повышению эффективности команд.\nКорпоративное образование выходит на новый уровень: микрообучение вместе с искусственным интеллектом превращает обучение в точечный, максимально релевантный и быстрый процесс. О том, как технология микрообучения меняет корпоративные платформы, и почему именно этот подход становится ключевым драйвером эффективности — в разговоре с Леонидом Бутаковым, коммерческим директором компании Эквио.\n— Леонид, сейчас звучит много слов вокруг обучения сотрудников. Почему именно микроформат?\n— Все просто: классические курсы — это иногда большие блоки информации, которые сложно внедрять и контролировать. А яркий пример микрообучения — это короткий модуль или мини-курс, который работник может пройти за 5–10 минут, прямо в рабочем потоке, когда возникает потребность. Это уже не опция, а инструмент оперативного повышения компетенций.\n— То есть слово за практикой. Есть уже примеры успешного запуска таких решений?\n— Безусловно. В одном из наших проектов, компанией «НефтьМагистраль», платформа Эквио стала местом, куда сотрудники заходят первым делом после начала рабочего дня, вместо привычных соцсетей.\nРегулярная публикация новостей, опросов, игровых активностей и мини-уроков помогла компании поставить рекорд — миллион нетопливных продаж. Руководители ежедневно делились информацией о выполнении плана, что пробудило соревновательный дух, повысило вовлеченность сотрудников и улучшило результаты работы.\nСначала мы предоставили контент, затем встроили элементы мотивации, чтобы закрепить знания на практике. Это классический пример эффективности микрообучения.\n— Как ИИ помогает делать это еще точнее и масштабнее?\n— С ИИ микрообучение в образовании — это уже не просто шаблон. Например, на платформе можно настроить автоматическую рассылку коротких образовательных ссылок или карточек по теме, когда система сама распознает — сотруднику нужно именно это.\nСкажем, после вводного обучения по CRM система оперативно предлагает мини-кейс о новой функции. Это персонализировано и не выбивается из рабочего потока.\n— Каковы преимущества микрообучения в таких форматах?\n— Главные плюсы — моментальность, актуальность, высокая вовлеченность и гибкость. Короткие модули сотрудники проходят прямо в рабочем потоке, не отвлекаясь от текущих процессов. Сотрудники чаще возвращаются к материалам, быстрее усваивают навыки и могут тут же применить их на практике.\nЭффект очевиден — знания становятся инструментом для решения реальных рабочих задач.\n— Что бы вы посоветовали бизнесу, который готов запускать такие решения?\n— Важно сразу ставить цели: что конкретно должно измениться после серии микроуроков? Если вы внедряете платформу — нужно измерять, как выросла вовлеченность, сколько задач решено, как изменились бизнес-показатели.\nИИ уже не просто футуризм, а инструмент повышения результативности ваших сотрудников. Метод микрообучения уже доказал свою эффективность, когда каждый модуль работает на скорость, актуальность и измеримый результат.\nИнтересное:\nНовости отрасли:\nВсе новости:\nПубликация компании\nДостижения\nКонтакты\nСоциальные сети",

    "text": "No urine sample among reasons why Palm Coast teen still jailed in cryptocurrency case Lack of a job, lack of a fixed address, lack of a urine specimen but no lack of aliases were among the reasons cited for keeping Noah Urban locked up, records show. [Frank Fernandez](/staff/5517230002/frank-fernandez/) A federal judge cited the uses of aliases as one of the reasons for keeping locked up pending trial a Palm Coast teenager, who sometimes went by “King Bob” and is accused of wire fraud in a [cryptocurrency theft scheme](/story/news/courts/2024/01/12/palm-coast-teen-who-went-by-king-bob-arrested-in-alleged-crypto-scheme/72201985007/). Noah Michael Urban, 19, was indicted on eight counts of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and five counts of aggravated identity theft. He has pleaded not guilty. Urban was part of a scheme that resulted in the theft of at least $800,000 from at least five different victims between August 2022 and March 2023, according to the indictment. Besides \"King Bob,\" Urban also used the aliases “Sosa,” “Elijah” and “Anthony Ramirez.” Urban was arrested Jan. 9 and his trial is scheduled to begin in the trial term starting March 4 in Jacksonville. A [detention hearing](/story/news/courts/2024/01/19/noah-urban-palm-coast-teen-accused-in-crypto-case-to-remain-detained/72285943007/) took place Jan. 19 in Jacksonville when a judge ordered Urban held pending his trial. According to an order, Federal Magistrate Judge Joel B. Toomey cited the following reasons for keeping Urban locked up pending his trial: - Urban had no fixed address and was using an alias to stay at an Airbnb. - When a search warrant was executed at Urban’s residence, he was downloading programs to delete computer files. - Urban told pretrial services that he could not remember if he traveled outside the United States. At least some of his accused co-conspirators are in foreign countries. - Despite telling authorities in May that he would not have any more contact with his co-conspirators and would not engage in cryptocurrency transactions he did so anyway. - Urban declined to answer detailed questions about his financial situation. - While he has never been employed, Urban appears self-supporting. - Urban was unable to provide a urine sample. - The weight of the evidence against him was strong. - If convicted he was subject to a long incarceration. - A preponderance of the evidence indicates no conditions on his release will reasonably assure his appearance. The cryptocurrency conspiracy Urban and other conspirators unlawfully obtained victims' personal identifying information and used it to [fraudulently access their virtual currency addresses](/story/news/local/flagler/2024/01/11/palm-coast-teen-indicted-in-theft-of-8 -in-cryptocurrency/72193001007/), according to the indictment. Using a SIM swap, the conspirators reset the victims' passwords and verified ownership of the victims’ cellphone numbers by one-time passwords. A SIM swap is a type of fraud in which conspirators take over a person’s cellphone account so that the victim’s incoming messages and texts are sent to a different phone. Once the SIM is swapped, the person can access the victim’s accounts, including those that use two-factor authentication. Once they accessed the victims' phones, Urban and other conspirators unlawfully transferred the victims’ cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the defendants, according to the indictment.",

    "text": "A Flair Airlines captain escaped injury after the windshield of his aircraft was shattered by a birdstrike.The incident occurred on October 24 on Flight F8641 from Toronto to Winnipeg, operated by a Boeing 737 Max.Shortly after takeoff, the pilots issued the urgency signal PAN-PAN, according to an air traffic control recording from LiveATC.net.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said in a report that the plane encountered a flock of geese and at least one of them hit the windshield, \\\"causing it to shatter.\\\"According to the ATC recording, one pilot said: \\\"The windshields are shattered and we cannot see outside.\\\" He added that they would need to stop on the runway after returning to Pearson and would probably be unable to taxi further.The TSB report added that a pilot had minor injuries due to the shattered glass, although the airline said the pilots were not hurt.Captain Matt Kunz, Flair's vice president of flight operations, told Business Insider: \\\"The bird struck the top of the captain's side windshield, causing damage and resulting in some glass pieces in the flight deck, but there were no injuries.\\\"He added that the flight operations team ensured the crew was safe and offered the option of taking leave.\\\"The pilot was not injured and, in fact, was back flying the next day,\\\" Kunz said.On Friday, data from FlightAware showed the affected plane, registered as C-FLKO, flew to Pinal Airpark — a storage, maintenance, and repair facility in Arizona.Bird strikes can be particularly risky for flights. The 2009 \\\"Miracle on the Hudson\\\" — when Captain Chesley \\\"Sully\\\" Sullenberger landed an Airbus A320 on New York's Hudson River — occurred after it encountered a flock of Canada geese, resulting in both engines shutting down.",

    "text": "Severe thunderstorms raced across the Plains and the Midwest on Wednesday, dropping hail as large as 5 inches in diameter in Minnesota, with a 4-inch-diameter stone reported in Prairie View, Kansas. The Minnesota hailstone may have been the largest reported in the state in 38 years. Winds gusted over 90 mph at several locations in Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. One of the thunderstorm complexes overtook Omaha, Nebraska, Wednesday evening, prompting severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. The storm transformed day into night, prompting social media videos showing intense, hurricanelike conditions as winds gusted to 90 mph at Eppley Airfield. A tornado was reported by authorities near Council Bluffs, Iowa, and a 911 call center filed a report of a tornado near Murray, Nebraska, on the Missouri River. More than 250,000 customers were without power on Wednesday night, according to PowerOutage.US, but less than 200,000 Thursday morning. Most of those, 155,000, were in Nebraska around Omaha. The storms will move into the Ohio Valley on Thursday and will reach the East Coast Friday through the weekend.",
