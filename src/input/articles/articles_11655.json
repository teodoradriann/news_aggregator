    "title": "Who were the pilots of doomed Air India flight as preliminary report brings scrutiny?",
    "text": "Who were the pilots of doomed Air India flight as preliminary report brings scrutiny?\nOne pilot was nearing retirement while the other just beginning his aviation career\nAn initial investigation into the ill-fated Air India flight that crashed last month has put the spotlight back on its two pilots after it revealed moments of confusion in the cockpit.\nThe preliminary report published by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau found that the fuel control switches were moved to the “cut-off” position almost simultaneously, starving the engines of fuel. The brief information comes from the assessment of the voice recorder from the black boxes of the plane.\nMoments after the takeoff on a clear day at 1.37pm local time on 12 June, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London from the Indian city of Ahmedabad began to lose thrust and sink, the report said.\nOf the 242 people onboard flight AI171 to London Gatwick, 241 were killed, including 53 British nationals. Only one passenger – a British-Indian man seated in 11A – survived. Nineteen more people died after the plane crashed into a medical college building, taking the death toll to 260.\nThe report stopped short of attributing blame, but cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking, “Why did you cut it off” – with the second replying that he had not cut off the fuel.\nEven the insinuation that a pilot’s error could be behind the crash has angered the community. An Indian pilots’ association rejected the presumption of pilot error in the Ahmedabad crash.\nThe Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA-India), which represents Indian pilots at the Montreal-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations, called for \"fair, fact-based inquiry.\"\n\"The pilots body must now be made part of the probe, at least as observers,\" ALPA India president Sam Thomas said on Sunday.\nCaptain Sumeet Sabharwal\nSabharwal, 56, started his aviation career in the early 1990s and logged more than 15,000 hours of flying experience. Joining Air India in 1994 he went on to become “line training captain”, a role to train and guide co-pilots during live flights. He had obtained clearances to fly as pilot-in-command on several aircraft including the Boeing 787 and 777 and the Airbus A310.\nOut of his total flying experience of 15,638 hours, 8,596 hours were on a Boeing 787.\nSabharwal, a pilot from Mumbai’s Powai suburb, was widely regarded as disciplined and professional, with no complaints ever filed against him. Friends and family remember him as a soft-spoken and humble man.\nThough he never married or had children, he shared a close bond with his 88-year-old father, Pushkaraj.\nMonths away from his retirement, Sabharwal had planned to stay full-time with his father at home to take care of him.\nHis neighbours earlier told The Indian Express that he had been looking forward to spending more time at home and caring for his ageing parent.\nOn the day of the crash, he reportedly called his father from the airport shortly before boarding, saying, “I’ll call you once I reach London.” That call never came.\nSabharwal is survived by his elder sister, who lives in Delhi. Both her sons, inspired by their uncle, have become commercial pilots.\nFirst officer Clive Kunder\nUnlike Captain Sabharwal, first officer Cliver Kunder, 32, was at the beginning of a promising aviation career, with over 3,400 hours of flight time to his name.\nKunder grew up in Mumbai and was living alone in the Goregaon area. According to Indian media reports citing relatives, he had dreamt of flying since childhood. He began his journey as a pilot in 2012 and joined Air India in 2017.\nHis commercial pilot’s licence, issued in 2020, was valid until 26 September 2025. He had obtained clearances to fly Cessna 172 and Piper PA-34 Seneca aircraft as pilot-in-command and as co-pilot on Airbus A320 and Boeing 787 jets.\nKunder was also looking forward to a new chapter in his personal life – he was just two months away from his wedding.\nAt his funeral at Sewri Christian Cemetery near his home, Steffi Miranda, a close friend from Wilson College, addressed the gathering of family and friends.\n“Seventeen years ago, we met Clive for the first time. Since then, we watched him grow, evolve, and soar,” she said.\n“Though grief surrounds us, there is pride too – in who Clive became. He hasn’t left us; he’s only flying higher now.”\nThe two pilots’ ties to aviation began at home – Sabharwal’s father, Pushkaraj, had retired from India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), and Kunder’s mother was a former Air India flight attendant.\nOn Monday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said both pilots passed the mandatory pre-flight breathalyser tests, and there were no observations about their medical status.\n“The Air India crash investigation is far from over,” Mr Wilson said, adding that the airline continues to cooperate fully with authorities, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.\nHowever, he cautioned against \"premature conclusions\" amid growing scrutiny over the preliminary investigation.\nIn the final words of one of the pilots, most likely of Sabharwal, made a distressed transmission, saying: “Thrust not achieved… falling… Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",

    "text": "Charter Communications is shutting down its call center in Worcester, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice from the Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development.\nThe letter, dated March 26, reads that Charter Communications decided to close its Customer Operations department at 95 Higgins St. in Worcester. The 174 employees who work at the call center are anticipated to lose their jobs by June 26. It is possible that one or multiple employees will remain employed for a limited time to assist with administrative tasks related to the facility closure, the letter reads.\nDespite the closure of the call center, the letter reads that the entire facility at 95 Higgins St. will not be closed as a result of the call center’s closure.\nEmployees currently working at the call center are being given the option to relocate to other locations and are eligible to receive relocation benefits, according to reporting from the Telegram & Gazette. Current employees are also being offered severance benefits including salary continuation, continuation of the company contribution toward health insurance, and outplacement services, the Telegram & Gazette reported.\nCharter Communications is a broadband connectivity company that operates under the Spectrum brand.\nThe City of Worcester has been in negotiations with Charter for a new contract. The talks are still ongoing, and the closure of the call center will not affect them, according to Thomas Matthews, a spokesman for City Manager Eric D. Batista.",

    "title": "Northern lights could be visible in Colorado’s High Country tonight thanks to solar storm",
    "text": "Colorado’s night sky could be in for yet another light show tonight thanks to the arrival of a severe geomagnetic storm.\nThe aurora borealis — informally referred to as the northern lights — is a natural phenomenon that occurs when particles spewed by solar activity from the sun interact with Earth’s protective magnetic field.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the collision produces light “much like how electrons flowing through gas in a neon light collide with neon and other gasses to produce different colored light.”\nSeveral times already this year the aurora has been visible in Colorado, with the most recent sighting occuring earlier this week . Experts say it’s due to an increase in solar activity .\n“The sun goes through a period of high activity and low activity over 11 years, and we’re in that period of peak activity,” said Bryan Brasher, who works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center .\nTonight’s potential for another northern lights sighting is the result of a massive solar flare that occurred on Oct. 8. The flare, a “big flash of light” creating a “tremendous release of energy,” sent billions of tons of plasma hurtling through space at a speed of millions of miles per hour.\n“The question is, ‘Is it directed at us?’ And we believe it to be,” Brasher said.\nThe agency today issued a rare warning to alert power grid operators, satellite and telecommunication companies to prepare for potential impacts to services caused by the storm’s current.\nWhile the agency is anticipating a G4 storm, referring to a four out of five rating on the geomagnetic storm scale , Brasher said he doesn’t expect it will lead to widespread power outages in Colorado.\nAs for the northern lights, Brasher said the best chance for viewing will be at midnight tonight, though it’s uncertain how strong of a show it will be.\n“I think there is certainly a higher chance than not that if you are on the Western Slope and you look North that you’ll see the aurora,” Brasher said. “But it could diminish.”\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Zach Hiris said there is also potential for cloud coverage this evening “that is likely going to limit the view somewhat, especially in the High Country.”\n“There’s certainly the potential to see through that,” he said. “But it’s not going to be a perfectly clear night.”\nBrasher said the lights, if visible, will be more faint to the naked eye and could look similar to smoke or haze with a green hue. To capture the best colors, Brasher recommends taking a long exposure photo with either a phone or camera. The less light pollution, the better.\nBrasher said there is a chance the solar storm’s impacts could persist into tomorrow, but tonight will be the strongest chance to catch the light show.\nThe probability of catching the phenomenon will likely remain high for “several years” due to the increase in solar activity, with Brasher adding, “there should certainly be future opportunities through 2025 and perhaps even 2026 to see these in Colorado”",

    "text": "La Gestoría Autonómica de Cataluña ha decretado que las fiestas de Navidad sean sustituidas por las fiestas del Solsticio de Invierno . Su consejera de Igualdades y feminismos ha decidido que el caganer (cagón) sea una caganera (cagona), el tronco Tió una tronca Tiona y Papá Noel sea mamá y no papá. En su belén desaparece la Madre de Dios y hay dos santos José homosexuales con niño Jesús comprado o alquilado. La televisión pública que controlan, manipulan y censuran también divulgó otro Belén con dos Vírgenes María lesbianas y sin San José. Al cúmulo de estupideces se ha sumado aquel exjefe de la Gestoría que vendía seguros y ratafía. No acepta Nochebuena y Nochevieja y las llama únicamente Nit de Nadal y Nit de Cap d’any . No son bromas de ayer, día de los Santos Inocentes. Sino idioteces y ridículos de un partido más de derechas que el Papa de Roma y relleno de ineptos e hijos y nietos de carlistas y franquistas . Como es el caso del gestor jefe que felicita el Ramadán a los sarracenos de Cataluña y falta el respeto a los republicanos católicos. Analistas de fenómenos paranormales del republicanismo ven en este anti-catolicismo un ataque del gestorcillo al beato santurrón que preside su mismo partido.\nLa consejera de supuestas igualdades es Tania Verge. Una seguramente acomplejada por cargar con su nombre hipocorístico de la rusa Santa Tatiana y su apellido virginal. Nacida en Reus, pertenece al clan de la avellana de ERC, con ya momias políticas como Carod y Benach. En cuanto a la nueva Caganera, hay quien ve en ella a Marta Rovira , la secretaria general del partido que huyó a Suiza, donde vive como una reina y teme volver a España. La Sección Femenina de Verge ha inventado un Calendario de Adviento Feminista donde cada día reivindica consignas bobas como “no a los juguetes sexistas” o “no a la presión estética”, sin especificar qué es. Licenciada en ciencias políticas, vive desde siempre del negocio feminista y malbarata un presupuesto anual de 116 millones de euros públicos. Su perverso concepto de la igualdad la llevó a desear que la lotería toque sólo “a todas las mujeres”, que el sorteo de Día del Niño sea de la Niña y otras discriminaciones para heterosexuales que trabajan, pagan impuestos y no viven de subvenciones ni de enchufes políticos.\nDecía un antiguo refrán que los catalanes de las piedras hacen panes . Pero gracias a su Gestoría Autonómica algunos catalanes han avanzado una barbaridad y se dedican a negocios y negociados como el falso feminismo , los apocalipsis climáticos , las bicocas alternativas , la nueva religión salva-planetas y la moda del neocapitalismo woke americano. Otra de sus memeces consiste en acabar con el tortell (roscón) de Reyes. Para ello, un supermercado independentista vende un roscón sin corona ni rey y los suplanta con una barretina y un caganer (no caganera). El resumen de tanto sindiós son contradicciones y desvaríos dignos de que baje Dios y vea si esta tropa de impostores y farsantes son republicanos. Porque los fanáticos y el fanatismo no tienen ninguna lógica. Aunque intenten hacernos comulgar con ruedas de molino.",

    "text": "[Sociedad](/actualidad/sociedad/) Mario Ríos, presidente de los Cristianos: “Estamos de moda con 60 nuevas altas este año” Ríos pasó por el espacio Embajada para repasar la actualidad de su comparsa y contar cómo se trabaja en los boatos Entrevista a Marío Ríos, presidente de la Comparsa Cristianos Elda 10:40 Compartir El código iframe se ha copiado en el portapapeles Elda Con tan solo dos años en la presidencia de la [Comparsa Cristianos de Elda](https://www.facebook.com/cristianoselda/?locale=es_ES), Mario Ríos ha conseguido uno de los retos que se propuso cuando asumió el cargo. Y es que la comparsa ya cuenta con un traje oficial que representa a todos los comparsistas; se trata de \"un peto económico y accesible para todos\". Además, ha hecho un balance muy positivo de la presidencia, ya que está “muy contento porque hemos dado la talla”, contando con 60 altas nuevas y sumando más de 700 socios. La gala realizada el pasado sábado tuvo un protagonista especial, y es que este año la Comparsa de Cristianos contó con un pregonero; hablamos del ex embajador cristiano Luis Miguel Amorós. Durante la gala, se reconoció todo el esfuerzo a los comparsistas, algo que el presidente considera “muy importante”. Pero lo que más destaca Mario es que este año la comparsa saca a la calle tanto el boato de la Entrada Cristiana como el boato del Desfile Infantil. El responsable del proyecto es Javier Quintanilla; proyecto que lleva pensando desde el verano y que cuenta con 40 personas divididas en cinco equipos: comunicación, costura, artesanía, construcción y música. La sede suele ser el local donde los diferentes equipos se reúnen para trabajar, pero el equipo de costura, formado por unas seis mujeres, tiene un local particular donde pasa las tardes de lunes a viernes de 15h a 20h. Una jornada intensa donde se encargan de realizar los trajes y todo lo que compone los boatos.",
