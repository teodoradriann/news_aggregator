    "title": "Stephen Colbert mocks Ohio Supreme Court boneless wings decision",
    "text": "Late night talk show host Stephen Colbert has a bone to pick with the Ohio Supreme Court over its ruling in a boneless chicken wing case . \"In poultry adjudication news, the Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that chicken wings advertised as boneless can have bones. Then what's the point of anything?!\" Colbert said in mock exasperation. Under this rationale, orange juice advertised as fresh-squeezed could be 6 months old, the comedian said on \"The Late Show.\" Colbert called it \"hot legal garbage.\" The court issued its 4-3 decision in July. 'No breach of a duty': Ohio Supreme Court says boneless chicken wings can have bones Republicans on the court ruled that bones are a natural part of chicken so a consumer should be on guard for them − even in boneless wings. “There is no breach of a duty when the consumer could have reasonably expected and guarded against the presence of the injurious substance in the food,” Republican Justice Joe Deters wrote for the majority. But Democrats on the court called that reasoning absurd. They contended that a jury, not appeals court judges, should decide whether customers should expect to find bones in boneless wings. 'I'll never be the same': Man at center of viral boneless wing lawsuit speaks out In April 2016, Michael Berkheimer ordered boneless wings with parmesan garlic sauce at Wings on Brookwood in Hamilton. On the third piece, he felt \"something go down the wrong pipe.\" He unsuccessfully tried clearing his throat and later that night, started to run a fever. The next day, a doctor removed the chicken bone but Berkheimer ended up with an infection and endured two surgeries. In 2017, Berkheimer sued the restaurant owners as well as the chicken suppliers and processors. The Butler County Common Pleas Court trial judge decided that consumers should be on guard against the possibility of bones in boneless chicken. The 12th District Court of Appeals agreed. The Ohio Supreme Court heard the case in December 2023. Berkheimer's attorneys have asked the court to reconsider its decision, which has made international headlines. Justices will likely vote on whether to reconsider later this month. Laura A.

    "text": "A HARWICH GP has been taken out of “special measures” and has now been rated good. The announced inspection was carried out in September “to follow up on” the breaches of regulation found from the last unannounced inspection in August, 2022. The two previous breaches in regulations were the failure to ensure care and treatment was provided in a safe way to patients, and to establish “effective systems and processes” which met the fundamental standards of care. The report said the practice was now being taken “out of special measures” and announced the “conditions imposed on the provider’s registration” were to be removed. After reviewing patient records in line with data sharing, conducting staff interview, and a short site visit, the report said: “The way the practice was led and managed promoted the delivery of high-quality, patient-centred care”. “No breaches of regulations” were identified but the G.P practice was advised to continue to make improvements. In the ‘safe’, ‘effective’, ‘caring’, and ‘responsive’ categories, the surgery was rated as good. While, in the “well-led” category, the practice was labelled as “requires movement”. However, in 2022 - after last being inspected as good overall in 2017- the practice was rated as either inadequate or 'requires improvement' in all five categories. With three G.P doctors, the [practice](https://fronksroadsurgery.co.uk/) delivers “General Medical services” to a patient population of 4,800 and has a nursing team of five.

    "text": "Jerusalem, Mar 28, 2024 / 17:15 pm On Holy Thursday, the doors of the Cenacle in Jerusalem were opened to welcome the Franciscans of the Custody of the Holy Land. In this “Upper Room,” called the Cenacle in the Holy Land, Jesus had his Last Supper, washed his apostles’ feet, and instituted the Eucharist. It was here that the Franciscans celebrated the Mass of the Lord’s Supper, reenacting those same gestures. (At the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher, however, the celebration is held on Thursday morning due to the Status Quo. [Here](https://lpj.org/en/news/homily-for-holy-thursday) is Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa’s homily from that Mass.) The custos of the Holy Land, Father Francesco Patton, presided over the Eucharistic celebration at the Cenacle. In his homily, before washing the feet of six teachers and six students from the Terra Sancta School in Jerusalem, he emphasized the value of the “new commandment” that Jesus gave to his apostles here: “As I have loved you, so you also should love one another” (Jn 13:34).",

    "title": "Prozess um „Weinlese der Schande\" startet in Frankreich",
    "text": "Champagner gilt als sprudelnder Luxus und Symbol für die französische Lebensart - schlimme Fälle der Ausbeutung von Erntehelfern aber sorgen nun für Wirbel. Nach dem unwürdigen Einsatz Dutzender afrikanischer Erntehelfer bei der Champagner-Ernte 2023 startet am Donnerstag vor dem Landgericht in Châlons-en-Champagne ein Prozess. Es geht um Menschenhandel sowie die Förderung und Inanspruchnahme von Schwarzarbeit. Von der „Weinlese der Schande“ sprechen französische Medien. Die Situation, die die von Anwohnern alarmierte Polizei im September 2023 in der Ortschaft Nesle-le-Repons vorfand, war Medienberichten zufolge erschütternd: Knapp 60 Erntehelfer, die meisten aus Mali, dem Senegal oder Mauretanien, die zumeist keine Aufenthaltspapiere und Arbeitserlaubnis haben, wurden in vollkommen verdreckten Gebäuden zusammengepfercht. Viele mussten demnach auf dem Boden schlafen, Essen und Trinken gab es für die Männer, die elf Stunden in der Hitze schuften müssen, wenig. „Wir mussten wie die Tiere arbeiten“, zitiert die Zeitung „Le Parisien“ einen der Arbeiter, Mamadou. Der versprochene Tageslohn von 80 Euro soll nicht an die Helfer ausgezahlt worden sein. Von Sklaverei spricht Anwalt Maxime Cessieux, der viele der Männer vertritt. Unter den 57 betroffenen Erntehelfern, die vor Gericht als Nebenkläger auftreten, sind 9 Frauen. Einer der Helfer war damals noch minderjährig, ein anderer bereits 64 Jahre alt, wie der Sender France 3 berichtete. Von „Lebens- und Unterbringungsbedingungen, die die Sicherheit, Gesundheit und Würde der Bewohner ernsthaft gefährden“, spricht später die Staatsanwaltschaft. Eine Vermittlungsfirma für Agrarhelfer, deren Geschäftsführerin, zwei Anwerber und ein Weinbauunternehmen müssen sich nun vor dem Landgericht verantworten. Gewerkschaften und Sozialverbände beklagen, dass es sich nicht um Einzelfälle handelt. 2018 bereits wurden ähnliche Missstände beim Einsatz von 125 ausländischen Erntehelfer aufgedeckt. Ein Gericht in Reims verhängte 2022 Haft- und Geldstrafen gegen die Verantwortlichen. Von der französischen Liga für Menschenrechte (LDH) hieß es, landwirtschaftliche Betriebe blieben rechtlose Zonen, die Landwirte hätten am liebsten ein Ende aller Sozial- und Umweltstandards. Die Regierung lasse ausländische Arbeitnehmer mit oder ohne Aufenthaltstitel in Stich. „Die Erntehelfer, die Opfer von Menschenhandel geworden sind, müssen ihre Rechte wiedererlangen. Sie werden sich nicht beugen, sondern aufrecht stehen und Gerechtigkeit fordern.“ Mit einem Bus, den die Gewerkschaft CGT bereitstellt, sollen die Helfer aus dem Großraum Paris zu dem Prozess in die Champagne gefahren werden. Champagner darf nur in bestimmten Gebieten in Frankreich angebaut werden. Die rund 34.000 Hektar Anbaufläche befinden sich in der Champagne nordöstlich von Paris. Die Verarbeitung der Trauben ist streng reglementiert. Beispielsweise dürfen sie nur per Hand geerntet werden. Über 100.000 Saisonarbeiter und Erntehelfer kommen während der Weinlese in der Region zum Einsatz.",

Los irresponsables son estos dos que hacen la guerra.

Es algo malo\".\nEl Papa piensa que los agredidos son también culpables. Raro para quien dice predicar el amor\n[#10](c10#c-10) Ucrania ya ganó la guerra\nNi el gobierno \"nazi\" fue depuesto\nLa OTAN está mucho mas al este que antes, con mas miembros y mas presupuesto\nNo tienen ni el corredor hasta Transnistria\nNi politica\nNi geopolítica\nNi territoriorialmente\nRusia cumple objetivos\nAhora, se negociará cuando Ucrania de rearme, recupere territorios robados desde 2014 y en el proceso de paz estara la entrega, para ser juzgado, de Putin como criminal de guerra\nDejemos que los ucranianos decidan libremente su futuro en las próximas elecciones...\nAh! No! Que tienen prohibida a la oposición y encarcelados (los que no han sido asesinados) a los disidentes. Y el país tan endeudado que no pueden hacer otra cosa que no sea lo que le digan sus dueños extranjeros. Eso sin contar con el tema de la corrupción endémica que compra voluntades en muchos casos para poder sobrevivir.\nSi se hubiera dedicado a lo que prometió cuando lo eligieron: acabar con la guerra civil y conseguir la reconciliación nacional. Pero se dejó engañar por los cantos de sirena y ahora va camino de ser otro Sadam Hussein engañado por el Imperio, aunque aún está a tiempo de terminar como otro Guaidó refugiado.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Hay partidos opositores en el parlamento ucraniano.\nAhora moverás la portería a que no son opositores de verdad.\n[#12](c12#c-12) No se que te metes pero si crees lo que dices sabes que esa tumba va a ser a costa de muchas muertes o algo peor en todo Europa.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Ucrania no se puede permitir perder porque si lo hace, se convertira en un títere de Rusia o Rusia volverá a invadirla más adelante para seguir robando territorio. Las declaraciones de algunos dirigentes europeos como Macron pueden darnos pistas...\n[#41](c41#c-41) Ucrania no decide, si la OTAN le dice que negicie, lo hará, y si para eso pierde 1/3 del país, pues... haber negociado en el 2022.\n[#12](c12#c-12) También lo hace. Pero les gusta más este titular.\nPor contra, su homólogo ortodoxo se dedica a bendecir tanques y dar medallas a los soldados\n[#4](c4#c-4) ¿Tú en serio crees que puede? ¿ Puede el sahara español decidir su futuro ? pues no, y lo sabes. ¿Pueden los gazatíes decidir su futuro? pues tampoco, y lo sabes, y así hasta el infinito. ¿Puede el Nepal decidir su futuro si a China se le pone entre ceja y ceja la idea de asaltarla? pues tampoco, podríamos seguir contínuamente. Sólo te salvas si tienes al \"primo de zumosol\" que te apoya o bien formas parte de algo más grande como la otan, pero en caso contrario lo tienes clarinete, pero vamos, que esto habrá sido así desde que el mundo es mundo, ¿Puede un conejo decidir su futuro si un depredador ya lo ha atrapado? no se.. es lo mismo. Al margen de si está bien o está mal, el mundo no va de eso.\n[#27](c27#c-27) [#35](c35#c-35) [#52](c52#c-52) [#38](c38#c-38) Pero si es lo que ha dicho.\nEcha culpa también a los agredidos, Palestina y Ucrania.\nNo estoy de acuerdo, pero le reconozco que no sea hipócrita. Algo que no se puede decir de los putinejos, a los que el genocidio en Palestina les rompió el argumentario y convirtió en meme.\nhttps://www.vaticannews.va/es/papa/news/2024-03/papa-francisco-entrevista-redio-television-suiza-marzo-2024.html\nla guerra la hacen dos, no uno. Los irresponsables son estos dos que hacen la guerra. Luego no sólo hay guerra militar, sino que está la \"guerra de guerrillas\", por así decirlo, de Hamás, por ejemplo, un movimiento que no es un ejército.

Porque entonces alguno podría decir que \"Es más, hay quien opina que ese territorio, ya es Israel\" y echarnos unas risas.\nBueno, pues si lo dice el Papa, habrá que hacerle caso, no? Que le pida a Putin tener el coraje de reconocer que la ha liado y se retire fuera de Ukrania.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Hasta que no acabe la guerra sigue siendo Ucrania. Luego, dependerá de como se firme la paz... una paz que tendrá que llegar algún día.\n[#44](c44#c-44) Realmente no es asi, un territorio le pertenece de facto a quien puede ejercer la soberania sobre el, ahora mismo Crimea es Rusia porque Rusia ejercer la soberania sobre ella.\nLuego esta el reconocimiento internacional, que es otra otra, por ejemplo Kosovo para algunos paises sigue siendo parte de Serbia y para otros es un estado independiente, pero de facto, como comentaba antes, es un estado independiente.\nNormalmente cuando se termina una guerra y se firma la paz eso da pie a que el resto de paises acepten, o no, pero normalmente si, lo que se haya firmado y reconozcan las nuevas fronteras.\n[#7](c7#c-7) bueno siguiendo esta logica. En Cisjordania, ese territorio ya es de Israel de facto. Que los palestinos firmen la paz y listo.\n[#54](c54#c-54) En Cisjordania no hay ni un solo Palestino que reconozca esa tierra como parte de Israel.\nEn el Donbass hay una gran poblacion que reconoce esa tierra como Rusia.\nPero seguid haciendo comparaciones estupidas, de cosas que no tienen nada que ver.\nYo entiendo que algunas mentes simples dan para lo que dan, pero las cosas son como son\n[#7](c7#c-7) Si partimos de la base de que Ucrania no debe ceder territorio a Rusia, entonces no hay acuerdo de paz posible y seguirán muriendo ucranianos.\nEse argumento solamente es válido cuando se tiene la convicción de que se va a ganar la guerra, lo cual no es el caso. Ucrania ahora mismo va perdiendo.\nPor tanto, la negativa a entregar territorio a Rusia es en este momento insensata, aunque muy fácil de recomendar desde el sofá cuando los que van a morir son otros.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Posiblemente en una negociación sensata incluso recupere algo del territorio que ya tiene perdido.\n[#3](c3#c-3) No se trata de que entregue o no territorio, se trata de que las guerras se pierden o se ganan, y cuando una guerra está perdida y los mandos siguen enviando a sus soldados (reclutados en gran porcentaje a la fuerza) a la muerte, se considera un crimen de guerra. Ucrania tiene perdida la guerra hace mucho tiempo. Si siguen con la guerra, lo único que queda es que una de dos, o bien suceda eso de hasta el último hombre o que nos envíen al resto de cabeza a una guerra que nada tiene que ver con nosotros.\n[#27](c27#c-27) Palestina no está en guerra. Lo que se está cometiendo allí es un genocidio. La comparación es repugnante.\n[#35](c35#c-35) Lo repugnante es pensar que el agresor no es el culpable.\nEl argumento de los que defienden el genocidio israelí es el mismo, que los culpables son los palestinos y son ellos lo que tienen que rendirse. Algunos usan el mismo argumento en el tema de la invasión rusa a Ucrania.\nYo veo a ambos repugnantes.\n\"[...] Cuando ves que estás derrotado, que las cosas no van, necesitas tener el coraje de negociar”. Supongo que el Papa estará informado de la situación sobre el terreno como para decir eso.\nQue hubieran invertido en armamento en su momento o integrado en la OTAN. Ahora a ceder en lo que pida Rusia.",
