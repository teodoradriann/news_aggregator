    "text": "En diciembre de 2023, Juan Camilo Portilla se convirtió en la mina de oro de América de Cali después de firmar su paso al fútbol argentino. El mediocampista fue vendido por 1,8 millones de euros (7,6 mil millones de pesos) a Talleres de Córdoba y se convirtió en un cafetero más en conquistar la tierra de Lionel Messi. Tras sus buenas actuaciones en los diablos rojos, se esperaba que en el equipo de la \"T\" también fuera importante; y sin decepcionar, ha logrado hacerse con la titular y brillar a tal nivel que fue convocado por Néstor Lorenzo para hacer parte de la selección Colombia, equipo con el que nunca ha jugado.\n📝 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚 𝐅𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐅𝐈𝐅𝐀 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐜𝐢𝐨́𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐚 𝐝𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐲𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐬— Selección Colombia (@FCFSeleccionCol)\nEllos son los elegidos por Néstor Lorenzo para enfrentar a 🇪🇸 y 🇷🇴 el 22 y 26 de marzo.\n🔗\n [#TodosSomosColombia]🇨🇴 [pic.twitter.com/1ib9VqWWUP] [March 14, 2024]\n| Vea también:\nSe le adelantaron a Néstor Lorenzo: El juvenil colombiano que juega en el Real y fue convocado por España\nY es que, aunque esta no es la primera convocatoria de Juan Camilo Portilla al equipo nacional, pues a inicios de 2023 fue llamado también por Néstor Lorenzo para hacer parte de la plantilla que disputó el amistoso contra Estados Unidos en Los Ángeles, California, el joven jugador no ha tenido minutos dentro de la cancha vestido de amarillo, pues en ese compromiso no ingresó al terreno de juego. Es por eso que estos partidos contra España y Rumania podrían ser decisivos para su debut en la tricolor, pues su buen momento lo hace merecedor de estar en el terreno de juego.\nLos números con los que llega Juan Camilo Portilla a la selección Colombia\nHay que recordar que los números del mediocampista nacido en Santiago de Cali han sido muy buenos en 2024. En Talleres ha disputado 10 partidos, todos como titular, y ya suma 4 asistencias y 1 gol. Su incidencia en el fútbol del equipo argentino ha sido tan evidente, que desde tierras gauchas ya lo inclinan como un jugador que está alistando las maletas para irse al fútbol europeo, así como lo hicieron algunos de sus compatriotas como Radamel Falcao García o James Rodríguez.",

    "title": "AB9 - ABO Wind AG will capitalize on Europe's green transition with projected €50 million profit by 2027",
    "text": "Last Update28 Jul 25\nThe recent tariff agreements between the United States and the European Union, signed on July 28, 2025, could have indirect implications for companies like ABO Wind, although the company is not specifically mentioned in the current reports. Here's how they might affect you:\n🔍 Tariff Agreement Summary A general tariff of 15% has been established for most European products exported to the US, thus avoiding a 30% tariff that had been initially proposed The agreement includes \"zero tariffs\" on strategic products, such as some agricultural, chemical, aeronautics, and semiconductor products The EU pledges to buy $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest another $600 billion in the U.S., which could affect the energy and trade balance\n🌍 Potential impact on ABO Wind ABO Wind is a German company specialized in the development of renewable energy projects, mainly in Europe and Latin America. Although it has not been directly mentioned in connection with this agreement, there are several factors to consider:\n- Energy competition: Europe's commitment to buy large volumes of U.S. energy could reduce demand for local renewable projects if some of that energy comes from non-renewable sources or if imports are prioritized over domestic development.\n- Export costs: If ABO Wind exports components or services to the U.S., the new 15% tariff could make its operations in that market more expensive, although it is unclear whether its products are included in the list of zero-tariff exceptions.\n- Stock market: European stock markets have reacted with slight increases after the agreement, indicating a perception of stability. However, specific actions such as those of ABO Wind (AB9. F) have not shown any notable movements related to this issue in recent days.\n- Opportunities in Latin America: ABO Wind continues to expand in markets such as Colombia, where it recently signed a deal for a 19.9 MW solar park This suggests that its international strategy could be more focused on regions outside the EU-US axis. This partially protects it from these agreements.\n🔍 1. Overview of ABO Wind AG\nABO Wind AG is a German company specializing in the development of renewable energy projects, primarily wind and solar. Founded in 1996, it operates in over 16 countries and has developed more than 3,600 MW of renewable capacity. Its business model covers everything from planning to construction and operation of energy parks.\n📊 Financial Situation and Outlook\n- In 2024, ABO Wind reported a net profit of €25.6 million, the second-highest in its history.\n- For 2025, the company projects profits between €29 and €39 million, with expectations to reach €50 million annually starting in 2027.\n- The stock has shown strong performance in 2025, hitting a new 6-month high and maintaining a clear upward trend.\n🌍 Benefit from European and German Aid\n✅ 1. Subsidies and Guaranteed Tariffs (EEG)\n- ABO Wind benefits from Germany’s regulated tariff system (EEG), which guarantees a minimum price per kWh generated. In 2025, it won tenders for over 120 MW in wind projects, with average tariffs of 6.83 cents/kWh.\n- These tariffs have been state-funded since 2022, reducing financial risk for developers like ABO Wind.\n✅ 2. Favorable European Regulation\n- The EU has accelerated permitting for renewable projects under the REPowerEU plan, allowing ABO Wind to submit over 850 MW in applications in the first half of 2025 alone.\n- The end of the EU’s emergency regulation created a “rush” in applications, which ABO Wind has capitalized on with an aggressive expansion strategy.\n✅ 3. Next Generation EU Funds\n- While not explicitly mentioned in ABO Wind’s reports, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) funded by Next Generation EU supports innovative renewable and storage projects.\n- ABO Wind, with operations in Europe: Germany (headquarters), Spain, France, Finland, Ireland, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Netherlands, also United Kingdom, America: Argentina, Colombia, Canada, Africa: Tunisia, South Africa, Tanzania, could benefit indirectly through partnerships or project sales, as it has already done with Endesa.\n- Also United Kingdom, America: Argentina, Colombia, Canada, Africa: Tunisia, South Africa, Tanzania.\n🧠 Fundamental Analysis\nIndicatorValue / CommentRevenue 2024~€200M (estimated from project growth)Net Profit 2024€25.6MProfit Forecast 2025€29–39MEstimated P/E RatioModerate, with growth potentialDebtControlled, many projects self-financedExpected GrowthHigh, driven by tenders and international expansionCompetitive AdvantageExperience, geographic diversification, vertical integration\n📈 Conclusion\nABO Wind AG is in a strong position to capitalize on Europe’s energy transition momentum. Government and EU subsidies, along with a favorable regulatory environment and an expanding project pipeline, reinforce its profile as a sustainable growth stock in the renewable energy sector.\nHow well do narratives help inform your perspective?\nDisclaimer\nThe user kapirey has a position in XTRA:AB9.

    "text": "Retailers are scrambling to get goods into the country as the crucial ferry route from Holyhead to Dublin has been closed for five days due to damage caused by Storm Darragh.\nJust two weeks before Christmas, hauliers have warned that ‘disastrous’ backlogs will cause serious disruptions to trade and prevent people receiving some deliveries in time.\nGer Hyland, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) , said: ‘People are expecting items to be delivered for December 25 that won’t arrive on time and shops won’t get stock.\n‘As an industry, we’re used to delays of a day or two. But this is unique. A five-day supply line being cut the week before Christmas will have a devastating impact. Our trailers are sitting on the far side of the Irish Sea.’\nWhile a limited service is expected to resume later this evening, Mr Hyland pointed out that the route was expected to reopen by Monday, and every day since. Photographer: Patrick Bolger/Bloomberg via Getty Images While a limited service is expected to resume later this evening, Mr Hyland pointed out that the route was expected to reopen by Monday, and every day since. ‘But I don’t know when now,’ he added. ‘Lots of Christmas stuff is being held up: clothes, fragrances, foodstuffs.’\nHe said that a backlog normally takes three to four days to clear after two days of disruption, but this is now being compounded by other issues.\nMr Hyland remarked: ‘We have a driver shortage. Around 20% of our drivers will be heading off back to Eastern Europe for Christmas at the end of the week.’\nDarren Murphy, managing director of BM Transport, a haulage company based in Co. Monaghan, said: ‘It’s a disaster. Usually we have 100 trailers a day on the Holyhead [in Wales] to Dublin route.(Photo by PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images) He said trucks will be ‘going via Liverpool, Pembroke and Northern Ireland but boats are wedged’, adding: ‘There’s just not enough capacity. Trailers will be sent wherever we can get a booking.’\nDarren Murphy, managing director of BM Transport , a haulage company based in Co. Monaghan, said: ‘It’s a disaster. Usually we have 100 trailers a day on the Holyhead [in Wales] to Dublin route. There’s a major backlog of trailers out of service. I have 85 to 100 sitting in Holyhead waiting to go. There’s been 85 sitting there since 1am on Sunday waiting to go. Since Monday I’ve been trying to take them to other ports.\nRetailers are scrambling to get goods into the country as the crucial ferry route from Holyhead to Dublin has been closed for five days due to damage caused by Storm Darragh. ‘I have ten drivers stuck in Holyhead who I have no work for. It’s getting compounded every day. We carry stock for major supermarkets. Stuff which was supposed to be delivered on Monday won’t be seen until next week. It will become a bigger issue next week when people are low on stock.’\nHauliers have been forced to use alternative ports but are also facing capacity issues at those places. Rosslare Europort, which was ‘working at capacity prior’, said Mr Hyland, ‘is completely blocked up with trade at the moment’.\nA general view shows Irish ferries ro-ro ferry Ulysses unloads as Stena Adventurer arrives in Holyhead port in Anglesey, north Wales on January 02, 2021. (Photo by PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images) Mr Murphy added: ‘It’s hard to find ways around it. It’s not physically possible. You’ve got Pembroke, Liverpool, Coleraine, Heysham [as alternative routes], but because of Brexit there are customs delays when you put foodstuffs and plants through to Ireland. In Liverpool, the port is overrun. Usually you can load your trailers on ferries days in advance, but because there is physically no space, you can’t drop them until 12 hours in advance.\n‘It’s slow going via Coleraine. It takes a day and a half to ship to Belfast and then to Ireland.’\nJean McCabe, CEO of Retail Excellence Ireland, said: ‘Any disruption to logistics has the potential to have a knock-on effect on product availability in stores. A majority of retailers would be well stocked up already in the run into Christmas but it does mean some products could be out of stock as they struggle to replenish from UK fulfilment bases. The timing around Christmas isn’t ideal but retailers are finding other routes, for example through the port at Liverpool.’\nA truck at the check-in area of the Port of Holyhead in Anglesey, UK, on Friday, April 29, 2022.

Photographer: Francesca Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images The Holyhead-to-Dublin route, operated by Irish Ferries and Stena Line, has remained closed in both directions since the Welsh port’s infrastructure was damaged by Storm Darragh on Saturday.\nA spokesperson for Holyhead port originally said it was expected to reopen at 6pm on Tuesday, but all eight of yesterday’s Irish Ferries sailings from the port to Dublin were cancelled, as were the six in the other direction. Holyhead is set to reopen at 5.15pm today, although with significantly reduced capacity.\nThe IRHA criticised outgoing Minister of Transport Eamon Ryan for being ‘nowhere to be seen’ when Irish trade routes are ‘facing severe challenges’ and called on Taoiseach Simon Harris to assume responsibility for the Department of Transport. It said there has been ‘no emergency planning obvious following weekend travel disruption’.\nMr Hyland said the storm damage has exposed ‘a serious vulnerability on Irish trade, cross-Channel trade routes’, adding: ‘This has been compounded by the complete silence on the issue from the outgoing Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan.\n‘We need someone in charge of the Department of Transport who is engaged, active and accountable. As an island nation these things need to be planned.’\nA spokesperson at the Department of Transport said: ‘Since the difficulties first arose in Holyhead port, the department has been in constant contact with Dublin Port to monitor the situation and to liaise on contingency planning to avoid/reduce the possibility of congestion arising in the port or surrounding transport routes.\nHolyhead port’s closure has also impacted An Post ahead of Christmas, but not as significantly, as ‘much of its parcel traffic comes by air freight’, a spokesperson said. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) ‘The department is also engaging with the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Irish Exporters Association. The minister has been kept informed about the situation throughout. The minister would like to underline his appreciation for the flexibility and resilience shown by the maritime and haulage sectors during this challenging period.’\nHolyhead port’s closure has also impacted An Post ahead of Christmas, but not as significantly, as ‘much of its parcel traffic comes by air freight’, a spokesperson said.\nA spokesman for Dublin Port said it remains operational and has not experienced freight congestion, adding: ‘We are working closely with the operators to prepare for the resumption of Holyhead services.’\nAround 90% of Ireland’s internationally traded goods are transported by sea, according to the Irish Maritime Development Office . Last year, 113,164 trade vehicles were transported through Dublin Port.",

    "text": "[Liga MX](https://www.univision.com/temas/liga-mx) Uriel Antuna le va a hacer falta a Cruz Azul, señala Conejo Pérez Oscar Pérez habló de la decisión del jugador de irse a Tigres y aseguró que “hoy los chicos apuntan no tanto a lo deportivo”, sino a lo económico. Oscar 'Conejo' Pérez, todo un referente del arco de Cruz Azul y de la Selección Mexicana, aseguró [que a Uriel Antuna, que recientemente dejó La Máquina para irse con Tigres, le hará falta el equipo celeste. ](https://www.tudn.com/futbol/liga-mx/oficial-tigres-da-bienvenida-uriel-antuna-para-apertura-2024-liga-mx) El arquero de México en los Mundiaes de Corea Japón 2002 y Sudáfrica 2010, estuvo en el programa Faitelson Sin Censura del periodista David Faitelson, de TUDN, y ahí expresó sus ideas sobre Antuna. \"(Es) buen profesional, buen chavo, bastante bien Uriel. Tomó su decisión de moverse y nada, creo que le va a hacer falta Cruz Azul\", señaló. Girando sobre el mismo tema, Pérez piensa que el día de hoy, los futbolistas apuntan no tanto a lo deportivo sino a lo económico a la hora de contratarse. \"Antes estaba el pacto de caballeros y te quejabas, ¿no? Hoy tenemos esa posibilidad y nos vamos para el otro lado. Yo creo que sí debe haber un equilibrio en esa parte y hoy los chicos apuntan no tanto a lo deportivo, sino a otras cosas\", expresó. Incluso 'Conejo' recordó una ocasión, cuando él era parte del cuerpo técnico de Cruz Azul, en la que le llegó a Uriel una oferta de Europa, pero no era favorable para nadie y no se fue. \"Uriel tomó su decisión. Cuando yo estuve, tenía una oferta para ir al extranjero, las condiciones no eran favorables para él ni para el club, en ese momento. Él incluso se quedó un poco incómodo porque no se le había dado la oportunidad\", comentó. \"Era de Grecia, creo era el Panathinaikos. No, era ver si él rendía cuenta en seis meses, o si salía, iban a Champions, se quedaban con él o sino, se regresaba\", finalizó.",
