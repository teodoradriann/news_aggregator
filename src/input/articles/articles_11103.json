It also clarifies that the \"union\" between two members of the same sex cannot be blessed — only the individuals themselves.\nEpiscopal conferences in African nations have been the most vocal prelates opposed to the implementation of \"Fiducia supplicans\" — the document which approved pastoral blessings given to people in same-sex relationships under strict parameters.\nArchbishop George Desmond Tambala of the Lilongwe Catholic Archdiocese (C) flanked by a Muslim Sheikh (L) and other religious leaders, carries an anti-LGBTQ placard during nation-wide marches organised by churches in Malawi against same-sex marriages in Lilongwe.\n\"In order to avoid any pastoral confusion and ambiguity as well as not to break the law of our country which forbids same sex unions and activities, and while listening to our cultural heritage which does not accept same sex relationships, the Conference guides that the Declaration from the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith of December 18th 2023 concerning the blessing of same-sex couples be taken as for further reflection and not for implementation in Zambia,\" said the Zambia Episcopal Conference.\nThe Episcopal Conference of Malawi wrote in a letter, \"to avoid creating confusion among the faithful we direct that for pastoral reasons, blessings of any kind and for same sex unions of any kind are not permitted in Malawi.\"\nThe majority of bishops in the United States have vouched for the accuracy of the document's language, saying it is theologically in line with church teaching and tradition .\nOriginal article source: Vatican says bishops allowed to withhold same-sex blessings sanctioned by recent document\nView comments",

    "title": "Zweite Erde? Hoffnungen um potenziellen Erdzwilling Trappist-1 d werden enttäuscht",
    "text": "Zweite Erde? Hoffnungen um potenziellen Erdzwilling Trappist-1 d werden enttäuscht\nDie Suche nach einer zweiten Erde konzentrierte sich auf das Trappist-1-System. Nun zeigen neue Daten des „James Webb“-Teleskops ein unerwartetes Ergebnis.\nMontréal – Wenn es um Planeten außerhalb unseres Sonnensystems geht, auf denen es möglicherweise Leben geben könnte, dann fällt immer ein Name: „Trappist-1“. Dabei handelt es sich um einen roten Zwergstern, der nur etwa 40 Lichtjahre von der Erde entfernt ist und von sieben Planeten umkreist wird, die etwa erdgroß sind. Mehrere dieser Planeten befinden sich in der sogenannten „habitablen Zone“ des Sterns – das heißt, auf ihnen herrschen Temperaturen, die flüssiges Wasser an der Oberfläche möglich machen.\nDeshalb gilt das „Trappist-1“-System als die größte Hoffnung bei Forschenden, eine „zweite Erde“ im Universum zu finden. Seit das „James Webb“-Weltraumteleskop aktiv ist, kann die Forschungsgemeinschaft die „Trappist-1“-Planeten genauer untersuchen und mehr über sie herausfinden. Dabei steht vor allem eine Frage im Vordergrund: Haben die Planeten in der habitablen Zone Atmosphären?\nSuche nach einer zweiten Erde: Der Exoplanet Trappist-1 d ist es wohl nicht\n„Letztendlich möchten wir wissen, ob es irgendwo anders etwas Ähnliches wie die Umwelt gibt, die wir auf der Erde genießen, und unter welchen Bedingungen dies möglich ist“, sagt Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb (University of Chicago und Université de Montréal in einer Nasa-Mitteilung. „Während das ‚James Webb‘-Weltraumteleskop der Nasa uns erstmals die Möglichkeit gibt, diese Frage bei erdähnlichen Planeten zu untersuchen, können wir Trappist-1 d zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt von der Liste potenzieller Erdzwillinge oder -cousins ausschließen.“ Die Forschungsergebnisse wurden im Fachmagazin The Astrophysical Journal veröffentlicht.\nDer Planet Trappist-1 d ist aus der Sicht des Sterns der dritte Planet und befindet sich am Rand der habitablen Zone. Er benötigt nur vier Erdtage, um den Stern einmal zu umrunden. Mithilfe des NIRSpec-Instruments des Weltraumteleskops hat das Forschungsteam nach Molekülen Ausschau gehalten, die in der Erdatmosphäre vorkommen – beispielsweise Wasser, Methan oder Kohlendioxid. Gefunden wurden jedoch keine.\n„Webb“-Teleskop entdeckt keine Atmosphäre bei Trappist-1 d\nFür das Forschungsteam gibt es verschiedene Gründe, warum um Trappist-1 d keine Atmosphäre entdeckt wurde, wie Piaulet-Ghorayeb erklärt: „Er könnte eine extrem dünne Atmosphäre haben, die schwer zu erkennen ist, ähnlich wie auf dem Mars. Alternativ könnte es sehr dichte Wolken in großer Höhe geben, die unsere Erkennung bestimmter atmosphärischer Signaturen blockieren – eher wie auf der Venus. Oder es könnte sich um einen kargen Felsen ohne jegliche Atmosphäre handeln.“\nAllerdings befindet sich Trappist-1 d auch in einem Umfeld, das es schwer macht, eine Atmosphäre dauerhaft zu halten: Rote Zwergsterne sind bekannt dafür, dass sie sehr aktiv sind. Sie schleudern häufig Materie und hochenergetische Strahlung ins Weltall, die die Atmosphäre von kleinen Planeten wegreißen kann – vor allem, wenn die Planeten sich nahe an dem Stern befinden, wie es Trappist-1 d tut. Rote Zwergsterne sind jedoch auch die am häufigsten vorkommenden Sterne in unserer Galaxie, weshalb die Forschung hofft, Planeten zu finden, die im Orbit um einen roten Zwerg ihre Atmosphäre halten können.\nHaben die anderen Trappist-1-Planeten vielleicht Atmosphären?\n„Wir stehen noch ganz am Anfang, wenn es darum geht, mit ‚Webb‘ nach Atmosphären auf erdähnlichen Planeten zu suchen und die Grenze zwischen Planeten, die eine Atmosphäre halten können, und solchen, die dies nicht können, zu definieren“, betont Co-Autor Björn Benneke. Die Beobachtung der äußeren „Trappist-1“-Planeten mit dem „Webb“-Teleskop läuft derzeit. Wie das Ergebnis aussehen könnte, ist noch unklar. Auf der einen Seite sind die Planeten e, f, g und h weiter vom Stern entfernt – es könnte ihnen also etwas leichter fallen, ihre potenziellen Atmosphären zu halten.\nDurch ihre größere Entfernung vom Stern sind sie jedoch auch etwas kühler, was es dem Weltraumteleskop schwerer macht, atmosphärische Signaturen aufzuspüren. „Die Hoffnung für die Atmosphären der Trappist-1-Planeten ist noch nicht verloren“, muntert Piaulet-Ghorayeb auf. „Auch wenn wir auf Planet d keine deutlichen atmosphärischen Signaturen gefunden haben, besteht dennoch die Möglichkeit, dass die äußeren Planeten viel Wasser und andere atmosphärische Komponenten enthalten.“ (tab)",

    "title": "Here Comes the Rain! Flood Watch Issued for Humboldt Bay, Low-Lying Areas Along Eel River",
    "text": "###\nGet ready for a wet weekend, Humboldt!\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a flood watch for coastal communities and low-lying areas in the Eel River Valley where two to five inches of rain can be expected in the next 24 hours. Some areas of Southern Humboldt could see up to eight inches of rain in the same period.\n“You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible flood warnings,” according to the NWS flood alert. “There will be an increased risk of rock and landslides along roadways. … Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.”\nHumboldt County Public Works has already reported closures on some county-maintained roads, including Coffee Creek and Meridian roads in Ferndale. There’s also flooding reported on Pine Hill Road. The McCann Bridge is closed but the McCann Ferry is running.\nCoastal communities should also be aware of King Tides, unusually high tides caused when the sun, moon and Earth align, creating a “stronger than normal gravitational pull” that can increase tides by one to two feet, according to the NWS. When coupled with storm surges, King Tides can dramatically increase the potential for coastal flooding and property damage.\nCoastal flooding can be expected in low-lying areas of Humboldt Bay, particularly in King Salmon and along Jackson Road in the Arcata Bottoms.\nIf you happen to capture some photos of these super-high tides, send ‘em over to the California Coastal Commission! Those interested can submit their photos to the California King Tides Project [at this link](www.coastal.ca.gov/kingtides). If you do decide to go take photos, please do so safely.\nThere’s also a high wind advisory in effect for Humboldt and Del Norte counties. Winds ranging between 25 and 35 mph can be expected, with gusts up to 60 mph across higher elevations, according to the NWS. Take extra caution while driving, especially if you have a big vehicle.\nKeep an eye on Caltrans Quickmap or the Caltrans District 1 Facebook page for current road conditions. We’ll update this post if we hear about any additional closures.\nStay safe, Humboldt!",

    "text": "Updated December, 2023\nYou’ve heard the speech about renewals over and over. No one needs to tell you that a\nsuccessful renewal strategy is critical to the growth of a SaaS company. Or that it costs five times more to recruit a new customer than to retain an existing one. However, research shows that many companies are still not giving renewals the focus they deserve. That’s a shame, because really comes down to acknowledging just two facts about why you are losing customers shows that many companies are still not giving renewals the focus they deserve. That’s a shame, because it really comes down to acknowledging just two facts about why you are losing customers.\nWhile there may be a list of possible reasons why customers leave your product, they pretty much fall under these two scenarios:\nYou Have Poor User Adoption\nTo break it down, the goal of the\nuser onboarding experience is to validate what you’ve already sold. The prospect has already converted, signed up for the free trial or purchased the subscription, and they want to be convinced. So, what should you do to optimize your user onboarding process?\nBe aware of your activation criteria.\nThe\nactivation criteria is a task or a series of tasks you suggest to your customers so they will start using your product and benefit from it.\nYou’re basically being proactive and get your customers to warm up to what they’ve purchased. Some good examples for this are:\n- LinkedIn: Connect with these people you may know.\n- Uber: Complete your first ride.\n- Gmail: Send your first email.\nYour activation criteria – sometimes also referred to as “\ngetting to the promise of your product” – comprises the actions your customers take that increase their chances of returning to your product for a second, third or fourth time. Encouraging a new user to do these things is essential for driving long term user adoption because it helps your customer to understand the value of the product and why they’re using it.\nCreate eye-opening moments\nUsers appreciate those aha moments when they discover or are exposed to a feature than can help them complete a task or solve a problem in a novel or smarter way. If possible, you should create as many of these moments as you can throughout the onboarding process.\nHow? You must fully understand the problems and buying decisions of your target audience. Map out their conversion journey based on what you know about their persona and use that data to deliver personalized tips via email, live chat, or within the product itself. App designers often use this method to acquaint new users with their products. Think about the last time you set up a new phone or Google got a redesign. These designers often guide you through the product, revealing functionality you had no idea existed. Create these eye-opening moments for your customers and you’ll not only gain their loyalty, but you’ll get their referrals too.\nEnsure stellar customer service\nNot only do you need to be sure your users can easily contact you via e-mail, on the phone, or within the product, but you need to reach out to them early and often. Not hearing from a customer after they’ve been with you for two weeks isn’t necessarily a good thing: that silence might mean everything is going fine, but it might also mean they’re already disengaged and planning on dropping you. The adoption period is the most important time for your\ncustomer success team to form a relationship with a customer, and answer questions before they even arise.\nRead between the lines of your customers’ behavior in product usage\nThe user adoption process is not limited to only getting your customers to start using your product. This is also a timeframe to keep them engaged so they would want to continue leveraging what you’re offering, establishing a long-term relationship.\nOne key aspect you should consider is identifying your\nat-risk customers. They are the ones that are most likely to quit and target them through re-engagement emails. Remind them about your product/service and give them a reason to stay – great customer service and a great customer experience are what will make or break your relationship.\nThere is a Lack of Perceived Value\nIf you are losing a customer, it most likely is because they’re not seeing the full value of your product . Value is closely related to your onboarding process, like we discussed in the above steps. However, value can diminish over time. Like any relationship, you need to take steps to nurture it.\nConsistently demonstrate value\nAnd not just by having a stellar product. Customers need to see, in concrete terms, what they are getting out of your solution on a regular basis. For instance,\nZendesk, the support ticketing software, regularly sends emails to its customers with stats on how many tickets they’ve solved, and the average ticket response time compared with the previous month. By frequently reminding customers of its value, Zendesk knows few are even going to think about going without it. The bottom line is that concrete numbers can go a long way toward making your solution seem indispensable to your customers.\nInvest in customer marketing, not just in prospects\nAs a general rule of thumb, most businesses dedicate a significant portion of their marketing budget to acquiring new customers. However, just as you nurture your new leads, you also need to nurture your existing customers in order to keep them interested in your product and your company and to increase the likelihood of them\nrenewing their contract.\nBut when is the right time to market to your existing customers? Well, there are a few:\n- New feature announcements.\n- Product updates.\n- When you notice a drop-off in their product usage or activity.\nCustomer marketing is all about keeping your product top of mind and bringing your users back to your product. Make them happy with a new feature or encourage them to keep going with their subscription plan to get ready for success.\nLeverage your user community through social proof\nYour customers need to feel confident in their choice of your product and will collect enough\nsocial proof to support their decision to pay or renew. One of the most effective ways to collect social proof is through effective use of social media channels and showing commitment to it.\nIf you don’t know how to put social proof to good use, don’t worry, we have compiled a list of some of the most popular social proof strategies in eCommerce:\n- Persona Endorsement\n- Reviews and Testimonials\n- Rating Platforms\n- Case Studies\n- Trust Badges\n- Referrals\n- Expert Reviews\nBring customers behind the scenes\nKeep users in the loop when you are developing a new module or functionality. Ask power users to test out new features and provide valuable\nfeedback. This will make them feel like part of the process, as well as provide you with crucial insights. Gain customer loyalty by showing you take their problems, feedback and comments seriously.\nAsk for help: a Subscription Management Platform could be the key\nOne of the biggest challenges that SaaS businesses face is that they have to offer a product or service on a regular basis and be able to collect online payments for those services. Companies often have to deal with frustrations on the part of the users when their subscriptions are not renewed automatically because of issues like expired cards, failed payments and so on.\n2Checkout (now Verifone) can help track closely your subscriptions business using tools such as:\n- Account Updater Service to automatically update customers’ card information\n- Internal Account Updater to increase authorization rates for expired cards\n- Advanced Retry Logic helping to recover failed transactions due to soft declines\n- Dunning Management for recovery in case of hard declines\nBonus: Find out more about optimizing the\n Entire Subscription Lifecycle for your SaaS business growth.\nConclusion\nThe two main culprits of low renewals are poor onboarding experience and a lack of perceived value. If you can proactively engage new users from the start and keep showing them the value of your service, renewals will happen naturally. This is where\ncustomer retention strategies come into play because as competition intensifies and consumer options expand, the importance of retaining your existing customers cannot be overstated.\nAnd don’t forget that it’s not just about keeping customers; it’s about building long-term relationships that will take your business to the next level in the digital world.\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.

    "title": "Ángel Mena 'opaca' el fichaje de Felipe Caicedo",
    "text": "Ángel Mena se convirtió en el fichaje más trascendente e importante de Orense en sus 15 años de vida institucional . El contrato del guayaquileño se confirmó la mañana de este jueves 16 de enero de 2025.\nCon el fichaje de Ángel Mena, la Liga Pro suma el segundo regreso más esperado , luego del de Felipe Caicedo, delantero que jugará por primera vez en la Primera División de Ecuador con la camiseta de Barcelona Sporting Club.\nMás noticias: Mena o Caicedo, ¿cuál llega en mejor forma? Ángel Mena jugó su último partido el miércoles 18 de diciembre de 2024 con el Pachuca de México , es decir, hasta este jueves son 28 días que está ‘inactivo’ y que no jugó un partido profesional de fútbol.\nSu último partido fue en la final del Mundial de Clubes ante el Real Madrid. Ingresó a los 75 minutos en lugar de Alán Bautista . En el tiempo de descuento marcó el 3-1, pero fue anulado por fuera de juego y el marcador final fue de 3-0 en el estadio Lusail.\nEl ‘Ángel del gol’ solo estuvo seis meses en el Pachuca, pero alcanzó los títulos FIFA Derbi de las Américas (derrotaron 3-0 a Botafogo , campeón de la Copa Libertadores) y del FIFA Copa Challenger (vencieron en penales al Al-Alhy de Egipto por 6-5).\nEn los últimos seis meses jugó 10 partidos, no anotó goles, no dio asistencias, recibió dos tarjetas amarillas y sumó 374 minutos. El entrenador uruguayo Guillermo Almada lo tuvo como una pieza de recambio.\nLa realidad de Felipe Caicedo es diametralmente opuesta. Su último encuentro fue el 31 de mayo de 2023 en la fecha 30 de la liga de Arabia Saudita, con lo que puso fin a su paso por ese torneo.\nEs decir, lleva 1 año, 7 meses, y 13 días o lo que equivale a 596 días sin pisar oficialmente un terreno de juego, si tomamos como referencia este jueves 16 de enero.\nEse fue el último de los 24 juegos que el guayaquileño disputó en Arabia Saudita . En su estancia anotó tres goles, la tercera producción mas baja en su carrera, luego de no haber anotado en el Inter de Milan, y de haber hecho solo uno en el Génova.\nBajo este panorama, Mena llega en mejor estado de forma que Caicedo. El tiempo y el correr de los partidos demostrará cuál de los dos es el mejor y más fructífero fichaje de la Liga Pro en la temporada que arrancará el viernes 14 de febrero.\n¿Mena opaca a Caicedo? Al margen de sí un fichaje opaca al otro, los seguidores de la Liga Pro ganan dos jugadores con los que el espectáculo en cada jornada está garantizado, tomando como base su fructífero pasado.\nMena ya ganó tres títulos del campeonato nacional con Emelec y seis más entre el Cruz Azul, León y Pachuca en México, mientras que Caicedo levantó trofeos con el Basel en Suiza y con la Lazio e Inter en Italia.\nAmbos jugaron con la Selección de Ecuador en amistosos, eliminatorias y en un Mundial, ‘Angelito’ en Catar 2022 y ‘Felipao’ en Brasil 2014 , además, anotaron goles con la camiseta tricolor.\nLa invitación está en la mesa y lista para ser abierta desde el viernes 14 de febrero, día en el que arrancará la séptima edición de la Liga Pro.\nÚltimos fichajes de la Liga Pro Jefferson Valverde – De Dynamo Houston a Orense\nMilton Maciel (Paraguay) – De Sportivo Trinidense a Universidad Católica\nCarlos Medina – De Libertad a Universidad Católica\nMateo Santos – Vinotinto del Ecuador (renovado)\nMathías Buitrón – Vinotinto del Ecuador (renovado)\nYerlin Quiñónez – De Deportivo Cuenca a Libertad\nRichard Borja – De Barcelona SC a Libertad\nFacundo Ospitaleche – De Rampla Juniors a Manta\nFranco Zicarelli – De Sportivo Italiano a Delfín\nMateo Levato – De Ferro Carril Oeste a Delfín\nConfesionario – segunda temporada en proceso",
