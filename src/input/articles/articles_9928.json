    "text": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to Russia this week provided an opportunity to review ongoing bilateral cooperation and examine ways to further bolster the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership, according to an official statement on Saturday. Jaishankar was in Russia from December 25 to 29 during which he called on President Vladimir Putin and held discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov. Jaishankar also held discussions with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. The External Affairs Minister (EAM) had a comprehensive exchange of views on bilateral cooperation in trade and economics, energy, defence, connectivity, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and cooperation between regions of the two countries. He also shared perspectives on global and regional developments including multilateral cooperation. Three documents relating to the Kudan Kulam Nuclear Power Plants, an MoU on cooperation in pharmaceuticals and healthcare and a Protocol on Foreign Office Consultations were signed during the visit. \"The EAM's visit to Russia provided an opportunity to review ongoing bilateral cooperation and consider ways to further strengthen the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries,\" the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. \"India-Russia relations have remained strong and steady building upon strategic convergences, geopolitical interests, and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,\" it said. During Jaishankar's meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on Wednesday, the Russian president invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Russia next year. \"We will be glad to see our friend, Mr. Prime Minister Modi in Russia,\" Putin told Jaishankar. So far, 21 annual summits have taken place alternatively in India and Russia. The last summit took place in New Delhi in December 2021. The ties between India and Russia remained strong notwithstanding Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it has been maintaining that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue. Jaishankar also interacted with Russian think tanks/academics and exchanged views on Indian foreign policy perspectives as well as Russia-India relations. The rich contribution of cultural ties and people-to-people exchanges in enhancing the goodwill and friendship between India and Russia was reflected in EAM's interaction with the Indian Diaspora in Moscow, the statement said. In Saint Petersburg, Jaishankar met the Governor, Alexander Beglov, and discussed possibilities of cooperation in the economic and cultural fields. He had a discussion with a diverse cross-section of Indologists at Saint Petersburg University. Views were exchanged on how to enhance a better direct understanding and appreciation of developments in the two countries. He also interacted with teachers and students at School No 653 named after Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, a premier Russian government school which teaches Hindi as part of its regular curriculum.",

    "text": "МОСКВА, 31 июл — РИА Новости. Систему для быстрой оценки потери крови с высокой точностью в машинах скорой помощи и реанимациях разработали ученые СибГМУ . Результаты исследования представлены на Международной научно-технической конференции молодых ученых и студентов к 105-летию Белорусского национального технического университета в Минске. Своевременное выявление кровопотери является критически важным для спасения жизни пациентов в условиях медицины катастроф, когда требуется быстрая оценка состояния пострадавших: при различных авариях, дорожно-транспортных происшествиях и стихийных бедствиях. Как рассказали ученые Сибирского государственного медицинского университета (СибГМУ), современные медицинские мониторы предоставляют информацию о физиологических показателях пациента в режиме реального времени, что позволяет врачам оценить состояние пациента. Однако качество оценки находится в сильнейшей зависимости от опыта и квалификации медицинского персонала. Специалисты вуза разработали алгоритм, который позволяет автоматизировать процесс оценки кровопотери и снизить роль человеческого фактора. Он направлен на создание модели киберфизической системы для контроля состояния пациентов в машинах бригад скорой медицинской помощи, а также в палатах интенсивной терапии. В основе разработки лежит моделирование геморрагического шока с использованием модифицированного симулятора физиологии человека Pulse Physiology Platform. В России создали компактный прибор для контроля состояния легких",

    "text": "By Zach Braziller ,\n1 hour ago\nNaomi Osaka’s return to the U.S. Open didn’t last long.\nTwo days after a stirring, straight-set upset over 10th-ranked Jelena Ostapenko , Osaka looked capable of hanging around awhile in Flushing.\nInstead, she bowed out on Thursday night in disappointing fashion, and Osaka only had herself to blame.\nThis wasn’t a case of necessarily losing to a superior player.\nNaomi Osaka serves up another bow-inspired outfit at US Open\nOsaka beat herself after playing mostly mistake-free tennis in the brilliant opening-round performance.\nNaomi Osaka fell in her second-round match at the U.S. Open. Jason Szenes for New York Post Osaka committed 21 unforced errors in a 6-3, 7-6 (5) loss to unseeded Czech Karolina Muchova under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nJessica Pegula echoes frustrations over internet trolls: ‘Totally normal for us’\nKarolina Muchova is moving on to the third round at the U.S. Open. Jason Szenes for New York Post In her first U.S. Open since 2022 — Osaka took time off to give birth to a baby girl — she was too mistake-prone.\nOf her 21 errors, 17 came in the second set, and she added four double faults.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER\nThe game that turned the match came right after her one and only break of Muchova, which gave her a 5-4 lead in the second set.\nKarolina Muchova celebrates her win over Naomi Osaka. Jason Szenes for New York Post Naomi Osaka and Karolina Muchova shake hands after their second-round U.S. Open match. Jason Szenes for New York Post But a series of miscues enabled Muchova — a semifinalist at the U.S. Open last summer who has seen her ranking plummet to 52nd in the world — to break back.\nAnd in the tiebreak, it was against Osaka being unable to complete points.\nShe had a key double fault when up 4-2 in the tiebreaker and facing match point, Osaka was unable to convert a forehand swinging volley at the net.\nFor the latest in sports, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/sports/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car",
    "text": "CINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "title": "El Papa denuncia las \"fake news\" y pide a los jóvenes salir de las \"identidades artificiales\"",
    "text": "ROMA, 25 May. (EUROPA PRESS) - El Papa ha denunciado las \"fake news\" y ha pedido a los jóvenes salir de las \"identidades artificiales\". \"En una sociedad contaminada por las fake news, donde los perfiles personales son a menudo alterados o falsos, donde se crean identidades alternativas, el discernimiento quiere ser para los jóvenes un camino de autenticidad: salir de las identidades artificiales y descubrir su verdadera identidad\", ha señalado Francisco. El Pontífice ha hecho estas declaraciones en su discurso a los participantes en el Congreso Internacional de Pastoral Juvenil promovido por el Dicasterio para los Laicos, la Familia y la Vida sobre el tema: \"Por una pastoral juvenil sinodal: nuevos estilos y estrategias de liderazgo\", que se clausura este sábado en Roma. \" El Papa ha instado de este modo a los jóvenes a trata de llegar \"a ser auténticos ante uno mismo, ante los demás y ante Dios\". \"Nos reímos cuando vemos que las mujeres se maquillan, tienen que estar guapas, para eso se maquillan, pero ¿cuántas veces todos nos 'maquillamos' el alma para aparentar lo que no somos?\", ha dicho. A su juicio ,es importante que la sociedad escuche a a los jóvenes. \"Una escucha real, que no se quede a medias, o sólo en una fachada. Los jóvenes no deben ser instrumentalizados para poner en práctica ideas ya decididas por otros o que no responden realmente a sus necesidades. No. Hay que responsabilizar a los jóvenes, implicarlos en el diálogo, en la planificación de actividades, en las decisiones. Debemos hacerles sentir que son parte activa y plena de la vida de la Iglesia; y sobre todo que ellos mismos son los primeros anunciadores del Evangelio a sus coetáneos\", ha señalado. Del mismo modo, ha asegurado que el discernimiento es \"un arte que deben aprender en primer lugar los agentes pastorales: sacerdotes y religiosos, catequistas, acompañantes, los propios jóvenes que siguen a otros jóvenes\". Para el Papa, es un arte que no se improvisa, \"que hay que profundizar, experimentar y vivir\". \"Para un joven, encontrar a una persona capaz de discernir es encontrar un tesoro. En el camino de la fe y en el descubrimiento de la propia vocación, un guía sabio ayuda a evitar tantos errores, tantas ingenuidades, tantos momentos de desconcierto y de parálisis\", ha señalado. El Pontífice ha lamentado que hoy \"prevalece el individualismo\". \"Cada uno sigue su propio camino, cada uno atribuye sentido a la vida, cada uno establece sus propios valores, sus propias verdades\", ha argumentado.",

    "text": "A Mom Suggests That Her Brother Sleep In A Camper On Their Family Vacation So Her Toddler Has A Room To Herself It doesn't seem right to force someone to sleep in a camper. Family vacations can be fun, but can also be full of family drama. This was true for one family whose sleeping arrangements threatened to ruin their entire vacation. One mom thought her brother and his partner should give up their room so her toddler could sleep there. A man [took to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/comments/1ebdwy5/not_oop_aita_for_ditching_a_planned_family/) to discuss the issue he had with his sister and her family. The drama was related to the family vacations they take every year. “My … mom … has a little lake house in the middle of the forest about six hours from our home city,” he explained. M.Pakats | Shutterstock Recently, the family had cause to celebrate. “Three years ago, my sister and [brother-in-law] had my niece, so [we resurrected family vacations](https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/child-psychologist-explains-sweet-reasons-kids-love-vacationing-their-parents), and they have been something we’ve all looked forward to for the past three years,” he said. “The sleeping situation had been as follows,” he continued. “My sister, [brother-in-law] and niece in the larger bedroom, my partner of 20 years and I in the little bedroom with bunk beds and my mom on the pull-out in the living room.” Recently, his sister repeatedly mentioned the need for more space. It turned out that was because she was pregnant with her second child. Now, as they plan to take their first family vacation with two nieces instead of one, his sister suggested some changes. altafulla | Shutterstock “Yesterday, I get a text from Mom saying, ‘You can sleep in [neighbor lady I don’t know]’s camper or the pull-out couch in the living room. [Three-year-old niece] needs the bottom bunk so [four-month-old niece] doesn’t wake her up throughout the night.\" \"Obviously, the camper was offered, so you won’t have to be cramped and have to get up early on vacation with little ones. I always offer our house to the neighbors for company comfort,’” he wrote. The man has not taken to this idea very well. “Don’t get me wrong, I love my nieces, but I’d be lying if I said I’m not feeling some type of way about all of this,” he shared. “I get that it would be easier for my sister and her family if they had all the bedrooms, but I don’t think it’s fair that 25 pounds of little girl gets two beds and a private room while two adults are exiled to the neighbor’s camper or three adults [are] crammed into an already cramped common area of the house.” Sevastsyanau Uladzimir | Shutterstock Now, the man and his partner are considering other options they may have beyond the family vacation. “Now I’m feeling like I’ll be resentful the whole time if my niece gets the room, or my sister and [brother-in-law] will be all pissy if their kids can’t sleep and we’re in their usual room,” he said. “I suggested to my partner that [we ask them to watch our dogs](https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/dog-mom-shares-long-list-instructions-gives-dog-sitter), and we can schedule a last-minute trip to Vegas and the Grand Canyon (we’ve been talking about it since COVID) with our time off from work.” If it’s too difficult for someone to go on vacation, they don’t have to. [Katherine Goldstein wrote for the parenting newsletter The Double Shift](https://www.thedoubleshift.com/the-case-against-family-vacations/) about how hard it can be to travel with young children. “I am here today to give you loving permission to not [travel with your small children](https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/mom-believes-family-should-board-deplane-first),” Goldstein said. [Uncle Furious After Rich People Offer To Send The Nephew He's Raising To Summer Camp—'My Finances Are None Of Your Business'](/family/uncle-furious-rich-people-offered-pay-nephews-camp?utm_medium=amp-mid-recent-block) “Maybe the unique burdens of having twins have made us succumb to this absolutist stance, but it’s also allowed me to step back and question why traveling with young children has become such an unchallenged norm in middle-class and above social circles,” she continued. In Goldstein’s opinion, it might actually be easier to travel without children, something this man’s sister could take note of. But, even if she chooses to still go on the family vacations, her brother certainly doesn’t have to. If he feels he will be uncomfortable in any way, he’s better off doing something else.
