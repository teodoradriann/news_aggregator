    "text": "Peggiorano le condizioni di Papa Francesco . Il Pontefice ha avuto una “crisi respiratoria” di “entità più prolungata nel tempo”, è stato necessaria “la somministrazione di emotrasfusioni” la “prognosi è riservata”. Lo rende noto il bollettino medico diffuso dalla sala stampa della Santa Sede .\n“Condizioni critiche” “Le condizioni del Santo Padre continuano ad essere critiche, pertanto, come spiegato ieri, il Papa non è fuori pericolo. Questa mattina Papa Francesco ha presentato una crisi respiratoria asmatiforme di entità prolungata nel tempo, che ha richiesto anche l’applicazione di ossigeno ad alti flussi.\nGli esami del sangue odierni hanno inoltre evidenziato una piastrinopenia, associata ad un’anemia, che ha richiesto la somministrazione di emotrasfusioni. Il Santo Padre continua ad essere vigile e ha trascorso la giornata in poltrona anche se più sofferente rispetto a ieri. Al momento la prognosi è riservata”.\nNiente Angelus dal Gemelli\nEra già stato comunicato che illPapa, come già è accaduto domenica scorsa, non guiderà l’Angelus dal Gemelli. Sarà però diffuso il testo preparato dal Papa esattamente come accaduto la scorsa settimana, fa sapere la Sala stampa del Vaticano.\nBergoglio, che rispetta così l'”assoluto riposo” prescritto dai medici, ha nuovamente deciso di fare pubblicare il testo che avrebbe pronunciato in occasione della preghiera mariana dimostrando di non volersi fermare comunque del tutto. Anche domenica scorsa nel testo inviato aveva ringraziato i fedeli di tutto il mondo per le preghiere e i medici, con un nuovo accorato appello per la pace nel mondo.\nPapa Francesco ha preparato anche il testo dell’omelia per la messa di domani in occasione del Giubileo dei diaconi che sarà presieduta da monsignor Rino Fisichella alle 9 nella Basilica di San Pietro.\nI rischi\n“Il Papa sa di essere in pericolo. Può capitare che questi germi, che oggi sono nelle vie respiratorie e nei polmoni, malauguratamente passasse nel sangue, avrebbe una sepsi. E una sepsi, con la sua età e con la sua condizione, sarebbe difficile da… il vero richio, in questi casi, è che i germi passino nel sangue. Il rischio è quello di una sepsi”, aveva detto ieri il professore Sergio Alfieri in un briefing al Gemelli sulla salute del Papa .m",

    "text": "Doris H. McKellar\nPublished 4:46 pm Thursday, December 28, 2023\nJACKSON, NC – Mrs. Doris Hurley McKellar, 99, of Jackson, passed away on December 22, 2023.\nMrs. McKellar was born January 21, 1924 in Milton, NC, the daughter of the Rev. John Bascom Hurley and Daisy Fuqua Hurley. She grew up in a Methodist household, was a fine athlete in school, and graduated from Seaboard High School, and later she attended Greensboro College and, of all places, Duke University.\nShe was predeceased by her parents; her husbands, Matt W. Ransom III in 1944, and Angus A. McKellar in 1972; and also her four siblings, Nita, Bascom, Billy and Darel.\nDoris was survived by her sons, Matt Ransom IV (Alice) of Little River, SC, John McKellar (Nan) of Jackson, and Benjie McKellar (Caroline) of Chapel Hill. She is also survived by five grandchildren and nine great-grands.\nGraveside services will be held in Rowland, NC at a later date.\nWhile the last few years have been difficult, she lived a long and healthy life, and she took good care of herself. A homemaker, she enjoyed playing bridge with her buddies, listening to Frank Sinatra, and walking the sidewalks of Jackson in her purple tennis shoes. Her favorite activity was shopping for clothes —- and she was good at it! Her grandchildren called her “Mama Doris”.\nMay she rest in peace.\nArrangements are being handled by Askew Funeral and Cremation Services – Jackson Chapel.",

    "text": "Republicans in the Georgia Senate have turned a new page in the culture war over books.\nNearly two dozen of them, including several high-ranking members, have signed onto legislation that seeks to ban government funding for libraries affiliated with the American Library Association, which they claim is influenced by Marxist ideology.\nSenate Bill 390 , introduced Wednesday, would deny ALA-affiliated libraries any taxpayer funding from Georgia’s cities, counties, public schools, the state University System and other public bodies created under the state Constitution or laws.\nIt’s the latest GOP measure to take aim at books and culture issues, after legislation in past years that limited classroom discussions about race, participation by transgender athletes and the types of books allowed in school libraries. A Cobb County teacher was fired last year after reading a book to her fifth grade students that challenges gender norms.\nRepublican senators last year also introduced legislation that would strip criminal legal protection from school librarians who let students check out books found to be obscene.\nThe lead sponsor of SB 390 is Sen. Larry Walker III , R-Perry, the majority caucus secretary of the Senate. Several other high-ranking Republican senators, including President Pro Tem John F. Kennedy , Majority Leader Steve Gooch , Majority Caucus Chair Jason Anavitarte and Vice Chair Matt Brass , signed onto the bill.\nPlease return for updates.\nAbout the Author\nTy Tagami Ty Tagami is the state education reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

    "text": "Have you heard of the 3D reboot? Do you know which stock market is “wildly cheap”? Does a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio play an important role in your stock selection strategy? If you’ve decided to take a hard look at your portfolio in the new year, these are the themes that will determine the direction of the markets in 2024. There may be more encouraging news on inflation and interest rates. But some analysts argue that economies have not yet felt the full impact of higher borrowing costs imposed in 2023, meaning recession may still be a threat in Britain and the United States. In this context, it can be tempting to wait for the all-clear signal. But, as Rathbones’ James Thomson points out, “that will never come, and often the best results come when you least expect them.” If you believe that fortune favors the brave, these are the topics you can’t afford to ignore in 2024. Bargain in Britain: The FTSE All Share index is up just 1.7% in the last 12 months, but many experts say UK shares are currently undervalued. The 3D reboot Alex Tedder and Tom Wilson, global and emerging strategists at Schroders, say investors should be aware of what they call the “3D reset,” which will increasingly influence the mood of stock markets. This is made up of three factors: demographic limitations; decarbonization imperatives and deglobalization initiatives. These have created supply bottlenecks, raised wage costs, driven inflation and propped up populism. Faced with these challenges, investors would do well to change their thinking and focus more on diversification in particular, rather than relying on the US technology that dominates many portfolios. Tedder and Wilson do not suggest saying goodbye to the United States in 2024, since “its business sector remains, on the whole, better managed and more innovative than virtually any other.” But they do recommend that you explore markets you don’t like, such as Japan and the United Kingdom. Diversification is difficult, but AJ Bell’s Russ Mold says paying attention to certain themes can help you determine “which way the wind is blowing” and realign your portfolio. Debt/GDP ratio In 2024, analysts, as always, will carefully monitor oil and copper prices, “a reliable indicator of global economic health due to its multiple uses.” But they will also closely monitor an increasingly important metric: a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio. If this proportion approaches 20 percent, this should serve as a warning. China and France are already in this position, but the United States’ trillion-dollar-a-year spending is putting them in the danger zone. US markets are pricing in five rate cuts in 2024. Mold argues that if these cuts fail to materialise, this could jeopardize the combined $11.8 trillion market capitalization of the Magnificent Seven. Government Bond Yield Curve Mold also cites another key issue: the government bond yield curve, which reflects market sentiment about risk. The yield curve is “inverted”, meaning the yields on ten-year UK shares and US bonds are lower than those on two-year bonds. The opposite should be true for longer-term bonds that offer a higher yield, as compensation for the possibility of a catastrophe occurring at some point during their longer lifespan. Have you never bet against the United States? Investment legend: Warren Buffett US markets have flourished in 2023, ending the year in style, with all three major indices (the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq) rising for seven consecutive weeks. Driving stock prices has been the hope that interest rates will fall in 2024. There are also hopes that the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will continue to prosper as the artificial intelligence boom continues to gain steam. But UBS analysts also bet on Boeing, Coca-Cola, Domino’s Pizza, Merck, Visa and Ulta Beauty, since they believe that the search for beauty is an every year theme. Another persistent theme is never betting against the United States, something that has sustained billionaire Warren Buffett (pictured) for more than six decades. Salary agreements Mold suggests that we must be attentive to wage agreements, given their impact on inflation. The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates early in the new year, following the surprise drop in the inflation rate to 3.9 percent. But the Bank does not appear willing to take action until wage increases are moderate. These issues mean that you will hear many analysts speak of a “lack of certainty.” But this is likely to raise the profile of what Thomson calls “recession-resistant stocks that can survive any economic cycle.” It includes in this category companies as diverse as discount retailer Costco, with its loyal and growing customer base, and Hermes, maker of exclusive handbags. Diversification means accepting the high and the low. Great Britain Offer Experts are declaring that the UK is the place to invest in 2024. This claim will be met with some cynicism by those who backed Britain in 2023 and were sorely disappointed. The FTSE All Share Index has risen just 1.7 per cent over the past 12 months, which looks decidedly lackluster compared to the 24.6 per cent rise of the irrepressible S&P 500. But there remains a belief that the UK is “wildly cheap”, according to Matthew Bennison of the Schroder Income Growth fund. It is increasing its British holdings, believing they will do well over a three-year horizon. Simon Gergel, manager of the Merchants investment fund, also argues that Britain is a bargain, saying investors pay £10 for every pound of profits in the UK, compared with $20 for every dollar of profits in the United States. The belief that British companies are being offered at a discount is behind the continuing wave of foreign takeovers of British companies. Last month, the powerful Mars corporation swallowed Hotel Chocolat, maker of the Sleekster and other delicacies, in a £524 million deal. News of the acquisition sent Hotel Chocolat shares soaring 160 percent. This underscores the gap between our perception of our local businesses and the view in some quarters of Wall Street that they are the equivalent of a box of Sleekster chocolate at the price of a selection of Milk Tray. However, Pimco, the biggest US name in corporate bonds, is betting that the UK is heading for a hard landing brought on by a delayed consumer reaction to higher interest rates. And anxiety over the Brexit outcome is behind the undervaluation of UK shares. Some will still conclude that the UK is cheap for some reason. But this could be short-sighted when analysts at US brokerage Jefferies consider Prudential and Standard Chartered as the stocks to watch in 2024, predicting they could grow 105 per cent and 70 per cent respectively. The mold is tilting pharma giant GSK (for the cautious), Legal & General (a balanced pick), equipment supplier Ashmore (a more adventurous pick) and insurance broker Lancashire (for income).

Dicha iniciativa busca implementar jornadas de 12 horas diarias para casos excepcionales.\nEl centro de educación superior argumenta que se plantean riesgos para los derechos laborales y la calidad de vida de los trabajadores en el país.\nEntre las principales implicaciones analizadas destacan:\n- Aumento de horas laboradas: Se estima un incremento promedio de 191 horas anuales, equivalentes a 15.9 días laborales adicionales, alejando aún más a Costa Rica de los estándares de países de la OCDE.\n- Eliminación de horas extraordinarias: Esta medida reduciría los ingresos de miles de personas trabajadoras que dependen de estos pagos para completar su salario mensual y calcular aguinaldos.\n- Impacto desproporcionado en mujeres trabajadoras: La reconfiguración de horarios podría incrementar su carga de trabajo no remunerado, afectando su salud y limitando su tiempo de cuidado personal.\n- Riesgo para la salud física y mental: Jornadas prolongadas afectan la calidad de vida, aumentan el estrés y generan mayor riesgo de agotamiento y problemas de salud.\n- Desbalance de poder laboral: Beneficios como el servicio de cuido para menores serían opcionales y sujetos al “mutuo acuerdo” con empleadores, perpetuando desigualdades estructurales.\nLa UNED tomó esta posición luego de que la Comisión Permanente de Asuntos Jurídicos de la Asamblea Legislativa, remitiera en consulta el texto de dicho expediente y fuera estudiado por distintas áreas de la academia.\nLa universidad concluyó que esta propuesta “amenaza principios fundamentales garantizados por la Constitución Política“, como la duración de las jornadas ordinarias y el derecho al pago de horas extraordinarias.\nEl rector de la UNED, Rodrigo Arias Camacho, dio a conocer su preocupación ante las implicaciones de esta reforma, “nos oponemos a cualquier reforma que comprometa el bienestar integral de las personas trabajadoras”.\nEn el análisis realizado por la UNED participaron: Asesora Jurídica del Consejo Universitario, el Centro de Investigación en Cultura y Desarrollo (CICDE), el Instituto de Estudios de Género, la Oficina de Recursos Humanos y el Laboratorio de Innovación Jurídica.",

Increased security likely; traffic disruptions possible.\nAmazon workers will stage strikes and protests in multiple European countries from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2. The employees are denouncing low pay and lack of labor union representation on \"Black Friday\" and \"Cyber Monday,\" which fall on Nov. 29 and Dec. 2, respectively. Local and regional labor unions and activist groups, including UNI Global Union and Progressive International, support the action. While most actions will feature dozens to hundreds of activists, gatherings in some major cities, including London, UK, and Berlin, Germany, could feature thousands of participants. Protests are likely outside Amazon offices, warehouses, and distribution centers.\nLocal authorities will likely deploy increased security to all protest sites. Localized road travel disruptions are possible in affected areas. Violence is not anticipated. Logistics disruptions are likely for deliveries of Amazon products.\nAvoid the demonstrations as a routine security precaution and to mitigate associated disruptions. Heed instructions from authorities. Check for disruptions and allow extra time to reach destinations.",

    "text": "Los últimos días del año llegaron con un clima bastante inusual para la temporada veraniega, la cual se ha visto plagada de lluvias y repentinos cambios de temperatura. Una vez más, el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) lanzó una nueva alerta respecto a esto y dio a conocer que se esperan [ tormentas severas ](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/clima/alerta-meteorologica-nivel-amarillo-por-tormentas-severas-y-fuertes-vientos-a-que-hora-se-larga/)en cierto sector del país. Alerta meteorológica nivel amarillo por temperaturas extremas: qué zonas sufrirán la ola de calor y hasta cuándo Luego del temporal que azotó gran parte de la provincia bonaerense, el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) lanzó una alerta amarilla que trae preocupación a los ciudadanos. En esta oportunidad, los fenómenos meteorológicos que se harán presente en algunas provincias del país son [ tormentas severas](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/clima/alerta-meteorologica-nivel-amarillo-por-tormentas-y-caida-de-granizo-que-zonas-estan-en-peligro-y-cuando-mejora/) y la caída de granizo. En ese sentido, la alerta amarilla se encuentra dirigida para las localidades cordobesas de Santa Rosa de Calamuchita, San Alberto, San Javier y Santa María. Pero no solo en ese sector, sino también en la provincia de San Juan, específicamente en Chacabuco, Junín y Libertador General San Martin. Ese sentido, la alerta amarilla regirá no solo para las últimas horas del jueves 28 de diciembre, sino también para el inicio del viernes 29. Qué significa la alerta amarilla por tormentas severas De acuerdo con la entidad encargada del clima a nivel nacional, la alerta amarilla corresponde a “posibles fenómenos meteorológicos con capacidad de daño y riesgo de interrupción momentánea de actividades cotidianas”. En caso de que dicha alerta sea por tormentas severas, el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional da una serie de recomendaciones para que los ciudadanos tomen precauciones. En ese sentido, la entidad no solo recomienda alejarse de los árboles y evitar salir, sino también evitar estacionar el auto cerca de posibles plantaciones o construcciones que podrían derrumbarse. Otra de las tantas recomendaciones que da la entidad meteorológica es mantener los hogares cerrados, informarse por autoridades y, además, tener una mochila lista en caso de emergencias con la documentación necesaria y los números importantes en caso de cualquier eventualidad inesperada.",

Seguro que es capaz de decir que esos niños han sido vendidos y no puede pedirse su devolución o algo similar.\n[#6](c6#c-6) [#42](c42#c-42) [#46](c46#c-46)\nEn serio, por qué perdéis el tiempo con esta gente? Bloqueo y a vivir. Están aquí para joder, nada más.\nNo os llega con Ana Rosa, la Griso, Ferreras, Losantos, Herrera, ABC, El Mundo, etc? Aquí tenéis la oportunidad de taparles la boca a esta gentecilla que a saber por qué están aquí diciendo estas chorradas\n\"Según la organización pro derechos humanos Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, cerca de 500 bebés fueron robados por la dictadura a sus progenitores, en su mayoría opositores al régimen. En muchos casos, sostiene la organización, las madres que dieron a luz en centros clandestinos de detención y tortura, fueron desaparecidas para siempre, asesinadas o tiradas con vida al mar.\"\nengendros del averno\n[#52](c52#c-52) uff el cansino ese del mensaje kilométrico?\nEse también está entre mis excepciones, igual que el que repetía le mensaje en cada noticia del bitcoin.\nPero es que yo los insultos del calibre de este usuario es que debería estar baneado por el resto del los días.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Pero aún no tienes a ese ente en el ignore? si de cada 10 palabras 20 son insultos...\nLuego preguntan porqué meneame se va al garete..\n[#48](c48#c-48) No uso mucho el ignore, solo tengo a un usuario, el que no quiere hacer crecer a sus hijos en la miseria...\n[#27](c27#c-27) La cuestión es si es necesario un organismo solo para eso o puede derivarse a otro ya existente.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Vaya, qué sorpresa, uno de los seres con mayor nivel de miseria de esta web, y mira que el nivel es alto, alegrándose de que no puedan investigarse los secuestros de niños en una dictadura. Por lo que sea, eh?\nPues ya solo con el banco genético que ha creado ya tiene mayor utilidad que la que puedan tener 10000 seres como tú en 10000 vidas.\n[#31](c31#c-31) ¿Quién se ha alegrado de nada?\nResultados, hay un estudio genético, ok, ¿Cuales son los resultados?\nTu si que eres miserable...\nEl gobierno dice que el organismo actuaba \"por iniciativa propia, para la individualización de los responsables de posibles hechos criminales\"\nA los que defienden la libertad no les gusta que los organismos sean independientes, sobre todo estos organismos que TIENEN LA OBLIGACION de ser independientes de cualquier gobierno o ideología política.\nEspero que alguien viole la LOPD y ponga esos archivos a salvo\n[#56](c56#c-56) Si tienes empatía, dona a una ONG o asociación que realice esa tarea. Que yo no quiera que esto sea financiado coercitivamente/via impuestos no significa en absoluto que esté en contra de que se realice la tarea, de forma privada.\nLa empatía, con el dinero propio, no con el ajeno.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Es lo que sospecho, se centran en el número de niños robados, los que reconocen ciertos organismos y los que reconoce el gobierno, pero ¿y los logros de este organismo? ¿cuál es la justificación del gasto? ¿Hay que soltar billetes aunque no haya resultados?\n[#4](c4#c-4) Ni de ti me esperaba defender semejante indignidad. Tiempo suficiente es todo el necesario para la resolución de todos los casos de un crimen tan atroz como es robar seres humanos. Y son cientos.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Semejante personaje despreciable. Como si fuera una \"investigación\" que tarda un tiempo concreto. Es un organismo que se encarga de hacer pruebas de ADN a la población para buscar familiares cercanos de gente que en la mayoría de los casos es por sospecha que puede ser un niño robado o los familiares terminan confesando...\nNo se puede caer más bajo que defender algo así.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No sé cómo te aguantas y llamas simplemente «indigno» a un saco de mierda así. En serio, todo mi respeto a tu templanza\n[#4](c4#c-4) Han tenido 20 años para investigar eso\nEso no es completamente cierto. En el artículo dicen claramente que fue fundada en el 92. No han tenido 20 años, han tenido 30.\nY teniendo en cuenta que 10 años antes ya estaba la Comisión Nacional por la Desaparición de Personas que hacía lo mismo y cuyas funciones luego asumió el organismo que ha cerrado Milei, en realidad han tenido 40 años.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Hace 40 años no habia la capacidad de hacer tests genéticos en cantidad, disponibilidad y coste como la que hay ahora.\n[#38](c38#c-38) Las pruebas genéticas para investigar la filiación con personas desaparecidas las lleva el Banco Nacional de Datos Genéticos y son gratuitas. Para quien tiene sospechas de ser hijo/a de algún desaparecido, quien realmente resuelve el tema es está organización, a la que cualquiera puede acudir y que además lo hace de forma gratuita. No necesitas añadir una capa de burocracia adicional en forma de otra organización.\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Nacional_de_Datos_Genéticos\n[#4](c4#c-4) Te voy a poner un ejemplo: España\nAquí hemos tenido 50 años (y contando) y todavía hay un montón de barbaridades que se hicieron en la dictadura de Franco que siguen sin saberse.\nY eso es así porque todavía hay gente viva y con poder, interesada en que no se sepa.\nY en Argentina, igual. Y esa gente con poder ha votado a Milei para que parara esas investigaciones, no sea que se descubra que algún heredero de una familia de bien resulta que tiene genes de rojo piojoso.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Precisamente. Este es de los que dice que no hay que reabrir heridas del pasado obviando que los delitos de lesa humanidad no prescriben\n[#50](c50#c-50) Viniendo del tío que llama fascistas a los que piden acabar con los difusores de fake news racistas, en realidad tu opinión respecto a esto se podía intuir. Has confirmado lo que pareces esmerarte en demostrar cada día; das asco. No eres más que otro ultra conservador sin escrúpulos, como tu máximo héroe, el sociópata Milei.",
