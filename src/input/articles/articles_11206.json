    "text": "TEGUCIGALPA, 20 FEB - Per la prima volta nella recente storia del Nicaragua le chiese, indipendentemente dalla loro denominazione, hanno iniziato a pagare le tasse sulle offerte e sulle elemosine che ricevono, come conseguenza della riforma della legge di Concertazione fiscale. Secondo il sito del quotidiano nicaraguense indipendente La Prensa, nelle dichiarazioni dei redditi che si fanno in questi giorni nel paese centroamericano tutte le associazioni religiose sono state elevate al regime generale e stanno pagando le tasse in questo momento con aliquote fino al 30% sul reddito, la maggior parte del quale è ricavato da offerte ed elemosine. \"E nessuno parla per paura\", ha spiegato una delle fonti citate da La Prensa. Il 21 agosto dello scorso anno il presidente de facto del Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, aveva ordinato l'eliminazione delle esenzioni per le chiese di qualsiasi confessione in un pacchetto di riforme che ha creato un nuovo modello per le organizzazioni non profit e ha colto l'occasione per apportare modifiche alla legge 822, quella di Concertazione fiscale..",

Cada año cambiaban de carro y hacían cruceros por Europa y El Caribe. Con Yates propios y apartamentos en Miami y en España. Cada día los Antimaduristas amanecen maldiciendo a Chávez y a Maduro, porque se les acabó la manguanga, como dicen los cubanos y ahora son los Maduristas quienes tienen esos privilegios, que, según ellos, no deben disfrutarlos.\nSi alguno de mis lectores o lectoras, tiene alguna duda de lo que hasta aquí ha leído, revise el contenido de lo publicado esta semana en la página web de Aporrea y se encontrará con cada loco, que hasta dan pena.

    "title": "Audacity, ambition and unity at the Paris 2024 Games | The Indian Express",
    "text": "The Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games 2024 ended a few days ago. The Games were not just an occasion to witness records breaking, including the remarkable achievements of the Indian para-athletes’ delegation. They will also be remembered in history as one of the most inclusive, diverse and sustainable sports events. From the opening ceremony on the Seine, the first ever to be held beyond the walls of a stadium, to the last parade, which took place on September 14, the Paris 2024 Games gathered, physically and virtually, hundreds of millions of sports fans. Athletes and para-athletes have made history in iconic venues in France such as the Eiffel Tower and the Grand Palais in Paris, the Palace of Versailles, as well as in the French overseas territories. Throughout this sporting extravaganza, some remarkable moments will be remembered: The triumphant comeback of Simone Biles in women’s gymnastics, the new world record of Armand Duplantis in men’s pole vault, French swimming superstar Léon Marchand’s four gold medals, or Harvinder Singh’s gold medal in men’s para archery — the first ever for India in this sport. The Paris 2024 Games were watched by almost a billion people across the world, including in India where the Alliances Françaises network had deployed “fan zones” across the country. The Games were an “unprecedented success” with over 12 million tickets sold, surpassing the previous record set in London 2012. Over a million people thronged the streets of Paris to witness the bike race, and millions more gathered in free “fan zones” across the country. Nonetheless, the greatest success of these Games extends beyond the field of sports. In spite of the best tally of medals that French athletes and para-athletes have ever won, the legacy of Paris 2024 will lie, above all, in its contribution to a more diverse, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable society. The Games have been a great catalyst for adapting society to persons with disabilities. One thousand seven hundred and fifty “inclusive clubs” were created in France before the Games to develop para sports and to train more para-athletes — the objective is to create 3,000 of these clubs by the end of 2025. The Games have also been an occasion to invest in the accessibility of the main sport facilities as well as to take concrete measures to facilitate the mobility of spectators with disabilities: Hundred per cent of the bus and tram networks in Paris were made wheelchair-friendly, the national railway company and the main airports doubled the number of available wheelchairs, 1,000 taxis were made available, among other measures. The Games have also shown that sport has a much broader role to play in our society — to foster unity and encourage people to better accept differences. For instance, Paris 2024 was marked by a picture of North and South Korean athletes standing together, as well as by the words of the Indian para-athlete Sheetal Devi after her incredible comeback to win a bronze medal: “When I started playing, no one knew me. Now the entire world knows me — they know who Sheetal Devi is, and I am proud of that.” These images, these words, will definitely leave a mark on our society. The role of sports in strengthening health and preventing illnesses has also been put forward. The Games have been an occasion to further develop sports in French schools (30 minutes of sports have been added to the daily programme of elementary schools), as well as to reach new publics with “sports dating” everywhere in France, along with swimming projects and investment programmes throughout the country. Sustainability has been a key priority during the Games and will remain one of their main legacies. Paris 2024 will create a long lasting heritage in our cities. Two thousand French companies have been involved in the Games to ensure sustainability. Four thousand apartments in La Seine-Saint-Denis will be turned into a new neighbourhood and the new Olympic aquatic centre, built in the north of Paris, will be turned into a green park for the public. The Games will accelerate the eco-transition of many facilities and places: The cleaning of the Seine will probably be remembered as one of the most relevant examples. The Paris 2024 Committee worked tirelessly over years, with one of the smallest budgets ever for such an event (€4.4 billion, of which 95 per cent came from private funding) to achieve this great success. The Paris 2024 Olympics also made history by achieving gender parity on the field of play, ensuring equal representation of male and female athletes. Overall, these Games have been a display of audacity, ambition and unity and France is convinced that India will show the same qualities in its bid to host the 2036 Games. As President Macron underlined in a recent interview, we are willing to share our experience of hosting the Games as we strongly believe in the future of India. France is ready to transfer knowhow, in particular by exchanging expertise regarding the organisation of major international sporting events, as well as to encourage the participation of French companies to support India’s candidacy. In this context, joint work has already started: India helped France by sending a canine squad for security purposes. Indian officials, including Sports Secretary Sujata Chaturvedi, were welcomed in Paris during the Games to meet French experts, and a bilateral working group on sports cooperation will soon be launched to boost exchanges and links between economic and institutional actors. “Faster, Higher, Stronger” is the motto of the Olympics and Paralympics. This is also the spirit of the partnership between our two nations. In sports, as in many other areas, the Indo-French ability to partner and innovate together will allow us to set new records.

    "text": "TYLER, Texas (KLTV) - Mental and behavioral health are getting the spotlight in East Texas. On May 6, hundreds will gather for an annual summit, complete with workshops and keynote speakers. It’s all in the interest of making connections, finding support and learning.\nIncoming CEO of the Andrews Center Becki Mangum said they had around 50 tables representing agencies and resources last year, and over 90 this year.\n“We had the idea last year, and it wound up successful beyond our wildest dreams with the number of people that attended and the feedback that we got,” Mangum said. “We had originally thought, ‘Maybe we’ll just do this one-time thing, a push,’ but so many people enjoyed it and gave us the feedback like, ‘Please, you’ve got to do it again next year.’ So, that’s where we were. It was such a great opportunity to reach out to the community and educate about mental health and provide resources.”\nShe said Texas is known to struggle when it comes to addressing mental health, with a ranking varying from 49 to 51 relative to the other states and Washington D.C., including troubling levels of suicide. And East Texas has a rate that’s even higher than the state average, Mangum said.\n“We need to raise awareness, and so this event helps people understand what to look for, what resources are out there,” she said, explaining that a study released by the state placed Texas among the top 10 in the nation in terms of number of kids, but at the very bottom in terms of mental health care.\nBecki Mangum, incoming CEO of the Andrews Center, explains how mental and behavioral health are getting the spotlight in East Texas. Even though the topic is serious, Mangum said they have worked to make the event welcoming.\n“We’ve tried to make this a fun event, so when you come in, it’s a very welcoming environment,” she said. “There’ll be musicians playing. This year we actually expanded the hours so people could spend more time exploring the resources available. Those will be set up by noon, and we will have some food trucks there, so if people want to come on their lunch hour and find out some stuff about mental health and then grab lunch, they can do that. It’s just like a fun atmosphere – it’s not a gloomy atmosphere. It’s fun. When you come, you’ll enjoy it. It’s exciting and it’s full of hope.”\nThe event will also feature two keynote speakers who will share their stories and connections with mental health and mental health advocacy.\nOn a list that includes Washington D.C., Mental Health America ranks Texas 51st in access to mental health care.\nCopyright 2025 KLTV.

New book, Why Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Matter: Challenges and Solutions expounds on the idea that a set of diverse people provide a greater diversity of ideas that can help solve complex problems facing organizations in a competitive environment. Several chapters examine the effect of a lack of diversity in organizations (board diversity, partner diversity among auditors, etc.) on organizational outcomes. This research unveils a pivotal insight: diversity holds the potential to improve outcomes, but only under conditions fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas; otherwise, it risks devolving into dysfunction. Organizational effort needs to be directed to incentivizing diverse team members to share their ideas productively and meaningfully, to avoid dysfunctional polarization.\nSynopsis\nThe first chapter of this book delves into the implications of how merit is defined and its relevance in diverse contexts. Is individual merit intrinsically linked to job performance, or does it exist in isolation? Examining unequal practices, the initial chapters dissect the corrosive influence of pay gaps (Chapter 2), inequitable rewards for comparable performance (Chapter 1), implicit biases, faltering communications (Chapter 3), and disparate socializations (Chapter 4) on overall productivity. Far from merely highlighting problems, the chapters proffer evidence-backed solutions derived from academic research and the practical experiences of consultants, featuring insights from the Boston Consulting Group in Chapter 2 and a consultant-driven exploration in Chapter 3. These insights and actionable solutions could help organizations unlock the latent power of diversity within their teams. Academic researchers can use the insights to better identify areas where further research is needed. Team members need to feel included and incentivized to be engaged in the team’s decision-making to provide ideas. Chapter 9 examines the modification of management control systems to harness diversity, while Chapter 10 identifies the opportunities in the educational sector. Chapter 12 explores ways of improving effective communication among team members, while Chapter 13 deals with the effect of their social networking. The book concludes with two unique perspectives: reducing health inequity, and a personal case history of the author growing up in a traditional Chinese family.\nAbout the Book\nWhy Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Matter begins with a collection of chapters that identify customs and practices that are not conducive to promoting or utilizing diversity. Leopold, Bell, and Berry discuss meritocracy in Chapter 1. While “education level is widely believed to be an indicator of merit”, the authors explain how educational qualifications could be affected by factors unrelated to ability such as unequal opportunities and implicit biases. Using educational qualification as the primary yardstick of suitability to a job ignores the context and could result in an inefficient hire that leads to lower productivity. Srinidhi and Zhou (Chapter 2) provide further evidence on the reinforcing effect of unequal practices resulting in pay gaps, morale gaps, performance gaps, and evaluation gaps. In “Death by a Thousand Cuts”, Bol and Fogel-Yaari elucidate the cascading repercussions of implicit biases on career progression.\nThe subsequent chapters pivot to probing the ramifications of a dearth of diversity and proffer strategic insights on harnessing its benefits through the intentional design of boards and other organizational teams. For example, in Chapter 12, Fung and Cheung start off with identifying the problem of implementing board diversity thus: “Board diversity can be a double-edged sword: either amplifying board effectiveness through the optimal integration of skills from members with diverse backgrounds or dwarfing the normal board operations by creating conflicting factions”. The chapter offers pragmatic solutions centered around enabling effective inter-director communication to mitigate these challenges.\nThe book concludes with a personal case history. Tsui (Chapter 19) states “I narrate my story to illustrate how the social and cultural biases, absorbed by the family, the education system, and finally, the academic and corporate organizations, raise the bar for women at every stage, thwarting their progression. While I narrate this as a story of how they affected me as an individual, I also note that such inequity affects the overall productivity of society and the economy”. This interesting personal case history further confirms the concept of “Death by a Thousand Cuts” in Chapter 4 by Bol and Fogel-Yaari.\nThe book consists of 19 chapters written by over thirty authors ranging from PhD scholars to leading experts, researchers, practitioners, and consultants from US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, UK, India and UAE. “Why Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Matter: Challenges and Solutions integrates academic research with practical experiences from diverse international perspectives. It provides organizations useful tools for integrating a diverse workforce while harnessing the benefits of diversity. At the same time, it highlights some of the areas where academic researchers could provide more evidence-based insights to improve individual productivity, as well as organizational performance.\nRetail Information\nWhy Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Matter: Challenges and Solutions retails for US$168 / £155 (hardcover) and is also available in electronic formats.

    "text": "I n a week of baseball marred by fights between fans , one of MLB 's hottest rivalries between the New York Yankees and New York Mets spilled over into a massive brawl caught on film at Yankee Stadium . You can watch the viral video below, but we'd recommend using headphones.\nWatch the viral Yankees vs Mets fan brawl The intense footage, thought to be from after the Mets' 3-2 win on Tuesday night , originated from a now-deleted post on X, formerly Twitter .\nThe brawl added injury to insult for those on the Yankees side of the Subway Series divide. The Mets completed the season sweep of their cross-town rivals on Wednesday night when they finished the two-game set resounding 12-3 win over the Bronx Bombers .\nBitter defeat for New York Yankees Fans of both New York franchises were involved, starting with a pair of female fans wearing Yankees attire tussling with one another in the Yankee Stadium concourse. The melee grew larger when a male fan in a Yankees jersey attempted to push one of the women, which caused a fan in Mets attire to jump in and push him back.\nThe bitter rivals engaged in more back-and-forth pushing and shoving, as the Yankees fan removed his jersey while getting encouraged by the person recording the unsavory video. The bare-chested man landed a right hook to the Mets fan's face, dropping him to the floor.\nA different Yankees fan, wearing a gray Aaron Judge jersey, got involved while the camera panned back to show that the two women from the beginning were still grappling on the ground.\nSecurity did its best to intervene, but the lone officer had a thankless job, while onlookers continued to gas up the shirtless combatant who was eager to flex in front of the camera.\nSimilar scenes broke out earlier in the the week in the Los Angeles Dodgers crowd, setting a troubling trend of MLB fan fights that we hope will not continue.",

    "text": "01-18-2025 06:19 PM\nHi all i hope in posting this in the right area. I have had google nest 3 pack for 3 years now. Lately with lots of drop outs. At least 5 dropouts a week.

The actual issues is adding GOOGLE WIFI points models NLS-1304 to the mesh. They stuck at the end. The other google wifi point models AC-1304 do get added with out any issue so google home team need to check handshake between router and wifi point in the finalise step for this specific NLS-1304 model to understand the difference and fix it. Hope this helps to pin point the diagnosis and fix it the most annoying issue for lot of people. Else all these wifi points (Nls-1304) are just paper weights which google can use it in their offices.\nSaturday\nIt's pitiful. It used to be so easy in the old days. Now your waste hours, with recommendations like factory reset everything. Why? Your should be able just to add it easily. Unfortunately I have been with Google wifis for like ten years, but if I could I would switch to another company. Google has become so inefficient. Sorry to say but it's true.\na week ago\nupdate google home is available in iOS with the but the same problem still exists\nversion 3.32\nSaturday\nI have tried all the recommendations, nothing is working. It shouldn't be like this. I just want to add 1 wifi point. Should be easy.\nSaturday\nThis is ridiculous. Been trying to get this working for so long\nMonday\nThis issue is persisting with me as well. Trying to add one Google Wifi point to existing mesh network and stuck at adding to mesh stage. have tried factory reset, hardwiring, power cycling, etc. multiple versions of app with no luck.\nMonday\nI gave up! I went out and bought a whole new system (ubiquiti dream pro 7). I had a great 10-year run with Google Wi-Fi. this is so disappointing.\nBye bye Google\nMonday\nYes. I have had them for years and recommended them to probably 5 other families but I wouldn't anymore. They are slower than the competition (I have 1 giga on my modem, but never more then 500 on my nest plugged into the modem). And now this inability to add a puck. And solutions like factory reset the whole system etc. one is not even confident that after resetting the system it will work as before. Zero confidence, sorry\nMonday\nA failed experience with technical support. I was contacted after posting more than 10 topics in Google's forum, but technical support was unsuccessful and impossible. After 4 hours of communicating with me directly and sharing the network with support, they failed to solve the problem and ignored the response. What happened to you, Google? What happened to you? Is it reasonable that a large technical support is unable to solve a problem that everyone has complained about!!?\n14m ago\nNow 148 REPLIES\nand support google\nHe does not react, does not care, and has not found any solution to the problem.",

    "text": "PR de Cabo Verde pede \"confiança e alento\" para acreditar num ano de paz em 2024 O Presidente de Cabo Verde, José Maria Neves, pediu hoje aos cabo-verdianos \"confiança e alento suficientes\" para acreditar que 2024 será um ano de paz, com menos pobreza, desemprego e menos desigualdades sociais. \"Temos de ter confiança e alento suficientes para acreditar que 2024 será um ano de paz, principalmente pela cessação dos conflitos com evidente desprezo pela vida humana\", afirmou José Maria Neves, na tradicional mensagem de novo ano. O chefe de Estado cabo-verdiano sublinhou os \"tempos difíceis\" que se vivem a nível mundial, no contexto dos conflitos na Ucrânia e no Médio Oriente, assinalando as incertezas do próximo ano. \"É certo que atravessamos uma crise estrutural global, para a qual ainda não se vislumbra nem o fim, nem a duração, e nem o seu desfecho. São tempos difíceis, de crise e de estagnação, e com um retrocesso histórico na democracia. A sensação é a de que a insensatez impera, e que vozes autorizadas, como as do Secretário Geral das Nações Unidas ou do Papa Francisco, têm pregado no deserto\", assinalou. Recordando que Cabo Verde defende a Carta das Nações Unidas e o Direito Humanitário, José Maria Neves manifestou o desejo de que terminem \"as situações coloniais anacrónicas de ocupações ilegais de territórios\", repudiando também \"os ataques maciços infligidos à população civil indefesa, com massacres de mulheres e crianças, só comparáveis ao pior que aconteceu durante a segunda guerra mundial\". \"Ambicionamos por um 2024 com menos pobreza, menos desemprego e menos desigualdades sociais, que são fenómenos corrosivos, para qualquer sociedade. Que estejamos determinados a encontrar os melhores caminhos, principalmente para a redução da pobreza extrema, eliminando a insegurança alimentar e as condições de vida degradantes, garantindo uma existência mais digna para todos os cabo-verdianos\", referiu. Como um outro desafio para o ano novo, o Presidente da República apontou a questão da insegurança e da criminalidade em Cabo Verde. \"Esperamos mais sucesso nesta luta, a bem de um clima de maior tranquilidade e harmonia social\", sustentou. José Maria Neves destacou também a necessidade de melhorar a qualidade da educação e de ter em conta as reivindicações dos professores, bem como de promover uma melhor avaliação da prestação dos serviços disponibilizados na área da saúde. \"Nos transportes, marítimos e aéreos, face à regressão que se constata, auguramos que aconteçam melhorias significativas durante este ano. No geral, desejamos que as reivindicações de vários grupos profissionais possam merecer a devida atenção, pois, muitas delas parecem ser justas\", continuou. Indicou ainda que o diálogo deve ser eleito como a \"melhor forma\" para encontrar soluções para os diferendos e apontou uma revisão da política salarial do Estado, para que haja \"maior equilíbrio\" e justiça entre os diferentes grupos profissionais. \"Nos próximos anos, devemos dispensar uma atenção especial aos oceanos, sendo fundamental a sua proteção e também potenciar todos os recursos marinhos. Vivemos tempos difíceis, pelo que continua a ser necessário envidar esforços para garantir, tanto a segurança alimentar como a segurança energética, bem como implementar inovações tecnológicas\", disse José Maria Neves.",
