    "title": "Scientists Haven’t ‘Saved’ the Ozone Layer",
    "text": "Another year has passed, and that stubborn ‘Ozone Hole’ over Antarctica refuses to go away\nData from NASA shows that the area of the ‘Ozone Hole’ remains about the same as it has been over the last 30 years .\nBut will scientists admit that they didn’t save the ozone layer?\nBackground Ozone is a gas made up of three oxygen atoms (O 3 ). Ninety percent of the ozone in the atmosphere is found in the stratosphere, a layer of atmosphere between about 10 and 50 kilometers in altitude.\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere varies with time of year.\nDr. Mario Molina and Dr. Sherwood Rowland of the University of California published a paper in 1974 warning that industrial chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) pollution was destroying the ozone layer in Earth’s stratosphere.\nCFCs were gases used in hair spray, refrigerators, and insulating foams.\nThe theory of Molina and Rowland postulated that CFCs from human industry move upward through the atmosphere to the stratosphere, where ultraviolet radiation breaks down CFC molecules, releasing chlorine atoms.\nChlorine then acts as a catalyst to break down ozone molecules into oxygen, reducing the ozone concentration. According to the theory, the more CFCs consumed, the greater the destruction of the ozone layer.\nIn 1983, researchers from the British Antarctic Survey discovered a thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica which occurred during August, September, and October.\nThis became known as the ‘Ozone Hole’, and appeared to confirm the theory of Molina and Rowland, who were awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1995 for their work.\nMontreal Protocol (1987) The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet rays, shielding the surface of the Earth from high-energy radiation. According to scientists, degradation of the layer would increase rates of skin cancer and cataracts and cause immune system problems in humans.\nIn Earth in the Balance (1992), Al Gore claimed that hunters reported finding blind rabbits in Patagonia and that fishermen were catching blind fish due to human destruction of the ozone layer, but this was not confirmed .\nIn 1987, 29 nations and the European Community signed the “ Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer ”. Over the next decade, signers of the treaty rose to over 180 nations, all agreeing to ban the use of CFCs.\nBecause of the Montreal Protocol ban, world consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODS), or chlorofluorocarbons, began falling in 1990. By 2005, ODS consumption was down 90 percent and is now down more than 99 percent, according to the European Environment Agency .\nThe result? The Montreal Protocol was hailed as an example of international success of how nations could unite to resolve a major environmental issue.\nBut despite the elimination of CFCs, the ‘Ozone Hole’ remains as large as ever.\nNASA reported this fall that the mean ‘ozone hole’ area for September 7 to October 13 again reached 23 million square kilometers, roughly the same level as in the last three decades stretching back to 1994–1995.\nThe hole remains large, despite that fact that world ODS consumption has almost been eliminated.\nIn 2015, scientists at NASA predicted that the ‘Ozone Hole’ would be half closed by 2020. That hasn’t happened\nOther scientists have forecasted that the ‘hole’ will not begin to disappear until 2040 or later.\nBut the longer the ‘hole’ persists, the greater the likelihood that the ozone layer is dominated by natural factors, not human CFC emissions.\nSee more here masterresource.org\nBold and italic emphasis added\nEditor’s note: Antarctic ozone was first measured in the International Geophysical Year of 1957, and there never has been a ‘hole’ in the ozone layer. There is a natural thinning over the poles that waxes and wanes, as seen in the image above. It there was an area with zero ozone over Antarctica, no-one would be able to live and work there.\nPlease Donate Below To Support Our Ongoing Work To Defend The Scientific Method PRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.

    "title": "L.A. Lakers mystique was alive and well in '23 on DraftKings' sportsbook in Ontario.",
    "text": "TORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors.\nThe Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action.\n\"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors.\n\"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\"\nThe Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets.\nThe Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series.\nToronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth.\nToronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers.\nAvello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list.\n\"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\"\nThe Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots.\nNo Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks.\nToronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops.\nLast month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year.\n\"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\"\nSurprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC.\nBuffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot.\n\"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada.\n\"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\"\nBuffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth.\nOntario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion.\nToronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967.\n\"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\"\nThe Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth).\nRick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference.\nPeter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates.\n\"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play.\n\"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.\nDan Ralph, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "Richard Perry, productor musical de grans èxits com ara 'I'm so excited'",
    "text": "música\nRichard Perry, productor musical de grans èxits com ara ‘I’m so excited’\nVa treballar amb artistes com ara Barbra Streisand, The Pointer Sisters i Ringo Starr\nDol en el món de la música. El productor musical Richard Perry, conegut per treballar durant la dècada dels setanta i vuitanta amb figures com ara Carly Simon, Barbra Streisand i The Pointer Sisters, va morir dimarts en un hospital de Los Angeles a causa d’una aturada cardíaca a l’edat de 82 anys, segon recull The New York Times.\nNascut a Brooklyn l’any 1942, els seus pares tenien una empresa que es dedicava a fabricar i vendre instruments. També feien de professors de música. El 1955, a l’edat de 12 anys, va assistir al primer dels espectacles de rock en directe d’Alan Freed al Paramount Theatre. Durant la seva adolescència, va començar la seva carrera en la música rock com a intèrpret local i més endavant va començar la seva carrera com a intèrpret. Tot i així, un cop va acabar la llicenciatura, es va decantar per dedicar-se al món de la música. Anys més tard es va convertir en un productor musical de gran èxit, amb més d’una dotzena de discos d’or el 1982.\nDe fet, durant la dècada dels setanta i vuitanta, Perry es va convertir en un dels productors més sol·licitats de la música pop i va produir més de trenta èxits que van arribar al top 20 de la llista Hot 100. D’entre els seus grans èxits, destaquen cançons com ara Without you, de Harry Nilsson, i You’re so vain, de Carly Simon, que van arribar a la primera posició del Billboard Hot 100 i van estar nominades als premis Grammy com a enregistrament de l’any. Altres temes que exemplifiquen l’estil de producció de Perry són When I need you, de Leo Sayer, i Stand tall, de Burton Cummings.\nEntre les cançons que va produir també hi ha la versió de Barbra Streisand de Stoney end, de Laura Nyro, la primera immersió de l’estrella novaiorquesa en la música pop contemporània. Altres èxits que va ajudar a crear Perry són alguns de Ringo Starr, com ara Photograph i You’re sixteen, així com alguns dels grans temes de The Pointer Sisters, com ara I’m so excited i Jump (for my love).\nMés enllà del pop, va intervenir a To all the girls I’ve loved before, una col·laboració de Julio Iglesias i Willie Nelson que el 1984 va arribar al número 1 de la llista Hot Country Songs i va guanyar el premi a senzill de l’any en els guardons de l’Acadèmia de Música Country.\n[Identificar-me](/registre/compte/verificat.html?return=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxwdW50YXZ1aS5jYXQvYXJ0aWNsZS8yOS1uZWNyb2xvZ2lxdWVzLzI0OTE5NjItcmljaGFyZC1wZXJyeS1wcm9kdWN0b3ItbXVzaWNhbC1kZS1ncmFucy1leGl0cy1jb20tYXJhLWktbS1zby1leGNpdGVkLmh0bWwjY29tbWVudHM=&msg=34bd8f3599cdc6f6308d40855bdb2a1b).

    "text": "Allamano santo, padre Lengarin: una grazia, in Africa maturano tante vocazioni\nAntonella Palermo - Città del Vaticano\n\"È un momento di grazia\". Così il keniano padre James Lengarin IMC, Superiore Generale dei Missionari della Consolata, commenta la notizia della imminente canonizzazione del fondatore, il beato Giuseppe Allamano. Con 900 religiosi sparsi nel mondo, con una età media di 53 anni, la congregazione nata poco più di un secolo fa può contare su molti anziani i quali, tuttavia, \"ancora possono fare tanto\", portando avanti il carisma di andare alle frontiere, con entusiasmo, dedizione e creatività.\nAndare \"ad gentes\"\nCi risponde dall'Argentina, il Superiore: \"Mi trovavo in Colombia per la XIII Conferenza regionale con una sessantina di padri, quando è giunta la notizia: è una gioia immensa perché l'abbiamo attesa per tanti anni. È un momento di grazia\". Padre Lengarin ricorda l'origine della costituzione di questa famiglia di consacrati: \"Noi siamo stati fondati soprattutto per i non cristiani. Il nostro fondatore fu ispirato molto dall'attività missionaria dei sacerdoti di Don Bosco. Per lui la massima preoccupazione è sempre stata quella di andare a portare il Vangelo a coloro che non conoscono Dio. Inoltre, la promozione umana è stata un aspetto molto importante che lui ha sempre sottolineato\".\nCresciuto fra i salesiani, Allamano a 22 anni è sacerdote e coltiva il sogno di partire in missione, ma la salute cagionevole non glielo permette. All'età di 29 anni lo mandano a dirigere il più grande Santuario mariano di Torino dedicato alla Madonna Consolata che riporta agli splendori di un tempo. Il fuoco per la missione lo trasmette a giovani preti che, formati alla scuola del loro rettore, si preparano a salpare per le terre lontane. Così si gettano le basi per l’Istituto Missioni Consolata (IMC), che fonda nel 1901 costituendo, su richiesta di Pio X, anche un ramo femminile con le Suore Missionarie della Consolata (MC) nel 1910. Il miracolo che porterà alla canonizzazione ci riporta in Brasile, nello Stato di Roraima, in piena foresta amazzonica, che resta dal 1948 una delle mete dell'impegno missionario.\nCome cambia la geografia della missione\nPadre James racconta come nel tempo, soprattutto dalla fine degli anni Novanta, l'evangelizzazione sia cambiata moltissimo. E ricorda quando, dopo la prima parte della sua formazione in Inghilterra, venne in Italia:\"Erano tempi difficili poiché noi eravamo stati formati per la missione 'ad gentes' e l'epoca ci imponeva di restare in missione in Europa, cosa che non ci saremmo aspettati. Perché, ci dicevano, la missione ora è ovunque\". Del resto, è evidente che sia l'Africa a maturare oggi tante vocazioni e che i bacini delle vocazioni stesse si siano quasi completamente ribaltati rispetto ai secoli scorsi. \"Io ricordo che quando sono entrato nella congregazione desideravo andare in Amazzonia, la cosa infatti che mi attraeva di più era lavorare con gli Indios. Invece mi hanno detto che sarei dovuto restare in Italia. L'allora Superiore mi disse che l'Italia era terra di missione e che dovevo rimanere qua. Non ci ho dormito tutta la notte. Sono stato mandato al Sud, vicino Lecce, a Galatina\". Racconta che all'inizio la gente del posto lo guardava con sospetto rivendicando il fatto che loro non erano come le persone \"che non conoscevano Dio\". Ci restò cinque anni, scoprendo poi che quella esperienza era stata inaspettatamente bella e capace di cambiargli la vita.\nDall'Africa vocazioni in crescita\nQuanto contano i numeri? Contano, spiega padre Lengarin, perché quando si può contare su un numero consistente di giovani energie si può progettare di \"aprire nuovi luoghi di sfida\". Accenna, per esempio, alla condizione degli afro-discendenti tra i quali, osserva, ci sarebbe molto da fare perché generalmente \"siamo portati ancora a non riconoscere i loro valori\". Precisa che in diverse regioni essi non hanno ancora avuto una piena integrazione: accade, per esempio, in Brasile, Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua. In Africa, i Pigmei della foresta tropicale del Congo, destano molta attenzione da parte dei Missionari della Consolata che avrebbero in animo di operare maggiormente in loro favore anche per promuovere una sana e non traumatica attivazione di collegamenti tra i loro gruppi chiusi e il resto della società. Proprio dall'Africa, peraltro, \"prevediamo che nasceranno ancora vocazioni, se si segue la tendenza attuale, una decina o una ventina l'anno\". Le priorità apostoliche dell'Istituto restano gli indigeni d'America, gli abitanti nella vasta regione amazzonica, i centri urbani con le parrocchie e, attività ritenuta fondamentale, i centri educativi.\nGrazie per aver letto questo articolo.
