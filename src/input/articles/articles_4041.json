    "text": "बिहार के कैमूर एक स्कूल का डोलता कमरा चर्चा का विषय बना हुआ है। इस स्कूल की इमारत दो मंजिला है, जिसका एक कमरा हिल रहा है। खास बात यह है कि इसी इमारत के बाकी कमरे सामान्य हैं, लेकिन एक कमरा हिल रहा है। इस हिलते कमरे को देखकर शिक्षक से लेकर बीडीओ तक सभी हैरान हैं। फिलहाल इस कमरे से बच्चों की कक्षाएं हटा दी गई हैं और स्कूल के बाकी कमरों में पढ़ाई हो रही है। जेई को इस कमरे की जांच करने के लिए कहा गया है। दूसरे कमरे में होगी पढ़ाई शिक्षक सुद्रिक पाल ने बताया \"जब मैं यहां आया तो उस समय कमरा नहीं हिल डोल रहा था। करीब पांच मिनट के बाद दोबारा कमरा हिलने-डोलने लगा। तब मैं समझा कि कमरा डोल रहा है। इस बात की जानकारी मिलते ही बीडीओ दृष्टि पाठक मौके पर पहुंचे। इन्होंने बताया कि जब मैं वहां पहुंचा तो शिक्षकों और ग्रामीणों ने इस घटना के बारे में बताया गया। शिक्षकों व बच्चों की सुरक्षा को लेकर इस भवन से हटा कर दूसरे कमरे में पढ़ाने का निर्देश शिक्षकों को दिया गया है। इसकी जांच करने के लिए विभागीय जेई को दूरसंचार के माध्यम से निर्देश दिया गया है। जब तक जांच नहीं हो जाती है तब तक बच्चों का पठन-पाठन दूसरे भवन के कमरे में होगा। (कैमूर से मुकुल जायसवाल की रिपोर्ट)",

    "title": "Funding woes jeopardize future of Georgetown pallet village",
    "text": "By Jose Ignacio Castaneda Perez ,\n1 hour ago The Springboard Village is composed of 40 cabins that provide people experiencing homelessness with transitional housing and resources. Spotlight Delaware photo by Jose Ignacio Castaneda Perez\nThis story was originally published on Spotlight Delaware .\nGeorgetown’s transitional housing pallet village is facing a funding shortfall, jeopardizing the project that houses 40 people experiencing homelessness in Sussex County.\nThe village’s nonprofit operator, The Springboard Collaborative , was hoping to receive a $1.5 million grant this year from the Longwood Foundation, the Wilmington-based charitable grantmaking foundation linked to the du Pont family. It didn’t receive that funding, however, and is now struggling to find funders for its operational expenses.\nThe 40-cabin community, known as Springboard Village, imposed broad layoffs and cut staff costs by 28% in recent weeks.\nThe village, located in Georgetown’s largely-Latino Kimmeytown neighborhood, works to stabilize folks experiencing homelessness by providing resources and guiding them to permanent housing. The community has sheltered 131 people since it first opened in early 2023.\nThe village’s potential closure may displace its 40 residents, possibly contributing to the wooded encampments and homeless population in Georgetown, the seat of Sussex County. The funding woes come as Delaware struggles with rising rates of homelessness and a decreasing number of affordable housing units statewide.\nNationally, a chronically homeless person costs the taxpayer upward of $35,000 a year on average, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness . Delaware spends millions of dollars annually, across a slew of agencies and nonprofits, toward homeless resources.\nThe number of people experiencing homelessness in Delaware rose by 9% in 2024 with 1,358 people experiencing homelessness as of January, according to the annual Point-In-Time survey . That number is the highest total count on record in Delaware, excluding the pandemic years of 2021 and 2022, according to the report.\nThe collaborative currently has three months of cash reserves and is aiming to secure nearly $1 million in operational funding from a “patchwork of potential support” to keep it afloat until the next legislative session, according to Judson Malone, executive director and co-founder of the Springboard Collaborative.\nJudson Malone, executive director and co-founder of The Springboard Collaborative, says the funding shortfall is only one more obstacle that the organization is facing on top of the many it faced in opening and operating. Spotlight Delaware photo by Jose Ignacio Castaneda Perez\nLongwood gave Springboard an $800,000 grant in the spring of 2022 but has not announced any subsequent funding. When reached for this story, the foundation said that it does not comment on its grantees.\nSpringboard is hoping to secure state support by late August, Malone added.\nFollowing staff layoffs, the organization is training residents to become paid “community stewards,” who upkeep the village and provide security. Springboard Collaborative officials maintained that the village will not be closing, but have notified residents of the issue and drafted a contingency transition plan if the closure comes to be.\n“That’s the mountain we’re climbing,” Malone said. “It’s tough, but we’re tough people.”\n64-foot-square pallet cabins Mitchell Weicksel likes to go down to the ocean sometimes. He looks for driftwood or pretty rocks.\nWeicksel had been displaced from his lone tent in the woods after a state trooper left a note on it asking him to leave. He had been a resident of the village for roughly three months.\nNow, Weicksel sat at a picnic table at the Springboard Village as the setting sun waned above him on a recent afternoon. He donned a loose denim shirt and propped a pair of sunglasses atop his head.\nMitchell Weicksel, right, and Lewis Myers, Springboard Village residents, were grateful for the services that they’ve received from the organization. Spotlight Delaware photo by Jose Ignacio Castaneda Perez\nThe private 64-square-foot cabins are outfitted with microwaves, heat, electricity, air conditioning and a mini-refrigerator. Springboard allows pets and couples to live together, which are some restrictions that often keep folks from entering other shelters.\nThe cabins were bought with $500,000 in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds from the town of Georgetown. In July 2023, Springboard received over $2.4 million in ARPA capital funds to be used to build infrastructure.\nNearly $1 million was allocated for a new community center in the Georgetown village, complete with a commercial kitchen and office space. The other $2.4 million was earmarked to build a new village elsewhere in the state.\nIt’s “very unusual” for a small town to receive governmental support for an approach like Springboard, but it serves as a model for other communities, according to Stephen Metraux, an associate professor at the University of Delaware who studies homelessness.\nMetraux, an advisory board member of the Springboard Collaborative, said that the housing-first approach is the “golden-standard” to addressing homelessness. Springboard offers an intermediate housing approach before a permanent housing-first model is reached.\nThere were early plans to possibly build a village in Wilmington or Dover, but those have been put on ice until operational funding is secured. The ARPA funding can only be used to build structures and infrastructure, and is prohibited for operational expenses – leading to a conundrum where closure is possible despite millions being allocated.\n“Bricks and sticks,” Malone said, referring to how the capital-only funding can be used.\nExpansion considered amid community concerns The latest financial difficulties for the Springboard Collaborative is a dramatic turn from just six months ago when the nonprofit was eyeing its first expansion project.\nIn January, Milford City Council considered a proposal to build a Springboard village in town. Dozens of residents voiced their support and opposition of the potential project during the meeting.\nSupporters argued the new village would be a step in the right direction of mitigating homelessness and affordable housing issues in the area.\nDisapproving residents raised concerns about the village attracting more people experiencing homelessness to Milford and its low-barrier approach, which doesn’t require residents to be sober to be admitted.\nIn Georgetown, residents of the surrounding Kimmeytown neighborhood have raised nuisance concerns about people experiencing homelessness knocking at their doors and milling outside their homes through the night.\nNumerous local residents raised nuisance concerns surrounding the village during a Spotlight Delaware community listening session in Georgetown this spring.\nResidents don’t have a curfew and can largely come and go as they please. The village has an established policy that requires residents to be either inside or outside the space from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.\n“We tell our participants to be respectful and for the most part, they are,” Malone said. “Almost every community in any town is going to have those issues to one degree or another.”\nAnytime a project like Springboard is built in communities, it can be more or less expected to get these concerns and community pushback, Metraux noted.\nThe village and homelessness in Georgetown was at the center of a contentious mayor’s race this year that was ultimately won by incumbent Mayor Bill West, a Springboard Collaborative board member, in a 34-vote victory.\nIN THE NEWS: New laws reshape DIAA and high school sports\nWest’s opponent, former Georgetown councilwoman Angela Townsend, labeled the village as a magnet for homelessness in the area as she largely focused her campaign around the issue.\nWest underscored his stance that the village is not attracting people experiencing homelessness to town, citing a small waitlist to enter the village. Folks are coming to Georgetown because of other homelessness resources and food being offered in town, he said.\n“Everybody wants to say the pallet village is drawing the people to Georgetown,” West said. “If that was true, why don’t we have a waiting list of 30 or 40 people?”\nTown officials are trying everything in their power to prevent the village from shutting down and displacing its residents, according to West. The potential closure would put a “black eye” on West and would not be good for Georgetown, he added.\n“We are going to get through this,” West said.\nTrish Hill sat inside her office at the Springboard Village on a recent afternoon. Hill, Springboard’s project manager, joined the project before the village was even built and conducted outreach to the wooded encampments.\nShe’s put a lot of her soul into the program, she said.\n“If the program were to not be, it would take a good chunk of my soul with it,” Hill said. “Sometimes you just have to live in the present and do good work and hope that it gets noticed.”\nHill has faith. Malone has always come through and figured it out.\nGet Spotlight Delaware stories like this delivered to your email inbox by signing up for the free newsletter at spotlightdelaware.org/subscribe.

    "text": "Redução na arrecadação impõe mudanças no grupo do Inter ainda nesta janela Quedas da Copa do Brasil e da Sul-Americana frustram a entrada de receitas, inviabilizando a manutenção da atual folha de pagamentos publicidade A série de frustrações em campo trazem consigo uma consequência que extrapola as quatro linhas [no Inter](https://www.correiodopovo.com.br/esportes/inter). Devido à queda de receitas que haverá após a saída do time colorado da Copa do Brasil e da [ Sul-Americana](https://www.correiodopovo.com.br/esportes/inter/inter-s%C3%B3-empata-com-o-rosario-central-e-est%C3%A1-fora-da-copa-sul-americana-1.1515465), mudanças no grupo de jogadores são praticamente inevitáveis. Afinal, sem o dinheiro das premiações dos dois torneios e diante do inevitável desinteresse por parte dos torcedores, o clube não conseguirá sustentar uma folha de pagamentos que já supera os R$ 20 milhões mensais. Um enxugamento do grupo deve ser levado a cabo nas próximas semanas. No orçamento apresentado pelo conselho de gestão ao Conselho Deliberativo no ano passado, o clube projetava ser campeão gaúcho, além de chegar nas quartas de final da Sul-Americana e na semifinal da Copa do Brasil. Como cada fase superada em ambos os torneios garantiria a injeção de uma premiação nos cofres do clube, trata-se de mais uma receita frustrada. A meta que resta é alcançar o quarto lugar no Campeonato Brasileiro, que também está distante neste momento. Na realidade, a zona de rebaixamento está mais próxima do Inter, neste momento, do que o G-4. Porém, o clube tem cinco jogos a menos que o Botafogo, que é o líder do Brasileirão com 40 pontos − 21 a mais que os colorados. Como não vence há nove partidas, impondo, antes de nutrir qualquer outra ambição, uma reação já na partida contra o Bahia, amanhã, em Salvador. A janela de transferências para a maioria dos países europeus se encerra entre o final de agosto e o início de setembro. Até lá, o Inter deve negociar alguns jogadores. Vitão, Robert Renan e Wanderson possui sondagens. O volante Charles Aránguiz, que trata de um edema ósseo há um mês e ainda não tem previsão de volta, interessa a Universidad de Chile, enquanto o centroavante Lucas Alario tem proposta do futebol árabe. Neste ano, o Inter projetou a arrecadação de R$ 135 milhões com a venda de jogadores. As saídas realizadas até agora, principalmente a de Maurício ao Palmeiras, não cumpriram nem metade de meta, o que impõe novas negociações. Internamente, segue a pressão pelas saídas do vice de futebol, Felipe Becker, e do diretor esportivo Magrão. Até agora, nenhum dirigente manifestou-se sobre as recentes desclassificações.",

    "title": "A Complex Threat",
    "text": "The sophistication of support, both moral and tactical, extended by Al-Qaeda to the banned and outlawed Tehreek i Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has been noticed and observed once again in the report presented before the United Nations Security Council Committee. The report was presented by the group that monitors ISIL and Al-Qaeda. This is not the first time that focused research reports submitted to the UNSC have traced the connection between the TTP and Al-Qaeda. However, it is worrying to see the tactical prowess these networks are developing by inter-factional cooperation.\nTTP is a major security threat to Pakistan. Its presence in Afghanistan and the Afghan Taliban’s indecisive and passive attitude towards eliminating this threat has caused considerable irks between the two countries. On Pakistan’s pressure, Afghanistan’s interim government did capture some TTP men but the report notices that back channel support for the families of the TTP remains intact. This means that the Afghan Taliban are not ready to cut and reconsider their decades-long understanding and collaboration with the militant faction.\nThis is very much reminiscent of the time before the War on Terror when Al-Qaeda was largely operating from Afghanistan and had a close connection with the Afghan Taliban. It is also no secret that Al-Qaeda’s initial ideological influence helped lay the foundations of TTP. Keeping this history in view, it appears less surprising that TTP still has the support of Al-Qaeda. But this cooperation and interoperability of TTP with other militant factions tells that Pakistan is dealing with a complex threat matrix here.\nThe multifaceted threat posed by these militant alliances underscores the challenges in addressing terrorism comprehensively and necessitates international cooperation to dismantle these networks. Now that the UNSC has been made fully aware of the nature of the threat emanating from Al-Qaeda and extending to far-off regions through factions that operate locally, what is required is that transnational threats must be met with transnational responses. As for responding to the threat regionally, Afghanistan must cooperate with Pakistan. Pakistan has fought the war against the TTP like a lone warrior. But the threat expands beyond borders and as long as TTP has a safe home to run to, no decisive advantage can be gained or maintained.",

    "text": "Former South Dakota State QB Mark Gronowski reportedly gets 7-figure NIL deal from Iowa\nGronowski played four seasons for the Jackrabbits before heading to the Hawkeyes.\nFARGO — Former South Dakota State quarterback Mark Gronowski didn't have to head to the NFL to earn a big payday.\nGronowski landed a lucrative NIL (name, image, likeness) deal from the Iowa Hawkeyes reportedly worth seven figures, according to NBC 5 Chicago's Mike Berman.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It’s huge for my life and my family’s life and kind of starting out life with some extra money in your pocket can really set you up for the long term,\" Gronowski\ntold Berman\nin a recent television interview.\nGronowski announced he entered the transfer portal after this past season with the Jackrabbits. He played four seasons at SDSU and guided the program to two NCAA Division I FCS national championships for the 2022 and 2023 seasons.\nWith one year of college eligibility remaining, Gronowski decided to play for the Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference instead of enter the NFL Draft. He announced his committed to Iowa on Jan. 7 via social media.\n“At the next level in the NFL, nothing’s guaranteed,\" Gronowski told Berman. “With the NIL and everything like that you have a lot more opportunities and lot more guarantees within that.”\nDuring this past season, Gronowski accepted an invite to the East-West Shrine Bowl and appeared headed toward entering the NFL Draft. The Athletic's draft analyst Dane\nBrugler projected Gronowski to be a late-round\ndraft selection.\nIowa head coach Kirk Ferentz recently revealed that Gronowski would not participate in spring football for the Hawkeyes due to an injury and having surgery. Gronowski won't start on-field team workouts until June.\n“Mark played last season with a common football-related injury,” Ferentz said in a recent release. “While he could have continued to play through the injury, Mark is choosing to have a procedure to address the issue, and we support him in his decision. Our sports medicine team thoroughly reviewed his records and has confidence he will be fully rehabbed in time to participate in our summer program. Mark will participate in all non-practice team activities while he recovers.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nGronowski said he received strong interest from college programs once he entered the transfer portal.\n“The crazy thing was just all the text messages and the phone calls I was getting,\" Gronowski told Berman. \"I had over 100 missed texts and probably 20 missed calls on just the first day I was in the portal.”\nThe 6-foot-3, 230-pound Gronowski passed for 10,309 yards and 93 touchdowns in 55 career games for the Jackrabbits. He tied former North Dakota State quarterback Easton Stick for the most QB wins in FCS history with 49.\nGronowski led SDSU to the FCS semifinals this past season. The Jackrabbits lost 28-21 to eventual FCS champion NDSU.\nIn 2023, Gronowski won the Walter Payton Award, which is given to the top offensive player in the FCS.\nGronowski was ranked No. 19 in ESPN's transfer portal rankings.\nSouth Dakota sports talk radio host Nate Brown also recently interviewed Gronowski after his Iowa commitment.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGronowski said Ferentz was one of the reasons he chose the Hawkeyes. Ferentz reminded Gronowski of former SDSU head coach John Stiegelmeier, who led the Jackrabbits when Gronowski started his SDSU career.\n\"They have a great coaching staff there,\" Gronowski told Brown. \"Coach Ferentz he's very similar to Stig in a lot of ways, and he tries to build a culture that was very similar to Stig's. When I went there it really felt like South Dakota State as well.\"\nGronowski played for head coach Jimmy Rogers the two seasons at SDSU. Rogers recently took the head coaching job at Washington State.\nGronowski, from Naperville, Illinois, said playing close to home was also a factor in his Iowa decision. Iowa City, Iowa, is around 200 miles west of Naperville.\n\"I wouldn't have changed anything I did at South Dakota State, going there in the first place, but Big Ten football was always the dream growing up,\" Gronowski told Brown. \"To have the opportunity, I wanted to take advantage of it.\"\nGronowski said Iowa has a winning culture and added, hopefully, he would like to add an FBS championship to his two FCS national titles.\n\"We won a lot of football games at South Dakota State and I want to continue that at Iowa,\" Gronowski told Brown.\nADVERTISEMENT\n— Mark Gronowski (@mgronowski11)[January 7, 2025]\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",

    "text": "Fireworks have been captivating audiences for centuries, turning night skies into mesmerizing canvases of light and color. Among the various types of fireworks,\ncompound fireworks stand out as a pinnacle of pyrotechnic artistry and technical ingenuity. In this article, we delve into the world of compound fireworks, exploring the science, design, and the breathtaking displays that make them a true celebration of both art and chemistry.\nUnderstanding Compound Fireworks:\nCompound fireworks are a sophisticated form of pyrotechnics that involve the combination of multiple smaller fireworks into a single, choreographed display. Unlike single-shot fireworks, which consist of a single burst of color and light, compounds offer a symphony of effects, creating a dynamic and harmonious visual experience.\nThe Science Behind the Spectacle:\nAt the heart of compound fireworks is the meticulous blending of chemical compounds that produce different colors and effects. Pyrotechnicians carefully select and mix chemicals to achieve specific hues. Strontium compounds emit a brilliant red, copper produces a vivid blue, and barium yields a vibrant green. Combining these elements in precise ratios creates a kaleidoscope of colors that dance across the night sky.\nMoreover, the timing of each explosion is crucial. Pyrotechnic experts synchronize the ignition of individual components, ensuring that the display unfolds in a seamless and coordinated manner. This precision is achieved through computer-controlled firing systems that dictate the timing and sequence of each explosion.\nDesigning the Display:\nCrafting a captivating compound fireworks display is an art form. Pyrotechnicians consider factors such as the size of the venue, the desired visual impact, and the audience's vantage point. The design process involves creating a storyboard that outlines the sequence of effects, transitions, and the overall narrative of the display.\nOne notable feature of compound fireworks is the ability to tell a story through visuals. Displays can start with low-intensity effects, gradually building to crescendos of light and sound. This narrative approach engages the audience, creating an emotional connection with the display.\nSafety Measures:\nWhile compound fireworks offer a breathtaking spectacle, safety is paramount in their production and execution. Pyrotechnicians adhere to strict safety protocols, ensuring that displays are executed without harm to spectators or the environment. Comprehensive training, careful handling of chemicals, and adherence to local regulations contribute to the safe execution of compound fireworks shows.\nThe Future of Pyrotechnics:\nAs technology advances, so does the world of pyrotechnics. Innovations in ignition systems, choreography software, and environmentally friendly pyrotechnic compositions are shaping the future of compound fireworks. Research into sustainable alternatives for traditional pyrotechnic chemicals is also gaining momentum, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental concerns.\nFor More Info :-\nbracknell fireworks\nbonfire night slough",
