    "text": "Olympic champion Karsten Warholm goes viral with snowy sprint workout\nWho says you can't run track in the winter?Photo by: Kevin Morris\nBecoming a world and Olympic champion demands unwavering mental strength and discipline. Not every training day is a breeze, especially when weather conditions turn harsh.\nKarsten Warholm, a Norwegian 400m hurdler, took his recent track workout outdoors in the middle of winter, embracing the frigid temperatures and a snow-covered track at Bislett Stadium in Oslo.\nIn an Instagram video, the three-time world champion showcased his determination, running shirtless in -21 C weather on a barely plowed track, with the sound of crunching ice beneath\n his PUMA spikes. Warholm powered through 150m sprint repeats, playfully hitting a wall of snow at the finish line, poking fun at the indoor 60m event (which has athletes run into a large mat after the finish).\n“I am putting the win in winter,” Warholm yelled in the video. “It’s -21 C outside, but no excuses.”\nFans were both amazed and baffled by Warholm’s audacious winter training, particularly his choice to run in spikes, shorts and no shirt in icy weather. The video humorously captured his coach, Leif Olav Alnes, dressed the opposite as Warholm, completely bundled and shivering, holding a stopwatch at the finish line.\nSocial media exploded with comments, with fans playfully saying, “How to get hypothermia 101.” Even former four-time Olympic sprint medallist Ato Boldon joined in, jokingly asking, “Was the indoor facility unavailable?”\nWarholm, the reigning Olympic and world champion in the men’s 400m hurdles, holds five of the top 10 400m hurdles times in history, including his world record of 45.94 set\n at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. This video of his extreme winter training has to be a tribute to his Viking ancestors, showcasing his reputation as one of the toughest sprinters in the world.",

    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to go top of the Premier League. Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - Sky Sport\nArsenal spurned the opportunity to retake first place in the Premier League as they lost 2-0 to fellow Londoners West Ham United at the Emirates.\nWest Ham only had three efforts on target, but Tomas Soucek gave them a halftime lead before former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos extended the advantage after the break.\nArsenal had more than twice as many chances but failed to take any as the visitors defended gamely.\nWest Ham took the lead against the run of play after 13 minutes when Soucek knocked home after a pull-back from Jarrod Bowen who looked as if he just managed to keep the ball in play.\nBrighton put Tottenham to the sword on the south coast. Photo credit: Getty Images After that it was an Arsenal blitz with Bukayo Saka crashing the ball against the post and Gabriel Jesus missing two good opportunities before Mavropanos scored with a thumping header from a James Ward-Prowse corner in the 55th.\nWest Ham could have made it three from three chances but Said Benrahma had a penalty saved in added time after a foul by former West Ham captain Declan Rice.\nSecond-placed Arsenal remain on 40 points, two behind Liverpool who beat Burnley 2-0.\nElsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur's top-four ambitions suffered a blow as they lost 4-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager.\nVictory would have put injury-hit Spurs above Manchester City into fourth, but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot.\nA powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro's penalty gave the hosts a deserved 2-0 lead at halftime as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton's intensity.\nThe visitors responded in the second half with Richarlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over.\nMore from Newshub\nMan City return to Premier League top four with comeback win over Everton\nMan Utd mount stunning comeback to sink Aston Villa, Liverpool move atop Premier League However, when Tottenham's late substitute Alejo Veliz fired home from close range in the 75th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header a miraculous comeback suddenly looked possible.\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on 30 points while Tottenham remain fifth on 36, a point behind Manchester City in fourth.\nReuters",

Adscrita al área de investigaciones especiales...\nInvestigadores del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) desarrollaron una herramienta de inteligencia artificial, la cual, puede valorar si un paciente con cáncer de piel, responderá o no al tratamiento de inmunoterapia.\nEste método, que utiliza los datos clínicos de las personas con melanoma, puede predecir si el tumor maligno podrá ser suprimido con la aplicación de la inmunoterapia, a través de la cual, las células inmunitarias eliminan a las células cancerosas.\nLo anterior, contribuirá a que los médicos determinen con mayor precisión el tipo de tratamiento que debe recibir un paciente con cáncer, señaló Laura Cecilia Bonifaz Alfonzo, coordinadora de Investigación en Salud de la Unidad de Educación e Investigación del IMSS.\nLa idea es que nuestro proyecto pueda apoyar a la elección del tratamiento del médico, es decir, que el médico pueda hacer esta prueba y con esto decidir si es adecuado que se dé esta terapia o buscar una estrategia alternativa”, explicó, la también directora de la investigación.\nPor su parte, Saraí Gisel De León Rodríguez, investigadora asociada en la Unidad de Investigación Médica en Inmunología del Hospital de Pediatría del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, añadió que en el caso de la inmunoterapia de bloqueo de puntos de control, hay estudios que han reportado que los pacientes tratados con esta terapia alcanzan una supervivencia global de aproximadamente 72 meses.\nEn contraste, dijo, en los tratamientos tradicionales para atacar al cáncer, como la quimioterapia, la mediana de supervivencia suele ser de 10 meses.\nNuestro objetivo es que con esta investigación en el futuro los pacientes que tienen esta enfermedad puedan ser tratados de forma más precisa, utilizando la terapia que mejor funcione para ellos, y no solo quedarnos con melanoma, que es esta neoplasia originada en la piel. Sino trasladarlo a otro tipo de tumores como: cáncer de mama, pulmón, etcétera, los cuales son susceptibles al uso de esta misma terapia”, señaló la especialista.",

    "title": "Boeing Machinists Reject 25% Pay Increase Offer, Vote to Strike Amid Contract Dispute",
    "text": "Boeing machinists, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), voted on Thursday to go on strike, impacting the company just as it struggles with ongoing financial and reputational challenges. The strike decision comes six months after the initial arrest of Boeing’s operations and represents another hurdle for the aerospace giant. Strike Decision and Its Immediate Impact The machinists, who number approximately 33,000, overwhelmingly approved the strike with 96% of votes in favor. The decision followed a contract proposal that had been rejected by 94.6% of the workers. The proposed contract, which offered a 25% pay increase over four years, failed to meet the union’s expectations, leading to the strike that will commence at one minute after midnight on Friday. IAM District 751 President Jon Holden emphasized the significance of the vote, stating, “This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future.” The strike marks a critical juncture for Boeing, which is already grappling with production delays and a tarnished reputation. Also Read: [USA: Pittsburgh School Evacuated After Unidentified Man Found On Campus](https://www.newsx.com/world/usa-pittsburgh-school-evacuated-after-unidentified-man-found-on-campus/) Boeing’s Response and Negotiation Efforts In response to the strike vote, [Boeing](https://www.newsx.com/world/boeing-secures-major-deal-with-union-25-pay-increase-and-job-security/) expressed its readiness to resume negotiations. The company stated, “The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union.” Boeing’s commitment to resolving the dispute reflects the urgency of stabilizing its operations amid ongoing challenges. Newly appointed CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over the role six weeks ago, made a last-ditch effort to avert the strike. Ortberg warned machinists that a walkout could jeopardize Boeing’s recovery and further damage the company’s relationship with its airline customers. He noted, “For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past.” Union’s Discontent and Demands The strike vote is a response to longstanding grievances among Boeing workers. Many machinists have expressed frustration over stagnant wages and concessions made since 2008 on pensions and healthcare. The contract proposal fell short of the union’s initial demand for a 40% pay increase over three years and did not fully restore traditional pensions. Adam Vogel, a Boeing worker, criticized the proposed raise as insufficient, calling it “a load of crap. We haven’t had a raise in 16 years.” Another worker, Broderick Conway, echoed sentiments of dissatisfaction, stating, “A lot of the members are pretty upset about our first offer. We’re hoping that the second offer is what we’re looking for.” Potential Consequences and Industry Impact The strike is expected to halt production of several key Boeing models, including the 737 Max, 777, and 767. However, production of the 787 Dreamliner, which is handled by nonunion workers in South Carolina, will not be affected. This work stoppage will further strain Boeing’s finances, potentially costing up to $3.5 billion in lost cash flow, according to TD Cowen aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr. The timing of the strike, which might extend into mid-November, could exacerbate financial pressures on Boeing. The company’s recent history includes significant setbacks, including the two fatal 737 Max crashes and ongoing scrutiny over its safety practices. Historical Context and Future Prospects Boeing’s current strike is reminiscent of previous labor disputes, with the last major strikes occurring in 1995 and 2008. The potential long duration of the strike highlights the deep-seated issues within the company and the challenges ahead for Boeing’s new leadership. With the company facing increased competition from European rival Airbus and recovering from a series of operational issues, the outcome of this strike will be crucial in determining Boeing’s path forward.",

    "text": "C’est l’une des grandes figures de l’Église au XXe siècle : le cardinal polonais Stefan Wyszynski , béatifié en 2021, méritait bien qu’un biopic lui soit consacré. Né en 1901, nommé archevêque de Varsovie et primat de Pologne en 1948, il deviendra l’incarnation de la résistance au communisme. Emprisonné de 1953 à 1956, il écrit de sa prison un message qui sera lu en août devant un million de pèlerins à Czestochowa, deux mois après la révolte ouvrière de Poznan, première étincelle du feu qui conduira à la création de Solidarnosc .\nSorti de prison, il organise un cycle de neuf années de pèlerinages, de prières et de méditation pour préparer le millénaire du baptême de la Pologne, célébré en grande pompe en 1966, à la fureur des communistes : neuvaine que le cardinal avait pensée comme le terreau d’un renouveau spirituel de la nation, condition sine qua non de la restauration de son indépendance et de sa liberté.\n​ >> Retrouvez toutes nos critiques cinéma\nMort en 1981, il ne vivra pas assez pour voir la chute du communisme, dont il avait semé les germes, mais aura eu la satisfaction d’assister au coup de tonnerre spirituel et politique que fut l’accession de son poulain au pontificat sous le nom de Jean-Paul II. Très bien mis en scène et interprété, malgré un scénario qui manque de lignes de force, le film polonais Opération prophète (nom de code d’une opération des services communistes pour le discréditer) est une excellente occasion de découvrir ce personnage admirable.\n“Opération prophète”, de Michal Kondrat, un DVD Saje Distribution, égale ment disponible en VOD sur www.sajeplus.fr.",

    "text": "HARTFORD, Conn. — A [West Haven](https://www.fox61.com/section/new-haven-county/west-haven) woman was sentenced on Thursday in Hartford for diverting narcotics from veterans under her care as a nurse at the West Haven VA Medical Center, according to a [release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/pr/west-haven-woman-who-diverted-narcotics-dying-va-medical-center-patients-sentenced) from the [U.S. Attorney](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/meet-us-attorney) for the District of Connecticut.\nTara Severino, 58, was sentenced to two years of probation. She must spend the first six months in home confinement.\nCourt documents and statements make it clear that Severino worked as a registered nurse with the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Haven, where she was assigned to the VA’s Intensive Care Unit for sick or dying patients.\nProsecutors say that from January to July 2023, Severino ingested fentanyl, hydromorphone and oxycodone that was meant for patients in her care.\nAccording to prosecutors, sometimes Severino ingested the “waste” of a substance, which means that she administered part of the substance to a patient and ingested the remaining, unused portion.\nIn one case, Severino repeatedly introduced fentanyl into the system of a braindead patient. She later said she observed him in pain and having a seizure. Prosecutors say she gave this patient fentanyl approximately 19 times over a nine-day span so she could divert some for herself.\nOn a different occasion, Severino ingested doses of hydromorphone and fentanyl meant for dying patients, prosecutors say. This affected treatment decisions made by other medical staff, who were under the impression that the patients had been receiving, and were unresponsive to, their prescribed medications.\nIn a separate incident, prosecutors say Severino volunteered to care for a patient that wasn’t formally assigned to her, so that she could divert pain medication from him before he passed away.\nProsecutors report that Severino covered up her crimes by misrepresenting in VA medical records and tracking systems, so it appeared that the drugs were properly administered to the patients and had been properly disposed of.\nOn June 18, Severino pleaded guilty to obtaining controlled substances by fraud or subterfuge.\nThe case was investigated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of the Inspector General, while the Drug Enforcement Administration’s New Haven Tactical Diversion Squad and the West Haven Police Department assisted.\n----\nDalton Zbierski is a digital content producer and writer at FOX61 News.
