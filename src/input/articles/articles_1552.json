    "text": "By\nDustin Rowles | Film | August 29, 2024 |\nBy\nDustin Rowles | Film | August 29, 2024 |\nGood morning, and welcome to what is typically two of the slowest — if not the slowest — news days of the year, barring a late Friday news dump designed to avoid media scrutiny. Summer is ending. Labor Day is nigh. Most people are back from vacation but not yet ready to actually do work. You know what movies are released wide this weekend? No? No one else does, either. There are four wide releases, and not one of them will top $5 million. There will be screenings this weekend around the country that have literally zero people inside of them, so if you’re a teenager looking for a private place to make out, have we got the place for you!\nWe’ve never really done this before, but what better weekend than the deadest of the year to write a weekend movie preview?\nAfrAId — I’m guessing that this one will earn the most out of the four new releases. It might even break $5 million. It’s an AI horror movie (ugh, I know) starring John Cho, Katherine Waterston (Sam’s daughter), and the really cool actress from Shrinking who plays the daughter of Jason Segel’s character, Lukita Maxwell. It’s basically M3GAN, only it’s, like, Alexa or Siri instead of an Android. Looks like a real dud, notwithstanding the presence of Cho.\nReagan — Here’s the funny thing about most hardcore fans of Ronald Reagan in 2024: They’re Democrats now. Except for Dennis Quaid. That probably also says something about either how far to the right the Democrats have drifted or how far to the left that Never Trumperes have. Can you imagine Alex P. Keaton supporting Donald Trump? Anyway, no one really cares about Reagan anymore. Trump killed that, too (not that I’m complaining). Also, this movie looks like it was written by an 8th grader.\n1992 — Here, Tyrese Gibson has terrible facial hair, and Ray Liotta tries to pull off a heist on the first night of the Rodney King riots. I’m not sure why this one is not going straight to VOD, but I’m guessing someone thought they could get a few people in theater seats to watch the late great Liotta in what may be his final role, but only becasue the film has been sitting on the self for two years. Also, Snoop Dogg is a producer on this.\nCity of Dreams — It’s a movie about Mexican kids being sold into slavery starring Jason Patric, from the executive producer of Sound of Freedom, with a pull quote from Tony Robbins. Very hard pass.\nAnd there’s your weekend preview. My advice: If you’re hitting theaters, try and catch\nStrange Darling, a movie I hadn’t heard of before Jason’s review and now I’m seeing it everywhere and I cannot wait to watch.",

    "text": "Severe Threat Ends But Rain Lingers\nSevere Threat Ends But Rain Lingers\nCANCELED TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER OUT THERE. LET’S GET RIGHT ON OVER TO CHIEF METEOROLOGIST KEVIN ROBINSON. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT TONIGHT. HOW NASTY DO YOU THINK THINGS COULD GET? WELL, YOU KNOW, AS WE LOOK AT THE RADAR RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL SEVERE THREAT, YOU KNOW, I CAN’T HELP BUT QUESTION JUST HOW INTENSE THESE STORMS WILL BE. I THINK THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE PLENTY OF LIGHTNING WITH ANY STORMS THAT GO UP. AND THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE POCKETS OF TORRENTIAL, VERY HEAVY RAINFALL. IN FACT, LOCALIZED FLOODING COULD BECOME MAYBE THE GREATEST ISSUE WITH SLOW MOVING NATURE OF SOME OF THESE STORMS. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I DON’T THINK THERE’S GOING TO BE JUST A LOT OF BIG WIND WITH THIS SYSTEM. YES, YOU KNOW, MAYBE A COUPLE OF GUSTS HERE AND THERE. BUT NOTICE HOW THE NORTHERN END OF THIS LINE IS JUST REALLY STRUGGLED TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER PRETTY MUCH ALL DAY. NOW MOST OF THE ACTION IS ACTUALLY FARTHER TO THE SOUTH. BASICALLY, AS YOU HEAD DOWN INTO CARROLL COUNTY, PARTS OF OWEN COUNTY, THAT’S WHERE THE ACTIVITY IS A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED TONIGHT. SO IT’S REALLY GOING TO STAY. I THINK THE MOST INTENSE WEATHER YOU CAN SEE IT HERE, PROBABLY GOING TO STAY CLOSER TO LEXINGTON, MAYBE SCOOTING ACROSS PARTS OF OHIO AND SOUTHERN GRANT COUNTIES. BUT IN TERMS OF THOSE OF US UP CLOSER TO THE OHIO RIVER, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE WE MAY GET IN ON SOME RAIN AND THUNDER THIS EVENING AROUND HERE. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW WE’VE HAD THESE SPOTTY DOWNPOURS TRYING TO GO UP AND SOUTHEAST INDIANA. BUT NOTHING HAS SEEMINGLY ORGANIZED ITSELF JUST YET. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL BIG DOWNPOURS GOING UP. LOOK AT THAT RIGHT OVER DOWNTOWN CINCINNATI. THE VILLA HILLS LAKESIDE PARK COMMUNITY. THESE ARE BEGINNING TO GO UP. WATCH OUT. A LITTLE LIGHTNING WILL PROBABLY START TO POP OUT OF THOSE HERE AT ANY MOMENT. BIG DOWNPOURS GONE UP NORTH OF MONROE, NORTH OF WESTCHESTER, UP TOWARDS THE MASON AREA AND THEN UP TOWARDS HILLCREST AND IN THE LAMONI AREA, OVER TOWARDS MONROE. YOU CAN SEE THIS SLOW MOVING DOWNPOUR THAT IS BASICALLY DRIFTING RIGHT OVER INTERSTATE 75. SO WE’LL KEEP AN EYE ON THE RADAR. THERE’S A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM. WATCH OUT UNTIL 8:00, BUT AT THIS POINT, I THINK SEVERE WEATHER WE MAY LUCK OUT. KEEP IT AT A MINIMUM HERE. THIS EVENING. IT IS AWFULLY STEAMY OUT THERE. THAT’S WHY I CAN’T TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE ALTOGETHER. SOMETIMES THESE LINES CAN FIND THAT LITTLE EXTRA JUICE AND TRY TO INTENSIFY BRIEFLY. WE’LL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT AROUND HERE THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS, BECAUSE THERE’S PLENTY OF FUEL FOR THESE STORMS TO WORK WITH. ALL RIGHT. HERE’S FUTURECAST. YOU’LL SEE THIS COMING THROUGH. THERE’S A LOOK AT 730. TAKE YOU TO 8:00. TAKE YOU TO NINE. SO BY NINE, A LOT OF THIS IS PULLING OUT OF HERE. I THINK WE’RE STARTING TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS. IT’S QUIET MOST OF THE NIGHT. I WOULDN’T RULE OUT A STRAY DOWNPOUR OVERNIGHT AFTER THIS ACTIVITY ROLLS THROUGH, BUT GENERALLY QUIET AND DRIER. SO TOMORROW MORNING, A FEW HIT AND MISS DOWNPOURS AROUND THE AREA IS WHAT I WOULD EXPECT, AND THEN PROBABLY MORE DOWNPOURS FOR THE AFTERNOON. OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SEE OVER MY SHOULDER I JUST SHOWED YOU ON RADAR THAT BIG DOWNPOUR OVER DOWNTOWN CINCINNATI. LOOKS LIKE THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF WIND INVOLVED WITH THAT THERE. JUST BASED OFF THE FLAG. AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE HOW THE SHEETS OF RAIN ARE BEING DRIVEN. IT’S 87, SO IT’S NOT RAINING AT THE AIRPORT. SO THAT’S KIND OF THE NATURE OF THIS STUFF. SOME OF US WILL SEE BIG DOWNPOURS, OTHERS JUST SOME RAIN AND A LITTLE THUNDER. SO WE’LL KEEP THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE FORECAST THROUGH ESPECIALLY 9:00. AND THEN I THINK IT KIND OF TAPERS OFF FOR A MUCH QUIETER OVERNIGHT AS A WHOLE. 70 BY MORNING TOMORROW 86, WE’RE GOING TO KEEP IT ANOTHER WEATHER IMPACT DAY AS I THINK SCATTERED STORMS SHOULD BE PRETTY WIDESPREAD AGAIN, ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS. NOT A WASHOUT. IT WILL START TO DRY OUT FRIDAY EVENING. THE TENDENCY WILL BE FOR STORMS TO FADE AWAY FRIDAY EVENING AS THE SUN GOES DOWN. WE’RE GOING TO KEEP THE LINGERING STORM THREAT INTO THE DAY ON SATURDAY. BUT I THINK SATURDAY AFTERNOON WE’RE STARTING TO DRY OUT. IT GETS HOT GOING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 90S. BEFORE WE SEE TEMPERATURES COOL OFF.

    "title": "Study reveals a shocking number of MTB-related spinal cord injuries",
    "text": "New research from British Columbia sheds light on one of the most severe outcomes of mountain biking: spinal cord injuries (SCI).\nWhile many mountain biking injuries are minor, SCIs present profound physical, emotional and financial challenges. A 14-year study from BC’s Level 1 Trauma Center highlights the startling prevalence and economic impact of these injuries. Here’s what the data reveals and why it’s a wake-up call for the MTB community.\nSpinal cord injuries: a life-altering outcome SCI is one of the most devastating injuries a rider can sustain. Depending on the severity and location of the injury, it can result in partial or complete loss of motor and sensory function below the injury site. In the worst cases, SCIs lead to paraplegia (loss of lower body function) or quadriplegia (loss of all four limbs). Beyond the physical challenges, these injuries take an emotional toll on individuals and their families while imposing enormous financial burdens.\nThe BC study analyzed 58 SCI cases caused by MTB between 2008 and 2022. The average rider was a 35-year-old male, with most injuries (67 per cent) occurring in the cervical spine, leading to severe impairments. Nearly half of these cases (45 per cent) resulted in “motor complete” paralysis, where no motor function was preserved below the injury.\nWhat causes these injuries? The study found that most SCIs occurred during high-impact incidents. Protective gear was often minimal—only nine per cent of riders wore both helmets and body armor. These findings underscore the need for enhanced safety measures and education around proper equipment use.\nThe economic burden of MTB-related SCI According to the study, the financial impact of SCIs is staggering. The study divided costs into three categories:\n1. Initial direct costs: Including hospitalization, surgery and rehabilitation. These averaged $93,600 for incomplete injuries and $245,000 for complete quadriplegia.\n2. Lifetime direct costs: Ongoing expenses for medical care, adaptive equipment and home modifications often exceeded $4 million for severe cases.\n3. Other costs: Lost productivity and reduced quality of life added hundreds of thousands of dollars per case.\nFor the 58 MTB-related SCIs studied, the combined lifetime cost totaled $195.4 million. This figure doesn’t account for the immeasurable emotional toll on families and caregivers.\nComparing MTB risks to other sports The risk of SCI in MTB far exceeds that of many high-contact sports says the study. During the 14-year study period, only three hockey players in BC sustained SCIs, despite hockey being Canada’s national pastime. In the U.S., high school and college football—another high-risk sport—reported an average of 7.1 SCIs annually across the entire country. By comparison, BC alone saw an average of 4.1 MTB-related SCIs each year, a strikingly high rate given its smaller population.\nLessons from other sports: prevention is key The study goes on to explain that hockey and football have successfully reduced SCIs through targeted campaigns like “Heads Up, Don’t Duck” and stricter rules against dangerous play. The study suggests mountain biking can follow suit by focusing on:\nEducation: Riders need training on proper techniques, trail navigation and recognizing fatigue to reduce risky behaviors.\nEquipment: Promoting the use of high-quality, well-maintained bikes and protective gear tailored to MTB-specific risks, such as full-face helmets and body armor.\nTrail design: Trails should prioritize safety with features that mitigate excessive speed and include clear signage for challenging sections.\nA call to action for the mountain biking community The rising popularity of MTB is a double-edged sword; while the sport brings economic benefits and fosters a sense of adventure, it also increases the risk of life-altering injuries. To address this, collaboration between bike parks, trail designers and MTB organizations is essential concludes the study.\nThe BC study highlights the urgent need for dialogue within the MTB community. .\nConclusion: balancing adventure with safety Mountain biking pushes boundaries and tests limits, but its growing risks demand attention. The data from BC is a sobering reminder: 58 SCIs in 14 years, with a $195.4 million economic impact.",
