    "title": "Largest Young-Onset Dementia Study in the World Shows Hope for Prevention | IBTimes UK",
    "text": "A study done in the UK Biobank has revealed the dementia risk in young people if they have depression and Vitamin D deficiency.This is significant as NHS data predicts over one million people in the UK are likely to suffer from dementia by 2030. At present, one in 11 people over the age of 65 have a neurodegenerative disease. Over 944,000 people have dementia in the UK.According to an estimate made by the Alzheimer's Society of UK , 70,800 people have young-onset dementia where the disease kicks in before 60-65 years of age.In such a scenario, this study titled ' Risk Factors for Young-Onset Dementia in the UK Biobank ' is crucial as it sheds light on essential biomarkers like diabetes, depression and Vitamin D deficiency to prevent young-onset dementia.UK researchers identified 39 risk factors that cause young-onset dementia as opposed to the conventional belief that the disease is genetic. The scientists analysed 356,052 people below the age of 65 from 2006 to 2010 to identify these dementia risk factors.To understand the gender bias in young-onset dementia, the UK researchers selected 55.3 per cent women, which accounts for 197,036 women with 54.6 baseline age. The rest of the participants were men.The result of the study revealed 16 factors that significantly increased dementia risk including lower education level, lower socio-economic status, alcohol disorder, social isolation, hearing impairment, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, vitamin D deficiency and depression. The results were published in the Jama Neurology journal.According to UK researchers, the results are optimistic as they challenge the genetic notion of the disease into one that can be prevented by modifying the risk factors. Targeting these modifiable risk factors could reduce the extent of the young-onset dementia in the UK, said the scientists.Dr Janice Ranson, one of the authors of the UK Biobank study said: \"The study breaks new ground and could herald a new era for interventions to reduce new cases.\"The primary symptom in people suffering from dementia is the loss of memory but there are other problems like behaviour change and failure to recognise known places.So far this is the largest and the most robust young-onset dementia study conducted revealed Professor David Llewellyn, one of the authors of this UK and Netherlands-conducted study.Llewellyn cautioned that there is still much to know before we can develop a plan of action. However, according to him, the study showed that \"we may be able to take action to reduce the risk of this debilitating condition\".\"This pioneering study shines important and much-needed light on factors that can influence the risk of young-onset dementia,\" said Llewellyn.This comes at a time when a recent study highlighted the burden of dementia patients on the NHS and the UK healthcare system as people with dementia visit the emergency room 1.4 million times annually. Another author of the study, Dr Stevie Hendriks from the Maastricht University in the Netherlands highlighted the extent of the problem faced by young-onset dementia patients as most of them are \"still working and have children and a busy life\".Hendriks explained why they wanted to study this aspect of the disease as the exact cause isn't known and everybody assumes it's genetic. \"This is why we also wanted to investigate other risk factors in this study,\" he added.The researchers are hopeful about the awareness aspect of young-onset dementia as the study found people with higher educational levels are less prone to it, suggesting a better awareness of the disease risks.Dr Lean Mursaleen from Alzheimer's Research UK said the study filled an important gap in dementia knowledge.\"We're witnessing a transformation in the understanding of dementia risk and, potentially, how to reduce it on both an individual and societal level,\" said Mursaleen.© Copyright IBTimes 2023.

    "text": "Xalapa, Ver. “Es absurdo que nos digan que tenemos tránsito libre pero nos hagan caminar 57 días consecutivos bajo el sol, agua, frío, lluvia y no nos permitan abordar un autobús o algún medio de transporte que autorice migración para llegar a la frontera norte”, comentó Paulo Ballesteros Flores, coordinador de la Caravana Migrante integrada por más de 500 migrantes procedentes de ocho países de centroamérica, que este día llegó a Ixtaczoquitlán en su camino hacia la frontera norte de México.\nLos integrantes de la Caravana Migrante salieron de sus países en Centroamérica hace 57 días, por diversas razones que van desde la inseguridad que promueven las pandillas, los actos de represión de gobiernos autoritarios y la falta de oportunidades de empleos bien pagados.\nEl 30 de octubre, el grupo de migrantes cruzó la frontera de Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, para cruzar por Tapachula, Chiapas, donde comenzó su travesía por territorio nacional. En su viaje, han caminado bajo temperaturas extremas bajo el sol, lluvia, poco acceso a alimentos, o agua, que han mermado la salud de algunos de los integrantes.\nLa caravana de migrantes pidió al gobierno mexicano que les permita rentar autobuses que los trasladen a la frontera con Estados Unidos, pero las autoridades les han impedido tomar esta vía, y únicamente les permiten continuar caminando.\n\"Es ilógico ver sufrir a tantos niños y mujeres y no poder hacer nada, cuando ellos tienen la potestad para que podamos abordar un autobús o algún medio de transporte que nos lleve a la frontera norte\", insistió Ballesteros Flores, desde el Parque del Ejido Cuautlapan, ubicado junto al Ingenio El Carmen, donde la caravana se detuvo a descansar antes de continuar su viaje.\nDentro de esta caravana, conformada por 128 niños, 220 mujeres y 185 hombres, viajan personas como José Melvin Martinez, quien se hace acompañar de su esposa y su hija, en su travesía a Estados Unidos.\n\"Quiero ayudar a mi familia, tengo una familia muy pobre, una madre enferma, y sólo le pido a Dios llegar a donde tenemos que llegar para poder ayudar\", explicó.\nAmilcar Alemán, otro integrante de la Caravana, quien abandonó Honduras debido a la falta de empleo.\nDetalló que \"en Honduras está difícil la situación, el empleo allá no se consigue. Allá de donde venimos, las empresas despidieron al 80 por ciento del personal, esperamos un tiempo para ver si se recuperaba el empleo pero pasaron seis meses, un año y más de un año y, entonces ya no pudimos seguir esperando\".\nSe espera que la caravana migrante que llegó a Ixtaczoquitlán para descansar por unas horas, pronto reanude su camino hacia el norte del país. Es posible que busquen llegar a Orizaba o algún otro municipio de la zona de las Altas Montañas para pernoctar en un espacio y después continuar con su tránsito.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "Shota Imanaga and 2 relievers throw a combined no-hitter for the Chicago Cubs",
    "text": "Shota Imanaga realized something was up when he saw the look on manager Craig Counsell’s face.\nImanaga is used to seeing Counsell happy after the lefty produces a start like Wednesday night for the Chicago Cubs — seven shutout innings — but the skipper appeared a little worried as he approached him in the dugout. That’s when Imanaga learned there was an additional wrinkle to his stellar outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates: The Japanese star hadn’t allowed a hit through seven innings.\nImanaga, though, was at 95 pitches, not helped by a pair of errors from third baseman Isaac Paredes in the sixth, prompting Counsell to turn to the bullpen for the final six outs. Two hard-throwing relievers, Nate Pearson and\nPorter Hodge, picked up where Imanaga left off, combining to throw a no-hitter in the Cubs’ 12-0 victory.\nPeople are also reading…\nHodge forced Oneil Cruz to ground out weakly to shortstop Dansby Swanson to end the game. Hodge slapped his mitt and hugged catcher Miguel Amaya in celebration after watching first baseman Michael Busch secure the throw from Swanson. Amaya and the three pitchers signed the ball from the final out, and it will be donated to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n“Everybody contributed to this,” Amaya said. “Defense, each batter put their good at-bats down, it’s special. This is a beginning of a good streak. We can finish strong this season.”\nIt marked the 18th no-hitter in franchise history and the second combined no-no. The\nlast Cubs no-hitter was also a combined effort by Zach Davies, Ryan Tepera, Andrew Chafin and Craig Kimbrel on June 24, 2021, at Dodger Stadium.\nIt was the Cubs’ first no-hitter at Wrigley since Milt Pappas in 1972.\nImanaga typically heads to the trainers room after he exits a game for his post-start exercise routine. This time he stayed in the dugout to watch the final two innings.\n“Compared to Japan, all the players here get more excited about a no-hitter, and it doesn’t matter if the guys didn’t play, guys didn’t get a hit, everybody congratulated me,” Imanaga said through interpreter Edwin Stanberry. “Everybody was cheering me on. So I’m just thankful and I have a lot of respect for all my teammates who got excited for me, excited for the win.”\nCounsell had discussed with pitching coach Tommy Hottovy about pulling Imanaga after the sixth, ultimately letting him go one more inning. He understood it would not be a popular decision among fans.\n“It’s always hard to do in that situation, but you’re taking care of Shota,” Counsell said. “I mean, it’s 100% about taking care of Shota and making sure we’re doing the right thing for him. It’s not fun to do. But when you’re prioritizing the player’s health, you don’t know what’s going to happen moving forward, and we want him to stay healthy. He’s at a career high in innings and doing a great job.\n“That was, for us, the right thing to do.”\nImanaga wasn’t the only one involved who was unaware a no-hitter was progressing. Amaya and Pearson both found out what was happening when Cubs fans booed Pearson as he ran in from the left-field bullpen to warm up for the eighth inning.\n“I realized, ‘Oh, we’ve probably got something on the line,’ ” Pearson said.\nHodge was surprised to hear Pearson say that during the postgame interviews. He saw Pearson looking at the TV in the bullpen then glanced at it himself and picked up on the situation.\n“I smiled at him because I thought he knew but didn’t want to say anything,” Hodge said with a grin.\nPearson and Hodge kept a simple mentality with a no-hitter on the line. Pump strikes, attack the hitters and go one pitch at a time. Hodge described mixed emotions waiting for the ball to land in Busch’s mitt to end it, calling those final seconds nerve-wracking.\nAll three outs in the ninth were hit on the ground to Swanson, who was part of the first no-hitter of his career. He almost wasn’t on the field for the ninth. Counsell emptied the bench before the top of the eighth, taking out four starters, and Swanson was supposed to be part of it. When Swanson was informed he was being replaced, he bluntly said no and tried to convey why without outright verbalizing the no-hitter.\n“I think at first they thought it was more for trying to get a triple (for the cycle) and, man, I don’t know if I can run that far,” Swanson joked. “It was more for the defensive stuff. … I got my way.”\nSwanson, center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong and second baseman Nico Hoerner each had three of the Cubs’ 17 hits. Swanson, Crow-Armstrong and Cody Bellinger all homered in the rout.\nHoerner didn’t play in the Cubs’ last combined no-hitter in 2021 because of an injury and took in the last six outs Wednesday from the dugout. He appreciated how the tension within Wrigley continued to build as fans stuck around for a chance to witness history despite the lopsided score.\n“You could tell people were really locked in on the no-hitter from I think maybe the sixth inning I felt like you were getting more murmurs and things than normal in the crowd,” Hoerner said. “And that stuff is awesome, and it’s part of what makes a long season so exciting is every day can have something like that.”\nImanaga, who struck out seven Pirates, lowered his season ERA to 2.99 and leads the Cubs with 153 1/3 innings.\n“He’s just a true pro,” Swanson said. “He goes about his work the same every day, whether he’s had a good outing or a bad outing. He’s always wanting to get better. He’s always doing the routine that he needs to do to be able to go back out again in five days and be able to pitch well. He’s always prepared.\n“I’m not\nsurprised by anything he does.”\nImanaga hopped off the mound to end the seventh as he watched the latest Pirate flail and fail to get a hit. His strikeout of third baseman Jared Triolo capped the memorable night for Imanaga, who took a no-hitter into at least the sixth inning for the third time.\n“It’s really important for me to stay healthy for the whole season, throw my innings, make my starts, so he told me it’s time to switch pitchers, and I just trusted his judgment,” Imanaga said of the decision.\nImanaga’s main trouble came in the second when he walked two batters, prompting a visit from Hottovy. Otherwise, the trio of pitchers deftly navigated the Pirates lineup in the blowout win.\n“The presence, the confidence that he shows up there, every single pitch is with intention, it’s not just get me over,” Amaya said.\nThe day started with the Cubs coming off two tough losses following the high of an 8-1 trip and\nthe loss of Justin Steele — arguably their best starter — and reliever Jorge López to the injured list pregame, presenting a challenging backdrop to the team’s efforts to avoid being swept.\nWednesday’s postgame jubilation in the clubhouse provided a stark juxtaposition from the Cubs’ last 48 hours.\n“It’s a beautiful game we play,” Swanson said. “The best way to play this game is literally every day like we play it because if you let one day roll into two it ends up rolling into 10 and then next thing you know it’s been a terrible couple of weeks. … That’s why I think it’s such a good life-lesson teacher because bad things are going to happen. That’s inevitable. It’s more about how you respond to it, and we’ve done a great job of that.”",

Following this, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been investigating the incident. The firing happened on Wednesday (December 27) in the early morning at the residence of the son of Satish Kumar, the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, in Surrey. According to the police, no one was injured during the incident. According to the Constable Parmbir Kahlon, Media Relations Officer for Surrey Police, the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes. \"On December 27, 2023 at approximately 8:03 am, Surrey RCMP responded a to a report of shots fired at a residence in the 14900 block of 80 Avenue. No one was injured during the incident, but the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes. Police remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage.

The Surrey Police have not confirmed any link of the attack to recent threats received by the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey. Earlier in November, India-origin Canadian member of Parliament Chandra Arya shared a purported video of Pro Khalistani supporters in Surrey claiming they want to create trouble at the Hindu Lakshmi Narayan Mandir there. He wrote, \"Last week, Khalistan supporters verbally abused a Sikh family outside a Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, BC, according to some reports. Now it appears the same Khalistan group wants to create trouble at the Hindu Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey.\" Underscoring that Hindu temples have remained targets for attacks over the past years, Arya noted by saying, \"Hindu temples have been attacked many times during the last couple of years. Hate crimes are being committed against Hindu-Canadians.\" Moreover, a Hindu temple was vandalised in Canada by extremist elements with Khalistan referendum posters in August this year. In April this year, BAPS Swaminarayan temple was vandalised with anti-India graffiti in Windsor, in Canada's Ontario. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Meanwhile, in February, the Ram Mandir in Canada's Mississauga was vandalised with anti-India graffiti. In January, a Hindu temple in Brampton was defaced with anti-India graffiti, triggering outrage among the Indian community.
