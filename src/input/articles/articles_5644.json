    "title": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump receive jabs from UAW chief -- but what he said is false",
    "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump both received jabs from UAW President Shawn Fain on Wednesday — but what Fain said based on a proven to be false story from the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal reported several weeks ago that [Musk was planning to donate $45 million a month](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-45-million-monthly-pro-trump-super-pac-report/) to Trump’s new political action committee (PAC). However, both Musk and President Trump’s campaign denied the report, with Musk calling it “fake gnus.” — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) [July 16, 2024] Trump’s campaign denied that Musk would be donating $45 million a month to the former President’s bid to regain status in the White House. Nevertheless, that did not stop Fain from calling Trump a “sellout” after he switched up his tune on electric vehicles. [Trump said he “had to support” EVs](https://www.teslarati.com/trump-for-electric-cars-musk-endorsement/) because of Musk’s support, as the Tesla frontman said last month he was backing the 45th President after a failed assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. Fain said (via [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/uaw-chief-criticizes-trump-ties-musk-while-campaigning-harris-2024-08-07/)): “For months, Donald Trump has gone around trashing our state, trashing our industry, trashing the American autoworker, saying he was against electric vehicles. And then something happened…We saw Elon Musk announce he was going to give Donald Trump $45 million dollars a month. And all of a sudden, guess what, Trump changed his tune.” The UAW has already endorsed Kamala Harris for President, which is no surprise considering the union’s support from Democratic candidates, especially President Joe Biden. Musk has been highly critical of the UAW for years and has called for officials to [come hold a vote at the company’s factories](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-invites-uaw-union-vote-fremont-factory/). The UAW has not taken Musk up on his offer. I’d love to hear from you! If you have any comments, concerns, or questions, please email me at [joey@teslarati.com](mailto:joey@teslarati.com).

    "text": "\"C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h\" , a expliqué François-Xavier Bieuville lors d'une conférence de presse. Le préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans l'un des 71 centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités.\nCes centres, situés dans les établissements scolaires et gymnases, \"seront ouverts à tous\" , a-t-il assuré.\nLe cyclone Chido, qui se situe actuellement à environ 500 km au nord-est de Mayotte, est un \"cyclone tropical intense\" explique Météo-France, qui prévoit \"de violentes rafales de vents, des pluies intenses, des vagues submersives couplées à une surélévation de la mer\".\nCes conditions météorologiques fortement dégradées entraînent \"un risque de ruissellement et d'inondation, et une houle marine qui peut avoir des effets importants sur le littoral\" a ajouté François-Xavier Bieuville, qui a enjoint les bateaux à \"impérativement rejoindre la terre ferme\".\nCirculation interdite, aéroport fermé Toute circulation sur la voie publique sera interdite à partir de 22h et l'aéroport de Dzaoudzi sera fermé à partir de 20H00 (18H00 heure de Paris), a précisé le préfet.\nLa dernière barge, qui relie Dzaoudzi à Mamoudzou, partira à 17h30.\nLe ministère de l'Intérieur avait annoncé jeudi l'envoi à Mayotte de 110 professionnels de la sécurité civile depuis l'île de La Réunion. Tous les établissements scolaires de l'archipel sont fermés vendredi et samedi.\nL'archipel de Mayotte, relativement épargné par les cyclones, avait déjà été touché par le cyclone Belna en 2019, qui n'avait cependant pas fait de dégât majeur.",
