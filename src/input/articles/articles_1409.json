    "title": "Adams pal steeered city lease to mayor’s donor: sources",
    "text": "A longtime aide to Mayor Eric Adams awarded a lucrative lease to a prominent mayoral donor, reportedly overriding the results of a competitive bidding process earlier this year. Jesse Hamilton, New York’s deputy commissioner of real estate services, stepped in to give the lease to billionaire Alexander Rovt after another landlord, AmTrust Realty, had won the bidding to provide office space to the city’s Department for the Aging, several sources [told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/23/jesse-hamilton-eric-adams-city-lease-deal-donor-billionaire-00185118). Hamilton instructed his staff at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services to halt communications with AmTrust, asserting that Department for the Aging commissioner [Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorraine-cortes-vazquez-50a829a/) favored moving her agency to Rovt’s 14 Wall Street. The deal was worth tens of millions of dollars. A spokesperson for the agency referred the publication’s questions about the lease to DCAS. AmTrust Realty also declined to comment. Hamilton is a longtime pal and mentee of Adams, who was [indicted](/new-york/2024/09/26/mayor-eric-adams-indicted-on-corruption-charges/) in September on unrelated bribery charges. The city had been seeking a new location for the Department for the Aging since before Adams became mayor in 2022. The agency’s employees work across seven non-contiguous floors in a century-old building near City Hall. Rather than renovating, which the city deemed too expensive, the agency proposed moving, which brought Hamilton’s division at DCAS into the picture. That division controls 22 million square feet worth of leases with private landlords. [City procurement rules](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/mocs/downloads/Regulations/PPB/PPBRules.pdf) usually prohibit city employees from interfering when the city issues a request for proposals. It is not clear whether those rules applied to this particular transaction, and neither DCAS nor City Hall has provided clarification. Hamilton has a long history with Adams. The mayor had tapped Hamilton as his successor when he left the state Senate to run for Brooklyn borough president. Hamilton lost the seat four years later, but Adams, as mayor, hired him as a DCAS lawyer before elevating him to his current role. Hamilton is one of several mayoral officials under investigation as part of a probe into the city’s leasing of commercial properties. His phone was recently seized by the Manhattan district attorney’s office as he returned from a personal trip to Japan. Agents also confiscated the phones of several others on the trip including Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a prominent Adams adviser, and Cushman and Wakefield’s [Diana Boutross](/new-york/2024/10/11/cushman-broker-diana-boutross-phone-seized/), a commercial broker who works with DCAS on leases. It is not known if the 14 Wall Street lease is part of that investigation. A spokesperson for District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined Politico’s request for comment. Hamilton’s reported intervention in the DFTA lease benefited Rovt, a billionaire real estate investor, health care entrepreneur and longtime Adams donor. Rovt and his wife both gave the legal maximum of $3,850 to Adams’ campaigns in 2013 and 2017, while Rovt gave between $5,000 and $20,000 to a nonprofit Adams oversaw as Brooklyn borough president, according to records Politico [obtained](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2021/04/22/how-eric-adams-official-charity-boosted-his-profile-ahead-of-mayoral-run-1377468). Rovt and his son have donated a combined $3,500 to Adams’ 2025 re-election campaign. The Rovt family has also given $15,000 to Adams’ legal defense trust as federal investigators probed the mayor’s ties to Turkish diplomats and businesses. Reached by phone by Politico for comment, Rovt declined to answer questions. After Hamilton overruled the bidding, the Rovt deal went through a public review. A Manhattan community board recommended approval, but later expressed concerns after reporting by [The City](https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/10/11/adams-real-estate-jesse-hamilton-commercial-leases/) drew attention to Rovt’s ownership of the building, his past support of Adams, and Hamilton’s role overseeing leasing. On Oct. 16, a day after receiving the board’s letter, the City Planning Commission, which is controlled by the mayor, approved DFTA’s lease at 14 Wall Street. The third layer of approval could prove a harder bar for the contract to clear. The City Council has authority to call the lease up for review, and can reject it via a two-thirds majority vote.

Does real estate have his back? Council member Lincoln Restler, chair of the Council’s Committee on Governmental Operations, has scheduled a hearing next week on DCAS leasing, and [co-authored a letter ](https://www.politico.com/f/?id= 192-baf8-ddf8-a996-fefe1b090000)with fellow Council member Christopher Marte seeking more information on DCAS’ process for identifying commercial leasing opportunities. “The allegation that Jesse Hamilton unilaterally and improperly steered a lucrative city lease to a donor of the mayor is extremely disturbing,” Restler said in a statement. “New Yorkers deserve an administration free of corruption and I hope there will be a swift investigation by appropriate authorities that leads to real accountability.” — Caroline Handel",

    "text": "feel good [Peter Barr](/news/peter-barr/102158484)and [John Dobson](/news/john-dobson/10964032) In short: A \"whale orgy\" off southern WA south highlights the unusual breeding behaviour of the mammals. Southern right whales often breed in groups of up to 20 in waters off the Australian coast. What's next? Mating is a promising sign for whale species still recovering from decades of whaling. A mating frenzy captured on camera off Western Australia's south coast is a promising sign for southern right numbers still recovering from decades of whaling, according to a marine biologist. The footage shot by Albany resident Brett Peake shows a group of about six to seven whales mating in a group. Marine biologist Pia Markovic says the mating ritual is more common in southern rights than other whale species. \"You could have five whales there or you could have up to 20 whales,\" she said. \"They look to be rolling over each other and rubbing up against each other, which is pretty typical of whale sex.\" Mating led by female of species Mating can start with a female southern right putting out a call which travels underwater, Ms Markovich said. \"The males will hear that and they'll swim over and, basically, a whale orgy starts,\" she said. \"It's almost like a dance when there's physical stamina, they're agile and it's quite graceful actually.\" Ms Markovic said the female would lead, with the male \"mirroring\" her movements. It can lead to male whales fighting for attention. \"The males will push and shove, but it's relatively non-violent and they kind of just bump into each other like bumper cars,\" she said. Mating before migration south Multiple males will mate with one female, creating the best chance of impregnation. Ms Markovic said southern right whales had the largest testicles of any animal on earth. \"They can weigh up to 500kg each, so they have one tonne of testicles that are inside their body,\" she said. The whales migrate along WA’s west coast and can breed in waters from Exmouth to the South Australian border before heading to sub-Antarctic waters. Population rebounding from whaling The southern right population was estimated to be 50,000 to 70,000 in the 1700s, before whaling decimated the population. There were fewer than 300 whales left in the 1920s, according to WWF Australia. The most recent estimate has the population sitting at 3,000 or so. Albany was the last commercial whaling operation in Australia until its closure in 1978. Scientists are tracking southern rights through calcified skin markings on their heads and the population is slowly rebounding from whaling. \"It's a lot less than the original pre-whaling numbers,\" Ms Markovic said. \"But by mapping these individuals, scientists are seeing an increase about five or six per cent each year, which is fantastic.\" ABC Great Southern — local news in your inbox ABC Privacy Collection Statement .",

    "text": "POLSON — A separate pair of firearms incidents are being investigated in Polson, one involving gunfire and another a burglary. Law enforcement responded to the Apostolic United Pentecost Church building on 8th Avenue West on December 21, 2023, for reports that gunfire had hit the building. Polson Police Chief George Simpson says officers confirmed the building — which was occupied at the time — had been hit by gunfire. No injuries were reported. The second incident happened on Christmas Day when Polson officers responded to a burglary alarm at the Depoe Junction pawn shop on Kari Lane. The front doors appeared to have been forced open by a vehicle and the business owner reported that several firearms had been stolen. Chief Simpson says a vehicle used in the theft was later recovered by the CSKT Tribal Police outside of Polson and that guns were found inside the vehicle. Anyone with information about either case is asked to call 406-883-8211 and speak with Captain Mathieu Gfroerer. Information can also be emailed to [mgfroerer@cityofpolson.com](mailto:mgfroerer@cityofpolson.com). “Any incident involving gun violence, religious institutions, or firearm theft is of the utmost importance to us and we will continue to vigorously investigate these cases with our law enforcement partners and every resource available to us,” Chief Simpson stated. Chief Simpson says both investigations are ongoing and no further information is being released at this time.",

    "text": "Share\n\"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.\" (1 Corinthians 15:33)\nI remember a night several years ago when I was reading through our family Bible with my children. My oldest son suddenly asked a question that left me speechless: \"Dad, why do people say Billy Graham was such a great preacher if he didn’t preach the true Gospel?\"\nOut of the mouths of babes comes wisdom that cuts straight to the bone.\nThe Uncomfortable Reality of Graham's Legacy\nSeven years have passed since Billy Graham's death, and while the world still venerates him as America's preacher, it's time we face some hard truths. As a Bible teacher and someone who believes in rightly dividing the word of truth, I've spent years studying the fruit of Graham's ministry. What I've found might shock you.\n1. The Descent into Universalism\nGraham's latter years revealed a troubling shift toward universalism. In a stunning 1997 interview with Robert Schuller, Graham claimed even Muslims and atheists could be part of the Body of Christ without knowing Jesus's name. This flies directly in the face of our Lord's words: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" (John 14:6)\n2. The Finney Factor\nLike Charles Finney before him, Graham popularized the \"altar call\" methodology. Having witnessed countless altar calls myself, I can tell you: walking an aisle and muttering a prayer doesn't equal salvation. True conversion requires godly sorrow and repentance.\n3. The Political Compromise\nDespite his public image, Graham was a lifelong Democrat who defended abortion in cases of rape and incest. As a father of five, I cannot fathom justifying the taking of innocent life for any reason.\n4. The Watered-Down Gospel\nGraham emerged from fundamentalism only to create a diluted version of evangelicalism that pleased the world but grieved the Spirit. Godly men like Martin Lloyd-Jones and Ian Paisley opposed him for good reason.\n5. The Globalist Agenda\nFew know that Graham was instrumental in pushing for a one-world religion through the World Council on World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland. This should alarm any Bible-believing Christian.\n6. The Modern Legacy\nToday, the evangelicals who admire him most and run institutions bearing his name represent the most liberal wing of Christianity. The Billy Graham Association even started Christianity Today, which has become a voice for compromised doctrine.\n7. The Fruit Test\n\"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20). Post-mortem studies of Graham's crusades reveal a sobering truth: very few \"converts\" showed lasting fruit of salvation through church membership, baptism, or continued faith.\nWhy This Matters Now More Than Ever\nAs I drive my garbage route through rural North Dakota each morning, I see churches filled with people who've been lulled into a false sense of security by watered-down gospel messages. They're spiritual descendants of Graham's compromised evangelicalism.\nThe TRUE gospel demands:\n- Belief in Jesus as the ONLY way of salvation\n- Genuine repentance from sin\n- Rejection of all false means of salvation\n- Trust in Christ alone, not in works\nA Call to Action\nBrothers and sisters, it's time to:\n1. Return to the pure, uncompromised Word of God\n2. Reject the world's approval-seeking Christianity\n3. Stand firm on biblical truth, even when it costs us\nRemember, \"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat\" (Matthew 7:13).\nWill you stand with truth, or continue down the broad way of compromise?\nShare\nThe Biblical Man is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\nSubscribe\nIf this article stirred your spirit, share it with your congregation.
