    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "“Antonio García podrá decir hasta misa, pero diálogos de paz son una realidad”: gobernador de Nariño - BluRadio",
    "text": "En una enérgica respuesta al jefe del comando central del [ELN,](https://www.bluradio.com/regiones/antioquia/dos-muertos-dejo-enfrentamientos-entre-clan-del-golfo-y-el-eln-en-el-bajo-cauca-antioqueno-rg10) alias ' [Antonio García'](https://www.bluradio.com/nacion/otty-patino-a-alias-antonio-garcia-es-un-jefe-del-eln-el-que-dice-eso-pero-quien-le-cree-rg10), el gobernador de Nariño, Luis Alfonso Escobar, se refirió a los diálogos sociales de paz que se llevan a cabo en el departamento y dijo que van más allá de logar disminuir la violencia en la región. Asimismo, aseguró que el jefe del ELN podrá decir \"hasta misa\", pero lo que la gente quiere ver \"es inversión social en sus veredas, corregimientos y municipios azotados por las confrontaciones entre grupos armados ilegales”. A pesar que estos diálogos han sido cuestionados por el comando central, el jefe de la administración seccional dijo a Blu Radio que estos diálogos sociales no pueden interpretarse como una estrategia para dividir al ELN, ni su intención es entorpecer en ningún momento las conversaciones de paz que adelanta el [Gobierno nacional](https://www.bluradio.com/nacion/gobierno-reduce-meta-de-erradicacion-de-cultivos-ilicitos-para-2024-frente-a-2023-10-000-hectareas-rg10) con la guerrilla y las disidencias de la Farc del Estado Mayor Central, como lo han querido hacer ver los enemigos de la paz. Señaló que este es el primer encuentro de este tipo que se desarrolla en el marco de la política de Paz Total del Gobierno del presidente [Gustavo Petro](https://www.bluradio.com/regiones/bogota/presidente-petro-rechaza-intervencion-del-esmad-en-la-plaza-de-bolivar-por-marcha-del-8m-rs15) y debe recibir el apoyo de toda la comunidad. Hablar de paz es hablar de estabilidad en múltiples dimensiones: estabilidad laboral, social y, fundamentalmente, estabilidad psicológica. La paz no es solo la ausencia de conflictos armados, sino un tejido que involucra el bienestar integral de la sociedad Publicidad Del mismo modo, Escobar afirmó a Blu Radio radio que lo que más importa en el territorio, más que hablar, es hacer. \"Y lo que se está viendo en Nariño es el liderazgo de un gobernador y un presidente de la República con todo su gabinete ordenando toda la inversión histórica que nunca se ha visto en territorios como estos y eso es la paz\", sostuvo el mandatario seccional. A su vez, pidió al Gobierno que se discuta en la mesa de diálogos con el ELN y el Estado Mayor Central de las disidencias de las Farc la posibilidad que haya un cese multilateral de hostilidades y confió que tras el inicio de los diálogos sociales de paz las comunidades desplazadas puedan retornar a sus territorios sin temor alguno. Publicidad “Yo lo he dicho: una cosa es dialogar a nivel nacional con los grupos armados ilegales y hacer un cese bilateral de fuego, pero en los territorios la realidad es distinta, porque esos actores armados vuelven y mueven la guerra según su posición siguiendo las rentas ilícitas, a través del tráfico de drogas y la minería ilegal\", dijo. Advirtió que lo más importante es recuperar la confianza de las comunidades que ya cumplen más de ocho meses en situación de desplazamiento y otras más en confinamiento en el sector del resguardo indígena del Sandé, La Montaña y otras zonas del departamento. Indicó Escobar que con recursos que superan los 237.000 millones de pesos, las inversiones para esta subregión estarán destinadas, entre otros proyectos a: - Mejoramiento en el acceso a la asistencia en salud: construcción y dotación de centros de salud en zona rural, un hospital de segundo nivel y vehículos de transporte. - Accesos y oportunidades en educación: construcción de tres instituciones educativas, mejoras estructurales para 25 colegios y la ciudadela de educación superior. - Calidad y ampliación de procesos en materia de saneamiento básico: construcción de unidades sanitarias con tratamiento de aguas, programa de agua y bienestar para las veredas, y mejoramiento en los sistemas de acueducto. - Progreso y conectividad en planes de infraestructura: pavimentación de la vía entre Samaniego y Santacruz de Guachavés, adecuación de vías terciarias y dotación de kits de maquinaria.",

About 95% victims do not survive due to minimal public awareness and knowledge on how to handle such emergencies,\\\" said Prof Kapoor.Adding that a delay of a single minute could decrease chances of survival by 10%, he added that if the public was made aware of how to perform CPR, they could help save lives.Principal secretary Alok Kumar told reporters that hands-on training included key tips on how to recognise sudden cardiac arrest besides the technique of CPR. \\\"The expert spoke about using lifesaving device called automated external defibrillator (AED), besides taking questions on cardiac health,\\\" said Kumar.",

    "text": "TUKWILA, Wash. — Whether you're a frequent or a first-time flyer,\nAlaska Airlines always wants you to have a good flight. One of the ways they do this is by rotating the food and drinks passengers eat once onboard.\n\"We like to keep things fresh. We like to make sure that our guests have various rotations throughout the year that they can pick from for our repeat travelers that they're not getting the same thing,\" said Jessica Johnston, Food and Beverage manager for Alaska Airlines. \"We really put a focus on making sure that we're partnering with small West Coast companies, whether it be Browne or anything else up and down the West Coast.\"\nOne of those local partners is\nBrowne Family Vineyards out of Walla Walla. Hal Landvoigt from Browne has been with the company from the beginning.\n\"Our first year, 2003, Andrew and I in the cellar put together a 400-case cabernet blend and we've grown since then tremendously,\" Landvoigt said. \"We're the largest family-owned winery in Washington state.\"\nAlaska Airlines is now featuring two of Browne's wines on their flights.\n\"The Chardonnay is the white wine. Chardonnay is obviously the most popular grape in the world so one of the world's most popular wines,” Landvoigt. \"The red is a Syrah and merlot red blend. So, two grapes that have done really well in Washington since the beginning of Washington vivaculture.\nIf you'd like a meal with your wine, Alaska has something new on its menu.\n\"A couple of new dishes we're excited about are the chicken served in the cilantro lime rice, with fried plantains, and the delicious jerk sauce. We also have our Mediterranean lentils. This is our vegan and gluten-free option this year. Lentils on the bottom sitting on top of cauliflower and marinated roasted grilled onions and red peppers,\" Johnston said.\nWhich wine goes best with your in-flight meal?\n\"So, the jerk chicken that I mentioned, would go well with a generation Chardonnay, and then the Mediterranean lentils we would certainly pair with the red blend.\"\nSo, if you love good wine and good food, you'll find both up in the sky.\n\"Whether it is the beginning of a business trip for them or the beginning of a vacation that they saved for a lifetime to take. It's exciting to keep things fresh for our guests,\" Johnston said.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",

    "text": "In devastating news for Snoop Dogg, Bill Maher, and Kamala Harris, a study carried out by researchers in Australia indicates a \"genotoxic\" connection between cannabis use and genetic damage that is behind rising rates of cancers and other health issues, such as birth defects and accelerated aging.\nI'll define \"genotoxic%3A%20genotoxicity,birth%20defects%20(inheritable%20damage).)\" for you:\nToxic (damaging) to DNA. Substances that are genotoxic may bind directly to DNA or act indirectly leading to DNA damage by affecting enzymes involved in DNA replication, thereby causing mutations which may or may not lead to cancer or birth defects.\nSo yeah...\nThe study was carried out by researchers at the University of Western Australia, and was published in Addiction Biology. According to their findings, exposure to cannabis was associated with a range of cancers - breast, pancreatic, liver, thyroid, testicular and lymphoma - that also develop quickly and are more aggressive.\nIn addition, links to birth defects were found, indicating that cannabis use could cause DNA mutations that pass on to children in utero.\n\"The link we've described between cannabis use and genotoxicity has far-reaching consequences,\" said Stuart Reece of the University of Western Australia, a co-author of the study. \"This new research shows how genetic damage from cannabis use can be passed down the generations.\"\nRecreational marijuana use is legal in 24 states, 3 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.\nWhile support for further legalization is gaining momentum, Reece added that he hopes the analysis \"reframes the discussion surrounding cannabis legalization from a personal choice to one that potentially involves multiple subsequent generations.\"\nFollow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).\nP.S.

[RELATED: New Year’s Eve revellers urged to wrap up warm as temperatures plummet](https://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/national/24016879.new-years-eve-revellers-urged-wrap-warm-temperatures-plummet/) The latest forecast from the Met Office says: “An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. “Gusts of 45-50mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75mph in places.” What should I do to prepare? The Met Office has suggested anyone living in the affected area should prepare in advance for power cuts. It said: “It’s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items. “If you are on the coast, stay safe during stormy weather by being aware of large waves. Even from the shore large breaking waves can sweep you off your feet and out to sea. “Take care if walking near cliffs; know your route and keep dogs on a lead. In an emergency, call 999 and ask for the coastguard.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
