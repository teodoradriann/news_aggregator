    "text": "A survey released on Thursday found that a majority of Americans oppose unconditional aid to Ukraine and believe that the country cannot defeat Russia.\nDefense Priorities, a noninterventionist think tank, commissioned YouGov to poll Americans about the Ukraine-Russia war, escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, and Israel’s conflict with its neighbors.\nThe survey found that 80 percent of respondents believe that American should either make aid to Ukraine conditional (45 percent), reduce aid to Ukraine (14 percent), or should not send any aid to Ukraine (21 percent).\nFifty-two percent of respondents said that they do not believe that Ukraine can win the war against Russia, while 48 percent believe that result is still possible.\nForty-two percent of Americans said that they believe the over-three-year conflict will end with a negotiated ceasefire, 26 percent said that there would be ongoing trench warfare that may stall or slow down, 13 percent said that the Russia military will collapse, 12 percent said that the Ukrainian military would collapse, and seven percent had another response.\nSixty-one percent of respondents said that America does not have a strategy for the Ukraine-Russia war, while 39 percent said that it does.\nAlthough the Biden-Harris administration has yet to adopt a formal strategy towards the protracted Ukraine-Russia conflict, the Biden-Harris State Department told Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) that Ukraine’s victory is “necessary.”\nForty-six percent of respondents said that NATO countries should not send soldiers to Ukraine, as that could act as a “tripwire that leads to direct NATO-Russia conflict.”\nA plurality of Americans, or 47 percent, agree that the U.S. should not allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with American-provided arms as “it could escalate the war and lead to direct NATO-Russian conflict.”\nDefense Priorities commissioned YouGov to conduct the survey, which polled 1,176 American adults.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said in early August that the foreign policy vision espoused by former President Donald Trump and Sen.

    "title": "Michael Oren reveals images show liberation of Buchenwald concentration camp",
    "text": "World War II holds a significant place in the family story of the former Israeli ambassador to the United States and Knesset member Dr. Michael Oren. His father, Lester, enlisted in the U.S. Army and fought in the war alongside his three brothers. Michael's uncle, Joe, also participated in liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp. Both his father and uncle documented what they saw in various places where they fought. Joe's photos from Buchenwald depict the horrifying aftermath of Nazi crimes, prompting Michael Oren to share them with the world. Rare photos reveal piles of Jewish bodies, a haunting sight for Orenl. \"My uncle never recovered from it; he suffered from depression all his life. It also affected the soldiers; they couldn't comprehend it,\" Orenl recounts in a special interview with Ynet. \"Especially as Jewish soldiers. My father and uncle spoke Yiddish and talked to the survivors, but they couldn't process it. But my father didn't succumb to depression. He was incredibly brave, a staunch Zionist, and raised me as one. He took it to another place, and I loved that place, responding to horrors with strength, not surrender,\" he said. Oren talks about the antisemitism he experienced growing up in the U.S. and the lesson he learned from his father. \"I grew up in a non-Jewish area; we were the only Jewish family in the neighborhood. Every day I faced taunts like 'You killed Jesus' and would come home at age 8 or 9 with a black eye. My father would open the album and show me the toughest pictures of piles of bodies, with shocked soldiers standing by, and he would say to me: 'Do you see this, son? This is why we need a strong Jewish state.' In those words.\" \"That message influenced me immediately. At that moment, I decided to make aliyah to Israel. I went to volunteer on a kibbutz and served as a lone soldier in the paratroopers, fought in Israel's wars, became an emissary to the Zionist underground in the Soviet Union, and later became the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and a member of the Knesset.\" Even today, these images still haunt him. \"At night, I protect Israel against international media outlets, and I carry these images on my mobile phone. When I'm interviewed sometimes in tough, aggressive interviews on BBC, MSNBC and CNN, these images are right in front of my eyes.\" These are chilling images. Why did you decide to expose them now? \"Because it's part of our story. Especially in the wake of the horrors of October 7th and, by the way, there's no comparison. We experienced for several hours what it means to be without a country, and here the country has returned to itself – and unlike the Holocaust where 25,000 Jews were murdered every day in Auschwitz, today we have a strong state. Especially this morning, as we remind ourselves and the world ahead of the likely entry of the IDF into Rafah – the most necessary thing is to remember why we need a strong Jewish state.\" Courage under fire Oren's grandparents immigrated to the United States in the early 1920s. His father and mother, whose mother tongue was Yiddish, grew up in Boston and assimilated into America. After the outbreak of World War II, Michael Oren's father, Lester, enlisted in the U.S. Army with his three brothers, served in combat engineering, and was sent to England during the preparations for the Normandy invasion. Later, he landed in Normandy and fought there. In the days that followed, he received two medals of valor from the U.S. Army and one medal of valor from the French government for his actions in the war. In December 1944, when it seemed that the war was nearing its end, the German army launched a surprise attack – the Battle of the Bulge – which caught the Americans off guard. Oren's father was then in Belgium with his unit, and the German army planned to reach that area as well. His unit decided to stay and fight, even though tens of thousands of American soldiers surrendered. Together with another American soldier, Lester hid in a pit dug on the side of the road, and he saw with his own eyes the German army approaching. As the German army approached his hiding place, Lester shot at a tree with a rocket launcher, causing the tree's branches to fall into the pit, thus hiding him from the Germans. The soldier with him in the pit fired a rocket at the first German tank in the approaching convoy at a range of 10 meters, the tank caught fire and blocked the entire convoy, so the German convoy decided to retreat. Oren's father, who knew Yiddish and therefore understood some German words, heard the German commander order the retreat. As the German convoy was preparing to retreat, he pulled out the grenade he was holding. He realized that if he threw the grenade outside the hiding place, he might expose their hiding place. Therefore, for an entire night, he held the grenade in his hand until he found a nail and neutralized it. The war continued, and in March 1945, the American army invaded Germany. During the invasion, there was a need to cross the Rhine River. Lester was given command of a motorboat. When the boat under his command reached the middle of the river, the Germans opened heavy fire toward them. Oren's father survived and even managed to cross the river four times back and forth under fire. Between Biden and Rafah Today, Lester's son, Michael Oren, stands at the forefront of Israel's public relations, and in various interviews, he emphasizes Israel's right to defend itself against its enemies. How do you feel about attempting to portray the war in the Gaza Strip as a 'massacre' or to compare it to what happened in the Holocaust? \"In interviews, they try to restrain themselves because interviewers want to bias the interviewee. I don't give them that triumph. I explain: 'Who is responsible for the massacre in the Gaza Strip? Not Israel, but rather the terrorists who use the civilian population as human shields, while the IDF does everything possible to minimize civilian casualties.' According to historical measures, because I am also a historian by background, there hasn't been a war since World War II with such a low proportion between the terrorists killed and the civilians affected. In Gaza, it's one-to-one. When Americans fought in Afghanistan and Syria, the ratio was 1 to 9.\" You talked about a strong Jewish state, and the question is whether a strong Jewish state can stand alone. At the Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony, the prime minister made very strong statements, but ones that place us as those who can cope alone. Can we cope alone, without the US? \"It's always better to act with the U.S. and to go as much as possible toward President Biden, who is a friend, I know him and have spoken with him for years. Also, the entire staff and the Secretary of State are pro-Israel. They have their interests that don't always align with ours.\" Are we likely to lose the Americans in another decade? Especially after the pictures we saw in universities, especially at Columbia, which you know well? \"I am a graduate of Columbia University. I am not a prophet. I know there are ups and downs, but it's a historical alliance based on shared democratic values and also strategic interests. Beyond that, there is a spiritual connection between the American and Israeli people; the U.S. is still a very religious country, and people read the Bible and draw conclusions. We can allow ourselves to reach some tension with the U.S., but we must not pay the price of giving up our vital security interests.\"",

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "BENGALURU, Dec 29: The Save Sharda Committee (SSC) here on Friday sought the help of the Indian government to remove the ”encroachment by the Pakistan Army” on the Sharda temple premises in Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), in order to pave way for its restoration. Addressing a press conference at Press Club of Bangalore, SSC founder Ravinder Pandita alleged that the Pakistan army had encroached upon the dilapidated old Sharda temple premises and opened a coffee home there despite a court order in the committee’s favour. “Save Sharda Committee requests the Government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to raise the issue of encroachments and removal of a coffee home recently erected on Sharda Peeth premises by the Pakistan army. This is despite the Supreme Court of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir’s landmark judgment on January 3, 2023 pronounced in favour of Save Sharda Committee based on its representation seeking to stop encroachments,” he said. He added that civil society in PoJK has also raised their voice in tandem with SSC on this issue as well as about the damages to the boundary wall. Pandita demanded that Sharda Peeth be reopened for devotees to go on pilgrimage. ”We will give a call for a march to the LoC and cross it if the coffee home is not removed by Pakistan authorities and its army. All Sharda supporters should be ready for this march in the near future,” he said. He also called for Sharda Peeth to be declared a UNESCO heritage site. The SSC founder told reporters that a website has been launched with the aim of providing complete information and a travel guide for pilgrims and tourists on the newly reconstructed Sharda temple at Teetwal and a Sikh gurudwara that stood at the same place before 1947 but was burnt down in tribal raids. The construction of the new Sharda Yatra Temple at Teetwal in Kashmir, which was virtually inaugurated on March 22 by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, was supported by the Dakshinamnaya Sringeri Mutt in Karnataka. Teetwal, where the temple has been built now, was the historic base camp for devotees who would go to Goddess Sharda’s shrine before partition, according to reports. Nearly 10,000 pilgrims have visited the new Sharda Yatra temple and gurudwara since its inauguration in March this year.

    "title": "Here’s How Johnson’s Jigsaw Puzzle of a Foreign Aid Plan Would Work",
    "text": "The House is set to vote this weekend on a foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that has been stalled for months.\nSimilar legislation passed the Senate in February with bipartisan support, but, in order to steer around opposition from members of his own party, Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, is using a convoluted plan: It breaks that package down into three pieces, adds a fourth bill to sweeten the deal and then melds them back together again.\nThe strategy is designed to capitalize on the distinct bases of political support for the various pieces of the foreign aid package, worth $95.3 billion, without allowing opposition to any one element defeat the whole thing. Mr. Johnson regards it as a necessity given his vanishingly slim majority and the large number of Republicans who staunchly oppose sending aid to Ukraine.\nHe will need to rely on support from Democrats not only to win passage of the funding for Kyiv, but also to prevail on a procedural vote needed to bring the package to the floor. On Thursday, Mr. Johnson was working to get that procedural measure through the House Rules Committee, where three Republicans have said they will block it, meaning that Democratic support would be needed just to get it out of committee.\nHere’s how Mr. Johnson’s plan would work:\nAn all-or-nothing procedural measure is the first vote\nThe first vote, and most crucial, on the package will happen before the aid ever comes to the floor. It will be on a measure known as a rule that is usually a routine procedural step, almost always taken along party lines, laying out how the debate and voting will go. But in this case, Mr. Johnson will need Democrats to vote for it because right-wing Republicans are vehemently opposed.\nThe rule is expected to allow for debate and separate votes on each of the four pieces of the package and then, should all of them pass, wrap them together into one bill. That means that the House would never actually hold an up-or-down vote on the entire aid package.\nThe maneuver effectively decouples aid for Israel and Ukraine on the House floor without actually breaking the two apart. It would allow lawmakers who strongly back aid to Israel — most Republicans and Democrats — to vote in favor of that piece of the package. At the same time, those who oppose aid to Ukraine — as many right-wing Republicans do — would be able to do so.\nBackers of the funding for Kyiv, including most Democrats and many mainstream Republicans, could support that bill while voting against aid to Israel, as some progressive Democrats may do.\nThe strategy sets up an all-or-nothing vote on the rule that lawmakers will face before considering any one piece of the aid package, creating a procedural hurdle almost as important as the legislation itself.\n$60.8 billion for Ukraine\nMilitary funding for Ukraine makes up the largest bill in the package, totaling $60.8 billion. A sizable amount is set aside to “replenish American defense stockpiles” and it grants billions for the purchase of U.S. defense systems, which Ukrainian officials for months have said are badly needed.\nThe bill closely mirrors the Senate package, but it adds a requirement for the Biden administration to send more American-made missiles known as long-range ATACMS to Kyiv. The United States has\npreviously supplied Ukraine with a cluster-munition version of the missiles, but only after President Biden overcame his longstanding reluctance to providing the weapons and permitted the Pentagon to deliver them covertly.\nIt also would direct the president to seek repayment of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who has pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\n$26.4 billion for Israel and aid for Palestinians\nThe bill would send roughly $15 billion in military aid to Israel as the country continues its offensive against Hamas and weighs a response to attacks from Iran. It prioritizes defensive capabilities, providing more than $5 billion to replenish the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. An additional $2.4 billion is directed to current U.S. military operations in the region.\nAnother $9 billion would go to “worldwide humanitarian aid,” including for civilians in Gaza. Like the Senate bill, this package would bar funding from going to UNRWA, the main United Nations agency that provides aid to Palestinians in Gaza. The package does not include any conditions on military aid, a sticking point for a growing number of Democrats who have become more vocal in their calls to force the Israeli government to modify their military tactics in Gaza.\n$8 billion for Taiwan and other allies\nA third bill would provide $8 billion of aid for Taiwan to counter China. The House bill would allow the Pentagon to quickly provide Taiwan with more offensive weapons and provides billions more for the purchase of advance U.S. weapons technology as the U.S. and Taiwanese governments continue to build up their alliances to deter China from launching an invasion.\nA sweetener bill\nA fourth measure includes several Republican priorities that Mr. Johnson cobbled together to draw more support within his own party for the aid package.\nOne piece would redirect funds from seized Russian assets to offset American aid to Ukraine. Republicans who back the plan say it will ensure that Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, is held financially accountable for the war.\nAmerican allies, including France and Germany, have been skeptical about the viability of such a move under international law. They have instead been pushing for a solution that uses the proceeds on the interest from the nearly $300 billion of frozen Russian assets to give to Ukraine directly, either in the form of loans or as collateral to borrow money.\nThe bill also would impose sanctions on Iranian and Russian officials and further limit the export of U.S. technology used to make Iranian drones.\nAnd it includes legislation that would\nforce the parent company of TikTok, the popular social media app, to sell the platform or face a ban in the United States. It mirrors a bill that the House passed last month. But it includes an option to extend the deadline for a sale to nine months from the original six, and it would allow the president to extend it for another 90 days if progress toward a sale was being made.\nThe post\n Here’s How Johnson’s Jigsaw Puzzle of a Foreign Aid Plan Would Work appeared first on New York Times.",
