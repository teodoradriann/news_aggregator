    "text": "In the Valle de Belìce, an hour southwest of Palermo, agronomist Daniele Asaro scrambles up a slope to check on Francesco Ragona’s vineyards. He likes what he sees. With Asaro’s encouragement, Ragona, a fourth-generation grower, was transitioning his property to be certified organic. Asaro lingers over the Catarratto, an indigenous white grape that, at these mountain altitudes, gains the acidity to balance its natural richness. “We’re conducting a high-elevation project,” he says. “Anyone growing Catarratto from 350 meters to 600 meters up can participate.” The intent of the research, and all of Asaro’s work, is to improve grape quality, and as a result, increase profits for the growers that comprise his employer, Cantine Ermes . This part of Sicily depends on their success.\nCantine Ermes’ vineyards in the Belìce Valley. | Photos by Luca Savettiere\nIn America, where we romanticize independence, and thus independent winemakers, we tend to belittle cooperatives, thinking of them as just bulk wine producers. But Italy’s cooperatives make more than half of the country’s wine, much of it offering quality and value. Seventy percent of Cantine Ermes’ output is indeed bulk, vinified in towering tanks. But the rest goes to labels like Vento di Mare BIO, a line of fresh, young, organic wines—briny, jasmine-tea Grillo; berry-and-earth Nerello Mascalese—named for the sea breeze that brings fog and chilly nights to quench and cool dry-farmed grapes like Ragona’s.\nMore importantly for their regions, cooperatives are socioeconomic engines, born of the need to pool resources during scarcity.\nMore importantly for their regions, cooperatives are socioeconomic engines, born of the need to pool resources during scarcity. This is poignantly true of Cantine Ermes. With 2,513 growers farming 33,720 acres in Veneto, Puglia, and throughout Sicily, the co-op has grown in its quarter-century into a multi-regional force. But its past and future are linked to what its marketers call “the wounded heart” of the Valle de Belìce.\nNear Ragona’s vineyards is the scar of that wound: Il Grande Cretto (The Great Crack). A five-foot-tall maze of shimmering concrete spread across 24 hillside acres, the Cretto follows former streets, its walls encasing ruins. The artist Alberto Burri created it to both erase and commemorate the town of Gibellina, leveled by an earthquake in 1968, when Salvatore Sutera was 8 years old. “First, there was shaking. My mother had pasta on the stove, and the kitchen wall was moving,” recalls Sutera, mayor of the old town’s contemporary namesake. “We fled, and that night, Gibellina fell.”\nSurvivors lived 14 years in temporary housing while red tape, corruption, and Mafia meddling stalled construction of Gibellina Nuova, 20 kilometers away. Finally, Sutera’s late predecessor, the charismatic Ludovico Corrao, took matters into his own hands, persuading a host of international artists and architects to build the new town as a monumental, plein air museum. Today, in a municipality of 5,000 people, there are two major museums, an important theater festival, and 67 large-scale artworks, including landmark Brutalist buildings, some left incomplete. Upkeep of it all, Sutera attests, takes resources. That’s where Cantine Ermes comes in.\n“After the earthquake, many people left the area. One thing that brought them back was the possibility of this new reality, the cooperative, that allowed them to start anew.”—Rosario DiMaria\n“It’s in my DNA, the earthquake,” says Rosario DiMaria, president of the cooperative, whose flagship—a spicy Nero d’Alva Riserva with balsamic undertones—is named for the disaster’s ground zero: Epicentro . One of nine young winemakers who banded together for the recovery of their region, Di Maria co-founded Cantine Ermes in 1998. “After the earthquake, many people left the area. One thing that brought them back was the possibility of this new reality, the cooperative, that allowed them to start anew.”\nCantine Ermes grew rapidly, taking in growers in locations where other cooperatives had failed. In 2008, it expanded to Veneto, and in 2018 it acquired Cantinadella Riforma Fondiaria in Puglia. “But our focus stays in Sicily. That’s where Cantine Ermes does all its work apart from the wine,” says Di Maria. As the largest employer in the area with more than 100 employees and thousands of winegrowers, “we have responsibility for our growers but also our neighbors.”\n(Left) Il Grande Cretto (The Great Crack), created by artist Alberto Burri, encasing the ruins of the town of Gibellina. | Photo by Artlouder; (Right) La Montagna di Sale (The Salt Mountain), a sculpture by Mimmo Paladino, at Gibellina Nuova. | Photo by Luca Savettiere\nThe cooperative underwrote local art restoration and overhauled the foundation that oversees the works. It supports the museums and theater festival, it operates the city’s botanical garden, and in 2017, it launched the Scirocco Wine Fest, bringing poets and writers, chefs, and producers from throughout the Mediterranean to town. When Covid halted the event, the co-op gathered Moscato vines from seven countries and, in Gibellinese fashion, planted them artistically in a semi-circle radiating from a central core, symbolizing the Mediterranean’s shared viticultural heritage. Visitors to Tenuta Oriestiadi experience Cantine Ermes’ integration of Gibellinas new and old. Set within a restored baglio, a historic Sicilian walled farmhouse, the co-op’s winery houses a barrique museum, where artworks are displayed on the heads of barrels. Tasting tours include trips to the museums and Il Grande Cretto.\nAs Asaro and other agronomists make their rounds to members’ vineyards, helping ensure ever-better vintages, the cooperative’s civic work is ongoing. “We have done a lot of projects together,” says Sutera, “but the earthquake was just 55 years ago.” Recovery takes generations. “Gibellina has artworks but no infrastructure to host tourists. Without that, we don’t have a lot of work here, and young people are leaving. So the cooperative that grew up here and needs more employees year after year is working with the city on a tourism plan to create opportunities in Gibellina.”\nDi Maria concurs. “The project of Cantine Ermes is to have this strong link between wine and territory, and that’s something that can make a difference.”",

    "title": "Led by ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,’ September Box Office Wants to Pick Up Where Summer Left Off",
    "text": "September should accomplish something that summer 2024 did not , although it made a valiant effort. Box office should improve against last September by at least $200 million, with the potential for a $700 million total. If that’s the case, summer will deserve some credit for providing a strong baseline.\nOn the surface, it’s not a good look. Summer 2024 was 10 percent lower than last year — a period that, with unadjusted ticket prices, was the lowest-grossing pre-Covid summer in this century. May and June were down 15 percent from 2023, but July and August fell only five percent thanks to “Deadpool vs. Wolverine” (Disney), this summer’s big Marvel release.\nYes, 2024 was the first summer after the strikes, but 2023 and 2024 were about the same in major wide releases — a little more than 30. This year saw two $600 million+ releases (Disney with “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool”), compared to one last year (“Barbie”). Both 2024 hits ultimately grossed more than Greta Gerwig’s smash.\nEven with summer’s underperformance, it was enough to slash the year-to-date comparison to less than 15 percent. At the end of April, that decline was a catastrophic 22 percent. That leaves the next four months to do the heavy lifting, with September setting the standard.\n“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” (Warner Bros.) and “Transformers One” (Paramount), likely to be the month’s two biggest grossers, both exemplify formulas that were critical this summer. They build on previous successes while feeling fresh rather than derivative.\nTim Burton’s sequel to his 1988 hit hopes to continue the summer trend of top franchise titles improving on previous results. (Adjusted to current prices, the original grossed about $250 million domestic.) It should open to $100 million or more this weekend in the U.S./Canada, helped by access to higher-price premium screens.\nSomething that separated summer 2024 from the prior year was fewer titles budgeted over $150 million, improving the chance for studio profit. The “Beetlejuice” sequel cost $100 million and, based on pre-release projections, it might follow the summer trend of struggling for foreign returns .\n‘Transformers One’ ©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection “Transformers One” (September 19) hits the sweet spot for animation that also elevated the summer, representing about one third of the summer’s total (around $1.2 billion). It should be the month’s second-biggest opener with the potential for $50 million and a strong multiple. Universal’s animated “The Wild Robot” (September 26) is an original and trickier to project. It premieres at Toronto in a few days. It might also have a shot at a $20 million start.\nLed by “Inside Out 2” and “Despicable Me 4,” this summer saw an unusually high number of top films gross more than three times their opening weekends . This suggests an increasingly viable mutual existence with PVOD releases.\n‘Longlegs’ NEON Blumhouse’s “Speak No Evil” (Universal) also has a shot at a $20 million opening. Horror was a significant summer contributor with about $500 million, led by Paramount’s “A Quiet Place: Day One.” Horror has become more mainstream, with inventive original efforts like Neon’s “Longlegs” getting the benefit.\nSomething missing from September is Disney. That studio returned to summer dominance with over $1.5 billion in domestic gross. Its return is good for the industry, but it’s also good to see other companies sustain a month.\nAbout a dozen other wide releases, including several from independents, could surprise, including some event releases from Fathom. Summer holdovers like “Deadpool,” Alien: Romulus,” “Twisters,” “Reagan,” and more could add as much as $150 million to the total, all increasing the chances of $700 million or more. That would take year-over-year to -10 percent. While there’s little chance of reaching 2023’s $9.1 billion, the drop no longer looks as dire.",

    "title": "Kitten adoption turns into 'purrfect' proposal at Oregon Humane Society",
    "text": "Couple Riley Statham and Katie Dean were looking to adopt a kitten and get engaged — and they did both at the Oregon Humane Society, in that order.\nFor his proposal, Statham enlisted the help of the animal shelter’s staff, who placed a custom heart-shaped tag on the kitten they had chosen to take home.\nThe tag was engraved with a question: “Marry Me?”\n“I’ve been meaning to propose to Katie for so long,” Statham said. “I’ve always known that when I was going to propose, it was going to include a cat or a kitten in some way, and luckily, Katie has been wanting a new cat for so long that she wasn’t going to suspect anything.”\nOn Dec. 21, the couple drove from their home in Brush Prairie, Washington, to the Oregon Humane Society’s Portland campus. They’d been talking about adopting a kitten as a companion for their older cat, Willow, who also came from the Oregon Humane Society.\nAbout a week ago, Statham contacted shelter staff to say he was thinking of proposing when they came to adopt. By all accounts, this would be the shelter’s first marriage proposal. Staff were thrilled.\nChloe Retallack, a community resource center specialist with Oregon Humane Society, suggested the collar with a “Marry Me?” tag.\n“It was such a great idea, and instantly everyone was so excited about it,” Retallack said. “Animals are so important to relationships and people. It makes sense to have them involved in the engagement.”\nAfter looking at adoptable pets on the shelter’s website, Statham and Dean spotted a kitten named Kynareth (after a character from Skyrim video game), and made an appointment to see her.\nThe meet and greet went well, and after they decided to officially adopt Kynareth, shelter staff took the kitten in the back and brought her back out with the tag. Statham pulled out a diamond ring.\nDean said yes to both the kitten and the man.\n“I had no idea,” Dean said. “It was just shock.”\nAfter the proposal, they walked out to the lobby where their parents and siblings had gathered to congratulate them.\nDean and Statham were high school sweethearts at Vancouver’s Mountain View High School. They had picked out an engagement ring together, though the timing of the proposal was a surprise.\n“We’ve been talking and dreaming about getting married for like 16 years,” Dean said. “After prioritizing other things in our life like trying to save up for a home, things like that, the wedding took a backseat.”\nSince their story was shared by the Oregon Humane Society and picked up by local news stations, readers have suggested they name the kitten Mary. Dean and Statham are waiting to see what the kitten’s personality tells them. They’re opening to changing her name but are calling her “Kynnie” for now.\n“I hope that a couple of kittens or dogs or puppies will be adopted from this,” Dean said. “And maybe a couple of people will get engaged, I don’t know.”\nJust remember, cats — like spouses — are ideally a lifetime commitment.\n©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.
