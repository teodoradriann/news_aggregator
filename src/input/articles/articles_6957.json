    "title": "Study: Popular Weight-Loss Drug Ozempic Shrinks Heart Muscles in Recipients",
    "text": "by Sean Adl-Tabatabai, The Peoples Voice :\nPopular weight-loss drug Ozempic is shrinking the human heart and other muscles, according to a disturbing new University of Alberta study .\nAccording to researchers, people should be cautious about taking trendy new weight-loss drugs due to the potentially deadly side effects.\nUalberta.ca reports: “If people have been prescribed these drugs, then the benefits should likely far exceed the risks,” says Jason Dyck, lead author on the study, pediatrics professor in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry and a member of the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute.\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n“However, the growing number of people who may be taking these drugs who do not meet the eligibility criteria and who are not at risk have a different risk-reward calculation that they should be made aware of.”\nDyck and his team set out to study why a reported side-effect of the leading weight-loss drug Ozempic is the loss of skeletal muscle.\nOzempic, known medically as semaglutide, was originally designed to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar. However, this drug — and a host of others in this class of medication — are also being touted for their effectiveness as an anti-obesity medication.\nUsing mice for the study, the researchers found that heart muscle also decreased in both obese and lean mice. The systemic effect observed in mice was then confirmed in cultured human heart cells.\nDyck, who is the Canada Research Chair in Molecular Medicine and heads up the Cardiovascular Research Centre , says his team did not observe any detrimental functional effects in hearts of mice with smaller hearts and thus would not expect any overt health effects in humans. But he adds that there may be more impact over the long term, or some forms of cardiac stress may have a detrimental effect that wasn’t observed at rest.\n“Given the growing number of people taking this drug who have no cardiovascular disease or who are not classified as obese, we suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies.”\nDyck’s study comes on the heels of a commentary published in the November issue of The Lancet by an international team of researchers from the U of A, McMaster and Louisiana State University who examined emerging research showing that up to 40 per cent of the weight lost by people using weight-loss drugs is actually muscle.\nCarla Prado, a nutrition researcher in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences and lead author on the commentary, explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues — including decreased immunity, increased risk of infections and poor wound healing.\n“Muscle does much more than just help us move or lift things. It is a powerful organ that keeps us healthy in a number of ways,” she says.\nFor example, muscle stores important building blocks — amino acids — that the body uses when we’re sick, stressed or injured to repair itself and stay strong. It also plays a huge role in managing blood sugar, which helps prevent diabetes.\nAs well, Prado notes muscle releases special molecules called myokines that signal other parts of the body to help fight infections and support our immune system.\n“That’s why preserving muscle is so important, especially during weight-loss treatments — it’s not just about staying strong, but about keeping our whole body resilient and healthy.”\nIn the commentary, the authors suggest that muscle loss due to weight reduction may also exacerbate conditions like sarcopenic obesity — characterized by a combination of high body fat and low skeletal muscle mass — which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rates.\nThough the short-term effects of muscle loss on physical strength and function remain unclear, the commentary calls for future research to explore how reductions in muscle mass might improve muscle mass and composition.\nRead More @ ThePeoplesVoice.tv",

    "text": "Crisis in the Middle East: Biden's Diplomatic Struggles and the Looming Legacy The U.S. is facing significant challenges in halting conflicts in Gaza and preventing a broader Middle East war despite intense diplomatic efforts led by President Joe Biden. Analysts question Biden’s strategy, which attempts to balance support for Israel with minimizing civilian casualties. The situation threatens to tarnish Biden's foreign policy legacy. U.S. efforts to secure a Gaza ceasefire remain stalled after nearly a year of fighting. Iran-backed Houthi rebels continue to attack Red Sea shipping. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict now threatens to flare into an all-out regional war despite intense U.S.-led diplomacy. With the clock ticking on his administration, U.S. President Joe Biden faces a series of Middle East crises that analysts and diplomats say are likely to defy resolution before he leaves office in January. Biden has struggled over the past year to embrace both Israel's right to self-defense against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah while trying to contain civilian casualties and prevent a broader Middle East conflict. Repeatedly, Biden has faced the shortcomings of that strategy, most recently with Israel's rejection of a U.S.-backed proposal for a 21-day truce. Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer, highlighted the limits of U.S. power in the Middle East. Biden's reluctance to leverage U.S. influence over Israel has been apparent.

    "text": "By Kristin Toussaint 2 minute Read After a period of extreme drought, 2023 brought heavy rains to California. In a three-week period alone in January , nine atmospheric rivers—corridors of moisture concentrated in the atmosphere—pummeled the state with rain, leading to landslides , flooding, and levee breaches.\nCalifornia wasn’t alone: Florida saw historic flash floods in April . In May , the Mississippi River reached historic heights, causing flooding. In July, Vermont was hit with catastrophic flooding after days of rain. September marked the wettest month in New York City in more than a century. And intense rain affected other areas across the world: Unrelenting rain led to hundreds of landslides in China in September , and torrential downpours sent deadly floods through Italy in October . These storms were all examples of how climate change can intensify the water cycle , with warmer temperatures increasing the amount of moisture in the air.\nA landslide brought on by heavy rains caused four ocean-view apartment buildings in San Clemente, California, to be evacuated and shuttered due to unstable conditions. Weeks of rain loosened the soil in Orange County, which tumbled down near railroad tracks that run next to the beach below. [Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images] A collection of images from Getty photographers show the extent of these disasters—and provide an important record of these extremes. “Covering natural disasters as a photographer requires you to be in the middle of dangerous situations that the public is usually fleeing from,” Getty Images staff photographer Justin Sullivan said over email. “Our visuals from these disasters provide communities with up-to-the minute conditions on the ground and serve as a record of history.”\nAngel Vega sits in his car waiting for a tow truck after it stalled in flood waters in Hollywood, Florida. The region recorded rainfall totals of more than a foot. [Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images] For years, these photographers have covered climate extremes, from droughts and tornados to wildfires . Covering rain and floods can be especially challenging, as it’s both hard on photographers’ electrical equipment and, Sullivan added, “dangerous to navigate fast moving flood waters that are often filled with chemicals and other debris. You can easily be knocked off your feet if you’re not careful.” When covering flooding, Sullivan often uses a drone as a way to safely show the scale of the disaster.\nadvertisement\nA vehicle drives through floodwaters in the reemerging Tulare Lake in California’s Central Valley. Tulare Lake, once the largest fresh-water body west of the Mississippi River, disappeared when waters were diverted by agricultural interests to irrigate crops in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Atmospheric rivers caused significant flooding in the lake-bed area with more than 100 square miles of farms and other land flooded. [Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images] It can be heartbreaking to look at images of roads overrun with water, people wading through floods, and land broken away by heavy rain. Sullivan hopes that people see these photographs and can prepare themselves for the possibility of it happening to them. After all, climate change is making these disasters more and more common. And these photographs are evidence of that. “Documenting these disasters gives us context and something to measure against as our world continues to change,” said Sullivan.",

Suscríbete a nuestros canales gratuitos hoy:\n“En este taller buscamos enseñarle a cada niña su valor, la grandeza de su cuerpo, las partes públicas y privadas, el amor propio y el amor de Dios y su dignidad de hijas amadas de Dios”, explican en un mensaje enviado a ACI Prensa.\nEl taller será dictado por Mariandrea Cortés de Tovar, quien con su hija María Claudia Duran de Cortes fundaron en Colombia “Un amor diferente”, una iniciativa que promueve la Teología del Cuerpo.\nLa Teología del Cuerpo abarca el conjunto de enseñanzas sobre el amor y la sexualidad que San Juan Pablo II brindó a los fieles entre 1979 y 1984 en sus audiencias generales.\nEn su sitio web, se explica que “Un amor diferente” nació al ver “la necesidad e importancia de trabajar en temas claves para el ser humano, como principal estandarte de la sociedad”. Por ello, madre e hija “se han dedicado desde el año 2016 a realizar talleres para familias, niños, niñas, jóvenes, novios, matrimonios, y también congresos con invitados internacionales”.\nEl costo del taller es de 250.000 pesos colombianos (alrededor de 56 dólares estadounidenses) por niña.

    "text": "People warned not to swim at Hobart beaches after wastewater plant knocked out by Cadbury factory\nIn short:\nTasWater says it's been working with the Cadbury factory for three weeks to address the issue which led to water contamination.\nPublic Health officials say swimming in the contaminated areas can result in diarrhoea, vomiting and infections.\nWhat's next?\nTasWater says it expects to see \"improved performance\" in the coming days but the environmental watchdog warns it may be \"days or weeks\" before it's safe to swim again.\nPeople have been warned against swimming at many of Hobart's beaches after industrial waste from the Cadbury factory knocked out a local sewage treatment plant.\nThe 'do not swim' advice applies to the River Derwent between Austins Ferry and Old Beach in the north, and Sandy Bay across to Howrah in the south.\nPublic health officials said risks to swimmers over the summer holiday period included diarrhoea, vomiting as well as infections of the skin, ears and eyes.\n\"Sewage in water used for recreational activities like swimming poses a risk to health from viruses and bacteria,\" Public Health director Dr Mark Veitch said.\n\"We're advising people to stay out of the water is the short answer.\"\nTasWater said \"high strength trade waste\" discharged the Claremont Cadbury chocolate factory, owned by Mondelez International, had killed the bacteria in the nearby Cameron Bay Sewage Treatment Plant.\nWithout the bacteria to break down and treat waste at the plant, it has effectively been taken offline.\nUntreated sewage waste is now flowing through into the river and impacting beaches.\n\"It's disappointing this has significantly impacted the river, particularly at a time of the year we know Hobartians gather around the water to swim and spend time with their friends and families,\" TasWater general manager Matt Balfe said.\n\"We share their frustration.\"\nMr Veitch the areas of highest contamination would be around the treatment plant at Berridale.\nBut there was no clear indication of how bad it would be at other nearby beaches.\n\"We don't have monitoring results on the rest of the Derwent that tell us what the water quality is like after this spill,\" he said.\nHe said further testing results were expected over the weekend.\n\"It's a slightly unusual situation to have ongoing spillage into a water source. Often it's just a one-off event,\" Mr Veitch said.\nIssue could take 'days or weeks' to fix\nThe Environmental Protection Authority said there would not be a quick fix over the Christmas period.\n\"They have to re-establish the bacteria — that could take days or weeks. I'm not an expert but it certainly won't be quick,\" director Wes Ford said.\nThe issue had been festering for weeks, TasWater said.\n\"We have been working with Mondelez over the last three weeks in an effort to bring them into compliance and address the deterioration in performance we have been seeing at our plant,\" Mr Balfe said.\n\"Unfortunately, due to the high strength of the waste the bacteria at the plant have been wiped out, effectively taking the plant offline.\"\nTasWater said it expected to see \"improved performance\" from Cadbury's owners in the coming days.\nCadbury 'working vigorously' on issue\nA Monzelez spokesperson said the health and safety of the community and the environment were its \"upmost (sic) priorities\".\n\"We have recently undertaken a $3 million upgrade of Mondelez International's wastewater treatment plant which prepares milk solids and other manufacturing byproducts for safe disposal,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are working vigorously and collaboratively with TasWater to fully investigate and resolve the matter.\"\nPublic Health will continue to issue updates.",

    "title": "Notre Dame cross welcomed by Christian world",
    "text": "The reinstallation of the cross at Notre Dame Cathedral has been welcomed by Christians across the world. The iconic cross at the apse of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, which remarkably survived the devastating fire of 2019, was reinstalled late last week following meticulous restoration efforts by skilled ironworkers from Normandy. Measuring 12 metres and weighing 1.5 tonnes, this cross is a symbol of resilience and faith, being the only part of the choir roof that withstood the flames. The reinstallation marks a significant milestone in the extensive restoration project that has engaged around 250 companies and hundreds of craftsmen, architects, and professionals. The collective aim is to reopen the cathedral by December this year. The fire that struck on 15 April, 2019, caused catastrophic damage, including the collapse of Notre Dame's spire and part of its roof. Five years later, significant repairs have been achieved, notably with the reinstallation of the spire's lead-covered needle. Yet, much of the cathedral remains enveloped in scaffolding. The spire alone is surrounded by 70,000 pieces of scaffolding, weighing a total of 600 tonnes, indicating the immense scale and complexity of the restoration efforts. Notre Dame Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site and a profound symbol of Christianity, once welcomed 12 million visitors annually. The fire was a severe blow, but the global community responded with overwhelming support, pledging over $1 billion for the rebuilding efforts. Investigations into the fire concluded that an electrical short circuit was the most likely cause. The dedication and craftsmanship involved in restoring Notre Dame reflect a global commitment to preserving this historic Christian landmark for future generations. As the restoration progresses, the reinstallation and raising of the cross will serve as a powerful reminder of faith, resilience and Christian renewal.",

Ahir, almenys 22 persones van morir víctimes dels bombardejos i el foc d’artilleria israeliana, mentre s’allunyen les opcions de materialitzar un alto el foc. La intensificació de les operacions de l’Exèrcit hebreu a Deir el Balah, al centre de l’enclavament, va provocar la fugida de milers de palestins d’aquesta ciutat superpoblada. A l’altre territori palestí, a la Cisjordània ocupada, tres persones més van perdre la vida per un atac aeri contra el camp de refugiats de Tulkarem. Mentre el primer ministre israelià, Benjamin Netanyahu, i el president nord-americà, Joe Biden, avaluaven per telèfon l’evolució de les converses per a la treva, el foc creuat no es va aturar a la frontera entre el Líban i Israel. Des de Washington, Biden va parlar amb Netanyahu per emfatitzar la \"urgència\" d’arribar a una treva enmig de les últimes informacions respecte a un estancament en el diàleg en curs. D’acord amb la Casa Blanca, la vicepresidenta i candidata demòcrata, Kamala Harris, també es va unir a la conversa.Notícies relacionades Mateixa posició Segons The Washington Post, el primer ministre israelià es va mostrar disposat a acceptar certs compromisos a les negociacions amb Hamàs.

    "text": "SAN ANTONIO — We could soon have new answers about how many dogs are roaming in the City of San Antonio.\nLast year, Animal Care Services launched an unrestrained dog study to try and figure out how many dogs are roaming, if they're owned or strays, and where the hotspots are.\nThe final numbers are still being processed, but the data could potentially influence future policy decisions.\nThe city embarked on this project last summer. Officials confirmed Wednesday that they had to do an unexpected recount, but the collected data is currently being analyzed by partners at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).\nACS Director Jon Gary, speaking at the opening of a new spay and neuter clinic, emphasized the importance of addressing the issue.\n\"One of our biggest challenges that we face with our free-roaming dog problem that we have here in San Antonio is the fact that there are so many,\" Gary said.\nHe says the new clinic will help with that because sterilized dogs mean fewer litters born out on the streets.\nRELATED | ACS opens new spay and neuter clinic to tackle roaming dog issue\nThe study's goal is to identify trends and hotspots, which will help the agency determine if current policies are effective or if new ones are needed.\nRELATED | Bexar County aiming to reduce dog hoarding, mistreatment with proactive check-ins\n\"As we do these dog studies, we're gonna be evaluating those neighborhoods that we're being proactive in to see, are we seeing a reduction in the number, and so far we have,\" Gary said.\nThis is not the first time the city has conducted such a study.\nRELATED | Woman recovering after pit bull attack; neighbors say it's not the first incident\nIn 2019, officials discovered more than 34,000 unrestrained dogs in San Antonio, most of which had owners.\nThe Animal Care Services (ACS) strategic plan calls for a study like this every other year, with the latest results expected in September.",
