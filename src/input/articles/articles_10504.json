    "text": "The nation’s bourse experienced a remarkable upturn on Thursday, witnessing a significant profit surge as the market capitalisation surged by N401 billion, an increase of 0.99%, closing at N40.776 trillion compared to Wednesday’s N40.375 trillion. The All-Share Index (ASI) also displayed a growth of 733.94 points or 0.99%, settling at 74,502.58 points, compared to the previous 72,404.9 points. Consequently, the Year-to-Date (YTD) return rose to 43.94%.

    "text": "This learning unit on venous thromboembolism prevention will support nurses in helping hospitalised patients minimise their risk of developing a blood clot\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is the general term for the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a vein. It includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are both serious conditions that can have long-term health consequences.\nDVT occurs when a blood clot develops in a deep vein, most commonly in a leg but it could be an arm or another part of the body, and PE occurs when a part of a blood clot breaks off and travels to the lungs. Quick treatment is vital for both conditions; PE is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention; in a worst-case scenario it can cause death.\nOne difficulty is that both DVT and PE can be asymptomatic and develop silently, although DVT often causes leg pain, swelling, warmth and erythema, while signs and symptoms of PE include chest pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis.\n“VTE is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalised patients”\nVTE is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalised patients; it can increase the length of a patient’s hospital stay and has huge cost implications for the NHS – an estimated £640m a year, counting the costs incurred in both hospitals and community settings.\nHowever, the good news is that VTEs are often preventable, and there is a well established National VTE Prevention Programme in place in England to try to stop the development of clots in people who are at risk.\nEvery NHS trust has implemented a local approach to VTE risk assessment that incorporates the elements of the national programme’s risk assessment tool, and nurses should be familiar with their local policy.\nThis Learning Unit explains how VTE can cause long-term complications such as post thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. It focuses on nurses' crucial role in minimising hospitalised patients’ VTE risk, including risk assessment.\nAfter studying this unit, you should be able to:\n- Explain what VTE is and how it occurs\n- Explain why VTE prevention is important\n- Identify which patients are at risk of VTE\n- List what information should be given to patients about VTE, and when\n- Describe what thromboprophylaxis is and how different methods work to prevent VTE\n- Describe the nurse’s role in VTE prevention\nCompletion can also help support your continued professional development and revalidation.\nEnter the zone here for this and more Learning Units on other topics.",

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Corey Ohlenkamp says Indy DPW crews have been out since Friday, and so far, everything is going according to plan. \"They're obviously looking at that wind, they're looking at that ever changing road conditions and that bitter cold we've been talking about,\" Ohlenkamp said. He said drivers should be cautious as wind gusts of up to 40 mph and [temperatures in the single digits take over central Indiana](https://www.wthr.com/weather). \"If it looks good out, that doesn't mean the roads can't be slick, especially in the overnight hours. So, take your time and be patient. Give yourself a little extra time and space while you're commuting around town,\" Ohlenkamp said. Now their focus is on the rest of the week and the possibility of more snow. Freezing cold temperatures are also a big concern as a [Wind Chill Advisory ](https://www.wthr.com/weather/alerts)has been put in effect until Monday at 12 p.m. \"We are expecting these frigid temps to go through most the start of this week. That's something we are keeping a close eye on. It changes how people need to be ready for things. Obviously, this bitter cold is very dangerous outside, so you want to be prepared for handling that,\" Ohlenkamp said. DPW crews are still working 12-hour shifts, according to Ohlenkamp. \"Keeping a close eye on the weather forecast and making sure we are ready to go whenever and wherever we are needed,\" Ohlenkamp said. On average, DPW has around 80 trucks on the road during a snow fight. This year, many of the drivers are new and this is their first big winter weather event, and their confident this won't be the last. \"This will be a chance we got some practice this weekend. I guarantee you we will have more practice before the month is out,' Ohlenkamp said. He said they're ready for it. \"When the city needs them, they're there to stand up. They're there to do what they need to do and make sure everyone gets home safe,\" Ohlenkamp said.",

    "text": "Donald Trump vuelve a la frontera. El republicano busca robar protagonismo en la gran jornada de su rival, Kamala Harris , quien esta tarde aceptará la candidatura a la presidencia del Partido Demócrata. Trump está de regreso en Arizona, un territorio decisivo para los comicios del 5 de noviembre y donde mañana celebrará un gran mitin a las afueras de Phoenix. Esta es la segunda visita que el expresidente hace al Estado en el verano, pero la primera desde que Joe Biden abandonó la contienda para que todo cambiara. Trump quiere ganar momento con uno de sus temas preferidos de la campaña: la inmigración ilegal.\nMás información Discurso de aceptación de Kamala Harris como candidata demócrata, en vivo Comenzó su visita atacando a su rival, a quien responsabiliza de haber dado un Golpe para quedarse con la nominación demócrata. “Ella era la última en las primarias. Ni siquiera llegó a Iowa. Biden logró 14 millones y ella ninguno. Este país no está listo para tener a una marxista como presidenta”, dijo el expresidente nada más arrancar su mensaje desde un punto de la línea fronteriza. Estaba flanqueado por el muro construido en su Gobierno y por grandes pedazos de acero que la actual Administración decidió no instalar para continuar con la polémica barrera. “La llamo camarada Kamala porque es una radical”, aseguró. “Quiere que nuestro país esté abierto a los criminales del mundo para que vengan a violar y saquear”, dijo.\nEl expresidente ha vuelto al condado de Cochise, el mismo que visitó el senador JD Vance hace unas semanas . Arizona ha sido uno de los epicentros de la crisis migratoria que se registró en el Gobierno de Biden. En los primeros cuatro meses de este año, la Patrulla Fronteriza documentó 250.000 arrestos en el sector de Tucson, que se extiende por 400 kilómetros a lo largo de la línea fronteriza entre Arizona y Nuevo México.\nMás información Harris y Walz tienen la mano a los republicanos moderados de Arizona Trump se hizo acompañar de algunas víctimas de delitos cometidos por inmigrantes. Entre estas estaba la madre de Rachel Morin, una mujer de 37 años que fue asesinada en 2023 mientras corría en Maryland. El presunto sospechoso del homicidio es un ciudadano salvadoreño de 23 años que entró ilegalmente a Estados Unidos, de acuerdo al FBI. “Nosotros vivimos a 1.800 millas de la frontera. Pero esta no es segura, muchos han entrado para violar y matar a los americanos”, aseguró Patty Morin. El republicano ha repetido que la llegada de los inmigrantes irregulares han hecho disparar un 43% los crímenes violentos, algo que los datos oficiales desmienten. El crimen ha bajado, en realidad. Trump dice, sin probarlo, que las ciudades demócratas reportan menos delitos de los que hay.",

    "title": "La contaminación del aire podría causar Alzheimer",
    "text": "Distintos estudios ya vincularon la contaminación del aire con el aumento del riesgo de desarrollar la enfermedad de Alzheimer, así como otras demencias. En particular, la exposición a partículas finas (PM2.5), presentes en el aire contaminado, fue vinculada a cambios negativos en la salud cerebral. Sin embargo, el impacto específico de estas toxinas en el cerebro sigue siendo desconocido.\nPara ello, investigadores de la Universidad de Emory (Estados Unidos) lideran un estudio pionero sobre la relación entre ambos factores, con el objetivo de descubrir por qué ciertos tipos de contaminación del aire, en particular estas partículas, aumentan el riesgo de dichas patologías.\nComprender los mecanismos\nEl equipo de Emory, en colaboración con investigadores de la Universidad de California en Davis, la Universidad de Columbia Británica y el Instituto de Tecnología de Georgia, busca entender los mecanismos precisos por los cuales la contaminación del aire contribuye al riesgo de demencia.\nPor primera vez, el estudio medirá los componentes de PM2.5 en la sangre y el líquido cefalorraquídeo de los participantes, tanto individuos cognitivamente sanos como aquellos con un diagnóstico de demencia. Además, se analizarán los niveles de PM2.5 en muestras de tejido cerebral.\nDesde la investigación destacan la importancia de los biomarcadores tempranos en la función cognitiva, los cuales pueden aparecer más de una década antes del inicio del Alzheimer. Al examinar la respuesta biológica a la contaminación del aire, la investigación pretende identificar factores que contribuyan al riesgo de patología y posibles estrategias de intervención.\nModelos avanzados\nA su vez, el estudio también implica el desarrollo de modelos avanzados de contaminación del aire para medir los componentes de PM2.5 y asignar estimaciones a los participantes según sus direcciones. Se llevarán a cabo análisis exhaustivos, incluyendo metabolómica, proteómica, epigenómica y genómica, para comprender mejor los efectos biológicos de la contaminación del aire.\nLos autores enfatizan el uso de métodos de vanguardia para identificar los componentes dañinos de PM2.5, esperando que esta investigación proporcione valiosos conocimientos sobre los factores ambientales que influyen en la enfermedad de Alzheimer y allane el camino para futuros avances científicos en el campo.\nFuente: SINC.",
