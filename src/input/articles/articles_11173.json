    "text": "El Gobierno de México reportó este jueves el hallazgo de los restos de dos de los 10 mineros que quedaron atrapados en la mina de carbón El Pinabete, desde agosto de 2022, en Sabinas, Coahuila.\nDetalló que los restos fueron localizados ayer, uno de ellos identificado como indicio “A”, a las 16:15 horas a una distancia aproximada de 2.20 metros del tiro vertical 4, el cual “quedó a resguardo por el Ministerio Público para iniciar su recuperación el día de hoy, derivado de que aún se encuentra cubierto de rezaga”.\nEn tanto que a las 16:29 horas se localizó el indicio biológico “B” a una distancia aproximada de 1.7 metros del mismo punto, el cual –señaló-- fue levantado por parte de la Fiscalía General del Estado de Coahuila y “entregado en cadena de custodia al Ministerio Público a las 19:00 horas, quedando en la unidad refrigerante”.\nEl gobierno federal aseguró que continúan los trabajos para lograr la localización de los ocho mineros restantes, tras el derrumbe en la mina de carbón registrado hace más de 500 días.\nIndicó que los trabajaos de excavación alcanzaron de manera segura las galerías de la mina, ubicadas a 62 metros de profundidad con respecto al terreno natural.\nSubrayó que el avance alcanzado en los últimos meses se atribuye a la eficacia de los tapones hidráulicos y las pantallas impermeables, cuya construcción inició en agosto de este año, obras que la Coordinadora Nacional de Protección Civil (CNPC), Laura Velázquez Alzúa, anunció en este diario en julio pasado.\nAdemás, implementó un sistema de bombeo adicional ha sido fundamental para reducir los niveles de agua, asegurando así el vaciado completo de las galerías de “El Pinabete”, indicó el gobierno mexicano.\nEntre las acciones puestas en marcha, a cargo de los titulares de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Manuel Bartlett Díaz, y de la CNPC, se encuentran el establecimiento y mantenimiento de un campamento que ofrece servicios básicos para proporcionar acompañamiento constante e información continua a los familiares afectados.\nSe han realizado recorridos constantes para verificar avances y presentar informes periódicos al presidente de la República en las reuniones del Gabinete de Seguridad. En septiembre de 2022, se entregó una indemnización económica a familiares afectados. Además, se establecieron mesas de consenso para colaborar con ellos en la definición de un plan conjunto para la recuperación de los mineros, fomentando la participación activa y la toma de decisiones conjunta.\nSe han invertido 11 mil 928 horas de trabajo ininterrumpido, mediante una plantilla de 303 trabajadores, y se han excavado y retirado más de dos millones 365 mil 087 metros cúbicos de suelo y roca, es decir, más de cinco millones de toneladas de material.\nA partir del pasado 11 de diciembre se estableció el Mando Unificado, encabezado por la CNPC, la CFE y la Sedena y se iniciaron los trabajos de búsqueda y recuperación en las galerías por parte de la Fiscalía General de Justicia del Estado.",

    "text": "A rare tree kangaroo has finally made its celebrity appearance!\nA little joey was born at the end of December at the Bronx Zoo , but has been in the pouch period until now. This week, we’re finally getting our first glimpse of it, and while any newborn animal would be a cause for celebration, this is an extra special event because it is only the second of its species to be born at the Bronx Zoo and to this particular female kangaroo since 2021.\nRECOMMENDED: NYC adopt-a-dog day is your sign to take a furry friend home - for free\nThe baby is a wee Matschie Tree kangaroo, which the International Union for Conservation of Nature sadly labeled as Endangered back in 1996. It is thought that less than 2,500 remain in the wild. Tree kangaroos typically live in lowland and mountainous rainforests in Papua New Guinea among other places, and thus have adapted to a high altitude lifestyle in the trees, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Because of this rainforest habitation, the tree kangaroos are threatened by habitat destruction, along with unsustainable hunting practices and other human activities.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Bronx Zoo (@bronxzoo)",

    "title": "The Complete Medical Tourism Guide: Making Informed Decisions",
    "text": "In an era where healthcare options are expanding beyond borders, medical tourism has emerged as a viable alternative for individuals seeking quality care at competitive prices. This comprehensive guide aims to equip industry professionals and discerning individuals with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions when considering medical tourism. From understanding the concept to navigating the myriad of options available, embark on a journey toward wellness with confidence and clarity.\nUnderstanding Medical Tourism: A Global Perspective\nMedical tourism encompasses the practice of traveling outside one's home country to seek medical treatment or procedures. What sets it apart is not just the pursuit of healthcare but the opportunity to access specialized treatments, advanced technologies, and renowned medical professionals in destinations around the world. From elective procedures like cosmetic surgery to life-saving treatments such as organ transplants, medical tourism offers a spectrum of options catering to diverse healthcare needs.\nThe Evolution of Medical Tourism\nWhile medical tourism has ancient roots, modern advancements in transportation, communication, and healthcare have fueled its exponential growth. What was once considered a niche practice is now a global industry, with millions of individuals traversing borders in search of optimal healthcare solutions. This evolution reflects changing attitudes toward healthcare, with patients prioritizing factors like cost-effectiveness, quality, and accessibility in their decision-making process.\nThe Benefits of Medical Tourism\nThe allure of medical tourism lies in its myriad of benefits, extending beyond healthcare to encompass holistic wellness and cultural enrichment. One of the primary advantages is cost savings, with treatments often available at a fraction of the price compared to one's home country. Additionally, medical tourists benefit from shorter wait times, access to specialized procedures not available locally, and the opportunity to combine healthcare with leisure travel, creating a transformative experience that promotes healing and rejuvenation.\nSelecting the Right Destination: Factors to Consider\nChoosing the right destination is crucial in the medical tourism journey, as it directly impacts the quality of care, overall experience, and outcomes. Several factors should be carefully evaluated when making this decision, ensuring a seamless and satisfactory healthcare experience abroad.\nHealthcare Infrastructure and Quality\nEvaluate the destination's healthcare infrastructure, including the availability of accredited hospitals, clinics, and medical facilities. Look for certifications and accreditations from recognized international bodies, which serve as indicators of quality and safety standards. Research the country's reputation for medical tourism and seek testimonials from previous patients to gauge the level of satisfaction with the healthcare services provided.\nSpecialized Expertise and Treatments\nConsider the destination's expertise in specific medical specialties and treatments relevant to your healthcare needs. Some countries excel in areas such as cosmetic surgery, dental procedures, fertility treatments, or cardiac care. Assess the qualifications and experience of healthcare professionals, ensuring they are proficient in the desired treatment modalities and techniques.\nLanguage and Communication\nEffective communication is essential for a positive healthcare experience. Choose a destination where language barriers are minimized, either through the availability of English-speaking staff or interpreter services. Clear communication with healthcare providers ensures that treatment plans are fully understood and executed according to the patient's preferences and needs.\nTravel Logistics and Accessibility\nEvaluate the ease of travel to and within the chosen destination, considering factors such as visa requirements, transportation options, and proximity to airports or major cities. Look for destinations with well-developed tourism infrastructure, including accommodations, transportation, and support services catering to medical tourists. Consider the overall travel experience, including factors like cultural compatibility, safety, and accessibility for individuals with specific mobility or healthcare needs.\nLegal and Ethical Considerations\nFamiliarize yourself with the legal and regulatory framework governing medical tourism in the chosen destination. Ensure that the country has clear guidelines and protocols for medical procedures, patient rights, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Verify the validity of medical licenses and credentials for healthcare providers, prioritizing transparency and accountability in the delivery of healthcare services.\nPreparing for the Medical Tourism Journey: Tips and Recommendations\nOnce the destination is selected, adequate preparation is essential to ensure a smooth and successful medical tourism experience. Follow these tips and recommendations to prepare effectively for your healthcare journey abroad:\nConduct Thorough Research\nGather comprehensive information about the chosen destination, including healthcare facilities, treatment options, and travel logistics. Utilize online resources, medical tourism platforms, and reputable sources to research healthcare providers, read patient reviews, and compare costs and services. Consult with healthcare professionals or medical tourism facilitators for personalized recommendations and guidance.\nPlan Ahead and Coordinate Care\nPlan your medical tourism trip well in advance, allowing ample time for travel arrangements, pre-procedure evaluations, and post-treatment recovery. Coordinate with healthcare providers to schedule appointments, obtain medical records, and discuss treatment plans and expectations. Communicate any medical history, allergies, or specific needs to ensure personalized and safe care throughout the treatment process.\nArrange Travel and Accommodation\nArrange travel arrangements, including flights, accommodations, and transportation, well ahead of your scheduled treatment dates. Consider factors like proximity to the healthcare facility, accessibility, and amenities when selecting accommodations. Explore options for medical tourism packages or concierge services that may include discounted rates, airport transfers, and assistance with local arrangements.\nEnsure Financial Preparedness\nUnderstand the costs associated with medical treatment, including procedure fees, consultations, diagnostic tests, medications, and post-operative care. Factor in additional expenses such as travel, accommodations, travel insurance, and incidentals when budgeting for your medical tourism trip. Explore payment options, including insurance coverage, financing plans, or healthcare savings accounts, to manage expenses effectively.\nFollow Pre- and Post-Treatment Guidelines\nAdhere to pre- and post-treatment guidelines provided by your healthcare provider to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize risks. Follow instructions regarding medication management, dietary restrictions, physical activity, and wound care to support healing and recovery. Keep lines of communication open with your healthcare team, reporting any concerns or complications promptly for timely intervention.\nConclusion\nMedical tourism offers a gateway to a world of healthcare options, providing individuals with access to quality care, specialized treatments, and transformative experiences beyond their home borders. By understanding the principles of medical tourism, selecting the right destination, and preparing effectively for the journey ahead, industry professionals and patients can make informed decisions that promote health, wellness, and overall well-being. Embrace the opportunities that medical tourism presents, and embark on a journey toward better health and a brighter future with confidence and optimism.\n Global\n ",
