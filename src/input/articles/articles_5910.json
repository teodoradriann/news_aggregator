    "text": "The first storm of the spring season will sweep across the Inland Empire this weekend, producing wind, rain and thunderstorms, as well as snowfall at the higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe agency said that a trough of low pressure and advancing cold front will reach the region by Saturday morning, pushing from northwest to southeast throughout the day and most of Sunday.\n“This weather system will bring cooler, wetter and windier conditions to Southern California, with periods of mountain snow down to 4,500 to 5,500 feet,” the NWS said in a statement. “Periods of moderate rain are expected … with guidance indicating rain rates of .25-.35 inches per hour. After the front passes, shower coverage will become more scattered. Showers will be moderate to locally heavy at times.”\nThe Riverside metropolitan area, along with the Temecula and San Jacinto valleys, are likely to receive anywhere from a quarter-inch to two inches of rain, depending on the location and intensity of the downpours that develop, forecasters said.\nRainfall is expected to be light in the desert areas.\nPeriodic thunderstorms are in the forecast for western Riverside County on Saturday night and all of Sunday.\n“Snowfall of less than three inches is expected below 5,000 feet, three to six inches from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, six to 12 inches from 6,000 to 7,500 feet, with locally 12 to 18 inches above 7,500 feet,” according to the Weather Service.\nThe wet weather will persist throughout both Saturday and Sunday, dissipating Sunday night, according to meteorologists.\nWindy conditions are also anticipated, with the strongest gusts Saturday night and Sunday.\n“Peak gusts of 30 to 45 mph are expected, with the strongest winds looking to be Sunday afternoon (in the valleys),” the NWS stated. “Gusty westerly winds are also expected on the desert mountain slopes into the deserts. Strongest winds will be Saturday evening into Sunday morning, with peak gusts 55 to 65 mph.”\nDaytime temperatures in the Riverside metropolitan area will peak at 60 degrees Saturday and Sunday, with lows in the mid 40s.\nIn the Coachella Valley, the mercury will peak in the low 70s Saturday, with a low around 50, and the daytime high won’t climb beyond the low 60s Sunday, with overnight lows in the upper 40s.\nIn the Temecula Valley, temps will stall in the mid 50s during the day Saturday and Sunday, with lows around 40.\nTemperatures will increase going into early next week, with generally clear conditions, according to the NWS.",

    "text": "Il venerdì 13 all'insegna del maltempo ma migliora da domenica\nSanò, 'miglioramenti meteo da lunedì con sole ovunque'\nROMA, 13 DIC - Arriva un'intensa perturbazione meteo che segnerà questo venerdì 13 dicembre. Nelle prossime ore le precipitazioni interesseranno soprattutto il Mar Tirreno, ma poi bagneranno già in mattinata il lungo settore che corre dalla Liguria alla Campania; nel corso del pomeriggio, i fenomeni scavalcheranno l'Appennino raggiungendo anche Marche, Abruzzo, Molise e nord Puglia, ma la giornata sarà nuvolosa e grigia quasi ovunque salvo al Nord e in particolare sulle Alpi. E' la previsione di Antonio Sanò, fondatore del sito www.iLMeteo.it. Il weekend sarà poi all'insegna di una medaglia a due facce: il sabato sarà ancora un po' perturbato, la domenica risulterà in prevalenza soleggiata. E' confermato, infatti, che la nuova perturbazione sarà rapida e porterà fenomeni diffusi solo fino al pomeriggio di sabato 14; in seguito si registreranno residui addensamenti sul versante tirrenico in spostamento la domenica verso il Sud, dove si fermeranno un po' più a lungo. La prossima settimana, infine, vedrà l'espansione dell'Anticiclone delle Azzorre verso l'Italia con condizioni stabili, asciutte e più soleggiate ovunque. Le temperature saliranno in modo deciso in montagna, il cielo sarà sereno ed il sole sarà presente più al lungo nel pomeriggio (tramonterà più tardi): \"Tutte buone notizie - afferma Sanò - per scacciare i fantasmi della giornata di oggi, della parascevedecatriafobia, ovvero la paura di questo venerdì 13 grigio e perturbato\". Nel dettaglio: Venerdì 13. Al Nord: nubi, piovaschi e nebbie. Al Centro: peggiora diffusamente sulle regioni peninsulari. Al Sud: piogge forti in arrivo specie sulla Campania. Sabato 14. Al Nord: molte nubi. Al Centro: piogge sparse sulle Tirreniche. Al Sud: piogge e rovesci. Domenica 15. Al Nord: soleggiato. Al Centro: piovaschi in Molise. Al Sud: instabile su Gargano e basso Tirreno. Tendenza: prossima settimana con l'Anticiclone delle Azzorre. (ANSA).",

    "text": "The Oti Regional Minister, Joshua Makubu has appealed to the youth of Yadzo community to remain calm while authorities work to resolve the disturbances around the death of two footballers. The two youngsters died on December 25 in a head-on collision with the National Security COCOBOD taskforce vehicle. Following their death, the angry youth on Thursday took over the residence of the District Chief Executive, Wilson Agbanyo, while demanding for his resignation over the incident. An emergency District Security Council (DISEC) meeting was held to deliberate on how to ensure peace, law and order in the district. The Regional Minister, after the meeting, assured the youth that the death was accidental and appealed for calm.

According to him, an investigation has been launched into the incident. “We appealed to the Paramount chief to tell the youth in the town that it was not deliberate, it was purely an accident. They should be aware that we know it was an accident and for that matter, they should calm down,” he said. According to him, the two deceased deserved justice therefore the matter would be pursued. “We will follow up to the conclusion stage of the investigation and whatever is relevant for prosecution, we will do,” he assured.

He added that after the postmortem, \"we will sit down with the family and arrange the burial.” Mr Makubu further assured that appropriate steps would be taken for compensation to be made.

    "text": "The Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU) has threatened to increase transport fares by 60% in 2024 as soon as the Emission Levy Bill takes effect in January 2024.\nThe Spokesperson of the GPRTU, Abass Imoro, made this known in an interview on JoyNews.\nThe Emissions Levy Bill passed by Parliament imposes an annual charge of 100 cedis on all owners of petrol and diesel cars, starting from January 2024.\nThe government's objective with this tax is to encourage the use of environmentally friendly energy sources for vehicle power, aligning with its commitment to climate-positive actions and carbon offset initiatives.\nAccording to Mr Imoro, the Union is already burdened with taxes, therefore, adding another tax would not be favourable.\nHe noted that the Union has written to the Speaker of Parliament for the house to consider a review of the Emission Levy Bill.\nHe said, “In the letter, we indicated that if nothing is done about it, we will increase lorry fare by not less than 60%.”\nThis adjustment, he says is to enable the drivers to cope with the economic burden that may arise from the new tax.\nEarlier, the Minority in Parliament opposed the passage of the Emissions Levy Bill, saying the tax was not well thought through.\nDescribing the levy as ‘wusie tax’, they argued that the tax imposed on all commercial vehicles, private vehicles, ambulances, commercial motorbikes and tricycles would worsen an already dire economic situation in the country.\nBut Energy Minister, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, in defense of the bill noted that the world is moving from internal combustion vehicles and this new levy will help to propel the country to the new era of electric vehicles.\nLatest Stories\n-\nTony Chung: Student activist flees Hong Kong to seek asylum in UK\n29 seconds\n-\nYaa Pono mourns after father dies on Christmas Day\n9 mins\n-\nGPRTU threatens to increase transport fares by 60% over Emissions Levy Bill\n19 mins\n-\nLivestream: PM Express discusses GRA’s tax collection in Ghana today\n2 hours\n-\nAfrican Journalists commit to supporting parents to improve their children’s health\n3 hours\n-\nNPP primaries: John Kumah goes unopposed in Ejisu\n3 hours\n-\nOf resilience, grit, tenacity, and keeping eyes on the ball: Lessons from Afua Asantewaa Aduonum\n3 hours\n-\nSing-a-thon: Afua Asantewaa exceeds Guinness World Record\n4 hours\n-\nFDA arrests suspected drug peddler in Tumu\n4 hours\n-\nExtend VIT implementation date for consultation – GODU to GRA\n4 hours\n-\nHamamat highlights diaspora opportunities, investments at Africa Diaspora Summit\n4 hours\n-\nDon’t let anyone denigrate your achievements – Dr. Bawumia to 2023 WASSCE students\n4 hours\n-\nKwame Sowu: Unheralded Heroine: Afua Asantewaa’s Record Attempt Strikes a Chord for Change\n5 hours\n-\nMbongeni Ngema: South African Musician and ‘Sarafina!’ creator, dies at 68\n5 hours\n-\nPURC recovers GH₵10.73 million for NEDCo, GWCL in 3 regions\n5 hours",

    "title": "Tribunale ecclesiastico. Zuppi: \"Serve educare di più alla sessualità\"",
    "text": "L’arcivescovo ha inaugurato l’anno giudiziario della Diocesi con il bilancio. Le riflessioni del cardinale: \"La pornografia ha un ruolo nefasto sulle relazioni\".\n\"Bisogna puntare sull’ educazione alla sessualità , perché oggi ce n’è poca, e di conseguenza lo fa la pornografia\". Queste le parole del cardinale arcivescovo di Bologna Matteo Zuppi ieri durante l’inaugurazione dell’anno giudiziario del tribunale ecclesiastico Flaminio, che si occupa di gestire gli annullamenti di matrimoni . \"C’è in giro molta sofferenza, certe relazioni malate poi portano a violenza vera e propria\", ha comentato.\nPer Zuppi l’educazione alla sessualità significa anche \"educare alla razionalità\". Rispetto a questa tematica il cardinale non ha nascosto la sua confusione: \"Sono temi su cui siamo visti come la Chiesa dei divieti, ma ormai siamo diventati degli arbitri senza fischietto\". E ha aggiunto con il sorriso: \"Prima fischiavamo sempre, oggi non fischiamo neanche più. Il magistero dei Papi degli ultimi decenni hanno voluto restituire una bellezza alla sessualità\".\nL’intervento dell’arcivescovo ha concluso la comunicazione del bilancio del anno 2024 del tribunale ecclesiastico. Evento durante il quale Francesco Catozzella, docente di diritto matrimoniale canonico alla Pontificia Università Lateranense, ha presentato il suo lavoro sulle ’dinamiche della sessualità nella prospettiva del bonum coniugum, potenziali rilievi invalidanti’. Una relazione in cui Catozzella ha messo in evidenza \"il rilievo positivo e a volte negativo che assume l’esercizio della sessualità nel matrimonio\" e in cui \"la prevenzione d’invalidità passa necessariamente attraverso l’educazione alla sessualità\".\nNel 2024, il tribunale ecclesiastico ha registrato 20 cause depositate da persone residenti nella diocesi della città. In Emilia-Romagna, il totale è di 50 per i nove diocesi presenti. \"La cifra è uguale a quella del 2023 sia per Bologna che per la regione – spiega Massimo Mingardi, vicario giudiziale –. La particolarità di quest’anno è che ogni causa decisa ha avuto l’esito favorevole e la nullità è stata riconosciuta. È eccezionale anche se in generale poche sono le cause con un esito non favorevole\". Ad esempio, nel 2023, solo tre hanno avuto l’esito negativo e due sono state archiviate.\nGli annullamenti di matrimoni rappresentano uno strumento per dare un senso al fallimento di un legame che non doveva esserci o riscoprire che cosa aveva portato la coppia a compiere quel passato e tentare una nuova ripartenza.\nL’altro motivo di soddisfazione per Mingardi, il ritmo dell’attività del tribunale. \"La durata media media dei processi è calata e rispondiamo con più velocità\".\nUn’evoluzione significativa per il vicario, perché il processo di annullamento è composto di diverse tappe. \"Innanzitutto occorre avere una consulenza con un avvocato che possa dare una prima valutazione del caso per poi orientare l’introduzione della causa – ricorda Mingardi –. Dopo alcuni passaggi iniziali, durante i quali si tenta di coinvolgere anche l’altro coniuge, si fa l’istruttoria, con interrogazioni ai coniugi e a testimoni\". Una volta l’indagine finita, la situazione è dibattuta e un collegio di tre giudici ha la decisione finale.\nArthur Duquesne\n© Riproduzione riservata",
