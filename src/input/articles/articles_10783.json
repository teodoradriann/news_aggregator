    "title": "Trials of Michigan school shooter’s parents set to test limits of who’s responsible for a mass shooting",
    "text": "The parents of Ethan Crumbley, the teenager who in 2021 opened fire at his high school in Oxford, Michigan, are going on trial for manslaughter in cases that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting.\nJames and Jennifer Crumbley have pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in their son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. They face up to 15 years in prison.\nThey are standing trial separately. Opening statements in Jennifer Crumbley’s trial began Thursday, and James Crumbley’s trial is tentatively scheduled to start March 5.\nIn bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory.\n“Jennifer Crumbley didn’t pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths,” Oakland County assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in opening statements.\nPeople are also reading…\nIn particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.\n“Despite her knowledge of his deteriorating mental crisis, despite her knowledge of his growing social isolation, despite the fact that it’s illegal for a 15-year-old to walk into a gun store and walk out with a handgun by himself, this gun was gifted,” Keast said.\n“Even with all of that,” on the day of the shooting, “Jennifer Crumbley was still given the opportunity to prevent these murders from ever happening,” Keast said. “Instead, she chose to do nothing.”\nThe parents’ defense attorneys have\nargued the charges have no legal justification, but appeals courts have upheld them.\nJennifer Crumbley’s attorney Shannon Smith, in the defense’s opening statements, said she did not know about his deteriorating mental state and could not have reasonably foreseen her son would use the gun in a mass shooting. Smith said the shooter’s mother will testify to explain her side of the story.\n“She is going to take the stand and tell you about her life with her son, about the day he became the shooter, and about the day he did something she could have never anticipated or fathomed or predicted,” Smith said. “She will tell you that when she saw the materials in this case, she learned that her son had not been her son for months. That he had been manipulating her, he had been hiding things from her, he had been sending alarming text messages to other people.”\nParents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.\n“It’s not the first time that a parent has been held liable in some capacity for the acts of a child or a shooter, however, usually those charges relate to child neglect or manifest as a failure to keep a firearm locked up,” Marris said. “This is very different because it’s actually holding them responsible for the killings.”\nEthan Crumbley,\nspeaking at his sentencing hearing in December, said, “They did not know, and I did not tell them what I planned to do, so they are not at fault for what I’ve done.” His testimony about his parents’ knowledge of his mental health struggles could be key, but it’s not clear at this point whether he will testify.\nHis attorneys have indicated he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence if called to testify, as the appeal of his sentence remains open. In court Tuesday, Jennifer Crumbley asked the judge to compel her son and his two jail psychiatrists to testify, while the shooter’s attorneys indicated they will not waive privilege or confidentiality for his medical records, the testimony of his doctors or his own testimony.\nMarris said the trials will particularly focus on what the parents did not do, and whether that makes them responsible. “That’s why this is a tricky case because a lot of it is based on omission, not action,” she said. “A lot of criminal culpability is because you did something, not because you failed to do something. That’s why this legal argument is so novel and new and actually pretty groundbreaking.”\nThe evidence and arguments may also differ for each parent. Jennifer and James Crumbley had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split.\nPre-trial hearings previewed the evidence\nOn November 30, 2021, Ethan Crumbley, 15 at the time, took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates.\nHe has pleaded guilty to one count of\nterrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage, and last year was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nIn pre-trial hearings, prosecutors introduced text messages and other evidence they said showed his parents ignored clear warning signs.\nAccording to phone evidence, Ethan had texted a friend saying he was experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices and had asked his parents to take him to a doctor. In response, his dad gave him pills and told him to “suck it up,” and his mom laughed at him,\naccording to the texts.\nOn Black Friday, four days before the shooting, James Crumbley bought the gun at an Oxford store with his son, according to prosecutors. Jennifer Crumbley\nlater posted on her social media, “mom and son day testing out his new Christmas present,” prosecutors said.\nDays later, when the school notified them that Ethan had been searching online for ammo on his phone, Jennifer Crumbley texted her son: “LOL I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” according to prosecutors.\nFinally, on the morning of the shooting, a teacher found a\ndrawing from Ethan showing a gun and a person bleeding along with the phrases, “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” “blood everywhere” and “my life is useless.” His parents were called into school for a meeting, but they did not inform the school Ethan had access to a gun and declined to take him out of classes for the day.\nShortly after, Ethan took the gun out of his backpack and opened fire.\nHis parents have been held in jail since they were arrested on manslaughter charges days after the shooting.\nWhat this could mean for parents\nThere have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting.\nFor example,\nthe father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail.\nIn a similar vein, the mother of a\n6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm.\nFrank Vandervort, clinical professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, said parents can be held responsible for their children’s actions, such as for truancy. But the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different.\n“We do impose on parents certain obligations regarding their children, to say you have a heightened degree of responsibility for what happens when your kids do things. That’s generally in the law,” he said. “The severity of the charges, I think, are what’s unique here.”\nCould these cases set a new precedent for parents?\nIn a\nwritten opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual.\n“We share defendants’ concern about the potential for this decision to be applied in the future to parents whose situation viz-a-viz their child’s intentional conduct is not as closely tied together, and/or the warning signs and evidence were not as substantial as they are here,” wrote the panel.\nThe opinion said those concerns are “significantly diminished” by the fact that Ethan Crumbley’s actions “were reasonably foreseeable, and that is the ultimate test that must be applied.”\nVandervort similarly said he believed these cases were so unusual and uncommon that the impact would be limited.\n“I don’t anticipate there’s going to be a lot of this kind of thing filed. I think this is a pretty unique case,” he said. “It’s hard to talk about shootings by teenagers as being run of the mill. Unless you’ve got really unusual factual situations, I don’t anticipate a lot of parents getting charged.”\nEven so, Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.\n“They want to deter other parents from being negligent,” he said. “They want to make sure we have diligent parents who don’t put their kids in a position where they can gain access to firearms easily.”\n___\nYes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are more frequent\nYes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are more frequent\nMass shootings have been on the rise steadily for the past 40 years\nWhile shooting incidents show a gradual upward trend, the number of those killed is rising at an alarming rate",

    "title": "Debaten en EU permitir trabajo infantil para cubrir puestos que dejaron los migrantes",
    "text": "En un intento por abordar la escasez de trabajadores en empleos mal remunerados y poco atractivos, la legislatura estatal de Florida, en Estados Unidos, liderada por republicanos, el partido de Donald Trump, debatirá este martes un proyecto de ley que busca flexibilizar las restricciones sobre el trabajo infantil.\nLa propuesta permitiría que adolescentes de tan solo 14 años trabajen en turnos nocturnos, incluso durante días escolares, eliminando las actuales prohibiciones que les impiden laborar antes de las 6:30 a.m. o después de las 11 p.m.\nEl gobernador Ron DeSantis, firme defensor de la medida, ha vinculado esta iniciativa a su política de endurecimiento migratorio, argumentando que los jóvenes estadounidenses deberían ocupar los puestos que dejaron los inmigrantes indocumentados, tras la implementación de leyes como la que exige a empleadores con más de 25 trabajadores verificar el estatus migratorio mediante el sistema E-Verify.\n“¿Por qué necesitamos importar extranjeros ilegalmente cuando los adolescentes y estudiantes universitarios podrían hacer estos trabajos?”, expresó DeSantis en una reciente mesa redonda con el zar fronterizo Tom Homan, según reportó el Tampa Bay Times.\nFlorida tiene años combatiendo contratación de inmigrantes\nLa propuesta llega en un contexto de años de esfuerzos por parte de Florida para combatir la contratación de inmigrantes sin papeles, lo que ha generado desafíos para las empresas locales. Sin embargo, economistas advierten que esta estrategia podría agravar la inflación y la escasez de mano de obra.\nA pesar de ello, DeSantis insiste en que la participación de los jóvenes en el mercado laboral es una solución viable, evocando tiempos pasados: “Así era cuando yo era niño”.\nEl proyecto de ley también incluye otras modificaciones, como la eliminación de restricciones de horario para adolescentes de 14 y 15 años educados en casa y la supresión de descansos de comida garantizados para jóvenes de 16 y 17 años. Esto se suma a cambios previos, como la ley de 2023 que ya permitió a adolescentes de 16 y 17 años educados en casa trabajar sin límite de horario.\nMientras el estado flexibiliza las protecciones laborales para menores, las violaciones a las leyes de trabajo infantil han aumentado significativamente. Según el Departamento de Trabajo de Estados Unidos, estas infracciones casi se han triplicado en Florida en los últimos años, lo que genera preocupación entre críticos que ven en estas medidas un retroceso en los derechos de los menores.",

    "text": "In September, Chloe Potes’ mother, Kristene Potes, made a surprise visit to campus to see her freshman daughter. Chloe was surprised by the drop-in; she’d only been on campus for a few weeks and wasn’t due for a family visit for a while.\nChloe, a justice studies major, and her mom were relaxing in a hotel together when Kristene broke the news: Chloe’s father, Ryan, had been officially diagnosed with stage two multiple myeloma.\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells located in bone marrow, according to the American Cancer Society. Overgrowth of plasma in bone marrow can crowd out healthy plasma, leading to low blood counts. Multiple myeloma also affects bone strength by breaking them down faster than they’re supposed to, making bones fragile and brittle.\n“I didn’t even know how to process it,” Chloe said. “It was so hard for me. I would constantly worry, ‘What if this happens?’”\nChloe returned to her dorm confused and upset. She wasn’t only three and a half hours away from her home of Virginia Beach anymore; she was now three and a half hours away from her best friend who needed all the support he could get, she said.\nRyan, 49, was diagnosed Sept. 14 after visiting the emergency room for what the family assumed was just a typical illness. He’s currently undergoing chemotherapy.\nChloe said her father’s health seemed to decline quickly once he was officially diagnosed. Ryan’s spine fractured due to the weakening of his bones, making him unable to move around freely. There’s nothing doctors can do to reverse the injury, Chloe said, but they’re planning to run tests to find a procedure that will help restore his mobility.\nA GoFundMe was created by a friend of the Potes family to raise money for hospital bills and to purchase items such as an adjustable bed for Ryan to sleep in while at home. For a month, Ryan slept on a recliner chair, since he couldn’t walk up the stairs to his bedroom. Kristene slept beside his chair, bringing a twin-sized mattress down to the living room to stay by her husband’s side.\nIn October, the family raised enough money through the GoFundMe — which is about to hit $50,000 — to purchase the adjustable bed for Ryan.\n“That was the best sleep of my life,” Ryan said after his first night out of the recliner chair. “I have not slept this good in so long.”\nChloe was surprised by the amount of people who donated to the fundraiser, some of whom she hadn’t spoken to in years.\n“It’s comforting knowing when I’m not there, he still has a lot of support and people helping him,” Chloe said.\nDue to the chemotherapy’s side effects, Ryan started to lose hair, so he decided to buzz it all off. Freshman exploratory major Hunter Kelly, Chloe’s childhood friend, did the same thing.\nKelly said he was “shocked” by Ryan’s diagnosis and wanted to offer all the support he could, as he considers the Potes’ family like his own. He’s spent a lot of time with Chloe to make sure she’s doing OK while at school, she said.\nDeciding to shave his head wasn’t easy, but it was something Kelly wanted to do show the Potes his unwavering support.\n“Shaving my head felt like a really cool thing to do for her dad,” Kelly said. “I look nothing like I did.”\nNo one told Kristene and Ryan about Kelly shaving his head, so the FaceTime they received immediately after came as a huge surprise. Chloe said her parents were in “complete shock,” which quickly turned into wide smiles and pure gratitude.\nChloe posted about Kelly shaving his head on TikTok, where it’s amassed over 1 million likes and 5 million views. The family has earned over $500 more in donations from this video alone.\nKnowing she wouldn’t be home as much to help her dad, Chloe reached out to Dean of Students Hollie Hall to try to raise awareness on campus about Ryan’s illness.\nChloe wants to organize a campus-wide 5K with her gymnastics club to raise money and is currently working out the logistics.\n“I know a lot of people around the community also like to support and participate in things like this,” Chloe said. “I’m gauging interest in it right now.”\nHall, whose job includes helping students find resources as well as aiding them in both academic and social endeavors, gave Chloe a rundown of what setting up an event such as a 5K would entail and offered assistance every step of the way.\n“The most important message that I want students to get from Chloe’s story is that you are a member of a university that cares about our students,” Hall wrote in an email to The Breeze. “Regardless of what it is that you are trying to balance while being a student here, you do not have to carry the weight alone.”\nChloe said she’s very thankful to the JMU community — both her friends and the university staff — for checking in on her during her time away from home.\n“If I ever talked to anyone about JMU, they always say the community is so nice,” Chloe said. “I didn’t really believe it at first, but after talking to my professors and the dean and my friends, so many people have been making sure I’m okay and checking in on me all the time.”",
