    "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) – Blue-green algae have hit popular beaches in Vermont and New York, causing the first closures of the summer.\nOfficials from Burlington Parks and Rec say Oakledge and Texaco beaches are closed on Thursday due to category 3 levels of cyanobacteria. That means a high amount is present, and there should be no swimming there.\nOfficials report that North Beach has category 2 levels of the algae, meaning the most vulnerable, like children and pets, should stay out.\nIn Clinton County, the blooms closed Point Au Roche State Park to swimming until levels are lowered.",

Mr. New York, no joda más, soy chapada a la antigua, basta\".\n\"Y otra cosa que tienen que saber de mí: cuando hago algo es porque yo elegí al hombre y porque yo realmente quiero, esa es la diferencia entre algo fake y algo real, por eso conmigo se disfruta\", concluyó Victoria Vannucci.",

    "text": "Canada accepts over 210K displaced Ukrainians That’s according to a report by Canadian border guards, as seen by Ukrinform. It is noted that 210,178 Ukrainians arrived in Canada under the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET), established in March 2022. The program entitles Ukrainians fleeing the war to an urgent three-year work and residence permit in Canada, as well as financial assistance and free temporary settlement. [Canada to keep standing with Ukraine - Freeland](/rubric-polytics/3815831-canada-to-keep-standing-with-ukraine-freeland.html) In total, the Canadian government received almost 1.2 million applications for this type of visa, of which it has already approved more than 936,000. No new applications are being received for this program but those who have already obtained such a visa must arrive in Canada by the end of March to use it. It should be recalled that in the summer of 2023, Canada said it would not be extending the CUAET but the government later approved a new migration program that allows certain categories of displaced Ukrainians to stay in Canada on a permanent basis.

    "text": "Alappuzha: In recent years, Northern Kerala has been experiencing rainfall comparable to areas with light cloudbursts. Experts have observed that this intense rainfall pattern, previously observed in the Konkan region of the Western Ghats, north of Mangaluru until 2019, has now extended southward to northern Kerala. \"In Wayanad's western region, approximately 50 percent of areas bordering Malappuram and Kozhikode districts are prone to landslides . The Mundakkai area near Meppadi is a particularly disaster-prone area. The area is also very close to Puthumala, where a landslide happened in 2019. Geological factors and changes in cloud structure have been identified as key contributors to these disasters. A study following the Puthumala event revealed the formation of thick cumulonimbus clouds at high altitudes in the Arabian Sea region of Kerala, similar to those observed in Mundakkai during the recent landslide,\" said Dr. S. Abhilash, Director of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR) at Kochi University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). Heavy Rainfall Changes in the monsoon pattern are visible in Kerala. The heavy rainfall has increased. Rainfall is a major factor in landslides as well as geographical features. -Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll (Meteorologist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune) It was the continuous heavy rainfall that caused the landslide in Chooralmala. The area is steep, and the soil is of the black laterite category. It holds water well. If the pressure is too much, it will be pushed out quickly. -Dr. M. G. Manoj (Scientist, Cusat Radar Research Centre) Pattern of Rainfall There has been a change in the nature of rainfall in Kerala. During the monsoon season, the total rainfall tends to fall heavily within a short period of time. -Dr. Gopakumar Cholayil (Senior Scientific Officer)",

    "text": "Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared an account of how he currently uses artificial intelligence, describing it as a powerful tool for learning and critical thinking. At the same time, he warned against becoming overly reliant on it.In a post on X, Vembu called himself a moderate to heavy user of AI, and went on to outline his thoughts on its strengths and limitations.According to Vembu, AI has proven to be a far superior learning aid than traditional web search. “My web search has gone down 80% as a direct result,” he wrote, explaining how AI helps him learn faster.He also highlighted how AI serves as a “good debating partner”, adding that he often takes the output from one AI and asks another to critique it. This, he said, helps deepen his understanding.However, his praise for the technology came with some strong warnings.He advised against using AI to create new content. “AI can help customer support agents do their work faster but it is unwise to let AI replace human agents. It is also unwise for a human to copy-paste AI text and send it to a customer, hiding the fact that it came from AI.”On the topic of programming, Vembu stressed that any AI-generated code must go through thorough checks for compliance, privacy, and security. These checks, he admitted, are “neither easy nor fun for humans to do”.He also opined that programmers who submit AI-generated code without carrying out these checks are “failing at their job”. He went so far as to say that AI could sometimes slow down the development process.Vembu then encouraged Zoho programmers to use AI as a tool for learning and exploration, rather than as a shortcut for generating unchecked content or delivering code.He concluded by saying the company is “running a lot of experiments” and that his perspective may shift over time as “facts change on the ground”.",

Moving forward, we will continue to aid these families in improving their livelihoods and reconstructing their homes through cash support.

Police say they’ve identified four, including man who was released from prison months earlier Victim was shot at twice in one day Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) By Nate Gartrell | ngartrell@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 13, 2024 at 2:28 p.m. | UPDATED: June 13, 2024 at 3:48 p.m. OAKLAND — Four people have been charged with murder in connection with the April 21 killing of a 17-year-old boy in Oakland.\nThe suspects have been identified in court records as Jamareae Perry, 25, of Oakland, Darryl Deloney Jr., 28, of Sacramento, Dawon Carter, 29, of Vallejo, and Dewayne Carter, 31, whose city of residence isn’t listed. The four have all been charged with murdering 17-year-old Dennis Rumble and with being felons in possession of firearms.\nRumble was shot and killed April 21, outside a gas station on the 9600 block of Edes Avenue in East Oakland, during a large gathering of cars and people, authorities said. Surveillance footage reportedly shows an argument break out and five people take aim and fire at Rumble shortly thereafter, some with handguns and at least one with a rifle.\nRumble — who had been shot at just hours earlier at a Burger King on Hegenberger Road — was wounded in the head. Police identified the four suspects based on surveillance footage, authorities said.\nTwo others were arrested — one on suspicion of murder, the other on suspicion of accessory — but they were both released without charges, records show. Police also believe that Dewayne Carter was one of the people who shot at Rumble at the Burger King earlier in the day, but he has not been charged in connection with that incident.\nDawon Carter was released from prison in an attempted murder case roughly five months before Rumble was killed. That case stemmed from a 2009 robbery and shooting in Contra Costa County, when Carter was just 14. He was sentenced to 24 years as an adult, but re-sentenced as a juvenile and released from jail last Nov. 15, records show.\nProsecutors and the public defender’s office in Contra Costa both agreed to Carter’s release, according to court records. In an autobiographical YouTube video posted less than a month after Rumble was killed, Carter reflects on his time in prison, enrolling in college after his release and how he has become “a better person” after incarceration.\n“It’s a blessing just to be here,” Carter says on the video.\nPerry, identified by police as the man who fired a rifle at Rumble, was charged in 2020 with committing a home invasion robbery, and later sentenced to a year he’d spent in jail and probation. In 2022, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail for allegedly possessing a gun found by an Oakland officer during a traffic stop, records show.\nAlameda County Judge Thomas Nixon, who sentenced Perry, warned him to “please don’t have any violations” in the future because “I don’t want to see you go to prison,” according to a court transcript.\n“Yes, sir,” Perry replied. Records show he avoided legal trouble until he was arrested Thursday on suspicion of killing Rumble.\nPerry’s five co-defendants in the 2020 robbery case included Sebron Russell, who is one of four men now charged with the Jan. 1 killing of Oakland police Officer Tuan Le. Police said in court records at the time that Russell was an associate of an Oakland-based gang and that Perry was a member.\nAll four suspects are being held without bail and have not yet appeared in court, according to public records.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Report an error Policies and Standards Contact Us Most Popular Most Popular Dear Abby: I lied about my pregnancy, and now I feel guilty Dear Abby: I lied about my pregnancy, and now I feel guilty Miss Manners: I live alone in a big house, and you wouldn’t believe the insults I get Miss Manners: I live alone in a big house, and you wouldn't believe the insults I get Ask Amy: Our wedding was happy.
