    "text": "Scientists are warning of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ).\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Stretching roughly 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, this fault line accumulates massive tectonic stress as the Juan de Fuca Plate slides beneath the North American Plate. Researchers from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the CSZ within the next 50 years. According to their study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such an event could suddenly sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, dramatically expanding floodplains and generating tsunami waves hundreds of feet high, posing unprecedented risks to millions of residents, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems along the West Coast.\nTsunami threat along the Cascadia Subduction Zone The Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate. When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly.\nPoll What do you think should be prioritized to mitigate tsunami risks? Early-warning systems & evacuation planning Resilient infrastructure & community drills The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now The potential mega-tsunami threat According to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict. Researchers emphasize that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential loss of life. Areas at highest risk of tsunami The Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami.\nWhile Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100. The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios.\nEmergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems. Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquake Lead researcher Tina Dura emphasizes that a mega-tsunami triggered by a CSZ earthquake would be sudden and catastrophic, not a gradual environmental change. The study warns that without proactive disaster planning, evacuation protocols, and resilient construction, a major quake could result in more than 30,000 deaths, damage over 170,000 structures, and incur economic losses exceeding $81 billion.\nResearchers highlight that combining earthquake and tsunami hazards with projected climate-driven sea level rise makes this a “compound disaster” scenario that demands immediate attention. According to Dura, local governments, policymakers, and coastal residents must act swiftly to implement early-warning systems, strengthen building codes, and conduct community-wide preparedness drills. The Virginia Tech study serves as a critical wake-up call, emphasizing that preparation today could dramatically reduce the human and economic costs of a future mega-tsunami.\nAbout the Author TOI World Desk At TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

    "text": "As catástrofes climáticas estão por toda a parte. Chegaram mais cedo do que a humanidade esperava e com fúria inaudita. Enchentes devastadoras e secas desertificantes vêm ocorrendo em todos os cantos do planeta. Pessoas morrem de calor na Índia e no Canadá. Furacões intensos destroçam territórios ­norte-americanos. A Alemanha e o Rio Grande do Sul enfrentam inundações assustadoras. Nenhum continente está isento de destruições.\nOs pontos de não retorno em vários biomas avançam e as tendências entrópicas do meio ambiente como um todo se agravam diariamente. O mundo parece mover-se como um trem sem freios, em alta velocidade e rumo ao abismo. O grande risco para a humanidade e todas as espécies são as transformações em curso, a indicar tendências paradoxais, para o bem e para o mal. Algumas delas indicam possibilidades de soluções colaborativas. Outras acenam para soluções divergentes, trágicas e violentas. Infelizmente, as tendências destrutivas estão ganhando o jogo.\nAlgumas transformações apontam para um cenário apocalíptico. As principais, segundo numerosos especialistas, são as seguintes: agravamento da crise climática pela intensificação do novo período geológico do Antropoceno; caminhada rumo ao ponto da singularidade digital de 2045 (domínio das máquinas sobre os humanos); advento do transumanismo e de nova biopolítica com tendências desumanizadoras; um nova Guerra Fria entre potências do Ocidente e do Oriente; intensificação de conflitos armados regionais, como os da Ucrânia e Gaza; impacto dos grandes deslocamentos transnacionais (migrações de fome e escassez, de guerras e de refugiados ambientais); ameaça à sobrevivência das democracias pelo fortalecimento do extremismo de direita.\nO problema é que não existem governos com capacidade para enfrentar as catástrofes climáticas, estancar as ações de depredação do meio ambiente e imprimir direção e sentido às transformações em curso. Com isso crescem as tendências de acirramento dos conflitos sociais, políticos, econômicos e militares, tanto internos quanto internacionais.\nAs tendências conflitivas assentam-se em três razões principais: 1. Os impactos das mudanças climáticas provocam escassez de recursos e isto desencadeará a luta por recursos diversos. 2. A salvação do meio ambiente planetário e da vida implicará mudanças drásticas em relação às quais haverá resistência de grupos econômicos e de Estados. Em determinadas circunstâncias, é provável ser necessário o uso da força para a contenção da crise e para alcançar os objetivos da sustentabilidade. 3. As medidas de mitigação dos efeitos catastróficos e os investimentos necessários para mudar os padrões de produção, de consumo, de vida urbana, de energia e das políticas públicas em geral exigirão somas estratosféricas. Ocorrerão grandes disputas para determinar quem pagará os custos dessas mudanças. As forças hegemônicas dos mercados e do capitalismo globalizado agem para socializar os prejuízos e privatizar os benefícios.\nO atual cenário global não favorece o enfrentamento eficaz da crise ambiental nem é capaz de viabilizar um desenvolvimento sustentável no sentido forte do termo. Ao contrário, as catástrofes ambientais e as mudanças indicadas acima agravam a governabilidade global e interna.\nEsse quadro de crise tem estimulado saídas particularistas e nacionalistas nos diversos países, favorecendo a competição em detrimento da colaboração. Isso reforça o descompromisso dos Estados com os acordos firmados nos fóruns internacionais. Os nacionalismos extremados de direita alimentam teorias negacionistas sobre as mudanças climáticas.\nPor outro lado, a desmaterialização provocada pela economia digital aumenta a extraterritorialidade de atividades produtivas e comerciais, enfraquecendo a regulação nacional, provocando um domínio crescente do mercado financeiro e das plataformas digitais oligopolistas, aumentando o impacto das externalidades sobre as economias locais, fragilizando a regulação jurífica de justiça e de proteção ambiental e social. Essas circunstâncias deterioram a capacidade de coordenação das instituições multilaterais e das jurisdições internacionais e supranacionais.\nA captura política dos Estados nacionais por grupos particularistas e depredadores é um enorme problema, agravado pelo crescimento dos movimentos de extrema-direita, que adotam políticas negacionistas e de desmonte das proteções sociais e ambientais. É necessário aumentar a consciência dos riscos sistêmicos e engajar a sociedade nesse debate. Somente com consciência social, organização e mobilização seremos capazes de deter esse trem sem freios que se move rumo ao abismo. •\nPublicado na edição n° 1314 de CartaCapital , em 12 de junho de 2024.\nEste texto aparece na edição impressa de CartaCapital sob o título ‘Desgoverno global’",

    "text": "This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you.\nSubscribe to enjoy similar stories. India's quick commerce revolution that swept up groceries to gadgets and posed a stiff challenge to retail chains and kirana shops in barely three years is now lapping at a new frontier: Medicine delivery. Tata 1mg, PharmEasy, and Apollo 24/7 are piloting ultra-fast medicine delivery services, according to key executives at these firms. Leveraging partnerships and advanced logistics, these companies aim to offer prescriptions as quickly as groceries or gadgets—potentially reshaping healthcare accessibility. Tata Digital-owned 1mg is teaming up with BigBasket to test quick medicine delivery in select cities by December. “We will pilot in a couple of cities by end December-early January and roll out to all cities by end January,\" Hari Menon, co-founder and CEO of BigBasket, told Mint in an emailed response. Tata 1mg currently offers prescription and over-the-counter medicines, along with doctor consults and lab tests. A senior executive from Tata 1mg said that the platform currently delivers medicines in 30-60 minutes from its retail stores in Gurugram. Additionally, quick lab tests for fever panels are available in select cities. “For fever panels, consumers need to know the soonest to determine the course of treatment, so quicker service does help them. Consequently, we are seeing a significant uptake of such services,\" the executive said. Apollo 24/7, too, has introduced a faster delivery pilot in major markets includin Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru. “We have launched a new proposition of 19 minutes delivery of medicines across select pin codes spread across five cities,\" Madhivanan Balakrishnan, CEO of Apollo HealthCo, which runs the Apollo 24/7 app, told Mint in a written response. The platform has seen a significant rise in demand in the locations where the pilot was launched in June this year, Balakrishnan said. Swiggy is piloting a partnership with PharmEasy to deliver medicines in under 10 minutes in Bengaluru, using Instamart’s dark stores. However, it is unclear whether Tata 1mg’s partnership with BigBasket will use 1mg’s existing infrastructure or rely on BigBasket’s dark stores. A top executive indicated they plan to leverage the combined strengths of both the companies—1mg’s expertise in pharmaceutical delivery and BigBasket’s quick commerce. Hurdles on the way\nBut for ultra-fast medicine delivery to take off fully, critical issues around inventory management, medicine storage, and regulatory compliance need careful attention. Companies will need to address challenges like ensuring that medicines are stored under the right conditions and that rapid delivery times don’t compromise safety standards as they scale. These operational hurdles are particularly crucial as regulators and consumers alike will expect that safety isn’t sacrificed for speed. “Addressing these challenges requires advanced technology and strong operational strategies,\" Balakrishnan said. Apollo 24/7, for example, is focused on real-time stock visibility and efficient route coordination to support fast delivery times. The All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD) has raised concerns about the quick delivery model, especially around prescription verification, warning of potential risks if safety measures are bypassed. In a letter to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), AIOCD cited the recent Swiggy-PharmEasy partnership as an example of these risks. A regulatory framework for e-pharmacies is still in the works, though a June ruling from the Madras High Court in favour of online platforms could pave the way for more formalized guidelines. The demand for speed\nQuick delivery platforms have outpaced the broader market in growth, which could bode well for time-sensitive items like pharmaceuticals. “If you take that as a predictor, for pharma, which can be time sensitive—particularly over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and pediatric applications—there will be a very good demand,\" Sujay Shetty, PwC Global Health Industries advisory leader and India Health Industries leader, PwC India, told Mint. Shetty noted that partnerships between quick delivery platforms and e-pharmacies could help tackle regulatory and logistical hurdles. While e-pharmacies have existing logistics and regulatory permissions in place, faster delivery times require sophisticated demand forecasting and planning—already being refined within quick commerce. This drive for faster service is translating into financial growth. Tata 1mg’s operating revenue rose 21% to ₹ 1,968 crore in FY24, driven by online medicine sales, while net loss narrowed to ₹ 313 crore in FY24. Apollo HealthCo’s revenue grew 17% year-on-year in Q2FY25, partly driven by Apollo 24/7. The platform’s gross merchandise value (GMV) rose 2% on-year to ₹ 757 crore. The firm said it had been able to bring down Ebitda loss from ₹ 169 crore to ₹ 100 crore in the online business in the September quarter. The online pharma industry in India is still nascent, with e-pharmacies accounting for only 2-3% of the country’s total pharmacy sales in 2023, according to a report by India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF). However, the e-pharmacy market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 44%, reaching $4.5 billion by 2025. This potential has spurred investor interest: in April, private equity firm Advent International invested ₹ 2,475 crore in Apollo HealthCo, which includes Apollo 24/7 and its pharma distribution arm. Traditional pharmacies\nMuch like the local kiranas, or neighbourhood stores, traditional pharmacies may also feel the impact of quick commerce as they compete with the speed and convenience of online delivery. According to a recent report, over 200,000 small retailers have shuttered amid the rise of e-commerce, according to the All-India Consumer Products Distributors Federation. While e-pharmacies currently account for just a fraction of pharmacy sales, that share is expected to grow rapidly as the sector draws increasing investment. More here | Despair in kiranas as quick commerce roars ahead But not everyone is ready to embrace these changes. Many consumers still prefer their neighbourhood pharmacies for the speed and personal connection they offer. Bengaluru-based Sameera Kamulkar, 52, orders medication for her father in Mumbai via the Tata 1mg app but says, 'When it’s for us, I usually get it from my chemist in 15-20 minutes…I just WhatsApp him.\" She added that she might consider switching to online platforms if they began offering faster deliveries. Quick commerce platforms are rapidly scaling up to include more offerings and increase average order values (AOVs) as demand rises. According to an October report by financial services firm Nomura, the gross order value (GOV) in the quick commerce space is projected to grow by around 120% year-on-year in FY26. Zomato’s CEO Deepinder Goyal said in March that their quick commerce business, Blinkit, is expected to outsize their food delivery operations by 2025. For now, brick-and-mortar pharmacies remain resilient. “Brick-and-mortar pharmacies are still very much there...there will be some impact, but it’s too soon to say,\" Shetty noted, highlighting the uncertain impact of these changes on traditional pharmacy businesses. Scaling quick healthcare services\nIt's not just pharmacies adopting a quick delivery model; rapid healthcare services may also see a rise in the near future.

Red.Health already offers ambulances in under 15 minutes across over 20 cities, and they’re now piloting services for emergency checkups within eight minutes in Hyderabad, scheduled to launch in mid-November. “There’s a lot of interest from investors too around this,\" said Prabhdeep Singh, CEO of Red.Health.",
