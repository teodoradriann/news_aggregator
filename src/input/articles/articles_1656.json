    "title": "La impresionante piscina municipal de Castilla y León con playa en forma de guitarra",
    "text": "Uno de los planes favoritos de cada verano pasa por un parque acuático. Llegan los meses de verano y vencer al calor se convierte en el objetivo primordial de los ciudadanos. Los castellanos y leoneses de playa no pueden disfrutar, aunque sí de unas preciosas piscinas naturales que se encuentran en distintos puntos de la comunidad. También pueden hacerlo en las piscinas municipales y, como no, en un parque acuático que se ha convertido en el preferido.\nToboganes rápidos, chorros de agua, juegos infantiles, un dragón de agua, varios espacios acuáticos y hasta una piscina de olas. De esta forma, se puede resumir todo lo que hay en este complejo único ubicado en la provincia de León; en concreto, en Valencia de Don Juan. Un chapuzón en plenos meses de verano es todo lo que los castellanos y leoneses buscan.\nLa piscina de olas es un gran atractivo del complejo. Es muy curioso porque simula una especie de playa con forma de guitarra y, cuidado, que hay 678 metros cuadrados para sumergirse. La profundidad máxima es de 1,80 metros y las olas tienen distinta fuerza, dependiendo de la acción de la bola que se encuentra en el área central.\nPiscina de olas Ayuntamiento de Valencia de Don Juan\nOtro de los fuertes de este lugar son los toboganes rápidos y la piscina con toboganes de tubo. Además de la piscina olímpica para quienes quieran hacer unos largos y otra más de chapoteo, para disfrutar y pasarlo en grande.\nLos más pequeños también tienen sus zonas. Todo pensado para que pasen un día maravilloso y repleto de aventura. Este complejo acuático cuenta con un dragón de agua. Es una torre de juego con múltiples toboganes y chorros en una piscina de 580 metros cuadrados y 35 centímetros de profundidad. Así como los chorros, uno de los grandes atractivos para los niños.\nPiscinas Valencia de Don Juan\nLa piscina también tiene actividades que se van desarrollando a lo largo del verano para quien le apetezca poder realizarlas. Son totalmente gratuitas y están siempre supervisadas por un alumno.\nPero no solo hay mucho entretenimiento en el agua, sino que también fuera hay espacios preparados para practicar fútbol sala, baloncesto, tenis, pádel, mini-basket, voleibol o ping-pong.

    "text": "George Conway says Nikki Haley’s 'slavery' gaffe 'worse' due to Confederate flag removal\nGOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s Wednesday night gaffe where she neglected to name “slavery” as a cause of the Civil War is “worse” given that she removed the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol during her time as governor.\nAt a campaign event in New Hampshire, Haley was asked by a voter identified only as “Patrick”\nby CBS News, what the cause of the Civil War was.\n“Well, don’t come with an easy question,” Haley said. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn’t do. What do you think the cause of the Civil War was?”\nPatrick declined to answer as he wasn’t a candidate, and Haley continued.\nREAD MORE:\n‘Straight Up Communism’: Nikki Haley, Marjorie Taylor Greene Increasingly Share Similar Rhetoric to Attack Democrats\n“I think it always comes down to the role of government, and what the rights of the people are,” Haley said. “And I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn’t need to tell you how to live your life.”\nPatrick then asked why she hadn’t said “slavery” in her answer, and she replied “What do you want me to say about slavery?”\nOn Thursday, Haley clarified her recent comments on a local radio interview, saying “Yes, I know it was about slavery.”\n“I’m from the South, of course, you know it’s about slavery,” she continued,\naccording to USA Today.\nShe then suggested Patrick was “definitely a Democrat plant.”\n“That’s why I said ‘What does it mean to you?’ And if you notice, he didn’t answer anything,” Haley added. “We see these guys when they come in, we know what they’re doing.”\nBut the original gaffe quickly went viral, with many mocking Haley for declining to mention slavery. President Joe Biden even weighed in on X, formerly Twitter, posting the video clip with a four-word comment.\n“It was about slavery,” the president\nwrote.\nBut Lincoln Project cofounder George Conway had perhaps the harshest comment, given that he’s a fellow Republican. His comment came in response to a tweet from Commentary editor John Podhoretz.\n“Does anyone truly believe that the child of Indian immigrants to the United States, who took down the Confederate flag flying over her state capital, is a pro-slavery racist? I say this fully knowing it was a dreadful answer and that dreadful answers sometimes tank campaigns,” Podhoretz asked.\n“She’s not. That’s what makes it worse. She’s knowingly pandering to a base base,”\nConway quote-tweeted.\nPodhoretz is correct that Haley removed the Confederate flag at the South Carolina capitol building. The flag was first flown at the capitol after the Civil War in 1961,\naccording to Time. Historians said the flag was initially flown as a symbol of defiance to the civil rights movement, the magazine reported.\nThen-Governor Haley ordered the flag to be taken down in 2015, following the Charleston mass shooting where nine Black people were killed by a white supremacist at the Mother Emanuel AME Church.\nIn 2010, five years before the removal of the flag, she defended Confederate History Month and the flag in an interview with The Palmetto Patriots,\naccording to CNN. The group describes themselves as fighting “attacks against Southern Culture.” At the time, she denied that the flag was racist, and said that the flag should be flown at the capitol as a “compromise of all people, that everybody should accept a part of South Carolina.”\nShe changed her opinion after attending the funerals of those killed in the shooting,\ntelling CNN that though “there is a place for that flag,” that place was a history museum, “not in a place that represents all people in South Carolina.”\n“It should have never been there,” she said.",

    "text": "On a bright and promising Friday, March 8, the Girls Academic Leadership Academy (GALA)-Dr. Michelle King School for STEM will open its doors to host the 7th annual Young Women's Career Conference (YWCC), a pivotal event dedicated to connecting GALA students with trailblazing women across diverse fields. Renowned multidisciplinary artist and entrepreneur Justina Blakeney will illuminate the event as the keynote speaker, sharing her journey and insights into creative and STEM disciplines.\nInspiring a New Generation\nThe YWCC was conceived to offer GALA students, ranging from 6th to 12th grade, a rare opportunity to engage directly with women leaders thriving in professions often underrepresented by females, including aerospace, gaming, engineering, and more. Throughout the day, attendees will immerse themselves in speaker panels and workshops tailored to foster skills in financial literacy, social media branding, and self-empowerment, among others. Elizabeth Cohen, YWCC chair, emphasizes the event's role in nurturing self-discovery and setting ambitious goals among students.\nAddressing the Gender Gap\nDespite women constituting 28% of the STEM workforce, disparities remain, particularly in fields such as computer science and engineering. GALA, as California's sole all-girl, STEM-focused public school, is at the forefront of challenging these statistics by preparing its students for college and beyond. GALA teacher Rose Agamegwa and founder Dr. Elizabeth Hicks highlight the importance of exposing students to successful women in STEM, noting the positive impact on their aspirations and confidence.\nBuilding a Supportive Network\nThe YWCC not only serves as an educational platform but also as a crucial networking opportunity for GALA students. By meeting and learning from accomplished women leaders, students expand their mentoring support network, gaining invaluable insights and inspiration. This year's conference promises to be an enriching experience, furthering GALA's mission to empower young women to achieve their full potential and close the gender gap in STEM fields.\nFor more information about the event and how to participate, interested parties can visit fogala.org/ywcc. As the GALA community and its supporters converge for this annual event, the message is clear: the future of STEM is inclusive, and it begins with empowering the next generation of women leaders.",

    "text": "U.S. Senators Demand Crackdown on Dubious Cooking Oil Imports A group of U.S. farm state senators is calling for stricter regulation on surging imports of used cooking oil from China amid concerns over potential fraud. These imports are crucial for U.S. biofuels production, which benefits from lucrative federal and state climate subsidies. The senators seek transparency and verification measures. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 28-06-2024 04:26 IST | Created: 28-06-2024 04:26 IST A group of U.S. farm state senators is pushing for a regulatory crackdown on surging imports of used cooking oil from China and elsewhere amid concerns some of the shipments could be fraudulent. U.S. biofuels manufacturers have been buying increasing volumes of used cooking oil in recent years to make products like biodiesel that can fetch lucrative federal and state climate subsidies. But some of the cargoes may include virgin palm oil, a product linked to climate and environmental damage from deforestation, the senators wrote in a letter to several U.S. regulators and agencies and released Thursday. According to the letter, the U.S. has gone from importing less than 200 million pounds of used cooking oil per year to importing over 3 billion pounds in 2023, with more than half coming from China. \"We understand there are good actors utilizing UCO as part of a diverse array of feedstocks in their renewable fuel production, and domestic sources of UCO are held to rigorous verification and traceability requirements,\" the senators wrote in the letter, dated June 20. \"However, we are concerned with the lack of transparency surrounding the United States' efforts in the area of verifying imported UCO,\" they said. The letter was addressed to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Trade Representative, and asked for details on U.S. enforcement and verification actions related to used cooking oil imports. It was signed by six farm state U.S. senators, including Republicans Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, Roger Marshall, Deb Fischer, and Pete Ricketts, along with Democrat Sherrod Brown. Biofuels producers can collect a number of federal and state subsidies for making low-carbon fuels, including by earning tradable credits called RINs under the U.S. Renewable Fuels Standard overseen by the EPA. Europe's used cooking oil imports declined steeply after greater scrutiny on imports to prevent mislabeling, the letter said.

    "text": "The risk assessment report for the John L. Neill youth baseball complex is in. Analysis of the soils beneath the three fields found several toxins, including arsenic, antimony, zinc and polychlorinated bicarbonates (PCBs). But the biggest concern, the company said, is the lead that was detected.\nThe report was released to the Enterprise yesterday at 4:08 PM.\nIn one of the fiends—Field 1, which is the northernmost field at the site—lead concentrations three times those deemed acceptable by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) were found within the first six inches of topsoil. DEP’s limit for lead is 200 parts per million; some soil samples taken from Field 1 found 600 ppm.\nThe fields, located off Gifford Street in Trotting Park, were built on top of an old town dump.\nIn September, the town was first alerted to potentially dangerous materials in the soil. In early January, the town closed the baseball complex after learning that the health threat was real.\n“This concentration of lead detected in topsoil on Field 1 could pose an unacceptable risk to young children if repeated contact with soil beneath the existing turf was allowed,” the report’s summary reads.\nThe testing company, Arcadis, recommended that Field 1 remain closed for use and that the town install a “geotextile membrane,” or fabric covering, over the field and cover that with two to three feet of soil before it can be safe for baseball again.\nContaminants, including lead, were also found in the topsoil of the other two fields, but to a lesser extent, the report states.\nSamples from Field 2 topped out at 190 ppm of lead, and Field 3 peaked at 45 ppm. That means two of the three baseball fields ”do not pose a risk to health for children contacting lead in topsoil on these fields,” the report states.\nBut deeper soil samples found much higher concentrations of contaminants beneath all three fields.\nBetween six inches and five feet deep in the soil, Field 2 exceeds state lead limits by 185 percent, and Field 3 by 25 percent.\nArcadis stated that while these deeper contaminants do not pose an immediate threat, they could be troublesome over the long-term.\nThe company said the town could allow play to resume on Fields 1 and 2 for the next year, as long as the topsoil is tested before play starts in the spring and periodically throughout the playing season. Next year, though, the town may have to look into adding more topsoil.\nBesides lead, other landfill waste materials—like glass—were also found on the walking paths, particularly between Fields 1 and 2. Those materials ”could pose a safety risk under current conditions and should be addressed to mitigate risks from physical hazards.”\nArcadis recommended the town temporarily cover the paths with another “geotextile material” and add a soil covering.\nThe report also states that there is no imminent hazard to the surrounding environment.\nThe full report is 80 pages long, though Arcadis wrote that the information is not necessarily final.\n“Additional investigation into the nature and extent of the landfill material underlying this area is ongoing and being managed in accordance with the [Massachusetts Contingency Plan],” the report states.\n“These investigation activities include a geophysical study and additional soil borings to determine the extent of the landfill, and groundwater assessment to determine groundwater flow direction and groundwater quality.”\nTown Manager Michael Renshaw was not immediately available for comment.\nThe select board is scheduled to discuss the report at its meeting Monday, February 24.",

    "text": "Qualcomm, the San Diego-based company designing chips that power smartphones, laptops, virtual reality headsets and next-generation cars, acquired a Vietnamese startup for its generative artificial intelligence technology.\nThe local firm announced the acquisition Tuesday as part of its effort to expand its research and development of generative AI. This segment of artificial intelligence technology — which includes tools such as ChatGPT — uses large data sets of information to learn and recognize patterns, which allows it to generate content such as text, images and videos.\nQualcomm did not share the purchase price, terms or closing date of the acquisition deal.\nMovianAI is the former generative AI division of VinAI Application and Research JSC, and part of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest multi-industry conglomerates. VinAI is an AI research company that focuses on automotive technology.\nQualcomm said in the announcement that it will leverage VinAI’s generative artificial intelligence research and development for its next-generation technology for smartphones, laptops and cars.\n“This acquisition underscores our commitment to dedicating the necessary resources to R&D that makes us the driving force behind the next wave of AI innovation,” said Jilei Hou, senior vice president of engineering for Qualcomm Technologies Inc., in the announcement. “By bringing in high-caliber talent from VinAI, we are strengthening our ability to deliver cutting-edge AI solutions that will benefit a wide range of industries and consumers.”\nAdditionally, VinAI’s founder and CEO, Hung Bui, will join Qualcomm as part of the deal. Bui formerly worked for Google DeepMind, the artificial intelligence lab subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.\n“We are ready to contribute to Qualcomm’s mission of making breakthroughs in fundamental AI research and scale them across industries, including smartphones, PCs, software-defined vehicles, and more,” Bui said in the announcement.\nLast month, Qualcomm announced its acquisition of German firm Edge Impulse for an undisclosed amount. The company said Edge Impulse’s artificial intelligence platform will complement its offerings in the Internet of Things segment to support software and hardware developers.\nOriginally Published: April 2, 2025 at 4:19 PM PDT",
