    "title": "COLUMN: Congress Must Repeal the Corporate Transparency Act",
    "text": "NFIB State Director Jim Brown writes that the bill unfairly targets Main Street businesses\nIn a column that ran in today’s edition of The Tennessean, NFIB State Director Jim Brown explains that the little-known Corporate Transparency Act is a disaster for small business owners, who could face fines or even jail time for violating a law they know little if anything about.\nMillions of small business owners may soon get a rude awakening: A $10,000 fine, $591 a day for any late filings, and up to two years in prison.\nSuch are the penalties associated with a barely known mandate that went into effect on Jan. 1 called the\nCorporate Transparency Act.\nA staggering 32.6 million small businesses – hundreds of thousands of them in Tennessee – are now required to send the U.S. Treasury Department the personal information of their “beneficial owners,” which basically means anyone who controls or owns a good chunk of the business.\nBut according to a\nrecent NFIB survey, 83% of small businesses don’t know this mandate exists. They’re at risk of being punished for failing to comply with something that never should have passed in the first place, while their financial and legal advisors are scrambling to provide meaningful guidance in this regulatory tsunami.\nWhat was Congress thinking? When\nboth parties united to create this mandate, they patted themselves on the back for supposedly tackling financial crime and even terrorism, both noble efforts. But burdening millions of honest small businesses is the worst way to pursue this goal.\nThe mandate is a case study of everything that’s wrong with Washington, D.C. It was buried in a massive bill that passed in 2021, sliding under almost everyone’s radar. Yet unlike almost every other regulation, it solely targeted small businesses. Not a single medium-size or big business is affected — not one. Why target Main Street while utterly ignoring Wall Street?",

    "text": "Premier League leaders Liverpool ruthlessly exploited another slip by their title rivals to move seven points clear with a match in hand after a 3-1 win over Leicester.\nChelsea’s surprise defeat at home to Fulham earlier in the day had been an unexpected gift for Arne Slot’s side and they drove home their advantage by outclassing the struggling Foxes.\nHaving overcome the early setback of conceding to Jordan Ayew, with even the travelling fans expressing their surprise they were winning away after taking just five points on the road this season, the home team had too much quality.\nThat was personified by the excellent Cody Gakpo, whose eighth goal in his last 14 appearances produced the equaliser in first-half added time with the Netherlands international unlucky to have a second ruled out for offside by VAR.\nFurther goals from Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah, with his 19th of the season, stretched Liverpool’s unbeaten run to 22 matches.\nFor Leicester, who had slipped into the bottom three after Wolves’ win over Manchester United, it is now one win from the last 10 in the league and Ruud van Nistelrooy has plenty of work to do, although he was not helped here by the absence of leading scorer Jamie Vardy through injury.\nIt looked liked Liverpool meant business from the off with Salah’s volley from Gakpo’s far-post cross just being kept out by Jakub Stolarczyk, making his league debut after former Liverpool goalkeeper Danny Ward was omitted from the squad having struggled in the defeat to Wolves.\nBut if the hosts thought that had set the tone they were badly mistaken after being opened up with such simplicity in only the sixth minute.\nStephy Mavididi broke down the left and his low cross picked out Ayew, who turned Andy Robertson far too easily, with his shot deflecting off Virgil van Dijk to take it just out of Alisson Becker’s reach.\nWith a surprise lead to cling to Leicester knew they had to quell the storm heading their way and they began by trying to take as much time out of the game as they could, much to Anfield’s frustration.\nIt took a further 18 minutes for Liverpool to threaten with Gakpo cutting in from the left to fire over, a precursor for what was to follow just before half-time.\nThat was the prompt for the attacks to rain down on the Foxes goal, with Salah’s shot looping up off Victor Kristiansen and landing on the roof of the net and Robertson heading against a post.\nGakpo’s inclination to come in off the left was proving a problem for the visitors, doing their utmost to resist the pressure, but when Salah curled a shot onto the crossbar on the stroke of half-time it appeared they had survived.\nHowever, Gakpo once again drifted in off the flank to collect an Alexis Mac Allister pass before curling what is fast becoming his trademark effort over Stolarczyk and inside the far post.\nEarly the second half Darwin Nunez fired over Ryan Gravenberch’s cross before Jones side-footed home Mac Allister’s cross after an intricate passing move inside the penalty area involving Nunez, Salah and the Argentina international.\nLeicester’s ambition remained limited but Patson Daka should have done better from a two-on-one counter attack with Mavididi but completely missed his kick with the goal looming.\nNunez forced a save out of the goalkeeper before Gakpo blasted home what he thought was his second only for VAR to rule Nunez was offside in the build-up.\nBut Liverpool’s third was eventually delivered by the left foot of Salah, who curled the ball outside Kristiansen, inside Jannick Vestergaard and past Stolarczyk inside the far post.\nMore from Sporting Life\nSafer gambling\nWe are committed in our support of safer gambling.

    "text": "It's Official: Arch Manning Gets First Career Start For Texas Against Cupcake It always seemed likely after [Texas Longhorns](https://www.outkick.com/category/texas-longhorns) starting quarterback Quinn Ewers went down with an injury during last week's win over UTSA, but [Arch Manning](https://www.outkick.com/category/arch-manning) is officially QB1 at Texas. READ: [It's Arch Manning Time In Texas; Quinn Ewers ‘Week To Week’ With Abdominal Strain](https://www.outkick.com/sports/arch-manning-texas-quinn-ewers-week-week-abdominal-strain) Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian announced on Thursday that Manning would take over as the starting quarterback for Saturday's game against the Louisiana-Monroe Warhawks. The official Texas X account posted a photo of Manning with a simple, \"Let's ride.\" What Does Arch Manning Bring To The Table For Texas On Saturday? Manning generally played well against UTSA last week, especially considering he was put into the game unexpectedly. On his first series, he threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Moore, before taking off for a 67-yard touchdown run on the very next drive. But Manning's most impressive contributions might have been his ability to make accurate throws deep down the field on the run. Yes, he was playing against UTSA, but as Tom Fornelli pointed out, his arm strength and ball placement out of the pocket was impressive. Early in the fourth quarter, Manning took the snap, rolled out and threw the ball 40-yards down field across his body into the perfect position for a big completion to Ryan Wingo. That's the kind of athleticism, accuracy and arm strength that made [Caleb Williams](https://www.outkick.com/category/caleb-williams) the first overall draft pick. UTSA isn't the toughest opponent, and Louisiana-Monroe are 44.5 point underdogs ahead of Saturday, so Manning won't be tested much this weekend either. The more pressing question though, is what happens if Ewers remains out for an extended period of time. [RELATED: ] [Arch Manning's Heisman Stock Is Rising, And That's A Ridiculous Bet To Consider | Barrett Sallee](https://www.outkick.com/analysis/arch-manning-heisman-stock-rising-ridiculous-bet-barrett-sallee) Texas plays a middling Mississippi State team on September 28th, but a massive Red River Shootout against Oklahoma looms on October 12th. Manning against UTSA though, completed 9/12 passes for 244 yards and four touchdowns while adding 53 yards on the ground and that long touchdown run. Maybe there won't be much of a dropoff at all.",

    "text": "New Jimmy Stewart Biopic Depicts Life and Faith of Hollywood Actor: 'Show Me the Way, God'\nPhoto Courtesy: Paramount Movies via YouTube\nA new movie documenting the life of actor and WWII Air Force officer Jimmy Stewart is being developed by a Hollywood production company with the help of Stewart's family.\nThe movie titled A Truly Wonderful Life will showcase Stewart's story filled with valor, purpose, and faith.\nAaron Burns, who is a director/producer at Burns & Co., and his team have been developing the project with Stewart's daughter, Kelly Stewart-Harcourt, according to Deadline.\nAfter winning the 1940 Academy Award for Best Actor for the film The Philadelphia Story, Stewart answered his country's call by enlisting in the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1941, earning his wings as a combat pilot. He worked his way to squadron commander and helped to lead fellow Americans through combat missions over Germany.\nAccording to Movie Guide, Stewart clung to Psalms 91 while overseas. It was written in a note his father gave him before he left to serve his country.\n\"My dear Jim, soon after you read this letter, you will be on your way to the worst sort of danger. I have had this in mind for a long time and I am very concerned… But Jim, I am banking on the enclosed copy of the 91st Psalm,\" his father's note read.\n\"The thing that takes the place of fear and worry is the promise in these words. I am staking my faith in these words. I feel sure that God will lead you through this mad experience … I can say no more. I only continue to pray. God bless you and keep you. I love you more than I can tell you. Dad,\" the letter concluded.\n\"From that day, the little booklet was always with me. Before every bombing raid over Europe, I read some of it, and with each reading, the meaning deepened for me,\" Stewart recalled.\nWhen Stewart returned home after the war, Frank Capra asked him to star in the now iconic It's A Wonderful Life.\n\"It's simply about an ordinary man who discovers that living each ordinary day honorably, with faith in God and a selfless concern for others, can make for a truly wonderful life,\" Stewart once said about the role of George Bailey.\nWhat he experienced during the war helped him to play the story's main character and audiences were transfixed.\n\"At the lowest point in George Bailey's life, Frank Capra was shooting a long shot of me slumped in despair,\" Stewart once described. \"In agony I raise my eyes and, following the script, plead, 'God… God…dear Father in heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God…'\"\nHe recalled, \"As I said those words, I felt the loneliness, the hopelessness of people who had nowhere to turn, and my eyes filled with tears. I broke down sobbing. This was not planned at all, but the power of that prayer, the realization that our Father in heaven is there to help the hopeless, had reduced me to tears.\"\nStewart's standout performance would lead to an Oscar nomination for the film and he would go on to be nominated for several awards through his career.\nBut the Pennsylvania native wanted to be remembered for one thing.\n\"I want to be remembered as someone who believed in hard work and love of country, love of family and love of community,\" he expressed.\nBurns is a producer and director specializing in family films and expressed excitement about the upcoming film production on Stewart's life.\n\"I am so honored Kelly and her family are trusting us with their father's legacy,\" Burns said. \"We are excited to take moviegoers on a journey to discover the real Jimmy, and how his father's prayers and his collaboration with Frank Capra guided him through his darkest hours. Jimmy came to truly embody the characters he played, as husband, father, and citizen.\"\nStewart-Harcourt will executive produce the movie.\n\"Our family is thrilled that Aaron and his team approached us about bringing Dad's story to life on the big screen,\" said Stewart-Harcourt. \"Everyone loved him as George Bailey. Now they can learn how that movie intertwined with other parts of his life in so many important ways.\"\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\nDid you know?\nGod is everywhere—even in the news.

Juli 2015 gehört zu den schwarzen Tagen der Formel-1-Geschichte: Vor zehn Jahren starb Jules Bianchi an den Folgen seines schweren Unfalls.\nNizza – Der 17. Juli 2015 zählt zu den dunkelsten Tagen in der Geschichte der Formel 1: An diesem Tag verliert Jules Bianchi den langen Kampf um sein Leben. Der Franzose war bereits neun Monate zuvor, beim Großen Preis von Japan 2014 in Suzuka, so schwer verunglückt, dass er das Bewusstsein nie wiedererlangte. Er wurde nur 25 Jahre alt.\nJules Bianchi, geboren am 3. August 1989 in Nizza, absolvierte zwar nur 34 Rennen in der Formel 1, galt jedoch als eines der größten Talente im internationalen Motorsport. Die Leidenschaft für den Rennsport wurde ihm gewissermaßen in die Wiege gelegt: Vater Philippe betrieb eine eigene Kartstrecke, auf der Jules bereits im Alter von drei Jahren seine ersten Runden drehte.\nAuch in der Familie gab es motorsportliche Vorbilder. Großvater Mauro Bianchi war in der Sportwagen-Weltmeisterschaft erfolgreich, Großonkel Lucien Bianchi startete in der Formel 1 und feierte 1968 sogar den Gesamtsieg beim 24-Stunden-Rennen in Le Mans. Dass auch Jules Bianchi eines Tages zu den herausragenden Rennfahrern der Welt zählen würde, daran bestand kaum ein Zweifel.\nJules Bianchi sollte für Ferrari in der Formel 1 fahren\nBianchi kämpfte sich über die Nachwuchsklassen bis in die Formel 1, feierte sein Debüt in der Königsklasse im März 2013 beim Großen Preis von Australien in Melbourne. Ein Jahr später, in der Saison 2014, sorgte der Franzose ausgerechnet bei seinem Heimrennen in Monaco für Aufsehen, als er mit einem neunten Platz sowohl für sich als auch das unterlegene Marussia-Team die ersten WM-Punkte einfahren konnte.\nNicht nur dank dieses Erfolgs wurde er hinter den Kulissen bereits als möglicher Nachfolger von Kimi Räikkönen bei Ferrari gehandelt. Als Mitglied der Ferrari Driver Academy galt Bianchi als einer der vielversprechendsten Kandidaten für ein künftiges Cockpit bei der Scuderia.\n„Er war unser Mann der Zukunft, wenn einmal der Vertrag mit Kimi Räikkönen endet“, verriet der damalige Ferrari-Präsident Luca di Montezemolo gegenüber Sky Sport Italia. Doch dazu kam es nie: Am 5. Oktober 2014 nahm das Leben des talentierten Franzosen eine tragische Wendung.\nEin verregneter Tag im Oktober 2014, der alles verändert ...\nDer Große Preis von Japan auf dem Suzuka International Racing Course war von Regen geprägt, die Bedingungen für die Fahrer entsprechend schwierig. In Runde 42 kam Sauber-Pilot Adrian Sutil von der Strecke ab und blieb im Kiesbett stecken. Um den Wagen bergen zu können, wurden gelbe Flaggen geschwenkt, und ein Bergefahrzeug rückte auf die Strecke aus.\nNur einen Umlauf später, in der 43. Runde des Rennens, ereignete sich der folgenschwere Unfall: Bianchi, zu diesem Zeitpunkt im Marussia unterwegs, war offenbar zu schnell unterwegs und verlor an gleicher Stelle wie Sutil die Kontrolle über seinen Wagen. Spätere Untersuchungen ergaben, dass Bianchi nur 2,61 Sekunden später mit etwa 120 km/h in das Heck des Bergefahrzeugs prallte.\nDer Kopf des jungen Franzosen wurde dabei mit einer Verzögerung von 254 g belastet. Bianchi zog sich schwerste Schädelverletzungen zu und verlor auf der Stelle das Bewusstsein. Die Rettungskräfte waren schnell vor Ort und begannen umgehend mit lebensrettenden Maßnahmen. Drei Runden später wurde das Rennen abgebrochen und Lewis Hamilton zum Sieger erklärt.\nZum Feiern war zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits niemandem zumute, denn die Nachricht von Bianchis Zustand verbreitete sich rasch. Weil der Helikopter bei den widrigen Wetterverhältnissen nicht starten konnte, wurde der verletzte Franzose per Rettungswagen in das nächstgelegene Krankenhaus nach Yokkaichi gebracht. Dort erfolgte eine Notoperation, anschließend wurde Bianchi in ein künstliches Koma versetzt.\nBianchis Unfalltod hat die Formel 1 nachhaltig verändert\nAuch seine Familie reiste umgehend aus Frankreich an und traf bereits am folgenden Tag in Japan ein. Doch Bianchis Zustand blieb auch in den folgenden Tagen weiterhin kritisch. Zwar atmete er selbstständig, als er nach mehreren Wochen aus dem Koma geholt und in die Heimat nach Nizza verlegt wurde, aber das Bewusstsein erlangte er auch in den folgenden Monaten nicht wieder.\nAm 17. Juli 2015 erlag Jules Bianchi schließlich seinen schweren Kopfverletzungen. Es war der bislang letzte tödliche Unfall in der Formel 1, doch einer, der die Königsklasse nachhaltig veränderte. So setzte sich der Automobil-Weltverband FIA infolge des Unfalls für die rasche Einführung des Halo-Systems ein. Auch der Einsatz des Safety-Cars gehört in vergleichbaren Situationen längst zum Standard.\nDie Startnummer 17, die Bianchi zu seiner Zeit im Marussia trug, wird ihm zu Ehren seither nicht mehr vergeben. Sein einst für Ferrari vorgesehenes Cockpit übernahm schließlich Charles Leclerc, und damit kein Geringerer als Bianchis Patenkind. Auch Leclerc drehte seine ersten Runden auf der Kartbahn von Bianchis Vater und war mit dem Franzosen eng befreundet. Zumindest ein Teil des verstorbenen Franzosen ist der Formel 1 damit bis heute erhalten geblieben. (SoBre)",

    "title": "Arizona Military Museum CLOSES after Vietnam vet founder, 80, told tour: 'Eventually they will replace me with some gay, black, woman woke Jew' and claimed mannequin with hand on its hip represented gay soldiers | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "A Vietnam War veteran has been ousted from the military museum he curated for decades after suggesting he would be replaced by 'some gay, black, woman, woke Jew.' Joe Abodeely, 80, spent half his life overseeing the Arizona Military Museum which was a personal passion for the Army veteran who served in the Vietnam War - his own uniform was even on display. But for more than four months, the museum has been closed to the public, and the nonprofit overseeing it no longer has state support. Arizona National Guard Brigadier General John Conley sent Abodeely a letter in February expressing concern about statements the senior made during a tour. 'Eventually they will replace me with some gay, Black, woman, woke Jew who will ruin the place,' Abodeely said, according to the letter obtained by the Arizona Republic. Joe Abodeely, 80, oversaw the Arizona Military Museum for 40 years - but was forced to step away due to 'unprofessional language'. He is pictured next to a mannequin of a soldier with its hand on its hip that he suggested was gay The museum was shuttered after the state severed ties with the nonprofit overseeing it and ordered them to vacate the building Abodeely, a Vietnam War veteran, had personal ties to the museum, even displaying his own uniform He was alleged to have called 'all Americans' stupid and 'told the members of the tour group that they knew nothing of the realities of the Vietnam era because they were too young, brainwashed, stupid, duped, uneducated, or uncaring.' The 86-year-old museum is run by the Arizona National Guard Historical Society, a nonprofit that Abodeely led for decades, and sits on military property. Following the incident, the state's Department of Emergency and Military Affairs ordered Abodeely to attend two hours of diversity, equity and inclusion training. He obliged. Major General Kerry Muehlenbeck, the adjutant general of the guard in Arizona, also wanted to meet with him. But the offensive language didn't stop there, despite Abodeely attaining a certificate of completion for the course. In an interview, he remarked that a museum mannequin with a 'hand on its hip' represented gay soldiers. A day later, Abodeely issued an apology, attributing his erratic behavior to the combined stress of undergoing tests for cancer and the museum fiasco. 'I'm arrogant, and I know that,' the 80-year-old said. 'I am somewhat egotistical, but I care about other people. I care about other things. I care about my nation, my state and I care about the museum.' Abodeely's remarks during the tour are at odds with posts on the museum's Facebook page where he condemned racists and spoke out about division in the country. Abodeely was reprimanded for telling a tour: 'Eventually they will replace me with some gay, Black, woman, woke Jew who will ruin the place' He allegedly told the group that they were 'too young, brainwashed, stupid, duped, uneducated, or uncaring' to understand the 'realities of the Vietnam era' The 86-year-old museum was formerly run by the Arizona National Guard Historical Society, a nonprofit that Abodeely led for decades 'It is not about economics, or politics, or ideology, or the haves vs. the have nots - it is clearly about RACE,' he wrote of the motivations behind the January 6 siege of the Capitol. 'Those people are simply ignorant, despicable racists; and their actions have brought the race issue to the forefront. It took a racist President and supporters to do it.' In an interview, he claimed he was being pushed out due to a personal vendetta held by Muehlenbeck, a claim that her spokesperson denied. Mike Snozek, a U.S. Army and National Guard veteran, was on the board of the Arizona National Guard Historical Society for more than a dozen years before the turmoil. He said Abodeely misrepresented Muehlenbeck's views about the museum to the board and the public. Snozek said he was acting at the request of the majority of board members when he called a meeting last summer and they voted him in as the new leader to replace Abodeely. Abodeely, in turn, held that the vote was illegitimate and named his own new board. The guard forbade him from interacting with guests at the museum, but spokesperson Captain Erin Hannigan said he continued to use 'unprofessional language.' 'In turn, the Adjutant General lost confidence in Mr. Abodeely's ability to interact professionally, and respectfully with members of the public,' she said. The army veteran was ousted from his leading role at the Arizona National Guard Historical Society (pictured: Abodeely, third from left, and his platoon) When he refused to step down alongside the newly-appointed leader, the state announced that it would find a new group to oversee the museum and reopen it The nonprofit must provide a written plan for the removal of its property from the museum by December 18 While Snozek expressed understanding for why Abodeely wouldn't want to part with the museum, he added: 'There's a way to conduct oneself and a way not to conduct oneself, and we have rules, and we follow them. 'And there's what's socially acceptable and there's what's absolutely not socially acceptable.' In an effort to preserve the museum in its current location, Snozek volunteered to step down if Abodeely would, too. But the Vietnam vet, who served as a deputy county attorney and a criminal defense lawyer later in his life, refused. Muehlenbeck ultimately announced her decision to sever state ties with the group on November 17. Now, the nonprofit must provide her with a written plan for the removal of its property from the museum by December 18, according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson added that the Arizona National Guard plans to find a new group to run the museum and reopen it.",

    "title": "The Hidden Link Between Seed Oils and America’s Fentanyl Crisis",
    "text": "In the shadow of America’s opioid crisis lies a less obvious, yet potentially critical factor: the widespread consumption of seed oils\nThese oils, which include soy, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, peanut, corn, and canola, have become dietary staples, largely due to government subsidies and outdated nutritional guidelines.\nFor many years, I have pioneered the political and cultural dimensions of America’s seed oil problem on broadcast news radio and deep-dive podcasts with the scientists investigating these harmful oils.\nWhat I have found could help solve both the opioid epidemic as well as our overall metabolic health.\nThere’s growing evidence suggesting that our government’s decades-long dietary shift towards seed oils could be exacerbating chronic pain, which in turn fuels the demand for pain relief, often in the form of opioids and the more dangerous fentanyl.\nWhile the supply side of the fentanyl crisis can be limited by wise border policies, President Trump and his potential HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can use the health promoting policies of removing chronic pain-exacerbating seed oil subsidies and federal nutritional recommendations to drive down the demand for pain-masking opioids.\nProfessor Bruce Hammock at UC Davis has conducted research that elucidates how linoleic acid, abundant in these seed oils, is metabolized into arachidonic acid. This process is significant because, as Hammock explains, “An increase in dietary linoleic acid leads to higher levels of arachidonic acid, which can be metabolized into pro-inflammatory eicosanoids” (Hammock et al., 2021).\nThese substances are pivotal in creating an inflammatory environment that can manifest as chronic pain, pushing individuals towards pain management solutions.\nThe correlation between the surge in seed oil consumption and the rise in chronic pain conditions isn’t mere happenstance. A study in the Journal of Lipid Research confirms, “The increase in the consumption of linoleic acid from seed oils has paralleled the increase in the prevalence of chronic pain conditions” (Smith et al., 2017).\nThis suggests a causal relationship where dietary choices are setting the stage for widespread chronic pain, inadvertently increasing the market for painkillers.\nResearchers like Tucker Goodrich and Chris Knobbe, M.D., have been vocal about these findings. Goodrich highlights, “The modern diet, rich in seed oils high in linoleic acid, creates an inflammatory environment in the body,” aligning with observations that these oils contribute to systemic inflammation (Goodrich, 2020).\nDr. Knobbe’s research echoes this, pointing out that “The shift from traditional fats to industrial seed oils has been detrimental, potentially contributing to the epidemic of chronic diseases” (Knobbe, 2019).\nGovernment policies have inadvertently shaped this dietary shift. By subsidizing seed oil production, these oils have become cheap and ubiquitous, infiltrating everything from school lunches to hospital meals where reducing inflammation should arguably be a priority.\nHere’s where President Trump, RFK Jr, reformers at the USDA, and Elon Musk’s DOGE group have a pivotal role. The Trump administration’s push for deregulation and subsidy reform could focus on reevaluating these economic incentives that make high-linoleic acid oils a dangerous dietary norm.\nFurthermore, the nutritional guidelines, which influence meal planning across various institutions, require a critical overhaul. They currently promote these oils for their supposed heart-health benefits, yet as insights from the aforementioned studies suggest, this might be counterproductive.\nThe guidelines should pivot towards endorsing traditional, less inflammatory fats like butter, beef tallow, and coconut oil. Research has shown that “Saturated fats like those in coconut oil have demonstrated benefits in reducing inflammation” (Fernandez et al., 2021).\nCongress, along with the Trump administration, can level the playing field for producers of healthier fats. By adjusting subsidies, regulations, and tax policies, we could encourage a dietary shift that could lessen chronic pain, potentially decreasing the reliance on opioids.\nThis isn’t just about economic policy but about public health strategy. Make America Healthy Again received an electoral mandate because of its promise to put human health before special interests.\nIt is critical that the administration delivers on this immediately.\nThe biochemical pathway from seed oil consumption to chronic pain isn’t just theoretical. When we reduce the intake of linoleic acid, “The biochemical foundation for severe chronic pain is significantly undermined,” reducing the drive for extreme pain management methods (Ramsden et al., 2013).\nIn essence, addressing the opioid and fentanyl crisis isn’t solely responsibility of border control, law enforcement or addiction treatment. It starts with what’s on our plates.\nThe government’s role in our food choices directly impacts our health outcomes. By realigning agricultural policies with the health needs of citizens, not just the interests of corporate welfare, we could see a decline in chronic pain and, subsequently, demand for opioids.\nThis is not a conservative or liberal issue; it’s an American one. Let’s empower Americans with healthier food choices, potentially alleviating the very pain that drives many into the arms of addiction and fentanyl overdoses.\nSee more here malone.news\nPlease Donate Below To Support Our Ongoing Work To Defend The Scientific Method PRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
