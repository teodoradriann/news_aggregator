    "title": "He Ignored the Controversy to Make His Most Impactful (and Successful) Music: The Meaning Behind “The Boy in the ... - American Songwriter",
    "text": "Graceland began as jam sessions in South Africa. The Johannesburg recordings changed how Paul Simon wrote songs, with new chord variations and the Bagithi Khumalo bass lines shaping vocal melodies in ways entirely new to him.\nVideos by American Songwriter\n“\nThe Boy in the Bubble” was the starting point, and it began with a piano accordion. Forere Motloheloa, who led a group called Tau Ea Matsekha, played the piano accordion and created a song with Simon that explores themes of inequality and terrorism. It’s a song of shared experience, evident by how two musical worlds complement each other.\nMiracle and Wonder\nSimon told Rolling Stone the song “…devolved down to hope and dread. That’s the way I see the world, a balance between the two, but coming down on the side of hope.” He wrote the music in South Africa with Motloheloa but finished the words in America. Due to the track’s complexity, Simon struggled to fit words into the African rhythms.\nHis producer, Roy Halee, edited reels of tape from the sessions, amassed from hours of studio time where Simon’s perfectionism required multiple takes before he was pleased. The process was new to Motloheloa’s group, who were accustomed to working quickly. Though the process was arduous, Simon emerged from the studio with the sound he was chasing.\nIt was a slow day\nAnd the sun was beating\nOn the soldiers by the side of the road\nThere was a bright light\nA shattering of shop windows\nThe bomb in the baby carriage\nWas wired to the radio\nSacrificing Sacrifice\nTraveling to South Africa was complicated by the U.N.’s cultural boycott to end apartheid—the country’s racial segregation policy ensuring authoritarian minority white rule. The boycott called for artists, musicians, and others to refrain from exchanges with South Africa as long as its racist policy stayed in place. Knowing he’d be criticized, Simon ignored the boycott and traveled to South Africa to pursue his project. He told the New York Times he wasn’t there to perform for segregated audiences or the government but to work with people he “greatly admired.”\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nThis is the long-distance call\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo\nThe way we look to us all\nThe boycott not only stopped cultural imports but also restricted exports. Simon first heard South African street music—mbaqanga—through bootleg cassette recordings because the local music wasn’t allowed outside the country. He traveled to Johannesburg with Halee to record with South African musicians and explore the new sounds inspiring him. The new sounds lifted Simon from his depression following the commercial letdown of Hearts and Bones (1983); he felt refreshed to write again.\nIt’s a turn-around jump shot\nIt’s everybody jump start\nIt’s every generation throws a hero up the pop charts\nMedicine is magical, and magical is art\nThink of the boy in the bubble\nAnd the baby with the baboon heart\nCritics challenged Simon for appropriating African culture for his benefit, and while the album became his most successful, it remains controversial. Anticipating a backlash, Simon paid the African musicians triple the New York recording scale and offered royalties to the songwriters who contributed to his compositions. Some musicians— breaking their country’s sanctions—toured with Simon and were joined in Zimbabwe by exiled trumpeter Hugh Masekela and singer Miriam Makeba.\nGraceland‘s Impact: More Objective Good Than Subjective Bad\nGraceland introduced South African music and culture to a broad audience; it also helped raise awareness of the country’s political strife. Western artists a generation later traveled to Africa—post-apartheid—for musical inspiration, like Blur’s Damon Albarn, who worked with Fela Kuti’s drummer Tony Allen on albums for Gorillaz; the Good, the Bad & the Queen; and Rocket Juice & the Moon, featuring Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n[[RELATED: 4 Musicians Who Have Navigated Hearing Loss in Their Careers]]https://americansongwriter.com/4-musicians-who-have-navigated-hearing-loss-in-their-careers/\nMusic is borderless and evolves like the rest of culture. Culture doesn’t just spring up from nothing. It’s how Jamaicans, listening to American rhythm and blues radio, began toasting (or rapping) to dubbed instrumentals, with sounds bouncing to and from West African chanting traditions. Hip-hop exists by way of jazz poetry, which traveled from African and European traditions to America.\nHow culture is exchanged—either shared, borrowed, or stolen through imperialism—hung over Graceland then and remains decades later. Was Simon right to defy the United Nations’ cultural boycott? The debates remain. But the pure joy of Graceland lives above the conversations surrounding the album. It is now a part of culture, and as the context of the album’s creation fades, the songs remain the same.\nPhoto by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images",

    "text": "Canada is rejecting foreign workers, international students, and tourists at an all-time high. In 2024, immigration officials denied 2.35 million temporary resident applications, accounting for 50% of all submissions, a significant increase from 1.8 million rejections (35%) in the previous year, according to data obtained by the Toronto Star.Soaring rejection rates Visitor visas faced the harshest scrutiny, with 54% of applicants denied, up from 40% in 2023. Student permit rejections surged to 52%, a dramatic increase from 38% the previous year. Work permits, while slightly improved, still saw 22% of applicants turned away.ALSO READ: Canada changes Express Entry rules; removes bonus CRS points for arranged employmentThis surge in rejections highlights Canada's increasingly strict immigration policies as the federal government addresses growing public concerns about escalating living costs and a housing crisis. Ottawa has already reduced its target for new permanent residents by 20% for 2025-2027, aiming for 395,000 new arrivals in 2025, down from earlier projections.ALSO READ: India & Pakistan are safer than the United States.

Applications for visitor records, which extend a migrant’s legal stay without granting work or study rights, have nearly doubled from 196,965 in 2019 to 389,254 in 2024. While 95% of these applications were approved, the backlog is growing—with current processing times stretching to 119 days.ALSO READ: World Happiness report: US is not so happy anymore; where does India stand?The crackdown comes amid a broader global decline in student enrollments.

    "title": "“Todos sabemos su historial de corrupción”: el antes y después del PC por SQM",
    "text": "Banderas del Partido Comunista (PC).\n“Yo creo que a nadie en el gobierno le gusta tener que negociar y entenderse con SQM. Yo parto de esa base, porque además todos sabemos el historial de corrupción al cual está asociado esa empresa. Desde ese punto de vista, no es una empresa que genere confianza. Menos aún que en su propiedad esté Julio Ponce Lerou. Pero todos entendemos que esperar hasta el 2030 hace que esta política llegue tarde en relación a la necesidad de explotar e industrializar litio en el salar de Atacama. Desde ese punto de vista, es un dato de la realidad”.\nCon esas palabras abordaba en abril de este año el senador comunista, Daniel Núñez, el lanzamiento que por eso días hizo el Presidente Gabriel Boric de la nueva estrategia del litio, encargando a Codelco negociar su ingreso al Salar de Atacama.\nOcho meses después, este miércoles, se conoció que Codelco alcanzó finalmente un acuerdo con SQM para producir litio en conjunto en el salar hasta 2060.\nEn su cuenta de X (antes Twitter), el senador Núñez fue uno de los que esta vez salió a valorar las implicancias del acuerdo. “Histórico paso en la estrategia nacional del Litio. Codelco tomará control del Salar de Atacama. Es clave que esta oportunidad sea invertida para avanzar hacia un nuevo modelo de desarrollo. De esa forma generaremos un ciclo virtuoso para mayor bienestar social”, escribió.\nEn abril, antes de que el Presidente diera a conocer oficialmente la política nacional del litio, el Partido Comunista había emitido una dura declaración con cuestionamientos a SQM.\nEn esa ocasión la colectividad valoró que con el anuncio que iba a realizar el Mandatario el Estado asumiría “un rol preponderante en la exploración y explotación de este recurso”. En el documento escribieron: “El Partido Comunista de Chile celebra esta decisión. El litio es un mineral estratégico, clave para la transición energética, que en Chile por mandato constitucional está reservado al Estado. Los yacimientos de litio están en los salares. Estos son ecosistemas frágiles, que requieren ser cuidados, donde habitan comunidades y pueblos indígenas”.\nLuego apuntaron a SQM, cuestionando la posibilidad de extensión de contratos con la minera no metálica, el vínculo de ésta con Ponce Lerou -exyerno de Augusto Pinochet y quien fue controlador de la compañía por décadas- y la investigación en su contra por financiamiento ilegal de la política.\n“El país es testigo de la millonaria campaña que están realizando las empresas privadas del Salar de Atacama para extender sus contratos vigentes más allá de la fecha de vencimiento. Ello es contrario a los intereses de Chile. Peor aún, la principal arrendataria, SQM, sigue controlada por Ponce Lerou, vinculado al mayor escándalo de financiamiento ilegal de la política. Rechazamos rotundamente ese propósito”, decía el documento que difundió la colectividad.\nPor su parte, el exbanderado comunista y alcalde de Recoleta, Daniel Jadue, planteó a fines de abril -en su programa Sin Maquillaje-, que “sería la verdad bastante discutible, por no decir vergonzoso, que termináramos negociando con Ponce Lerou y alargando los contratos de arriendo o peor aún asociándonos con un sinvergüenza de esta calaña (…) SQM es una empresa que corrompió el sistema político y muy bien lo saben la Concertación y la derecha que fueron los que percibieron los financiamientos ilegales, pero se encargaron, con acuerdos entre todas las partes, de sepultar estos delitos de cuello y corbata”.\nEsta semana, una vez anunciado el pacto entre la minera estatal y SQM, éste fue celebrado por otra figura del PC, hoy pieza clave del gobierno, la vocera Camila Vallejo.\nЎHistГіrico! El acuerdo entre Codelco y SQM es una excelente noticia. Acabamos de convertir a Codelco en una de las empresas de Litio más grandes del mundo. Esto es un claro ejemplo de que cuando hay real interés en lograr acuerdos, cuando el diálogo es genuino en post de mayores beneficios, son las personas quienes ganan. #LitioPorChile es presente, futuro, y sobre todo, de todos los chilenos y chilenas. ¡Seguimos!”, posteó la ministra en X.\nDesde la izquierda, de hecho, fueron mayoritarias las voces que salieron a celebrar el pacto.\nLa diputada de Convergencia Social, Javiera Morales, aseguró que el anuncio “es una gran noticia para el país. Significará mayores recursos para los chilenos, para enfrentar los desafíos sociales que tiene actualmente y en el futuro. Si el pasado y el presente de Chile están vinculados a la nacionalización del cobre, el futuro sin dura, está vinculado a la industria del litio”.\nEl diputado de Revolución Democrática (RD), Jorge Brito, por su parte, dijo que “la estrategia nacional del litio tiene por objetivo enriquecer al país como paso fundamental para el desarrollo económico. Gracias a una alianza público-privada que ha anunciado el Presidente Boric le va a permitir al Estado tener participación mayoritaria en la exploración y extracción del litio, permitiendo operar en el Salar de Atacama hasta el año 2060″.",

    "title": "China's Baidu says advertisers still subdued as revenue falls 3%",
    "text": "China's Baidu on Thursday said it had not yet seen any notable improvement in advertising spending patterns or consumer spending despite recent government stimulus efforts, as it reported a 3% fall in third-quarter revenue. The operator of China's largest search engine relies on online advertising for more than half of its revenue, making it highly sensitive to the slowing economy and weak consumption that has pressured businesses, especially small and mid-sized enterprises, to curb advertising spend. Chinese policymakers have in recent months unveiled a number of measures to try and pull the world's second largest economy out of its deflationary funk and Baidu said it believed it would still take some time for the measures to reach offline merchants. \"So far in Q4, we have not observed a notable improvement in advertising spending patterns, and consumer spending remains subdued,\" Baidu CEO Robin Li told analysts on a post-earnings call. \"We remain conservatively optimistic about the recovery trend ahead.\" Revenue in Baidu's online marketing division fell 4% to 18.8 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) in the quarter versus analysts' 18.89 billion yuan estimate. Baidu has been able to offset some weakness in advertising revenue thanks to momentum in its non-online marketing business, largely boosted by its AI Cloud segment. The company, like tech peers, has diversified into autonomous driving as well as artificial intelligence, with its Ernie large-language model powering products such as a ChatGPT-like chatbot as well as its search engine. Its Ernie platform now handles 1.5 billion daily user queries and interactions versus 600 million in August. Baidu warned however its margins would be in a \"period of adjustment\" in the near term, as it was prioritising improving the user experience especially for its AI search business over monetization. The AI and autonomous driving initiatives were essential to sustaining its position as a leading technology innovator in China, it said. Overall, the company's revenue reached 33.56 billion yuan for the three months ended Sept. 30. That compared with the 33.43 billion yuan average of 20 analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG.",
