    "title": "Governo pede que CBF suspenda futebol por chuvas no RS; conselho de clubes deverá ser acionado - Estadão",
    "text": "O Ministério do Esporte encaminhou ofício à [CBF ](https://www.estadao.com.br/tudo-sobre/cbf-confederacao-brasileira-de-futebol/)nesta sexta-feira em que solicita a paralisação do futebol brasileiro em função das chuvas que assolam o Rio Grande do Sul. O documento é assinado pelo ministro André Fufuca e não estabelece prazo de interrupção das competições. “Diante da catástrofe que se segue, a solicitação se faz necessária muito além dos estádios de futebol, campos de treinamento, concentração e local físico onde todos envolvidos no esporte circulam, mas por todas as pessoas, familiares e seus entes que se doam neste momento na sobrevivência e reconstrução de casas e tudo mais afetado”, diz o ofício. Leia também “Por todo o exposto, estas são as razões da presente solicitação, para que seja paralisado do Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol deste ano de 2024″, segue o documento. O ofício chegou à entidade no início da tarde, no momento em que o presidente da CBF, Ednaldo Rodrigues, acompanhava a [convocação da seleção brasileira para a disputa de dois amistosos e da Copa América](https://www.estadao.com.br/esportes/futebol/dorival-junior-convocacao-selecao-brasileira-copa-america-npres/). Ao saber do pedido, Ednaldo declarou que o documento seria avaliado, mas deixou claro que uma eventual suspensão do [Brasileirão ](https://www.estadao.com.br/tudo-sobre/campeonato-brasileiro-de-futebol/)não depende apenas da vontade da CBF. “A gente respeita muito todos os segmentos do governo, Porém, toda a conjunção do futebol brasileiro está em um conselho técnico de clubes. Isso envolve todas as competições”, declarou Ednaldo. “O poder da CBF não é um poder supremo e absoluto.” O dirigente reiterou o que dissera minutos antes da convocação, de que a paralisação do futebol nacional depende da aprovação dos clubes envolvidos nas competições. “A CBF, quando define uma competição, faz reuniões de conselho técnico da Série A, da B, da C, da D, e também das competições de base. Se pediram uma paralisação, nós vamos dar conhecimento a cada clube, a cada série desses clubes, para que eles possam se posicionar com relação ao documento do Ministério do Esporte”, afirmou o Ednaldo. Até o momento, a CBF apenas anunciou que os jogos dos times gaúchos em todas as divisões do futebol nacional estão adiados até pelo menos dia 27 de maio. Apesar da chuva ter diminuído nos últimos dias e os níveis de água nas cidades baixados, o Rio Grande do Sul ainda vive uma situação caótica e o aeroporto Salgado Filho, afetado pelas enchentes, seguirá sem operar pelo menos até o dia 30 de maio. Os CT’s de [Internacional](https://www.estadao.com.br/tudo-sobre/inter-sport-club-internacional/) e [Grêmio](https://www.estadao.com.br/tudo-sobre/gremio/), bem como os estádios dos times, estão submersos na água. Em entrevista ao Estadão, Alessandro Barcellos, presidente do Inter, disse: [“Não imagino futebol nesse momento. Estamos preocupados em salvar vidas”](https://www.estadao.com.br/esportes/futebol/nao-imagino-futebol-nesse-momento-estamos-preocupados-em-salvar-vidas-diz-presidente-do-inter/). Diversos jogadores dos times gaúchos se colocaram na linha de frente e estão ajudando as autoridades no resgate das vítimas.",

    "text": "Special Assistant to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Population Welfare, Malik Liaqat Ali, has emphasized that ensuring access to family planning and reproductive health services was a top priority for the provincial government. This initiative aims at curbing the alarming increase in the province population. Addressing a one-day seminar organized by the Population Welfare Department on World Population Day, Malik Liaqat Ali highlighted the need for public awareness regarding population control. He called upon scholars and intellectuals to play an active role in educating the youth about family planning to prevent rapid population growth. The seminar was attended by Secretary Population, Mutasim Bilah, Director General Population, and other officials from the department, as well as people from various walks of life. In his address, Malik Liaqat Ali stated, “The main purpose of celebrating this day is to draw people’s attention to the problems arising due to population growth and lack of resources. The solution to the economic and social problems of the growing population is essential. All efforts for development and prosperity prove futile when every member of society lacks access to basic needs. For Pakistan to develop and stand among the developed countries, sustainable and effective family planning must become a part of the national security model.” He further added that controlling the population growth is crucial for maintaining a good and prosperous life. He pointed out that Bangladesh, which once had a higher population than Pakistan, has successfully controlled its population growth through effective strategies and the support of religious circles. Pakistan’s population will double in the coming years if not addressed, posing significant challenges for both families and the government. Overcrowded cities and poor maternal and child health are among the issues that will arise. “The relationship between population growth and socio-economic development is well established. Our neighboring and Muslim countries have progressed manifold by investing in family planning and reproductive health. Our progress does not match that of countries where these investments have been prioritized. We are lagging behind in many development indicators compared to our neighboring countries,” Malik Liaqat Ali noted. He reiterated the provincial government’s commitment to family planning and reproductive health, despite the challenges ahead. He stressed the importance of partnership and cooperation with the government, people, relevant departments, and non-governmental organizations to achieve sustainable population growth for the province development and prosperity. “We are here to serve, and we will work for the welfare of the people as much as we can,” he said. He assured that the government is committed to ensuring that people receive their rights, and that any kind of abuse or corruption will not be tolerated in government offices, following a zero-tolerance policy.

    "title": "SingularityNET awards $1 million in global AI grants",
    "text": "SingularityNET has distributed over $1 million in Deep Funding grants to developers globally to support the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) aimed at benefiting humanity.\nThe funding has been awarded to 16 projects across 18 categories, involving individuals from Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Argentina, Russia, the UK, the USA, Portugal, and Brazil. These projects cover a range of topics including neuro-symbolic architectures and quantum computing, all utilising SingularityNET's OpenCog Hyperon framework.\n\"Quantum computing offers the potential for unparalleled computational capability and the means of overcoming thermodynamic barriers limiting conventional chips,\" said Elija Perrier, a project co-owner from Brisbane, Australia, who received $80,000 for research into quantum computing's role in AGI. \"However quantum mechanics represents a fundamentally distinct ontological paradigm compared with its classical counterpart. Understanding the conditions upon which quantum-native AGI may be possible remains uncharted territory.\"\nRob Freeman from the UK received $80,000 for his work on neuro-symbolic deep neural network architectures. He noted, \"It's great that SingularityNET is exploring more diverse means of funding truly novel ideas. Research both in universities and large companies has become very siloed. Our new global connectivity opens avenues of research and collaboration never before possible.\"\nDr Ben Goertzel, Founder and CEO of SingularityNET, expressed the motivation behind the initiative: \"When we launched our RFP with $1.25 million in grant funding across 14 critical challenge areas, we had a bold vision: to accelerate the development of AGI through our groundbreaking OpenCog Hyperon architecture, the innovative MeTTa programming language, and the SingularityNET platform.\"\nHe added, \"We were humbled and inspired by the depth, creativity, and technical brilliance of the proposals we received. Each proposal represented not just a potential technological solution, but a glimpse into the collective human potential to shape the future of artificial intelligence.\"\nDr Goertzel emphasised the scheme's inclusive nature, stating, \"The diversity of participants brings unique, global perspectives to our mission, fostering an inclusive approach to solving complex AGI challenges, which has always been one of our core principles.\"\nThe evaluation process for DeepFunding focused on the technical strength of the proposals and their integration potential with SingularityNET's technologies to contribute to the broader AGI strategy.\nThe awarded projects also included contributions from Nils Kakoseos in Sweden, receiving $70,000 for ternary sheaf networks, and Seb Wiechers from the Netherlands, who was granted $27,000 for developing a corpus for training large language models in SingularityNET's MeTTa programming language.\nSingularityNET's initiative is part of a global movement to develop beneficial AGI solutions, reinforcing the platform's support for state-of-the-art AGI research and fostering a collaborative innovation ecosystem.\nDr Ben Goertzel concluded, \"The journey toward beneficial artificial intelligence is a collective endeavour. Together, we are pioneering a future where innovation will know no limits, and the collective potential of human creativity will meet the transformative power of artificial intelligence.\"",

    "text": "Santé : \"pour former plus de médecins\", le numerus apertus supprimé \"le 17 juin\", annonce le ministre Yannick Neuder\nPublié le\nInvité ce jeudi de France Inter, Yannick Neuder, ministre de la Santé, annonce qu'il va \"supprimer le numerus apertus, pour former plus de médecins, le 17 juin\". La proposition de loi, votée en décembre dernier à l'Assemblée nationale, est \"inscrite à l'ordre du Sénat\" à cette date.\n\"Pour former plus de médecins\", le ministre de la Santé annonce qu'il va \"supprimer le numerus apertus le 17 juin\". Invité de France Inter ce jeudi, Yannick Neuder précise que cette proposition de loi, qu'il a lui-même portée alors qu'il était député et votée en décembre 2023 à l'Assemblée nationale, est \"inscrite à l'ordre du Sénat\" à cette date. Le numerus apertus, qui a succédé au numerus clausus, \"est encore beaucoup trop restrictif\", estimait le ministre en mars dernier.\nCe système consiste à admettre un nombre minimum d'étudiants en deuxième année de médecine, en fonction des capacités d'accueil des organismes de formation. \"On va le supprimer et on fera en fonction des besoins des territoires\", indique Yannick Neuder. \"On pourra aussi rapatrier tous les étudiants français qui sont partis étudier en Roumanie, en Belgique pour qu'ils reviennent en France. Il y a trop de besoins en France\", rappelle le ministre.\nPasser de 500 à 600 internes en psychiatrie par an à partir de 2027\nLe ministre veut faire en sorte que ce volume de nouveaux médecins formés permette \"d'avoir davantage d'étudiants en psychiatrie\", alors que le gouvernement a dévoilé mercredi un plan pour tenter de mieux repérer et soigner les troubles psychiques et rendre plus attractive cette discipline auprès des étudiants. Yannick Neuder veut passer de 500 à 600 internes en psychiatrie par an à partir de 2027 et faire en sorte \"que chaque étudiant en médecine et en paramédical puisse effectuer un stage durant son parcours de formation en psychiatrie\". \"La psychiatrie ne doit plus être le parent pauvre de l'hôpital\", déclare-t-il.\nLe ministre de la Santé a également appuyé la nécessité de former davantage de personnels \"de l'Éducation nationale\", du \"monde associatif\" ou encore \"du monde économique dans les entreprises\" pour \"dépister au mieux\" les jeunes en difficulté. Il souhaite que \"nous ayons 300.000 personnes formées aux gestes de secourisme mental\", \"contre 165.000 personnes formées jusque-là\".\nPour réduire les temps d'attente souvent très longs pour une prise en charge dans les Centres médicaux psychologiques (CMP), Yannick Neuder évoque notamment la possibilité de créer des \"coupe-files\" pour prendre en charge un jeune \"une fois qu'il a été repéré par des troubles de son comportement\". Sur la question du financement de ce plan, le ministre précise qu'il y a \"des budgets pour la santé mentale\", citant notamment des postes de médecins et d'infirmières scolaires \"budgetés\", même s'il reconnaît que \"ce n'est jamais suffisant\".\n- ici\nSur le même thème\nSanté mentale : le gouvernement dévoile un plan pour mieux repérer, soigner et rendre la psychiatrie plus attractiveMieux repérer les troubles psychologiques dans les établissements scolaires, former plus de professionnels et créer une psychiatrie de proximité : le gouvernement a dévoilé son plan sur la santé mentale ce mercredi soir, qui comprend une trentaine de mesures.\nYannick Neuder, ministre de la Santé, est l'invité de Ma France ce mardi sur ici. Il a réagi aux résultats de la grande consultation citoyenne \"Ma France : comment être mieux soigné en France\".\nLe\nLes députés ont adopté, mercredi, l'article de loi visant à réguler l'installation des médecins sur le territoire. Si l'ensemble du texte est adopté, en mai, les médecins devront obtenir l'aval de l'ARS pour s'installer. Dans certaines zones, un médecin ne pourra s'installer que si un autre s'en va.\nMalgré la grève des médecins, les députés mayennais Yannick Favennec et Guillaume Garot poussent pour la régulationMayenneLes médecins et les internes sont en grève ce lundi pour dire non à la régulation de l'installation des médecins. Une proposition portée à l'Assemblée nationale notamment par les députés mayennais Guillaume Garot et Yannick Favennec.",

    "text": "ROMA – La crisi della Marelli di Sulmona approda in Parlamento, con l’intervento della deputata Alleanza Verdi e Sinistra Elisabetta Piccolotti.\n“Dopo la visita della scorsa settimana davanti ai cancelli della Marelli – spiega in una nota Daniele Licheri , segretario regionale di Sinistra Italiana – la nostra deputata Elisabetta Piccolotti è intervenuta in Aula a denunciare la situazione di crisi occupazionale ed economico-sociale e, come avevamo già detto ai lavoratori, farà un’interrogazione per chiedere l’apertura di un tavolo ministeriale specifico per lo stabilimento di Sulmona”.\n“Lavoratori in cassa integrazione o addirittura senza stipendio, mancanza di investimenti”: su questi punti è intervenuta in Aula la deputata AVS Piccolotti.\n“La scorsa settimana sono stata a Sulmona, davanti all’impianto della Marelli che produce componentistica per il Ducato di Stellantis – ha detto la deputata Piccolotti -: ho incontrato lavoratori e lavoratrici molto preoccupati e che vivono condizioni molto difficili. In queste ore stanno scioperando. Da molto tempo lavorano con contratto di solidarietà e per quanto riguarda gli addetti alle pulizie, molti di loro non ricevono lo stipendio perché la ditta che è subentrata nell’appalto si rifiuta di anticipare la cassa integrazione che nel frattempo l’Inps non sta versando alla ditta”.\n“In sciopero i lavoratori delle pulizie. Crisi occupazionale e mancate prospettive, sotto attacco. Ci sono lavoratori che non riescono ad arrivare alla fine del mese e un declino occupazionale particolarmente grave se si pensa che, se è vero che il settore dell’automotive è in crisi, non sono calate così tanto le vendite dei veicoli commerciali e in particolare del Ducato, per il quale a Sulmona si producono i pezzi. Stellantis ha spostato la produzione in un impianto polacco e lasciato l’impianto abruzzese privo di commesse significative”.\nLa parlamentare AVS denuncia “l’assenza di un tavolo specifico presso il Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico”.",

    "title": "**Thomas Tuchel Takes Helm as England Manager: A New Chapter in Coaching**",
    "text": "Introduction to a New Era Starting Friday, a fresh chapter in English football begins.\nThomas Tuchel, a German football manager, is set to become the England national team’s third non-British coach, following in the footsteps of Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.\nUnder the previous leadership of Gareth Southgate, the team achieved remarkable milestones, reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and finishing as runners-up in the Euros in both 2021 and 2024.\nNow, at 51 years old, Tuchel has signed an 18-month contract with a daunting mandate: to qualify for and claim victory in the 2026 World Cup.\nHe is eager to make an impactful start, with upcoming qualifying matches against Albania and Latvia scheduled to be held at Wembley.\nFans are curious about what style of play and tactics Tuchel will implement, given his successful management experiences with esteemed clubs like Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, and Bayern Munich.\nTo gain insight into Tuchel, BBC Sport has interviewed colleagues and acquaintances who have had significant interactions with him.\nA Journey from Bartending to Coaching Standing tall at 6 feet 4 inches, Tuchel transitioned from a player to a manager after an injury cut short his career at the young age of 25. His initial playing days included a stint at Stuttgarter Kickers followed by three years at SSV Ulm, where he ultimately encountered a serious knee injury.\nRalf Rangnick, who coached him during his time at Ulm, noted Tuchel’s curiosity and eagerness to learn. Rangnick recalled, “He always questioned the reasons for our practices. It was apparent he had the potential to become a coach.”\nIn 2000, Tuchel was reportedly working in a bar to sustain himself, a surprising fact for Rangnick when he became head coach of Stuttgart. Recognizing Tuchel’s talents, he reached out to him, suggesting he take a position coaching a youth team. Thus, Tuchel’s coaching journey began.\nRangnick commented, “It was evident he deserved to be on the pitch, not serving drinks.”\nA Bright Mind Tuchel’s dedication and intelligence have been recognized by many in football. He began cultivating his coaching skills by training Stuttgart’s youth teams, eventually leading their under-19 squad to a league title.\nHis first official managerial role started in 2007 at FC Augsburg II, and by 2009, he had taken over at Mainz in the Bundesliga, continuing a legacy that includes having Jurgen Klopp as a predecessor.\nRangnick wasn’t surprised by Tuchel’s rise to prominence, stating, “He possesses the fundamental qualities needed in a manager.”\nDuring his tenure at Mainz, Tuchel was responsible for securing European qualification twice, even achieving the club’s highest Bundesliga finish at fifth place.\nFormer Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger observed Tuchel’s continuous quest to learn from other managers, incorporating elements of their strategies into his own philosophy, particularly focusing on both defensive and offensive play.\nOvercoming Doubts Taking on the managerial role at Borussia Dortmund in 2015, Tuchel had the challenge of winning over a team still adjusting to the departure of Jürgen Klopp. Initial skepticism from players like İlkay Gündoğan himself was transformed into respect and admiration through Tuchel’s clear communication and tactical acumen.\nAccording to Gündoğan, “He articulated his vision for our style of play effectively, and he demonstrated his plans throughout the season.”\nTuchel won his first major trophy at Dortmund with a DFB Pokal victory shortly before his abrupt departure from the club. Gündoğan emphasized the positive experience he had with Tuchel, praising his tactical and interpersonal skills.\nHitzlsperger suggested that Tuchel’s adept manner with players will be crucial in adapting seamlessly into his new role with England, stating, “Players are familiar with foreign coaching styles, and Tuchel has proven to be a top-tier manager.”\nA Complex Yet Successful Coach Known for his complex personality, Tuchel has faced challenges in previous roles at Dortmund and Bayern Munich, often resulting in confrontations with club management. Former Mainz executive Christian Heidel remarked, “Good coaches often have demanding expectations, which can be challenging to navigate.”\nTo succeed with the England setup, Tuchel must maintain a positive rapport with the Football Association, steering clear of prior issues he faced at club levels where disagreements emerged over player transfers.\nAs the new England manager, Tuchel has already made notable decisions, such as recalling seasoned players and including new faces into the national squad, indicating his intent to rejuvenate the team.\nAiming for Success Hitzlsperger believes Tuchel’s coaching experience and innovative football style will reinvigorate England’s national squad, making it exciting for fans. With the 2026 World Cup in view, Tuchel aims to become only the second manager after Sir Alf Ramsey to lead England to victory in the tournament.\nHitzlsperger speculated, “Tuchel would relish the opportunity to face Germany. Defeating Germany in a World Cup match would be an extraordinary achievement for him.”\nAs the England team embarks on its new journey under Tuchel’s guidance, the country watches with hope for a promising future on the pitch.",

    "text": "Our Best Stuff From the Last Week Before Iowa\nHello and happy Sunday! I hope you’re staying warm if you’re somewhere that is experiencing Arctic temperatures this weekend. And if you’re in Iowa, I hope you’re enjoying all the out-of-towners.\nTomorrow is the day we’ve been anticipating for about a year. Fried food has been eaten, hands have been shaken, babies have been kissed. Now the voting begins. We’ve done a lot of reporting on—and from—Iowa the last few months, so I wanted to round up some of our latest work for you to peruse while you’re enjoying the NFL playoffs or huddling under a blanket listening to the wind howl.\nJohn McCormack\nwrote a piece we published Friday that really gets to the heart of the conundrum Donald Trump presents: Iowa Republicans are overwhelmingly evangelical, evangelicals are overwhelmingly pro-life, and Donald Trump has been … overwhelmingly critical of the abortion restrictions such voters favor. And yet he leads in Iowa by 30 points. John talked to Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa evangelical leader who is influential in the state (he backed the winner of the last three competitive Iowa caucuses, and he has endorsed Ron DeSantis this year) about this state of affairs, and what it means for the pro-life cause.\n“It’s one thing to appoint three justices that lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but if you’re critical of the heartbeat bill … how do you call yourself pro-life at that point?” Vander Plaats told John.\nJohn writes: “Mainstream GOP governors, such as Brian Kemp in Georgia and Kim Reynolds in Iowa, have demonstrated that Republicans can sign heartbeat bills into law and still cruise to re-election. But if Trump’s stance on the issue is rewarded with a decisive victory in the 2024 GOP primary, that could change the calculus for other Republican officials going forward.”\nWednesday was such a busy day that we did a\nbonus Thursday edition of the Dispatch Politics newsletter. First off, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dropped out of the race. Christie has never really been a factor outside of New Hampshire, and the threat he presented in that state was to Nikki Haley, not Trump. His departure is likely to help Haley, but he couldn’t resist some barbs on the way out. Before his speech, a recording emerged in which he said that, “She’s going to get smoked” and “She’s not up for this.” Meanwhile, DeSantis also took aim at Haley on Wednesday as the two met for a CNN debate—and Haley’s supporters took it to mean she’s in good shape: “She had to spend a lot of her time tonight being able to defend her record because Ron DeSantis was lying about it,” said Austin Harris, a Republican member of the Iowa House of Representatives who has endorsed Haley. “… His campaign is slipping. He’s in deep trouble.”\nWhile Christie was dropping out and Haley and DeSantis were debating, Donald Trump took part in a Fox News town hall. On Thursday, Nick\nexamined the confluence of events and came away discouraged: “Each of those three events showcased a different strategy toward Trump’s looming renomination. Denial, in the Haley/DeSantis debate,” he writes. “Resistance, in Chris Christie’s farewell speech. Accommodation, in Fox’s handling of its event with Trump. All three strategies are failures.”\nOn Friday, the Dispatch Politics gang\nreported that Haley is confident of a second-place finish on Monday, and they took a little break from the horse-race stuff with an item on the ethanol lobby. Iowa’s first-in-the-nation status and the attendant attention from candidates has been a boon to the industry, but that might be coming to an end for a few reasons. From the newsletter: “Democrats’ abandonment this cycle of Iowa caucuses have reduced corn growers’ grip on the primary process from full nelson to half nelson. Industry insiders spoke in dark tones from the stage about President Joe Biden’s strategic path for renewable fuel development—a strategy predicated not on burning biofuels, but on electric vehicles.”\nLastly, Stirewalt\nfiled from Clear Lake, Iowa, where he took shelter after Interstate 35 was closed because of blizzard conditions. His topic? Fittingly, how the weather might affect turnout. “A low-turnout caucus? I’m in love,” he writes. “When you shrink the pool of participants, weird things happen. I don’t mean to suggest that I think Trump is going to lose, but when the difference between a commanding victory at 51 percent and an embarrassing 39-percent plurality is just 13,000 voters or so, there’s a lot of potential for surprises.”\nIowa wasn’t the only story of the week, of course. Two stories we published this week show how the war between Israel and Hamas has implications from the family level to the global stage. Reporting from Israel, Charlotte continues to provide an important perspective on how the war is affecting Israelis, and Katherine Zimmerman explains how the recent ISIS bombing of Iran ties into the larger crisis in the Middle East.\nCan Displaced Israelis Go Home Again?\nKibbutz Sufa was one of the lucky ones. Hamas terrorists killed only three residents on October 7, a fraction of the toll at nearby Kibbutz Nir Oz. But residents face the same difficult decision that tens of thousands of others living in the “Gaza envelope—areas of southern Israel within a few miles of the Gaza border” are grappling with: Can they ever go home? “For many southern residents, once again living side-by-side with Gazans without a decisive Hamas defeat is a non-starter,” Charlotte writes. “This new mindset is in sharp contrast to the pre-war sentiment in many left-leaning kibbutzim, which were home to many peace activists.”\nWhy the Islamic State Bombing in Iran Should Have Western Leaders Worried\nWhat does a terrorist bombing in Iran that killed nearly 100 at a ceremony mourning the death of Qassem Suleimani have to do with the war between Israel and Hamas? The Islamic State’s Khorasan branch, based in Afghanistan, claimed credit and has announced a new campaign in support of the Palestinians. But why attack Iran, which has backed Hamas? Katherine Zimmerman explains: “Unlike al-Qaeda, the Islamic State has actively targeted Iran and Shiites worldwide as perfidious enemies of Islam and ruthlessly condemned Sunni collaborators such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.” She also warns there are wider implications for Western leaders. “The Islamic State’s signature ability to identify, recruit, and activate would-be terrorists—essentially finding the lone operatives who need only to be told where, when, and how to attack—may prove especially dangerous in this reenergized global threat environment,” Zimmerman writes.\nAnd here’s the best of the rest:\n- Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed a bill that would have banned a broad range of gender-transition treatments for minors (and kept transgender athletes from competing in girls sports), opting instead for a more limited executive order banning transition surgery for minors. But the Ohio House overrode the veto. Audrey Baker\nexplainswhat’s in the bill and how Ohio compares to other states that have passed similar laws.\n- Back in 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?” Fast forward to 2024, and one of his lawyers made a real argument that Trump could order the military to take out a political rival and he’d be immune from prosecution. In The Collision, Sarah and Mike\nnotethat’s probably a losing argument. But they also note that special counsel Jack Smith’s concession that there might be some cases where presidents are immune is likely to extend the pre-trial period in the January 6 case.\n- Pope Francis recently spoke out against the practice of surrogacy. In a heartfelt piece that included a description of her own struggles with infertility, Emily Zanotti\nexplainedwhy the pope was right to condemn surrogacy.\n- In Wanderland, Kevin\ntalks toPano Kanelos, the president of the University of Austin, which is set to welcome its first class of students next fall. The school has a robust free speech policy and seeks to present an alternative to institutions that have been captured by the DEI movement. “If a significant problem in higher education is political asymmetry tilted toward one side, the solution isn’t to build institutions on the other side,” Kanelos told Kevin. “It is to find a way to transcend the political spectrum.”\n- On the pods: If you’re dying for more details on Trump’s lawyer’s argument that he can order assassinations of political rivals, don’t miss Sarah and David’s\ndiscussionof the matter on Advisory Opinions. Andrew calls into The Dispatch Podcast to describe just how cold it is in Iowa, and the gang also talks about Nikki Haley, U.S. strategy in Yemen, and more. And on The Remnant, Jonah is kicking himselffor sitting through the entire Haley-DeSantis debate on Wednesay.",
