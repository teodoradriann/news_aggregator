    "title": "Long-awaited public school funding changes to materialize next fall, province confirms",
    "text": "The years-long wait for Manitoba’s new public school funding formula is almost over.\nThe Education Department has confirmed changes to the existing model — which is more than 30 years old — will go into effect for the 2025-26 academic year.\n“A new formula won’t make the pie bigger, but there’s countless opportunities for making (funding) more easily understood, more streamlined and more responsive,” said Alan Campbell, president of the Canadian School Boards Association.\nRUTH BONNEVILLE / FREE PRESS FILES\n“A new formula won’t make the pie bigger, but there’s countless opportunities for making (funding) more easily understood, more streamlined and more responsive,” said Alan Campbell, president of the Canadian School Boards Association.\nSuperintendents and school trustees have repeatedly raised concerns about inequity in the funding model introduced in 2002-03, and a companion equalization method that they say perpetuates inequities.\nMany have called for multi-year funding instead of waiting for a yearly announcement in late January.\nCampbell, a longtime trustee in the Interlake, was among the initial review team created three years ago. At the time, the father from Stonewall oversaw the Manitoba School Boards Association.\nWhile noting the recent switch in government, he said a modernized equation has been “a long time in the making.” Stakeholders are cautiously optimistic about what to expect, Campbell added.\nFormer premier Brian Pallister’s government first announced a planned overhaul in November 2021 and set a goal of introducing an update that would “simplify funding,” “better support specialized learning needs” and “create predictability” ahead of 2023-24.\nOne year later, in the leadup to an election year, then-education minister Wayne Ewasko, now the interim leader of the opposition Tories, postponed the project indefinitely.\nWhile the NDP did pledge to follow through with the initiative, it has been in limbo throughout the first year of the Kinew government.\nEnrolment figures, transportation needs and building costs, among numerous line items, dictate how much money each of Manitoba’s 38 school divisions get.\nBoards also rely on local property education taxes — amounts that vary among regions because they reflect the assessed value of area housing and businesses — and fundraising efforts to provide basic instruction and programming.\nIn order to tie boards over during the transition period, Manitoba Education has tweaked the model slightly in recent years and redistributed funds from wealthier districts to poorer ones that have fewer big businesses within their borders.\nGiven the complexity of the formula, the government’s current financial situation and all of the politics involved, Maples-area school trustee Greg MacFarlane said the “buzz” is that the changes won’t be as significant as initially anticipated.\n“I hope I’m wrong; I’d like to be wrong,” said MacFarlane, a father in northwest Winnipeg.\nLord Selkirk School Division Supt. Jerret Long said he’s hoping for “a smattering” of updates, including more dollars to support students with disabilities and maintain or expand school nutrition.\n“For us, it has been a gamechanger,” Long said about his division’s new programming under the NDP’s “universally accessible” school food program.\nIts two designated community elementary sites, Ruth Hooker School and Robert Smith School, have been providing daily lunches to more than 400 students combined this fall.\n“Funding should match aging infrastructure. We have some old, old, old buildings, so what’s the plan to address some of those (challenges)? That’s something we’d love to see in the funding formula,” Long said, adding that costly capital projects go beyond the scope of what can be covered through local taxation.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter The Warm-Up Winnipeg Jets Game Days\nOn Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions. Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop.\nSign up for The Warm-Up Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . Historically, dollars earmarked for operating expenses and infrastructure needs have been separate.\nA spokesperson for the office of Tracy Schmidt, acting education minister, said details about the new model are being finalized, so there was no update to provide Thursday.\nPC education critic Grant Jackson said his party wants to see “fairness in funding,” especially for rural school divisions with smaller populations than urban ones and greater school bus needs.\n“Just because you’ve got less kids in a school division or your school division isn’t growing quickly in terms of population doesn’t mean that the buses can be any less safe, that the fuel costs any less dollars,” said the MLA for Spruce Woods.\nmaggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Somerset County Gazette",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Under a banner that read “Bethlehem’s Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santa figures, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence. Bethlehem’s mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address: “Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it’s a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip.” Dr Joseph Mugasa, a paediatrician, was one of the few international visitors. He said his tour group of 15 people from Tanzania was “determined” to come to the region despite the situation. “I’ve been here several times, and it’s quite a unique Christmas, as usually there’s a lot of people and a lot of celebrations,” he said. “But you can’t celebrate while people are suffering, so we are sad for them and praying for peace.” More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.

    "title": "Trump warns of enemies ‘within our country’ to Christian media gathering",
    "text": "Donald Trump addresses the National Religious Broadcasters convention in Nashville, Tennessee, on 22 February 2024. Photograph: Kevin Wurm/AFP/Getty Images\nDonald Trump told a warmly receptive gathering of religious broadcasters on Thursday that “it’s the people from within our country that are more dangerous than the people outside”, in his latest effort to mobilize Christian fundamentalists who have swung dramatically behind him in recent years.\nTrump’s speech in Nashville, Tennessee, to the National Religious Broadcasters presidential forum gala offered him a chance to pitch himself to hundreds of Christian media figures whose approval – and willingness to carry his message on air – could drive huge turnout in November.\n“The greatest threat is not from the outside of our country – I really believe it is from within,” said Trump, whose fire-and-brimstone speech focused largely on his political enemies. “It’s the people from within our country that are more dangerous than the people outside.”\nThe former president’s relationship with the religious right has shifted since his unlikely bid for the presidency in 2016, when his campaign was met with deep skepticism from conservative Christian leaders who had initially thrown their support behind Ted Cruz.\nTrump has since consolidated support among Christian fundamentalists. In 2016, in exchange for the support of prominent conservative pastors, he offered them a direct hand in policymaking through an evangelical advisory board, giving rightwing Christian religious leaders unprecedented access to the White House.\n“In my first term I fought for Christians harder than any president has ever done before,” said Trump. “And I will fight even harder for Christians with four more years in the White House.”\nIn his speech, Trump promised to create a new taskforce to counter “anti-Christian bias” by investigating “discrimination, harassment and persecution against Christians in America”. He vowed to appoint more conservative judges, reminded the audience of his decision to break with decades of international consensus and move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and assured them a future Trump administration would take particular aim at transgender people – for example, by endorsing policies to restrict access to gender-affirming healthcare.\nThe event brought together key figures in the former president’s coalition, from the president of the Heritage Foundation to the hard-right former head of the Alliance Defending Freedom, Michael Harris.\nA nonprofit and tax-exempt organization, National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) is prohibited from campaigning directly for any candidate for public office, a fact that its president, Troy Miller, mentioned during his opening remarks. Trump was nevertheless the star of the show, with speakers lavishing him with praise in an atmosphere similar to one of his campaign rallies.\n“Appearing on a stage before Donald Trump is like opening for the king himself, George Strait,” said the Heritage Foundation’s president, Kevin Roberts, to laughter and applause. “If you do well, everyone will be very nice. If you do poorly, no one will remember anyway.”\nThe event spotlighted the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a “presidential transition project” that envisions reshaping the executive branch to maximize the president’s power. Many fear Trump’s first acts should he win office would be to enact revenge on his political enemies, deport immigrants en masse and roll back legal protections for LGBTQ+ people.\nIt also highlighted the central role that Christian fundamentalism would play in Trump’s second term in office, with Miller declaring: “One of the most dangerous falsehoods spread today is the separation of church and state.”",
