    "text": "New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is set to contest the 2024 Lok Sabha polls on the issue of Hindutva by projecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the 'Hindu Hriday Samrat', Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Friday.\nIn a post on X, Tharoor noted that Modi is set to inaugurate the Ram temple in Ayodhya on January 22 and the BAPS Hindu Temple in Abu Dhabi on February 14, following which the general election would be announced.\nThe Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said the Lok Sabha election is shaping up to be a Hindutva versus popular welfare battle, and questions on economic growth, creating two crore jobs a year and putting disposable income into the pockets of every Indian need to be debated.\nSo Prime Minister @NarendraModi will inaugurate the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22nd and the BAPS Hindu Temple in Abu Dhabi on February 14th. I expect elections to be called very soon thereafter.\nThe message is clear. In 2009, Mr Modi was sold to the Indian electorate as…\n— Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) December 29, 2023 \"The message is clear. In 2009, Mr Modi was sold to the Indian electorate as the avatar of economic development, the CEO of Gujarat Inc., who would bring development to all Indians. In 2019, with that narrative collapsing in the wake of the disastrous demonetisation, the Pulwama terrorist attack gave Mr Modi the opportunity to convert the general election into a national security election,\" Tharoor said.\n\"In 2024, it is clear the BJP will now revert to its core message and offer Narendra Modi to the nation as a Hindu Hriday Samrat,\" he added.\n'Hindu Hriday Samrat' literally translates to the emperor of Hindu hearts.\n\"All of this begs the question: what happened to achhe din? What happened to two crore jobs a year? What happened to economic growth that would benefit the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder? What happened to putting disposable income into the pockets and bank accounts of every Indian?\" the Congress leader asked.\n\"These questions will have to be debated in an election that is shaping up to be Hindutva versus popular welfare,\" the former Union minister said.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 29 December 2023, 11:12 IST)",

Some popular equity crowdfunding platforms include SeedInvest, StartEngine, and Wefunder, which allow startups to raise funds by offering equity to investors. For debt funding, platforms like Fundable and Kiva can be effective options. Angel investment platforms such as AngelList and Gust connect startups with accredited investors looking for equity stakes. For traditional venture capital, firms like Sequoia Capital, Accel, and Andreessen Horowitz are well-known, but they usually require a more established business model and traction. Additionally, platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo are great for product-based startups seeking pre-orders and crowdfunding without giving away equity. Overall, the best platform for you will depend on your startup's stage, industry, and funding needs.\nQ: How can I attract angel investors for my startup?\nA: Attracting angel investors requires a combination of networking, a compelling business model, and a solid pitch. Start by building your network in the startup community, attending industry events, and connecting with potential investors through platforms like AngelList. Create a robust business plan that clearly outlines your value proposition, market opportunity, and financial projections. Be prepared to demonstrate traction, whether through customer feedback, sales figures, or a growing user base. Craft an engaging elevator pitch that succinctly communicates your vision and why it matters. Lastly, establish a relationship with potential investors by keeping them updated on your progress and seeking their advice, as many investors appreciate being involved in the journey.\nQ: What is equity crowdfunding and how does it work?\nA: Equity crowdfunding is a method of raising capital for a startup by offering shares of equity to a large number of investors, typically through an online platform. It allows everyday individuals to invest in startups, which was previously limited to accredited investors. The process starts by listing your startup on an equity crowdfunding platform, where you provide details about your business, funding goals, and the terms of investment. Investors can then browse through various startups and choose to invest small amounts, usually in exchange for equity shares. The platform usually handles the legal aspects, investor communications, and fund disbursement. This method democratizes investment opportunities, allowing startups to access a wider pool of potential funding.\nQ: How do I raise capital for my startup?\nA: Raising capital for your startup involves several strategies that can be adapted to your specific business model and growth stage. Start by assessing your funding needs and exploring different sources of capital, including personal savings, family and friends, angel investors, venture capital, crowdfunding, and bank loans. Prepare a strong business plan that outlines your business model, market analysis, and financial projections to attract potential investors. Network with industry peers and attend pitch events to connect with investors. Additionally, refine your pitch to clearly articulate your value proposition and the market demand for your product or service. Leverage online platforms for crowdfunding, and consider applying to accelerator programs that can provide mentorship and funding. Lastly, be persistent and open to feedback, as fundraising can often require multiple attempts.\nQ: What are the advantages of venture capital for startups?\nA: Venture capital (VC) provides several advantages for startups looking to grow rapidly. One of the primary benefits is access to significant funding that can be used for scaling operations, enhancing product development, and expanding market reach. VC firms often bring valuable expertise and industry connections that can help startups navigate challenges and accelerate growth. They also typically invest in startups that have high growth potential, which can provide the necessary resources to achieve ambitious goals. Additionally, venture capitalists often take an active role in the startup's development, offering strategic guidance and operational support. However, it is important to note that VC funding comes with the expectation of a high return on investment, which may lead to pressure for rapid growth and profitability.\nQ: What should I include in my pitch to investors?\nA: When pitching to investors, you should include several key components to make a compelling case. Start with a strong opening that captures attention, such as a personal story or a surprising statistic. Clearly articulate your business idea and value proposition, explaining what problem you solve and how your solution is unique. Include market analysis that demonstrates the demand for your product or service, highlighting your target audience and competition. Provide details on your business model, pricing strategy, and how you plan to generate revenue. Share your financial projections, including sales forecasts and funding requirements. Discuss your team's qualifications and experience, as investors often invest in people as much as in ideas. Finally, conclude with a clear call to action, outlining what you are asking for in terms of funding and what investors can expect in return.\nQ: How can I find the right investors for my business?\nA: Finding the right investors for your business involves research and networking. Start by defining your ideal investor profile based on your industry, funding needs, and business stage. Use platforms like AngelList, Gust, and LinkedIn to identify potential investors who have a track record of investing in startups similar to yours. Attend industry conferences, pitch events, and networking meetups to connect with investors in person. Leverage your existing network to seek referrals and introductions to potential investors. Additionally, consider using social media platforms to reach out to investors and share your startup journey. Tailor your outreach to each investor, expressing why you believe they would be a good fit for your business and how you can add value for them.\nQ: What are the risks associated with startup funding?\nA: Startup funding comes with several risks for both entrepreneurs and investors. For entrepreneurs, taking on investment can lead to the loss of control over the business, especially if investors require significant equity stakes or board representation. There is also the pressure to meet growth expectations, which can lead to hasty decision-making and potential mismanagement. For investors, the primary risk is the possibility of losing their investment, as many startups fail within the first few years. Market volatility, competition, and changes in consumer behavior can all impact a startup's success. Additionally, investors may face liquidity risks, as their funds may be tied up for several years before they see any returns. Understanding these risks is crucial for both parties when engaging in startup funding.\nQ: How does crowdfunding work for new businesses?\nA: Crowdfunding for new businesses involves raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically through online platforms. Entrepreneurs create a campaign on a crowdfunding site, detailing their business idea, funding goals, and what investors will receive in return, which can be equity, rewards, or donations. Potential backers can browse campaigns and contribute funds in exchange for the promised rewards or equity. There are various types of crowdfunding, including reward-based, equity-based, and donation-based crowdfunding. In reward-based crowdfunding, backers receive a product or service, while in equity crowdfunding, they receive shares in the company. Crowdfunding can serve as an effective means for startups to validate their ideas, generate buzz, and secure initial funding without the need for traditional investment routes.\nQ: What are the steps to secure seed funding?\nA: Securing seed funding involves several key steps. First, develop a solid business plan that articulates your business model, target market, and financial projections. Next, refine your pitch to clearly communicate your value proposition and how you plan to use the funds. Identify potential sources of seed funding, which may include angel investors, crowdfunding platforms, or seed venture capital firms. Network to connect with potential investors, leveraging your contacts and attending relevant events. Prepare for meetings by practicing your pitch and being ready to answer questions about your business and market. Once you secure interest from investors, negotiate the terms of investment, focusing on equity stakes and any conditions they may impose. After reaching an agreement, ensure you handle the legal paperwork properly to formalize the investment.\nQ: What are the benefits of using a startup incubator?\nA: Startup incubators offer several benefits for early-stage businesses. They provide a supportive environment where startups can access resources, mentorship, and a network of industry contacts. Many incubators provide office space, which can help reduce overhead costs for new businesses. They often offer educational programs and workshops that cover essential topics like business development, marketing, and fundraising. Access to funding opportunities is another significant advantage, as incubators may connect startups with investors or provide funding themselves. Additionally, being part of an incubator can enhance credibility and attract further investment, as it signals to investors that the startup has received validation and support from established industry players. Overall, incubators can significantly accelerate the growth trajectory of a startup.\nQ: How can I improve my chances of getting funded?\nA: Improving your chances of getting funded involves several strategies. First, ensure that your business plan is comprehensive and well-researched, addressing all potential investor concerns. Focus on building a strong team with complementary skills and relevant experience, as investors often value the people behind the business as much as the idea itself. Create a compelling pitch that clearly communicates your vision and value proposition, and practice it to deliver with confidence. Build a network within the startup community to gain introductions to potential investors and seek feedback on your pitch and business model. Consider participating in pitch competitions or accelerator programs to gain visibility and credibility. Lastly, be open to feedback and willing to iterate on your business model and pitch based on investor input.\nQ: What do investors look for in a startup?\nA: Investors typically look for several key factors when evaluating a startup. Firstly, the uniqueness and viability of the business idea are crucial; investors want to see that the startup addresses a real problem in the market. A strong market opportunity is also important, including a clear target audience and a demonstrated demand for the product or service. The team behind the startup plays a significant role; investors often prefer experienced, passionate, and dedicated founders with a track record of success. Financial projections and a clear business model are critical, as investors need to understand how the startup plans to generate revenue and achieve profitability. Finally, traction, such as customer feedback, sales, or user growth, can significantly influence investor interest, as it demonstrates that the startup is moving in the right direction.\nQ: How can technology aid in startup capitalization?\nA: Technology plays a vital role in aiding startup capitalization in several ways. Firstly, online platforms for crowdfunding and equity investment have democratized access to capital, allowing startups to reach a broader audience of potential investors. Social media and digital marketing enable startups to effectively promote their fundraising campaigns and build community support. Technology can also streamline operations and improve efficiency, making startups more attractive to investors by demonstrating effective use of resources. Additionally, data analytics tools can help startups make informed decisions about their funding strategies and market positioning. Virtual pitch platforms enable entrepreneurs to connect with investors regardless of location, expanding their reach. Overall, leveraging technology can enhance fundraising efforts and improve the chances of securing capital.\nQ: What strategies can help me raise funds online?\nA: Raising funds online can be effective if you employ the right strategies. Start by choosing the appropriate online platform that aligns with your funding goals, whether it is crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, or equity investment. Create a compelling campaign or pitch that clearly outlines your business idea, market potential, and funding needs. Use engaging visuals, such as videos and infographics, to capture attention and convey your message effectively. Leverage social media to promote your campaign and engage with potential investors, sharing updates and success stories to build credibility. Develop an email marketing strategy to reach out to your network and encourage them to share your campaign with others. Lastly, consider offering attractive incentives or rewards to motivate contributions, and keep your audience updated on your progress to maintain interest.\nQ: How do I evaluate different investment platforms?\nA: Evaluating different investment platforms requires careful consideration of several factors. Start by examining the platform's track record and reputation in the industry. Look for platforms that have successfully funded businesses similar to yours and read reviews or testimonials from other entrepreneurs. Assess the fees associated with the platform, including any commission or percentage taken from funds raised, as these can significantly affect your overall funding goals. Consider the platform's audience and reach; platforms with a larger and more engaged investor base may provide better opportunities for funding. Review the legal and regulatory compliance measures in place to protect both investors and entrepreneurs. Finally, evaluate the support services offered by the platform, such as mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities, which can enhance your fundraising experience.\nQ: What is the role of equity in startup financing?\nA: Equity plays a crucial role in startup financing as it represents ownership in the company. When startups raise funds by offering equity, they give investors a stake in the business in exchange for capital. This can be an attractive option for startups, as it allows them to access significant funding without incurring debt or monthly repayments. Equity financing can also align the interests of founders and investors, as both parties benefit from the company's success and growth. However, giving away equity means sharing control of the company, which may lead to dilution of ownership for founders as they raise more capital in future funding rounds. Understanding the implications of equity financing is essential for entrepreneurs as they navigate the fundraising landscape.\nQ: How can I leverage social media for investment opportunities?\nA: Leveraging social media for investment opportunities involves building a strong online presence and engaging with potential investors effectively. Start by creating profiles on major platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, where you can share updates about your startup and its progress. Use social media to tell your story, highlighting your mission, achievements, and any traction you have gained. Engage with followers by responding to comments, sharing relevant industry news, and participating in discussions. Utilize targeted advertising on social media to reach potential investors who may be interested in your sector. Consider hosting live Q&A sessions or webinars to connect with your audience and answer their questions. Lastly, use social media to network with other entrepreneurs and investors, as many funding opportunities arise from personal connections.\nQ: What are common mistakes to avoid when seeking funding?\nA: When seeking funding, several common mistakes can hinder your chances of success. One major mistake is failing to prepare a comprehensive business plan and pitch. Investors want to see a clear understanding of your market, competition, and financial projections. Another mistake is underestimating the importance of networking; relying solely on online applications can limit your opportunities. Additionally, many entrepreneurs fail to tailor their pitches to the specific interests and preferences of potential investors, which can lead to disengagement. Overvaluing the company or asking for too much funding can also deter investors, as they may perceive it as unrealistic. Lastly, neglecting to follow up with investors after initial meetings can result in missed opportunities. Being aware of these pitfalls can help you navigate the funding landscape more effectively.\nQ: How can startups effectively pitch to venture capitalists?\nA: Effectively pitching to venture capitalists (VCs) requires preparation and understanding of what VCs look for. Start by researching the VC firm to understand their investment focus, portfolio, and criteria.

    "title": "The Church Will Always Triumph",
    "text": "Several years ago, I visited the church and convent of Santo Domingo in Lima, where St. Rose of Lima (1586-1617) once lived and prayed. Beautiful Sevillian azulejos—a form of Portuguese and Spanish painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework—covered the walls of the main cloister. On one such azulejo, passersby can spy a date: 1606, one year before the founding of the English colony of Jamestown, Virginia.\nBefore Pocahontas and John Rolfe, before Puritan colonists, and well before conscientious objector William Penn, Spanish Catholics had already created an impressive Catholic civilization in the Americas. By 1575, a century before the first printing press was established in British America, books were printed in Mexico City, not only in Spanish, but in twelve languages. Before the founding of Harvard, there were three universities in the Spanish Americas. Almost a century before the first school of dissection was opened in England in 1769, anatomy and surgery were being taught with dissection at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico.\nSome of the above details, I confess, I did not know until I read prolific writer H.W. Crocker’s\nTriumph: The Power and the Glory of the Catholic Church, this year updated and expanded to account for the last two decades of tumultuous Church history. It is an excellent introduction to the history of the Catholic Church, one that even widely-read Catholics will likely admit contains fascinating details and stories of which they were previously ignorant. Though it is an account of Catholic frustrations and failures, it is also a story of the Church’s unflagging survival and success in spite of tremendous odds. And as proved by this year and all its Catholic controversies—synods on synodalities, bishops removed from office, and spats between pope and cardinals—we are in sore need of stories that reinvigorate our trust in the Church’s ultimate victory.\nOrthodox. Faithful. Free.\nSign up to get Crisis articles delivered to your inbox daily\nCrocker supplies that confidence in abundance, in large part because he is such a good storyteller, beginning with his prologue, a description of Constantine’s victory at the Milvian Bridge in 312 that led to the legalization of the Christian religion across the Roman empire.\nConstantine’s men were sleeping when the Praetorians burst upon them, piercing their unprotected bellies with swords or pilums—six-foot lances tipped by eighteen inches of steel. While Constantine’s vanguard struggled to protect itself, the legionnaires farther back hurriedly donned their breastplates and helmets, grabbed their arms, and ran to rescue their comrades.\nThis is no staid treatment of Christian history weighed down by overly academic prose. A chapter on the early church arrestingly begins: “Origen severed his genitals.” That’s true, and a bit surprising—the early Church father became famous for his non-literalist interpretation of Scripture, so one wonders what led him to so literally interpret Jesus’ words: “[There] be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” Perhaps the castrated Origen had buyer’s remorse?\nEvery chapter is peppered with these kinds of interesting anecdotes, which are especially welcome when trying to maintain the reader’s interest in the alternatively boring or bizarre pontificates of the medieval period. Stephen VI (896-897), for example, had the disinterred corpse of his predecessor Pope Formosus (891–896) brought before what became known as the “Cadaver Synod” and subjected the hapless corpse to a mock trial. John XII (955-964) in turn was accused of such immorality that the Lateran Palace was labeled a brothel; he is alleged to have died while committing adultery, possibly defenestrated by the cuckolded husband.\nNot, of course, that Crocker’s narrative is all blood, guts, and gossip. In truth, it’s quite a first-rate, extensively-researched history, as the select, critical bibliography makes clear. And Crocker is impressively well-read, citing not only many a sizeable cache of the expected ecclesial historians and theologians but writers as far flung as Ambrose Bierce (a great Civil War-era author and journalist), Gertrude Himmelfarb (an accomplished historian of modern Britain), and Allen Tate (a poet and member of the so-called Southern agrarian movement).\nAs the title suggests, Triumph foregrounds the many glories and achievements of the Catholic Church through twenty centuries of history. Many readers will likely have a cursory knowledge of some of these, but it’s worth appreciating how many times the Church seemed destined for oblivion: Roman persecution, the rise of Islam, the crisis of the three popes, the Protestant Reformation, the French Revolution, and the spread of communism among them. It’s not that these historical events weren’t costly—they were, often disastrously so. In the course of a single century, the majority of the global Christian population (and three patriarchates) fell under Muslim rule. The French Revolution and its aftermath not only created many thousands of Catholic martyrs, but it also brought the “eldest daughter of the Church” to her knees, never to recover.\nYet every time the Church has appeared close to destruction, it has prevailed. The Reformation ended Christendom and cut millions of Europeans away from the Church; but only a few years later, a vision of Mary in Mexico City served as a catalyst for the baptism of millions of indigenous Americans. Totalitarian regimes crushed much of Catholicism in central and eastern Europe, yet a Polish pope who grew up under Nazi and Soviet rule survived both and inspired millions of the faithful to “put out into the deep.” Catholicism today withers away in its traditional heartlands of Spain, France, and Italy, but it thrives in Africa and Asia, a consequence (in part) of missionary efforts from those same European countries many years before.\nBut I’m just touching the wavetops here. Crocker’s history shows Catholic triumphs in ecclesiology, theology, and politics, as well as art, literature, and science, proving that in every generation it has been the Church that best exemplifies not only virtue and piety but truth and beauty. Thus, Triumph ends in exhortation: “In the third Christian millennium there are powerful new challenges that only the Church can overcome—namely the challenges of science and technology to human integrity.” Anyone following debates over abortion, surrogacy, or transhumanism knows it is the Catholic arguments that are the most robust and humane.\nA close friend—once a nominal Catholic, now a prayerful father of five—once told me that the first edition of Triumph dramatically altered his appreciation for the Catholic Church. Surveying so many heroic lives driven by a singular love for Christ, how could it not? One hopes Crocker’s updated edition will do the same for a new generation of Catholics. As he closes: “Man can find his own future. We can only work and pray that he does so with the lamp of Christ held high.”",

    "text": "Winter storm warning: Map shows 17 states on snow alert as up to 18 INCHES to fall Two different storm systems are set to bring heavy snowfall across northern regions throughout the weekend, with a massive 18 inches possible in some parts. Winter weather warnings are in effect for parts of 17 states as two distinct storm systems promise heavy snowfall across New England and northern regions throughout the weekend. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued winter storm warnings spanning [Alaska](/latest/alaska), [California](https://www.the-express.com/latest/california), [Maine](/latest/maine), [Minnesota](/latest/minnesota), [Montana](/latest/montana), [New Hampshire](/latest/new-hampshire), [New York](https://www.the-express.com/latest/new-york), and [Vermont](/latest/vermont). Additionally, advisories are active in [Connecticut](/latest/connecticut), the Dakotas, [Illinois](/latest/illinois), [Iowa](/latest/iowa), [Massachusetts](/latest/massachusetts), [Michigan](/latest/michigan), [Nevada](/latest/nevada), and [Wisconsin](/latest/wisconsin). According to the latest forecast, a weather front is poised to generate snow showers over the Midwest and Great Lakes on Friday, with a subsequent shift into the Ohio Valley. This movement is expected to unleash a swath of heavy snow across areas downwind of Lake Ontario and into New England. Some parts of New England have already witnessed late-winter snow due to a previous storm earlier in the week, with forecasts predicting up to a foot of additional snowfall in the region by Sunday morning. READ MORE: [Texas power grid collapses after huge thunderstorms plunging 100K into darkness](/news/us-news/132009/texas-power-outage-Houston-thunderstorm) In Maine, an additional [18 inches of snowfall is anticipated](/latest/snow), accompanied by winds of up to 40 miles per hour, leading to areas of blowing snow and reduced visibility. Ice is also expected, creating hazardous road conditions. Similar conditions are forecast for [New Hampshire](/latest/new-hampshire), where up to 18 inches of snow, along with sleet, ice, and winds reaching 35 miles per hour, are anticipated. Vermont and [New York](https://www.the-express.com/latest/new-york) could see as much as 17 inches of snow, posing the risk of scattered power outages due to the weight of the snow on tree limbs. [Vermont](/latest/vermont) is also expected to experience a 10th of an inch of ice accumulation. In Massachusetts and Connecticut, up to two inches of snow is expected, along with ice accumulations of up to a 10th of an inch. Moving westward into the Great Lakes region, Michigan may see up to seven inches of snow, while Wisconsin anticipates up to six inches. Similar snowfall is forecast for northern border counties of Illinois and northeastern Iowa, with five to six inches expected. Central Minnesota could witness up to seven inches of snow, with southeastern North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota likely to see six inches and one inch, respectively. DON'T MISS: Simultaneously, another system is poised to bring unsettled weather to the West, with heavy rainfall predicted along coastal areas and up to four feet of snow in mountainous regions. As this system progresses, it is expected to weaken over the Rockies on Saturday before redeveloping into a significant winter storm over the Front Range by Sunday. Earlier this month, [powerful winter storms from the Pacific and Intermountain West regions brought substantial snowfall](/latest/weather) to various areas, including the Sierra Nevada range, the Rocky Mountains, and neighboring states. Residents are urged to stay informed of weather updates and exercise caution as these storm systems unfold, with potential impacts on travel and daily activities.
