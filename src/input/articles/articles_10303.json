    "text": "Illegal organ trafficking is big business, and vulnerable people are at risk. Could an ethical organ trade solve this?/ Fiona Pepper and Damien Carrick for the Law Report In the 1990s, there was a terrifying urban myth about a person going to a party, being drugged and waking up to find their kidneys have been snatched and traded. At the time, organ donor programs were horrified about the false story. But in recent years, international organisations have become increasingly concerned about the \"hidden\" crime of the commercial trade in human organs. Many experts believe this is big business in some countries. Vulnerable people, mostly in developing nations, sell their kidneys to patients, many of whom travel from more affluent countries such as Australia. Reliable figures on the illegal trade are hard to track down but, in 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 5 per cent of all transplants performed worldwide were illegal . And living kidneys — the organ most commonly in demand — are the most highly reported traded organ. While it's commonly believed the illegal organ trade is underground, experts argue the opposite is actually happening. \"The trade is quite deeply embedded within the medical sector and other legal industries,\" Frederike Ambagtsheer, an organ trafficking researcher, criminologist and assistant professor at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam (one of the largest kidney transplant centres in Europe), tells ABC RN's Law Report . \"One cannot perform an illegal transplant without the involvement of highly specialised medical staff, infrastructure and equipment,\" Professor Ambagtsheer says. Illegal trafficking rings In March 2023, [ Nigerian senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife were convicted in a high-profile case of organ trafficking](/news/2023-05-06/uk-court-jails-nigerian-senator-for-kidney-harvesting-plot/102312084) when they attempted to purchase a kidney for their daughter. \"[Their daughter] was on dialysis in the UK, she was living there, she needed a kidney and they tried to traffic a prospective young kidney seller to the UK in order to harvest his kidney and have that be donated to their daughter,\" Professor Ambagtsheer explains. The case came to light when a Nigerian man from Lagos went to police saying he had been trafficked to the UK in order for his kidney to be harvested. Senator Ekweremadu was sentenced under Britain's modern slavery act to more than nine years in jail. The senator's wife and doctor were also jailed. While this case demonstrates the illegality of the organ trade, Dominique Martin, professor of health ethics and professionalism at Deakin University, says the majority of the trade is embedded within legitimate transplant programs. \"Each case is supposedly reviewed by a transplant ethics committee and approved as being legitimate and free of commerce,\" Professor Martin explains. However, she explains, in most cases it's only when the individual selling the kidney goes to police that \"it's revealed that there's been a trafficking ring taking place\". In recent years, Professor Martin says there have been several organ trafficking rings busted throughout India and the Philippines. She says it's only occasionally that there are reports of more underground operations. \"There was a horrific report in Pakistan where there was a surgeon who was operating in private hotel rooms and houses, the person administering the quasi-anaesthetic to the patients was in fact a mechanic … but that kind of real backwoods stuff is the exception,\" she says. What is being done to curb the trade? Commercial trade in human organs is currently illegal in all countries except Iran . However, there are no restrictions on Australians travelling overseas to receive an organ transplant. \"We don't currently have what they call extra-territorial jurisdiction covering the laws that in Australia prohibit trade in organs,\" Professor Martin explains. For example, if an Australian was to illegally purchase an organ in the Philippines, they could be prosecuted there but not under Australian law. Last year, a private members' bill focusing on Australians who travel abroad to buy organs was put before federal parliament . \"So the essence of the bill is that there would be a declaration that passengers coming into Australia would be required to make, attesting to whether they had received an organ transplant while they were overseas … in the past five years,\" Professor Martin says. The rationale behind this is that individuals would disclose if they had received a transplant overseas, which would prompt further investigation. Professor Martin is sceptical of this approach. \"The first stumbling block [is] what would be the motivation for someone to disclose that information and how confident could we be that the majority were disclosing?\" she asks. An all-party parliamentary committee recommended the bill not be passed, instead calling on the federal government to deliver more public awareness campaigns. Professor Martin believes a more effective approach would be to create a mandatory reporting system for doctors, which would focus on collecting data rather than information that identifies patients. This is an approach supported by both the WHO and the United Nations. A 2019 study, led by the University of Adelaide, surveyed transplant professionals working in Australia. It asked them specifically about providing care to patients who had received transplants overseas. More than half of the doctors surveyed had treated patients who had returned from overseas after having had a transplant. Professor Martin points out the majority of patients who travel for transplants have done so legitimately. For example, they could be returning to their home country to receive a transplant and be cared for by family. \"Not all cases of travel for transplant actually involve organ trafficking,\" she says. An ethical organ trade Professor Ambagtsheer is focused on researching the most effective incentives to increase both deceased and living organ donations, specifically kidney donations. \"It might help to reduce the black market abuses within the organ trade but also help us increase the supply, so that there is less incentive on the black market for people to trade and sell,\" she says. Professor Ambagtsheer also advocates for the exploration of an ethical organ trade. The main stipulation would be that \"you never allow patients to pay\". She says the model would require anonymous donation and full government oversight. \"The government would be the institution that gives an incentive to kidney donors, so there is no transaction between donors and recipients …. I think that would be an ethical way of incentivising organ donations,\" Professor Ambagtsheer says. She says the incentive would not necessarily be cash, but could instead be something like free health insurance. However, Professor Martin is fundamentally opposed to the suggestion \"on both ethical grounds and also practical grounds\". She says countries like Spain, a world leader in donation and transplantation rates, can provide better solutions. \"They've done that, not by relaxing the ethics or taking ethical shortcuts or exploiting people; [instead] they've had a government that's really invested in the donation program,\" Professor Martin says. \"They've had a really concerted effort to engage the community and they're doing a lot of interesting things in terms of optimising the recovery of organs from as many potential donors as they can.\" Both Professors Martin and Ambagtsheer remain concerned for the welfare of those who sell their kidneys or other organs. \"They don't receive appropriate after care, they're very often cheated in terms of the money that they were promised and they experience all kinds of financial, physical and psychological distress because of the deception that we see inside these black markets,\" Professor Ambagtsheer says. She says a criminal justice approach to reducing the illegal organ trade often results in the prosecution of the kidney seller as there is a reluctance to prosecute \"the medical elite\". \"I don't think that the system that we have in place is really serving those we are aiming to protect,\" she says.

    "text": "Internacional Retiran a Otis y Dora de la lista de nombres de huracanes debido a su gravedad. Foto de EFE Retiran a Otis y Dora de la lista de nombres de huracanes debido a su gravedad\nLa OMM informó que retiró a Otis y Dora de la lista de nombres de ciclones tropicales que se utilizan en la cuenca del Pacífico Norte oriental debido a su gravedad\nmarzo 21, 2024 El Comité de Huracanes de la Organización Meteorológica Mundial ( OMM ) informó que retiró a Otis y Dora de la lista rotativa de nombres de ciclones tropicales que se utilizan en la cuenca del Pacífico Norte oriental debido a su gravedad, tanto por el número de víctimas que causó el primero en Acapulco, como por el impacto indirecto del segundo en los devastadores incendios de Hawái.\nLa decisión se tomó durante la cuadragésima sexta reunión del Comité, que se está celebrando esta semana en Ciudad de Panamá, según detalló la OMM en un comunicado.\nEl huracán Otis fue la tormenta más fuerte de la pasada temporada, que tocó tierra cerca del turístico Acapulco el 25 de octubre como huracán de categoría 5, con vientos sostenidos de 260 km/hora (160 mph), convirtiéndose, de acuerdo con la organización, “en el huracán más fuerte jamás registrado en tocar tierra en el Pacífico oriental”, causando al menos 51 muertos y 34 desaparecidos, y unas pérdidas de unos 3 mil 200 millones de dólares.\nPor su parte, aunque Dora , que alcanzó una intensidad de categoría 4, no fue tan intenso como Otis, su paso el pasado agosto por el sur del archipiélago de Hawái estuvo “indirectamente relacionado con los catastróficos incendios forestales de Maui”, al avivar las llamas.\nEl nombre de Dora, explicó la OMM, ya había sido retirado de la lista que se utiliza para designar los ciclones tropicales de la cuenca del Atlántico en 1964.\n“En su lugar, Otilia y Débora se añadirán a la lista de nombres, que la OMM supervisa y cuya finalidad es ayudar a comunicar los avisos de tormenta y alertar a la población de riesgos potencialmente mortales. Existen seis listas que se emplean de forma rotativa, por lo que los diversos nombres que las conforman se reutilizan cada seis años, a menos que una tormenta sea tan mortífera que se decida retirar su nombre”, explicó el organismo.\nA lo largo de 2023, se registraron 20 tormentas con nombre en la cuenca del Atlántico y 17 en la cuenca del Pacífico oriental. El Comité no retiró ningún nombre de las listas de la cuenca del Atlántico , algo que no sucedía desde 2014, anotó.\nOtros de los puntos en los que se está centrando el Comité durante su reunión en Panamá , añadió, es en el aspecto operativo, sobre todo en la “emisión de predicciones y avisos sobre peligros asociados a vientos, precipitaciones, mareas de tormenta e inundaciones, así como el suministro de evaluaciones de su impacto”.\n“El trabajo del Comité de Huracanes es fundamental para garantizar que todos los habitantes de la región comprendida entre la cuenca del Atlántico y la del Pacífico oriental estén preparados para la temporada de huracanes de 2024 y minimizar los efectos de estas peligrosas tormentas sobre la vida y los bienes”, afirmó, de acuerdo con el comunicado, el presidente del Comité de Huracanes, Michael Brennan.\nLa secretaria general de la OMM , Celeste Saulo, recordó por su parte en un discurso en vídeo dirigido a los participantes de la reunión que “2023 fue el año más caluroso jamás registrado (y) si bien es cierto que la formación de un episodio de El Niño en el océano Pacífico contribuyó a ello”, también se observaron “niveles sin precedentes de calentamiento oceánico en el Atlántico Norte y el Atlántico tropical; una tendencia que persiste en 2024”.\nEsto propició, según la OMM , que la actividad de la temporada de huracanes fuera superior a la media, contrarrestando los efectos típicos de un episodio de El Niño , que tiende a reducir el número de estos fenómenos meteorológicos.\nCon información de EFE",

    "text": "Latest Weather Blog One arrested for felony hit-and-run after Central big rig crash last week CENTRAL - One person was arrested for causing an 18-wheeler to overturn on Hooper Road Friday night. Police arrested Joseph Montgomery for a felony hit-and-run after his vehicle crossed the center line into oncoming traffic, causing the driver of the 18-wheeler to swerve into a ditch. The Central Police Department responded to a crash on April 19 that left an 18-wheeler overturned with the driver trapped inside. It took hours for first responders to get the driver out of his vehicle, and police said they were shocked and thankful that no one was killed. Dashcam video obtained by police from the 18-wheler showed a 2016 GMC Sierra entering the opposite lane. Right after, the big rig veers to the shoulder and overturns. Another video from a flock camera showed the same truck hitting the camera on Greenwell Springs Rd. Thursday , Central Police said they knew who was driving the vehicle and that they should \"consider turning [themselves] in.\" \"Our suspect turned himself in, gave a brief statement, was cooperative,\" Assistant Chief Cliff Ivey said. \"A judge later signed a warrant for the charge of felony hit-and-run, and he is being booked into parish prison.\" Trending News Police say the crash also caused a power outage for several hours and into the next morning.

    "text": "World famous artists designed this carnival in 1987. Nearly 40 years later, it's back If you visited Hamburg, Germany in the summer of 1987, you might have been one of the lucky 250,000 people to attend [Luna Luna.](https://lunaluna.com/learn/the-story/) It was a carnival designed by some of the most famous artists of the 20th century. Visitors got to ride a small Ferris wheel adorned with drawings by Jean-Michel Basquiat. They could waltz inside a cylindrical pavilion created by David Hockney. They could wind through Roy Lichtenstein's pop art glass labyrinth, with music by Philip Glass; Fairgoers could also walk inside a mirrored geodesic dome decorated by surrealist Salvador Dalí, and they could ride a carousel painted with bright graffiti figures spray painted by Keith Haring. Now, thanks to the rapper Drake, his studios and some investment partners, [Luna Luna has been revived](https://lunaluna.com/) in Los Angeles. Who thought this would work? \"I thought the idea sounded great because it is, in a way, something that has been a fantasy of mine since the first time I went to Disneyland or went to amusement parks in America when I was a kid,\" the late Keith Haring said in 1987 in a documentary about the park. Luna Luna was the brainchild of Austrian multimedia artist André Heller — an avant-garde poet, singer and impresario. He was known in Europe for his hot air balloon sculptures, acrobatic circuses and firework spectacles that could be seen over the Berlin Wall. \"Creating an amusement park out of art was an early desire,\" Heller says in the documentary. \"And we had to find the right artists in the right combination.\" Heller managed to convince 33 of the world's top contemporary artists to be a part of Luna Luna. Among them, American Kenny Scharf. \"He came just out of the blue and like, it sounded very far-fetched, but I'm like OK, great. And I loved doing it,\" recalls Scharf. \"I really believed it was going to be this giant thing that was going to send me to the moon — you know, the art world moon.\" Scharf remembers spending three weeks in a cold warehouse in Vienna customizing sculptures and a giant swing ride with his cartoon figures. \"Of course, I was into it,\" he says. \"It fit perfectly with my philosophy for art then and now, which is art is not only for a wall with a frame in a gallery, a museum or above a couch; Art can be everywhere and should be. And art can be something that you experience and that you actually sit on and you swing around and it's fun.\" German artist Monika GilSing remembers designing flags for Luna Luna. \"It was like a small miracle that an art world was created that people had never seen before, and it was very exciting to see art in this context,\" she says through an interpreter. \"On the other hand, art critics — it seemed like they still needed some time to recognize what was going on, because it was such a new way of presenting art.\" The park closes Luna Luna closed down after just three months, dashing Heller's grand plans to tour the park around the world. \"It was an absolute masterpiece,\" he recalls in the documentary. \"I had it in my hands, and I let it slip away.\" Details of exactly what happened are as muddy as the fairgrounds had been that rainy German summer. Michael Goldberg, a creative director in New York, says some fundraising deals fell through, and then Heller went back and forth with an American foundation that wanted to bring Luna Luna to San Diego. \"The foundation basically tried to back out of the deal and it ended up going through litigation in three different courts,\" he says. In the end, everything that was in Luna Luna — dismantled rides, artwork and merch — was packed into 44 shipping containers. They languished on a desert ranch in Texas for decades. Then, in 2020, Goldberg says he learned about the carnival and asked for Heller's blessing to launch Luna Luna 2.0. With Dream Crew, the entertainment company run by megastar Drake and Live Nation as investors he spent $100 million to acquire the shipping containers sight unseen. Goldberg says it was a big risk. \"I was concerned, did I lead somebody into a deal and they were gonna buy a bunch of dust?\" he says. Goldberg remembers shaking nervously when they opened the first container, packed to the brim with posters and T-shirts from 1987. \"Some sort of critters or rodents had gotten in there and basically ripped the product to shreds,\" he recalls. \"And then other pieces of the apparel are in perfect condition.\" He says they were relieved opening the rest of the containers. \"One of the first pieces that came out was one of the figures from the Keith Haring carousel. The work looked like it was painted yesterday.\" With no instruction manuals, the team spent two years meticulously putting the attractions back together. The park is reborn Nearly 40 years after its premiere, Luna Luna has been recreated inside a warehouse in the Boyle Heights neighborhood near downtown Los Angeles. Some of the original performances play on videos at the new exhibition, including an absurd \"fart concert\" that has visitors dumbfounded. Real-life stilt walkers and puppeteers from the Bob Baker Marionette Theater roam around the reconstructed, indoor park grounds. Visitors are not allowed to touch the rides, but just like in 1987, visitors can still take their (unofficial) vows at the wedding chapel Andre Heller created for Luna Luna. \"This was André Heller's idea that you could get married to whomever or whatever you wanted,\" says curatorial director Lumi Tan. \"In 1987, [that] was very radical, in a time when gay marriage wasn't legal.\" She says today, like then, gay couples can get pretend-married (and pretend divorced) at Luna Luna. So can large groups of friends. \"People were marrying family members and pets and inanimate objects,\" says Tan. \"A photographer married his camera, for example.\" Kenny Scharf says Luna Luna was ahead of its time, and when it folded in 1987, André Heller was completely crushed. So was he. \"It wasn't like I forgot about it,\" Scharf says. \"I never forgot about it, in fact, I never stopped talking about it.\" Scharf, who lives in Los Angeles, says he hopes one day visitors will be able to fly around on his swing ride again. And from Hamburg where she still lives, GilSing, says she would love to see her flags flapping in the wind outside again. The new owners do have plans to take Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy on the road, so you never know. The park's run in Los Angeles will close on May 12. Copyright 2024 NPR.

    "title": "MultiVersus Update Promises Smoother Netcode, Online Play at Launch",
    "text": "MultiVersus Update Promises Smoother Netcode, Online Play at Launch MultiVersus reveals online updates coming with its full launch. Last year, publisher Warner Bros. Games shut down its platform fighter MultiVersus after its open beta period ended. While development was relatively quiet for several months after that, it was eventually announced last month that MultiVersus will [finally have its full launch](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/multiversus-return-date-ps5-xbox-steam/) in May. The developers at Player First Games then started to announce new features and content, including [the new NHL Face-Off](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/multiversus-nhl-face-off-golden-knights-colorado-avalanche/) event that's scheduled for April 14th. Today, the team revealed its first blog post ahead of the May launch detailing many of the online and netcode changes coming to [MultiVersus](/category/multiversus/). It should be great news for fans of the fighter hoping to take their talents into an online arena. MultiVersus Details Netcode and Online Changes The [developers claim](https://twitter.com/multiversus/status/1778493352280764471) that MultiVersus netcode \"has been rebuilt from the ground up\" since the game went dark after the open beta period. During the beta, the netcode was server-based, meaning that animations would sometimes feel off depending on how far away you were from the server. If you didn't have solid ping it was even worse, sometimes making MultiVersus feel unplayable online. The updated netcode now uses rollback netcode that's been \"tailor-made for MultiVersus.\" Generally, rollback netcode is the standard most fighting game fans want nowadays, so it's good to see [MutliVersus take this route](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/multiversus-happy-meal-toys-mcdonalds/). However, it's important to note that because MultiVersus incorporates modes like 2v2 or Free-for-All matches with several players onscreen at once, the team is using its own bespoke netcode to ensure it's up to the platform fighter's demands. There are a ton of technical details the team delves into, but the gist is that your online play should feel much smoother when MultiVersus officially launches. On top of the changes to responsiveness, the team is also using the new netcode to improve matchmaking. Because the previous system was server-based, the game needed to match you with someone who had a similar ping as you. The new netcode should make it much easier for players to seamlessly match up with players who aren't as close to the server, opening matchmaking up to a wider playerbase and hopefully, bringing down the wait times. Of course, this all remains a work in progress, so Player First Games will continue to tweak its netcode even after the game launches. That said, this definitely seems like a great first step for the developer as it tries to make MultiVersus the best online platform fighter it can. MultiVersus is set to launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms on May 28th. Remember, if you're a hockey fan, [the NHL Face-Off game](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/multiversus-nhl-face-off-avalanche-golden-knights-rosters/) takes place on April 14th. Like when Nickelodeon takes over NFL games, it should be a ton of fun. [0comments](#)",

    "text": "In remarks made on a radio interview Thursday, Republican presidential candidate former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley blamed a “Democrat plant” sent by the Biden campaign for the ’cause of the Civil War’ question she botched at a town hall Wednesday night in Berlin, New Hampshire. Haley also gave a do-over answer that blamed slavery for the War Between the States. Later at another town hall, Haley again blamed the slavery. Haley appeared on the Pulse of NH show Good Morning New Hampshire with Jack Heath Thursday morning. The complete audio can be heard at this link . Audio excerpt posted by the DeSantis campaign: LISTEN: Haley embarrassingly attempts to walk back her Civil War flub, explains that she couldn’t answer the simple question because the voter was a “Democrat plant.” Nikki Haley doesn't have what it takes to win. pic.twitter.com/rKnqu96LjB — DeSantis War Room 🐊 (@DeSantisWarRoom) December 28, 2023 Later Haley appeared at a town hall at Kennett High School in North Conway where she again addressed the ’cause of the Civil War’ question: — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) December 28, 2023 Last night I was asked about the Civil War. And what I think of the Civil War, what was the cause of the Civil War?” Of course, the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That’s unquestioned. Always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. but it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government. For eighty years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing? And whether government, economically, culturally, any other reasons, had a role to play in that. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more. But the lessons of what the bigger issue with the Civil War are, is that let’s not forget what came out of that, which is: Government’s role, individual liberties, freedom for every single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone or government getting in your way. That should be the goal of what we always try to take away from that, right? Because we never want to return back to that place but we always want to remember the lesson of what it means to be a free individual and that everyone deserves to be a free individual. So we stand by that. I say that as a Southerner. I say that as a Southern governor who removed the Confederate flag off the statehouse grounds. And I say it as a proud American of how far we have come. Transribed by TGP. The anonymous questioner at the Berlin town hall Wednesday told reporters he asked Haley about the cause of the Civil War because of this 2010 Q & A with the Palmetto Patriots when she was running for governor that did not mention slavery: — PatriotTakes 🇺🇸 (@patriottakes) February 15, 2023 New Hampshire Journal excerpt : The unidentified man later told reporters he asked the question because he heard her answer it in a similar way when she ran for South Carolina governor in 2010. He said he wanted to know if her views had since changed. In 2015, while governor of the Palmetto State, Haley was widely praised for successfully removing the Confederate battle flag from atop the South Carolina state house and to a Confederate monument, resolving an issue that had plagued her state’s politics for years. Haley’s 2010 answer is an apparent reference to an interview she held with a southern heritage activist group, the since-defunct Palmetto Patriots. A video of the interview was released by CNN last February. In the interview, Haley said the Civil War was about two sides butting heads because one side stood for “tradition” while the other supported “change.” Pressed by the heritage group on what that meant, Haley answered, “on individual rights and liberty of people.” Thursday morning, Haley made it clear she believed the Civil War question came straight from Democrats. “It was definitely a Democrat plant,” Haley told Heath. “That’s why I said, ‘What does it mean to you?’ And if you notice, he didn’t answer anything. The same reason he didn’t tell the reporters what his name was. The same reason he went and showed the guy that he was with the tweet that went up after he did it.",

    "text": "López answers the call with career-high velocity ST. PETERSBURG -- The Twins have been running low on star power as they await the end of Carlos Correa’s drawn-out plantar fasciitis saga and seek further updates on [Byron Buxton’s most recent hip setback.](https://www.mlb.com/twins/news/byron-buxton-remains-injured-max-kepler-to-il) But every fifth game still brings Pablo Day -- and boy, do they need this version of staff ace [Pablo López](https://www.mlb.com/player/641154) more than ever. Not only has López left the struggles of his first half behind him, but he’s now dominating with some of the best raw stuff of his seven-year career. His fastball velocity once again soared to unseen heights and his sweeper looked as good as it has all season as López held the Rays to three runs over 6 2/3 innings, pitching the Twins to a [4-3 win](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/745042/final/box) on Thursday at Tropicana Field. “His stuff right now is sharp as it’s been,” bench coach Jayce Tingler said. “It’s this time of the year and this is the most electric we’ve seen him. That’s super encouraging going down the stretch.” The split of the four-game series helped the Twins gain a half-game on the idle Guardians and sneak ahead of the Royals for sole possession of second place in the [AL Central](https://www.mlb.com/twins/standings/), closing the gap to a four-game deficit in the division. López’s scoreless streak came to an end at 23 1/3 innings -- the longest single-season streak by a Twin since Tyler Duffey in 2019 -- and his outing might have been cut short by a nearly 10-minute replay review in the seventh inning. Still, he helped an Edouard Julien three-run blast and Matt Wallner solo shot stand as enough offense. And somehow, as a grueling season nears its end, López is stronger than ever -- especially in his continued recovery from a rough first half in which his stuff was way down at times and he pitched to a 5.11 ERA by the All-Star break. “I think early on in the year, there were panic level meters going off everywhere [outside], and I think in here, the panic level was so low for him just because of the pure worker he is,” catcher Ryan Jeffers said. “I think we knew this was coming. He’s our ace. He’s been our ace. He’s one of the top pitchers in all of baseball and he’s showing that now.” López had never thrown a pitch at 98 mph in his career entering Thursday -- but he threw three of them in this game alone, topping out at 98.6 mph. His sweeper, an inconsistent pitch for much of the year, generated a 70% whiff rate, his second-highest mark of the season. For that, he credits additional attention to the biomechanics of his delivery in his post-start reviews, the extra day of rest he gets between starts to be able to focus his between-games bullpen sessions and everything from the Twins’ nutritionists to their sleep doctors in helping him maximize his body and get his season back on track. “It's definitely a wonderful feeling to see how the stuff is this late into the season, like you said, later into my career,” López said. “We have all those resources, and the least we can do is to ask questions, see what many ways to get better are out there and try them.” Though López wasn’t perfect -- he allowed a two-run, bases-loaded single to Junior Caminero in the third inning and an RBI double to Yandy Díaz in the seventh -- his effective, lengthy outing is exactly what these injury-ridden Twins needed as he pitched the club to victory for the fourth time in his last five outings. They’ve really needed those efforts, too. Playing without Correa and Buxton -- and now, Max Kepler -- the Twins had lost four in a row ahead of López’s previous outing, when he threw 7 2/3 scoreless innings against the Blue Jays to stop the skid. Before that, they had dropped four of five leading into a matchup against the Cardinals -- and then, too, López had stepped up to throw seven scoreless frames. His team needs him now -- and the ace has answered the call. “The team picked me up plenty of times in the first half when I wasn't at my best or my sharpest,” López said. “It's one of those things that you have to take it personal. We were down in the series, and I knew I had an opportunity to come out here and do it for my guys, do it for my teammates. They keep doing it for me.”",

    "title": "UVA Baseball Notebook: ‘Hoos not happy just getting to Omaha again - Augusta Free Press",
    "text": "The [UVA Baseball](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/uva-baseball/) team, in the week leading up to the 2023 College World Series, said all the right things about not just wanting to be happy getting back to Omaha, but, you know. “It was new. A lot of wide-eyed type guys,” coach Brian O’Connor said Thursday, talking with the media after his team’s practice at Charles Schwab Field. Shortstop Griff O’Ferrall admitted that he found himself last year “a little bit in awe and just a little bit in shock just with the atmosphere itself and how many people are in the stands.” This year’s UVA team has O’Ferrall among six lineup regulars who played in the 2023 CWS. O’Connor has been leaning on the veterans to set the tone for the 2024 trip to Omaha. “I did something on Monday every year the day after we qualified for Omaha. I’d take the team through a process of what to expect. I changed something this year, and it’s the first time out of seven times that I’ve done it this way. I asked the players that played in the event last year, some of them, to stand up and speak to their teammates about their experience in Omaha, because there’s a lot that goes on,” O’Connor said. There is, for instance, the shock and awe of playing in front of 24,000 fans, several multiples more than any of the kids has ever played in front of in their young lives. And then there’s the hoopla around the event. I mean, come on, right, it’s the College World Series. “A big one was that all the families come to town, right, and to make sure that they communicate with their families that we are here to win a national championship. You as a player do not need to worry about your families. They’ll be fine,” O’Connor said. Between the families, the media obligations, a chance to spend an off-day at the world-famous [Omaha Zoo](https://www.omahazoo.com/), the important thing to remember is, “it’s about winning, it’s about being prepared,” O’Connor said. “Our main message has just been to not try and do too much. We’re here for a reason. As long as we do the small things and do what we’re capable of, the moment doesn’t get too big,” O’Ferrall said.",
