    "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) extended its recovery for the second straight session on Thursday after shedding 7,923 points in previous sessions, with the benchmark KSE-100 Index gaining 1,188.61 points (+1.95 percent) to close at 62,052.23 points. The market opened on a positive note and remained in the green territory throughout the session, albeit, some profit-taking was witnessed in the last 90 minutes trading. The bulls regained their dominance two days after an all-out rout when the benchmark of representative shares recorded its biggest day-on-day decline. On Wednesday, the stocks regained some of the lost ground amid value-hunting by investors. According to experts, value hunters were in action leading to across the board buying. Moreover, fresh liquidity is being injected as the market enters a new month, they said. They attributed the bullish momentum to “adequate amount of futures positions being rolled over.” They said that the market bounced back sharply during the last two sessions after a correction. They noted that market participants are expecting interest rates to decline in 2024, coupled with a broad-based re-rating of the market. “More than 125 stocks are trading 70pc below the May 2017 market cap in dollar terms. There is a significant valuation gap between Pakistan and other markets and that should keep foreign investors active,” they added. The benchmark index traded in a range of 1,658.5 points, showing an intraday high of 62,750.77 points and an intraday low of 61,092.27 points. Among other indices, the KSE All Share Index gained 883.39 points (+2.13 percent) to close at 41,568.01 points. Similarly, the KMI All Share Islamic Index gained 658.86 points (+2.17 percent) to close at 30,325.24 points. Total volumes traded for the KSE-100 Index decreased by 15.70mn shares to 378.62mn shares against 394.32mn traded in the previous session. However, the overall market volumes increased by 6.88 million shares to 676.24mn shares against 669.36mn shares traded a session earlier. Among scrips, KEL topped the volumes with 62.89mn shares, followed by WTL (46.19mn) and FFL (43.05mn). Stocks that contributed significantly to the volumes included KEL, WTL, FFL, AKBL,and CNERGY, which formed over 34 percent of total volumes. A total of 377 companies traded shares in the stock exchange against 355 in the previous session, out of which shares of 282 closed up, shares of 79 companies closed down while shares of 16 companies remained unchanged. A total of 98 companies traded shares in the KSE-100 Index against 96 in the previous session, out of which share prices of 83 companies closed up, 14 companies closed down and one remained unchanged. The number of total trades increased to 232,377 from 213,260 in the previous session, while the value traded increased by Rs. 4.16bn to Rs. 20.28 against Rs. 16.12bn in the previous session. In terms of rupee, UPFL remained the top gainer with an increase of Rs. 999 (+4.76 pe rcent) per share, closing at Rs. 21,999. The runner-up remained NESTLE, the share price of which climbed up by Rs. 200 (+2.56 pe rcent) to Rs. 8,000. FASM remained the top loser with a decrease of Rs. 20.75 (-5.75 percent) per share, closing at Rs. 340, followed by PSMC, the share price of which fell by Rs. 17.33 (-2.99 pe rcent) to close at Rs. 562.36 per share. The major sectors taking the index towards north remained commercial banks (374 points), oil & gas exploration companies (173 points), cement (160 points), power generation & distribution (121 points), fertilizer (106 points), textile composite (50 points), food and personal care products (45 points), and oil & gas marketing companies (42 points). Ten major companies adding points to the index remained HUBC (66 points), BAHL (59 points), MARI (58 points), LUCK (36 points), OGDC (33 points), MEBL (31 points), MCB (27 points), UBL (24 points), BAFL (23 points), and EFERT (22 points). The major sectors taking the index towards south were technology & communication (35 points), and insurance and automobile assemblers (2 points each). Ten major companies depriving the index of points remained SYS (21 points), PSMC (6 points), KEL (5 points), EFUG and CNERGY (4 points each), and NBP, PTC, FFL, MTL and PRL (3 points each).",

Vainqueurs il y a deux jours de l'Anadolu Efes (88-84), les Parisiens ont verrouillé ce jeudi le Maccabi Tel Aviv (96-83), avant-dernier d'Euroligue, grâce à T.J. Shorts, auteur de son troisième double-double de la saison (11 points, 14 passes et 5 rebonds) en Euroligue.\nL'ÉQUIPE Lors d'un match au dispositif de sécurité très renforcé, classé à hauts risques par la Division nationale de lutte contre le hooliganisme (DNLH, dépendante du ministère de l'Intérieur), au niveau 4 sur une échelle de 5, les Parisiens ont validé leur 13e victoire de la saison lors de cette 22e journée.\nlire aussi Le film de Paris - Maccabi Tel-Aviv Dans une Adidas Arena remplie de 4 750 personnes (la plus petite affluence de sa saison européenne), dont environ 1 500 supporters du Maccabi parqués derrière un panier alors que le kop parisien était bien absent, comme annoncé, Paris a vite pris les devants (12-2, 5e). Les locaux se sont même offert rapidement un écart de vingt points (31-11, 12e) grâce notamment à l'adresse à 3 points de Tyson Ward (18 pts) et Collin Malcolm (11 pts) en fin de premier quart.\nPorté par Marial Shayok (7 pts) et Rokas Jakubaitis (16 pts), le Maccabi est vite revenu (35-25, 15e) avant que Nadir Hifi (15 pts), par un tir à 3 pts salvateur (40 29, 17e) et son jeu offensif rapide et flamboyant, ne sonne le réveil des Parisiens (49-33, 20e), largement dominants au rebond (25 prises contre 14 en première mi-temps).\nlire aussi Calendrier et résultats L'ÉQUIPE Comme en première mi-temps, le Maccabi va connaître un temps fort (64-55, 27e), avant que T.J.

    "title": "UAlbany chemist advances gunshot residue detection with DOJ grant",
    "text": "Igor Lednev, a chemist at the University at Albany, is pioneering a new laser-based technology to enhance forensic investigations involving gunshot residue.\nHis research, which combines Raman spectroscopy with machine learning, aims to provide a faster, more accurate, and non-destructive method for analyzing crime scene evidence.\nLednev's work received a significant boost with a $556,572 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice in January. Lednev said,\nGunshot residue is a complex mixture of particles, including partially burned propellant, primer, and cartridge case materials, that is left behind on hands, clothing, and surfaces following a firearm discharge. It provides crucial evidence in shooting-related cases.\nThe current methods for detecting gunshot residue are often costly, time-consuming, and destructive to samples. Lednev's technology, however, offers a unique solution.\nRaman spectroscopy, a non-destructive chemical analysis, shines monochromatic light on a sample and measures the scattered radiation, producing a unique spectrum akin to a fingerprint.\nThis method allows for nearly instantaneous results while preserving the sample for future testing.\nThe DOJ funding will enable Lednev's lab to test their technique on gunshot residue trapped in common fabrics, which are frequently overlooked in investigations.\nThe research will expand to include small traces of evidence from other surfaces, collected using adhesive methods. Lednev said,\nWe have developed a two-step method for the detection and identification of gunshot residue, first using a highly sensitive fluorescence hyperspectral imaging of a sample area to detect potential particles, followed by confirmatory identification of particles using Raman spectroscopy. Once identification is achieved, we can further our analysis including determining other important information such as the type of ammunition and/or ammunition manufacturer.\nLednev's team, which includes several UAlbany graduate students, plans to develop a portable instrument for on-site crime scene analysis. Lednev said,\nConsidering that handheld Raman spectroscopic instruments are already commercially available, we envision our technology will become portable in the future and put into the hands of investigators at crime scenes.\nThe National Institute of Justice grant will support Lednev's research for the next five years, in collaboration with the New York State Police Forensic Investigation Center in Albany and the Onondaga County Center for Forensic Sciences in Syracuse.\nLednev's lab has been at the forefront of using Raman spectroscopy for forensic purposes for over a decade, with continuous funding from the NIJ, over 60 peer-reviewed articles, and three U.S. patents.\nSupreMEtric LLC, a startup founded by Lednev, focuses on identifying body fluid traces at crime scenes and has received over $1 million from the National Science Foundation to commercialize the technology. Lednev said,\nWe have made significant progress in the development of another tool that can detect and identify body fluid traces for forensic purposes. SupreMEtric LLC is commercializing this patented technology now. We’d like to see our body fluid and gun residue analysis combined into a single instrument, making it a really powerful forensic tool.",

    "text": "Getty Image\nHave you heard of the sportsbooks “DEBET” and “Net88”? Don’t worry if your answer is no, because most people haven’t, and that’s why questions are being raised of two Premier League clubs that have gone into business with them.\nIn recent days, established mid-table Premier League sides Wolverhampton Wanderers announced that DEBET would be the club’s front-of-shirt sponsor for the 2024/25 season, while Crystal Palace inked a deal with Net88.\nThe problem, however, is that both of these sportsbooks appear to be illegal Vietnamese entities, as they not only have virtually non-existent online presence but also may actually be owned by the same people.\nAfter Wolves yesterday, that's two Premier League clubs in two days signing up with illegal Vietnamese gambling firms. https://t.co/OIblHI6vff\n— Martin Calladine (@uglygame) June 12, 2024\nThe English language accounts for DEBET and Net88, for example, have less than 250 followers combined .\nSome digging by football author Martin Calladine also found potential evidence that they are actually the same illegal betting operation , as trademarks for the two companies were filed on the same day: March 13.\nCalladine also found that Net88, Palace’s new sponsor, has a fake CEO using the identity of a dead TikToker and offers betting odds on cockfighting.\nCongratulations to Crystal Palace's commercial team who signed a deal with an illegal Vietnamese betting firm whose founder \"Phạm Minh Châu\" bears a striking resemblance to a Vietnamese TikToker called \"Đặng Ngọc Bích Tuyền\" who passed away in 2023. pic.twitter.com/8PX0abOUW9\n— Martin Calladine (@uglygame) June 12, 2024\n“With previous illegal betting firms having been caught out using made up staff, Wolves’ partner used a freelance British PR consultant to give a quote. NET88, by contrast, seem not to have any named employees,” Calladine tweeted in an extensive thread reporting on the issue.\n“These are not legitimate companies. Their services are by definition illegal. They are often connected to organized crime and horrendous human rights abuses. These firms often pirate sports broadcasts and, as Norwich found out a few years back and Palace are finding out now, advertise their wares with overtly sexual imagery.”\nGiven the numerous (115, to be exact) charges surrounding Manchester City relating to financial fair play, misreported revenues, questionable sponsorship deals, and so on, it’s shocking that the Premier League would allow something like this to happen if all of the accusations made against DEBET and Net88 are true.\nIt’s strange, too, considering that the Premier League is arguably the world’s most popular sporting enterprise, meaning there are surely hundreds if not thousands of legitimate companies that would happily sponsor the likes of Wolves and Palace.",
