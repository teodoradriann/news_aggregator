    "title": "Aragón se vuelca con Palestina: \"Los niños no son terroristas\"",
    "text": "La defensa de la paz y los derechos humanos en Gaza ha vuelto a ser la protagonista en la tarde de este sábado en Zaragoza. Era una tarde fría, pero eso no ha sido óbice para que la capital aragonesa aglutinase las gargantas de más de un millar de aragoneses que han clamado por el fin del «genocidio» en Palestina. En cualquier caso, los zaragozanos no estuvieron solos, en una convocatoria organizada por la Casa Palestina a la que se adhirieron colectivos del Sobrarbe, Alcañiz, Alcorisa, Caspe, Tarazona, Huesca y Borja. Además, se convocaron protestas en otras localidades como Teruel o Morata de Jalón.\nEn la plaza san Miguel, en torno a las 18.00 horas, no cabía un alfiler. Las banderas palestinas eran ondeadas por gente de todas las edades y etnias posibles, lideradas por las pancartas que pedían «libertad» para el pueblo palestino. Tras finalizar la protesta, en la plaza del Pilar representantes de la Casa Palestina han leído un manifiesto por la paz y el fin de los ataques israelís sobre los civiles gazatíes . Una marcha a la que han acudido personas como Fuensanta, una zaragozana que dejaba claro que «los niños no son terroristas» y que estaba ahí en una muestra de «solidaridad».\nEntre las proclamas también resonaba la voz de Chaimae, una joven de origen marroquí que mostraba su esperanza porque estas muestras de cariño «continúen». Con todo, Chaimae no escondía cierta autocrítica: «Me gustaría que hubiese mucha más gente, porque no creo que todo el mundo sepa lo que realmente pasa en Palestina».\nLiliana, por su parte, aseguraba que «merece la pena» su viaje desde Alcañiz hasta la capital aragonesa, «porque hay que parar el genocidio». «Queremos que se vea que la ciudad de Alcañiz está con la gente palestina y su sufrimiento», añadía, mientras reflexionaba que «el conflicto ha pasado a ser una masacre, mientras las instancias internacionales no responden a las expectativas de la paz» . Una sensación que compartía Inés, que también se había desplazado 80 kilómetros para asistir a la marcha. «Me parece que es lo único que puedo hacer para mostrar mi descontento y mi pena» , argumentaba, a la par que incidía en lo «emocionante» de ver a tanta gente congregada desde todos los rincones de Aragón.\nAsimismo, además de las insignias palestinas, un par de banderas sudafricanas han encabezado la concentración, acompañadas de un «¡Gracias!» por llevar al Estado de Israel ante la Corte Internacional de Justicia de La Haya. Todo ello mientras el tiempo apremia y los muertos, que ya se acercan a los 30.000 (la inmensísima mayoría civiles), siguen apilándose bajo los escombros. Algo a lo que tampoco era ajeno nadie: «¡Cada niño muerto, es un niño nuestro!».",

    "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. (WHEC) – There are 1,000 reasons why Jaedon Adams-Griffin is going to be successful after he’s done playing basketball at World of Inquiry School. “It makes me like a bigger brother, proud father, to know he wants to progress in life and he wants to take that next step and go to college. We do something right at World of Inquiry,” said head coach Willie Mason.\nOkay, maybe not 1,000 reasons, but there are quite a few. Adams-Griffin scored his 1,000th career point on Tuesday night in the Griffins’ 78-14 win over Early College.\nAnd no, the Griffins aren’t named after Adams-Griffin, but it suits the team well that he’s their go-to guy.\n“Four years ago until now he just brought a sense of stability, leadership. I’ve been in the district for nine years, probably one of the better players I’ve ever coached,” said Mason.\nAdams-Griffin has clear goals of a championship this season. The Griffins fell short in the Class B1 Sectionals semifinals in 2024, but he’s continued to progress into one of the top players and leaders in Section V.\n“I got more aggressive over the years, defense got better,” said Adams-Griffin.\nAnd his teammates have taken notice.\n“They see the style that he plays and the limit that he sets at all points. They want to live up to what Jaedon do. If Jaedon works this hard let me live up to Jaedon,” said Mason.\nThere’s no doubt he has the skill to lead the Griffins to a deep run in the playoffs. Adams-Griffin can score from all three phases and doesn’t take a play off. It translates to the classroom where he takes school seriously and has his college plans in view.\n“I want to study the body and how it works and stuff. Because I understand, I get hurt a lot in basketball, I want to teach people how not to get hurt, stretch more, and all that,” said Adams-Griffin.\nThe senior hasn’t committed to a school yet, but plans on studying physical therapy and hopes to continues playing basketball.\nAdams-Griffin is a quiet person, but you can’t miss his impact on the court or at World of Inquiry School. Coach Mason called him the “all around definition of a student athlete.”\nSeems like he’s the perfect pick for our News10 NBC Scholar Athlete of the Week.",

Vedang Raina who portrayed the character of Reginald \"Reggie\" Mantle in The Archies, recently featured in an interview with Instant Bollywood. During the conversation, he shared insights into his relationships with co-stars Suhana, Khushi, and Agastya, discussing the aspects he admires and the things he patiently tolerates about them. Vedang Raina Calls Khushi Kapoor 'Generous' In an interview with Instant Bollywood, Vedang Raina talked about his rumoured girlfriend Khushi Kapoor. He shared, “I love the fact that she is always looking around for others and she is very generous. She puts others before herself. Tolerate about her that… I said this before as well, but it is not like really tolerating or something, but it is a fact that I would like to change about her. Something I'd like to change about her is that she goes on a self-doubt trip sometimes. She'd question herself and her abilities. And I would like her to have more confidence in herself.” View this post on Instagram Opening up about working with Suhana Khan, Vedang Raina expressed, “I love the fact that she is very caring for the people around her, and tolerate the fact that she used to take the most time to get ready on set. So, we used to all be waiting for her. Her hair checks would take the most of the time compared to anyone else.” [ALSO READ: Koffee With Karan 8: Janhvi Kapoor On Working With NTR Jr In Devara, 'I Feel Better About Myself'](https://english.jagran.com/entertainment/koffee-with-karan-8-janhvi-kapoor-on-working-with-ntr-jr-in-devara-i-feel-better-about-myself-10124840) He further opened up about his equation with Agastya Nanda. Raina said, “I love the fact that he is very open to becoming friends. He is very easy to be friendly with. We broke the ice on day 1. Our friendship was like a really important part of my journey in the film. And tolerate about him is that he is very bad at texting. So, he does not reply to me very quickly. It may take a day or two for him to get back to me.” Vedang added that Agastya is “a very affectionate person. He will jump on you, touch you, hug you.” [English Jagran.com](https://english.jagran.com/)Jagran English is available on WhatsApp. Join now for latest news from India and around the world.

    "text": "As thousands of families struggle with the cost of putting food on the table, [D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser](https://www.nbcwashington.com/tag/muriel-bowser/) is at odds with members of the D.C. Council and advocates over whether to use nearly $40 million in surplus funds to temporarily increase SNAP benefits. About 140,000 people in D.C. receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance benefits, often called food stamps. Last March, families saw their benefits decrease after federal pandemic relief funding ran out. To fill that gap, the D.C. Council passed legislation that requires the mayor to use about $38 million to increase those benefits for nine months if the District had a budget surplus. The District did end the last fiscal year with a surplus, but so far Bowser has refused to use the funds to increase SNAP benefits. Council members have urged the mayor to comply with the law. Ward 4 Council member Janeese Lewis George called Bowser’s refusal unlawful, and At-Large Council member Robert White said it’s irresponsible.

Bowser pushed back last week, questioning whether putting the $38 million toward SNAP was the best use of the money. “How can we best use that $38 million for the same people?” she asked. “Is this the best way? Is it better to use it for [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families] increases that affect more people? Is it better to use it for a summer benefits program where the federal government can be a partner?” she continued. In an opinion, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb wrote, “The mayor must expend the funds as the council directed and cannot unilaterally use them for another purpose.” Bowser told reporters she’s in talks with council members about how to best use the surplus funds. “We do have some questions that come from our agencies. Should we advance a nine-month benefit that goes away, or should we work on something that's more sustainable for more people?” she said. “Those are our questions, and that's the question I put to the council. I have not advanced the reprogramming, which is why I say nothing needs to be restored, but I do think it’s responsible to have that conversation,” she added.

Some advocacy groups have threatened to take the mayor to court to compel her to put the $38 million toward SNAP benefits. The legislation had called for the SNAP benefits to increase beginning in January, but that seems unlikely, given the mayor has yet to reprogram the surplus funds.",

[Port Harcourt](https://www.legit.ng/tags/port-harcourt-news/), Rivers - The Pro-Democracy Coalition of [Nigeria](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/) has described the embattled caretaker chairman of the All Progressives Congress ( [APC](https://www.legit.ng/tags/apc/)) in [Rivers State](https://www.legit.ng/tags/rivers-state-news-today/), Tony Okocha, as a serial liar in urgent need of attention The group made this known in a statement on Thursday, June 6, while reacting to the claims by Okocha on the [Rivers State](https://www.legit.ng/tags/rivers-state-news-today/) government. aAccording to the statement signed by its President, Comr. Jack Thomas, Okocha has been economical with the truth when it comes to projects inherited in the state. “As a Pro-democratic group that is carefully following events in Rivers State, we can attest to the giant strides recorded by the governor of River State, His Excellency Siminalayi Fubara, in his first year in office,” the statement said. The statement further reads: “So, we wonder how Okocha would describe the administration of His Excellency Siminalayi Fubara as a government in the intensive care unit. “Contrary to claims by the embattled Rivers APC chairman that His Excellency Siminalayi Fubara didn't acknowledge former Governor Nyesom Wike for inherited projects, we wish to draw the attention of Okocha to the statement by His Excellency Fubara during the presentation of his one-year score card last Wednesday at a townhall meeting in Portharcourt where the governor categorically disclosed that, his administration inherited 34 uncompleted road projects worth over 225.279 billion naira spread across 13 local government areas of the state.\" Lawyer lists illegal moves by Governor Fubara Legit.ng [earlier reported](https://www.legit.ng/politics/1594502-rivers-crisis-3-illegal-moves-by-governor-fubara-made/) that the Rivers state political crisis has taken a new dimension, with stakeholders faulting Governor Fubara for alleged illegal actions. Barrister Oladotun Hassan, a legal practitioner, said the state government's demolition of the state assembly was not in accordance with the law. In an interview, Hassan also told Legit.ng that the executive order moving the activities of the state assembly to the executive chamber did not conform with the law.

Los medios y las redes han documentado lo que fue el paso de este Huracán, que tocó tierra en la Bahía de Tampa en horas de la noche del pasado miércoles, proveniente del Golfo de México, dónde adquirió una fuerza que preocupó a los científicos y que provocó una evacuación sin precedentes. Este desastre natural no solo dejó devastación y perdidas millonarias, sino también historias que le han dado la vuelta al mundo. Una de ellas es triste y desafortunada, pues da cuenta de la maldad de algunas personas en medio de una situación tan alarmante. Dejan perro abandonado durante huracán Milton Publicidad Una patrulla de caminos de la Policía de Florida, conocida por sus siglas en inglés FHP (Florida Highway Patrol) hizo un indignante descubrimiento cuando vigilaba una zona en la ruta I-75, Bruce B Downs Blvd, una zona de potreros alejada del área urbana. Allí se detuvieron y se adentraron en uno de los poteros, hasta llegar a una especie de reja, donde estaba amarrado un perro de raza Bull Terrier, de color blanco, completamente mojado y con sus patas sumergidas en el agua, que cada vez subía más por las lluvias. Publicidad Asustado y temblando, el perro fue rescatado por las autoridades y llevado a un refugio, tanto para sobrevivir al huracán, como para buscar un nuevo hogar. En las redes este acto ha sido condenado, pues muchas personas se preguntan cómo es posible que alguien abandone a su suerte a un animal y lo amarre, condenándolo a fallecer en medio del huracán. Este es el video del momento en el que las autoridades rescatan al perro en Florida: FHP Troopers rescued a dog left tied to a pole on I-75 near Bruce B Downs Blvd this morning.

MÉXICO.- El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador aseveró que desaparecer los organismos autónomos sería una “muy buena reforma administrativa” en el próximo Gobierno federal, que iniciará el 1 de octubre. En la conferencia matutina de Palacio Nacional, López Obrador apuntó que con la desaparición de organismos autónomos, el Gobierno se ahorraría un presupuesto de 100 mil millones de pesos al año. “Sería una muy buena reforma administrativa y se ahorrarían como unos 100 mil millones de pesos al año”, declaró. “Y no pasa nada, porque no se despide a los trabajadores, es nada más quitar el copete de privilegios y cortarlo”, externó. El mandatario mexicano insistió que muchos de estos órganos podrían pertenecer a [Secretarías ](https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/2024/07/11/que-ha-hecho-susana-harp-para-sonar-en-la-secretaria-de-cultura/)del Gobierno federal. “Que la función del Instituto de la transparencia pase a Economía, que el Instituto de comunicaciones pase a la Secretaría de Comunicaciones, que todos los institutos u organismos autónomos que tienen que ver con la industria eléctrica y Pemex pasen a la Comisión Federal de Electricidad y a [Pemex](https://www.elimparcial.com/dinero/2024/07/06/empresa-de-carlos-slim-firmo-contrato-con-pemex-para-proyecto-de-gas-lakach/)”, destacó. El tabasqueño aseguró que todos estos órganos autónomos fueron creados para defender intereses creados, y puso como ejemplo el Instituto Nacional de Transparencia, Acceso a la Información y Protección de Datos Personales (INAI). “Es que todo esto lo crearon cuando la idea central del Gobierno era privatizar, entonces necesitaban ese andamiaje administrativo para defender sus intereses”, lanzó. “Ahí está el caso del INAI, el Instituto de la Transparencia, ¿qué caso de corrupción han puesto al descubierto? Nada, pura tapadera, porque además si daba uno a conocer algo está uno violando la privacidad”, enfatizó. Sheinbaum “continuará con la austeridad” López Obrador celebró que Sheinbaum Pardo anunciara que se seguirá con la política de austeridad republicana, implementada en su Gobierno.
