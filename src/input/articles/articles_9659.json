    "title": "Lifetime at the library: Towns honor retiring North Wales Area Library director Jayne Blackledge",
    "text": "NORTH WALES — A local fixture will soon be stepping down, and local officials are celebrating her decades of devotion to the community. North Wales and Upper Gwynedd have both recognized Jayne Blackledge, longtime director of the North Wales Area Library , as she nears the end of a distinguished career. “Later this week, we’ll be celebrating Jayne Blackledge’s retirement from the North Wales Area Library. I’m excited to join that celebration, and I will be proclaiming March 15 as ‘Jayne Blackledge Day’ in North Wales,” said borough Mayor Neil McDevitt. As leader of the library since the late 1990s, Blackledge has seen the library move in 2009 – 10 from a spot inside North Wales Elementary School to a renovated former factory on Swartley Street — supervising subsequent fixes and upgrades in and around the building — and led through the turbulent COVID era when libraries shuttered their doors and shifted to online and drive-up offerings . She’s also overseen countless new library programs and innovations, including free classic books for newborns , new online offerings including daily story time book readings on the library’s Facebook page , courses in sign language , book drives in memory of school shooting victims , free museum passes to local destinations , a ‘Star Library’ designation as one of the best in the state , and a ‘Human Library’ program where visitors can learn from the life stories of others. “Anyone who has visited the library, or ever heard of our library, will know Jayne has been a very huge part of our success,” said borough Manager Christine Hart. A retirement gala in her honor will be held Friday, March 15, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the William Penn Inn in Lower Gwynedd; tickets to the gala are available online or in person at the library. In addition to the Mayoral proclamation from North Wales, the board of commissioners in Upper Gwynedd recognized Blackledge this week , as commissioners President Katherine Carter read a formal recognition proclamation saying the township was “forever grateful” for Blackledge’s 43 years of dedication. “The library offers something for everyone, and that is thanks to Jayne’s dynamic leadership,” she said. Commissioner Greg Moll said he fondly recalled taking his two children there often as they grew up, calling it “a magical experience.” “I can remember my son dressed as a turtle, complete with shell backpack, to go take pictures at the library, and pull out books and read them. For a parent, when we first started going to the library, what a great resource for our community. So thank you to Jayne for everything that she’s done, for the library and for our community, and all the children and all the adults that benefit as a result,” he said. Carter recalled when her daughter, now in her 30s, first filled out a library card application with Blackledge 20-some years ago, “and recently she called, and Jayne renewed her library card for her.” “I said to her the other day, I said ‘She’s retiring,’ and she’s like, ‘What’s going to happen to the library?’ It’ll still be there. So just in small ways, you’ve affected my family, and we appreciate everything,” Carter said. “My grandchildren loved coming there for the human library — they didn’t understand when I said it, they were like, ‘Really? Humans?’ But they really enjoyed it, and I know my neighbor’s four kids really enjoy the library, so we appreciate it, and thank you so much for your years of service,” she said. And former commissioner Martha Simelaro said she thought Blackledge had been the perfect library director: a devoted and welcoming gatekeeper of learning, and leader to uncharted literary territory. “They’re also the stewards of curiosity. They ensure that every seeker finds their direction, not only to facts, but also to wonder,” she said. “They’re also storytellers, and Jayne’s a good one, not just from books but from their own experiences. And then these stories become a part of the library’s lore.” “These are just a few of the things that librarians do, and this is what Jayne has done so well, every day for over 40 years. So tonight we honor Jayne, who lights up our minds and our hearts, and shaped many of our literary journeys. Thank you for making our world richer, one book at a time. We’ll miss you.” As she accepted the proclamation, Blackledge thanked the entire community for their support, and said she’s been “really lucky to spend an entire lifetime” there, including while her mother was the previous library director. “I was raised in the North Wales library. When I was a little girl, I went there…and I volunteered from the time I was in third grade. So, wow, it is near and dear to my heart, and I think it’s near and dear to our entire community,” she said. During that time, she’s worked to make sure the library and its programs are open to all, and is always open to suggestions and feedback from the community. “The library is for everyone in our community, regardless of any factors. We don’t care about age, demographics, nothing matters: we’re all welcome at that library,” Blackledge said. “And that is really a blessing in our community, to have a place where everyone feels valued and welcome. And we’re glad that we can provide that spot. The library will be in good hands, don’t worry.”",

The NEMA had urged citizens, especially nomadic herders and drivers, to exercise caution and take preventive measures against potential disasters.\nThe combination of frigid temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns often leads to devastating consequences for both human and animal populations, Xinhua news agency reported.\nIn a tragic example of such risks, over 10 people, mainly nomadic herders, lost their lives in November 2023 due to heavy snow and blizzards in the central province of Tuv and the eastern province of Sukhbaatar.\nLast winter, nearly all 21 provinces of the country endured extreme wintry conditions, accompanied by record snowfall, the largest since 1975. Around 90 per cent of the country's territory was covered in snow up to 100 centimetres thick, leading to the death of approximately 8 million livestock.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\n[Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/international/40-per-cent-of-mongolias-territory-faces-high-risk-of-experiencing-harsh-winter/)",

    "text": "Prince Harry is reportedly prioritizing a visit to his father, King Charles, upon his return to England in May. The Duke of Sussex is keen on repairing their bond, especially since King Charles was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. A source revealed to The Mirror, &quot;Harry&apos;s first priority when he comes to England is to see his sick dad. He is pretty focused on this. It will be his first port of call when he comes off the plane to try and spend as much time with King Charles so that they can build bridges, and enjoy each other&apos;s company like before.&quot; The source further emphasized Harry&apos;s determination to make the most of his time with his family during his visit, stating, &quot;He wants the family to get back to the way they were and is going to be making extra effort with his brother Wills too, as difficult as it may be. Now, more than ever, with Kate&apos;s cancer diagnosis too, Harry wants them to know he is there for them.&quot; Prince Harry talks seeing King Charles amid cancer battle Additionally, it was mentioned that Harry will be juggling his schedule around his charity work for the Invictus Games to ensure he can spend as much time as possible with his father. The source highlighted, &quot;Harry knows it will be awkward, but it&apos;s a time to put pride and differences to one side. He is coming over for his charity work, which is so important to him so he will juggle his schedule accordingly, but seeing his dad will come first.&quot; During his previous visit, Harry was granted a brief 30-minute audience with his father just before King Charles commenced his cancer treatment. Despite the limited time, Harry was said to be appreciative of the opportunity to see him.

    "title": "Samsung’s One UI 7: Beta Release Delayed for Galaxy S24 and S23, Launch Expected February",
    "text": "Samsung is currently behind its competitors in rolling out Android 15 updates. It has not yet released the first beta version of One UI 7 , in contrast to its previous rapid update timeline.\nRumors suggest that Samsung is focused on improvements to make One UI 7 the best version yet. A leaked timeline indicates that the beta for the Galaxy S24 series will start in the first week of December. The S23 series will receive the beta 2-3 weeks later. It is uncertain whether the Galaxy S22 series will get the beta this year, and the S21 series will not participate in the beta program.\nWhat are the main features and improvements expected in Samsung’s One UI 7 with ⁢the Android 15 update? Interview ‌with a⁢ Mobile ​Software Specialist on Samsung’s​ One UI 7 and ⁢Android 15 Updates\nInterviewer : Thank you for joining us⁢ today.‍ There’s been considerable talk about ‌Samsung being behind its⁤ competitors in rolling out Android‍ 15 updates. Can you provide some​ context on this delay and what might be contributing factors?\nSpecialist : Absolutely, it’s ‍an interesting topic. Samsung’s ​update strategy has been a strong suite⁢ of its brand⁢ identity. ⁢However, it seems like they are temporarily lagging, particularly ‌with the beta release of One ​UI 7. ⁤Traditionally,⁣ Samsung has been quick to ‍adopt⁣ the latest​ Android versions, but this time they appear focused on ensuring‌ that One UI 7​ brings significant improvements⁤ and⁤ refinements.\nInterviewer : There’s speculation that they want to ⁤make One UI 7 the best version yet. What could ‌these improvements entail?\nSpecialist : From what ⁤we’re hearing, Samsung might be enhancing⁤ user interface ​elements for better accessibility and responsiveness, integrating more advanced features, and‌ optimizing battery performance. They might ​also be placing a stronger emphasis on ‌security and privacy, which are‌ increasingly critical ‍features for users‍ today.\nInterviewer : A leaked timeline suggests that​ the beta for the Galaxy S24 series is⁢ expected ​to start in the first week of December. How does ⁤this timeline affect the rollout ⁤for earlier models like the S23 ⁢and S22?\nSpecialist : That’s ​correct. The Galaxy S24 series beta launch sets a crucial precedent.⁤ The ⁢S23 series following a few weeks later is ⁤typical,​ as those⁢ models are ⁣still relatively new. However, the uncertainty around whether the Galaxy S22 will get included this year suggests a shift in focus ​towards newer⁣ models, which could disappoint some users of the S22 series. As for the ⁤S21 series, it‍ appears they⁤ will miss out on this ⁢beta‍ altogether, which might signal a transition towards prioritizing newer devices in their update⁣ strategy.\nInterviewer : Given this approach, when can users expect a stable⁣ release of One⁢ UI⁤ 7?\nSpecialist : If we follow the leaked ⁤timeline, a stable ⁤version should be‍ expected around February, following a typical beta testing period of about⁢ two‍ months.‌ They plan to launch One UI 7 on the ​Galaxy S25 series first, which emphasizes their intention ⁣to highlight their​ latest technology through new‍ devices.\nInterviewer : are ​users with previous Galaxy models to be concerned about their devices’⁤ update futures?\nSpecialist : It’s always hard to gauge precisely, but this strategy might point to a more segmented focus on newer devices. Users ⁢of older models may increasingly find themselves outside the immediate ⁣update cycle. However, Samsung⁢ often reassesses its strategies, so while current plans seem⁢ to ​favor the S24 and S25, there may⁤ still be avenues for older models to receive⁢ significant updates down the line.\nThe beta program is expected to last about two months, with a stable release anticipated in February. This release will occur after the launch of the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung has confirmed that One UI 7 will debut on the S25 family before being available on other devices.",

    "text": "Apple Bear Holds ‘Muted’ View On December Quarter Amid Regulatory Headwinds, Lukewarm iPhone Sales: Retail Sentiment Sours Barclays sees increased pressure on the App Store regulatory front and ‘potential noise’’ around Apple’s China exposure, in terms of sales and supply chain, in the wake of the changing political backdrop.\nStocktwits Inc First Published Jan 10, 2025, 11:01 AM IST | Last Updated Jan 10, 2025, 11:01 AM IST Follow Apple, Inc. ($AAPL) is scheduled to report its fiscal year first quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, Jan. 30, and an analyst said he expects a mixed performance from the tech giant.\nBarclays analysts maintained an ‘Underweight’ rating and $184 price target for Apple stock, suggesting nearly 25% downside from current levels.\nThe stock had a strong run in 2024, rallying 31% in 2024 versus S&P 500’s 23% gain. It hit an all-time high of $260.10 on Dec. 24.\nCommenting on the 2024 stock move, the analysts said much of the performance was driven by multiple expansion despite a weaker-than-expected iPhone and increased regulatory risks.\nApple’s App Store business has been under pressure from regulators and developers in recent years. Last year, the company was forced to revamp its operations to conform with new European Union (EU) laws.
