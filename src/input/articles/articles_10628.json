    "text": "Gwen Stefani promoted her upcoming New Year’s Eve show in Las Vegas by sharing a post on her X account on Thursday. The 54-year-old hitmaker appeared to be particularly enthusiastic about her performance, which is set to take place at the Wynn Las Vegas. The No Doubt frontwoman, who recently opened up about living with dyslexia, also told her fans that she was ‘so excited 2 ring in 2024 with u.’ The show will see the performer returning to Sin City, where she formerly hosted her Gwen Stefani – Just a Girl residency. The Spiderwebs singer’s run of shows was held at the Zappos Theater, now known as the Bakkt Theater, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Gwen Stefani promoted her upcoming New Year’s Eve show in Las Vegas by sharing a post on her X account on Thursday The songwriter kicked off her residency, which covered several eras of her career, with a performance on June 27, 2018. Stefani’s run of shows continued intermittently over the course of the next three years, and it was temporarily put on hold due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Grammy Award-winning songwriter’s residency eventually continued in October of 2021 following the lifting of several coronavirus-related restrictions on public performances. The Sunday Morning singer continued for another month before she concluded her run of shows with a performance on November 6, 2021. Although she appeared to be excited about her upcoming concert, the hitmaker will not be joined by her husband of two years, Blake Shelton. The 47-year-old country artist, whom Stefani met while serving as a judge on The Voice, will spend the holiday in Tennessee, where he is set to perform during the New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash event. The singer spoke to Access Hollywood earlier this month and explained why she would be without her spouse on New Year’s Eve. ‘Well, it’s funny because I was going to be at his show, and then Vegas called and wanted me to be in Vegas,’ she said. The show will see the performer returning to Sin City, where she formerly hosted her Gwen Stefani – Just a Girl residency; she is seen in 2018 The songwriter kicked off her residency, which covered several eras of her career, with a performance on June 27, 2018; seen in 2018 Although she appeared to be excited about her upcoming concert, the hitmaker will not be joined by her husband of two years, Blake Shelton; seen in 2019 The 47-year-old country artist, whom Stefani met while serving as a judge on The Voice, will spend the holiday in Tennessee, where he is set to perform during the New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash event; they are seen in 2016 The performer, who played two New Year’s Eve shows at the Venetian Resort last year, stated that, although she was initially unsure about taking another gig in Sin City, she eventually came around to the idea. She recalled: ‘Last year I did Vegas and I was like, “Remind me to never do Vegas again.” [But] you sometimes want to… not be the host. So I was like, “Eh, I’m gonna do it.”‘ Stefani then expressed that, as her husband was going to be playing a show, she felt as if she should do the same and give it her all for her fans. ‘If you’re gonna be working then I’m gonna be working — so I’m just gonna fly in and out. It’s gonna be awesome. I’m really looking forward to it,’ she stated. *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12907719/Gwen-Stefani-says-excited-promotes-upcoming-New-Years-Eve-Wynn-Las-Vegas-two-years-wrapping-residency-Sin-City.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",
