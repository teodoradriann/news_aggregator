    "title": "‘Moral victory’: Bohol bishop writes to lawmakers who voted vs divorce",
    "text": "It was a loss at the House of Representatives, but still a victory for the Catholic Church in Bohol.\nAll three of Bohol’s lawmakers at the House – Edgar Chatto (1st District), Maria Vanessa Aumentado (2nd District), and Kristine Alexie Tutor (3rd District) – voted no to the divorce bill, which the lower chamber approved on third and final reading on Wednesday, May 22.\nThe House passed the bill with 131 yes votes, 109 no votes, and 20 abstentions.\nIn an open letter to the three Boholano lawmakers, Tagbilaran Bishop Alberto Uy thanked them for their “courageous stance” despite significant “societal and political pressures.” Their vote, he said, shows the importance of “standing by our beliefs, especially in challenging times.”\n“Although we may have lost this particular battle in Congress, the moral victory you have achieved is immeasurable. Your vote is not just a political act but a declaration of faith and conviction that resonates deeply within our community,” Uy said.\nThe Philippines is the only country in the world, aside from the Vatican, that prohibits divorce.\nThe Catholic Church opposes divorce because it believes it will make it easier to break up marriages to the detriment of children and society as a whole. Proponents of divorce, however, argue that it will also be children at the losing end if couples are forced to stick to failed marriages.\nDivorce is the next big test for the political influence of the Catholic Church in the Philippines – where Catholicism was the state religion under Spanish colonial rule, and where a former Manila archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, wielded huge influence on the country’s politics until his retirement in 2003 and death in 2005.\nWith weekly Mass attendance now down to 38% according to a 2023 survey, a mix of factors – including the rise of Evangelical churches, secularism, and political defeats through the years – have diminished the Catholic Church’s influence. It remains the most influential religious group in the country, however, and also the most vocal on human rights issues, including Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs .\nIn 2012, the Catholic Church already suffered a monumental defeat after then-president Benigno Aquino III – son of Corazon Aquino, a devout Catholic and former president supported by Sin – signed a controversial law widening access to contraceptives. The reproductive health law was approved despite pressure exerted by Catholic bishops through the years.\nIn 2022, the anointed presidential candidate of many Catholic priests, nuns, and lay leaders – Leni Robredo, also a devout Catholic – lost to Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of the dictator whom the Church helped oust in 1986.\nBohol, if we go by the votes of its three lawmakers, remains one of the strongholds of the Catholic Church in the Philippines. It is, after all, one of the 17 provinces with a Catholic population of at least 90%, according to the 2020 census of the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n“Your actions have not gone unnoticed,” the Tagbilaran bishop told the lawmakers, “and your legacy will inspire future generations to remain faithful and true.”\nAll politics is local, and perhaps all religion, too.\nWill the Church’s influence go beyond Catholic provinces like Bohol? Their final battle for divorce will be waged at the Senate, the chamber of 24 senators representing “24 republics.” – Rappler.com",

    "text": "25 000 Stars on GitHub\nTL;DR: We have recently reached 25 000 stars on GitHub. We would like to use this occasion to stop and reflect about DuckDB's recent year and our future plans.\nOur GitHub repository has just passed 25,000 stars. This is great news and since it is also the end of the year it is a good moment to reflect on DuckDB’s trajectory. There has been a lot of new and exciting adoption of DuckDB across the industry.\nWe would like to highlight two main events that have happened this year:\n- We\nreleased DuckDB 1.0.0. This version introduced a stable storage format which guaranteesbackwards compatibility and limited forward compatibility. - We started the\nDuckDB Community Extensions project. Community extensions allow developers to contribute packages to DuckDB and users to easily install these extensions using the simple commandINSTALL xyz FROM community\n.\nBesides the GitHub stars we have also observed a lot of growth in various metrics.\n- Each month, our website handles over 1.5 million unique visitors. In addition, we see over 300 TB in traffic from ca. 30 million extension downloads. Thanks again to Cloudflare for\nsponsoring the projectwith free content delivery services! - In one year, we rose in the\nDB Engines rankingfrom position 91 to 55 on the general board and from position 47 to 33 in therelational board, which makes DuckDB the fastest growing relational system in the top-50. - We count\n7.5M+ monthly downloads in PyPI. - Maven Central downloads for the JDBC driver have also shot up, we now see over 500k+ downloads per month.\nWe should note that we’re not glorifying those numbers and they are not a target per se for our much-beloved optimization in accordance with Goodhart’s law. Still, they are just motivating to see grow.\nAs an aside, we have recently opened a Bluesky account and are seeing great discussions happening over there. The account has already exceeded 4 thousand followers!\nFollowing our ancient two-year tradition, we hosted two DuckCon events, one in Amsterdam and another in Seattle. We also organized the first DuckDB Amsterdam Meetup.\nEarly next year, we are going to host DuckCon in Amsterdam, which is going to be the first event that we live stream in order to be more accessible to the growing DuckDB users in, e.g., Asia.\nBut for now, let’s sit around the syntax tree and be merry thinking about what’s to come.",
