    "text": "Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Friday said it is a matter of great pride for every devotee of Lord Ram that due to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the dream of a majestic Ram temple in Ayodhya will become a reality next month. Talking to reporters here, he also attacked the opposition parties, saying those who opened fire on the devotees of Lord Ram could neither build a temple nor abolish Article 370 of the Constitution and the practice of instant triple talaq. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Article 370 accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir. \"Due to the determination of Prime Minister Modi, Ram temple in Ayodhya could be constructed and it is a matter of pride for every Ram Bhakt,\" Dhami said. The consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya will be held on January 22. To a question on the proposed 'Bharat Nyay Yatra\" of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, he said, \"People know the character of these people who had made every effort to foil the bid to build Ram temple.\"\nHe said that under the leadership of Modi, India is continuously moving ahead in terms of development and progress.

They are carefully sorting through debris as part of a sensitive process to find the bodies of those still missing.\nDuring the flood, the Guadalupe River overflowed its borders to cover areas usually not affected, carrying debris as it overturned trailers, submerged vehicles and left behind a long path of damage.\nCopyright 2025 KLTV.

    "text": "PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The water quality of the Seine River has shown significant improvement just three weeks ahead of the Paris Olympic Games, where the opening ceremony will take place along the renowned river.\nTest results published by the Paris mayor's office on Thursday indicated a substantial enhancement in water quality from June 24 to July 2. The levels of E. coli bacteria at an Olympic swimming spot in central Paris fell within acceptable limits for four consecutive days, thanks to the warm and sunny weather in the French capital.\nThis marked the first time the weekly report of the Seine's water quality showed such promising results. The river is set to host the swimming leg of the triathlon on July 30-31 and August 5, as well as open-water swimming on August 8-9.\n\"This positive development is a consequence of the return of sunshine and warmth, as well as the effects of the work done as part of the strategy to improve the quality of the Seine's waters,\" the mayor's office stated.\nAdditionally, the readings for enterococci bacteria - a second key measurement of water quality - also showed significant improvement, remaining within acceptable limits every day at the Alexandre III bridge.\nSports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera hailed the \"clear improvement in the water of the Seine's waters\" and expressed confidence that the improved readings \"enable us to envisage the competitions going ahead serenely.\"\nOver the past decade, French authorities have invested 1.4 billion euros (1.5 billion U.S. dollars) in efforts to clean up the river, including enhancing the Paris sewerage system and constructing new water treatment and storage facilities.\nThe Paris Olympic Games will take place from July 26 to August 11. ■",

    "title": "Black Caps and Bangladesh T20 abandoned as heavy rain hits Tauranga",
    "text": "Rain has seen the second T20 between the Black Caps and Bangladesh abandoned after just 11 overs of play. Despite a worrying forecast and gloomy skies, play had begun on time at Mount Maunganui's Bay Oval. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bowl, looking to build upon their excellent start with the ball in the first T20 on Wednesday. It appeared to be another shrewd decision, as Finn Allen chipped Shoriful Islam straight to cover in the second over to depart for just 2. But after Tim Seifert survived being hit in the helmet by a booming Daryl Mitchell drive that came straight at him at the non-striker's end, the Northern Districts opener found a new lease of life, racing to 43 off 22 before being deceived by a slower ball from Tanzim Hasan Sakib and holing out to mid off. The Bangladesh spinners then turned the screws to stifle Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips, before the players left the field when a shower swept across the ground. New Zealand were 72/2 from the 11 overs, with Mitchell not out on 18 and Phillips unbeaten on 9. While it briefly appeared hopeful that play would resume, the clouds rolled in and dumped unrelenting rain that ruined any chance of a result. Despite the game finishing without a result, Seifert was pleased to get some time in the middle. \"I think we did pretty well and got off to a good start. \"You’re not going to get off to a good start all the time, but it’s always nice to back it up the next game. It was unfortunate to get out at that stage but I wanted to keep putting pressure on them because I think we had them in a good position.\" The teams will return to the same ground on Sunday for the third and final T20 in the series. The Black Caps will need to win in order to draw the series. Bangladesh meanwhile will be hoping to secure their first ever series win on New Zealand shores, something that spinner Rishad Hossain said excited the team. \"It’s a great opportunity and looking forward to it. It’s a great atmosphere playing against New Zealand in New Zealand. It’s not an easy job, I think the boys are doing well and we’re looking forward to the third game.\" Follow the summer of cricket [with TVNZ](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/sport/cricket) this summer.",
