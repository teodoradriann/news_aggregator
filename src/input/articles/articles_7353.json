    "text": "Ukraine Successfully Intercepts Attack Drones in Southern Regions\nIn a remarkable display of defensive capabilities, Ukraine’s military shot down three Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 drones during an overnight operation. This robust response by Ukraine’s Air Command South, in collaboration with other defense elements, underscores the effectiveness of Ukraine’s air defense strategies amidst the ongoing conflict.\nThe incident, occurring on the night bridging December 29 and December 30, involved the interception of two drones in the Kherson region, while the third was brought down over the Mykolaiv region. The proactive aggression by Ukraine’s southern defense system not only neutralizes immediate threats but also solidifies the nation’s resolve in preserving its airspace sovereignty amidst ongoing adversities.\nThis successful operation follows reports of significant losses inflicted on Russian forces, highlighting the intensity of the clashes in the region. As the conflict persists, Ukraine’s fortification of its air defenses becomes increasingly pivotal, with the support of allied nations contributing to the arsenal that thwarts adversarial advances.\nUkraine’s military tact and precision, as evidenced in these latest engagements, play a pivotal role in shaping the course of the confrontation, bolstering morale, and demonstrating resilience against hostile aerial incursions.\nFAQ Section:\nWhat are Shahed-136/131 drones?\nShahed-136/131 drones, made by Iran, are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used in military operations, known for their ability to carry out strikes on targets.\nWhat happened during the recent incident involving these drones?\nUkraine’s military successfully shot down three Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 drones. Two drones were intercepted in the Kherson region and one in the Mykolaiv region during an overnight operation.\nHow does this event demonstrate Ukraine’s defensive capabilities?\nThe successful interception of the drones highlights the effectiveness and robustness of Ukraine’s air defense strategies, as well as the coordinated efforts of Ukraine’s Air Command South and other defense elements.\nWhat is the significance of Ukraine enhancing its air defenses?\nAs the conflict continues, Ukraine’s fortification of its air defenses is crucial to protecting its airspace sovereignty and countering adversarial advances. The support from allied nations is also a significant factor in strengthening these defenses.\nHow does the destruction of the drones impact the larger conflict?\nThe shooting down of drones serves multiple purposes: it prevents immediate threats, boosts the morale of Ukraine’s forces, and reaffirms the nation’s resolve in defending its airspace, thus shaping the course of the ongoing military confrontation.\nRelated Definitions:\nAirspace Sovereignty:\nThe right of a sovereign state to govern the use of its airspace and to protect it against unlawful incursions.\nAir Defense Strategy:\nA military strategy involving the use of systems, tactics, and procedures to detect, track, and neutralize enemy aircraft or missiles entering a country’s airspace.\nProactive Aggression:\nThis term refers to preemptive or anticipatory actions taken by military forces to neutralize potential threats before they can inflict damage.\nRelated Links:\nHere are some related main domains where you can find more information on similar topics:\n–\nUkraine Ministry of Defense\n–\nUK Ministry of Defence\n–\nU.S. Department of Defense\nNote:\nPlease ensure that the URLs provided are valid and directly related to the topic before visiting.\n(Note for clarification: The content for ‘Related Links’ has been provided under the assumption that the URLs are correct.

    "text": "Genetic study reveals how extreme heat can accelerate ageing in older adults\nMPost28 Feb 2025 12:27 AM IST\nMPost28 Feb 2025 12:27 AM IST\nNew Delhi: A genetic study has shown how exposure to extreme heat can alter the way genes express themselves, and potentially accelerate ageing among older adults.\nExtreme heat has been linked to negative health outcomes, including heart disease and increased mortality. However, its impact on biological ageing remains unclear, researchers at the University of Southern California, US, said.\nPeople living in neighbourhoods experiencing more days of high heat show greater biological ageing on an average than residents of cooler regions, senior author Jennifer Ailshire, a professor of gerontology and sociology at the University of Southern California, said.\n“It’s really about the combination of heat and humidity, particularly for older adults, because older adults don’t sweat the same way. We start to lose our ability to have the skin-cooling effect that comes from that evaporation of sweat,” she explained.\nBiological age reflects the body’s functioning at the molecular, cellular, and organ levels. A higher biological age relative to chronological age (based on birth date) is considered a risk factor for various health conditions.\nThe study, published in the journal Science Advances, analysed blood samples from more than 3,600 adults aged 56 and above, over a six-year study period from 2010 to 2016.\nThe team analysed the samples for the way genes are turned ‘on’ or ‘off’ by a common epigenetic process called DNA methylation. An epigenetic process is how information stored in a gene gets translated into observable behaviour.\nPatterns in DNA methylation helped the researchers estimate the participants’ biological ages at each time point, changes in which were compared with their location’s history of heat index and heat days, as reported by the US’ National Weather Service.\n“Participants living in areas where heat days, as defined as ‘Extreme Caution’ or higher levels (over 32 degrees Celsius), occur half the year, such as Phoenix (in the state of) Arizona, experienced up to 14 months of additional biological ageing compared to those living in areas with fewer than 10 heat days per year,” co-author Eunyoung Choi, a postdoctoral scholar at the university said.\nThe link between extreme heat exposure and accelerated ageing remained significant regardless of socioeconomic and demographic differences, as well as lifestyle factors like physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking, the researchers said.\n“Just because you live in an area with more heat days, you’re aging faster biologically,” Choi said.\nThe authors wrote, “We demonstrated that short, mid, and long-term ambient outdoor heat can significantly accelerate epigenetic aging within a diverse, nationally representative cohort of older adults.”",

    "title": "¿Qué pasa si renuncia o muere el papa Francisco?",
    "text": "Hoy sábado el papa Francisco presentó una crisis asmática y requirió una transfusión de sangre que despertó temores de quedar vacante el trono de San Pedro.\n¿Qué pasaría si el Papa renuncia?\nLos documentos oficiales de la Iglesia católica en vigor solo hablan de “renuncia” y no usan otros términos como “dimisión” o “abdicación”.\nEl derecho canónico no prevé ningún individuo en particular, entidad, o personas a las que el Papa deba manifestar su renuncia. Sin embargo, algunos especialistas (especialmente el canonista del siglo XVIII Ferraris Lucius) sostienen que el colegio de cardenales, o al menos su decano, debe ser informado, ya que los cardenales deben estar absolutamente seguros de que el Papa ha renunciado a la dignidad válidamente antes de que se proceda a elegir a un sucesor mediante un cónclave.\nEsto aconteció con la renuncia del papa Benedicto XVI el 28 de febrero de 2013 a las 20:00 horas. Fue el primer papa en renunciar voluntariamente desde 1294.\nEl eventual cónclave se compone los cardenales electores de todo el mundo. menores de 80 años, quienes se encierran bajo llave en la Capilla Sixtina para debatir y realizar las votaciones para elegir al nuevo Papa, que tiene que ser votado por una mayoría de al menos dos tercios.\nDurante los días que dura el debate, los cardenales no tienen ningún tipo de contacto con el mundo exterior a través de medios de comunicación o teléfonos móviles.\nCuando el cónclave finalmente alcanza una decisión y el candidato acepte el nombramiento, una fumata de humo blanco sale por la chimenea de la Capilla Sixtina. Hasta entonces, al finalizar cada jornada sin un veredicto claro, la fumata es de humo negro.\nEn caso de fallecimiento\nEn 2024, Francisco simplificó los ritos que se desarrollan en los funerales de los Papas. Antes, el ritual tenía tres ataúdes, el primero de ciprés, el segundo de plomo, y el tercero de roble; todos tienen un significado tanto simbólico como práctico para preservar el cuerpo del fallecido. Ahora, solo se usa un ataúd de madera con un revestimiento interior de zinc.\nOtro cambio es que el cuerpo será depositado de inmediato en el ataúd y luego expuesto para la veneración de los fieles con el féretro abierto. Además, no se llevará a cabo el traslado al Palacio Apostólico. Por ende, el féretro debe ser trasladado directamente a la Basílica de San Pedro.\nPor último, el báculo papal no será colocado junto al ataúd. Se introdujo, además, el Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis, rito de los novendiales, el cual no tendrá solo tres formularios de oraciones sino cuatro.\nPosteriormente, se llevará a cabo el mencionado cónclave, concluyendo con la elección de un nuevo Papa.\nDe todos, el propio Francisco explicó que ya había firmado una carta de renuncia al inicio de su pontificado, como hizo Pablo VI”, afirmó, antes de calificar de “notable que sus condiciones hayan sido explicadas con claridad”, con “indicaciones muy precisas”.",

    "text": "MELBOURNE: A fired-up Pat Cummins bagged five wickets and 10 in the match to earn Australia a nail-biting 79-run win in the second Test and clinch the series against a battling Pakistan Friday.\nSet 317 for victory, the visitors put up a stellar fight as they chased their first Test triumph in Australia since 1995.\nBut they were dismissed for 237, with the last five wickets falling for 18 runs.\nCummins was the chief destroyer, taking 5-49 to go with his first innings 5-48 — only the second 10-wicket haul of his Test career.\nMitchell Starc chipped in with 4-55 as the tail collapsed after Shan Masood (60), Agha Salman (50) and Babar Azam (41) gave them a fighting chance.\nIt was always going to be a tough task, with the highest-ever successful fourth innings run chase at the Melbourne Cricket Ground the 332-7 England managed in 1928, with no other team getting past 300.\nOpener Abdullah Shafique departed for four during a tricky session before lunch, caught by Usman Khawaja in the slips off Starc following a period of intense pressure.\nIman-ul-Haq survived the initial blitz, but was no match after the break for Cummins, who sent down a probing ball that nipped back and trapped him lbw for 12.\nMasood was given out lbw by the umpire on 12, but it was overturned on review and he quickly got back in his stride.\nHe took a nasty ball to the ribs that needed treatment, but was undeterred and raced to a gutsy 50 before Cummins again came to Australia’s rescue, enticing an edge to Steve Smith.\nThere was plenty resting on the shoulders of Azam as the side’s premier batter and he looked in good nick.\nBut after reaching 41, Josh Hazlewood got a ball to jag back and it clattered into his off stump.\nMohammad Rizwan also looked dangerous on his way to 35 before Cummins again worked his magic, with Alex Carey collecting a catch behind the stumps after the ball went off the batsman’s glove.\nCummins then removed Aamer Jamal and Shaheen Shah Afridi in quick succession before Starc cleaned up.\nThe Pakistanis padded up after the hosts were all out in their second innings for 262, after resuming on 187-6.\nMir Hamza was the best of the bowlers with 4-32, while Afridi took 4-76.\nCarey slammed 53 to help Australia build their overnight lead and quieten chatter about his form after losing his place in the one-day side to Josh Inglis.\nHe resumed on 16 after Australia had bounced back from 16-4 thanks to an attacking 96 from Mitchell Marsh and Smith’s gutsy 50.\nCarey, who made his first and only Test hundred in Melbourne a year ago, hit consecutive fours in his first over from Hasan Ali to build confidence.\nAt the other end, Starc lived dangerously and fell for nine with the impressive Afridi getting the breakthrough on a pitch still offering a bit for the bowlers.\nAzam took the sharp chance at slip after Starc miscued a drive.\nCummins made a breezy 16 but was caught behind by Rizwan off Jamal, while Lyon crunched two straight fours off Jamal, then was bowled for 11 three deliveries later.\nCarey brought up his sixth Test half-century before being the last man out, lbw to Hamza.",

    "text": "News Link •\n[Energy](/Subjects/00092-LAST-energy.htm)\n• https://newatlas.com, By C.C. Weiss\nYamaha's world-first hydrogen outboard unveiled on prototype boat\nYamaha calls its new hydrogen V8 outboard a world first for the recreational boating industry and has partnered up with Roush and Regulator Marine to install it into a working boat that will begin testing in a few months.\nIn developing its hydrogen outboard prototype, Yamaha adapted the technology it has used for\nland-based hydrogen combustion engines, including the one it installed on the Drive H2 golf cart concept revealed last month at the PGA Show. In this case, it created a hydrogen version of its flagship XTO outboard, an offshore V8 offering 425- and 450-hp ratings, the most powerful in Yamaha's outboard lineup. Yamaha has not released output specs for the hydrogen version, so we're not sure how close it comes to joining the gas XTO at the top of the Yamaha outboard family.\nBuilding a combustion engine that can run on hydrogen is but one part of the equation; another major challenge is figuring out how to store and run the H2 to fuel it. For this aspect of the project, Yamaha turned to the experts at Roush for help.\nThe Roush name rings familiar to us primarily from its performance automotive division and Ford Mustang models and components, but the greater company includes engineering and clean tech arms that work in a wide variety of industries, from mobility and aerospace, to energy and defense. It has\ndecades of experience working with hydrogen power systems across various sectors.\n\"When you look at Roush's history with hydrogen, it ranges from land speed record vehicles to spacecraft,\" explains Matt Van Benschoten, vice president of advanced engineering at Roush. \"A lot of that knowledge we've acquired over the years, we are now applying directly to this Yamaha project. We are the fuel systems integrator, responsible for fuel systems designs, all of the specifications development, physical integration, safety system analysis, as well as testing and development. Yamaha is trying to determine if hydrogen can successfully be used in this market, and I think we will find out the answer is 'yes.'\"",

    "text": "NASA has probed 200+ potential instances of devices brought abroad without authorization In the past three years, NASA has investigated more than 200 reports of either space agency devices or systems being accessed outside the country without prior authorization, which would violate internal policy regarding where mobile technology units may be brought abroad. The reports of unauthorized foreign access investigations, obtained by FedScoop through a public records request, occur when a NASA device is detected overseas without a clear prior record of a planned trip. These reports are similar to databases that FedScoop has obtained from other agencies, including [the Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://fedscoop.com/fema-employees-brought-government-devices-abroad-without-authorization-including-to-china-and-iraq-document-shows/) and [the U.S. Agency for International Development](https://fedscoop.com/more-than-1300-devices-have-been-reported-missing-to-usaid-document-shows/) — and reflect the government’s longstanding approach to restrict the use of its devices abroad. The documents do not show the results of the investigations or which countries the pings were from. These reports appear to occur for several reasons, including: a device was pinged or geolocated on non-U.S. cellular networks, a device not cleared for travel was pinged abroad, or a device had connected to a NASA system from outside the country. The documents were obtained through a public records request for reports about lost or internationally carried devices from the past three years, as well as for other information explaining rules for mobile device security abroad. NASA’s Security Operations Center (SOC) monitors connections made to networks run by the space agency. Connections made abroad are flagged to the SOC, which then investigates whether the employee linked to that device was on authorized travel, according to Jennifer Dooren, a deputy news director at the space agency. She said that when a device doesn’t have prior authorization, “that device is restricted from accessing NASA’s networks and systems.” Her statement continued: “After review and approval, NASA employees are authorized to take government IT devices abroad on official government travel. Some NASA users may be required to perform authorized federal government work on NASA IT within designated countries. Users must follow all IT devices and travel requirements. For security purposes, it’s not appropriate for NASA to disclose details on NASA device configurations or potential individual security incidents.” The agency did not address FedScoop’s questions about the extent to which NASA employees are currently traveling to Russia, or whether Russia — or any other designated country of concern — has ever taken possession of a NASA device. There are risks with taking government devices abroad, said Sean Costigan, the managing director of resilience strategy at the software company Red Sift. The reports of devices brought abroad without authorization emphasize the importance of policies and protocols designed to protect government devices before government workers travel. China and Russia, he said, maintain “aggressive intelligence collection efforts that pose a heightened risk when government-furnished property is mishandled abroad.” Greg Falco, a Cornell engineering professor focused on cybersecurity and aerospace, said the number of devices reported seemed to be “inordinate,” though he said the issue was likely due to poor communication or, potentially, a cumbersome loaner device policy. “The risks are largely relating to eavesdropping or theft, where foreign entities may target data or software on a machine of interest and monitor activity,” he said. Documents also show that NASA issued an interim directive at the end of last year governing travel with government devices, along with other related rules. According to the policy, which represents the agency’s most-current version of rules on bringing devices abroad, space agency users can bring government devices to all countries, provided they meet certain technical and specific requirements and have approval, except for Russia and states on the agency’s [Designated Countries List](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/designated-country-list-4.21.2023.pdf). Those countries include Taiwan, which the U.S. does not [officially](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-taiwan/) have diplomatic relations with, as well as Israel, which is listed as having “missile technology concern,” based on the [ Commerce Department’s methodology](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-740/appendix-Supplement%20No.%201%20to%20Part%20740). Other countries on the list include North Korea, Iran, and China. NASA employees are supposed to use specially configured loaner devices when visiting these countries. “Operating outside the U.S. increases these risks, mainly where telecommunication networks are owned or controlled by the host government. IT devices are always at risk for introducing malicious software, and such risks are greater when devices leave the user’s physical control,” the policy states. These risks are greatest when traveling to the Russian Federation or countries on the Designated Countries List, it adds. The document also spells out what to do in the scenario that a device is confiscated by a foreign government or by U.S. authorities, including the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection. NASA employees are supposed to attempt to use their credentials to retain control of the device; if they’re asked for access codes to use the devices, they’re supposed to attempt to enter the device manually before giving out a password. The interim directive, which will remain in effect until December and will be replaced by another policy, comes amid growing concerns about the cybersecurity of the space industry. Last August, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence [released a brief warning](https://fedscoop.com/foreign-intelligence-warning-to-space-industry-highlights-risks/) that “foreign intelligence entities” could be targeting the commercial space industry and trying to steal technology assets. Namrata Goswami, an independent space policy expert, said “the consequence of any malicious foreign cyber actor getting access to a NASA network could mean them lurking in the network without discovery, getting access to export control technologies, and sniffing out encrypted passwords. This could have long-term strategic consequences for the United States specifically related to space technologies, which might have dual-use civil-military applicability for adversary nations to use against the U.S.” Costigan, the Red Sift cyber expert, said that given the space industry’s emerging technologies and strategic significance, the sector is “a prime target for espionage activities aimed at acquiring intellectual property and national security advantage.” “NASA devices used abroad, and their transmission of data across foreign networks, would make especially attractive targets,” he added.",
