    "text": "Texans heat index: Houston’s loss to Browns moves Cardinals’ 1st-rounder up Dec 28, 2023, 2:09 PM (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images) The 2024 NFL Draft is that much closer for the Arizona Cardinals following a Week 16 loss to the Chicago Bears. And boy is April’s draft an important one for general manager Monti Ossenfort and the Cardinals. In addition to their own first-round pick nestled between the Carolina Panthers and Washington Commanders at No. 2 overall, the Cardinals possess the Houston Texans’ first-rounder thanks to a 2023 draft-day trade orchestrated by Ossenfort. The prospects of landing not one but two picks inside the top 10 instantly entered the minds of many soon after the deal was made official. But much to the chagrin of Cardinals fans, the Texans have exceeded expectations under first-year head DeMeco Ryans and rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud so much so that Houston is in the conversation of teams still in the hunt for a playoff spot. Just getting anywhere inside the top 15 would be a big win for the Cardinals at this point. In an effort to keep track of Houston’s positioning in the draft order, here’s a look at where the Arizona’s other first-round pick sits heading into Week 17’s slate of games with a little help from [Tankathon](https://www.tankathon.com/nfl): 2024 NFL Draft snapshot 10. Atlanta Falcons (7-8) 11. New Orleans Saints (7-8) 12. Green Bay Packers (7-8) 13. Las Vegas Raiders (7-8) 14. Denver Broncos (7-8) 15. Minnesota Vikings (7-8) 16. Houston Texans *owned by the Cardinals* (8-7) 17. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-7) 18. Cincinnati Bengals (8-7) Arizona’s second first-round pick moved up one spot to No. 16 last week thanks to a Texans’ loss to the Cleveland Browns and the Steelers’ unlikely win over the Bengals. Joe Flacco did what now?! The Stroud-less Houston squad was unable to manufacture the same success it had in a Week 15 win over the Tennessee Titans, falling 36-22 at home to the Browns. A big reason for the Texans’ downfall on Sunday was off-the-couch gunslinger Joe Flacco’s third straight game of at least 311 yards and multiple touchdowns. The other factor was the otherworldly performance from wide receiver Amari Cooper, who ripped off 265 yards and two scores on 11 catches in Cleveland’s W. Texans heat index: Temperature rising How on earth is the Texans’ heat index on the rise after that kind of showing? He goes by Stroud. With the rookie expected to make his return to the offense this week after dealing with a concussion the past two games — Stroud’s back practicing and talked with reporters on Thursday signaling he’s out of the protocol — Houston should be riding high when the 5-10 Titans come to town. Before going down with the concussion, Stroud was among the handful of names in the MVP conversation behind 3,631 yards and 20 touchdowns to five interceptions on 62.4% passing. He’s turned heads in Year 1 and undoubtedly accelerated Houston’s rebuild timeline in the process. Stroud will also get his first look at divisional foe Tennessee Titans, who watched Case Keenum throw for 229 yards and one touchdown to an interception in Houston’s Week 15 win in overtime. Putting the Wild in Wild Card Another thing to watch for when it comes to Houston’s potential playoff bid — and slide down the draft order — is how the Bengals and Steelers fare the rest of the way and the Wild Card implications surrounding them. Currently, the Texans hold the head-to-head tiebreakers over the pair. If it just so happens that there’s one Wild Card spot left to grab between the three, the Texans would slot in. That’s multiple spots down the draft board if that’s the case. Crowded at the top of the AFC South There’s also the chance that the Texans don’t need a Wild Card spot to make the playoffs given the downturn from the division-leading Jacksonville Jaguars and just how close the AFC South is with three teams at 8-7. The Jaguars remain in the driver seat to win the division, currently holding tiebreakers over the Texans and Indianapolis Colts but are riding a four-game losing streak with a less-than-100% Trevor Lawrence under center. Again, a playoff spot for Houston is not a good thing for the Cardinals’ draft positioning. The Jaguars winning out the next two weeks, takes out one postseason scenario for the Texans. Lucky 7s? There are currently six seven-win teams sitting ahead of the Texans, three of which they can surpass in Week 17. In a perfect scenario, the Cardinals’ second first-round pick could go as high as 13th with a Texans loss and wins by the Raiders, Broncos and either the Vikings or Packers, who play one another in Week 17. NFL games to watch in Week 17 Outside of Texans-Titans, there are plenty of games to keep an eye on this week: Atlanta Falcons @ Chicago Bears This one could go either way with both coming off wins last week. Indianapolis Colts vs. Las Vegas Raiders The Raiders have found a groove under interim head coach Antonio Pierce, especially on the defensive end. The Colts meanwhile have won five of their last seven. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Carolina Panthers Like I mentioned before, a pair of wins by Jacksonville shuts at least one door to the playoffs for Houston. Even with their injury woes at QB, the Jaguars get a juicy matchup against the Panthers. Pittsburgh Steelers @ Seattle Seahawks A Steelers win keeps them behind the Texans in the draft order regardless of what Houston does. Denver Broncos vs. Los Angeles Chargers It’s a tough year in Chargers land. But Russell Wilson just got benched and the Broncos are riding a two-game losing streak. In no way is a Broncos win a forgone conclusion this week. Cincinnati Bengals @ Kansas City Chiefs A Bengals victory keeps Cincinnati behind Houston regardless of what the Texans do. And with what we’re seeing out of Kansas City, a win by the Joe Burrow-less Bengals isn’t out of the realm of possibility by any means. Green Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings One way or another, this game between two 7-8 squads is going to have an impact on the draft order.",

    "text": "Jasmine Pineda is experiencing some health issues amid her pregnancy .\nThe 90 Day Fiance star shared several photos on Thursday, implying that she and/or her baby are suffering from a health issue.\nThe Panamanian native uploaded two pictures and a video to her Instagram Story, all taken from inside an examination room, either in a doctor’s office, urgent care facility, or hospital.\nIn the first photo, Jasmine looked somewhat upbeat, making a peace sign with her hand and a kissy face with her mouth as she lay on an exam chair.\nJasmine was covered with white blankets, and her baby bump was connected to a fetal monitor.\nIn the second slide, Jasmine recorded the sound of her baby’s heartbeat playing on the machine hooked up to the fetal monitoring belt attached to her midsection.\nJasmine tells her fans she’s ‘not going home today’ after being seen by a medical professional Jasmine held what appeared to be either an intravenous hand button or a nurse call button in her left hand as she recorded herself.\nShe captioned the video, “Not feeling well today.”\nIn another slide, Jasmine moved from the exam chair to a regular chair, still covered in white blankets.\nJasmine’s facial expression was solemn as she stared straight ahead.\nThe expectant reality TV star wrote, “Well… we’re not going home today.”\nJasmine shared photos from inside an exam room while she was hooked up to pregnancy monitors. Pic credit: @jasminepanama/Instagram Jasmine’s post was ambiguous Jasmine’s Stories raise questions about her well-being and that of her unborn child.\nIt’s unclear if Jasmine was admitted to a hospital. Her statement that she wasn’t going home seems to indicate that she was being kept somewhere for further medical evaluation and treatment.\nJasmine didn’t provide any other details, leaving her 352,000 Instagram followers curious about her health and safety.\nWhether Jasmine is ill, her baby is suffering from a health crisis, or Jasmine is in labor remains to be seen.\nJasmine recently confirmed the pregnancy rumors that have surrounded her for months, but she didn’t share her due date, so no one knows how far along she is in her pregnancy.\nShe shared that her baby-to-be belongs to her boyfriend, Matt Branistareanu, and not her estranged husband, Gino Palazzolo.\nJasmine is dealing with a lot of responsibilities The contentious 90 Day Fiance personality certainly has a lot on her plate.\nIn addition to preparing to welcome her third child this year, Jasmine is undergoing a “very expensive and overwhelming” visa application process.\nAs Monsters and Critics reported, Jasmine told an Instagram follower she’s trying to bring her sons , Juance and JC, to the US to live with her.\nJasmine explained that if her boys’ visas are denied, she will return to Panama permanently.\nThis would create major hurdles in her already tangled love life.\nJasmine is now officially romantically linked to her baby daddy, a US resident, and hinted that Gino has joined their “polyamorous” relationship .\nMoving back to Panama with her two sons and a newborn would certainly make Jasmine’s personal life a lot more complicated than it already is.\nSeason 2 of 90 Day: The Last Resort airs on Mondays at 8/7c on TLC.",

    "text": "Mondaire Jones Gets What He Deserves After Jamaal Bowman Snub\nMondaire Jones was once a rising star in the Democratic Party. But with his latest antics over Jamaal Bowman, everyone is rightfully yanking their support.\nHouse Democratic candidate\nMondaire Jones has united pretty much everyone against him after his petty endorsement of Westchester County executive George Latimer over progressive Representative Jamaal Bowman. Latimer is largely considered to be running a Republican-backed campaign solely to oust Bowman, and Jones’s endorsement of his campaign has rankled several progressive groups.\nOn Thursday, Jews for Jamaal—a coalition of Jewish constituents in NY-16 and supported by local\nprogressive nonprofit Jews For Racial and Economic Justice— released a statement condemning Jones’s endorsement of Latimer and fiercely criticized Latimer’s prominently right wing-backed campaign.\n“As a diverse coalition of New York Jews, we reject continued use of Republican money to interfere with Democratic Party primaries with the aim of unseating a popular progressive Black Democrat,” the statement reads in part.\nAlso on Thursday, both New York’s Working Families Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC\nrescinded their endorsements of Jones. The Working Families Party, which revoked financial support for Jones’s campaign, issued a statement saying Jones’s endorsement of Latimer made clear he “strayed from the values and principles that made us proud to support him in 2020”:\n“Over the course of his campaign, Mondaire has strayed from the values and principles that made us proud to support him in 2020,” NYWFP codirectors Jasmine Gripper and Ana María Archila said in a statement to Gothamist. “His decision to back George Latimer, who uses\nracist dog whistles, rejects core parts of [President] Biden’s economic agenda, and shares donors with Mondaire’s own MAGA extremist opponent, runs counter to our values as a party.”\nJones, a former Bowman ally,\nendorsed Latimer on Tuesday, citing “Jewish residents in my district who feel anxiety, fear, and anger due to Representative Bowman’s words and actions in particular and an overall climate in this country.”\nBowman—a vocal critic of Israel’s deadly war on Gaza and Biden’s continued arms shipments to the country—has decried Latimer as a “Republican sock puppet” with his campaign’s significant support from\nMAGA conservatives, AIPAC, and pro-Israel opportunists hungry for the incumbent progressive’s ouster. Now, Jones’s endorsement of Latimer threaten his own race against aggressively pro-Israel Republican incumbent Representative Mike Lawler, who represents a Biden district that Jones could have recaptured in November.\nLatimer, meanwhile, has tried in vain to distance himself from the conservative groups supporting him. He has attempted to tout a progressive stance that largely focuses on casting Bowman’s Squad-backed progressivism as too extreme—and recently released a bizarre campaign video where he apparently\ngreen-screened himself with supporters in the Bronx, which is not part of Westchester County.",

    "text": "Agregar cereal al biberón de un bebé puede hacer que tenga un rápido aumento de peso\nLos bebés alimentados con bebidas de lácteos con cereal tenían un 50% más de probabilidades de aumentar de peso rápidamente\nSin embargo, no está claro si eso contribuirá a la obesidad infantil posterior\nJUEVES, 19 de diciembre de 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Añadir cereal al biberón del bebé es un hábito que existe desde hace mucho tiempo para ayudar a introducir alimentos sólidos, al mismo tiempo que complementa la leche materna de la madre.\nSin embargo, esta práctica puede hacer que los bebés aumenten algunos kilos a una edad temprana, según un estudio reciente.\nLos bebés tenían alrededor de un 50 por ciento más de probabilidades de experimentar un aumento rápido de peso si se alimentaban con bebidas de cereales lácteos durante su primer año, según los resultados, que se publicaron en la edición del 18 de diciembre de la revista [Acta Paediatrica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apa.17515).\n\"Las bebidas de cereales lácteos se asociaron con un aumento de peso rápido temprano\", concluyó el equipo de investigación dirigido por [Annelie Lindholm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annelie-lindholm-09467413b/?originalSubdomain=se), profesora de la Facultad de Salud y Bienestar de la Universidad de Halmstad, en Suecia.\nSin embargo, las bebidas de cereales lácteos no necesariamente se tradujeron en obesidad infantil.\nLos resultados muestran que las bebidas de cereales lácteos por sí solas no se asociaron con un IMC más alto o una relación cintura-estatura más alta cuando un niño tenía 6 años.\nPero en general, el rápido aumento de peso temprano se asoció con la obesidad infantil, duplicando el riesgo de un niño de un IMC alto a los 6 años, mostraron los resultados.\nSe necesita más investigación para desentrañar los riesgos tanto de las bebidas de cereales lácteos como del rápido aumento de peso infantil, señalaron los investigadores.\n\"A pesar de las asociaciones transversales entre el aumento de peso rápido temprano y el consumo de bebidas de cereales lácteos, este estudio no pudo demostrar una asociación perjudicial a largo plazo entre las bebidas de cereales lácteos y la adiposidad más adelante en la infancia\", concluyeron los investigadores.\n\"El aumento de peso rápido temprano es un predictor independiente más fuerte de las trayectorias de peso en la niñez\", continuó el equipo. \"Sin embargo, se necesita más evidencia para determinar el impacto de patrones específicos de alimentación temprana en las trayectorias de peso a lo largo de la infancia\".\nLa Academia Estadounidense de Pediatría [recomienda no](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Cereal-in-a-Bottle-Solid-Food-Shortcuts-to-Avoid.aspx) agregar cereal al biberón de un bebé.\nLos bebés podrían atragantarse con la mezcla espesa o inhalarla hacia los pulmones, advierte la AAP. La práctica también podría aumentar el riesgo de desarrollar [alergias alimentarias](https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/allergies/food-allergies-2659969860.html) o proporcionar a los bebés más calorías de las que necesitan.\n\"Se cree que el sistema digestivo de un bebé no está bien preparado para procesar los cereales hasta aproximadamente los 6 meses de edad\", dice la AAP en su sitio web. \"Cuando tenga la edad suficiente para digerir el cereal, también debe estar listo para comerlo con una cuchara\".\nEl nuevo estudio se llevó a cabo en Suecia, donde más de la mitad de los bebés consumen bebidas de cereales lácteos, apuntaron los investigadores.\nEstos incluyen bebidas de cereales lácteos que se venden en los estantes de los supermercados, hechos de granos y leche descremada deshidratada que se mezcla con agua caliente antes de la alimentación con biberón.\nEn el estudio, los investigadores dieron seguimiento a la salud de más de 1,300 niños en el oeste de Suecia cuyas estadísticas físicas y hábitos alimenticios se anotaron en encuestas familiares de 2007 y 2008.\nEn 2013 y 2014 se recolectaron datos de seguimiento de más de 650 de los niños.\nAlrededor del 62 por ciento de los niños fueron alimentados con bebidas de cereales lácteos entre los 6 meses y 1 año, según muestran los resultados. Alrededor del 18% de los niños experimentaron un rápido aumento de peso durante la infancia.\nLos bebés que tuvieron un aumento de peso rápido tendían a ser los que se alimentaban con bebidas de cereales lácteos, mientras que la lactancia materna tendía a proteger contra ese aumento de peso, apuntaron los investigadores.\n\"La lactancia materna durante los primeros 4 meses se asoció significativamente negativamente con un aumento de peso rápido temprano\", concluyó el equipo de investigación.\nMás información\nLa Academia Estadounidense de Pediatría (American Academy of Pediatrics) ofrece más información sobre [cómo agregar cereales al biberón de un bebé](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Cereal-in-a-Bottle-Solid-Food-Shortcuts-to-Avoid.aspx).\nFUENTE: Acta Pediátrica, 18 de diciembre de 2024; Wiley, comunicado de prensa, 18 de diciembre de 2024\nLos padres primerizos deben hablar con su pediatra sobre si agregar cereal al biberón de su bebé.",

    "text": "A falta de una semana para la Asociación Uruguaya de Fútbol presente ante la Conmebol sus descargos tras la pelea entre sus futbolistas y los hinchas de Colombia en la Copa América, el abogado Gastón Tealdi remarcó que hay circunstancias que atenúan la responsabilidad de estos. (Le puede interesar: Presidente Ramón Jesurún suma otro problema tras ser detenido en Estados Unidos: congresista envió carta a la Fiscalía exigiendo una rendición de cuentas por escándalo) \"Uno no puede algunas actitudes justificarlas, eso es una realidad. Desde el punto de vista profesional, siempre entiendo que uno no puede tapar el sol con un dedo. Uno tiene que ir con la verdad, pero hubo circunstancias que de alguna forma atenúan las responsabilidades y creo que la estrategia de defensa viene justamente en ese sentido\", dijo a la Agencia EFE. El abogado de la Asociación Uruguaya de Fútbol, quien trabaja en la defensa junto a su colega argentino Ariel Reck, recordó el partido Uruguay-Colombia jugado en Estados Unidos y señaló que desde el comienzo de este se vivió una situación \"totalmente desagradable\". Apuntó que hubo falta de previsión en materia de seguridad y que el expendio de bebidas alcohólicas generó una \"exaltación especial\" de una parte de la parcialidad colombiana. En ese sentido, Tealdi indicó que la defensa se encuentra recabando todos los medios probatorios y que redactará un escrito de descargo con una defensa general y en el que se analizará cada situación en particular. (Lea también: Selección Colombia femenina tropezó en su debut en los Juegos Olímpicos y cayó contra Francia) \"Por un lado hay una defensa general, pero después hay una situación particularizada por capítulos en cada una de las situaciones. No es la misma la situación de todos los jugadores\", detalló el abogado, quien también trabaja en la defensa de la Asociación, de un dirigente y de Marcelo Bielsa. \"Hay que meterse en profundidad en cada una de ellas. Tenemos confianza de que vamos a tener buenos resultados\", enfatizó Tealdi, quien añadió: \"El objetivo es que no haya sanciones o que las sanciones sean lo mínimo posible\". Los jugadores uruguayos a los que se le abrió un expediente son once. El abogado remarcó que a todos se les imputó la participación en riña y algunos la participación en riña con ejercicio de violencia. En el marco de las semifinales de la Copa América, Uruguay cayó por 0-1 frente a Colombia en un encuentro disputado en la ciudad de Charlotte. Una vez finalizado el partido, varios jugadores de la selección uruguaya saltaron a la grada y mantuvieron una pelea con hinchas colombianos. Un día después del hecho, la Conmebol informó que decidió abrir un expediente \"para dilucidar la secuencia de hechos y las responsabilidades de los involucrados\". EFE",

El pronosticador del tiempo, Nelson Valdez, publicó en su cuenta de X (antes Twitter) el mapa comparativo de las temperaturas en México y en África, en cuyos desiertos se pronostican temperaturas incluso menores a las de la República Mexicana. En la imagen que compartió, se puede ver el pronóstico de hastsa 48 grados Centígrados en el norte del país. El presentador insistió en que este 9 de mayo se vivirá un \"infierno\" caluroso, luego de compartir la publicación de una persona que resaltaba que en Nuevo León alcanzaron, este 8 de mayo, los 40°C. De acuerdo con el pronóstico del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, en los próximos dos días se mantendrá la segunda onda de calor de la temporada sobre la República Mexicana, incluido el Valle de México, pronosticándose temperaturas superiores a 45 °C en zonas de Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo (norte), Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche y Yucatán. Se esperan temperaturas máximas de 40 a 45 °C en Sonora, Coahuila, Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Querétaro (norte), Puebla (norte y suroeste), Morelos y Quintana Roo. Mientras que para el Estado de México, se prevén temperaturas máximas de 35 a 40 °C, mientras que para Ciudad de México, el termómetro alcanzará hasta los 35°C. El viernes, se mantendrá la segunda onda de calor de la temporada sobre el territorio mexicano, pronosticándose temperaturas superiores a 40 °C en gran parte del país. A partir del sábado finalizará dicha onda de calor, debido al debilitamiento de la circulación anticiclónica en niveles medios de la atmósfera que la generó, así como a la presencia de un sistema frontal.",
