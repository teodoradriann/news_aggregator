    "text": "La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) ha activado los avisos amarillos (riesgo) por lluvia y tormentas para este sábado, 10 de mayo, ante lo que el Servicio de Emergencias 112 del Gobierno de Cantabria recomienda extremar la prudencia. La meteorología adversa se iniciará a las 13:00 horas y se extenderá hasta las 20:00 horas. En este periodo de tiempo se esperan acumulaciones de 15 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, tormentas y no se descarta granizo.\nAnte este episodio, el 112 recomienda retirar del exterior de las viviendas aquellos objetos que puedan ser arrastrados por el agua; revisar canalones y desagües; no estacionar vehículos en cauces secos ni a la orilla de ríos; circular, en la medida de lo posible, por carreteras principales y autopistas, y aumentar la prudencia al volante. En el caso de encontrarse en campo abierto al inicio de una tormenta, es necesario buscar un lugar en el que cobijarse, como un coche o un edificio, evitando permanecer al aire libre; y si se está lejos de un refugio adecuado, se insta a los ciudadanos a mantenerse alejado de masas de agua y de zonas altas, se deben de buscar lugares bajos o una depresiones del terreno y no tumbarse en el suelo.\nAdemás, nunca hay que refugiarse debajo de árboles, en particular si están aislados, y es conveniente alejarse de alambradas, verjas, vías del tren y otros objetos metálicos, al igual que de zonas ricas en mineral de hierro.\nEn casa se recomienda evitar corrientes de aire, ya que atraen los rayos, cerrando puertas y ventanas. Durante la tormenta se deben de evitar los baños y las duchas, ya que el agua es una buena conductora de la electricidad. Es conveniente, también, proteger los electrodomésticos desenchufando aquellos que se pueda, para evitar que sean dañados por una subida de tensión o que ocasionen descargas eléctricas.\nAdemás, se insta a la ciudadanía a que ante cualquier incidencia llame lo antes posible al 112 para procurar una rápida intervención. Además, a quienes tienen cuenta en redes sociales, se les anima a seguir los perfiles oficiales de entidades que facilitan información sobre emergencias, estado de las carreteras o meteorología.",

    "text": "The\nLas Vegas Raiders have seized the opportunity to add another young pass rusher into the fold this offseason.\nThe Raiders\n have signed Patriots restricted free agent linebacker Christian Elliss to an offer sheet, per the wire. New England has until Monday, March 24 to match per Tom Pelissero on X, formerly Twitter.\nThe 25-year-old made 16 appearances and five starts last season in New England, posting 80 tackles, five quarterback hits, five pass deflections, and one interception and forced fumble.\nIt'll be interesting to see what the Patriots' decision is on Elliss before the end of the week.\nRaiders bring a low-risk option to the defense\nElliss entered the NFL in the 2021 season as an undrafted free agent, before finding a roster spot on the Philadelphia Eagles, where he spent his first two-and-a-half campaigns before heading to Foxborough in the second half of 2023.\nHead coach Pete Carroll\naddressed the team's most pressing needs at the NFL Scouting Combine last month, per Rachel Gossen of Raiders.com.\n“We won four games last year, and we've got to be realistic with that. We've got a lot of really good young players, I think. We've got some good veteran players, and we've just got to add quality humans and competitors to this roster wherever we can. And to me that's the biggest thing is like some guys that will do the harder thing longer than the person across from them, and we'll be in a good spot.”\nThis addition comes with some much-needed upside for the Raiders defense as they kick the the offseason into high gear before the NFL Draft next month. It's clear that Patrick Graham views Elliss as someone who can carve out a role, and potentially become a defensive mainstay down the road, as the Raiders try to be smart with the salary cap.",

    "text": "(CNN) — Paul Whelan marked five years in Russian detention on Thursday – a grim milestone that the ex-US Marine hoped he would never see.\n“It’s surreal,” Whelan told CNN in a call from his remote Russian prison camp last week.\n“It’s unbelievable to me that I’ve been here five years, that we’ve had two governments that haven’t been able to get me out of here,” he said.\nIn the half-dozen phone conversations Whelan has had with CNN since, he has expressed both confidence that the US government is working to secure his release and immense frustration that those efforts have not yielded success.\n“I would ask President Biden to pull out the stops, cross the red lines, and do whatever needs to be done to get this case resolved and to get me home. If my life is not worth that effort, then I don’t know what is,” Whelan told CNN last week.\nIn recent phone calls, Whelan has voiced exasperation that the US claims his case is “a priority” but has not found a way to bring him home. He has on multiple occasions conveyed a sense of abandonment and concern he will be left behind again, citing the release of two other Americans from Russia in a prisoner swap last year.\n“I am wondering what they’re going to do next. If there’s no diplomatic solution, what comes next? What are they prepared to do to honor that promise to get me home? If they’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping that something sticks and they can come up with a quick agreement, that’s not a very good policy,” Whelan told CNN in late November.\nWhelan has also increasingly expressed fear for his safety, telling CNN last week that he was being targeted by an official at the prison camp after being assaulted by another prisoner.\n‘I would never have come here’ Whelan was arrested in Moscow on December 28, 2018, which he says he visited for a friend’s wedding, and imprisoned on charges of espionage that he has consistently and vehemently denied.\n“If I had known that there would be any sort of problem, I would never have come here,” Whelan said last week.\nHe was sentenced to 16 years in prison in June 2020. He has been serving that sentence at a remote prison camp in Mordovia, where he does manual labor at the prison’s clothing factory.\nWhelan was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department in May 2020.\nFor Whelan and his family, the anniversary of his arrest is an acute reminder of how much they have lost. But the painful fact that five years have gone by is never far from their minds.\n“This is five years of my life and I can’t get back, five years of my parents’ life that we can’t get back,” Whelan told CNN in October.\nWhelan’s parents are in their 80s, and he told CNN in May, “I know this is taking its toll on my parents and that’s the unfortunate thing.”\n“It’s a concern for me that I won’t see them again,” Whelan echoed in the call last week.\nThe family’s beloved dog, Flora, about whom Whelan spoke fondly during his May call with CNN, passed away the following month.\n“I never thought I would be here not to see my cat, not to see my dog and they both passed away. Relatives have passed away. Friends have moved on. I’m very concerned that I won’t get home to see my parents,” Whelan told CNN last week.\n“It’s been like running through a labyrinth and we’re still not out yet,” said Elizabeth Whelan, his sister. She told CNN in mid-December that the plight has also taken a large financial toll on the family.\nSuccess! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.\nError!
