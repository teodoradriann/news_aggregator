This Friday it will issue its resolution in the Official Gazette. Given this decision, the Santa Fe team, Like Arsenal, they are both relegated and they will play in the second category of Argentine soccer in 2024. On December 6, after losing 1 to 0 against Gimnasia, Colón made a presentation, through his lawyer, requesting the annulment of the relegation. «In mid-2023, the AFA Assembly decided to modify article 90 of the Statute and therefore the demotions, eliminating one of the relegations. This occurred with the season already underway. (…) This new system adopted once the season “was already underway, is openly illegitimate and violates the guarantees of legal and sporting equality.”the writing began. «A playoff match played on the basis of a regulation altered in the middle of the competition without the approval of all members of the Executive Committee cannot be admitted. The modifications of the June 2023 Assembly without the approval of all the members of the Committee, should in any case have been in force for the 2024 season,” completed the Sabalera entity headed at that time by José Vignatti. After two weeks of waiting, the disciplinary body decided to ratify the loss of category and will announce it in the next few hours.

    "text": "Giovedì migliaia di dipendenti di Boeing, la grande azienda statunitense che produce aerei civili e militari, hanno dichiarato uno sciopero, il primo dal 2008, dopo il mancato raggiungimento di un accordo con la dirigenza dell’azienda per la formulazione di un contratto collettivo quadriennale. L’International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), sindacato che rappresenta circa 33mila lavoratori di Boeing, ha proclamato lo sciopero dopo aver rifiutato un’offerta contrattuale fatta dall’azienda che non includeva una serie di benefici e tutele richieste dal sindacato, tra cui aumenti di stipendi, più sicurezza sul lavoro e il ripristino di una serie di benefici pensionistici persi negli ultimi anni.\nBoeing ha circa 150mila dipendenti, è una delle più grosse aziende manifatturiere statunitensi e la più grande per numero di esportazioni: lo sciopero dovrebbe causare l’interruzione delle operazioni di produzione nella zona di Seattle, nello stato di Washington, in cui si concentra la maggior parte della produzione di aerei commerciali Boeing. L’IAM ha fatto sapere che lo sciopero è stato approvato dal 96 per cento dei suoi membri, ben di più dei due terzi richiesti per avviare la protesta.\nTag: boeing - sciopero",
