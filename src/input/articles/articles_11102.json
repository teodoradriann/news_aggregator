    "text": "降三高攻略\n找醫師\n醫學百科\n專題\n韓團男星傳「白血病奪命」23歲英年早逝 醫：4症狀血癌徵兆\n韓國男團F.able成員沈宰賢不幸英年早逝的消息傳出，令許多粉絲感到震驚與不捨。這位年僅23歲的年輕歌手與白血病纏鬥許久，最終仍不敵病魔的摧殘，於6月30日離開人世。面對如此年輕就罹患急性血癌的案例，究竟可能的原因為何？又該如何及早察覺身體的異狀呢？\n沈宰賢死訊 粉絲才知他的病這麼嚴重\n2020年，沈宰賢曾隨F.able組團出道，推出多首膾炙人口的歌曲，包括〈Burn it up〉、〈Run Run Run〉和〈Cloud 9〉等，深受歌迷喜愛。F.able不僅在日韓兩地舉辦演唱會，也經常與粉絲互動，人氣頗高。然而，該團在前年8月宣布因成員長時間行程難以負荷，決定暫時休息。\n看更多：貧血未注意 譚敦慈弟罹患血癌骨髓移植救不回！醫：男性貧血不單純\n去年，部分團員另組新團ENPHAZE，沈宰賢則鮮少公開露面。直到死訊傳出，粉絲才驚覺他正因白血病接受治療。據悉，宰鉉在治療白血病的過程中曾一度好轉，6/30病情急轉直下病逝，許多粉絲紛紛湧入他的社群平台留言悼念，不捨年輕的生命就此凋零。\n急性血癌發作急又凶 死亡風險高\n烏日林新醫院血液腫瘤科主任林敬業表示，急性血癌的發作非常迅速且凶猛，嚴重程度和死亡風險本來就比其他類型的血癌來得高。以23歲的年輕人而言，通常好發的急性血癌類型與兒童有所不同。急性血癌可分為淋巴性和骨髓性兩大類，兒童多為淋巴性，成人則大多是骨髓性。\n雖然媒體並未明確指出沈宰賢罹患的血癌種類，但林敬業指出，相較於老年患者，年輕人的血癌治療效果通常較佳，這是因為他們的體力狀況普遍較好，醫師能夠選擇較為積極的治療方式，如骨髓移植或幹細胞移植等。透過強力化療加上骨髓移植，年輕患者的治癒率可提高至6至7成。\n然而，林敬業也提醒，淋巴性白血病的復發率較高，即使接受骨髓移植，仍有可能復發。此外，急性白血病除了本身快速惡化的致命風險外，因化療劑量強大，每次治療後都可能出現白血球數量大幅降低的情況，進而提高嚴重感染的風險。一旦感染情況太過嚴重，導致敗血症難以控制，就可能危及患者性命。\n化療過程充滿變數 骨髓移植存在風險\n對於急性白血病患者在化療過程中的死亡風險有多高這個問題，林敬業坦言並沒有明確的統計數據。他解釋，每次化療後，白血球數量勢必大幅降低，達到嗜中性白血球低下的程度。一旦出現感染，就存在死亡的風險，但確切的機率仍無法得知。\n林敬業進一步說明，年輕患者若選擇進行骨髓移植，雖然存活率較高，但同時也面臨更高的風險。因為在移植前，患者需接受高強度的化療，甚至還要加上放射線治療，這些都可能增加感染、死亡和排斥的風險。\n此外，即使患者順利度過移植過程，日後仍有復發的可能，進而導致病情惡化而死亡。\n及早察覺白血病徵兆 把握治療黃金期\n究竟白血病的發生原因為何？又有哪些常見的症狀呢？林敬業表示，除了過去曾接受化療或放射線治療外，其實並沒有太多明確的危險因子。像是廣島、長崎等地區在原子彈爆炸後，或是發生輻射外洩事件的地區，都可能增加民眾罹患血癌的風險。此外，骨髓分化不良或骨髓增生異常等骨髓方面的疾病，也有少數會轉變成血癌。至於一些民眾擔心的高壓電等環境因素，除非是在核能電廠內工作，否則並不會明顯增加罹癌風險。\n林敬業進一步指出，許多年輕患者的血癌發生原因並不明確，大多屬於偶發性，即使是嬰幼兒罹患，也很難找出明顯的危險因子。家族遺傳性的血癌案例其實並不常見。\n看更多：「捏捏樂」百萬網紅驚曝罹癌 療癒神器變致癌殺手？眼痛、咳嗽、免疫失調都上門\n出現4大症狀 應提高警覺盡早就醫\n林敬業提醒民眾，若出現以下4種症狀，應提高警覺，及早就醫檢查：\n- 骨髓功能受損：骨髓負責製造白血球、紅血球和血小板，功能受損會導致三種血球數量減少或不正常。白血病會出現不正常的白血球增加，但缺乏抵抗力，可能引起發燒。\n- 貧血：紅血球減少會出現貧血症狀，如體力下滑、臉色蒼白、走路爬樓梯喘等。\n- 出血：血小板減少可能導致無緣無故的出血，如流鼻血、牙齦出血、皮膚出現瘀青或瘀斑等。\n- 不明原因發燒：血癌細胞本身也可能引起發燒。\n雖然上述症狀並非血癌獨有，但若突然出現明顯異常，沒有其他原因可解釋，例如沒有碰撞卻身上出現很多瘀青、莫名流鼻血、牙齦流血等，就必須提高警覺，及早就醫釐清病因。只要把握早期黃金治療時機，年輕血癌患者仍有機會透過積極治療，提高存活率，擺脫病魔的糾纏。\n看更多：女童跌倒跛腳1月骨頭「被吃了」！每天不動20分鐘「這束光」助她正常跑跳\n◎ 圖片來源／news1提供\n◎ 諮詢專家／林敬業醫師\n女性45歲後小心甲狀腺癌！醫授3招自我檢查 「1健康零食」恐讓甲狀腺過勞2022-11-25 16:51:35\n最新10大抗癌食物！最強防癌是青花苗、高麗菜能抑制癌細胞 它還降膽固醇2025-04-07 11:53:00\n陳水扁切胃息肉！這種胃癌風險高 亞洲人多吃1物有效防胃癌2025-06-17 11:09:00\n羅家英罹2癌「放棄化療電療」最多再活8年 雙癌症會互相影響？2025-06-23 18:50:00\n揪出攝護腺癌！健保給付攝護腺健康指數 篩檢更精準2025-06-24 12:15:00\n長期胃食道逆流恐變食道癌！醫半年收3例 1症狀是前兆2025-07-02 15:10:00",

    "text": "MARTIN, TN-- Warming shelters across the Local 6 area are open in response to the blistering cold temperatures. The community coming together has inspired the volunteers. In below freezing temperatures like these, a safe place to warm up is something a lot of us take for granted. Unfortunately, it's something many go without. That's what inspired this community-led warming center in Martin, Tennessee. Joyce Washington is amazed at every donation from her community. “It's just really given me hope for my community that people really did come together,” Washington says. There are blankets and cots, food and water, and even free transportation from agencies like the Martin Police Department. Their community needs it all. “We're fooling ourselves if we think we don't have a population of unsheltered or shelter-sensitive people, because they exist out here,” says Washington. More than 30 volunteers signed up to work in the shelter or offered resources. Even after a day with no visitors in the warming center, Washington says it's still a success, because the community showed up to make it happen. “I'm okay that we didn't have anybody. That means that they found somewhere to go. But at least this community, this county, provided some option,” Washington says. With these cold temperatures sticking around, Washington says she doesn't know whether or not the shelter will open for the rest of the week. That all depends on weather conditions and whether volunteers will be available. The shelter will reopen for its last scheduled day Tuesday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. You can request a ride by calling 731-364-9226.",

    "title": "Mohammad Mustafa appointed Palestinian Prime Minister",
    "text": "Live updates: Follow the latest on Israel-Gaza Mohammad Mustafa, a technocrat who is seen as close to President Mahmoud Abbas , has been appointed the new prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, which governs the occupied West Bank. Mr Abbas, known widely as Abu Mazen, has been under pressure from the US and others to reform the Palestinian Authority so it can be involved in a postwar settlement that could lead to it administering Gaza, where Hamas has ruled since 2007. The resignation of Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh paved the way for a new government, with the appointment of Mr Mustafa on Thursday. However, Palestinian officials and experts say that Mr Mustafa is too close to Mr Abbas to signal genuine reform, and could instead represent an attempt by the aged President to cling on to power. “[Mr Mustafa] doesn't have his own constituency and he has been seen as being too close to Abu Mazen,” said Ghaith Al Omari, a former adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team. “So ultimately, what's going to happen is, Abu Mazen will try to maintain the key authorities with himself, which is security and finance.” British Foreign Secretary David Cameron shared his hope for lasting peace in the region with Mr Mustafa's appointment, saying on X: \\\"I welcome the appointment of Mohammad Mustafa as Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. \\\"The formation of a new Palestinian government for the West Bank and Gaza, accompanied by an international support package, is one of the vital elements for a lasting peace.\\\" Mr Mustafa has served as a senior economic adviser to Mr Abbas for almost two decades and is seen as a financial specialist. Born in 1954, Mr Mustafa received his education in Iraq and the US before a long career in finance and business. He has led the Palestine Investment Fund since 2009. The fund was established by the PA in 2003 to promote the growth of infrastructure, real estate and telecoms in the Palestinian territories. Mr Mustafa founded the Palestine Telecommunications Company (PalTel), alongside other businesses including Wataniya Mobile / Ooredoo Palestine. He was deputy prime minister from 2013 to 2014 and is an independent member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Executive Committee. Despite serving as deputy prime minister, Mr Mustafa is seen as having no close links to the main political factions in Palestinian politics: Fatah, the most important party in the PLO, or its rival Hamas, which is now the target of Israel's war on the enclave. Fatah's Central Committee reportedly favoured a member of its party over Mr Mustafa. Hamas is open to a national consensus government and is prepared to accept not having members of its group officially in the government to make it palatable to the international community, as long as it has a say in appointing key ministers. Mr Mustafa's lack of factional connections could work against him, as he lacks the political base of other figures such as the imprisoned Marwan Barghouti , who is widely seen as the most unifying candidate within the Palestinian territories, or Mohammed Dahlan, the former Fatah security commander living in exile. “He's not a known figure. He's maybe a known name but he's not a known figure. And he has no political agenda, he is a political independent. So he doesn't have a political base,” said Mr Al Omari. Mr Mustafa's lack of a political base and close relations with Mr Abbas mean his appointment has been seen as an attempt by the President to maintain power under the guise of reforms. “I think Abu Mazen appoints people who he feels comfortable with and he's looking for somebody who is going to be able to serve as prime minister who is not going to be a challenge or as precedent – it's as simple as that. And Mohammad Mustafa is that person,” said Diana Buttu, former legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team. “The donors and Israel have been pushing for the complete decimation of Palestinian political parties and Palestinian political movements. \\\"This is why all you've heard for all of these past few years is technocratic government, technocratic government, technocratic government. “What's behind the idea of a technocratic government it’s to not have a political movement. “What is the role? We don't know exactly, what we do know is that Abu Mazen is going to want to continue to hold on to all of those political matters and that he doesn't want to have any political leadership that is embodied on the ground.” Other experts have suggested the appointment is “performative” and part of Washington's plans for postwar Gaza and the West Bank. “I don’t think most people are under the impression that Abu Mazen is committed to genuine reforms and so he is going through the motions with this impending appointment,” said Mairav Zonszein, senior analyst on Israel at the International Crisis Group. “I think it’s part of the US effort to show that there is a restructured PA that can eventually take over the Gaza, but that is very very far away, and at this stage seems largely performative.” Ms Zonszein added that Mr Mustafa's appointment is unlikely to make a difference in Israeli attitudes towards working with the PA. “For those Israelis and the leadership who refuse to work with the PA, this probably will remain this way. And for those that think the PA is the only way to go, they will welcome the move,” she said. Mr Mustafa is seen as having close relationships with the world of global finance and has studied and lived in the US. One source described Mr Mustafa as “an expert with an international dimension and linked to the world of investment”. After receiving his bachelor's degree at the University of Baghdad, he attended George Washington University in the US capital, where he earned a doctorate. He has also served as a visiting professor at the American university, according to his LinkedIn profile. He held prominent positions within the World Bank for about 15 years, and has spoken at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a gathering of the global political and financial elite. Mr Mustafa has also worked in advisory roles for the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments. In Saudi Arabia, he served as an adviser to the Public Investment Fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds and a driving force behind the kingdom's domestic transformation.",

    "text": "A carne vermelha , amplamente reconhecida por ser uma fonte de proteínas, vitaminas e minerais, tem sido associada ao aumento do risco de câncer quando consumida em grandes quantidades.\nEstudo desvenda como carne vermelha pode estar ligada ao câncer - racorn/DepositPhotos Embora essa relação fosse previamente identificada por diversos estudos, o mecanismo biológico por trás dessa associação ainda não estava claro até o momento. Agora, cientistas de Singapura descobriram uma possível explicação para esse vínculo.\nDescobertas dos cientistas Os pesquisadores focaram no intestino e realizaram um estudo aprofundado sobre o câncer colorretal , que é frequentemente relacionado ao consumo excessivo de carne vermelha.\nPublicado na revista Cancer Discovery em 4 de outubro, o estudo mostrou que o ferro presente na carne vermelha pode ativar uma enzima chamada telomerase, através de uma proteína chamada pirina. Esse processo acelera o desenvolvimento de células cancerígenas.\nA telomerase tem a função de proteger o material genético, “remendando” os telômeros, que são as extremidades dos cromossomos. Esse processo permite que as células se dividam sem limitações, característica comum nas células cancerígenas.\nNos tecidos saudáveis, a atividade da telomerase é controlada, mas nas células tumorais, ela é reativada, permitindo a multiplicação das células cancerígenas de forma descontrolada.\nComo o ferro da carne vermelha contribui para isso? Os cientistas descobriram que o ferro da carne vermelha pode, em combinação com fatores genéticos, reativar a telomerase nas células do intestino, promovendo o crescimento de tumores malignos.\n“Mostramos como o ferro -(Fe3+) em conluio com fatores genéticos reativa a telomerase, fornecendo um mecanismo molecular para a associação entre sobrecarga de ferro e aumento da incidência de cânceres colorretais”, explicaram os autores do estudo.\nReduzir o consumo de carne pode reduzir o risco de câncer? Estudos observacionais indicam que reduzir o consumo de carne vermelha pode estar relacionado à diminuição do risco de desenvolver câncer, incluindo o colorretal.\nUm estudo de 2022 publicado na BMC Medicine apontou que pessoas que consumiam carne vermelha em menores quantidades apresentaram uma redução de 9% no risco de câncer colorretal em comparação com aquelas que comiam carne mais frequentemente.\nAlém disso, a pesquisa revelou que dietas vegetarianas e veganas estavam associadas a riscos ainda menores de cânceres como o de mama e próstata , sugerindo que a moderação no consumo de carne pode ser uma estratégia útil para a prevenção de doenças. No entanto, mais estudos são necessários para confirmar esses resultados.",

Below freezing to start November were places in the Four Corners region like Farmington and Durango, in the northern mountains like Santa Fe and Taos, and out west like Gallup and Grants. Temperatures stayed above freezing in many places in southern and eastern New Mexico, even into the 40s in places like T or C, Ruidoso, Clayton and Roswell – the Albuquerque metro as well. However, feels like temperatures in places like Albuquerque and Los Lunas were at around 31°. For the rest of Friday, southeastern New Mexico will be the focus. Isolated showers and severe flooding is possible, which is a concern given what happened two weekends ago. Meteorologist Kira Miner shares all the details in her full forecast in the video above.
