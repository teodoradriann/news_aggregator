    "text": "Furthering the goal of ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’: Deerfield Transfer Station adds swap shed |Published: 07-18-2024 4:23 PM| DEERFIELD — The old saying goes that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure, but what if there was no need to throw the item out in the first place? Beginning this past weekend, Deerfield residents using the Transfer Station now have a new outlet for getting rid of their items in the form of a swap shed, which allows folks to bring small appliances, home decor, dishware and other similar items in an effort to reuse those items rather than throw them out. “A lot of people know the old saying ‘reduce, reuse, recycle,” said Franklin County Solid Waste Management District Program Director Amy Donovan. “We’ve got the recycle part down, we’re learning how to reduce. I think we can do more about reuse and we are doing a good job with all those different reuse outlets, but we can do more.” The goal is simple: keep items out of the landfill, while also allowing residents to make use of a previously unwanted object. Donovan said this is the 11th swap shed within the Franklin County Solid Waste Management District — which has 21 member towns and 17 transfer stations. Other iterations, such as Conway’s, which is nicknamed “the Conway Mall,” have been hugely successful in the past, according to Donovan. “The other towns have had great luck with their swap sheds,” she said. While the objective and premise of Deerfield’s swap shed remains the same, there are a few additional regulations due to the size of the town compared to its counterparts in the district. The biggest difference is that Deerfield’s shed will be staffed by trained volunteers and, at least to start, will only be open on Saturday mornings from 9 to 11 a.m. These Saturday hours are extended to be from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. between April and October. While other sheds may allow items to be dropped off at all hours, Donovan said the Deerfield shed will only accept items when team members are working. Team members have the final say on what items are accepted. Article continues after... Yesterday's Most Read Articles “The other towns that have swap sheds in Franklin County are really small towns,” Donovan noted. “We wanted to avoid any issues that could arise with a larger population.” All items must be clean and in working condition. Examples of acceptable items include small appliances, artwork, home decor, household items, office supplies, small hand and power tools, and other similar items. Larger appliances, clothing, car seats, furniture, large safety items and computers, among other items, will not be accepted. To use the swap shed, residents must have a Deerfield Transfer Station sticker. The full list of regulations and more information can be found on the town website at [bit.ly/4bEQo5K](https://www.deerfieldma.us/DocumentCenter/View/2262/Deerfield-Transfer-Station-Swap-Shed-Policies). “We’re just getting started with it,” she said. “It’s not anything glamorous, it’s not a big shed, but it’s a good way to keep items in circulation.”Chris Larabee can be reached at clarabee@recorder.com.",

    "text": "Wedding ceremonies often signify the very beginning of a couple’s journey together as a singular union. From taking that big leap to planning everything out meticulously, it’s important to many duos that such a day goes off without a hitch. Yet, we can’t always predict the unexpected.\nA recent TikTok video displayed such an instance, where a newlywed couple, who conducted their wedding in Pasir Puteh, Kelantan, were met with some unfortunate interruptions in the form of rainfall and flooding.\nHowever, the clip, which was captured by a photographer for the wedding ceremony, named Ismail, showed just how united the couple’s families were despite the unplanned interferences. In the video shared to his page\n@jaismailji, the photographer managed to capture the spirit of the overall ambience.\nSmiling and full of cheer, the aunties, uncles, cousins, and beyond, carried on graciously with the ceremony as planned.\nWalking through the rainwater, multiple individuals helped see to the bride, who had to lift her wedding dress skirt to walk through the waters. One young lady can be seen assisting the bride by holding her left arm, while a man holds a giant umbrella to usher the bride closer to her husband.\nAfter reaching him, the groom himself also came forward through the flood water and posed for pictures with his bride. Beaming with joy, no rain could keep the family down, as others stood close by to help them if they needed anything.\nSpeaking to WORLD OF BUZZ, Ismail stated that when they arrived at the bride’s house to begin their photography duties, water levels had already started to rise. However, it further increased as time went on, even before the bride and her family had to walk to the groom’s home, which was nearby.\n“It was actually part of the visiting ceremony, where the bride had to go to the groom’s house. Although the water levels started to rise, the event itself went smoothly after,” said Ismail to WORLD OF BUZZ.\nA number of commenters expressed their confusion over the couple’s decision to carry out their wedding ceremony during monsoon season.\n“The East Coast always experiences heavy rainfall at the end of the year, so it will definitely flood as well. Next time, it’ll be better to not have weddings at the end of the year hahaha,” added one user.\nNevertheless, multiple people also stated that despite the unexpected rainfall, it must have been a heartwarming experience for the couple to have all their closest family members rally around them.\n“Must have been a sweet experience for the couple,” commented another user.\nWatch the full TikTok video below:\nMonsoon in Kelantan\nWhile things may not always go as planned, we’re happy to know that this couple had the unconditional support of their family to make this ceremony a true success.\nAlso read:\nThis M’sian Vet Posing With Her Oyen at Her Wedding is The Most Wholesome Thing You’ll See Today",

    "text": "Over the last three months, Kathleen Kimble and her husband Bill Fleischman, along with many of their Rose Park neighbors in Missoula, have received some distressing letters. In early November, the city of Missoula notified the retired couple they would owe $9,000 as part of an upcoming project to add or replace aging sidewalks along Franklin and Ivy streets. Under city code, residents are assessed for a portion of the sidewalk work adjacent to their property. On top of last year’s significant property tax increase, the options to stretch sidewalk payments out over several years or defer payment until the house is sold do not provide the couple adequate financial relief, Kimble told Montana Free Press. “Why is Missoula making it harder for two seniors on a fixed income to stay in their home?” she asked. Although Missoula’s sidewalk program has evolved over the past 12 years to address rising costs, the Ivy/Franklin Greenway project resurfaced concerns over the burden on property owners. In response to residents’ objections, three city council members are working on a proposal to do away with the assessments. “At the end of the day, sidewalk is part of the transportation system, and I think the city should pay the full cost,” said Daniel Carlino, Missoula City Council member for Ward 3, which includes Rose Park. “We still want sidewalks to happen but don’t agree on forcing people to pay thousands of dollars.” RISING COSTS SPUR CHANGES The discussion around property owners’ share of sidewalk costs is not new and often resurfaces when the council approves a new project. About one-third of Missoula’s total street miles lack sidewalks, adding up to more than 200 miles without pedestrian infrastructure, according to the city. Filling in those gaps is a long-term challenge, as the city typically builds one to three miles per year, according to the city’s Public Works and Mobility Department. Missoula requires new construction to include sidewalks, but as old neighborhoods built without sidewalks fill in, the lack of that infrastructure is more of a problem, Jeremy Keene, public works director, said during a 2022 presentation detailing the sidewalk program. Before 2012, property owners paid fully to add sidewalks adjacent to their property. To help residents offset rising costs, the city established a cost-sharing formula where it would pay up to $11,500. In 2017, the council increased that to $16,500 as construction expenses and project bids increased. After public outcry in 2018 over a Slant Streets neighborhood sidewalk project that would have assessed 173 properties — including more than a dozen for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 — late mayor John Engen canceled the project, [the Missoulian reported at the time.](https://missoulian.com/news/local/missoula-curbs-sidewalk-projects-for-now/article_2de16f5a-2b42-53fc-8561-b8a135b03f09.html) Kimble’s Rose Park neighborhood home was part of that project as well, with her assessment nearly $39,000, she said. The city council and staff reworked the cost-sharing formula, removing curb, gutter and associated street work expenses from the property owner assessment. Under the current rules, which took effect in 2020, property owners are assessed for adjacent sidewalks, driveway approaches and boulevard work. For single-family homes and duplexes, the city pays the first $1,000, then splits costs until the property owner hits $3,500. The city pays up to $12,000 more, then the city and property owner split costs until the property owner pays $5,500 more, capping the owner’s cost at $9,000. Assessments vary based on project and property, but most one- or two-family residences pay $3,500 or less, said Monte Sipe, Missoula’s surface project manager. Corner parcels typically range from $3,500 to $9,000, he said. For the recent Eaton Street sidewalk project, properties that surpassed the $1,000 threshold were assessed $255 to $8,400. The council created a separate formula for multifamily, commercial and industrial properties. The city and property owner similarly split costs until the project total hits $20,000. The property owner pays anything higher than that amount, capping the city’s cost at $16,500. Property owners can pay the assessment in full or over eight, 12 or 20 years. Residential properties with an assessment of more than $6,000 or those making less than 80% of the area median income can defer payment until the sale of their home. The amount deferred accrues interest, plus an administrative fee required by state law. It’s common for cities nationwide to assess property owners for sidewalks, with many still billed the full cost, Sipe said. Missoula offers a higher subsidy than many other jurisdictions, he said. “We have a good program that attempts the best we can to offset impacts to property owners,” Sipe said. “I think we are ahead of the game.” The amount of assessments the city collects annually varies, depending on the number and size of sidewalk projects, but is typically $100,000 to $250,000 per project, Sipe said. Annually, the city budgets about $465,000 for sidewalk projects and uses gas tax money and, if applicable, transportation impact fees to fully fund projects, said Kevin Slovarp, city engineer for surface transportation. Property owner assessments will pay for about 10% of the total estimated $1.7 million cost of the first phase of the project near Rose Park — adding or improving sidewalk along Ivy and Franklin from South Fourth Street West to Woodford Street — said Ross Mollenhauer, Public Works and Mobility engineering manager. HOW DO PROJECTS GET CHOSEN? In recent years, the city shifted from building sidewalks outward from Missoula’s inner core to choosing from areas seeing infill development or specific corridors in need of sidewalks, according to the public works department. The city council developed sidewalk project scoring criteria in 2019 that include: conformity to plans; connectivity to other sidewalks, trails or bus routes; access to key destinations like schools, parks and grocery stores; ability to leverage funding or redevelopment; and readiness. The scoring heavily weighs safety and equity, or how the project addresses underserved neighborhoods. Staff prioritize and recommend projects based on the criteria, but ultimately the council decides on and budgets sidewalk work. The Ivy/Franklin/Park Greenway project links several neighborhoods and connects to the California Street pedestrian bridge, as well as trails, bike lanes and other greenways, according to a document describing the project. Greenways are low-traffic neighborhood streets that prioritize pedestrian and bicycle travel, according to the city. It also provides a safe route to school for Paxson Elementary, Lewis and Clark Elementary and Washington Middle School. The project is 16th on the city’s list of recommendations. Kimble said she, Fleischman and her neighbors questioned why it was moved ahead of other projects. On Nov. 27, before the city council voted on ordering phase one of the Ivy/Franklin project forward, a handful of neighborhood residents voiced concerns about the cost and necessity of the project. Mike Bader, 65, told the council his $6,400 assessment estimate is “kind of a tough pill.” “I just got a 28% increase on my property taxes, and it doesn’t really end,” he said. “I think sidewalks and curbs are really good, they really improve neighborhoods. … But the hardship on individual homeowners is pretty steep.” Gwen Jones, Ward 3 council member, said while the timing is bad, the city has limited money and resources for sidewalk projects. “We still want to have some level of funding formula to get more infrastructure put in,” she said during the meeting. “I know this is a big project. A ton of work has gone into it and it’s queued up, it’s ready to go. We modified the funding formula as much as possible to make it more workable for the residents. There are a lot of folks in Missoula who paid 100% for their sidewalks, so this is a much better situation than those days.” Council member Kristen Jordan pushed back on the claim that the project has priority because Franklin Street is a major walkway for school kids. Children walk on other nearby streets because Franklin does not have traffic lights at intersections with major roads like Stephens Avenue and Brooks Street, she said. While staff and council have worked to alleviate the burden on homeowners, there’s always room for improvement, Jordan said during the meeting. “I would definitely like to get to the point where we can pay for this out of general tax dollars,” she said. “I’m not sure where it would come from, and I think that’s the main problem because these are city assets.” The city council voted 10-2 to move the project ahead. Bids are due Friday, Jan. 26, and the city will send property owners letters with updated assessment estimates and dates of upcoming committee and council meetings when the project will be considered. In the coming weeks, the council will also consider a resolution drafted by council members Carlino, Jordan and Sandra Vasecka requiring the city to cover the full cost of sidewalk projects and no longer assess property owners. The proposal should go before the public works committee on the first or second Wednesday of February, Carlino said. While the draft resolution does not propose a specific alternative funding source, Carlino told MTFP the council could increase the sidewalk budget, amounting to a small cost to many residents rather than large bills for a few. “It’s really not a big cost to the city but can be a big cost to individual households,” he said. Without an additional funding source, doing away with the assessment program would reduce the amount of sidewalk projects the city can do, Mollenhauer said. While many council members who voted for the project said during the meeting on Nov. 27 that they would be open to future changes to the sidewalk program, affected residents urged the council to act before the Ivy/Franklin project goes ahead. “We could be priced out of our houses,” Bader, the Rose Park resident, told MTFP. “We don’t want them to say, ‘You inspired us to change our policy without us actually helping you.’ That’s not right. It wouldn’t bring us any comfort at all. It wouldn’t reduce our financial burden one penny.” In-depth, independent reporting on the stories impacting your community from reporters who know your town. latest stories [Northwest addiction treatment centers will remain open after state inspections](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/01/25/northwest-addiction-treatment-centers-will-remain-open-after-state-inspections/) A company that operates 86 treatment beds between two addiction treatment centers in northwest Montana will stay open following state investigations into poor admissions practices, inadequate documentation of treatment plans and a failure to appropriately report serious incidents.

    "title": "¿Habrá NUEVO corte de agua en CDMX y Edomex? Este es el nivel del Cutzamala tras LLUVIAS de agosto - Terra México",
    "text": "¿Nueva Sequía? ¿Habrá NUEVO corte de agua en CDMX y Edomex? Este es el nivel del Cutzamala tras LLUVIAS de agostoPese a que se proyectaba que el 'Día Cero' estaba muy cerca, la presencia de lluvias en agosto propone un cambio de planes. Luego de las fuertes lluvias que se presentan en este mes de agosto, las condiciones de sequía parecen ser cosa del pasado, al menos para la zona metropolitana del valle de México. Pero para tener certeza sobre algún nuevo corte de agua en CDMX y Edomex, se puede consultar cuál ese el nivel de captación con el que cuenta el Sistema Cutzamala, principal represa de esta zona del país, para despejar las dudas. Antes de la llegada de las lluvias de agosto, el nivel de gua en el Sistema Cutzamala se encontraba en nivel crítico pero, debido a las fuetes precipitaciones que han caído tanto en CDMX como en Edomex, esta situación mejoró en las últimas semanas. Sin embargo, esta situación no impide que haya un nuevo corte de agua, debido a que, podrían ser necesarias obras de mantenimiento de las tuberías. La crisis hídrica que afectó al valle de México provocó fuertes afectaciones en diversas alcaldías y municipios de la CDMX y Edomex, por lo que la incertidumbre sobre un nuevo corte de agua es grande. Aunque las autoridades pusieron lo necesario para brindar el abasto de líquido, la realidad es que la demanda es muy superior y por ello se depende enteramente del nivel del Sistema Cutzamala para lograrlo. Este es el nivel del Cutzamala tras lluvias de agosto Tras las lluvias del mes de agosto, el Sistema Cutzamala recuperó 68 millones 108 mil metros cúbicos de agua, para reportar un nivel del 34.95% de almacenamiento actualmente. Estos niveles garantizan que la CDMX y Edomex tengan un correcto abasto del vital líquido por lo que no se prevé un nuevo corte de agua para las alcaldías o municipios que componen estas dos entidades. Hace un par de meses se especuló con la posible llegada del 'Día Cero', en el que se especulaba que la CDMX y Edomex se quedarían sin el vital líquido. Sin embargo, debido a la presencia de fenómenos climáticos se hicieron presentes fuertes lluvias que en este mes de agosto pueden ayudar a que el nivel del Cutzamala se recupere, cuando anteriormente rondaba límites del 30%. Sin embargo, para estar seguro que un nuevo corte de agua no afectará tu comunidad, la recomendación es mantenerse al tanto de los avisos que hagan las alcaldías o municipios de CDMX y Edomex, con respecto a esto ya que, por obras de saneamiento o fallas en el sistema, se puede suspender el servicio independientemente del nivel que presente el Cutzamala.",

    "title": "Qué falló en las alertas de la dana: “La gente no estaba bien informada. Sacó los coches y los camiones como un día normal” | Clima y Medio Ambiente | EL PAÍS",
    "text": "La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) informó por primera vez de la gestación de una dana el 20 de octubre en la predicción general para España, y en las siguientes jornadas lanzó diversas advertencias que el lunes 28 de octubre a las 22.48 ya se habían convertido en un aviso rojo para distintos puntos del levante. El día del desastre, el martes 29, a las 9.41 de la mañana, la Aemet elevó el código rojo para toda la provincia de Valencia, el nivel de advertencia meteorológica más alto que existe. ¿Qué falló para que esta brutal gota fría pillara por sorpresa a muchos ciudadanos muchas horas después? El líder del PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, atacó a organismos públicos como la Aemet y la Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar para librar de responsabilidades al presidente valenciano, Carlos Mazón. “Le aseguro que un presidente autonómico gestiona en función de la información que recibe, y la información que se recibe dependen de organismos con competencia exclusiva del Gobierno central, véase la Aemet o la Confederación Hidrográfica. Nadie puede tomar decisiones en función de una información que puede ser exacta, inexacta, mejorable. Las decisiones se toman en función de la información que te facilitan en cada momento”. Para Jorge Olcina, catedrático de la Universidad de Alicante que imparte clases de Ordenación del Territorio, Climatología y Riesgos Naturales, “en este caso la alerta [roja] de la Aemet estuvo bien dada, llegó en la tarde-noche del lunes. Y la gente debería ser consciente de que con una alerta roja no se puede salir de casa , lo que nadie contemplaba es que la gente saliera, la gente sacó los coches y los camiones como si fuera un día normal. Ahí estuvo un poco la clave del número de víctimas”, asegura este experto. El sistema de avisos de fenómenos meteorológicos adversos en España funciona de acuerdo al plan Meteoalerta . Es la Aemet la que va dando avisos de colores verdes, amarillo, naranjas o rojos, en función del grado de amenaza. Se trata de un método de colores armonizado con el resto de países europeos que va generando información regular accesible a todo el mundo. Ahí termina el trabajo de los meteorólogos, pues luego corresponde a los servicios de emergencias ―dependientes de las comunidades autónomas― mandar las alertas a los ciudadanos cuando la situación de riesgo así lo requiera. “En la parte de la gestión de la emergencia, la de protección civil, la gente no estaba realmente bien informada, se enteró por los medios, por las radios o por las redes”, incide Olcina, que recalca que la alerta a los móviles llegó el martes por la tarde. Así se refiere al mensaje de SMS recibido en teléfonos de la ciudad de Valencia a las 20.03 , usando el sistema Es-Alert, en el que Protección Civil pedía a los ciudadanos que evitaran cualquier tipo de desplazamiento en la provincia, cuando barrancos y ríos ya estaban desbordados en varios municipios del área metropolitana. En otros puntos de Valencia, el mensaje llegó todavía más tarde, cuando la situación ya era desesperada para muchos ciudadanos. “En un aviso rojo, hay que pedir a la población que se quede en casa. En ciertas zonas de Murcia prohibieron el movimiento de coches y suspendieron las clases el día anterior”, recalca en un entrevista el meteorólogo Francisco Martín León. Lo mismo en lo que incide Olcina, “cuando ya se sabe que es un código rojo, enseguida hay que mandar la alerta precautoria, aconsejando no salir de casa”. Según el catedrático de la Universidad de Alicante, “hoy en día con el nivel de riesgo que tenemos, porque el cambio climático está intensificando todos estos fenómenos, esa parte de aviso a la población es fundamental”. Sin embargo, considera que “está fallando, y no solo ahora en Valencia; Aemet da el aviso oportuno, pero luego no llega como debería a la población”. La socióloga Guadalupe Ortiz también considera que el aviso rojo de la Aemet no fue suficientemente tenido en cuenta. Sin embargo, incide en que no es el momento de echar la culpa a nadie, pues defiende que lo que está fallando es el sistema en general. “Con el cambio climático, hay que ponerse a trabajar urgentemente en la gestión de riesgos”, señala. Tras la dana de septiembre de 2019 que afectó de forma severa a la comarca alicantina de La Vega Baja del Segura (Alicante), Ortiz fue una de las investigadoras del Observatorio Socioeconómico de Inundaciones y Sequías de la Universidad de Alicante que se puso a estudiar los mensajes de alerta para ver cómo mejorarlos, dentro del proyecto VegaRenhace impulsado por el anterior gobierno de la Comunidad Valenciana (y que no continuó con la llegada del popular Carlos Mazón de la mano de Vox). Como explica la socióloga, vieron que durante aquella dana la centralita del 112 se había colapsado con llamadas de gente que no pedía ayuda sino información. “La gente no sabía cómo informarse”, señala Ortiz, que considera que esta es una cuestión clave para afrontar este tipo de emergencias. Los sociólogos de este observatorio analizaron miles de llamadas al 112 durante aquella emergencia y a partir de la información obtenida crearon una biblioteca de mensajes de alerta que pudieran usarse para llegar mejor a la población en caso de inundaciones como las ocurridas esta semana. “Nosotros dimos a la administración ese catálogo de mensajes, pero no sé si se han llegado a utilizar alguna vez”, recalca. Esta biblioteca de mensajes tiene en cuenta todas las fases de una emergencia de forma que la ciudadanía disponga de información útil que mejore su seguridad. Incluye avisos para los desplazamientos en coche: “Evite cualquier tipo de desplazamiento por carretera a menos que sea estrictamente necesario. Tenga en cuenta que la mayoría de muertes en episodios de lluvia se producen al volante”. Pero también para preparar la casa, la seguridad de las personas, el cuidado de animales, cómo reaccionar ante inundaciones… o incluso evitar los bulos. “Disponga en casa de alimentos y agua para al menos tres días. Procure almacenar alimentos en conserva o envasados que no requieran refrigeración ni cocinado. Almacene entre 2 y 3 litros de agua por persona y día”. “No haga caso de los bulos y no difunda rumores sobre la situación de emergencia entre sus familiares y allegados. Haga únicamente caso a la información ofrecida por fuentes oficiales. Infórmese a través de medios de comunicación de confianza y de cuentas oficiales de redes sociales como la de [X]”. Como explica Ortiz, “no basta con alertar del fenómeno meteorológico sin más, hay que dar mensajes claros a la población indicando lo que tiene que hacer en un lenguaje que lo entienda”. Según detalla la socióloga, este proyecto coincidió con la llegada a España del sistema Es-Alert para mandar mensajes de forma masiva a los móviles de la población, por ello consideraban que estos podían ser muy útiles para mandar recomendaciones a los teléfonos, pero también podían difundirse en redes o en canales que la ciudadanía sepa que son fiables. Los cerca de 90 mensajes de la biblioteca elaborada pueden ayudar a los ciudadanos tanto en los momentos anteriores a la emergencia como después: “Antes de conectar el interruptor general de la corriente eléctrica y abrir las llaves de paso del agua y el gas, asegúrese de que se encuentran en buen estado”, dice uno de ellos. ¿Por qué estás viendo esto?",
