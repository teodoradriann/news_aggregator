    "text": "The King and I actress Maureen Hingert, a star of Hollywood’s Golden Age, has died at the age of 88 following health complications.\nThe Sri Lankan actress and Miss Universe runner-up died Sunday of liver failure at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, California, her daughter Marisa Zamparelli told The Hollywood Reporter .\n“It was a beautiful and peaceful passing,” Marisa said.\nHingert was widely known for her work in Walter Lang’s 1956 film, The King and I, adapted from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical of the same name. The musical, which earned nine nominations at the Academy Awards and won five, notably starred Deborah Kerr, Yul Brynner, and Rita Moreno.\nHingert starred in “Gunmen from Laredo” opposite Robert Knapp and Walter Coy. LMPC via Getty Images Alongside The King and I, Hingert’s resume also includes roles in Westerns like 1958’s Gun Fever and 1959’s Gunmen From Laredo. She also has appeared in dramas like 1956’s Pillars of the Sky opposite Jeff Chandler and Dorothy Malone, and 1954’s Elephant Walk starring Elizabeth Taylor.\nApart from acting, Hingert also made a legacy as a pageant contestant when she finished second runner-up at the 1955 Miss Universe contest—the first in the competition’s history to ever be televised.\nHingert (second from right) entered the Miss Universe competition as Miss Ceylon. Bettmann Archive via Getty Images Hingert, who was born in Colombo, Ceylon in January 1937, entered the competition as Miss Ceylon—a historical name for Sri Lanka—and was the first from the country to ever reach the contest’s finals. She was only 18 at the time.\nIn 1958, Hingert married Mario Armond Zamparelli, a designer largely known for his work with business tycoon and aerospace engineer Howard Hughes. The couple welcomed three children together before their divorce in 1970.\nAlongside their daughter Maria, Hingert and Mario also welcomed daughters Gina Zamparelli and Andrea Zamparelli who respectively died in 2018 and 2009.\nThe post ‘The King and I’ Star and Miss Universe Legend Maureen Hingert Dies at 88 appeared first on The Daily Beast .",

    "text": "Declines in energy and transport tax meant New Zealand’s total environmental taxes fell by 21% to $5.2 billion in the twelve months to March 2023, according to Stats NZ.\nStats NZ released the environmental-economic accounts for the 2022-2023 financial period on Thursday which show how NZ’s environment contributes to the economy and the impacts of economic activity on the environment.\nThe data out of Stats NZ showed environmental taxes for the March 2022-2023 period came to $5.2 billion, $1.4 billion lower than in the March 2021–2022 period.\n“Environmental taxes include the amount of energy, transport, pollution, and resource taxes paid to the Government for something that has a proven scientific negative impact on the environment,” Stats NZ said.\nThe total environmental tax figure of $5.2 billion, was made up mostly from transport at 51% and energy at 45%.\nStats NZ said in the March-2023 period, the energy tax base fell 34% or $1.2 billion and the transport tax base was down 10% or $290 million. However, the pollution tax base jumped 63% or $38 million.\nStats NZ attributed the environmental taxes decline in the March-2023 year being primarily from the $1.2 billion fall in the energy tax base.\nA drop in taxes on greenhouse gases due to the implementation of an updated Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) taxes methodology contributed to the energy tax base fall, as did the removal of some taxes associated with the closure of the Marsden Point oil refinery, Stats NZ said.\n“Taxes from the energy base comprised 45% of environmental tax taken during the year to March 2023, down from 54% during the previous year,” Stats NZ said.\nStats NZ said the asset value of all sources of renewable inputs to electricity generation fell by 17% or $2.8 billion to $13.7 billion in the March-2023 year.\nIn 2023, 69% of the asset value of renewables came from hydro generation, 21% from geothermal, 7.5% from wind, 1.1% from wood, 0.8% from solar, and 0.7% from biogas.\n“Solar was the only generation type to show an asset value increase in the March 2023 year, up 1.2% on the previous year,” Stats NZ said.\nThe fall in transport base taxes was from taxes associated with vehicle and road use charges. Road user charges and petrol excise duty was reduced during the March-2023 year by the Labour Government at the time as a response to the higher cost of living.\nStats NZ said increases in taxes from the pollution base were from taxes associated with the waste disposal levy which raises revenue for initiatives that reduce waste.\nOn the up\nStats NZ said the marine economy contributed $4.6 billion to NZ’s gross domestic product (GDP) during the 2023 financial period.\nThis was an increase of 7.9% compared with the prior year when the marine economy contributed $4.2 billion.\nThe contribution of the marine economy to GDP in the March-2023 year came to 1.2%.\nShipping was the largest contributor to the marine economy at 52%, followed by fisheries and aquaculture at 24%.\nOffshore minerals contributed 16%, marine services contributed 5.1% and marine tourism and recreation contributed 2.6%. Government and defence contributed just 0.3%.\nStats NZ said the number of wage and salary earners in the total marine economy rose by 582 to 39,237 in the March-2023 year.\nWhen it came to central and local government expenditure on environmental protection, local government contributed 68% or $1.9 billion compared to central government which contributed 32% or $904 million.\nTogether, local and central government spent a total of $2.9 billion which was an increase of 15% from the prior year.\nStats NZ said this expenditure was spent on activities that prevented, reduced, and eliminated pollution as well as other forms of environmental degradation in NZ.\nWe welcome your comments below.

Jogador deve iniciar a fisioterapia no Reffis nos próximos diasO atacante Calleri passou por cirurgia nesta quarta-feira (23) por conta de uma ruptura no ligamento cruzado anterior do joelho esquerdo. O São Paulo informou que o procedimento foi bem sucedido, e o jogador deve ter alta nos próximos dias. Assim, iniciará o processo de recuperação no Reffis.\nA lesão do argentino ocorreu ainda no primeiro tempo do jogo contra o Botafogo, no Estádio Nilton Santos, na última semana. O camisa 9 disputou bola no alto com Marlon Freitas e se machucou na queda. Calleri ainda tentou permanecer em campo mais alguns minutos, porém caiu novamente no gramado e pediu substituição.\nÉ + que streaming. É arte, cultura e história.\nDessa maneira, o atacante será desfalque por um longo período. Afinal, o tempo de recuperação para este tipo de lesão varia de seis a nove meses, de acordo com cada jogador.\nCom a ausência de Calleri, o técnico Luis Zubeldía deve optar por André Silva como titular. Contra o Botafogo, o substituto do argentino fez um gol no empate em 2 a 2, fora de casa. O jovem Ryan Francisco é outra opção para o setor.\nO argentino não é o único no departamento médico do Tricolor. Outros importantes jogadores que se tratam no Reffis são: Pablo Maia (cirurgia no tornozelo direito), Lucas Moura (trauma no joelho direito), Luiz Gustavo (tromboembolismo pulmonar), Arboleda (sobrecarga muscular) e Oscar (lesão na coxa esquerda).",

    "text": "(CNN) -- A partir del 1 de enero, un medicamento que ayuda a respirar a miles de pacientes desaparecerá de las farmacias, y a los médicos les preocupa que los pacientes puedan tener problemas para cambiar a otras alternativas y conseguir que el seguro las cubra.\nEl fabricante GSK anunció que dejará de comercializar el inhalador Flovent para el asma y que, en su lugar, fabricará una versión \"genérica autorizada\", idéntica pero sin la misma marca.\nLos médicos que tratan a pacientes con asma afirman que el genérico autorizado funcionará igual de bien que el medicamento de marca, pero no parece tener la misma cobertura por parte de las aseguradoras. Eso puede significar que los pacientes tendrán que obtener nuevas recetas y sortear obstáculos de cobertura en plena temporada de virus respiratorios.\n\"Este medicamento ha sido el fármaco inhalado más utilizado en los últimos 25 o 30 años\", afirma la Dra.

El hecho de que se suspenda supondrá un golpe enorme para el sistema, tanto para los pacientes como para las familias y los médicos\".\nLos médicos instan a los pacientes a que tomen medidas ahora para asegurarse de que disponen de su medicación de cara al nuevo año, y los grupos de defensa de los derechos de los pacientes han intentado hacer correr la voz.\nPero la historia de la desaparición de Flovent y la falta de cobertura de su sustituto, aparentemente idéntico, afecta a algunas de las facetas más complejas de la atención sanitaria y los precios de los medicamentos en Estados Unidos.\nCVS cambiará la forma en que fija los precios de los medicamentos recetados en EE.UU. ¿que significa?\nImportante cambio en el programa de medicamentos de Medicaid\nUna portavoz de GSK dijo que la compañía está haciendo el cambio \"como parte de nuestro compromiso de ser ambiciosos para los pacientes\".\nSeñaló que la compañía introdujo los genéricos autorizados de Flovent HFA, un aerosol de inhalación, y Flovent Diskus, un polvo de inhalación, en mayo de 2022 y octubre de 2023, y que, posteriormente, dejaría de fabricar las versiones de patente en Estados Unidos el 1 de enero de 2024.\nLos genéricos autorizados, dijo, \"proporcionarán a los pacientes en EE.UU. alternativas potencialmente más baratas de estos productos médicamente importantes\".\nSin embargo, los expertos que siguen la industria tanto en Wall Street como en el mundo académico señalan que GSK está haciendo el cambio precisamente en el momento en que un cambio en los reembolsos de Medicaid podría hacer que la empresa tuviera que pagar grandes multas debido a los aumentos de precio de Flovent durante varios años.\nFarmacéuticos advierten que los medicamentos “suben por encima de la inflación”\nEl cambio legal que entrará en vigor el 1 de enero suprime un límite a los reembolsos de Medicaid que las empresas están obligadas a pagar si aumentan el precio de los medicamentos por encima de la inflación.\n\"Flovent Diskus lleva en el mercado desde 2000 y Flovent HFA desde 2004, y GSK ha subido el precio de ambos productos en numerosas ocasiones desde su lanzamiento\", declaró a CNN el Dr. William Feldman, médico adjunto de la División de Medicina Pulmonar y Cuidados Críticos del Hospital Brigham and Women's que estudia los medicamentos para el asma. \"Estos son precisamente el tipo de fármacos que se verán afectados por la nueva política que elimina el tope de reembolso de Medicaid\".\nHasta ahora, los reembolsos tenían un tope en el precio total de un medicamento, por lo que los fabricantes nunca pagarían más de lo que cuesta un medicamento de vuelta a Medicaid.\nPero en virtud de una disposición de la Ley del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense de 2021, ese límite se eliminó, y a partir del 1 de enero de 2024, los medicamentos que han estado sujetos a grandes aumentos de precios a lo largo del tiempo podrían terminar incurriendo en reembolsos a Medicaid que son mayores que su precio, lo que significa que las compañías farmacéuticas venderían esos medicamentos a Medicaid con pérdidas.\n\"Obviamente, las farmacéuticas no quieren vender con pérdidas nada de su cartera\", afirma Andrew Baum, analista de GSK y otras farmacéuticas para la firma financiera Citi. \"Así que busca evadir el impacto mediante, uno: la discontinuación y dos: el genérico autorizado\".\nUn genérico autorizado, dijo Baum a CNN, es visto como un producto separado, \"pero aún permite a la farmacéutica recoger parte de la rentabilidad\".\nO, dicho de otro modo, es el mismo producto sin la marca y también sin el historial de subidas de precio que dejarían al medicamento vulnerable a esos grandes reembolsos a Medicaid.\nSegún datos de GoodRx, el precio de la marca Flovent ha subido alrededor del 47% desde 2014.\nOtros fabricantes de medicamentos también han hecho cambios antes de la eliminación del límite de reembolso del 1 de enero. Los fabricantes de insulina anunciaron este año importantes recortes de precios, del 70% o más, en sus productos, una medida que los analistas estiman que les ahorrará cientos de millones de dólares al año.\nLa estrategia de genéricos autorizados que está empleando GSK \"es una forma, en términos generales, de maximizar la rentabilidad del producto en cuestión\", dijo David Amsellem, analista financiero que cubre el sector en la firma de inversión Piper Sandler.\nAmsellem señaló que actualmente no hay otras versiones genéricas de Flovent aprobadas por la FDA.\nPor ejemplo, un envase de Flovent HFA en la dosis de 110 microgramos cuesta US$ 273,83, aproximadamente un 50% más que el costo de adquisición al por mayor de US$ 177,99 de su homólogo genérico autorizado, según los precios que la empresa comunicó a CNN. El costo de adquisición al por mayor es el precio antes de seguros y descuentos.\nPero CVS Caremark, un importante gestor de beneficios farmacéuticos que determina qué medicamentos están cubiertos por el seguro para sus miembros, está dando un lugar preferencial a otro inhalador de marca, Pulmicort, en su formulario, en lugar de las versiones genéricas autorizadas de Flovent.\n\"En este caso, los genéricos autorizados eran más caros que los medicamentos de marca\", dijo un portavoz de CVS a CNN. Señaló que se basa en los precios netos, en lugar del costo de adquisición al por mayor, lo que significa que Pulmicort podría ser menos costoso debido a los descuentos que su fabricante, AstraZeneca, paga para obtener una mejor cobertura de seguro.\n\"El peor momento del año\"\nEl hecho de que los planes de seguro no estén cubriendo ampliamente el genérico autorizado de Flovent, dijo Cohen de BMC, \"significa que los pacientes van a tener que obtener una nueva receta para un medicamento completamente diferente en medio de la peor época posible del año, que es la temporada de virus respiratorios de invierno\".\nPara los pacientes con asma persistente, dijo Cohen, Flovent ha sido el medicamento antiinflamatorio preventivo diario más utilizado durante décadas. Contrae la inflamación de las vías respiratorias y reduce la respuesta exagerada del organismo a los desencadenantes que dificultan la respiración.\nA medida que los virus respiratorios se propagan por todas partes, ¿qué debes hacer si te enfermas?\nDurante la temporada de influenza y resfriados, dice, es aún más importante disponer de ese medicamento diario.\n\"La influenza, el covid, el virus respiratorio sincitial, todos estos virus que circulan en estos momentos, son uno de los principales desencadenantes, si no el principal, de los ataques de asma en los niños\", explica Cohen. \"Esto es lo que hace que los niños lleguen a urgencias\".\nCohen dijo que le preocupa que los pacientes, así como los médicos y farmacéuticos, no sepan sobre este cambio sobre Flovent, y tienen que actuar ahora para encontrar alternativas y determinar la cobertura del seguro.\nVirus respiratorios amenazan a EE.UU.: ¿cómo debemos protegernos?\nPara algunos grupos, las alternativas son más limitadas. Para los pacientes con una enfermedad inflamatoria más rara, llamada esofagitis eosinofílica (EoE), Flovent HFA es uno de los esteroides tópicos más recetados, y otros medicamentos no tienen tantos datos que respalden su uso en la enfermedad, dijo la Dra. Erin Syverson, médica adjunta de la División de Gastroenterología, Hepatología y Nutrición del Hospital Infantil de Boston.\nDado que la EoE afecta al esófago, los pacientes ingieren el medicamento en lugar de respirarlo, y éste puede controlar la inflamación que puede causar dolor al tragar o que la comida se atasque, lo que requiere procedimientos para extraerla. Según Syverson, en los niños la EoE puede provocar vómitos recurrentes, ardor y dolor de estómago, y dificultades para empezar a tomar alimentos sólidos.\n\"Me preocupa que la interrupción del tratamiento vaya a suponer un obstáculo más para una población de pacientes que ya dispone de una medicación muy limitada\", declaró Syverson a CNN. \"No sé cómo será enero, pero estoy preocupada\".\n-- Tami Luhby de CNN contribuyó con este reportaje.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "As we reported earlier, the Colorado GOP has now filed an appeal to the United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) of the Colorado Supreme Court decision that booted former President Donald Trump off the ballot under the 14th Amendment, claiming he'd committed insurrection.\nAdvertisement See also :\nTrump Ballot Ban: Colorado GOP Appeals to US Supreme Court\nColorado Decision's Concerning Take Turns Speech on Its Head and Could Lead to Chaos\nThe Colorado Supreme Court said in its opinion it was putting a stay on the decision, which would remain in place if there was an appeal to SCOTUS.\nBut we stay our ruling until January 4, 2024 (the day before the Secretary’s deadline to certify the content of the presidential primary ballot). If review is sought in the Supreme Court before the stay expires, it shall remain in place, and the Secretary will continue to be required to include President Trump’s name on the 2024 presidential primary ballot until the receipt of any order or mandate from the Supreme Court.\nThe Trump team has also said that it plans to appeal.\nSo, while the left was celebrating the decision, the final decision is going to be up to the Supreme Court, and Trump was going to remain on the primary ballot, because the appeal was a foregone conclusion.\nSome are reporting this as putting Trump \"back\" on the ballot, but technically he was never off it, given the stay.\nNow that there is an appeal, the Colorado Secretary of State issued a statemen t that Trump would remain on the ballot, much to the chagrin of people on the left.\nAdvertisement Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced that Trump will for the time being remain on the ballot, which goes to print on January 5 – unless the Supreme Court affirms the lower court's ruling or otherwise declines to take on the appeal.\nGriswold was required to comply with the Colorado Supreme Court decision; that's why she issued the statement that she did.\nBut the Democrat was not at all happy with having to do so, as her post on X made clear. It sounds like she is having a meltdown that her hands are now effectively tied.\nDonald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.\n— Jena Griswold (@JenaGriswold) December 28, 2023 Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.\nTalk about throwing a small fit there. Sounds like someone doesn't like the fact that she has to act in accordance with the stay. But it's the Colorado Supreme Court that also ordered the stay, so I guess by her logic, that's right, too. Trump was not convicted of insurrection, because he was never charged with it. Plus, in order to be charged with it, you have to have an insurrection. A riot and an insurrection are not the same thing. Nor was Trump accorded proper due process by Colorado in its decision, as one of its own justices noted in his dissent.\nAdvertisement Dissent in Colorado Case on Trump Lays Out Roadmap for SCOTUS to Overturn Decision\nSo now, the SCOTUS can decide not to take it up or take the appeal. It seems likely they will take it up, given varying decisions on the matter in different courts and the interpretation of the 14th Amendment needing to be settled. But everything stays in place until then.",

    "text": "Las aplicaciones móviles que nos permiten saber el tiempo nos ayudan a planificar nuestras actividades, evitar imprevistos relacionados con el clima y estar informados sobre condiciones peligrosas que se puedan producir. Estas apps se han convertido en algo que siempre debemos de consultar en el móvil para anticipar las condiciones meteorológicas. Por ello, un grupo de investigadores de la Universidad de Reading, Inglaterra, ha realizado un estudio para determinar cuál es la mejor de todas.\n¿Cuál es la mejor app para saber el tiempo? El estudio, liderado por la científica meteorológica Rosie Mammatt, se llevó a cabo durante dos semanas y evaluaron cinco de las aplicaciones más utilizadas: BBC Weather, Met Office, Apple Weather, The Weather Channel y AccuWeather . El equipo analizó su capacidad para ofrecer predicciones precisas a lo largo del día y los resultados revelaron importantes diferencias entre ellas.\nApple Weather cuenta con una interfaz atractiva, especialmente para los usuarios de iPhone, no siempre ofrece pronósticos precisos. BBC Weather , por ejemplo, destacó como una de las peores en cuanto a precisión y, por su parte, Met Office mostró una mejor fiabilidad en algunas franjas horarias, pero menos precisa en otras. AccuWeather ofreció buenos resultados, sobre todo para las primeras horas del día , pero para las condiciones de la tarde y la noche fue limitada. Finalmente, The Weather Channel se destacó como la mejor aplicación.\nQue el calor te pille preparado: el truco de tu móvil para que te lleguen alertas cuando sube la temperatura",
