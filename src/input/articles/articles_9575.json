    "text": "Heightened Security Alert at NATO Air Base in Germany Following Intelligence Reports The NATO air base in Geilenkirchen, Germany, has heightened its security level due to intelligence reports of a potential threat. This follows recent incidents including suspected sabotage and attempted trespassing. The safety of staff remains a priority as operations continue. NATO attributes these threats to increased Russian hostility. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 23-08-2024 03:11 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 03:11 IST The NATO air base in Geilenkirchen, Germany, has elevated its security protocols in response to intelligence reports indicating a potential threat, the base announced on Thursday. As a precaution, all non-mission essential staff have been sent home, though operations remain unaffected. A base spokesperson noted that no further information was available beyond the statement released on social media platform X. This marks the second time in recent weeks that security measures have been intensified at the base, which houses NATO's AWACS surveillance planes. Last week, the nearby military base in Cologne was briefly sealed off during an investigation into a suspected sabotage of its water supply. On the same day, an attempted trespassing incident at Geilenkirchen prompted a comprehensive security sweep. While the German military later dismissed contamination concerns at the Cologne base, NATO has raised alarms about increasing hostile activities, including sabotage and cyberattacks, allegedly orchestrated by Russia. Analysts have flagged several recent incidents as suspicious, highlighting a broader pattern of escalating tensions between NATO and Russia. (With inputs from agencies.)

    "text": "In a move to manage rising commuter traffic, the River Navigation Department (RND) has reintroduced traditional ferryboats alongside Ro-Ro ferries on the busy Ribandar–Chorao route during peak hours.\nSpeaking toO Heraldo, RND Director Vikramsinh N Rajebhosale said, “The traditional ferries will be operated in the morning and evening to clear the extra rush of passengers. Today also, we operated one ferry in the morning and two in the evening. This is being done to manage the rush. Anyway, the old boats which were earlier operating on the route are still available and can be used whenever required.”\nHe also clarified that the newly notified toll rates apply to the route as a whole, and not to any specific type of ferry service.\n\"The rates are for the route and not for type of ferry service,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Chodan-Madel Village Panchayat Sarpanch Ramakant Priolkar, along with other Panchayat members, met with the RND Directorate to request the deployment of two additional blue ferries to operate alongside the two existing Ro-Ro ferries during peak hours.\nThis move comes in the wake of a three-day ultimatum issued by Chorao villagers demanding the reinstatement of six traditional ferryboats, in addition to the two Ro-Ro ferries currently servicing the route.\nThe issue took a political turn when the Goa Legislative Assembly witnessed chaos on Tuesday over concerns related to the ongoing Ro-Ro ferry service, further highlighting the urgency of restoring adequate public transport on the Ribandar–Chorao stretch.",

Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses image used for representative purpose. (File Photo | Express) Express News Service Updated on: 28 Mar 2025, 4:54 am 1 min read\nCopied\nFollow Us\nCOIMBATORE: Conductors of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) working in Ondipudur branch-1 complain that the branch manager (BM) is forcing them to increase revenue and putting them under stress. The Ondipudur Branch I operates 78 services, including 42 under Vidiyal Payanam (free ride for women) scheme.\nA conductor from the branch who did not wish to be named, said the collection has come down due to Vidiyal Payanam and they are being forced to make up for the loss. “On an average, we collect Rs 2, 000-Rs 3, 000 daily in two shifts. The revenue will differ depending on the routes. The branch manager says collection is not enough and abuses us using foul language,” he said.\nAnother conductor charged that the manager marks employees absent for taking casual leave. He said 60 employees were marked as absent enmasse in the attendance register recently, despite all of them having leave balance. Members of a few unions, including those affiliated to the DMK, staged a protest in front of the depot on Tuesday and Wednesday, seeking the manager’s transfer.\nThey have threatened to go on strike if action is not taken against the manager within a week. Senior officers of TNSTC Coimbatore region are holding talks with the employees. When contacted, the branch manager Manivannan, said the charges against him were false.\nHe said a few conductors are working sincerely and generating maximum revenue of Rs 5,500 per day, but many are lethargic. When asked about being absent, several crew members have been going on leave frequently without informing him and it affected the operations.",

    "text": "The past 11 weeks have been an emotional one for us all. As you likely know, we launched a tefillin campaign on October 9th. Our original goal was to give out 30 pairs, but thanks to incredible support from donations and from men around the world committing to wearing tefillin every day for life, we expanded that goal. When the number of people murdered by Hamas rose to 1,200 we decided to get one pair of tefillin for every soul we lost on Simchas Torah. Donate to [tefillin for men around the world here](https://causematch.com/tefillin/) or donate to [IDF solider tefillin here](https://causematch.com/tefillin-for-soldiers)! Here are some updates from the past 11 weeks: - 3,551 Civilian Men committed to start wearing tefillin every day. - 5,266 IDF soldiers signed up to receive a pair of tefillin and start wearing them daily. - 1,078 pairs of tefillin have already been distributed. - 335 additional pairs of tefillin are currently being distributed. - 1 dedicated tefillin shop in Israel to work full time, checking and assembling tefillin to support this campaign, allowing us direct control and oversight of the kashrus. - 20+ member volunteer team spread across the world have been set up to verify the list of signups and ship/deliver tefillin. - 2 full time employees have been hired (via a direct donation) to optimize the impact of the campaign with logistics and connecting signups on the list to local rabbis. - 2 Campaigns currently raising money. As it stands now, we have just about used up the funds raised to produce and distribute the 1,413 pairs we have. To enable us to keep going, please donate and we can continue to produce and distribute tefillin to men who would otherwise not be wearing tefillin, but have committed to putting on for life! Donate to [tefillin for men around the world here](https://causematch.com/tefillin/) or donate to [IDF solider tefillin here](https://causematch.com/tefillin-for-soldiers)! I am very proud to say that 100% of the money raised has gone towards the production of tefillin and distribution (shipping cost) of those tefillin. The price of producing tefillin has gone up over the past 11 weeks and the exchange rate from USD to NIS has actually gone down in value by over 10% as well. With all that said, we have an incredible system in place to ensure the costs are as low as possible and the tzedaka money raised is utilized as best as humanly possible! Even all ads that we ran were only run via a directed donation, and the same goes for our two full time employees. Want to see some of the pairs given out? You can do so on [the Tefillin Connection Instagram page here](https://www.instagram.com/tefillinconnection/).",
