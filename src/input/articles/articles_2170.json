    "title": "Pioneering Klebsiella Pneumoniae Antibiotic Resistance Prediction With Artificial Intelligence-Clinical Decision Support System–Enhanced Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry: Retrospective Study",
    "text": "Original Paper\nAbstract\nBackground: The rising prevalence and swift spread of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB), especially Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), present a critical global health threat highlighted by the World Health Organization, with mortality rates soaring approximately 50% with inappropriate antimicrobial treatment.\nObjective: This study aims to advance a novel strategy to develop an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS) that combines machine learning (ML) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), aiming to significantly improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosing antibiotic resistance, directly addressing the grave health risks posed by the widespread dissemination of pan drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria across numerous countries.\nMethods: A comprehensive dataset comprising 165,299 bacterial specimens and 11,996 KP isolates was meticulously analyzed using MALDI-TOF MS technology.

Bacteremia caused by MDR-KP is linked to mortality rates as high as 47%, underlining the critical impact of multidrug resistance [ - ]. Initially, quinolones were highly effective against such infections due to their unique mechanism of action, distinct from β-lactams, targeting different bacterial processes [ , ]. However, increasing quinolone resistance among KP, driven by mutations in key enzyme regions, efflux pump overexpression, and plasmid-mediated mechanisms, undermines quinolone effectiveness, complicating infection management and underscoring the adaptability of bacterial resistance [ , ].\nThe emergence of quinolone resistance in KP strains within clinical settings indicates the critical demand for novel diagnostic techniques [- ]. Rapid and accurate detection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in patients is essential for controlling resistance spread [ , ]. Thus, the slow pace of culture-based diagnostics in addressing antibiotic resistance required shifting toward new, more agile strategies, emphasizing the need for quicker, more effective treatment options to navigate the challenges of rapidly evolving infections [ ].\nThe dynamic battle against antibiotic resistance necessitates quick-to-adapt diagnostic tools for effective management []. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is indispensable for the rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms [ , ]. Its application extends to the detection of virulence factors in antibiotic-resistant strains yet often transcends standard procedural bounds [ , ]. Combining machine learning (ML) with MALDI-TOF MS ushers in a novel paradigm for predicting antibiotic resistance [ ], specifically targeting quinolone-resistant KP.\nOur study introduces the development of an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS) designed to enhance the clinical decision-making process regarding the use of quinolones as a potential antibiotic option. Integrating the precision of MALDI-TOF MS technology with advanced ML algorithms, our system aims to equip health care professionals with quick and evidence-based recommendations for the optimal use of antibiotics tailored to individual patient needs. This innovative approach not only improves the rapidity and precision of identifying antibiotic resistance but also offers clinicians valuable insights, enabling prompt and well-informed treatment choices. Consequently, this facilitates improved patient outcomes and more effective combat against the proliferation of antibiotic resistance.\nMethods\nStudy Designs and Data Collection\nFrom January 2021 to December 2023, a comprehensive research project was undertaken by the Tri-Service General Hospital alongside 4 district hospitals, examining 165,299 bacterial specimens using advanced MALDI-TOF MS technology provided by bioMérieux, France. This study identified 11,996 specimens as KP, which were further subjected to antibiotic sensitivity testing (AST) for levofloxacin (LEV) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) using the VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux). This system is claimed to be precise in such assessments. The analysis of the AST results strictly adhered to the clinical breakpoints defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, ensuring that the study aligned with the established microbiological norms [, ].\nThe objective of this extensive analysis was to develop 2 predictive models: one to ascertain resistance to LEV and the other to CIP. The exclusion of 869 specimens from the LEV resistance analysis was necessary because of intermediate AST results, which refined the focus to 11,127 specimens for thorough investigation. Similarly, for CIP resistance, 373 specimens were excluded because of intermediate results, concentrating the analysis on 11,623 specimens. This detailed and systematic process emphasizes the rigor of the study and its commitment to deliver precise and reliable evaluations of antibiotic resistance among microbial specimens. The dataset was strategically divided as follows: samples collected from January to September were designated for training the models, whereas those collected from October to December served as the validation set. This temporal split was performed to simulate the application of the models in real-world settings.\nData Preprocessing and Feature Extraction\nOur research was initiated by extracting mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios and intensity values from MALDI-TOF MS data to establish an essential foundation. We addressed data imbalance through a resampling strategy using sklearn.utils, applying downsampling to over-represented classes and upsampling for underrepresented classes, thus balancing the dataset to diminish model bias and enhance generalization. In feature engineering, we segmented m/z ranges into 1-unit intervals, allowing a ± 2-unit tolerance for grouping similar observations. We then extracted and logarithmically transformed the peak intensity values for both the antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible strains within these segments. This crucial step normalizes the data, improves strain comparability, and enables precise identification of resistance pattern variations. We filtered out segments with a feature importance value below 0.01 as background noise, focusing our model on significant attributes to optimize performance and achieve our research objectives.\nML Model Development and Training\nTo detect LEV and CIP resistance in KP, we selected an array of sophisticated algorithms including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, XGBoost, and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM). This diverse selection was aimed at leveraging their distinct strengths for a more precise and comprehensive analysis. Our goal was to thoroughly explore antibiotic resistance patterns to improve treatment strategies and provide valuable insights into the management of microbial resistance. A grid search was performed for each model to determine the optimal parameters, enhancing accuracy and performance. The best parameters identified for each model are detailed in.\nModel Evaluation\nTo assess the accuracy of our predictive models, we used several key metrics, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1-score. These metrics provide a detailed evaluation of the effectiveness of the model and ensure that the findings are reliable and robust. Such a comprehensive evaluation method is vital for predicting antibiotic resistance.\nClinical Validation\nTo affirm the applicability of our models in real-world clinical settings, we conducted clinical validation at Tri-Service General Hospital using the validation dataset. During the validation period, we specifically validated 3339 cases of LEV resistance and 3487 cases of CIP resistance against traditional culture-based AST. We evaluated the predictive accuracy by analyzing sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F1-score.\nAI-CDSS Deployment\nWe created a web-based AI-CDSS specifically designed for health care professionals. This system leverages cutting-edge ML algorithms to quickly determine the resistance to LEV and CIP. The process began with the collection of a culture sample, which the AI-CDSS then analyzed to predict resistance patterns. For a clear understanding of our process, The flowchart inrepresents the systematic process behind the development of the AI-CDSS, which commenced with a comprehensive data collection phase, acquiring 165,299 bacterial specimens from January 2021 to December 2023. Post identification of Klebsiella pneumoniae within the samples, they were subjected to AST. Specimens yielding intermediate AST results were excluded, resulting in 11,127 for LEV and 11,623 for CIP resistance analyses, thus forming a training dataset. Subsequent data preprocessing involved meticulous feature extraction and log transformation of mass spectrometry data to eliminate noise and standardize the dataset. This dataset was then used to train robust ML models, such as Random Forest, LGBM, and XGBoost, to accurately predict antibiotic resistance. The AI-CDSS, by leveraging these models, facilitates rapid and precise predictions of LEV and CIP resistance, ultimately aiding health care professionals in informed clinical decision-making.\nEthical Considerations\nThis retrospective study adhered to the ethical standards outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and relevant local regulations for human subject protection. The institutional review board of Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, approved the research (TSGHIRB No. C202305073). Due to the study's retrospective design, the requirement for informed consent was waived. All analyzed data were anonymized to ensure patient confidentiality.\nResults\nML Model Development Using MS Data\nMS analyses revealed distinct spectral differences that differentiated antibiotic-resistant KP strains from their susceptible counterparts.shows the average intensity distributions across m/z segments for KP strains, with CIP resistance shown in blue and susceptibility in red. The top graph (A) highlights the m/z segments that differ between CIP-resistant and susceptible strains, whereas the bottom graph (B) depicts analogous distributions for LEV resistance. These graphs provide a stark visual comparison of the spectral differences, emphasizing the distinct spectral markers associated with antibiotic resistance that can be instrumental for rapid resistance detection.\nMS data for KP showed a consistent array of the top 15 spectral features in strains resistant to both CIP and LEV. These features span m/z ratio ranges of 2035-2040, 2067-2072, 2166-2171, 2180-2185, 2688-2695, 2759-2764, 3143-3152, 4363-4368, 4567-4572, 5278-5283, 5379-5384, 7238-7253, 7703-7708, 9136-9145, and 9532-9544. The shared features across CIP- and LEV-resistant strains suggest a universal mechanism of resistance despite the different modes of action of antibiotics.\nThis is graphically represented in the heat maps inA for ciprofloxacin and B for levofloxacin, where the correlation between each m/z ratio range and resistance status are color-coded for clarity. The intensity of the color correlates with the strength of the association; the redder the hue, the stronger the correlation with resistance. These heat maps provide a visual summary of the data, emphasizing the features most strongly associated with resistance, thus informing future molecular studies and aiding in the development of new approaches to combat antibiotic resistance. In , The top graph (A) shows the correlation between the top 15 m/z segments and CIP resistance, whereas the bottom graph (B) illustrates these correlations for LEV resistance. The heatmaps transition from blue to red, indicating an increasing strength of correlation from weaker to stronger, respectively. These patterns highlighted the top 15 differential m/z segments that were most indicative of antibiotic resistance.\nModel Performance Metrics, Validation Results, and ROC Curve Analyses\nTo assess the efficacy of ML models in predicting antibiotic resistance in KP, we evaluated several algorithms across 2 different drug resistances. The model performance metrics, including the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F1-score, are detailed inand for CIP and LEV resistance, respectively. For CIP resistance, the Random Forest demonstrated the highest testing AUC at 0.95, indicative of its robust predictive power, with Gradient Boosting Classifier and XGBoost also performing notably well with AUCs of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. These models are particularly useful in identifying CIP-resistant KP strains with high accuracy and precision.\n|Models||Training AUCa||Testing AUC||Accuracy||Sensitivity||Specificity||PPVb||NPVc||F1-score|\n|RFd||0.99||0.95||0.87||0.88||0.86||0.81||0.91||0.85|\n|LGBMe||0.99||0.95||0.90||0.88||0.91||0.87||0.92||0.88|\n|GBCf||0.99||0.95||0.87||0.92||0.84||0.80||0.93||0.86|\n|XGBoost||0.99||0.95||0.87||0.89||0.86||0.82||0.92||0.85|\n|AdaBoost||0.99||0.87||0.77||0.81||0.74||0.69||0.85||0.74|\n|LRg||0.91||0.84||0.78||0.77||0.78||0.71||0.83||0.74|\n|LDAh||0.96||0.80||0.77||0.80||0.75||0.69||0.84||0.74|\naAUC: area under the curve.\nbPPV: positive predictive value.\ncNPV: negative predictive value.\ndRF: random forest.\neLGBM: light gradient boosting machine.\nfGBC: gradient boosting classifier.\ngLR: logistic regression.\nhLDA: linear discriminant analysis.\n|Models||Training AUCa||Testing AUC||Accuracy||Sensitivity||Specificity||PPVb||NPVc||F1-score|\n|RFd||0.99||0.95||0.86||0.89||0.82||0.86||0.86||0.87|\n|GBCe||0.99||0.95||0.87||0.88||0.86||0.89||0.85||0.88|\n|XGBoost||0.99||0.93||0.85||0.86||0.85||0.87||0.83||0.86|\n|LGBMf||0.99||0.92||0.85||0.84||0.85||0.87||0.82||0.86|\n|AdaBoost||0.99||0.90||0.85||0.85||0.84||0.87||0.83||0.86|\n|LRg||0.77||0.73||0.66||0.74||0.57||0.68||0.64||0.70|\n|LDAh||0.72||0.68||0.64||0.81||0.43||0.63||0.65||0.71|\naAUC: area under the curve.\nbPPV: positive predictive value.\ncNPV: negative predictive value.\ndRF: random forest.\neGBC: gradient boosting classifier.\nfLGBM: light gradient boosting machine.\ngLR: logistic regression.\nhLDA: linear discriminant analysis.\nThe LEV resistance models displayed a similar trend, with the Random Forest classifier again showing exceptional performance, with an AUC of 0.95. The gradient boosting classifier and XGBoost showed similar effectiveness, with AUCs of 0.95 and 0.93. These algorithms proved effective in distinguishing LEV-resistant and LEV-susceptible strains with considerable accuracy. The ROC curves, as presented inA and B, visually encapsulate the model performance, with the Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting classifiers exhibiting steep ascents toward the upper left corner, denoting high true-positive rates and low false-positive rates. Although logistic regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis showed lower AUC values, their inclusion offered a broad perspective and contributed to the ensemble approach in model evaluation. In , the 2 charts display the performance of various ML models in classifying Klebsiella pneumoniae strains as resistant or susceptible to 2 antibiotics: CIP and LEV. The top panel (A) displays the ROC curves for models predicting CIP resistance, with the Random Forest classifier achieving an AUC of 0.95, indicating its excellent predictive ability. The bottom panel (B) displays the ROC curves for models predicting LEV resistance, where the random forest (RF) classifier also achieves a high AUC of 0.95, demonstrating consistently high performance across different antibiotic resistances. The curves plot each model's true positive rate (sensitivity) against its false positive rate (1-specificity), with the diagonal line representing a random chance. The closer a curve follows the left-hand border and then the top border of the ROC space, the more accurate the test.\nDespite their range of performance metrics, our ensemble of models collectively provided a robust method for assessing KP resistance to CIP and LEV. This comprehensive approach, which leverages the strengths of multiple predictive algorithms, offers valuable insights into antibiotic resistance patterns, aiding the development of precision treatment strategies using our AI-CDSS.\nIntegration of AI-CDSS in the Clinical Process\nThe integration of our AI-CDSS platform into the antibiotic resistance–testing workflow represents a significant advancement in the treatment of infectious diseases. This system streamlines the evaluation process from the initial culture of samples to the final decision-making in clinical settings. Using advanced ML algorithms, the platform rapidly predicts resistance to antibiotics, such as LEV and CIP, providing clinicians with precise and efficient analyses that inform treatment strategies. This is particularly critical for managing cases of KP, for which timely intervention is crucial. The platform’s predictive capabilities allow for resistance determination for approximately 3 days, a notable improvement over the conventional 4-day timeline required for standard AST. By accelerating the decision-making process, the AI-CDSS contributes to improved patient outcomes and enhances antibiotic stewardship efforts, ensuring that treatments are both appropriate and effective. The workflow diagram clearly contrasts the AI-CDSS with traditional AST methods, highlighting the reduction in time to clinical decisions and underscoring the benefits of real-time data in the management of infectious diseases.\nDiscussion\nPrincipal Findings\nThis investigation of the predictive capabilities of ML and MALDI-TOF MS for identifying quinolone-susceptible KP and quinolone-resistant KP signifies a groundbreaking development in the expedited diagnosis of infectious diseases. The synergy between MALDI-TOF MS and ML provides an innovative approach to detecting and managing antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This advancement is particularly relevant for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the WHO has noted a rapid escalation in antibiotic use, presenting challenges to access and stewardship [, ]. Our findings are of significant value in LMICs, as they propose a strategic balance between antibiotic availability and stewardship, which could influence policy adaptations aimed at fulfilling WHO objectives and strengthening global health security against antimicrobial resistance.\nThe increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, notably in quinolone-resistant KP strains, necessitates novel diagnostic methods [- ]. Traditional methods fail to swiftly identify these bacteria, thereby prolonging the initiation of suitable treatments and containment actions [ ]. Previous research on ML with MALDI-TOF for discerning quinolone-resistant KP has used a modest number of isolates. Our study compiles an unprecedentedly large dataset for a ML model to detect quinolone-resistant KP, demonstrating the potential of advanced technologies in predicting resistance with high precision, thereby expediting accurate diagnoses and enabling effective treatments. The incorporation of algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost has shown high efficacy in differentiating between resistant and susceptible KP strains, playing a pivotal role in informed antibiotic selection and combating the spread of resistance.\nComparative Advantages of MALDI-TOF MS and Next-Generation Sequencing in Clinical Settings\nIn clinical practice, KP was identified using MALDI-TOF MS and subsequently tested for antibiotic susceptibility with the VITEK 2 system. In our study, we used artificial intelligence to analyze MALDI-TOF MS spectra and predict KP as resistant or susceptible phenotypes. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) is commonly used for genotype analysis in other studies, genotypic data may not always align with phenotypic expressions. Antibiotic resistance typically develops through genetic alterations, either by the acquisition of resistance genes or mutations in elements crucial for antibiotic activity. However, resistance can also occur without any genetic changes, a phenomenon known as phenotypic resistance illustrating the challenges of predicting antibiotic resistance based solely on genetic information [- ]. Discrepancies may arise from pseudogenes in low antibiotic environments, where nonlethal mutations persist in contrast to the rapid elimination of ineffective genes in high antibiotic environments [ ]. In addition, gene interactions, regulatory mechanisms, and expression levels significantly impact resistance gene functionality [ - ]. Our study emphasizes the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to quickly provide crucial, actionable resistance profiles for urgent clinical decisions [ , ]. NGS can provide a detailed analysis of resistance genes; however, its longer processing times limit its use in emergencies [ - ]. In contrast, MALDI-TOF MS can detect these mechanisms through its protein expression analysis, proving invaluable in clinical settings that require rapid decision-making [ , ].\nSpeeding Up Pathogen Diagnostics With AI and MALDI-TOF MS\nOur integration of AI-CDSS with MALDI-TOF MS technology offers a significant improvement in diagnostic speed and efficiency that answers the need for rapid diagnostics for infectious diseases, particularly those involving drug-resistant pathogens such as KP. Our approach reduces the time needed to determine antibiotic resistance to approximately 72 hours from the initial culture. Traditional culturing methods, while reliable, require up to 96 hours—72 hours for culturing and identification and an additional 24 hours for AST interpretation, potentially delaying critical treatment decisions [, ]. In comparison, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing methods still require 72 hours for the initial pathogen identification by MALDI-TOF MS, followed by 1-2 days for PCR and 3-4 days for sequencing, depending on the complexity of the analysis [ , , , ]. Comparisons of the timelines for each method were provided in . Therefore, our study demonstrates that the integration of AI-CDSS with MALDI-TOF MS not only significantly speeds up the diagnostic process but also improves the timeliness of clinical responses, crucial for managing severe infections.\nImpact and Future Directions\nIn addition to the advancements detailed above, the integration of an AI-CDSS is a groundbreaking enhancement of our diagnostic capabilities. The AI-CDSS, which leverages the predictive power of ML models, offers clinicians real-time, data-driven insights, significantly improving the decision-making process in the treatment of infections caused by LEV- and CIP-resistant KP. This system can rapidly interpret complex diagnostic data, recommend personalized treatment options, and predict potential resistance patterns, thereby streamlining the diagnostic workflow and facilitating a more targeted approach to antibiotic therapy. The introduction of AI-CDSS into our methodology underscores our commitment to harness cutting-edge technology to combat antibiotic resistance, representing a vital step forward in the optimization of clinical outcomes and advancement of antibiotic stewardship.\nLimitations\nThis study underscores the intricacies involved in dataset balancing and the pivotal role of feature selection within the domain of ML algorithms. A comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the subsequent training of models delineates the multifaceted nature of constructing dependable predictive frameworks. In addition, intermediate results often present challenges in predictive models due to the uncertainty they introduce, which can potentially skew the model’s outcomes. Consequently, the exclusion of specimens with intermediate AST results (869 for LEV and 373 for CIP) allowed for a more focused study but potentially omitted significant data, affecting model generalizability for these intermediate cases. Future research should focus on enhancing these models by incorporating intermediate cases, as well as diverse data modalities, to broaden their applicability and encompass a wider array of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Furthermore, the significance of this investigation transcends the boundaries of immediate clinical use and serves as a cornerstone for informing public health policies and shaping infection control methodologies. This study makes a substantial contribution to international efforts aimed at combating antimicrobial resistance by providing a swift, precise, and economically viable mechanism to identify antibiotic resistance. This issue remains a global public health priority and requires continued attention and action.\nComparison With Previous Work\nPrevious studies used conventional PCR-based methods to identify quinolone resistance genes among KP clinical isolates [, ]. ML techniques combined with MALDI-TOF of discrimination of carbapenem-resistant KP with limited sample isolates [ , ]. To date, there are no studies discussing the use of ML combined with MALDI-TOF for the rapid identification of quinolone resistance in KP. Our research establishes the most extensive collection of isolates to date for constructing a ML model aimed at identifying LEV and CIP resistance. The methodological innovation of this study, through the analysis of approximately 12,000 KP cultures, demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy of using advanced technologies to predict resistance patterns. This approach not only enhances the precision of diagnostics but also significantly reduces the time required to identify resistant strains, facilitating timely and targeted therapeutic interventions.\nConclusions\nMALDI-TOF MS is a swift, accurate, and cost-efficient method for identifying bacteria, including its application in the detection of antibiotic resistance. This study highlights the successful AI-CDSS with the application of a ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF approach for predicting quinolone-resistant KP. However, certain constraints exist, particularly when resistance mechanisms are not mediated at the protein-peptide level or fall outside the m/z ratio range of 2000-20,000. Future studies are required to validate the results further.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Editage for its English language editing service.\nThe grants awarded by the hospital (grant numbers TSGH-D-113105 and TSGH-D-113106) were pivotal in facilitating our research.\nData Availability\nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nAuthors' Contributions\nM-JJ contributed to the conceptualization, formal analysis, investigation, data curation, and writing of the original draft.

( [WMBB](https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/walton-county/more-than-4k-raised-in-ribbons-for-lulu-fundraiser/)) – A fundraiser for one of the June 7 shark bite victims is really taking off. Last week, we told you about the ribbons for Lulu’s campaign. Jane Denton with Beachy Blooms 30-A is selling big purple bows for $20. The money goes to 15-year-old Lulu Gribbin, who lost a hand and a leg in the June 7 attack. The florist and avid bow maker said her goal was to make the community shine purple which is Lulu’s favorite color. In just 10 days, Denton received more than 200 orders, totaling $4,000. “I was at Peddlers Pavilion yesterday and they have big, shiny purple ribbons up all over and it just warms my heart makes me feel really good. And I know the community also feels really good that we’re doing something to help Lulu,” Beachy Blooms 30-A, Jane Denton said. There are five pick-up locations also selling ribbons. For the list of those locations, [click here.](https://www.facebook.com/beachyblooms30a) There is an online fundraiser for attack survivor Elizabeth Foley. It’s raised more than $95,000.",

    "text": "[NPC1](/user/NPC1)a [lavanguardia.com](/go/link/3974042)\n¿Como de subnormal hay que ser para pagar por mostrar a una ciudad de un millón de habitantes lo subnormal que eres?\n[#49](c49#c-49) Somos el parque de atracciones de Europa porque queremos ser el parque de atracciones de Europa.\n[#66](c66#c-66) Somos el país barato de la fiesta, también tienes el de el arte (Roma-Italia) y el de la historia (Atenas-Grecia).\nLos turistas pasan por lo menos una vez por la segunda y tercera pero seguramente repitan en la primera.\n[#33](c33#c-33) tienes razón, que los metan en algún sitio sin señores mayores, en una guardería encajarían perfectamente\n[#33](c33#c-33) Pero tú has visto los vídeos? https://www.bailaloloco.com/\nVergüenza ajena...\nPor otro lado no debe ser nada agradable vivir en el centro e ir (por ejemplo) con la compra y encontrarte a estos monguers en medio de la calle. Con este tipo de actividades expulsan a la gente normal del centro de las ciudades.\n[#33](c33#c-33) si es una persona , o dos vale, pero si van ocupando todo el ancho de la calle, co un ritmo impredecible (es decir moviéndoselo de un lado a otro, no con un andar normal) pues empieza a tocas las pelotas\nyo prefiero esto\n[#45](c45#c-45) claro, claro. Seguro que al vecino le encanta que cada hora pasen varios grupos grandes de gente con auriculares bailando sin enterarse de lo que pasa a su alrededor y cantando o moviéndose y ocupando toda la calle.\nSeguramente los dos primeros días fue gracioso.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Depende de cuantos sean y por dónde pasen, supongo. Si se meten en medio de la plaza de la reina o delante del palau de la música y son 25 personas caben tranquilamente, pero si se meten esos mismos 25 en una acera de 3 metros como se ve en la captura... pues joden 15m de acera \"a su ritmo\" por la puta cara.\nHace años ya se liaron pollos con los segway, porque ni contaminan ni hacen ruido, pero cuando van unos cuantos juntos colapsan calles y cruces.\n[#21](c21#c-21) eso me pasa a mí, vivo al lado del centro de mi ciudad, y ocupan y se paran en sitios estrechos, cuando no te ves al grupo entero ocupando todo el carril bici\n[#4](c4#c-4) a mí esto me suena a felicidad impostada. A Mr Wonderfull, a querer tapar una fuga de agua con buenas intenciones, a Teletubbies modernos. Pero que sabré yo que soy un triste\n[#4](c4#c-4) Eso digo yo, otra cosa sería que lo hicieran con música en altavoces. Si a la gente no le importa hacer el ridículo, y se lo pasan bien así, por mi perfecto.\n[#14](c14#c-14) porque seguramente moleste al resto, tu ves un grupo de flipados bailando, te mererias en su camino? pasarias entre ellos? le dejarías paso a todos priorizandolos?\nTampoco hay que pensar mucho para darse cuenta que es una molestia\n[#4](c4#c-4) Pues sí. Esa parece la moda, criticar a una de las actividades que más ingresos generan en este país. Otra cosa que sí es criticable es la actitud de la gente, la mala educación, etc. Pero eso desgraciadamente lo padecemos a diario en todos los ámbitos, en el trabajo, en la calle, en el supermercado, etc. No es exclusivo del turismo. Pero vamos, que si tan malo es puede que tengamos que reorientar la producción hacia el sector primario.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Actividad económica que genera beneficios para pocos y molestias para muchos, atrae trabajadores con sueldos míseros y provoca un encarecimiento sin precedentes de los alquileres. Dear tourist enjoy balconing.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Mucho amargado que no tiene un duro para irse de vacaciones y en vez de cagarse en la madre que pario a su empresa que le paga una mierda, se desahoga odiando turistas\n[#4](c4#c-4) Estoy de acuerdo pero... No es lo mismo una persona con auriculares bailando por la calle que un grupo de diez o veinte, con \"coreografías\" y ocupando todo el espacio. Sin ver ningún vídeo es difícil opinar, pero por lo leído tiene que ser un poquito incordiante.\n[#4](c4#c-4) No es quejarse por quejarse, mucha gente si, pero otros no tanto.\nVivo en mallorca y mi ingresos vienen gracias al turismo.\nAún así, hay que reconocer que no todo vale. Ya que hay actividades que pueden ser muy guays para los turistas pero realmente molestas para la gente que vive en la zona.\nPor ejemplo, aquí se han limitado los tours de buggies y motos de agua. Debido a que hacen un tour cada hora durante 8 horas por los mismos caminos y calas. Para la gente que vive en las zonas de paso es insoportable.\nY volviendo a la noticia, realmente es muy molesto los grupos de turistas. Como cruceristas, estos bailando, etc, debido a que no es lo mismo 50 turistas paseando a su bola que 50 turistas haciendo lo mismo, los segundos bloquean por completo.\nY el problema no es que haya 1 grupo, es que hay 3-4 grupos cada hora.\nLas críticas que yo defiendo son contra la masificación, no se puede todo para todos.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Quejarse del turismo puede tener sentido, porque en muchos sitios es excesivo. Pero no habría que quejarse al turista, que poca o ninguna culpa tiene, sino más bien a los que se están lucrando con los alquileres turísticos (y de paso, dificultando el acceso a la vivienda) y a los gobiernos que lo permiten. Quita eso, y en muchos sitios la cantidad de turistas ya volvería a ser aceptable. Para el resto, tasas turísticas hasta obtener un influjo razonable.\nPero claro, siempre es más fácil echar la culpa al débil.\n[#22](c22#c-22) Y aún así es un problema mental mucho menor del que se pone a correr por la calle delante de un toro.\n[#25](c25#c-25) En el Retiro hay muchos, además de estos, haciendo flashmobing, k-pop, influencers y demás. Un par de broncas he tenido por pasar por donde están haciendo sus movidas, pero me la suda. Me empiezo a parecer al señor que se sienta en el banco del parque detrás de la streamer: \"Your followers? Oh, are you Jesus now? are you?\"\nHay que ser imbécil o tener un problema mental para que te moleste que haya gente bailando sin hacer ruido.\nEnésimo artículo de mierda sobre el tema cansino del verano para que la gente haga el clic correspondiente y el periódico gane dinerito, que está la cosa mu achuchá.\nA ver, si no molestan con auriculares no me parece mal. Que los frivolos guiris se diviertan como quieran.",
