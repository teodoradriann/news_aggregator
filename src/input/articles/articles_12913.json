    "text": "A Qatar court has dropped the death sentence for eight Indian ex-navy personnel arrested in the country last year, India's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.\nThe eight men were handed the death penalty in October.\nIndian media reported that the eight Indian nationals , among them former high-ranking and decorated officers, including captains who once commanded warships, were arrested in Doha in August 2022.\nThe eight men are Capt Navtej Singh Gill, Capt Saurabh Vasisht, Capt Birendra Kumar Verma, Cmdr Purenendu Tiwari, Cmdr Sanjeev Gupta, Cmdr Sugunakar Pakala, Cmdr Amit Nagpal and sailor Ragesh Gopakumar. All of them served at least 20 years with India's navy .\nREAD MORE Qatar court to hear death sentence appeal of Indian former naval officers “The detailed judgment is awaited. We are in close touch with the legal team as well as the family members to decide on the next steps,” the Indian Foreign Ministry said.\n“Our Ambassador to Qatar and other officials were present in the Court of Appeal today, along with the family members,” it added.\n“Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of proceedings of this case, it would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this juncture,“ India’s Foreign Ministry said.\nThe men had worked in Doha for Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services, an Oman-based private company that provided training and related services to Qatar's armed forces.\nThe specific charges against the men have not yet been made public by either country. Media reports have said they were accused of spying on behalf of Israel .\nThe men were reportedly working on a project to build midget submarines with stealth capabilities.\nThe owner of the company was also arrested, but was reportedly released in November last year.\nThe case has raised potential issues for India-Qatar relations.\nMore than 800,000 Indian citizens live in Qatar, which has a total population of around 2.7 million people.\nIndia's bilateral trade with Qatar in the financial year ending March 2022 was $16.8 billion, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs.\nUpdated: December 29, 2023, 12:38 PM",

    "text": "In Depth: China’s Self-Driving Tech-Makers Downshift\n[Subscribe now](https://pay.caixinglobal.com/mall/index.html)\nListen to the full version\nThere was a time when venture capitalists (VCs) preferred investing in Chinese companies working on fully self-driving vehicles, with the goal of building globally recognized Chinese brands in the smart car space.\nSince the middle of 2022, however, VCs have become more cautious about putting money into these companies as advanced self-driving technology has yet to overcome some substantial hurdles in commercialization. Under the circumstances, many developers of self-driving car tech have switched to developing less advanced assisted driving systems for automakers to maintain cash flow, which is crucial to attracting investor interest.\n[Download](https://www.caixinglobal.com/app/?utm_source=articlebottom&utm_medium=appdw&utm_campaign=globalarticle) our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.\n[Get](https://www.caixinglobal.com/newsletter/?internalReferrer=article_end_newsletter_ad) our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.\n- DIGEST HUB\n- Venture capitalists have shifted focus from fully self-driving to less advanced driver assistance systems due to commercialization challenges. Developers now target Level 2 systems, with 55.7% of new passenger vehicles in 2024 equipped with them.\n- Horizon Robotics, Zhuoyu, and Momenta are key Chinese players focusing on driver assistance technologies. Horizon Robotics ranks fourth in global ADAS systems, working on advanced systems with partners like Qcraft and PhiGent Robotics.\n- WeRide and Pony AI, key players in the robotaxi space, struggle with profitability despite securing Nasdaq listings. They pursue Middle Eastern markets amid domestic financial challenges, aiming for operational breakeven and long-term commercialization.\n[para. 1] Initially, venture capitalists (VCs) were eager to invest in Chinese companies developing fully autonomous vehicles, aspiring to establish internationally recognized Chinese brands in smart car technology. However, since mid-2022, their enthusiasm has waned due to significant challenges hindering advanced self-driving technology's commercialization. To navigate this, many developers have pivoted towards creating less advanced assisted driving systems for automakers to sustain cash flow, thus maintaining investor interest.\n[para. 3] This shift is timely, as the market for vehicles equipped with Level 2 and Level 2+ assisted driving systems is anticipated to grow. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology data reveals that 55.7% of new passenger vehicles sold in the first half of 2024 included Level 2 systems, with 11% featuring Level 2+ systems. Meanwhile, SAE International classifies autonomous driving from Level 0 to Level 5. Level 2+ technology is an enhanced version of Level 2, incorporating navigation-assisted features beyond basic functionalities like adaptive cruise control.\n[para. 5] However, Chinese self-driving companies struggle to capture more market share from dominant foreign players such as Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH and Israel’s Mobileye Global Inc. Also, a domestic price war among car manufacturers pushes them towards cheaper systems, squeezing profitability for developers. As a result, some are exploring markets beyond passenger vehicles, like urban delivery, mining, and port operations, as these sectors present less complex challenges.\n[para. 8] Companies like Horizon Robotics Inc., SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd.-affiliated SZ Zhuoyu Technology Co. Ltd., and Momenta.ai are leading in China's development of driver assistance systems. Horizon Robotics focuses on Level 2 systems but offers advanced solutions like the Horizon Mono and Horizon Pilot for diverse driving conditions. By the end of 2023, their technologies were incorporated into multiple car models, highlighting their market influence.\n[para. 11] On the other hand, Zhuoyu, established in 2016 as DJI’s smart driving system unit, designs and manufactures major components in-house, reducing product costs. Zhuoyu signed significant deals to equip over 20 car models with its systems in 2024. They plan mass production of an integrated sensor system for higher-priced cars in 2026.\n[para. 15] Meanwhile, Momenta has transitioned to developing lower-tier assistance systems, targeting both high-end and budget markets. Their partnership with Qualcomm Technologies Inc. to launch a cost-effective smart driving system for mainstream cars exemplifies this strategy. They also took steps to design their own chips, indicative of a move towards self-sufficiency and cost reduction.\n[para. 20] In robotaxi endeavors, companies like WeRide Inc. and Pony AI Inc. went public on the Nasdaq in late 2023. Despite securing funding, they face difficulties in turning robotaxis profitable. Most revenue comes from less complicated autonomous truck services, with robotaxi services yet to break even. Investors remain interested in driverless taxis for their potential efficiency gains, though profitability challenges persist.\n[para. 25] Both WeRide and Pony AI are exploring international expansions, eyeing markets like the Middle East, where countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia have outlined ambitious plans for autonomous vehicle integration by 2030. [para. 26] With new strategic partnerships and investments, such as Pony AI’s collaboration with Saudi Arabia’s Neom urban project, these companies aim to establish a foothold in these emerging markets, signaling opportunities for growth despite domestic challenges.\n- Horizon Robotics Inc.\n- Horizon Robotics Inc., founded in 2015, specializes in AI-driven assisted and smart driving systems.

    "text": "China's eastern coastal province of Zhejiang has been battered by strong winds and torrential rains as Typhoon Kong-rey is approaching. Typhoon Kong-rey, the 21st typhoon of the year, made landfall on the Taiwan region's Taitung coast at around 14:00 on Thursday before moving across the island and gradually shifting northeast toward the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts. The eastern and northern parts of Zhejiang have experienced a wide range of heavy rainfall starting from Thursday night, with strong rainstorms sweeping Wenzhou, Taizhou and Ningbo cities. The footage filmed on Friday morning showed that the gales and downpours brought by Kong-rey were continuing in some areas of Zhejiang. According to the meteorological authorities, Kong-rey is currently a tropical storm with a wind speed of 75 to 88 kilometers per hour. The typhoon is expected to move to the east-north direction at a speed of about 25 kilometers per hour, with little change in intensity, before making a landfall or sideswipe on the coast from Wenzhou to Taizhou before turning northeast. In the affected areas of Zhejiang, the waterborne projects under construction have been suspended, the seaside scenic spots have been closed, and marine workers have been relocated to safe places. Local emergency rescue and repair crews have been mobilized and on standby, while disaster relief supplies have been prepared.",

    "title": "Mais energia e imunidade? O poder da Vitamina D com Magn\\u00e9sio",
    "text": "O debate sobre a combinação de magnésio e vitamina D na suplementação tem ganhado destaque nos últimos anos. Essa associação é considerada por alguns especialistas como benéfica para a saúde geral. Para compreender melhor essa relação, é essencial examinar os papéis individuais desses nutrientes e como eles interagem no organismo. Função do Magnésio no Corpo Humano O magnésio é um mineral vital que participa de mais de 300 reações bioquímicas no corpo humano. Ele contribui para funções como a produção de energia, a síntese de proteínas, a regulação do açúcar no sangue e o equilíbrio da pressão arterial. Adicionalmente, o magnésio é crucial para a manutenção da saúde óssea e a correta transmissão de sinais nervosos. O Papel da Vitamina D Vitamina D é essencial para a absorção e manutenção de cálcio e fósforo no organismo, desempenhando um papel fundamental na saúde óssea e dentária. Além disso, essa vitamina é conhecida por fortalecer o sistema imunológico, reduzir a inflamação e, potencialmente, influenciar funções neuromusculares e cerebrais. A Interação entre Magnésio e Vitamina D Magnésio e vitamina D atuam de maneira sinérgica no corpo. O magnésio é necessário para a ativação da vitamina D, uma função que é crítica para o desempenho eficaz dos benefícios dessa vitamina. Sem quantidades adequadas de magnésio, a vitamina D pode não ser metabolizada de forma eficaz, limitando seus efeitos positivos sobre a saúde. - O magnésio auxilia na conversão da vitamina D em sua forma ativa no fígado e nos rins. - Pessoas com baixos níveis de magnésio podem apresentar dificuldades na metabolização da vitamina D, levando à ineficiência no uso desta vitamina pelo corpo. - Estudos indicam que a deficiência de magnésio pode estar associada a níveis insuficientes de vitamina D no organismo. Considerações para a Suplementação Conforme relatado por fontes como o [ Instituto Nacional de Saúde, ](https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br)a suplementação desses nutrientes pode ser benéfica em certos casos, especialmente para indivíduos com deficiência diagnosticada.
