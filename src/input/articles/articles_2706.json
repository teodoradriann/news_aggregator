    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, UT (KSTU) — Prison can be a dark, cold and lonely place. It’s a place most people want to avoid. But for more than 30 years, Robert Aguilar walked through the gates of the Utah State Prison willingly in an effort to deliver hope. “God has listened and heard my voice in prayer,” Aguilar reads from scripture. The tools of the trade are simple. A kind voice, an open heart, and a Bible. “There is a dark area of the prison system, and some get tired of it,” Aguilar said. “They want to change and that means it's from the heart.” Aguilar began taking his Bible to the Utah State Prison in 1983. It was a way for him to turn his life around. “I had a sense of worthlessness because of the life I had been leading previously,” Aguilar said. “I was a heavy drinker. My wife mentioned that she was going to leave me.” Faith, Aguilar says, changed his life. “I felt like I had something more. We all have something in our lives that calls to that. There is something more important that we can do than just living.” It was that faith that led Aguilar to devote his Sunday mornings as a christian minister — volunteering with prisoners willing to listen. “When I walk in, they call me ‘Pastor Bob,’ they all know me as Pastor Bob here. Bryan Taylor is a deputy warden for the prison who oversees volunteers. “I actually reached out and talked to some of the inmates out of the prison and they just love him,” Taylor said. The deputy warden says the service provided by Aguilar and prison volunteers is life changing. “Individuals when they are locked away and they are contemplating their life – having someone to talk to – that one-on-one communication face-to-face cannot be replicated by anything else than doing it,” Taylor said. Now 88 years old, Aguilar likes to be with his family, work in his garden, or enjoy a meal at Ogies, his favorite restaurant in West Valley City. It’s a place where he’s reconnected with some former prisoners. “I had fellows come in and they tapped me on the back, and they say ‘Pastor Bob, you don't know me, I was in your services, and I took on what you told me, what was in scripture that my life could be changed. My life has changed I go to church, and I am a happy man and I want to thank you for what you did.’” Those moments bring Aguilar joy, knowing his change for the good has helped others find a similar path and bring good to the world. “Praise be to God who has not rejected my prayer or has not held his love from me.” Aguilar says he would have liked to keep going, but the walk in the new prison parking lot is just too much compared to the old facility. He estimates the walk is about a quarter of a mile and he’s afraid he’d fall down and hurt himself. Still though, prisoners call him on the phone to maintain communication.",

    "text": "O P I N I O N It’s that time of the year when we recognize and remember those we’ve lost this past year. All of the news organizations will again pay tribute to individuals we’re all familiar with like Norman Lear, 101; Henry Kissinger, 110; Rosalynn Carter, 96; Matthew Perry, 54; Dianne Feinstein, 90; Bob Barker, 99; Paul Reubens, 70; Tony Bennett, 96; and Alan Arkin, 89. Some of those who have passed this year may not be familiar to everyone, but they may have been important to us as we matured. To those, I give special thanks for what they contributed to my own experiences. [Denny Laine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Laine), 76, December 5. Laine was a founding member of The Moody Blues, 1964-1966, singing their hit cover version of “Go Now.” According to legend, while the Moody Blues were on tour with [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles)in 1965, Laine met [Paul McCartney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney), who later asked him to join his band Wings. Laine played guitar, bass, and keyboards, and sang backup and lead vocals with Wings during its entire run, 1971 to 1981. He also co-wrote songs with McCartney including the 1977 hit “ [Mull of Kintyre.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mull_of_Kintyre_(song))” The Moody Blues and Wings are on my own favorite rock groups list. - Suzanne Somers, 76, October 15. Somers was perhaps best known for what was termed “T and A” television as Chrissy Snow in Three’s Company, 1977-1981, and pitching the ThighMaster. She was also a breast cancer advocate and health and wellness businessperson and she wrote more than 25 books, including two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Who knew? - Having lived in Boston for more than 40 years, how could I not remember Red Sox Tim Wakefield (57, October 1), our [knuckleball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckleball) [legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher)? Although he began his MLB career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, he will always be most remembered for his 17 years with the [Red Sox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox). Wakefield was the longest-playing player on the team (1995-2015). When he retired at age 45 after 19 seasons in MLB, Wakefield was the oldest active player in the major leagues. - David McCallum, 90, September 25. Do you remember watching [The Man from U.N.C.L.E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E.). as a kid? In the ’60s, secret agents were all the craze and we couldn’t get enough of them. I, like so many, preferred agent [Illya Kuryakin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illya_Kuryakin)over the suave Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn). While playing Kuryakin, McCallum received more fan mail than any other actor in [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer)‘s history. In 2003 McCallum again reinvented his popularity playing Medical Examiner [Dr. Donald “Ducky” Mallard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCIS_characters#Dr._Donald_.22Ducky.22_Mallard) in the television series [NCIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)) for 20 seasons until his death. Twenty years. Who knew? - Terry Kirkman, 83, September 24. You may not know his name, but you have to know the song he wrote, “ [Cherish,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherish_(The_Association_song))” as a member of [The Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Association)that has been played at innumerable wedding ceremonies. According to [BMI](https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/19991214_bmi_announces_top_100_songs_of_the_century)(Broadcast Music, Inc.), “Cherish” was the 22nd most-played song of the 20th Century. Was “Cherish” played at your wedding? - When you hear the name Gary Wright, (80, September 4), don’t you automatically start singing the song “ [Dream Weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Weaver)“? Okay, maybe you don’t. But perhaps you recall his 1976 hit “ [Love Is Alive.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is_Alive_(Gary_Wright_song)). Prior to “Dream Weaver,” Wright spent seven years as a member of the British band [Spooky Tooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spooky_Tooth)and as a solo artist. While in England, he played keyboards on former [Beatle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) [George Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison)‘s triple album [All Things Must Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Must_Pass)(1970). - Randy Meisner, 77, July 27, founding member of the ’70s rock band the [Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)). Meisner was a [bassist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassist)and a high-harmony vocalist as an Eagles group member and session musician. He co-wrote and sang the lead vocal on the Eagles hit song “ [Take It to the Limit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_It_to_the_Limit_(Eagles_song))” I can hear you start humming now. - Perhaps the best-known of this group is Jimmy Buffett, 76, who died September 1. Buffett, himself, called his [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Buffett#cite_note-13)“drunken Caribbean rock ‘n’ roll.” “It’s pure escapism is all it is…I’m not the first one to do it, nor shall I probably be the last. But I think it’s a part of the human condition that you’ve got to have some fun. You’ve got to get away from whatever you do to make a living or other parts of life that stress you out. I try to make it at least 50/50 fun to work and so far it’s worked out.” —Jimmy Buffett Buffett recorded many hit songs known as “ [The Big 8,](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-09-02/12-essential-jimmy-buffett-songs)” including “ [Margaritaville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaritaville)” (1977), ranked 234th on the Recording Industry Association of America‘s list of “ [Songs of the Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_the_Century)“; “ [Come Monday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Monday)” (1974); “ [Fins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fins_(song))” (1979); “ [Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_(Jimmy_Buffett_song))” (1979); “ [A Pirate Looks at Forty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pirate_Looks_at_Forty)” (1974); “ [Cheeseburger in Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeseburger_in_Paradise)” (1978); “ [Why Don’t We Get Drunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Don%27t_We_Get_Drunk)” (1973); and “ [Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changes_in_Latitudes,_Changes_in_Attitudes_(song))” (1977). He also performed “ [It’s Five O’Clock Somewhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Five_O%27Clock_Somewhere)” with [Alan Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Jackson) (2003). Although he only had one Top 10 song, 1977’s “Margaritaville” became his [signature](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/02/entertainment/jimmy-buffett-death/index.html). The chorus has been part of countless singalongs (Come on, now, sing along): “Wasted away again in Margaritaville, searching for my lost shaker of salt… Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame, but I know, it’s my own damn fault.” As one of the world’s richest musicians, Buffett had a [net worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth) of $1 billion and he was a bestselling author. You can bump into many of his fans, or “ [Parrotheads,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Buffett#cite_note-state-21)” at Latitude Margaritaville, his three retirement communities located in Daytona Beach and Watersound, Florida, and Hilton Head, South Carolina. You may also be familiar with his other business ventures, including [Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Buffett%27s_Margaritaville) restaurant chain, the now-defunct [Cheeseburger in Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeseburger_in_Paradise_(restaurant)) restaurant chain, and enterprises in hotels, casinos, and liquor. With the end of 2023, let’s raise a glass and toast these individuals and others we lost who were so meaningful to us. Cheers.",

    "title": "Mayawati welcomes Delhi University VC's decision to reject 'Manusmriti' readings as part of Law Faculty syllabus - The Economic Times",
    "text": "NEW DELHI: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) National President and the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati on Friday welcomed the decision of the Delhi University Vice Chancellor to reject a proposal to include 'Manusmriti' in the syllabus of its Law Faculty stating that strong opposition was natural and the decision to cancel this proposal was a welcome step. Strong opposition to the proposal to teach Manusmriti in the Law Department of Delhi University, which goes against the honour and dignity of the Indian Constitution and its egalitarian and welfare objectives, is natural and the decision to cancel this proposal is a welcome step, she said in a post on social media platform X.She further stated that the Manusmriti doesn't match the principles on which Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar composed the Indian Constitution and such attempts to include the Manusmriti in the curriculum were not appropriate. His Holiness Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar composed the universally accepted Indian Constitution, especially keeping the self-respect of the neglected people and women as well as humanism and secularism at the core, which does not match with Manusmriti at all. Therefore, any such attempt is not appropriate at all, Mayawati further stated.On Thursday, Delhi University Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Yogesh Singh, announced that the proposal to include the Sanskrit text 'Manusmriti' or Laws of Manu, which belongs to the Dharmastra literary tradition of Hinduism, in the LLB curriculum was rejected. Yesterday, some information came to us that Manusmriti will be part of the Law Faculty course (in DU). I inquired and talked to the Delhi University Vice Chancellor. He assured me that some law faculty members have proposed some changes in the jurisprudence chapter. But when the proposal came to the Delhi University administration, today there is an Academic Council meeting. There is no endorsement of any such proposal by the authentic body of the Academic Council. Yesterday itself, the Vice Chancellor rejected that proposal. We are all committed to our Constitution and to a futuristic approach. The government is committed to upholding the true spirit and letter of the Constitution. There is no question of including any controversial portion of any script, said Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.",
