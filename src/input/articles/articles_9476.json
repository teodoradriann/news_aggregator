Photo : Ernest Ferraro/X La rapide réaction à l’accident du bus scolaire qui a eu lieu vendredi dans la région de Cariboo, en Colombie-Britannique, a été essentielle pour assurer la sécurité des personnes impliquées, selon le chef des pompiers qui se trouvait sur les lieux. Nous sommes extrêmement fiers des pompiers volontaires et pompiers qui y ont participé, ainsi que nos partenaires , dit Roger Hollander, le chef des pompiers du District régional de Cariboo. Il ajoute que près de 40 enfants et quatre adultes ont pu être extirpés du véhicule. Certains élèves ont pu s’extraire eux-mêmes, explique le chef des pompiers, ajoutant qu'à l'arrivée des secours seuls le chauffeur et un élève étaient encore coincés à l’intérieur. L'intervention coordonnée de la GRC et des pompiers volontaires, a permis de secourir les deux personnes, dit-il. Un des élèves qui a été héliporté à l’hôpital est l’enfant d’un des pompiers. Ce pompier volontaire a dû faire preuve d’un grand contrôle, tant émotionnel que physique, pour pouvoir se concentrer et aider les autres enfants. [L’accident](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2082617/accident-autocar-lac-hache-mort) a fait 36 blessés, 14 d’entre eux ont dû être transportés à l’hôpital, par la route ou par les airs.",

    "title": "Steve Bannon must surrender to prison to start contempt sentence, judge says",
    "text": "Steve Bannon, a long-time ally of former President Donald Trump, must report to prison by July 1 to serve his four-month sentence for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the US Capitol insurrection, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.\nUS District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington granted the Justice Department’s request to make Mr Bannon begin his prison term after a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court last month upheld his contempt of Congress conviction.\nBannon is expected to seek a stay of the judge’s order, which could delay his surrender date. He told reporters outside court: “I’ve got great lawyers, and we’re going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.”\nMr Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Mr Trump, a Republican, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction.\nBut prosecutors urged the judge to revoke his bond after a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit said all of Bannon’s challenges lack merit.\nProsecutor John Crabb told the judge it was “very unlikely” that the full appeals court or the Supreme Court would throw out Bannon’s conviction.\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the January 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Mr Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\nBannon’s lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser did not ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\nThe defence has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a lawyer for Mr Trump to be in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Mr Trump has asserted executive privilege.\nDefence lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before he exhausts his appeals.\nHe said the case raises “serious constitutional issues” that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n“In this country, we don’t send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,” Mr Schoen told reporters.\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\nNavarro, too, had maintained that he couldn’t co-operate with the committee because Mr Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn’t prove Trump had actually invoked it.\nThe House January 6 committee’s final report asserted that Mr Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.",

The parkway reopened on Friday from milepost 0 to milepost 198 in Virginia, the National Park Service said in a news release. The entire parkway had been closed because of damage from [Helene](/article/comparing-storm-surge-tracks-of-hurricanes-milton-and-helene/62566605), which at last count on Friday had taken 238 lives and caused tremendous damage in the Southeast. The reopening includes 198 miles of the scenic byway from Shenandoah National Park south to Virginia Route 685 - Skyview Drive/Turkey Ridge Road, near the town of Fancy Gap, the Thursday news release said. Related video above: An autumn leaf-peeping map The NPS aims to reopen the rest of the parkway in Virginia within two weeks, the release said. All of the parkway in North Carolina, which was harder hit by Helene, remains closed. \"Due to the hard work of the Blue Ridge Parkway crews, we are able to open nearly 200 miles of the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia, a vital and scenic route that both embodies the natural beauty and cultural heritage of our region,\" Tracy Swartout, superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway, said in the release. \"While we celebrate this achievement, we also recognize that significant and, in some areas, long-term work remains in North Carolina,\" Swartout said.

Here's what you can expect along the route, according to the NPS release: - The Humpback Rocks, James River and Peaks of Otter visitor centers will be open. - The Mabry Mill Cultural Site will be open, and the Eastern National/America's National Parks sales outlet will operate from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. - Peaks of Otter and Rocky Knob campgrounds will operate on a first-come, first-served basis until Monday. After that, existing reservations will again be honored. Peaks of Otter Lodge will continue to operate (it did not close after the storm) If you're planning on parking your vehicle and taking a hike, the NPS warns that it has not finished its trail assessments, so exercise caution as well as your legs. You also might find fewer services than normal as many workers are helping out in North Carolina, the release said.",

    "text": "Under the aegis of the [National Peace Council (NPC)](https://www.peacecouncil.gov.gh/), Ghana’s political parties signed a [code of conduct](https://www.peacecouncil.gov.gh/storage/2019/09/Code-of-Conduct.pdf) on vigilantism and election violence in July 2024 to mark the start of the election campaign season, and inaugurated a monitoring commission to oversee compliance. “Political parties have a major responsibility to the Nation to make sure that elections in this country do not upset its prized peace and stability,” stressed NPC Chairperson Ernest Adu Gyamfi at the signing ceremony in Accra. “Violence is not a legitimate election strategy.” The representatives of the countries’ two main parties, the New Patriotic Party (NPP), currently in office, and the National Democratic Congress (NDC), in opposition, conceded that their youth wings had sometimes resorted to violence and intimidation in past elections, which was unacceptable. They welcomed the inauguration of the monitoring commission, which should help them keep their activists in line. “Violence is not a legitimate election strategy.” Ernest Adu Gyamfi, National Peace Council Chairperson The monitoring commission, which includes not only representatives of the main parties, who will provide a kind of peer review, but also the NPC, the Election Commission, the Inspectorate General of Police and the Kofi Annan Peacekeeping Training Centre, among others, will bring breaches of the code to the attention of the political parties and the NPC, which will be tasked with mediating any potential conflicts that may arise. The code ought to have a deterrence effect, and the commission will provide a means of addressing violations quickly. Ghana is a stable, democratic country with a history of successful political transitions, a free press, an active civil society, and an independent judiciary, and has held eight free and fair elections since 1992. In the most recent [Afrobarometer survey](https://www.afrobarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Summary-of-results-Ghana-Afrobarometer-R9-21oct2022-1.pdf), 76% of Ghanaians expressed support for a democratic form of government, and 67% rejected military rule, which has been gaining ground in the region. That said, general elections have regularly been marred by a degree of violence, often perpetrated by party-linked vigilantes. “At a time when democracy is in retreat, especially in West Africa, it is all the more important that Ghana remain a beacon of democracy,” stressed [Sébastien Brack], the Kofi Annan Foundation’s representative at the signing ceremony. “Although he was a global statesman, Kofi Annan was proud to be Ghanian because Ghana is famous for its peace and democracy. Every election is a test of that reputation, but also an opportunity to reaffirm Ghanaians’ commitment to a system that has served them well.” “…it is all the more important that Ghana remain a beacon of democracy.” Sébastien Brack, Kofi Annan Foundation Senior Advisor Ghana has indeed experienced significant economic development since 1992, not least thanks to its stable, peaceful and democratic political system, That said, the December 2024 elections will take place against the backdrop of a [debt crisis, public spending cuts, slow growth and rising poverty and unemployment](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/ghana/overview). More worryingly, according to [Afrobarometer](https://www.afrobarometer.org/publication/ad781-ghanaians-want-fair-and-competitive-elections-but-mistrust-the-electoral-commission/), “citizens’ confidence in the election management body is at the lowest level recorded in two decades of surveys.” The signing ceremony was the first of a [series of joint election-related activities ](https://www.kofiannanfoundation.org/elections-democracy/sustainable-democracy-ghana/)the Kofi Annan Foundation is planning with the NPC. We will also hold a series of dialogues with electoral stakeholders, especially party youth groups, in Ghana’s six “geopolitical zones” in the coming months. This will lead up to the signature of a public pledge by the presidential candidates in the run-up to the elections to eschew any hate speech or condone any violence, and to respect the outcome of the elections, or take their grievances to the courts rather than the streets. Finally, the NPC and the KAF will convene a post-election roundtable in early 2025 to address some of the recurring problems that bedevil Ghana’s elections. Source; kofiannanfoundation.org",
