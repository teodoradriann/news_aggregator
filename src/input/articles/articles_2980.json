    "text": "Taurus, love will bloom with patience and dedication in 2024. Your charm will be at its peak, improving chances in love and self-belief. This year promotes growth by releasing past attachments and inviting new deep relationships. Lonely Singles: With Saturn in the tenth house, career and social responsibilities can overshadow your romantic pursuits. On the other hand, this phase presents stability and maturity, making you appealing to partners who value commitment and desire.Jupiter in the twelfth house until April suggests a time of reflecting or spiritual awakening. Somehow, you may be led to unusual bonds or have love affairs that seem almost predestined. It is the time inward to know your desires and shed off patterns that you no longer need in your relationships. Jupiter’s movement in the first house in May marks a turning point in your love life. You will be more self-confident and optimistic and become more magnetised and receptive to new experiences. Ketu in the Fifth House might make you consider your dating style. This could lead you to abandon former emotional connections or reassess your viewpoint on love. Committed Couples: Committed individuals will experience an evolution in their romantic lives in 2024. Your love will mature, and you will feel settled in a stable relationship. This year, it is necessary to build the foundation for the partnership and generate responsible and loyal behaviour, resulting in a more robust bond.Relationships will experience the emotional depth and deep introspection till April when Jupiter will be in your twelfth house. You may have the spiritual side of your relationship on your mind. As much as you would want to know what the other person feels and wishes spiritually. Be silent, whisper in twos and love each other.Jupiter moves to your first house in May, which will rekindle your relationship in a big way. This involves hope and willingness to move forward together. Doing this will boost your confidence and help you to say what you feel and desire, and the relationship should be exciting enough to give room for adventures and discoveries. In the fifth house, Ketu will require a reassessment of the love and fire in the relationship. Talk about what you find in common and bring back that “little lightness” which attracted you initially.",

Here’s what to expect where you live. By Bryce Luff Western Australia ’s scorching start to summer is set to be felt right across the country, with Victoria to sweat through one of its hottest days in years.\nThe heat impacting WA will soon move southeast, “building and peaking across South Australia on Sunday”, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nIt will then reach Victoria and inland NSW on Monday.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n“Max temps will be up to 14C above average, reaching high-30s to high 40s across some areas,” the bureau said.\nVictoria has been tipped to record one of its hottest days in years, with Melbourne forecast to reach 41C, it’s hottest day since 2020, and regional areas hitting 45C.\nWilcannia and Ivanhoe in inland NSW have forecast maximums of 48C, while Moomba in South Australia could top 45C.\nSummer swelter “South Australia’s looking at very hot conditions on Sunday and Sunday night, as northerly winds strengthen ahead of a cooler southerly change on Monday,” 7NEWS weather presenter Amelia Mulcahy said.\n“Adelaide’s hottest day this week will be on Sunday with a top of 40C forecast.\n“The temperature could hit 42C in Adelaide’s northern suburbs while in the regions conditions will be at their hottest in SA’s east, with Renmark in the Riverland looking at a top of 44C on Monday and Moomba in the state’s north-east is expecting a top of 46C on Monday too.\n“But what will make this burst of heat most uncomfortable in SA is that there will be little relief at night.\n“Adelaide isn’t likely to drop below a minimum 27C overnight into Monday. To put that in perspective, Adelaide’s average maximum temperature for December is 26.9C.”\nMelbourne residents are set to sweat through the city’s hottest day in years. Credit: James Ross / AAP Bureau meteorologist Jonathan How said the main story this weekend is “all about the heat”, explaining it is being driven by an “area of high pressure sitting to the south and east of the country”.\n“We’ll start to see those winds turn northerly and that will bring some very hot air down towards the centre and southeast of the country so this will drive both heatwave conditions and elevated fire dangers,” How said.\n“We’ll see the heat peak across South Australia on Sunday and then across Victoria and inland NSW on Monday.”\nMulcahy said a cool change will eventually be delivered to Adelaide on Monday.\n“That change won’t reach Melbourne until night, with the city set to swelter through it’s hottest day since 2020 with a forecast top of 41C on Monday, first.”\nMelbourne could be about to sweat through its hottest day in years. Credit: James Ross / AAP Heatwave warnings Victoria: Maximum temperatures in the mid to high 30s are expected over the weekend. Low to mid-40s are forecast on Monday. “Severe heatwave conditions are expected to ease from Tuesday as a cooler southwesterly change moves across the state on Monday,” the bureau said.\nNSW: The bureau says maximum temperatures will range from the mid 30s to mid 40s. Overnight temperatures will range from the low 20s to low 30s. “Severe heatwave conditions will begin to ease during next week,” the bureau said.\nSouth Australia: Maximum temperatures will range from the mid 30s to mid 40s. The bureau says: “Severe heatwave conditions are expected to gradually contract to northeastern parts of SA over the next few days.”\nQueensland: From Saturday, extreme heatwave conditions are forecast to impact North West Queensland from Saturday into next week. Conditions are expected pose “a health risk” in Mt Isa, Dajarra and nearby areas. Severe heatwave conditions are expected to extend to much of the remaining western Queensland districts over the coming days.\nWA: Severe heatwave conditions which have poured high temperatures over Perth are moving east. Low-intensity and severe heatwave conditions remain for much of the lower third of the state. “Severe heatwave conditions are expected to move eastwards and ease over the weekend,” according to the bureau.\nACT: “Maximum temperatures will range from the high 30 to mid 40,” the bureau said. “Severe heatwave conditions will begin to ease during next week.”\nNT: Locals will sweat through highs ranging from the high 30s to mid 40s. “Severe heatwave conditions are expected to extend to remaining northern and eastern parts of the Northern Territory over the next few days,” according to the bureau.\nDisturbing discovery in car parked on Gold Coast street 1 min read\nWhite Island tragedy survivors back together for anniversary tribute 1 min read\nStream free on\nNews ACT News NSW News Queensland News WA News VIC News Weather NT News SA News",

Por lo tanto, la alternativa del momento está siendo la plataforma fundada por el empresario tecnológico Jack Dorsey , sin embargo, hay quienes apuestan por Threads por su enfoque más tradicional.\nEsta última aplicación mencionada es fruto de Meta Platforms y, en los últimos días, su responsable Adam Mosseri ha revelado que Threads ha logrado 15 millones de nuevos registros en tan solo dos semanas , alcanzando ya los 275 millones de usuarios activos mensuales. El crecimiento se debe a su capacidad para atraer usuarios, ya sea por la opción de editar las publicaciones o la introducción de los feed personalizados .\nDicha última funcionalidad mencionada llega a la app de Meta para que los usuarios puedan ver publicaciones de personas que siguen , además, Mosseri explica en una publicación que la introducción de dicha novedad \"significa menos contenido recomendado de cuentas no seguidas\".\nVer en Threads Básicamente, la novedad permite que los internautas vean de forma predeterminada su feed de seguidores cuando abran la aplicación , por lo tanto, el cambio podría hacer que el feed 'Para ti' incluya cuentas de interés para los usuarios.\nEstas son las diferencias entre X (antes Twitter) y la 'nueva' Bluesky",

    "text": "Two anglers hooked an impressive haul. It just wasn't\nfish! A fisherman and his buddy came to the aid of 38 stranded, waterlogged dogs.\nBob Gist, a State Farm agent by day and fisherman in his free time, went on a fishing trip with his friend to Mississippi. They were fishing on Grenada Lake with a local tour guide. They didn't have much luck, so they decided to move to a different area. \"We go about a half mile or so from where we were to another place and we start fishing, and pretty soon we can hear some dogs barking,\" Gist\nsaid. \"Pretty soon we saw some dogs on the horizon in the water.\"\nIt turns out there was an annual fox run in the area. The dogs were hunting dogs chasing game. They ended up chasing a deer into the water. \"We went on fishing for about 10 or 15 more minutes, and Jordan [Chrestman] said, 'Hey guys, if you don't mind, we really need to go check on those dogs because they're way out there in that water,'\" Gist said.\nHowever, all three were stunned by the number of dogs in the water.\n\"We're just flabbergasted because it's dogs everywhere, and they're all going in different directions because they can no longer see the bank on either side,\" Gist said. \"And they're all hunting dogs — we can clearly see that because they have expensive GPS radio collars on them.\"\nAngler Saves Dogs\nRealizing the\ndogs would drown without their intervention, the anglers sprung into action to help them. \"We just immediately started calling dogs on the boat, you know, grabbed their collar and put them in the [bass] boat,\" Gist said. The grabbed as many dogs as they could. In total, they managed to gather 25 to 27 dogs onto the boat.\nThey found their owners on the banks calling out to the dogs. The anglers then went back to rescue another group of dogs. A hunter with GPS led them to three or four dogs further out from the bank.\n\"They were on the verge of drowning, because now they have been treading water for an hour,\" Gist said. \"We got back over to the ramp with that last bunch of dogs... [and] we were having to drag them out of the boat because they didn't want to get out of our boat. They were scared they were going back to the water. It was terrible.\"\nGist praised his friend as the true hero of the day.\n\"If Brad and I had been there in a boat by ourselves, we wouldn't have known anything was wrong, but that 20-something-year-old kid - I'm 61, so I'm calling him a kid - he knew something needed to be done,\" Gist said. \"That kid had the presence of mind to know, 'If we don't do something, there's going to be 38 dead dogs here.' And he saved them, I mean we all pulled them in, but that kid is the hero here.\"",

    "text": "Kolkata: A rally by monks was organized in Kolkata on Friday condemning Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's recent remarks against certain monks of Ramakrishna Mission and Bharat Sevasharam Sangha.\nChristened as 'Sant Swabhiman Yatra,' the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) along with members of the Bangiya Sanyasi Samaj, an apex body of saints in the state, held the rally from North Kolkata's Bagbazar to Shimla Street, the ancestral residence of Swami Vivekananda.\n\"We condemn the remarks by the honourable chief minister against us. We are pained and feel insulted by the derogatory remarks. She is not following Raj Dharma,\" a protesting monk said.\nSenior VHP leader Sourish Mukherjee said, 'Due to vote bank politics, the chief minister is making such remarks against revered institutions like Ramakrishna Mission and Bharat Sevasharam Sangha.'\nIn a recent election rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the TMC supremo of threatening monks for vote bank politics.\nBanerjee, defending her stance, had said she only criticized specific individuals of those monastic orders and not the institutions.\nModi's remarks came a day after miscreants vandalised the Ramakrishna Mission (RKM) premises in Jalpaiguri and threatened monks and other employees at gunpoint.\nAn RKM official suggested that a local land mafia was behind the early Sunday morning incident, which was reportedly a matter of property dispute.\nThe RKM has lodged a complaint at Bhaktinagar police station against a local tough and his associates.\nFollowing Banerjee's comment, political tension intensified as both the BJP and the TMC used the development to galvanize their respective support bases ahead of the elections.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 24 May 2024, 15:47 IST",
