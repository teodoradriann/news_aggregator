Fox News Digital reached out to the department for comment.\nRead On The Fox News App\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday confirmed the country’s first severe case of bird flu in a human. There have been a total of 61 human cases throughout the country since April.\nNo human-to-human transmission has been reported, leading the CDC to maintain its stance that risk to the public is low.\nGovernor Newsom Declares State Of Emergency In California Due To Bird Flu\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Despite the low risk, California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the bird flu.\nThe declaration follows an outbreak of the virus among dairy cows in Southern California farms, according to the news release on the governor’s website.\n\"This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\" Newsom said in a statement.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the bird flu. \"Building on California’s testing and monitoring system — the largest in the nation — we are committed to further protecting public health , supporting our agricultural industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information,\" he continued.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Health Ozempic before and after: 5 women get real about weight loss, side effects and cost TODAY Dear Abby: All my decades-long friends have shunned me — I don’t know why NY Post USDA issues warning after ground beef shipment tests positive for potentially life-threatening bacteria — here's how you can stay safe The Cool Down A busy longevity clinic owner is 33 but says her biological age is 22. Here's the daily routine she follows. INSIDER \"While the risk to the public remains low, we will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus.\"\nSam Scarpino, PhD, director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, said the \"tragic case\" in Louisiana is evidence of the \"widespread nature\" of H5N1 in the U.S.\n\"It also reinforces the very serious situation we are facing,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"We need to take more decisive action to control the spread of H5N1 in animal populations. Until then, we will continue to see human spillover cases, and some of them will unfortunately be severe.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Dr. Marc Siegel , clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, pointed out that this severe case represents just one instance of the infection and is not necessarily cause for alarm.\nNo human-to-human transmission has been reported, leading the CDC to maintain its stance that risk to the public is low. \"We’d have to know more about the patient’s particular medical details,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"We can’t conclude [from one case] that it’s becoming more severe in humans.\"\nPrevious iterations of bird flu have had a 50% death rate in humans, Siegel noted, but the 61 human cases in the U.S. this year have been \"very mild.\"\n\"That is actually a good sign, that the virus is mutating away from severity, as traditionally H5N1 makes humans very sick,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter\nThe most critical thing to watch, according to the doctor, is whether bird flu will begin to spread from human to human.\n\"That’s the key thing we’re concerned about — that it doesn’t get into the upper respiratory tract among humans,\" Siegel said.\n\"Bird flu is a group of influenza viruses that primarily circulate among bird populations,\" an expert told Fox News Digital. \"However, influenza viruses are also known to jump species, and bird flu has done this a few times in history.\" Advertisement Advertisement \"It hasn’t up until now, and that’s because it would take some mutations — at least one. We’re tracking that, but probably not closely enough.\"\nThe vast majority of recent human cases have stemmed from direct contact with animals, he said — \"but it’s now spread into the cattle population and into milk, which worries a lot of people, including me.\"\nRebecca C. Christofferson, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Pathobiological Sciences at Louisiana State University, commented to Fox News Digital about the potential for a pandemic.\n\"Bird flu is a group of influenza viruses that primarily circulate among bird populations,\" she told Fox News Digital.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"However, influenza viruses are also known to jump species, and bird flu has done this a few times in history.\"\nA researcher wears a protective suit while collecting samples of wildlife where the H5N1 bird flu virus was detected in Chilean Antarctic territory in Antarctica. \"The more the virus gets into mammals and then the more it passes from mammal to mammal, the greater the concern that it will adapt to mammals and spread more easily among them and then spill over into humans,\" Christofferson added.\n\"Nobody wants another pandemic.\"\nFor more Health articles, visit foxnews.com/health\nThe good news, Cristofferson said, is that it’s easy to protect yourself from catching bird flu.\n\"If you have to handle birds or suspected ill animals (or be around ill people), wearing gloves and masks and washing your hands will protect you as it does with other respiratory viruses,\" she said.\nOriginal article source: Bird flu leads to severe human illness and state of emergency; experts discuss risk\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 20,000 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "title": "Tension au large du Yémen: nouvelles frappes américaines, nouvelle attaque des Houthis",
    "text": "Tension au large du Yémen: nouvelles frappes américaines, nouvelle attaque des Houthis L'armée américaine a abattu un drone au large du Yémen jeudi et détruit un drone de surface naval sans équipage chargé d'explosifs en mer Rouge, alors que les rebelles Houthis continuent de menacer le trafic maritime dans la région. Le Commandement militaire américain au Moyen-Orient (Centcom) a par ailleurs annoncé que ce mouvement yéménite proche de l'Iran avait lancé deux missiles visant potentiellement un cargo, mais sans le toucher. Le drone a été abattu au-dessus du golfe d'Aden tôt jeudi, a déclaré le Centcom, sans préciser à qui il appartenait. Il a toutefois imputé aux Houthis la responsabilité du navire drone, dont la destruction a provoqué des \"explosions annexes importantes\", mais pas de blessés ou de dégâts matériels. L'armée américaine avait auparavant annoncé avoir notamment détruit dix drones Houthis et trois iraniens, dans une série de frappes. Ces dernières semaines, les rebelles, qui contrôlent une grande partie du Yémen en guerre, ont multiplié les attaques visant des navires en mer Rouge et dans le golfe d'Aden, passages essentiels du commerce mondial. - \"Escalade\" - Les Houthis disent agir en solidarité avec les Palestiniens de Gaza, territoire assiégée et bombardé par Israël, en guerre contre le mouvement Hamas depuis l'attaque sanglante mené par ce dernier en sol israélien le 7 octobre. Mercredi vers 20H30 (17H30 GMT), les rebelles Houthis \"ont lancé un missile balistique antinavire (...) vers le golfe d'Aden\", a annoncé le Centcom dans un communiqué. Moins d'une heure après, ce même destroyer a \"abattu trois drones iraniens\" qui se trouvaient \"à proximité\", a ajouté le Centcom. Dans la soirée, il a encore annoncé que des frappes américaines avaient détruit dix drones d'attaque et un poste de commandement Houthis, qui \"constituaient une menace imminente pour les navires marchands et les navires militaires américains\". Plus tôt mercredi, l'armée américaine avait en outre dit avoir détruit un missile sol-air des Houthis prêt à être tiré depuis le Yémen et qui menaçait, selon elle, des avions américains. Ils ont affirmé mercredi avoir visé un bâtiment américain, le USS Gravely. D'autres groupes armés pro-iraniens ont attaqué ces derniers mois des bases américaines en Irak et en Syrie. L'une de ces attaques, a coûté dimanche la vie à trois militaires américains en Jordanie, à la frontière syrienne. Washington l'a imputée à la \"Résistance islamique en Irak\", une nébuleuse de combattants issus de groupes armés pro-Iran, Téhéran réfutant toute implication. Les Etats-Unis et l'Iran ont plusieurs fois répété qu'ils ne cherchaient pas une \"escalade\" des tensions au Moyen-Orient, dans le contexte de la guerre à Gaza. - \"Dernier recours\" - Le Premier ministre britannique Rishi Sunak a une nouvelle fois appelé jeudi à l'arrêt des attaques \"inconsidérées\" des Houthis, lors d'un entretien téléphonique avec le sultan Haitham d'Oman, pays voisin du Yémen et médiateur important entre l'Iran et les pays occidentaux. Rishi Sunak, dont le pays a mené plusieurs frappes conjointes contre les Houthis avec Washington, \"a souligné que l'action militaire n'était qu'un dernier recours face à des menaces intolérables pour la navigation mondiale\", selon un communiqué de son bureau. Dans le golfe d'Aden, un autre navire marchand a été touché par un missile, qui a provoqué une explosion à bord, a indiqué jeudi la société britannique de sécurité maritime Ambrey. Les Houthis, qui affirment viser des navires liés à Israël, ont mené plus de 35 attaques contre des navires au large du Yémen depuis le 19 novembre, selon le ministère américain de la Défense. Avant de lancer des frappes en janvier, les Etats-Unis, principal allié d'Israël, avaient déployé des navires de guerre en mer Rouge et mis en place une coalition maritime internationale pour \"protéger\" cette zone cruciale par où transite jusqu'à 12% du commerce mondial. Depuis, les Houthis considèrent également les navires liés aux Etats-Unis ou au Royaume-Uni comme des \"cibles légitimes\". Washington a annoncé mi-janvier les désigner à nouveau comme une entité \"terroriste\". L'impact de ces tensions dans cette zone est lourd: le transport maritime de conteneurs par la mer Rouge a chuté de près de 30% sur un an, a annoncé mercredi le Fonds monétaire international (FMI).
