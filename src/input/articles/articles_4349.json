    "text": "Construction on new public safety building in Washington County set to begin this spring Washington County officials say it’s a move that will be good not just for the Sheriff’s Office, but for the public. MACHIAS, Maine (WABI) - It’s a move Washington County officials say is necessary and has been a long time coming. Construction will begin soon on a new public safety building. It will be built in Machias where the former district attorney’s office once stood. “It’s kind of a challenge to get to us where this one here will be more convenient for the public,” said [Washington County Sheriff,](https://washingtoncountymaine.com/sherifs-office/) Barry Curtis. “Washington County has seven facilities, and we’re all pretty spread out, and the mission of the county commissioners is to try and consolidate some of that,” explained Washington County Manager, Renée Gray. Washington County officials say it’s a move that will be good not just for the Sheriff’s Office, but for the public. “There’s a lot more modern ways to save money; windows, insulation, things that the other building that we tore down didn’t have,” Gray added. “It was a big expense actually, and it was going to need a lot of repairs.” The new public safety building, located across from the current Sheriff’s Office building on Court Street, will provide more space and be more secure for staff. The new two-story facility will house the Washington County Sheriff’s Office and staff from the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency. “It’s kind of nice because we’ll be able to communicate with each other a lot quicker than we have been,” Curtis said. Officials say $5.5 million of ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act of 2021) funds will be used for the new building. “Taxpayer dollars will not be put into this at all,” said Gray. The sheriff’s department building and the courthouse are historic buildings for Machias, both built in the 1850s. Washington County Sheriff Barry Curtis gave us a tour of the current sheriff’s office, showing us the small hallways and office spaces. He says once the new building is complete, the former sheriff’s office will house jail administration. “Two lieutenants will be moving over there, giving us more space in the jail area as far as storage which we don’t have,” he said. “Even though that was redone in 1980 something, it wasn’t big enough. and so, that did not allow for growth, and now will spread out and it gives them all a chance to have their own office space. It makes it a lot easier.” Construction is slated to last about ten months. The hope is the new public safety building will be open to the public in March 2025. Sheriff Curtis hopes the public will be pleased with the new facility. “I want pictures of Washington County on the walls. I want to make it Washington County,” he added. Copyright 2024 WABI.

    "title": "Japanese seaweed: The superfood you can find everywhere - Japan Today",
    "text": "Since ancient times, Japan has used sea plants in various ways, including food sources, dietary supplements, plant fertilizers and medical treatments. Pastes made from Japanese seaweed were once used to heal burns, as it was believed they prevented bacterial infections and soothed the skin. In modern times, this practice is continued through the use of facemasks and seaweed-rich serums.\nKaiso (seaweeds) are also a staple of the Japanese diet. They’re an essential attribute of your miso soup, onigiri, sushi, salads and nori bento, among many more. Thanks to its numerous health and beauty benefits, widespread availability and cheap cost, Japanese seaweed has become a globally recognized staple food and beauty ingredient that we can easily incorporate into our lives. But before you rush to the supermarket, read on to learn more about the different types of kaiso, their benefits and ways to use them in your daily life. Here are six key players!\nNori Kombu Wakame Hijiki Mozuku Aonori 1. Nori (海苔)\nImage: iStock: Amarita Nori is the most familiar seaweed. Although it looks green, it is actually a type of red algae. When dried out or roasted, takes on an almost black appearance. In its most common form, nori comes as roasted sheets.\nWith quite an impressive nutritional profile, nori is loaded with iodine, potassium and vitamin B12 and is low in calories, making it a healthy snack between meals. Iodine is a mineral that is essential for your metabolism and helps the thyroid gland to function properly. Consuming one sheet of roasted nori paper will give you about half of the daily recommended intake of iodine along with about 1.2 mg of vitamin B12—an essential vitamin that supports the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system as well as helps to form red blood cells.\nHow To Eat Nori Wrap it around your makizushi , onigiri or mochi (after toasting and dipping it in soy sauce). Add dried nori to your miso soup. Try Gohan desu yo (ご飯ですよ！) paste by topping it on your rice or toas. It’s available at most supermarkets in Japan for around ¥280. 2. Kombu (昆布\nImage: iStock: key05 Kombu is an edible sea kelp that grows in long strips and looks exactly like what you think of if you picture seaweed washing up on the beach. Rich in calcium, Kombu has nutritional benefits that support cellular health and balance. It is a rich source of keratin and thus can contribute to shiny hair and strong nails.\nOther notable health benefits include improving digestion and helping to reduce gas, improving thyroid function and helping with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is also a great source of iron (which helps prevent anemia) and dietary fiber.\nKombu is also known for its umami properties. For this reason, it is one of the main ingredients in Japanese cuisine, used to make dashi (soup stock).\nHow To Eat Kombu Use kombu stock for nabe , shabu shabu or other regular Japanese soups. Stir-fry it with cabbage and other vegetables. Drink kombucha, a common type of Japanese tea that is rich in minerals and aids in digestion. It is made from dried and powdered kombu. Snack on dried kombu cuts like torobe (とろべ～) . It’s available at most supermarkets in Japan for around ¥300. 3. Wakame (わかめ)\nImage: iStock: MaxCab Wakame is another kind of sea kelp similar to kombu, but much more tender and succulent. It grows abundantly throughout the coastal regions of Japan and is extremely rich in vitamins A, C, D, E, K and B2, minerals such as iodine, calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc and magnesium, and packed with antioxidants. Also, it contains a lot of folic acids, so it’s highly recommended for pregnant women or nursing mothers.\nWakame is a highly recommended ingredient for people with high cholesterol. It is rich in fucoxanthin, which stimulates the liver to increase the production of DHA, which is known for lowering the levels of LDL (i.e.: bad) cholesterol in your system. Since cholesterol is required as a building block for the production of estrogen, the cholesterol-lowering effects of wakame may also help to reduce the risk of certain estrogen-sensitive cancers.\nLike other seaweeds, wakame can also balance weight (it is filling but extremely low in calories) and support thyroid health. Extremely rich in iodine — one of the essential components of our bodies’ hormonal balance and an integral aspect of creating the thyroid hormone—and omega-3 fatty acids, wakame helps boost our energy, reduce anxiety and fight depression.\nHow To Eat Wakame Add it as an addition to pretty much everything, including:\nMiso soup as well as other dashi-based soups Salad Udon Spaghetti dishes that use Japanese sauces like tarako (cod roe) or soy sauce Click here to read more.",

    "text": "Staff members work at the production line of a workshop at Nongyao Agricultural Development Co Ltd in Zhijin County, southwest China’s Guizhou Province on July 11, 2024. – Xinhua photo\nGUIYANG (March 13): Yang Chuang, a farmer in a remote village in southwest China’s Guizhou Province, harvested over 700 tonnes of pumpkins last year, which were processed into dehydrated pumpkin strips and exported to the Republic of Korea (ROK).\nYang is reaping the benefits of contract-based farming, which sees farmers sell their produce wholesale to companies before they are grown. In Yang’s case, his pumpkins are bought by the Nongyao Agricultural Development Co Ltd based in Zhijin County.\nIn 2023, with technical guidance from the company, Yang trial-planted just 2 hectares of pumpkins.\nThe company purchased his entire harvest at a guaranteed price, bringing him significant profits.\nEncouraged by the success, the 27-year-old expanded his plantation tenfold in 2024, and sold 700 tonnes of pumpkins to the company.\nThe contract-based farming model not only relieves farmers of sales concerns but also ensures a stable supply of raw materials for processing enterprises.\nNongyao, a key agricultural export enterprise in Zhijin County, temporarily halted production at the end of 2024 after selling out all its pumpkin products.\nTo meet growing demand, the company is actively securing pumpkin supply contracts with partners across Guizhou and neighboring provinces including Hubei, Sichuan, and Yunnan.\n“We’re not worried about foreign trade orders. Our biggest challenge is securing enough raw pumpkins.\n“If we had enough stock, we could keep production running continuously,” said Zeng Aisheng, chairman of the company.\nCurrently, the enterprise has the capacity to produce 7,500 tonnes of pumpkin strips and granules a year, in addition to 3,000 tonnes of other dehydrated vegetables.\nIn 2024, its exports totaled 23.16 million yuan (about us$3.19 million), a staggering 345 percent increase year on year.\nIn the first two months of 2025, the figure had already reached 8.75 million yuan.\nFor 2025, the company has already signed contracts to export pumpkin, chili pepper, tomato and other processed agricultural products to ROK, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and other countries.\nKnown as China’s “hometown of pumpkins”, Zhijin County produces over 100,000 tonnes of pumpkins a year. The industry engages over 30,000 local farmers.\nWith the support of local governments and leading enterprises like Nongyao, pumpkin growing has expanded from Zhijin to over 10 neighboring counties.\nIn 2025, the province plans to scale up contract-based pumpkin cultivation to over 13,000 hectares, with an estimated output of 500,000 tonnes, further advancing the development of an agriculture based on its mountainous terrains.\nZhijin County is among the first pilot areas for “rural foreign trade” in Guizhou.\nSince 2023, the province has been integrating rural industries with foreign trade, fostering enterprises and products with strong local characteristics and export potential, thereby opening international markets for high-quality agricultural goods.\nBeyond pumpkins, Cengong County has also tapped into global markets, exporting specialty pomelos, tangerines, kiwi fruit, and passion fruit to Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. – Xinhua",

    "title": "Colère des agriculteurs français : des camions étrangers arrêtés et vidés",
    "text": "Plus d'une dizaine de cargaisons de camions étrangers ont été vidées par des agriculteurs français qui font pression sur le gouvernement, appelant ce dernier à les protéger face aux importations bon marché, la hausse des coûts et formalités administratives. La manifestation qui a été convoquée la semaine dernière dans le sud-ouest s'est intensifiée au fil des jours, alors que jeudi elle se rapprochait de Paris. Les agriculteurs ont affirmé que les manifestations se poursuivraient jusqu'à ce que leurs revendications soient satisfaites, posant un défi au nouveau Premier ministre Gabriel Attal. « Nous nous rapprochons progressivement de Paris », a déclaré l'agriculteur David Lavenant à la chaîne BFM-TV. Des cargaisons de légumes, notamment des tomates, des choux et des choux-fleurs, importés selon les agriculteurs des pays voisins, ont été déversées et jonchées de déchets sur l'autoroute A7, qui relie Marseille à Lyon, l'une des plus grandes villes du pays. Un clip vidéo viral sur les réseaux sociaux montrait des agriculteurs déversant des camions de fumier dans une succursale de McDonald's après que le restaurant a refusé de distribuer du café de solidarité gratuit à un groupe d'agriculteurs qui étaient en route pour épandre du fumier à un autre endroit. McDonald's a été critiqué dans le passé par les agriculteurs français pour s'approvisionner en viande importée plutôt qu'en France. Les agriculteurs affirment qu’ils sont confrontés à des pressions venant de multiples directions, coincés entre les demandes des acheteurs des supermarchés et l’industrie alimentaire qui a de graves conséquences sur leurs bénéfices, ainsi que les réglementations environnementales concernant des pratiques telles que le fait de laisser les terres incultes et l’application de pesticides. « Nous sommes coincés entre la hausse des coûts et la baisse des prix de nos produits », a déclaré Dominique Kretz, un agriculteur parmi plusieurs centaines qui bloquent l'autoroute M35 près de la ville de Strasbourg, dans l'est du pays. Parmi les griefs des agriculteurs figurent également la taxe gouvernementale sur le carburant des tracteurs, les problèmes de stockage de l’eau et les pressions sur les prix exercées par les détaillants. Le gouvernement du président Emmanuel Macron espère que les manifestations se calmeront car, elles pourraient reproduire les manifestations massives des « Gilets jaunes » de 2018-2019, qui ont également été déclenchées par la hausse des prix du diesel. Les manifestations surviennent à l'approche de la campagne pour les élections parlementaires européennes de juin, où le secteur agricole devrait être un sujet de débat. La dirigeante d’extrême droite, Marine Le Pen, opposante à Macron et dont le Rassemblement national obtient de solides résultats dans les sondages, a imputé les problèmes économiques des agriculteurs aux accords de libre-échange, aux importations et à la bureaucratie. « Les pires ennemis des agriculteurs se trouvent dans ce gouvernement », a-t-elle déclaré jeudi. Macron craint que le secteur agricole ne constitue un électorat croissant pour l’extrême droite, alors que ses opposants profitent des manifestations d’agriculteurs pour dénigrer le bilan de son gouvernement à l’approche des élections européennes. « Emmanuel Macron s'adresse aux agriculteurs avec une main sur l'épaule puis les poignarde dans le dos à Bruxelles », a déclaré Le Pen aux journalistes. Mercredi soir, l'influent syndicat agricole FNSEA a présenté au gouvernement une liste exhaustive de 100 demandes, a exigé des « réponses immédiates sur les salaires », une aide urgente pour « les secteurs les plus touchés par la crise » et, à long terme, de mettre « un mettre fin à la surcharge réglementaire ». Selon le porte-parole de la FNSEA, Yohann Barbe, les revendications portaient également sur « l'aide aux agriculteurs à retrouver leur dignité, leur capacité à gagner leur vie », a-t-il déclaré sur RMC. Les agriculteurs français souhaitent notamment être exemptés des règles européennes proposées réduisant l’utilisation de pesticides ou obligeant les agriculteurs à mettre de côté une partie de leurs terres arables pour favoriser la biodiversité.",

The animal had a deep wound in its neck caused by a fragment of a fishing net. A sea lion found horrifically injured with a fishing wire wrapped around its neck has been released back into the sea after a successful recovery. The animal was rescued by the Mundo Marino Foundation after they were alerted that the animal was left stranded on a beach between the towns of San Clemente and Las Toninas in Argentina on 2nd January. The video shows the sea lion with the net trapped on its neck, and as rescuers remove it, a deep wound can be seen being caused by the sharp object. Juan Pablo Loureiro, veterinarian and technical director of the Mundo Marino Foundation said in a statement obtained by Newsflash from Mundo Marino: \"Upon entering the Rescue Centre we observed an underweight animal, with a deep and cutting wound on the neck, but with a good attitude. \"In that sense, we first proceeded to extract the fragment of fishing net that caused the wound and then we began to apply an antiseptic substance to the entire injured area to clean and remove all the necrotic tissue.\" After a month of recovery, the sea lion of the South American Dos Pelos species (Arctocephalus australis) was released back to the sea, on the beaches of San Clemente, on 5th February. It can be seen in the video turning back towards its rescuers as if it wants to thank them before going back to its natural habitat. Biologist and head of the Rescue Center of the Mundo Marino Foundation, Sergio Rodriguez Heredia, said: \"This case is a clear example of the negative impact of our bad actions: contamination by garbage, plastic and remains of nets in the ocean. \"With this case of this little wolf, we see what our carelessness causes in animals\".

    "text": "Estonia plans to sign a bilateral agreement on security guarantees under the Group of Seven (G7) Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on March 8 during a joint press conference in Vilnius. Foreign ministers of Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and France met on March 8 to discuss further help to Ukraine amid the ongoing Russia’s full-scale invasion. \"We are going to sign a bilateral agreement between Estonia and Ukraine for a long-term commitment as well. Estonia has poured 1.4% of its GDP into Ukraine to support its victory, and we will continue,\" Tsahkna [said](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZfBqtN6x6yo?si=7M_1fc6JW7ezUorL). [Estonia](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-says-it-stopped-hybrid-operation-by-russian-security-services/) has been one of the leading military donors to Ukraine in terms of share of GDP since the beginning of the all-out war in 2022. [Tallinn](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-pledges-1-3-billion-for-ukraine-until-2027/) pledged in January to allocate 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) for Kyiv until the year 2027, a major commitment from a country of 1.3 million people. Tsahkna also announced that the Estonian government will approve a new military aid package for Ukraine next week. \"When we are signing a bilateral agreement between Estonia and Ukraine, we are promising and taking a commitment of 0.25% of (Estonian) GDP military support per year,\" the Estonian foreign minister added. Tsahkna also urged other allies to contribute, saying that 120 billion euros ($131.2 billion) of military support per year \"would be enough for Ukraine to push back Russia.\" The Group of Seven (G7) members [agreed](https://kyivindependent.com/g7-reveals-plans-to-deter-future-russian-aggression-against-ukraine/) on a joint declaration on \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine on July 12, 2023, at the NATO summit in Vilnius, aiming to entail explicit and long-lasting obligations to bolster Ukraine's ability to resist Russian aggression. Tallinn earlier delivered [Javelin anti-tank missiles](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-delivers-javelin-anti-tank-missiles-other-military-aid-to-ukraine/), [ammunition](https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-estonian-arms-dealer-sold-target-markers-to-ukraine-for-inflated-price/), and other military aid to Ukraine as part of an 80 million euros ($86 million) [military aid package](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-to-send-88-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/) approved in December.",
