    "text": "Reply To:\nName - Reply Comment\nThe burgeoning partnership between India and Sri Lanka in the energy sector unfolds as a tale of promise and progress, rooted in mutual respect and shared goals. With a focus on sustainable development and collaboration, both nations are poised to reap the rewards of this dynamic relationship.\nIndia's interest in Sri Lanka's energy sector is driven by a sincere desire to assist its neighbor in overcoming challenges and embracing opportunities. Sri Lanka's heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels presents a unique opportunity for India to share its expertise in renewable energy. By investing in solar and wind power projects, India is not only supporting Sri Lanka's transition to clean energy but also fostering greater energy security and resilience to climate change.\nCompanies like Adani Green, L&T, and Tata Power are leading the charge in this transformative journey, bringing their knowledge and resources to bear on upgrading Sri Lanka's energy infrastructure. Through initiatives aimed at improving transmission and distribution efficiency, these partnerships are laying the foundation for a more reliable and cost-effective energy system.\nIndia has emerged as a key player in Sri Lanka's renewable energy transition. Adani Green, a leading Indian renewable energy company, announced a $750 million investment in developing solar and wind power projects. The group is also planning to set up a cross-country transmission corridor from Sri Lanka that will connect to the Indian power grid on the lines between India and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka, like many nations, is prioritizing the development of its energy infrastructure to meet the growing demand for electricity while reducing the environmental impact. Adani Green's substantial investment is expected to play a pivotal role in achieving these goals and ensuring a more sustainable energy future for the country.\nMeanwhile, India is likely to start supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Sri Lanka by the end of next year and will eventually establish an offshore regasification terminal at the Colombo port. The supply — which will be done using tankers that will be shipped to Colombo — as well as the terminal construction and operation will be done by India’s largest LNG terminal operator Petronet LNG.\nPetronet LNG will supply around 850 tonnes a day of LNG, or super-chilled gas, to Sri Lanka for five years, during which it plans to build and commission a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU), which is essentially a regasification unit housed on a vessel, Petronet LNG’s Chief Executive Officer Akshay Kumar Singh told reporters at India Energy Week in Goa. The firm is looking to supply around 350,000 tonnes of LNG to the island nation every year.\n“The requirement is almost 50 containers per day and we will have to take it through barges there…then again regasify there (using a vapouriser). So, 50 tankers (one tanker is around 17 metric tonnes)…need to be transported per day to Sri Lanka,” Singh said, adding that the average frequency of supply will be once in two days using ships that can accommodate 100 such tankers.\nSri Lanka has been scouting for LNG for running gas-based power plants and use it in other industries, and has now agreed to take supplies from Petronet LNG. As for the planned FSRU, it has been under discussion for years, and is finally likely to see the light of day some time in 2028.\nFurthermore, India's commitment to diversifying Sri Lanka's energy sources underscores its dedication to long-term sustainability. By exploring cleaner alternatives and promoting regional energy integration, India is helping to reduce Sri Lanka's dependence on volatile oil markets while enhancing its energy sovereignty.\nIndia and Sri Lanka are giving a fresh push to the long-pending power grid connectivity between the two countries to trade electricity.\nWork has started on updating a detailed project report for the connectivity either through overhead line or undersea cable in the sea portion of the connectivity. Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said that Sri Lanka’s government has priortised regional energy integration with grid connectivity between Sri Lanka and India to be implemented by 2030.\nThe World Bank has been assisting the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in understanding the technical requirements and business models for the project.\nIn 2022, Sri Lanka and India were eyeing an over-water cable to link the power grids of the two countries, dropping an earlier plan for a submarine cable.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe's vision for India-Sri Lanka power grid connectivity symbolizes the strength of this partnership. By harnessing the potential of green energy and leveraging technological advancements, both nations stand to benefit economically and environmentally.\nPresident Wickremesinghe has reiterated his government’s plans for India-Sri Lanka power grid connectivity even as low-intesity protests begin to emerge around the country against a recent power tariff hike.\nWhile Indian investments bring significant opportunities, it is essential to address concerns about sovereignty and environmental impact. By engaging in transparent dialogue and prioritizing sustainable practices, India and Sri Lanka can navigate these challenges together, ensuring that their partnership remains grounded in shared values and mutual respect.\nIn essence, the India-Sri Lanka energy partnership represents a shining example of cooperation and collaboration in the pursuit of a brighter, cleaner future for all.\nAdd commentComments will be edited (grammar, spelling and slang) and authorized at the discretion of Daily Mirror online.

    "text": "- Recognized for excellence in augmented reality technology, apps, and device sets.\n- To be showcased at the CES 2024 booth... with a new Disney product launch planned for the first half of the year.\nWoongjin Thinkbig's ARpedia, a global edutech product, has won the 'CES 2024 Innovation Award', marking the first time a Korean educational company has achieved this honor three times in a row. Leading the global education market as a pioneering edutech solution, ARpedia has demonstrated its unique augmented reality technology and innovation.\nARpedia, developed by Woongjin Thinkbig, one of Korea's leading edutech companies, is an 'Interactive Book' that provides a three-dimensional reading experience by bringing characters and illustrations from books to life through augmented reality (AR) technology. In Korea, it's a popular series with over 6 million individual books sold. Internationally, it has proven its market potential with contracts to supply at least 80,000 sets annually in the Chinese-speaking region (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau).\nThis achievement is largely attributed to the global recognition of ARpedia's unique technology and educational effectiveness. At CES 2024, ARpedia won the 'Mobile Devices and Accessories' innovation award, securing its third consecutive title. This particular win is noteworthy as it acknowledges the excellence of ARpedia in all aspects of its set, including augmented reality technology (CES 2023, AR/VR category), apps (CES 2022-2023, Mobile Apps category), and devices (CES 2024).\nWoongjin Thinkbig plans to introduce ARpedia to business representatives and visitors from various countries at CES 2024. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore all series that comprise the ARpedia set and learn in detail about the products' features and usage.\nFurthermore, Woongjin Thinkbig is set to launch a new reading series, 'Disney Interactive Reading', in the first half of this year, based on a licensing agreement with Walt Disney. The initial marketing strategy will focus on Asian countries, where there is high demand for English reading education.\nSam-rak Choi, the head of Woongjin Thinkbig's EduTech Research Institute, commented, \"ARpedia is sought after by companies and educational industry representatives in 24 countries where it is currently exported.

Targeting the international market, the English version of 'ARpedia' has received much acclaim and several global awards, including being the first Korean educational company to win the 'CES Innovation Award' three times in a row. In 2022 alone, ARpedia won the 'Kid’s Judge BETT', 'Mom’s Choice Award', and 'Teacher’s Choice Award', proving its success with children, parents, and teachers alike. In July 2023, Woongjin Thinkbig signed a licensing agreement with global entertainment giant Walt Disney for the launch of the Disney series.\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BmORcfbQo8\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: WOONGJIN THINKBIG\nContact Person: JR Kim\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: South Korea\nWebsite: http://www.arpediabook.com\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "By Natalie O'Neill ,\n13 hours ago\nThey should have made her beat it.\nA Bronx break dancing pioneer called for an investigation Thursday into the Olympics governing body that allowed the widely mocked Australian dancer Raygun to compete in Paris with such an embarrassing lack of skills.\nRichard “Crazy Legs” Colon said the dancer — who went viral after losing all three of her battles by scores of 18-0 Friday— should have been better vetted by officials before making a laughingstock of the sport as it debuted on the world stage.\n“There should be an investigation into why the World DanceSport Federation allowed this to happen,” Colon, 58, told The Post.\n“They should have required a certain level of expertise to be at the Olympics.”\nNew York City break dancing legend Crazy Legs called for an investigation into how RayGun was allowed to compete at the Olympics. WireImage Raygun ‘represented hard’ in much-criticized Olympic routine: Australian teammate\nRachael “Raygun” Gunn caught heat online for her stunningly awkward interpretive dance-style moves — which included floor-writhing, goofy freezes and a “kangaroo hop.”\nThe 36-year-old Sydney University professor’s performance was such a disaster , critics accused her of “getting zero points on purpose” — and she was later spoofed by comedian Rachel Dratch on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n“Breaking comes from a culture of people who have lived a difficult life — so when we see something like that we’re like, ‘Yo, is that a joke?,’” Colon said of RayGun’s overly “academic” interpretive dance style.\n“Maybe it’s a hobby for her — and that’s fine. Do your thing, girl, have fun,” he said. “But you’re on the wrong stage.\nUSWNT’s Tierna Davidson feels Olympic gold medal sweeter after battling adversity\n“You can’t just go in there and disrupt a whole culture of people,” he said.\nRayGun showcased awkward moves such as “the kangaroo.” Getty Images Colon chalked the potential Olympic flub up to “a faulty system” that failed to create a “minimum acceptance standard” for the new sport.\n“You don’t have to be an expert to a drive a car but you have to be good enough not to hurt other people on the street,” he said — comparing her moves to a car crash.\nThe bumbling B-girl took the place of more talented Australian breakers likely because they lacked the resources or money to make it to the Olympics, Colon said.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR METRO DAILY NEWSLETTER\nRaygun lost all of her breaking battles 18-0. Getty Images “It would have been nice if she had bowed out,” he said. “She was taking an opportunity from someone else.”\nStill, he said some of the “hate” she received online was unfair, like folks who knocked her geeky green and gold tracksuit.\n“The outfit is a minor thing,” he said.\nBut breaking badly is a bigger problem.\n“She just didn’t have the talent,” he said.\nOn Thursday, RayGun broke her silence over the online backlash over her performance saying, “I did take it very seriously” and “worked my butt off preparing.”\nFor the latest metro stories, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/metro/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Por no cumplir con la normativa en salud, la Secretaría de Desarrollo de la Salud de la Gobernación de Córdoba cerró totalmente y de forma temporal dos establecimientos que prestan servicios de estética en el municipio de Sahagún.\n(Le puede interesar: Asesinaron a balazos a un excandidato al Concejo de San Onofre)\nLas quejas de la ciudadanía que fueron instauradas en la dependencia departamental y en la Superintendencia Nacional de la Salud, fueron corroboradas por el personal de Inspección, Vigilancia y Control de la Secretaría de Desarrollo de la Salud de la Gobernación de Córdoba.\nEstética Garcés y Claro de Luna, fueron los centros que cerraron y para que puedan abrir nuevamente sus puertas y seguir prestando los servicios a la ciudadanía, deben subsanar todos los hallazgos encontrados por las autoridades del sector salud, según lo explicó Marco Támara Burgos, director de Inspección, Vigilancia y Control de la Secretaría de Desarrollo de la Salud.\n(Vea aquí: En Chimichagua, Cesar, una mujer fue capturada por violencia intrafamiliar)\n“Hicimos una visita tras una denuncia que nos llegó a la oficina de IVC, teniendo en cuenta un procedimiento que se hizo una usuaria y que la llevó a estar hoy en una clínica hospitalizada. Con base en esta visita se aplicó todo, verificación de cumplimiento de la normatividad, los formatos que contemplan dentro de la normativa colombiana y es una visita sanitaria cuyo resultado fue desfavorable, por lo que se toma la decisión, con base en todos los hallazgos, de un cierre total temporal del establecimiento”, expresó Támara Burgos.\nA su vez, invita a la ciudadanía en general a ser cuidadosa en la selección de sitios para hacerse procedimientos, especialmente si son quirúrgicos o invasivos, pues para realizarlos, los establecimientos deben contar con la habilitación de servicios y personal idóneo.",
