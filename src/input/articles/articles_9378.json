    "text": "The [Freedom From Religion Foundation is calling out Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Núñez](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Lt.-Gov.-Jeanette-Nun%CC%83ez-FL-1.pdf) after her recent comment at an anti-abortion rally deriding people who “vote like atheists.” FFRF learned of a “campaign-like rally” on Monday where Núñez and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appeared in their official capacities to oppose Amendment 4, a pro-legal abortion amendment on the Florida ballot. At the event, [Núñez remarked](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ron-desantis-florida-election-2024-6fa32787580e935a819248504345cb3c), “We cannot go to church and pray like Christians and turn around and vote like atheists.” FFRF blasted her insulting implication that it is wrong to “vote like an atheist,” and also her false assumption that Christians in general don’t support reproductive freedom. “While your remarks were intended to denigrate atheists and promote your own Christian beliefs, in fact we would suggest that our country would be a whole lot better off if more people ‘voted like an atheist,’” FFRF Co-Presidents [Annie Laurie Gaylor and Dan Barker have written to Núñez](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Lt.-Gov.-Jeanette-Nun%CC%83ez-FL-1.pdf), citing surveys showing the humanistic voter values of atheists and other nonreligious Americans. They also cited statistics showing that abortion rights are favored by a majority of America’s faithful, even Catholics and Mormons, with the exception of white evangelicals and similar strains. FFRF requested that in future Núñez refrain from using her elected position as lieutenant governor to denigrate minority beliefs on religion while promoting her own personal religious beliefs. She’s free to practice her religion in her personal capacity, but not to abuse her authority as a government official to turn one class — her kind of Christian — into a favored class, and turn another class — atheists — into a disfavored class. As lieutenant governor of Florida, Núñez is tasked with upholding the U.S. Constitution — including the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. Núñez serves a diverse state that consists not only of Christians, but also Jewish, Muslim, atheist and other non-Christian constituents. When she promotes Christianity through official communications, she marginalizes and excludes many of her constituents. A full [37 percent](https://www.pewforum.org/2021/12/14/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-are-now-religiously-unaffiliated/) of Americans are non-Christian, including nearly one-in-three Americans on a national level who are religiously unaffiliated. The religiously unaffiliated specifically comprise [26 percent](https://ava.prri.org/#religious/2022/States/religion/m/US-FL) of Florida’s population. “Please start honoring the secular Constitution you took an oath to uphold,” FFRF concludes. The Freedom From Religion Foundation is a national nonprofit organization with 40,000 members and several chapters across the country, including 2,000 members and the Central Florida Freethought Community chapter in Florida. Its purposes are to protect the constitutional principle of separation between state and church, and to educate the public on matters relating to nontheism.",

    "text": "Ha inviato un messaggio all’utente con cui stava giocando on line sostenendo di voler compiere un gesto estremo . Ravvisata la gravità delle intenzioni, il destinatario del messaggio, un coetaneo residente all’estero, ha pensato subito di dare l’allarme e la Sala Operativa Interpol ha inviato alla Sala Operativa della Questura di Catania una nota di rintraccio per il giovane, un 17enne di Paternò.\nL’annuncio L’utente ha spiegato ai poliziotti che, dopo aver giocato in una nota piattaforma di gaming on line, ha scambiato diversi messaggi con il 17enne paternese fino a quando non è sorto un alterco virtuale tra i due e, colto da una crisi di nervi, il ragazzo ha manifestato intenti suicidi.\nRaccolta la segnalazione dell’Interpol, la Questura di Catania ha immediatamente attivato gli agenti del Commissariato di Pubblica Sicurezza di Adrano per verificare l’attendibilità del contenuto della segnalazione ed evitare possibili tragici epiloghi.\nL’intervento I poliziotti hanno raggiunto prima l’indirizzo segnalato e, non trovando il giovane, hanno raccolto alcune necessarie informazioni dai condomini dello stabile che hanno spiegato come, in realtà, il ragazzo si trovava domiciliato con la madre. Giunti all’abitazione della donna, gli agenti del Commissariato di Adrano hanno trovato il ragazzo che si trovava in compagnia della madre e appariva assolutamente tranquillo e in buona salute.\nDopo aver spiegato la ragione della loro presenza e sentita la versione dei fatti, che confermava quanto accaduto tra i giovani gamer, i poliziotti hanno sensibilizzato il giovane ad evitare, in futuro, di tenere condotte tali da creare allarme e apprensione.\nIl salvataggio a Palermo Gli agenti di polizia delle volanti hanno salvato un uomo che lasciato dalla compagna voleva gettarsi dal ponte nei pressi del Baby Luna a Palermo lungo viale Regione Siciliana.\nL’uomo aveva scritto una lettera d’addio nella quale affermava che senza la donna non poteva più vivere. Inizialmente si era tenuto anche il peggio. La paura che l’uomo in preda ad uno stato di delirio e di convulsioni che già aveva scavalcato la recinzione avesse aggredito la compagnia prima di togliersi la vita.\nFortunatamente la donna è stata contattata, stava bene e non sapeva nulla di quanto stava accadendo al ponte Corleone. Gli agenti si sono concentrati sull’uomo. Hanno cercato di calmarlo e poi sono riusciti a bloccarlo evitando che l’uomo compisse l’estremo gesto.\nUna volta bloccato l’uomo è stato affidato ai sanitari del 118 che lo hanno trasportato in ospedale dove è stato ricoverato.",

They all giddily ran to the golf carts and began honking the horns, as one does. Some players even test drove theirs. Hurts and Barkley loved watching their teammates enjoy their new gifts.\nHurts may have drawn inspiration from [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.si.com/nfl/team/kansas-city-chiefs) quarterback Patrick Mahomes, [who gifted his offensive linemen with golf carts last season](https://www.si.com/nfl/2023/12/21/patrick-mahomes-gifts-line-golf-carts-christmas-arrowhead).

    "text": "Bishop Emeritus Willie Walsh has died at the age of 90.\nHe was widely viewed as a progressive figure within the Catholic Church and the current Bishop of Killaloe said there is a “profound sadness” at his passing.\nWalsh died last night and funeral arrangements will follow later.\nHe served as the Bishop of the Killaloe Diocese for 16 years, before submitting his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI upon reaching the retirement age of 75 in 2010.\nWalsh was ordained a priest in 1959 and also taught in St Flannan’s in Ennis.\nWalsh made headlines in 1999 when he embarked on a three-week “Pilgrimage of Reconciliation” which involved him walking to each church in his diocese to apologise for child sexual abuse scandals within the Church.\nThe Killaloe Diocese said Walsh “undertook to walk across the Diocese from Loop Head to Kinnity as a sign of solidarity and repentance to all who had been hurt”.\nAnd in 2015, Walsh hit out at the Vatican for claiming that the passing of the marriage equality referendum in Ireland was a “defeat for humanity”.\nThese remarks were made by the Vatican’s Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who said: “I think that you cannot just talk of a defeat for Christian principles, but of a defeat for humanity.”\nWalsh told RTÉ Radio that this was an “inappropriate statement” and he added that it was “not one I think that represents the mind of Pope Francis despite it coming from a very senior Church figure”.\nWalsh added that Parolin’s comments made him “uncomfortable” and said: “There has been lots of disasters in the world but I certainly would not support the belief that the referendum was among them.”\nMeanwhile, Walsh also voiced support for Catholic priests to be able to marry.\nIn a 2005 interview with the now defunct Sunday Tribune, Walsh said that there was “room for both priests who are married and celibate priests in our Church”.\nHe also voiced concern in the interview that the Catholic Church was losing “some very fine priests” who had left the priesthood due to the need to remain celibate.\n“Unless in some way celibacy is a generous gift to others and to God, it is meaningless,” said Walsh.\n“If we see celibacy simply as abstaining from sexual intimacy, then it is negative, not life-giving.”\nThere are some married priests within the Catholic Church, though the number is very small.\nThis is the result of a policy change made by Pope John Paul II in 1980, which offered a path for married Episcopal and Anglican priests to continue their ministry after converting to Catholicism.\nIn a statement today, the current Bishop of Killaloe, Bishop Fintan Monahan, remarked that there is a “profound sadness” in the diocese following Walsh’s death.\n“He was dearly loved by the many whose lives he touched in his extraordinary pastoral ministry,” said Monahan.\nMonahan remarked that Walsh’s motto was the “Gentleness of Christ” and that his ministry “radiated that in his care for the poor, pastoral support to survivors of abuse, to anyone who was in trouble, and anyone struggling in life”.",

    "title": "Eleven police officers killed in Pakistan ambush",
    "text": "Pakistan authorities vowed swift revenge after the attack in Rahim Yar Khan district - Rahat Dar/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Armed men ambushed a military convoy in eastern Pakistan on Thursday, killing at least 11 police officers and injuring seven others. Police officials told local media that two vans, carrying more than 20 officers, were trapped in rainwater when the “bandits” launched rockets at them. The convoy came under attack in the Rahim Yar Khan district in a remote area while returning from routine duties aimed at targeting robbers in the region. Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab chief minister, condemned the attack and vowed that it would not go “unavenged”. She said that her team of officials was dispatched with “clear directions to sort them out decisively”. “Sacrifices of police personnel will always be remembered,” she said, instructing the authorities to take immediate action to recover the missing officers. Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan’s prime minister, ordered “immediate and effective action” against those responsible for the attack. Asif Ali Zardari, the country’s president, also condemned it. Murad Ali Shah, the neighbouring Sindh province chief minister, offered support to treat the injured officers. “Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan police should plan a joint operation against dacoits,” he said. “Punjab police are as brave as Sindh police, both have always fought against terrorism and dacoits,” he added. The armed groups in the region have consistently posed challenges to the provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab, despite numerous operations aimed at eradicating them. In April, a review committee of the National Action Plan decided to launch a joint operation by the police forces in the area. Earlier on Thursday, gunmen opened fire on a school bus in the Attock district of the same region, killing two children, according to the police. The attack left five other children wounded on their way to school with some as young as five years old. Police said the attack seemed to be aimed at the driver, who was also injured. Attock district is near Pakistan’s volatile north west where attacks by armed groups have surged in recent years. In 2014, Pakistani Taliban gunmen attacked a military run school in the region, killing nearly 150 children.

    "text": "La fase más terrible de la dana ha pasado ya, tras cobrarse la vida de más de 200 personas , pero la situación adversa continúa durante el fin de semana e incluso el lunes, según advierte la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) . Así, este sábado proseguirá la inestabilidad en el Mediterráneo, con chubascos “de nuevo fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Cataluña, también en la Comunidad Valenciana y en el archipiélago balear que, de forma más débil, se podrán registrar en puntos del tercio sur de la Península”, según pronostica Rubén del Campo, portavoz de Aemet. En el mapa de avisos, Aemet ha levantado el que pesaba desde el viernes sobre Baleares, pero lo ha activado de nuevo en Andalucía. Así, el aviso es naranja, el segundo nivel de una escala de tres, en Cataluña (Tarragona, Girona y Barcelona) y Comunidad Valenciana (Castellón), y amarillo en Andalucía (Granada). En algunas zonas pueden llover a un ritmo de 40 litros por metro cuadrado a la hora y, en otras, llegar a acumularse de 100 en 12 horas. Marivent @DuncanWingen 🎥 pic.twitter.com/o28k1uoJbm A partir del domingo, indica Del Campo “la tendencia es a que la dana poco a poco vaya desapareciendo y a que la situación sea más estable”. La fase más adversa del temporal estaba prevista en un principio hasta el jueves, “pero es normal en situaciones como esta que se alarguen un poco”, explica el experto. Así, el domingo habrá que estar “atentos porque todavía será una nueva jornada con inestabilidad en todo el Mediterráneo, desde Cataluña hasta el Estrecho y Baleares”. Además, en la zona del sur de Tarragona, norte de Castellón y puntos de Teruel, la misma de este viernes, podría haber también tormentas fuertes o con persistencia. Estarán bajo aviso por lluvias Comunidad Valenciana y Cataluña, ambas en amarillo . Andalucía tiene aviso amarillo, pero por mala mar. Los chubascos podrán ser fuertes todavía el lunes, especialmente en el sur de Cataluña, en la Comunidad Valenciana y en el sur de Aragón. De cara al martes y a los días siguientes, probablemente habrá una situación más estable, en todo el país, pero a día de hoy todavía no se pueden descartar posibles chubascos una vez más en el área mediterránea. Las temperaturas estos días “no van a variar demasiado y que serán en general algo más cálidas de lo habitual para esta época del año”. ¿Por qué estás viendo esto?",

    "text": "Mujeres hondureñas conmemoran su día exigiendo justicia y el fin de la violencia machista\nDecenas de mujeres conmemoraron este jueves el Día de la Mujer Hondureña con movilizaciones para reclamar justicia y el fin de la violencia machista en Honduras, donde 380 murieron en 2023, así como la impunidad que rodea esos casos.\nEl color morado en banderas y camisetas predominó durante la jornada en Tegucigalpa, donde participaron organizaciones feministas como la Asociación Calidad de Vida, la Plataforma 25 de Noviembre y el Centro de Derechos de Mujeres (CDM).\nEl principal clamor de las manifestantes en su día fue “justicia” para los casos de feminicidios en Honduras, donde 380 mujeres murieron en 2023 y 16 en los primeros quince días de 2024.\n“Persisten las denuncias por violencia doméstica en todo el país, pero solamente Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula y La Ceiba (centro, norte y Caribe) cuentan con Juzgados Especializados contra la Violencia Doméstica, lo que evidencia la discriminación institucionalizada y la falta de acceso a la justicia para las mujeres”, denunció un grupo de mujeres durante un plantón en la Corte Suprema de Justicia (CSJ).\nLas mujeres pidieron “la urgente” aprobación de la Ley de Casas Refugio, presentada en 2018, para víctimas de la violencia machista en Honduras.\n“No queremos flores, queremos justicia para las mujeres”, “Alto a los feminicidios”, “No quiero ser una cifra”, fueron algunas de las consignas leídas en carteles y mantas que mostraron las manifestantes.\nMedidas urgentes contra violencia de género\nOtro grupo de mujeres se movilizó hacia la parte baja del edificio del Parlamento hondureño, en el centro de Tegucigalpa, para reclamar “medidas urgentes” para erradicar todo tipo de violencia contra ellas.\nLas mujeres merecen “vivir sin miedo a que nos maten, a que nos violen, a que ejerzan violencia política contra nosotras, a sentirnos seguras en nuestras casas y transitar tranquilas por sitios públicos”, señaló la Plataforma 25 de Noviembre, que aglutina a una veintena de organizaciones feministas.\nLos accesos al Parlamento fueron acordonados hoy por decenas de policías por la ceremonia de instalación del tercer período de sesiones de la legislatura 2022-2026, a la que asistió la presidenta hondureña, Xiomara Castro, quien felicitó a las mujeres de su país.\nEl machismo, la indiferencia y el silencio “matan y roban los sueños de las mujeres”, enfatizó la Plataforma 25 de Noviembre, que reclamó la aprobación de la ley Integral en contra de la violencia hacia ellas.\nLas mujeres destacaron que tras 69 años de una de sus conquistas más importantes en la vida política del país: que se les reconociera el derecho a votar en las elecciones generales, siguen “resistiendo”.\nLamentaron además que sigan “siendo víctimas de un patrón de poder patriarcal, capitalista y colonialista” y de un sistema que “explota, tortura, viola, mata, cosifica, ignora y sigue decidiendo sobre los cuerpos y vidas de las mujeres”.\nEl asesinato de mujeres en Honduras ha generado en los últimos días un repudio generalizado en el país y pedidos de varios sectores nacionales e internacionales a combatir la violencia y la impunidad que rodea esos casos.\nLa coordinadora residente de las Naciones Unidas en Honduras, Alice Shackelford, pidió hoy “unir esfuerzos” para eliminar la violencia machista en el país, donde una mujer muere de forma violenta cada 23 horas.\nLa Unión Europea (UE) y sus Estados miembros en Honduras (Alemania, España y Francia) indicaron el miércoles que la violencia de género “se ha acentuado” en el país e instaron a las autoridades a que “la impunidad deje de ser un elemento perpetuador de la violencia de género y atropello a los derechos de las mujeres”. efe",

    "title": "Brendan Carr, Trump's FCC pick, takes aim at Big Tech",
    "text": "The next FCC commissioner wants to end content moderation practices on social media sites David Faris On November 17, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Brendan Carr to chair the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the independent agency that regulates and oversees the nation's communications networks. Carr, who was appointed by Trump as an FCC commissioner in 2017, has been an outspoken critic of content moderation efforts on social media networks like X and Facebook, likening them to censorship regimes, and is expected to target tech giants for regulatory action. A familiar career trajectory Carr has spent virtually his entire life in Washington, D.C. Born in the nation's capital, Carr attended Georgetown University, where he graduated with a BA in Government in 2001. He pursued a legal career by enrolling at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America in D.C. and graduated with a J.D. in 2005. His first job out of law school was at the D.C.-based law firm Wiley Rein , where he specialized in telecommunications law. From 2007 to 2008, he clerked on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals before returning to Wiley Rein. Clerks serve in research, advisory and support roles for judges, and federal clerkships are the most prestigious of such posts in the legal world. That's because \"from a purely resumé-enhancing perspective, a clerkship also bestows upon a newer attorney a stamp of approval that opens doors to opportunities at prestigious law firms and government agencies and in academia,\" said the Federal Bar Association in a 2020 blog post. Trump picked Carr for a five-year term on the FCC in 2017, and because he has already been confirmed by the Senate, he requires no further action to move into the role of chair. President Biden renominated Carr as a commissioner in 2023. If that seems puzzling, it is because no more than three commissioners can be members of the same political party.

Carr's agenda Carr wrote a chapter of the Heritage Foundation's much-discussed Project 2025 manual called \"Mandate For Leadership: The Conservative Promise.\" In Chapter 28 , titled \"Federal Communications Commission,\" Carr recommends that the FCC should take aim at \"big tech\" and rein in some of its alleged abuses. He also recommends that the FCC stop interpreting Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act as conferring limitless immunity on media platforms for the content that they carry. Carr additionally believes that companies like Meta are suppressing conservative speech . \"We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans,\" Carr said in a post on X the day he was nominated to chair the FCC. Not everyone believes that it will be that easy. \"I don't believe the FCC has the authority to do this,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich to Roll Call , referring to Project 2025's Section 230 reforms. Congress should \"empower consumers to choose their own content filters and fact checkers, if any,\" Carr said in his Project 2025 manual. Carr also thinks that the FCC should ban the social media platform TikTok and expand its \" Covered List \" of companies that should be prohibited from doing business in the U.S. for national security reasons. In addition, Carr has criticized the Biden administration for rejecting a bid to use federal subsidies to expand broadband access through Trump-aligned billionaire Elon Musk's Starlink platform. Carr applauded Musk's controversial 2022 acquisition of Twitter and is expected to deliver federal grants to the tech mogul. Carr is also planning to change the agency's internal practices. \"Starting next year, the FCC will end its promotion of DEI,\" Carr said in a post https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1858364209626521911. Carr's appointment was met with criticism from the left. \"Brendan Carr has been campaigning for this job with promises to do the bidding of Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\" said Free Press Action co-CEO Craig Aaron to The Washington Post. But his fellow FCC commissioners welcomed the news. \"Commissioner Carr is a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today,\" said Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starks in a statement . Elon Musk congratulated Carr https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1858312453752328590 immediately after his appointment was announced.
