    "title": "If you have lost a loved one to suicide, you are not alone",
    "text": "If you are a Catholic grieving the complicated loss of a loved one to suicide, you are not alone. “My hope and desire is that those who have experienced suicide loss know that they are not alone. God has not abandoned them, their families, or their loved one who died, and the members of Holy Mother Church walk with them as they grieve,” said Sr. Kathryn Maney, M.S., in an interview with Aleteia. Sr. Kathryn knows this journey personally, and she is the founder of [Remember](https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/remember-new-ministry-serves-catholics), the first ministry created specifically to serve Catholics grieving a suicide loss. When she lost her sister Clare to suicide, Sr. Kathryn found herself in a difficult situation. She craved support for herself and her family but found that the options available did not meet her needs as a practicing Catholic. First she participated in a secular group, but found that it felt short: “It was very helpful, but also limited because it did not address the whole person, body and soul.” She later tried a Catholic-sponsored group but found it less helpful. “Prayer was not regularly mentioned or included, and the program director encouraged ‘helps’ that are actually contrary to the faith, like consultation of mediums,” she said. “I was disheartened to say the least.” This discouragement became the inspiration for her ministry. “My spiritual director suggested that I work to start something,” she recalled. “I prayed about it and strove to let God lead the way. He has provided, and many persons have generously come forward in the process to make Remember possible.” Concluding the first pilot program Remember is still in very early stages. The pilot program for 12 weeks of group meetings will conclude in May 2024. Sr. Kathryn worked closely with Dr. Matthew Breuninger, a [professor](https://shss.franciscan.edu/faculty/breuninger-matthew/) of psychology at Franciscan University of Steubenville, to develop it. He co-authored materials, helped outline the 12-week program, and has been very instrumental in the development of Remember. “When the participants have completed their evaluations, we’ll edit the materials, finalize the leaders’ guide and journals and hope to publish materials after a copyright is obtained,” Sr. Kathryn said. At that point, the website will be finalized and training can begin for leaders to offer Remember in their parishes. A blessing in the process has been that Remember now operates under the umbrella of Red Bird Ministries, a Catholic organization that systematically guides individuals and couples through the complexity and drama that happens with a loss. Red Bird Ministries already has many offerings for parents who have experienced the death of a child, such as retreats, comfort calls, a phone app, webinars, online groups for Lent, and more, so working with them has simplified the process for Sr. Kathryn to develop Remember. “I would absolutely recommend this group” A participant in the pilot program, Judine, shared her experience with Aleteia. “Before Remember, I had not found any grief support group, especially with regard to suicide,” she said. “Being able to walk alongside others who have experienced a similar trauma was a gift. I didn’t know how much it would help to be with a group like this. I think the Holy Spirit was helping out a lot, and I would absolutely recommend this group to anyone with no hesitation.” Sr. Kathryn found that, in her experience, those suffering from the complicated grief associated with suicide loss need human helps as well as the grace that comes from prayer and the Sacraments. She designed the Remember program with all this in mind: The first half of Remember focuses on the psychological tools that aid a person who is grieving, while the second half focuses on Church teaching, forgiveness, and Ignatian prayer in order to allow participants to intentionally bring their experience of suicide loss to the Lord in prayer. There’s no other grief program quite like it. Wisdom for those grieving Several years into it, and having worked with others mourning a suicide loss, Sr. Kathryn understands the distinct nature of this grief. She offered the following advice for anyone who has lost a family member or friend to suicide: - “Be very honest with God in prayer. Tell Him everything that you are experiencing and allow Him to speak to you in your pain and sadness.” - “Seek consolation and refuge in the Sacraments and Eucharistic adoration.” - “Find a faithful, trusted individual who is willing and able to listen to you and hear your story of loss. A faithful Catholic therapist and a spiritual director are very helpful.” - “Remember that because ‘Life is changed, not ended,’ you still have a relationship with the one who has died. Find ways to maintain that connection.” While Remember is a Catholic program through and through, anyone is welcome to participate. At the same time, Sr. Kathryn pointed out that this is not the only step that will be needed along the way of healing. But as the first and only Catholic program serving people in this specific situation, Remember meets a huge need. Anyone interested in participating in a “Remember” group, or bringing Red Bird ministries to their local diocese or parish, can find more information at [Red Bird’s website](https://www.redbird.love/remember-donation).",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. is emailing Hong Kong users to raise concerns about rules the city is formulating, warning the government could cap the number of drivers or vehicles allowed on the platform.\nThe San Francisco-based company said any such limit would reduce opportunities for drivers to earn money and could lead to more cancellations and longer wait times, according to the emails, which are being sent to 30,000 Uber drivers and 1.5 million people in the city who have used the service in the last year.\nHong Kong is expected to release new ride-hailing regulations in the coming months after last year outlining long-awaited but ambiguous plans to regulate the industry. Those plans included imposing licenses on platforms and adopting tougher penalties for rule breaking.\nThe Hong Kong government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nUber has become a popular alternative to the city’s local taxi services, which have for years drawn the ire of residents and tourists alike.\nThe company launched in Hong Kong in 2014 and seven years later acquired the HKTaxi app, a widely used platform for hiring cabs. Uber offers traditional ride-hailing and services such as Uber Taxi, which allows users to book local taxis through the firm’s own app.\nHong Kong taxi drivers in 2023 threatened to go on strike to protest the government’s unwillingness to regulate ride-hailing services. Uber’s presence has made it a target of Hong Kong’s taxi industry, which says Uber deprives it of revenue each day and creates unfair competition.\nIn March, Uber suggested regulatory measures such as ensuring platforms be licensed and have safety measures and insurance in place, and that drivers be licensed and pass background checks.\nUber’s general manager for Hong Kong, Estyn Chung, said people in the city value ride-sharing.\n“We hope the government is considering a regulatory framework that prioritizes safety, meets the needs of riders and drivers, and enables ride-sharing and taxis to grow side by side,” he said.\nIn the US, Uber and rival Lyft Inc. have sent emails and used their apps to communicate with drivers and riders about proposed rules in various states and cities.\nMeanwhile, Uber may soon face increased competition in the city from China’s Didi Global Inc., which has been quietly recruiting new drivers in Hong Kong as it looks to grow outside of the mainland.\n--With assistance from Natalie Lung.\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nCatch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
