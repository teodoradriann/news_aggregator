    "text": "The Gavino family, while on vacation in the North Carolina mountains, used an Apple AirTag to track down their stolen luggage and the suspect. [Daniel Pierce for Queen City News](https://www.qcnews.com/news/u-s/north-carolina/gaston-county/i-wanted-justice-airtags-used-to-track-stolen-luggage-from-charlotte-airport-to-suspects-home/): “I wanted justice,” Catherine Gavino told Queen City News in an exclusive interview Tuesday afternoon. Friday afternoon, the family landed at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. However, their vacation was delayed when they were unable to locate one of their bags at baggage claim… Gavino pulled up her phone to check the location of her newly bought AirTag… “It was to help find luggage if it was lost, but I never thought it’d get stolen,” she said. Stolen is what happened, according to a Gastonia Police Department police report. When Gavino pulled up her phone, the AirTag hidden inside her mother and father’s luggage showed it was on Interstate 85 and on its way west toward Gastonia. Gavino not only found the house but saw the AirTag was still at the location. She contacted the police who arrived and notified the homeowners of the situation. Inside, they found the family’s suitcase and the suitcase of another victim whose luggage was also stolen from the airport. MacDailyNews Take: According to the [Gastonia Police report](https://tepsweb.cityofgastonia.com/caserecords/shared/default.aspx), the suspect was arrested and charged with multiple charges of theft along with a drug charge. The suspect is being held on a $10,000 bond. The Apple AirTag was also recovered. Please help support MacDailyNews.

    "text": "Dense rebuilding would put many more at risk\nPresident Trump, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass rarely are unanimous on anything. But all three have taken steps toward allowing victims of the January firestorms in Los Angeles County to rebuild their communities essentially as they were before.\nPresident Trump, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass rarely are unanimous on anything. But all three have taken steps toward allowing victims of the January firestorms in Los Angeles County to rebuild their communities essentially as they were before.\nIn both places, this would mean large quantities of single family housing and few multi-family apartment and condominium buildings.\nBut the seemingly innocuous aims announced by these leading politicians may soon run afoul of housing density factors playing no role in rebuilding that’s followed other major California blazes. Some of these were the 2018 Camp fire that leveled Paradise, the Tubbs fire covering parts of Napa, Sonoma and Lake counties in 2017 and the 2018 Woolsey fire that destroyed a large swath of Malibu.\nThe new factors include recent state and local laws demanding vastly increased density in new housing and a plethora of low- and middle-income units.\nIn the modern era, no other event has created nearly as much newly buildable land as the January infernos, which turned more than 16,000 structures to ash.\nA clear majority of former residents in both Altadena and the Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles want to rebuild their communities much as they were pre-fire.\nBut laws adopted since the previous huge burns demand both density and economic diversity. Newsom could suspend some of those laws if he chooses, just as he exempted properties leveled by the Palisades fire, which also decimated many extremely pricey Malibu homes, from normal coastal zone regulations. He has not done that.\nHere's one basic reality the recent laws don’t recognize: If density increases in burn footprints, the number of prospective victims in the inevitable future fires there will also leap.\nSome planners are already saying there should be less development, not more, in these areas because of their histories of repeated fires. The recent laws don’t figure this in.\nFor example, two 2021 state laws known SB 9 and SB 10 allow developers to erect three-story buildings along all major thoroughfares, regardless of locale. Permits for such construction are nearly automatic under the rules. They can sometimes rise as high as eight floors.\nBut the most important street in Pacific Palisades, the storied Sunset Boulevard, previously had virtually no buildings of more than two floors in the Palisades. Higher-rise structures might enable more economic diversity, but would also put many more residents at risk.\nYet, there’s little or nothing about risk in the one-size-fits-all laws that whizzed to passage.\nMeanwhile, city ordinances in Los Angeles and other places go at density differently, focusing on economics. One local law dictates that all units in buildings put up before 1978 would need to be replaced with units “affordable” to low-income renters even if previous tenants had high incomes.\nAnother law, governing post-1978 structures, would require that landlords prove all pre-fire tenants were high income. If they can’t, new units could only be built if they’re affordable for extremely low income, very low income or low income households in direct proportion to city-wide percentages in those economic categories.\nThis might let some household cleaners and gardeners live much closer to work than before, but would also put many more people at risk in a place of frequent fires.\nThe new residents would fall into economic classes below nearby neighbors planning to rebuild in single-family zones. That is, unless developers buy up significant numbers of suddenly vacant lots and build up to six units on each, where there was previously just one home. That’s also permitted almost automatically by recent state laws.\nOn the other hand, few previously-burned communities have had as many residents with access to political, financial and cultural power as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, power that may be used to resist the new laws.\nAll of which means rebuilding these two communities may prove far more complex both financially and morally than after previous fires, where recent laws did not apply.\nLegislators and local officials could change some of this and let the stricken communities try to recapture their former character. But how likely is that when many lawmakers were elected on platforms demanding ever more housing density and diversity?\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.

Former WWE Women's Champion says she likes Bianca Belair's husband Montez Ford Discuss Now Bianca Belair (left), Montez Ford (right) [Image credits: WWE.com] Bianca Belair and Montez Ford's latest video caught the attention of former WWE Women's Champion Nia Jax. Belair and Jax have a lot of history with each other.\nAd Belair also played a crucial role when Jax lost the Women's Championship to Tiffany Stratton on the January 3, 2025 edition of SmackDown. The EST hit the former champion with the KOD, allowing Stratton to pick up the pieces and successfully cash in her Money in the Bank contract.\nOn Instagram, Jax reacted to Belair's video with Ford, stating that she liked The EST's husband but wasn't a fan of her.\n\"I like tez! You… psshhh 🙄,\" wrote Jax. Ad Trending Check out a screengrab of Jax's Instagram comment:\nExpand Tweet Ad Magnum T.A. hates the idea of Rhea Ripley forcing herself into the Bianca Belair-IYO SKY rivalry Rhea Ripley signed the contract for the WWE Women's World Championship set between IYO SKY and Bianca Belair . Originally, SKY was set to defend her newly won title against Belair, but the former champion once again interrupted the champion and her challenger on RAW.\nAd Speaking on the Straight Talk with The Boss podcast, Magnum T.A. explained why he doesn't like the idea of someone forcing themselves into a match from a storyline perspective. He said :\n\"I'm a huge fan of Rhea Ripley. I don't like the idea that anybody from a storyline perspective can just, you know, bully their way into the deal. And, you know, she put her name on the contract. Well, that didn't mean nothing. I mean, the contract is made up between the other two individuals. So, I think the storyline there has got some flaws in it because it really, I mean, there's nobody would be able to hold anybody's feet to the fire. Anybody could come up and say I'm gonna write my name on the piece of paper and be in the match.\" Bianca Belair, IYO SKY, and Rhea Ripley were involved in a huge brawl on RAW. The WrestleMania 41 match between Belair and SKY is yet to be converted to a Triple Threat Match.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

At Varanasi Airport, 50% of the flights were cancelled for the past 2 days.\nDue to dense fog train services were mostly affected with trains running late for more than 5 to 10 hours. Several VVIP trains like Vande Bharat, Shatabadi and Tejas were cancelled.\nTraffic on the road was also affected as the UP government bus was off-road during peak fog hours.\nThe Meteorological Department has issued a cold day alert for Friday in 29 districts and surrounding areas of the state.
