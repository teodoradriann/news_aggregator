This is lower than our typical highs in the low 40s this time of year. Overnight temps are still dangerously cold.\nMonday will be a few degrees colder as highs will be in the lower 20s, but the sub-zero readings are in the past. There may be some decent sunshine Monday afternoon.\nWe aren’t getting over the freezing mark until Tuesday. Moving into that day, conditions will be dry. As we move throughout the day, we can expect increasing clouds and more snow Tuesday night into Wednesday. This should be a quick round of snow unlike yesterday’s.\nTemps will reach the upper 30s and low 40s next week.\nKeep an eye on the Red Banner at the top of the page for updates on the winter weather watches, warnings and advisories as they update periodically during an event like this one.\nHave a great rest of your day and stay warm!\nDon’t forget to download the KTVZ Local Alert Weather App to stay safe and informed\niOS:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/ktvz-local-alert-weather-app/id1088330817\nAndroid:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ktvz.android.weather&hl=en_US",

According to the UK Maritime Trade Operations, MV Sounion, a Greek-flagged oil tanker, and SW North Wind I, a Panama-flagged commercial vessel, were both attacked on Wednesday. The UK Maritime Trade Operations also confirmed that MV Sounion, which was hit multiple times, has lost engine power and all crew members have been rescued.

The mission urged vessels in the area to \"exercise caution and avoid actions that could worsen the situation.\" SW North Wind I, a 15-year-old bulk carrier, was navigating the southern Red Sea when the attack occurred. The ship sustained damage to its hull from the strike, but all crew members were unharmed, according to a Yemeni coast guard official. The attacks come amid ongoing regional tensions.

    "text": "RICHMOND — The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) on Thursday announced the state’s first reported influenza-associated pediatric death for the 2023-24 flu season. \"Sadly, a child (5-12 years old) in Virginia’s Eastern region died from complications associated with influenza (flu),\" according to a VDH media release. \"To protect the family’s privacy, VDH will not provide any further information regarding this death.\" “We at the Virginia Department of Health, are broken-hearted and extend our sympathies to the family of this child during this difficult time,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton. “Even though the flu is common, it can cause serious illness and even death. I urge everyone who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine to do so not only to protect themselves, but to protect those around them.” VDH recommends taking three actions to prevent the flu: • Everyone six months and older should receive a yearly flu vaccine, consulting your healthcare provider as needed. • Practice good preventive health with hand hygiene (washing your hands regularly with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer), respiratory etiquette (coughing and sneezing into a tissue or the inside of your elbow rather than your open hand), and staying home when you feel sick; and • If you do become sick with the flu, seek healthcare early in your illness if necessary. Antivirals prescribed by a healthcare provider are a treatment option for some patients and can help prevent serious flu complications. Influenza activity is elevated and is expected to increase in Virginia as the weather becomes colder, according to the media release. For the week ending Dec. 23, emergency department and urgent care visits due to flu-like illness are very high (6.9% of total visits), especially among young children and school-aged children (14.7% and 13.2% of visits, respectively). \"The 2023-24 flu season in Virginia is anticipated to be in the typical range of severity,\" the release states. \"However, even typical seasons vary widely and result in illness, hospitalizations, and death. Virginia reported five influenza-associated deaths among children during the 2022-23 flu season.\" Virginia vaccination coverage for flu remains low for children and adults, the release adds. The percent of eligible Virginians reporting receipt of a flu vaccine this season is only 27%. \"With flu activity increasing in Virginia, now is still a good time to get a flu vaccine if you have not already,\" the release states. To locate a seasonal flu vaccine near you, you can visit [www.vaccinate.virginia.gov](http://www.vaccinate.virginia.gov) or contact your local health department. For further information, call 804-864-8141.",

    "text": "The weather is expected to remain unsettled with strong winds, heavy rain and ‘close to freezing’ conditions throughout the last weekend of 2023. New Year’s Eve revellers have been urged to wrap up warm as conditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing as the clock strikes midnight. The weather is expected to remain unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain throughout the last weekend of 2023. A yellow weather warning for wind covering parts of Wales and the east of England has been issued and will come into force between 11am on Saturday and 3am on Sunday. A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services, the Met Office said. A yellow weather warning for rain has been issued covering Wales between 10am and 6pm on Saturday, which may lead to flooding and transport disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain will also come into effect at 4am on Saturday for Northern Ireland, due to be in force until 11am the same day. The fresh warnings come on the heels of a gusty few days brought on by Storm Gerrit. Hundreds of homes in Scotland reman without power as the post-storm clean up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties will be reconnected on Friday. Thousands of properties in Ceredigion were without power on Thursday after lightning struck supplies in Wales. The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm – Storm Hank – as a “deep area of low pressure” pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday. Meteorologist Alex Burkill said Saturday is going to turn “wet and windy” across the UK with a band of “intense rain” pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly “severe gales” in exposed spots. In a forecast video, Mr Burkill said northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see “significant snow”, with possibly 10 to 20cm of snow building up on the highest grounds. “There’s a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we’ve seen over some recent days,” he said. Blustery and showery conditions are set to continue into Sunday, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall across western parts of the UK. The mercury is expected to drop on Sunday. Mr Burkill said: “As we look towards the end of the day on New Year’s Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight. “So perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies but do watch out for those showers and you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn’t been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it’s going to feel close to freezing for many places. “So definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.” New Year’s Day should turn drier for many, particularly across more central southern parts of England and across Scotland with the “central slice” of the UK most likely to have showery rain. “As we look through the rest of the first week of 2024 and at the moment Tuesday looks like it’d be a largely dry day with some fine weather around before the return to something more unsettled – some heavy rain, some strong winds, and that does bring the potential for something a little bit colder and possibly wintry,” Mr Burkill said. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A “supercell thunderstorm” that moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged around 100 homes in Stalybridge, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspended or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.",

    "text": "Pope Francis has moved to officially integrate freemasonry into the Catholic Church, heralding an “evolution in mutual understanding” between the Vatican and the secretive organization. Freemasonry is the world’s oldest secret religion with Luciferian plans to usher in a New World Order. While the penalty for renouncing Freemasonry is death, insiders have [revealed](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/insider-exposes-freemasonry-as-worlds-oldest-secret-religion-and-the-luciferian-plans-for-a-new-world-order/) that almost every notable person running the world today, from politics to business to entertainment, got there through masonry. BYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. You can unsubscribe any time. By subscribing you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/website-terms-of-use/) Despite the Luciferian links, a cardinal taking part in a “historic” closed-door meeting on Friday between the heads of Italy’s Freemasonic lodges and senior Catholic Church leaders called for an official permanent dialogue to be opened with the secretive organization, despite masonry being long condemned by the Church. NCRegister [reports](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/pentin-cardinal-calls-for-permanent-dialogue-with-freemasons): A 1983 [document](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19831126_declaration-masonic_en.html) from the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith stated Masonic principles “have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church.” And last November, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith reaffirmed that stance, quoting the 1983 document that “active membership in Freemasonry by a member of the faithful is prohibited, because of the irreconcilability between Catholic doctrine and Freemasonry.” So why is Pope Francis’s Vatican welcoming Freemasons into the fold? Addressing the Milan [meeting on the theme The Catholic Church and Freemasonry](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/archbishohp-delpini-freemasonry-seminar), Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmiero, 85, reportedly said he believed a new era of understanding had been reached between masonry and the Church in recent times. “Things have moved on, and I hope these meetings don’t stop there,” said the retired Italian prelate, according to [Il Messaggero](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/chiesa-massoneria-card-coccopalmerio-tavolo-permanente-di-dialogo-incontro-col-grande-oriente-a-milano/2664898/), quoting sources present at the meeting that was closed to the press. According to sources who spoke with [La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana](https://newdailycompass.com/en/freemasonry-wants-a-mea-culpa-catholic-church-commits-examination-of-conscience), all three grand masters of the Italian lodges — Stefano Bisi of the Grand Orient of Italy, Luciano Romoli of the Grand Lodge of Italy, and Fabio Venzi of the Grand Regular Lodge of Italy — addressed the meeting. Two of them made their speeches public. “With different nuances, all defended the compatibility of Freemasonry with the Catholic faith,” reported La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana’s editor-in-chief, Riccardo Cascioli, who also spoke with people who attended the meeting at the Ambrosianeum Cultural Foundation.

    "text": "What better way for unelected globalists to seize more land and water to power their data centers than to put prices on everything in nature? perspective Data centers are likely to be built on “prime agricultural land” and will require “a whole lot of water” and energy systems to maintain, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) panel.\nSpeaking at the WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, aka “Summer Davos,” in Dalian China on Wednesday during a session called “ Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2024 ” Australian National University School of Cybernetics director Katherine Daniell said that with new technologies comes new responsibilities, ethical considerations, and educational opportunities to help scientists, corporations, and startups become aware of the complex systems that go into these emerging technologies, so that they may act responsibly.\n“If we’re going to develop new data centers, they’re likely to go in prime agricultural land; they’re likely to require a whole lot of water, energy systems”\nKatherine Daniell, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, 2024 \"If we're going to develop new DATA CENTERS, they're likely to go in PRIME AGRICULTURAL LAND. They're likely to require a whole lot of WATER & ENERGY SYSTEMS\" Katherine Daniell, WEF #AMNC24 Summer Davos pic.twitter.com/R5dwa0BvBA\n— Tim Hinchliffe (@TimHinchliffe) June 27, 2024 “ One of the really important things is helping the scientists and the people creating these technologies to act responsibly while they’re developing them ,” said Daniell.\n“ A lot of that comes back to the education systems on how people are aware of the technologies in that complex systems context .\n“ If we’re going to develop new data centers, they’re likely to go in prime agricultural land; they’re likely to require a whole lot of water, energy systems .\n“ How are we developing these really complex, connected systems, and how are we helping the startup founders in their decisions every day to make very small adjustments, for example in their algorithms and in other things that can make a really big difference to the overall situation ,” she added.\nIf you’ve ever wondered why unelected globalists like Bill Gates are buying up huge swaths of farmland, or why they want to sell you fake meat , put prices on water and everything in nature , and have you dependent on intermittent renewables while they push nuclear for themselves, this may be one of the reasons.\nThe amount of land, water, energy, and investments needed to build data centers is enormous. Demand is only expected to grow.\nSpeaking at the WEF “ Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy Development ” in April, BlackRock CEO and WEF Board of Trustees member Larry Fink told a panel on “ Investing Amid Global Fracture ,” that in order to build out AI data centers, it will take trillions of dollars of investing and reliable energy sources that aren’t intermittent like wind or solar.\n“To power these data companies you cannot have just this intermittent power like wind and solar; you need dispatchable power because you can’t turn off and on these data centers”\nLarry Fink, WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy Development, 2024 At the WEF, Larry Fink ironically destroys net-zero when it comes to the power needed for AI: \"By 2030 [data centers] need 30 gigawatts.. Where's that power gonna come from? To power these data companies you can't have intermittent power like wind & solar\" https://t.co/Cy4dU1Av9a pic.twitter.com/8Ymy53xgRx\n— Tim Hinchliffe (@TimHinchliffe) April 29, 2024 “ I do believe to properly build-out AI, we’re talking about trillions of dollars of investing ,” said Fink.\n“Data centers today can be as much as 200 megahertz [sic] — they’re now talking about data centers that are going to be one gigawatt — that powers a city.\n“ There’s one tech company that I spoke to the CEO last week who said, ‘Right now with all their data centers is about five gigawatts; by 2030 they need 30 gigawatts .’\n“Thirty! the amount of power that’s needed to use AI has huge impact on society.\n“ Where’s that power going to come from? Are we going to take it off the grid? What does it mean for elevated energy prices for everybody else if it’s that?\n“I think it’s going to represent some huge societal questions that we have not addressed — the negative side — forget about the use of it, but just the generation of it is massive power. That’s a huge investment opportunity.\n“ The world is going to be short power, short power! And to power these data companies you cannot have just this intermittent power like wind and solar; you need dispatchable power because you can’t turn off and on these data centers .”\nIf wind and solar can’t power these data centers that are going to built on prime agricultural land, what type of power could be used?\nIn a word, nuclear.\nAt another session of the WEF’s special meeting last April entitled “ The Role of New Nuclear ,” Axiom Space Executive Chairman Kam Ghaffarian said that nuclear was the way forward.\n“ The amount of power these data centers need […] If we’re not going to use the fossil fuel — of course we need renewables — but how are we going to solve the problem? Then, you come to this solution that, OK, nuclear”\nKam Ghaffarian, WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy Development, 2024 Looks like we're going Nuclear to power AI: \"All of the energy formulas that we've been thinking about we've got to throw them out the door.. How are we gonna solve the problem? Ok, nuclear\" Axiom Space Executive Chairman Kam Ghaffarian to the WEF https://t.co/4yaXBmes9i pic.twitter.com/xCe5zsz274\n— Tim Hinchliffe (@TimHinchliffe) April 30, 2024 “ The amount of power these data centers need — I mean I was just talking to a hyper-scaler recently at their conference, and they’re going to need like 10 gigawatts of power by 2030 ,” said Ghaffarian.\n“ All the energy formulas that we’ve been thinking about we’ve got to throw out the door, and sort of say how are we going to meet the energy need ?\n“ If we’re not going to use the fossil fuel — of course we need renewables — but how are we going to solve the problem?\n“ Then, you come to this solution that, OK, nuclear .”\nWhile the unelected globalists push for wind and solar for the common folk, they are simultaneously pushing nuclear for themselves.\nAnd whether it’s miles of wind turbines and solar panels across the landscape, or hectares of nuclear power plants and data centers, they all need significant amounts of prime agricultural land and water to operate.\nSpeaking of water, back at the Summer Davos in China on Wednesday, University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership CEO Lindsay Hooper told the panel on “ Understanding Nature’s Ledger ” that “ every part of the economy is fundamentally dependent on nature ,” including, “ the air that we breathe, the water we drink, the soil, the oceans that we need for the food that we need to consume, the minerals that we need as inputs to technology and into infrastructure .”\n“ Nature is treated within the economy as though it’s unlimited, and predominantly as though it’s free”\nLindsay Hooper, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, 2024 \"We can't do business on a dead planet. If we're going to protect natural systems, one of the solutions is to bring nature onto the balance sheet; bring nature into the ways that decisions are made within business to allocate a value to it\" Lindsay Hooper WEF #AMNC Summer Davos pic.twitter.com/Y1dpjMgmS6\n— Tim Hinchliffe (@TimHinchliffe) June 27, 2024 In order to protect natural systems like water, Hooper said that “ one of the solutions is to bring nature onto the balance sheet; bring nature into the ways that decisions are made within business to allocate a value to it — to bring it into accounting and financial mechanisms .”\nIn addition to putting “nature on the balance sheet,” another proposal coming at the end of the panel discussion suggested putting a tax on natural systems like water in the same vein as carbon taxes.\n“ Beyond carbon [taxes] let’s think about other aspects of nature that are easier to quantify […] What about water?”\nGim Huay Neo, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, 2024 \"Beyond carbon [taxes] let's think about other aspects of nature that are easier to quantify.. What about water? That's quite possible for us to start integrating systematically into current trading carbon pricing mechanisms\" WEF managing director Gim Neo #AMNC24 Summer Davos pic.twitter.com/0rlomVk3ph\n— Tim Hinchliffe (@TimHinchliffe) June 27, 2024 In her presentation, WEF managing director for nature and climate Gim Huay Neo said that “integrating natural capital to our accounting framework” should happen soon, stating:\n“ Today, carbon pricing, ETS [Emissions Trading Systems], carbon taxes really cover about 25 percent of global emissions .\n“We should actually look at scaling this to cover all 100 percent of carbon emissions.\n“ And beyond carbon let’s think about other aspects of nature that are easier to quantify .\n“We will probably not be able to quantify everything on day one, but what about water ?\n“ That’s quite possible for us to start integrating systematically into current trading carbon pricing mechanisms .”\nWhat better way for the unelected globalists to seize more land, water, and other natural resources to power their data centers than to put prices on everything in nature?",

    "text": "En 1948 las milicias israelíes escondían armas en escuelas, hospitales y edificios religiosos. Así se fundó Israel...\n¿Has visto alguna vez esos carteles por todo Israel que dicen que las primeras milicias sionistas utilizaban escuelas, hospitales y edificios religiosos para esconder armas y entrenar a las milicias?\nPara contextualizar un poco, el supuesto uso de infraestructura civil por parte de Hamás para funciones militares ha sido un tema controvertido a lo largo de esta guerra. Tales afirmaciones se utilizan para justificar el bombardeo mortal e indiscriminado de Israel sobre Gaza, pero los grupos paramilitares sionistas en realidad utilizaron infraestructura civil para fines militares antes de su establecimiento del estado de Israel, y más de 70 años después, no lo ocultan. Y parece que siguen estando orgullosos de ello porque hay carteles y placas por todas partes en algunas comunidades israelíes. Como este escondite secreto de armas en el sótano y el ático de la Sinagoga que el Ayuntamiento de Tel Aviv todavia conmemora convenientemente con este cartel en hebreo e inglés, y el edificio de la Escuela Bialik en Netanya que tiene un cartel que dice: \"En la escuela tuvo lugar el entrenamiento de varios movimientos clandestinos. Una gruta en la escuela se utilizaba como escondite para las armas\". Otra escuela de Tel Aviv funcionó como centro de entrenamiento en armas ligeras y como depósito de armas para la milicia sionista Hagana. Y luego está este edificio, que también albergó el Hospital Conmemorativo de las Milicias Sionistas. Y este otro edificio, que también albergaba el Hospital Conmemorativo de los grupos de milicias sionistas que utilizaban el edificio como cuartel general con este cartel. Ese grupo de milicias sionistas era el Etzel, también conocido como el Irgun y por llevar a cabo múltiples masacres de palestinos en 1948. Fue declarado como grupo terrorista y cuyo logotipo incluía a Jordania como parte de Israel. Y el cartel en el exterior de esta sinagoga en un barrio de Tel Aviv que dice: \"Bajo la escalera, que conduce a la sección de mujeres, había un depósito secreto de armas ilegales de la Hagana durante el dominio británico\". También tenemos este otro cartel en el exterior de la Central Eléctrica de Reading, en Tel Aviv, que albergaba la oficina técnica de la Ta'as, la industria militar fundada por la Hagana, una de las muchas instalaciones armamentísticas clandestinas que utilizaban las máquinas y el equipo del edificio para ocultar la fabrica de armas. Y luego están los gimnasios de la Escuela Secundaria Balfour y la escuela Ahad Ha'am para chicos en Tel Aviv, que se utilizaban como lugares de entrenamiento para la Hagana y que también albergaban depósitos secretos de armas. Y esto sigue y sigue, así que aquí hay algunas cosas a tener en cuenta cuando Israel acusa a Hamás de las mismas cosas que él hizo. Estas milicias fueron consideradas organizaciones terroristas que mataron a palestinos para establecer el Estado de Israel en 1948. Y esos mismos grupos del ejército \"pre-estado\" pasaron a formar las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel, también conocidas como IDF.\nAquí la colección de placas:\nhttps://www.streetsigns.co.il/doSearch.asp?searchFor=%401%40",

    "text": "How hard would you work to avoid a flag?\nBy Josh Wilson | 5:41 PM EST\nNew York Giants v Philadelphia Eagles / Adam Hunger/GettyImages\nOne of the worst penalties you can draw in football is roughing the kicker. It's a personal foul, so it results in 15 yards from the previous spot and an automatic first down for the kicking team. That means, if a team was punting it away, you go from your offense coming on the field to handing the opposition a fresh set of downs.\nSuffice it to say that it's one of the most desirable penalties to avoid. Giants linebacker and special teams player Cam Brown definitely gets that. Having bumped into Eagles punter Braden Mann, Brown caught Mann after he knocked him off balance to keep him from hitting the ground.\nThe way the rule is written, the kicker needs to hit the turf for it to be roughing the passer after contacted by the defender. If he stays upright, no penalty.\nHilarious avoidance of roughing the kicker from Cam Brown It resulted in a hilariously awkward several seconds where Mann tried to use his body weight to go down and Brown walked with him doing whatever he could to keep him up. Eventually, Brown won and got him on his feet and avoided the flag.\nEagles punter tried to flop and Cam Brown held him up so he couldn't do the dance ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/jY7JEhTouq\nâ€” Alex Wilson (@AlexWilsonESM) January 7, 2024 A pretty high-IQ play from both players that resulted in an oh-so-hilarious moment. The Eagles need to win to keep thieir NFC East title hopes alive -- but will hit the playoff picture regardless -- and are down 24-0 as of this writing closing in on halftime.\nfeed\nRelated Topics NFL News New York Giants Philadelphia Eagles Home / Philadelphia Eagles",

    "text": "Endesa y Espacio Zity se unen para lograr un festival 100% sostenible La compañía eléctrica abastecerá al recinto de energía renovable, añadiendo además puntos de reciclaje en varias zonas Monográficos La cuenta atrás para el inicio del Pilar ha llegado a su fin. Este viernes, 4 de octubre, comienza la programación del Espacio Zity, con la fiesta Love the 90. Serán 9 días en los que miles y miles de personas pasarán por el espacio situado en Valdespartera. Y al igual que las fiestas del año pasado, el objetivo es que este festival sea más sostenible. [Endesa](https://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/tags/endesa/) se incorporó en 2023 como patrocinador del Espacio Zity y este año mantiene su apoyo. De hecho, esta será la primera edición en la que la energía eléctrica será 100% renovable. Sonará la [música](https://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/tags/musica/) de Saiko, de La Oreja de Van Gogh, de Steve Aoki, Sebastián Yatra, Arde Bogotá, y otros muchos, sin olvidar las sesiones de humor y las nocturnas. Pero además de diversión, el respeto mediambiental también será protagonista. La compañía comenzó con los patrocinios musicales hace ya tres años, y este repite en el Zity, ya que es un festival de referencia, es «un partner perfecto», aseguran fuentes de Endesa, que se celebra en unas fechas muy importantes para [Zaragoza](https://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/tags/zaragoza/) y Aragón, como son las [Fiestas del Pilar](https://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/fiestas-del-pilar/). Unos días en los que Valdespartera se convierte en el centro de la diversión y sus organizadores también muestran su inquietud por reducir su huella de carbono, por lo que «la alianza es perfecta». Y es que más allá de la imagen de marca, Endesa lleva todo el año trabajando para que el festival sea más sostenible. Y lo han hecho en torno a tres ejes. El primero está relacionado con la energía eléctrica que consume el festival, sin la cual la música no sonaría con toda su fuerza, que este año es 100% renovable (el año pasado fue el 70%). Pero hay más; y es que se seguirá compensando todo el C02 que se produzca a lo largo de todas las Fiestas del Pilar a través de proyectos como El Bosque de los zaragozanos, en el que Endesa ya colabora. El tercer eje tiene que ver con todo lo que tiene lugar dentro del festival, invitando al público a ser respetuoso con el medioambiente y a tener un evento limpio, por lo que todos los vasos van a ser reutilizables. Además, en distintas zonas del recinto habrás puntos de reciclaje y se invitará a los asistentes a colaborar. «Desde Endesa queremos trasladar el mensaje de que la música puede ser sostenible y que el disfrute no está reñido con ser respetuoso con nuestro entorno», reconocen. Y en eso hacen hincapié, llegando a un público joven y haciéndolo con un mensaje muy arraigado, como es la sostenibilidad, que está «en el ADN de Endesa», señalan. Y es por eso que la compañía se mantiene como patrocinador sostenible; no solo como imagen de marca, sino que «queremos que nuestra participación tenga una trascendencia con datos demostrables, aportar nuestro granito de arena», aseveran. La experiencia de Endesa puede ayudar a los festivales de música, como el que se celebra en Zaragoza estos días, a ser más respetuosos con el entorno, reconocen, porque llevan ya muchos años trabajando en esta materia. Pero no solo en la música, ya que hace ya unos años que comenzó con los patrocinios en el deporte en general y el baloncesto en particular; y viendo el éxito y la buena acogida, decidieron entrar también en el ámbito cultura. Y para llegar a un público más joven, «pensamos que la música era un vehículo muy adecuado». Además, hay que tener en cuenta que la sociedad cada vez reclamaba que los festivales musicales fueran más respetuosos y Endesa ya tenía parte del camino hecho. Ya solo queda esperar unas horas para que el Espacio Zity abra sus puertas y la música empiece a sonar, que el público llene el recinto. De la sostenibilidad se encarga Endesa.
