    "text": "Thousands of British Steel jobs at risk after owner rejects government offer to go green\nThe Chinese parent company have rejected the government’s subsidy offer to aid transition to producing green steel\nMore than 2,000 jobs at British Steel could be at risk, after Chinese parent company Jingye rejected a £500m subsidy offer from the UK government - leading to talks over the possible closure of two furnaces.\nA public announcement is expected soon, said one trade union on Thursday morning, with more than half of British Steel’s 3,500-strong workforce potentially impacted. British Steel, the second-largest producer in the country, have begun a redundancy consultation on closing two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe.\nThe steel industry was hit earlier this month by one of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which placed an additional 25 per cent cost on steel and aluminium imports and led to orders being cancelled.\nGovernment data shows the steelmaking industry contributing £2.3bn to the UK economy in 2023, equivalent to one per cent of manufacturing output.\nSky reported on Wednesday that the government’s offer, made by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds aimed at aiding the transition to producing green steel, had been turned down.\nIndustry minister Sarah Jones told the business and trade select committee that they were “still in talks”, but reports suggest Jingye were looking for in excess of £1bn from the aid package.\nCommunity Trade Union general secretary, Roy Rickhuss, released a statement noting a “dark day” for the industry.\n“We urge Jingye and the UK Government to get back around the table to resume negotiations before it is too late,” Mr Rickhuss said.\n“Cruciallly, Jingye have not ruled out retaining the blast furnaces during a transition to low carbon steelmaking if they can secure the backing of the Government.\n“The closures at Scunthorpe would represent a hammer blow to communities which were built on steel, and where the industry still supports thousands of jobs directly and thousands more through extensive supply chains.”\nCommunity had unveiled their plan in February aimed at securing a future for the Scunthorpe sites amid a shift towards greener production.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",

    "text": "NORTH SOUND, Wash. — It was a scary and very close call for one North Sound homeowner whose pipes were on the verge of bursting from the bitter cold Friday morning.\nThankfully, a plumber came out just in time before the worst could’ve happened.\n“Frozen pipes, we’re gonna replace one,” said Bryan Jones, who’s a plumber with Homage.\nHe has helped provide services for seniors in Snohomish County for years.\nOn Friday, he was called out to a mobile home with pipes that had frozen over.\n“This block line that they used coming into their house, there’s water that froze inside of this and that’s what I’ve been doin’ for the past 20 minutes, trying to figure out where it froze,” Jones explained.\nIn this case, Jones tells KIRO 7 the line wasn’t insulated enough underneath the house.\nBut it was the homeowner, John, who first realized something was wrong when he woke up.\n“I went to flush the toilet and that’s when I first noticed when the water filled up the tank and I ran the faucet and I realized that the pipes must’ve frozen,” said John.\nIn his 14 years of living here, John says it’s the first time this has happened. After experiencing it firsthand, he’s going to make some changes.\n“I think I’m going to leave my pipes running at night, I’ve heard that too, but I’ve never had to do it before,” he said.\nThat’s advice that Jones agrees with. Jones advises letting your faucets trickle keeps water moving while leaving cabinets open to allow warm air to circulate.\n“If they have doubts about what they’re doing, stop. Just don’t do it,” he said.\nJones warns against trying to fix it yourself and to call for help immediately.\n“I’ve seen hoses ran for main lines and that’s no good ever,” Jones explained. “I wouldn’t recommend leaving a space heater going underneath your house, I would not recommend that.”\nHere are some tips you should keep in mind when dealing with freezing temperatures:\n· Check your car – Soda and beer can explode if left in the car and water will freeze up.\n· Keep car gassed up - Triple A says at least half a tank can prevent fuel lines from freezing up.\n· Bring in patio furniture – Saves them from freezing over and prevents mold & mildew build-up.\n· Cover your plants – Draping over blankets, towels, and tarps can help stop the frost.\n©2024 Cox Media Group",

    "title": "Alex Morgan retires a legend, changed game for all women athletes",
    "text": "Alex Morgan is the rare athlete whose impact off the playing field was as great as it was on it. Maybe even greater. Morgan, who announced her retirement Thursday , leaves the game as a two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist. She’s fifth on the U.S. women’s national team’s all-time scoring list, with only five of her 123 goals coming from the penalty spot. She was runner-up twice for FIFA’s Player of the Year, and third another time, and her six appearances on FIFPRO’s World XI is second-most in history. More significantly, Morgan leaves women’s sports in a far better spot than they were when her career began. She was instrumental in the USWNT’s fight for equal pay and played a significant role in the NWSL’s first-ever contract . The league’s first anti-harassment policy was a direct result of her efforts. She helped spark the current investment boom in women’s sports, pushing sponsors and potential owners to recognize their growth potential. She knew her star status gave her influence, and she used it for the greater good. “Charlie came up to me the other day and said that when she grows up, she wants to be a soccer player,” Morgan said in her retirement announcement , referring to her young daughter. “It just made me immensely proud. Not because I wish for her to become a soccer player when she grows up, but because a pathway exists that even a 4-year-old can see now. “We’re changing lives,” Morgan said, her voice choking. “The impact we have on the next generation is irreversible, and I’m proud in the hand I had in making that happen and pushing the game forward and leaving it in a place that I’m so happy and proud of.” Morgan, now 35, didn’t set out to be a disruptor. She wanted to play soccer, a sport she’s loved for as long as she can remember. But very soon after joining the USWNT, she found herself cast as America’s sweetheart, inheriting the role Mia Hamm once had. Soccer fans loved her ruthlessness — there’s more than a few opposing goalkeepers who still get the shakes at the memory of Morgan bearing down on them — and those who didn’t know much, or care, about the game were captivated by her wholesome good looks. At a time when tennis players and Olympians were the only women athletes to have any kind of commercial success, Morgan became an exception. But rather than insulating her, Morgan’s privileged status brought the wrongs that existed into sharper focus. When Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Becky Sauerbrunn and Hope Solo filed a wage discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016, Morgan joined them. “I felt significantly younger and more inexperienced than” the others, Morgan told USA TODAY Sports last year. “I felt like, in that moment, that was an opportunity to learn, to get out of my shell and feel uncomfortable even when doing the right thing. “And so I think that was a pivotal moment for me, in realizing this platform that I have and this opportunity that I have in front of me to be able to say something and have people listen.” OPINION: How Alex Morgan grew from USWNT rising star to powerful advocate: 'She’s been incredible' That complaint would be the precursor to the equal pay lawsuit, which the USWNT players filed three months before the 2019 World Cup. Morgan became the lead plaintiff, knowing her name and fame would draw more attention to the case and increase the pressure on U.S. Soccer. Though she and Rapinoe were the public faces of the lawsuit, which resulted in a landmark contract in 2022, Morgan’s involvement went well beyond that. Becca Roux, executive director for the USWNT Players Association, recalled Morgan returning documents with edits and notes. She was an active participant in calls with attorneys and advisers. But her activism wasn’t limited to equal pay. Once she found her voice, Morgan raised it for a variety of issues. She was outspoken in support of racial equality and LGBTQ+ rights. She was a steadfast ally to Mana Shim, her then-teammate who reported an abusive coach, and when Shim’s story became public, Morgan was unflinching in her demands that both the NWSL and U.S. Soccer do more to protect players. Frustrated with the lack of coverage of women’s sports and women’s athletes, Morgan joined with Sue Bird, Chloe Kim and Simone Manuel to create Togethxr , a media and commerce company. She also wrote a series of children’s books, The Kicks , that promote teamwork and positivity for young girls. And when critics called the USWNT “arrogant” during the 2019 World Cup for having the audacity to own their greatness, Morgan pushed back — hard — at the double standard and the misogyny behind it . “I'm so proud of what I've done because of having Charlie and knowing that she isn't going to have to fight the battles that I had to fight,” Morgan told USA TODAY Sports last year. “My hope is that I fight for it now so she doesn't have to. She gets to just have fun. She gets to play. She gets to do what she loves without worrying about that.” Morgan is one of the greatest to ever play the game, in this country or any other. But it's the work she did to level the playing field for the girls and young women who come after her, in soccer and every other sport, that make her a legend.

    "text": "Meghan Trainor was told that parenthood would end her career\nBy\nIANS | Published: January 31, 2025 09:38 AM2025-01-31T09:38:40+5:302025-01-31T09:40:08+5:30\nLos Angeles, Jan 31 Grammy winner Meghan Trainor, who has Riley and 18-month-old Barry with husband Daryl ...\nLos Angeles, Jan 31 Grammy winner Meghan Trainor, who has Riley and 18-month-old Barry with husband Daryl Sabara, recalled being warned that her career would come to an end if she had children because \"nobody really cares\" about mothers in the music industry.\nShe told People magazine: “Once they got pregnant, they were like, ‘You’re done.' I was told at 20 by an older gentleman in the industry, ‘Well, she’s a mom, so nobody really cares.’ I was like, ‘Ouch!’”\nHowever, the 'Dear Future Husband' hitmaker believes her career has gained \"a whole new life\" since having her sons.\nShe said: “When I became a mom, my career had a whole new life. I had a whole reboot, and it’s because my kids made me want to be the best version of me. I’m not peaking. I’ve just begun.”\nShe took her children on the road when she toured last year and it was a great experience for the whole family, reports femalefirst.co.uk.\nShe recalled: “I’d be fully glammed up, picking boogies, putting diapers on, putting them in their pyjamas before a show. My glitter would be leaking on them; I would peel eyelashes off them all the time, but they loved it.\n“Nobody misses it more than Riley. Every day he’s like, ‘Can we go back on tour?’ ”\nTrainor is thrilled with how her life has turned out, she admitted there is still one thing she is hoping for - \"some daughters\".\nShe said: “Where I am right now is far beyond anything I could have ever dreamed of. I always wanted a family. Check. Now I need some daughters. But I never thought I could be a pop star because I didn’t believe in myself.\n\"Now 19-year-old Meghan putting out ‘All About that Bass’ is stoked; she’s so proud, like, ‘I didn’t know you could do that.’ It took 10 years to become brave, but I’m finally thriving.”\nThe 'All About That Bass'' singer doesn't worry about her sales figures or chart performance because all that matters is that her kids \"love\" her work.\nShe said: \"Priorities shifted [when I became a mom]. It’s like, ‘What charts? My kids love this.' At night when we’re doing bath time, I’m like, ‘Want to hear Mommy’s new song?’ Getting to talk to my older son now, I’ll ask, ‘What does Mommy do?’ He’s like, ‘She’s a pop star.’ Like, yeah, Mommy’s cool!”\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",

    "text": "With increasingly extreme weather driving steady increases in insured losses, upgrading infrastructure is a vitally important task\nSNP’s track record on delivering flood protection schemes is as bad as we’ve come to expect – Scotsman comment\nAs scientists have been warning for decades, the cost of allowing global warming to continue will become increasingly high as extreme weather becomes more common and more extreme. With the world having collectively decided to carry on producing greenhouse gas emissions in ever-higher amounts, there is, therefore, a need to take steps to protect ourselves against storms, floods and droughts that are only going to get worse.\nThis means upgrading infrastructure – railway lines, roads, homes, electricity supplies, the list goes on – designed for a more benign climate to ensure it is fit for purpose. It will be expensive, but if the work is not done, then the resulting damage could be worse.\nAccording to reinsurer Swiss Re, insured losses stemming from natural catastrophes worldwide rose to $50 billion in the first six months of this year, with severe thunderstorms accounting for 70 per cent of the total. Insured losses have been growing at between five and seven per cent a year, the firm said, driven by the warming climate and higher economic values – of property, for example – in cities.\nStorm Gerrit has provided Scotland with the latest wake-up call about the dangers of extreme weather, focussing attention on the state of our flood defences. According to the Scottish Liberal Democrats, just 15 out of 42 flood protection schemes identified for delivery between 2015 and 2021 have actually been completed. The delays and the fact that costs have soared by as much as 1,000 per cent will come as no surprise to those familiar with the SNP’s track record of delivery.\nLiberal Democrat rural affairs spokeswoman Beatrice Wishart, who called for a “Climate Emergency Communities Fund” to upgrade homes, businesses and infrastructure, said: “When it comes to major storms, an ounce of prevention can be worth a pound of cure but dozens of prospective projects are unfinished and the costs are also going through the roof.”\nFuture-proofing Scotland against the growing storm is a vast and complicated task that requires competent, dedicated people in government. The consequences of bad spending decisions today may well be felt for generations to come.",
