    "text": "Maya Hawke Captivates in Trailer for Biopic WILDCAT Directed by Ethan Hawke A trailer has been released for the upcoming film Wildcat, directed by four-time Oscar-nominated actor Ethan Hawke, who previously directed Chelsea Walls, The Hottest State, and Blaze. The film stars his daughter, Maya Hawke, who is best known for playing the role of Robin in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things. In Wildcat, Maya Hawke portrays Flannery O'Connor (March 25, 1925 – August 3, 1964), the American novelist, short story writer and essayist. The ensemble includes Laura Linney, Philip Ettinger, Rafael Casal, Cooper Hoffman, and Christine Dye. The screenplay was written by Shelby Gaines and Ethan Hawke. The synopsis reads: In 1950, Flannery O'Connor (Maya Hawke) visits her mother Regina (Laura Linney) in Georgia when she is diagnosed with lupus at 24 years old. Struggling with the same disease that took her father's life when she was a child and desperate to make her mark as a great writer, this crisis pitches her imagination into a feverish exploration of belief. As she dives deeper into her craft, the lines between reality, imagination, and faith begin to blur, allowing Flannery to ultimately come to peace with her situation & heal a strained relationship with her mother. This looks truly captivating, and it feels like this may be a film that both Maya and Ethan Hawke will be celebrated for, for the rest of their careers. Check out the trailer below, and watch Wildcat in select US theatres on May 3rd. [GeekTyrant Homepage](/)",
