    "text": "Hello, Central Coast! Happy Saturday. Here are some of the latest weather headlines taking place across the Central Coast today and for this work week. Besides some windy conditions taking place in the mountainous areas today, we are expecting mild weather with partly cloudy skies and a warming trend through Tuesday. Another system is expected to bring gusty winds on Wednesday. Lastly, a chance of widespread rain and unsettled weather may return this upcoming weekend. Let’s dive in! Sub-advisory northerly winds are expected to continue moving across the mountains and it may be channeling into a few elevated coastal valleys through this evening. Wind gusts are expected to pick up near or over 30mph in Gaviota and Refugio on Sunday evening just after 6pm. For the start of the new work week, a broad and generally weak northwest flow will continue Monday through Wednesday, which may support continued weak to moderate eddy across southern California. Expect fair to mostly clear skies but they are expected to prevail. Night to morning low clouds will be present for at least some coastal areas of the Central Coast. A weak system is expected to pass through the region on Wednesday. This system may be slightly stronger and wetter with a 10 to 30 percent chance of rain north of Santa Barbara. The highest chances may take place across the western portion of San Luis Obispo County. High pressure is expected to build in the region on Monday and will provide a slow warming trend through Tuesday with some areas reaching 70 degrees for the first time in a while. Increased cloud cover and lowering heights will knock temperatures back down a few degrees into Wednesday. By Thursday and the better part of Friday (especially for areas south of Point Conception), we will continue to have fair conditions with seasonable temperatures. Increasing mid to high clouds may keep the diurnal temperature range in check, especially into Friday. The latest KSBY 7-Day Forecast model shows that there is a chance that a storm system could arrive next weekend with unsettled weather potentially continuing into the following week. Have a great day, Central Coast! Don’t forget to download the KSBY Microclimate App for the latest weather headlines.",

    "text": "Oh, you thought summer was fun? Wait until fall hits in Miami. After a surprise re-opening set for this coming weekend, Club Space Miami just announced its end-of-the-year full calendar. Now, we know the Insomniac venue is known for their incredible House and Techno acts, but let’s see if they’re bringing the heat with these artists. They also announced that Space’s jointed venues The Ground and Floyd enjoyed a well-deserved facelift.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by S P A C E (@spacemiami)\nFull Calendar September will finish with a bang with acts like Peggy Gou, Green Velvet, Fisher, and Dombresky gracing the Terrace. October is filled with amazing melodic acts including Miss Monique, Bob Moses, Nora en Pure, Marsh, and Innellea. Furthermore, Club Space will once again host the official satellite afterparties for III Points Music Festival , also hosted by Insomniac . November gets a spooky start for Halloween weekend with the soundscapes of Nicole Moudaber, Paco Osuna, Seth Troxler, and an impactul b2b with Dixon and Âme. After a night with Brazilian star Vintage Culture, the Techno takes over for shows with Joseph Capriati, Carl Cox, Deborah de Luca, Camelphat, and a heavy night with Psymama Indira Paganotto and direct support from Lee Ann Roberts. Thanksgiving will be extremely groovy with Space’s signature DJ Marco Carola, before Enamour, Wax Motif, and Acraze.\nDecember will be a phenomenal end of the year, starting with 6 days of parties for Art Basel week. Exhale’s label boss lady Amelie Lens returns to the Terrace, as well as Ilario Alicante and Duke Dumont. New Years week will have you baffled with parties going from Friday the 27th to Wednesday January 1st. Space’s residents will provide heavy support to all these amazing acts.\nRefreshing The Ground and Floyd Sister venues for Club Space are locating on the bottom floor, and they will be as fun as ever. Including major redesign opportunities, there will be more space to dance at The Ground, as they took away the VIP section. Moreover, the space will continue to book live acts, but shift gears to the more niche and underground genres that deserve a space in the electronic dance scene in Miami. So if you want to break your neck at The Ground to some Dubstep, or Drum and Bass, this is your call. Floyd will now have a DJ-centered experience for more intimate shows with the audience. The expansion of both rooms was long overdue, and we can’t wait to see it. The Ground has also served as a lounge area during the iconic marathons at the Terrace.\nSo what do we think about the Space calendar? Are we getting tickets or what?!",

    "text": "A seemingly simple quilt covers a lot more than just the person underneath it. Attend a few quilt presentation ceremonies with Collene Munn and PA Stitchers of Valor and you’ll become familiar with the sight of public tears emerging from unexpected sources. Munn is the group leader for the local chapter of the National Quilts of Valor Foundation, which awards hand-crafted quilts to area veterans nominated by family and friends. In an instance of turnabout being fair play, it was Munn who was nominated this time: Tribune readers wrote in to draw attention to her work honoring veterans. Since its start in 2017 the group has awarded 602 quilts. “It’s a lot of quilts, but we look at it another way,” Munn said earlier this week. “It’s a lot of veterans recognized for their service.” Seeing the impact of that recognition not only makes it easy to keep going but provides a reward for those awarding the quilts. Munn recalled an example of that impact from the first time the group’s quilt stitchers had a booth at the Crawford County Fair six years ago. Several fairgoers told them of a Vietnam veteran in poor health who they said ought to be honored. Acting quickly, the group contacted the man to see if he could meet them at the fair. After he arrived at the fairgrounds, a golf cart transported him, the person who nominated him and his caretaker to the PA Stitchers booth. “When we got done, he was so proud of that quilt, he said he wanted to take that quilt wrapped around his shoulders, and walk all over the fairgrounds so people could see,” Munn said. “He did walk around part of the fair. ... He didn’t have that strength when he came, but the quilt brought him so much.” Munn recalled another veteran, accompanied by his daughter, receiving a quilt in 2018 at the Diamond Park display. Again and again the man, crying, asked his daughter why he was receiving a quilt when so many others were more deserving, Munn said. “When they got back to their car, he broke down and sobbed,” she continued. “He said, ‘No one ever recognized me for my service before.’” Munn never imagined the group would piece together so many quilts when she first started. “There’s a whole lot more veterans in our area than I knew,” she said. Currently about 150 veterans are on the waiting list for quilts from PA Stitchers of Valor. The group was recently the top vote getter in the annual Palmiero Toyota Give Back Program contest and received $5,000. The first few months of the year will be spent building up stock for the presentation ceremonies that will be held in May. Quilting bees on Feb. 2 and 3 will be held at Saegertown United Methodist Church and New Beginnings Church of God in conjunction with the Quilts of Valor Foundation’s National Sew Day. “It’s a fun time,” Munn said of the event that often draws multiple generations from participating families. “It’s something we enjoy doing, and we’re using what we like to do for a good cause.” • To nominate a veteran to be awarded a quilt: Contact Munn at (814) 333-8595. More information is available at the PA Stitchers of Valor page on Facebook.",

    "text": "\nBrent Lakatos ajoute l'or à sa collection au 800 m T 53\nLes cinq dernières médailles paralympiques de Brent Lakatos en étaient d'argent et les deux qui les avaient précédées en étaient de bronze. Inutile de préciser que l'athlète en fauteuil roulant attendait fermement le titre de champion paralympique qu'il a décroché jeudi au 800 m T53.\nMaintenant 13 fois médaillé paralympique, deux fois d'or, Brent Lakatos avait déclaré avec beaucoup de confiance qu'il allait être à surveiller pour cette épreuve, quelques instants après avoir mérité l'argent au 400 m T53.\n« Je m'attends encore à mieux pour le 800 m! Je pense vraiment que ce sera mon épreuve la plus forte », avait dit celui qui a aussi participé au 5000 m T54 et au 1500 m T53 à Paris, ses sixièmes Jeux paralympiques.\nLe Dorvalois est passé de la parole aux actes jeudi sur la piste violette du Stade de France. Et il l'a fait avec panache. Le champion du monde en titre du 800 m T53 a rapidement pris la tête de cette finale. Au deuxième tour, avec environ 200 mètres à parcourir, Lakatos est parvenu à bloquer le chemin à son rival Pongsakorn Paeyo, de la Thaïlande. Celui qui avait gagné l'or sur cette distance, à Rio et à Tokyo.\nCette fois, le représentant canadien a accéléré après avoir défendu sa première place et Paeyo a été incapable de suivre le rythme. L'avance du vainqueur n'a fait que s'accentuer dans la dernière ligne droite. Il a enregistré un temps de 1 min 37,32 s et a franchi la ligne d'arrivée 1,06 seconde devant le Thaïlandais. L'Américain Brian Siemann a fini troisième en 1 min 38,44 s.\n« On avait une bonne stratégie, qui était de prendre le contrôle de la course dès le départ. Non seulement j'ai réussi à faire ça, mais j'ai aussi fermé la porte à Paeyo! J'ai bien exécuté le plan jusqu'au sprint final », a résumé Brent Lakatos.\n« Ça aura pris huit longues années et beaucoup de médailles d'argent! Ça fait tellement du bien d'être de retour au sommet du podium aux Jeux. On va chanter le Ô Canada ce soir! »\nUne fois la course terminée, une dame lui a demandé s'il souhaitait faire sonner la cloche du Stade de France, comme ont pris l'habitude de le faire les médaillés d'or des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques.\n« Bien sûr que je veux! » a rapidement répondu Lakatos. « C'était quelque chose de vraiment cool. J'ai donné tout ce que j'avais. »\nMédaillé de bronze à Rio et d'argent à Tokyo sur 800 m, le Canadien a connu beaucoup de succès sur cette distance au cours des dernières années. Son record du monde de 1 min 31,69 s, établi en 2019, tient toujours le coup.\n« Le 800 m est vraiment ma distance préférée. J'ai développé beaucoup d'endurance en faisant des 5000 mètres et des marathons et c'est une course où tu as besoin d'un bon départ, d'une bonne vitesse et de savoir la maintenir, en plus d'user de stratégie. Ça demande un peu de tout ! » a expliqué le médaillé d'or.\nUn cycle paralympique pas comme les autres\nBrent Lakatos était assuré de signer son meilleur résultat de la saison jeudi, tout simplement parce qu'il s'agissait de sa toute première course au 800 m.\n« J'étais en excellente forme et j'ai commencé à ressentir de la douleur, en mai dernier », a rappelé celui qui a subi une fracture de stress à une côte à l'entraînement.\n« J'ai eu 7 semaines pour préparer mon retour et revenir là où j'en étais avant la blessure.»\nSon cycle paralympique a débuté avec une pause sportive d'environ 18 mois après les Jeux de Tokyo. Lakatos s'est vite démarqué à son retour, décrochant trois médailles aux Championnats du monde de para-athlétisme, en 2023.\nIl a tout de même choisi de réduire son programme en prévision de ses sixièmes Jeux, passant de six à quatre épreuves au total. Le 100 m et le marathon allaient se disputer sans lui à Paris. Une décision qu'il ne regrette pas, bien au contraire.\n« Si je n'avais pas décidé ça avant la blessure, je n'aurais pas eu le choix après de toute façon, a-t-il précisé. Ça m'a beaucoup aidé dans ma préparation, parce que je n'avais plus à m'entraîner avec deux types de gants pour les différents départs. »\n« J'ai été très chanceux tout au long de ma carrière. Pas de grosse blessure, sauf cette année, et toute une équipe derrière moi. Je suis très reconnaissant de faire partie de cette équipe », a raconté l'athlète de 44 ans qui, par le passé, a souvent soulevé la possibilité de se retirer après des Jeux paralympiques…\n« Je pense que j'ai dit que j'allais prendre ma retraite après tous les Jeux depuis ceux de 2008! Ce n'est toujours pas arrivé, je pense que je ne vais rien dire cette fois-ci! On attend et on verra. »",
