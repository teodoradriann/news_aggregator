    "title": "Dem Rep Switches Districts After Georgia Legislature Demolishes Hers - TPM – Talking Points Memo",
    "text": "A federal judge has ruled in a closely watched redistricting case out of Georgia, preserving a Republican gerrymander that [dismantled the district represented by Rep. Lucy McBath](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/georgia-republicans-map-mcbath) (D). McBath said shortly after the decision that she would run in a new district. The [Atlanta Journal Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/politics/breaking-georgias-republican-redistricting-plan-upheld-by-federal-judge/5YEJGZ25HBC6NPJUOLC54MAWN4/) reported that the maps would likely remain in place through at least Election Day 2024. The maps, approved by the Georgia legislature and signed into law by Governor Brian Kemp (R) earlier this month, maintain Republicans’ 9-5 advantage in the state’s congressional representation. It protects Republican members of Congress who may have faced a challenging reelection, and shows the impact of years of efforts by the Supreme Court to carve away chunks of the Voting Rights Act. U.S. District Judge Steven Jones, who issued [today’s ruling](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24245229/12-28-23-jones-order-pendergrass.pdf), had ordered the legislature to draw new maps earlier this year after finding that its 2021 redistricting diluted the strength of Black voters. In response to his order, Georgia’s Republican-controlled legislature created an obvious partisan gerrymander, Jones wrote. But it was not a racial gerrymander, he found, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that such aggressive partisan gerrymanders are allowed. “[T]he committee and floor debate transcripts make clear that the General Assembly created the 2023 Remedial Congressional Plan in a manner that politically protected the majority party (i.e., the Republican Party) as much as possible,” wrote Jones, an Obama appointee. “However, redistricting decisions by a legislative body with an eye toward securing partisan advantage does not alone violate Section 2,” he wrote, citing Rucho v. Common Cause, a [recent Supreme Court ruling on Section 2](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/scotus-wont-rein-in-partisan-gerrymandering). “[T]he Supreme Court has expressly stated that federal judges have no license to reallocate political power between the two major political parties, given the lack of constitutional authority and the absence of legal standards to direct such decisions,” Jones wrote. The decision was largely silent on a key issue that both friends and foes of the VRA have been watching closely: whether a district in which white voters are a minority, but in which no group is a majority, constitutes a protected, majority-minority district under the law. One such district was McBath’s, which was controlled by a minority coalition of Black, Latino and Asian voters. Jones sidestepped that question, saying it was not a part of the dispute at hand. “From its onset, however, this case has been about Black voters,” Jones’ wrote, adding in a footnote that question of how coalitions of multiple minority groups should be handled would be “better suited for a separate case.” Civil rights groups may appeal Jones’ ruling. Meanwhile, a separate case out of Galveston County, Texas is winding its way through federal court, seeking an answer to a similar set of questions about coalition districts.

    "text": "The Depo-Provera birth control shot has been linked to an increased risk of a type of brain tumors known as meningiomas.\nWomen who received the Depo shot and were diagnosed with meningioma brain tumors may be eligible to file a lawsuit and receive compensation for their illnesses.\nDepo-Provera Linked to Meningioma Brain Tumors\nDepo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) is a type of birth control shot designed to prevent pregnancy using the hormone progestin. The shot is sold under the brand names Depo-Provera and Depo-SubQ Provera 104, as well as “authorized generic” versions.\nAccording to a study published earlier this year by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), women who used the Depo-Provera shot face an increased risk of being diagnosed with meningioma. Researchers involved in the BMJ study found that users of the Depo shot were 5.76-times more likely to be diagnosed with these tumors.\nMeningiomas are a type of benign tumor that can form near the brain or spinal cord. Although meningiomas are non-cancerous, patients who are diagnosed with these tumors may be forced to undergo surgery in order to have them removed, which can increase the risk of serious complications.\nPatients who develop meningioma may experience symptoms that can include blurry vision, headaches, numbness, and seizures.\nLawsuits Against Depo-Provera by Women with Meningioma Brain Tumors\nThe first Depo-Provera lawsuit against Pfizer, the manufacturer of the birth control shot, was filed in October 2024 by a woman who was diagnosed with meningioma tumors.\nSince this first claim was filed, several more lawsuits against Depo-Provera have been filed in California, Pennsylvania, and other states by women who were diagnosed with brain tumors after using the Depo shot.\nThese lawsuits have alleged that the Pfizer failed to properly warn women who used Depo-Provera and their doctors about the long-term health risks of using the birth control shot, including the risk of developing meningioma brain tumors.\nWomen With Brain Tumors May Qualify to File a Depo-Provera Lawsuit\nIf you or a loved one used Depo-Provera or alternate version of the birth control shot (including Depo-SubQ Provera 104 or “authorized generic” versions) for 12 months or more and have been diagnosed with meningioma brain tumors, you may be entitled to file a lawsuit and receive compensation for your illness.\nThe first step in filing a Depo-Provera lawsuit is to contact a law firm with experience handling lawsuits involving side effects from birth control.\nAfter contacting a lawyer about your claim, your attorney or one of the female staff members at their law firm will help you to confidentially review your medical history and to help you determine whether you are eligible to take legal action.\nFor women who qualify to file a claim, your attorney can help you to gather all of the relevant medical records and other evidence to prove your claim in court and help you receive the compensation to which you are entitled to under the law.\nSee more »\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.

    "text": "OTTAWA — The $18.4 million CBC/Radio-Canada awarded in bonuses to its employees this year is shocking, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said.\nHe also said bonuses at the public broadcaster aren't justified because a government-owned corporation doesn't face competition like in the private sector.\n\"The juicy bonuses given under the pretext that without them we aren't competitive in the market — well, we've been hearing that for decades .... Negotiate yourself a salary,\" Blanchet told reporters in the lobby of the House of Commons.\nDescribing bonuses as icing on a cake, Blanchet suggested the corporation was using them as a \"kind of backdoor salary\" that hides how much people are really being paid because the bonuses are only revealed in the media \"once a year.\"\n\"There can be a little bit of icing, but when the icing becomes part of the salary, I usually start to question things,\" Blanchet said, adding that the millions of dollars in bonuses \"shocks\" him.\nThe Canadian Press reported this week that the public broadcaster paid $18.4 million in bonuses to 1,194 employees this year after it eliminated hundreds of jobs. That included $3.3 million paid to 45 executives, which comes out to an average bonus of more than $73,000.\nMore than $10.4 million was paid out to 631 managers, and over $4.6 million was paid to 518 other employees.\nThis year's amount is an increase from the $14.9 million paid out to 1,143 employees in the 2022-23 fiscal year.\nOpposition Conservatives want the head of the public broadcaster, Catherine Tait, to return to the parliamentary hot seat and provide answers. Earlier this year, members of the House heritage committee unanimously concluded in a report presented to the House of Commons that, given the budget cuts, it would be inappropriate for the CBC to award bonuses to its executives.\nIt is not clear whether Tait was among those who received performance pay this year. The CEO's performance pay is determined based on a recommendation from the CBC/Radio-Canada board of directors, with approval from the federal government.\nThe CBC and the federal government have both refused to answer questions, citing privacy rules.\nBetween December 2023 and March 31, CBC/Radio-Canada laid off 141 employees and cut 205 vacant positions.\nNDP heritage critic Niki Ashton said, \"it is time to prohibit the CBC from giving bonuses to executives, and for it to use that money to save local journalism.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.\nÉmilie Bergeron, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "Scarsdale NY: Hateful graffiti found on storefronts at shopping center",
    "text": "Hateful graffiti apparently targeted at Jewish-owned businesses was found on two storefront windows at a Scarsdale shopping center Thursday morning. New Rochelle police said the words \"genocide supporter\" were written in black spray-paint on the windows of Cheryl's Closet, a women's clothing boutique, and Scoop Shop, an ice cream store, at the Golden Horseshoe Shopping Center on Wilmot Road at the border of Scarsdale and New Rochelle. State Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, called the graffiti on two Jewish-owned businesses a \"hateful act of antisemitism\" that is \"reprehensible and will not be tolerated.\" Myra Clark-Siegel, regional director of the American Jewish Committee's Westchester-Fairfield office and a resident of Scarsdale, said the Golden Horseshoe Shopping Center is frequently used by the significant Jewish community in the area. It is the home of Seasons, a popular Kosher supermarket, and is across the street from the Jewish Community Center of Mid-Westchester. \"We found out about the incident this morning through some community social media posts,\" Clark-Siegel said. \"It's Thursday, which means that people are going to the shopping center since Friday is Shabbat.\" Say no to hate: Acts of antisemitism have been shocking to witness in New York Agnes Baione, an employee at Cheryl's Closet, said she was overwhelmed by the support the community had given the store on Thursday. \"It's just amazing to see,\" she said. \"Everyone has been in here today extending their sympathies. We even had the mayor come in.\" Adam Deutsch has run Scoop Shop at the Golden Horseshoe Shopping Center since 2018. Deutsch, who is Jewish, said he was shaken by the morning incident, but said the support of the community has left him hopeful. \"I'm still a little bit shocked,\" Deutsch said, \"but the amount of support we've been getting is unbelievable.\" He said threats were never made to his store before this incident. He remains full of resolve with the backing of his community. \"We're not going anywhere,\" Deutsch said. \"We still support who we support and we're proud. A little graffiti is not going to do anything.\" Clark-Siegel said a local synagogue and other community leaders are holding a meet-up at the center at 4 p.m. Thursday to address the incident and the growing number of antisemitic incidents in the area. \"This ugly act of antisemitism has no place in Westchester or anywhere else, and targeting a large Jewish population is a vile form of hatred,\" Clark-Siegel said. \"We must all take a zero tolerance approach to fight its spread.\" New Rochelle police said a suspect has not yet been found and the incident is still under investigation. Westchester District Attorney Mimi Rocah and New Rochelle Police Commissioner Robert Gazzola issued a joint statement, insisting there is zero tolerance for hate in Westchester. \"We understand the unsettling atmosphere of fear across all impacted communities and the safety of our residents and businesses remains a top priority for law enforcement,\" their statement read. \"We have zero tolerance for hatred and bias in Westchester and we will use the full force of the law to hold perpetrators accountable and keep our communities safe.\" Paulin called the act a threat to Jews everywhere. \"If history is any kind of guide, this will not end here,\" she said. \"The Nazis did not stop with the Jews, they also persecuted persons with disabilities, those they considered racially different from themselves, homosexuals, Jehovah Witnesses, and many others. Racists know no boundaries. In short, they seek to destroy the diversity that makes communities like ours great.\" Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said \"These despicable acts not only affect the Jewish community, but all of us. We must all speak out when we see incidents of antisemitism, and hatred of any group, for remaining silent gives tacit approval.\"",

Localised flooding is also considered possible in urban and poor drainage locations through the city, while wind speeds will be slightly higher than usual.\nIt's expected that some of these weather conditions will continue into Saturday, with rain likely to continue until late in the evening of that day. This is the result of a developing storm system in the Gulf of Mexico.\nUltra Miami kicks off today at Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami, and continues through to Sunday, 24th March. DJ Mag has requested a comment from Ultra regarding safety precautions surrounding the potential inclement weather at the festival.\nArmin van Buuren, Peggy Gou, Chase & Status, David Guetta, Miss Monique and Orbital are among the acts on the bill for this year's event.

    "text": "ROCKPORT — An earthquake with a magnitude of 2.3 was recorded Tuesday off the coast of Rockport, according to the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake was reported at 6:24 p.m. and was about 33.6 miles (54 kilometers) east of Rockport. On Wednesday morning, Rockport police reported they had not received any reports of damage or injuries resulting from the earthquake. In addition, other earthquakes were also reported in New England — a second one with a magnitude of 1.8 was about .6 miles (1 kilometer) south of Boxborough and a third with a magnitude of 2.1 was reported 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) north northwest off the coast of Nantucket. In spite of the report, many in town did not experience any affects from the earthquake. Select Board Vice-Chair Ross Brackett, who also owns and operates Brothers Brew Coffee Shop at 27 Main St., said neither he nor his customers knew an earthquake had been recorded off Rockport’s coast. “I didn’t hear anything about it,” he said. “My customers didn’t say anything about it either.” Reports of earthquakes were also observed in several New England communities, including in Peabody, Erving and also off the coast of Edgartown on Martha’s Vineyard, according to the USGS. A major earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9, considered the largest in Massachusetts history, took place on Nov. 18, 1755, at about 4:30 a.m. The epicenter was believed to have been offshore, about 24 miles east of Cape Ann, according to the science website Cape Ann Weather. This earthquake is thought to have created the first recorded tsunami in U.S. history. Observers in the Leeward Islands nearly 1,000 miles south of Cape Ann reported at the time that receding of water followed by a large wave lifted several boats ashore and left scores of fish floundering on the beach.
