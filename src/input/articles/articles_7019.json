    "text": "Al-Aqsa Flood was a 'fully Palestinian operation', Iran's IRGC says The 7 October attack by Hamas' military wing \"was a fully Palestinian operation\" and not orchestrated by Tehran, the commander in chief of Iran's [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)](https://www.newarab.com/news/eu-sanctions-iran-revolutionary-guards-over-crackdown) said on Thursday. Hossein Salami made the comment during the funeral procession of Brigadier General [Razi Moussavi](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-guards-vow-revenge-against-israel-generals-killing), a prominent IRGC commander who was assassinated by Israel last Monday in [Syria](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/syrias-stakes-israel-gaza-war). In a speech to the crowd gathered in Tehran, Salami denied the claim that the [ Al-Aqsa Flood operation](https://www.newarab.com/opinion/six-israeli-failings-which-led-al-aqsa-flood) carried out by Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades had been revenge for the US' assassination of the late General Qasem Soleimani, who led the IRGC's Quds Force. That claim had reportedly been made by IRGC spokesman Brigadier General Ramadan Sharif, who had been widely quoted as saying that Hamas' assault on US-backed Israel was in retaliation for the [assassination of Soleimani](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/significance-qasem-soleimanis-assassination), which took place in 2020. Hamas has strongly denied such claims, reiterating that it acted upon its own, independent decision. Salami added that the IRGC spokesman had clarified to him that he had meant that the results of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation acted as vengeance for the death of Soleimani, who Washington assassinated in an airstrike in Baghdad. He said that the IRGC owns up to its actions in other countries. \"We are honest in our actions and we are a capable country. When we shot down an American drone (2019), we announced it, and we also demonstrated that when we arrested American soldiers (2016 in the Gulf), in addition to targeting the US Ain al-Asad base (2020 in Iraq), and the den of the Zionists,\" he said, his last example in reference to [strikes on a base near Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-says-missiles-targeted-israeli-site-iraqs-erbil). In an exclusive interview with The New Arab's Arabic-language sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed on Wednesday, Sharif said that his comments had been \"misunderstood\". \"I did not suggest that the motive behind the Al-Aqsa Flood was revenge for the blood of General Soleimani\", Sharif said, claiming that he had in fact stated that one of the results of the operation was revenge for Soleimani's death. Al-Qassam Brigades militants launched a large-scale attack on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,100 people, according to Israeli figures. They also took around 250 captives, 129 of whom remain in Gaza, Israel says. Since the attack, Israel has intensively bombarded Gaza, killing more than 21,000 people.

    "text": "Excelsior Correspondent SUCHETGARH, July 11: J&K Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary and DDC Member Suchetgarh, TS Tony has urged the Lt Governor Manoj Sinha to waive off the electricity bills of the farmers residing closer to zero-line (IB). He said that the farmers residing in the sensitive border areas playing a crucial role in bolstering the morale and operational capabilities of the armed forces and BSF during challenging border situations. During this visit to BOP Chhawani at zero line along the India-Pakistan border in Sei Khurd Panchayat, Tony emphasized the invaluable contribution of zero line farmers, highlighting their steadfast support to the security forces deployed in these critical zones. He underscored the waiving off their electricity bills would not only alleviate their financial strain but also enhance their ability to sustain agricultural activities vital to the region’s economy and security. “Zero line farmers are the backbone of our border defence strategy, providing essential support to our brave soldiers and security personnel. It is imperative that we recognize and support their sacrifices by ensuring they are not burdened with unnecessary financial obligations,” he added. The senior Congress leader further stressed that easing the financial burden on these farmers would reinforce the Government’s commitment to enhancing border security efforts and ensuring the well-being of those living in sensitive border regions. He urged Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to consider this proposal earnestly, emphasizing that it would not only benefit the farmers directly but also contribute significantly to the overall security infrastructure of the region. Earlier, DDC Member along with officials from the PDD including XEn Ashok Chibber, AEE Rajiv Kaul conducted a visit to the areas along India-Pakistan border at BOP Chhawani in Sai Khurd and Sei Kalan in Suchetgarh constituency and took stock of damaged poles, which affected electricity infrastructure in the area. Recognizing the importance of restoring power supply swiftly, Tony emphasized that uninterrupted electricity is essential, especially during the paddy season for irrigation, given the constraints faced with water supply from the Ranbir canal. The XEn PDD assured expediting the restoration work. Several Sarpanches were also accompanied them.",
