Judy Weinstein Haggai, a 70-year-old American-Israeli dual citizen, was confirmed dead on Thursday, roughly a week after her husband, Gadi, was also [declared](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/22/american-hostage-hamas-dead-gaza/) to have died, Israel National News [reported](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/382714). There are approximately six American hostages remaining in Gaza, [according](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/hamas-hostages-israel-gaza-41432124?mod=world_lead_story) to The Wall Street Journal.

Their bodies remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza.

Judy was an English teacher who worked with special needs children, [and](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kibbutz-says-gadi-haggai-abducted-oct-7-died-in-hamas-captivity-body-held-in-gaza/) Gadi was a musician and retired chef. “[Judy was] a poet and an entrepreneur who loved to create and was dedicated to working for peace and friendship,” Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a statement on Thursday, according to The Times of Israel. “[Gadi was] a musician at heart, a gifted flautist, he played in the IDF Orchestra and was involved with music his whole life,” The Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum said in a statement reported on Friday. Hamas is currently holding about 129 hostages in Gaza, 118 of whom are Israeli citizens or dual citizens, and 23 of whom are believed to be dead in captivity, according to The Wall Street Journal. A previous short-term truce deal between Hamas and Israel allowed for the release of over 100 hostages, but it [ended](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/01/israel-hamas-war-reignites-truce-extension/) after Hamas broke the terms of the deal. Getting the remaining hostages out is “going to be a long process,” President Joe Biden said on Dec. 5, according to the WSJ. The U.S. has been [working](https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/28/cia-director-lands-qatar-secret-talks-israeli-intelligence-over-additional-hostage-releases/) with Israel and Qatar to try and strike another temporary truce agreement with Hamas to allow for the release of the remaining hostages.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere. Advertisement - story continues below Democrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border. Their standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life. None of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.

    "text": "Every summer since I was born, my family has spent time camping in Jasper. I grew up wandering the townsite, hunting for wild strawberries along the Athabasca River, hiking Old Fort Point and Valley of the Five Lakes, and playing tour guide for friends and family from across the country and world. For most of my adult life, it’s impossible to miss the fact that wildfires and smoke are getting increasingly worse. I don’t remember smoke days impacting our summer camping trips when I was a kid. But over the past 10 years, the question has been not if there will be sweeping wildfires, but when. I feel a deep sense of sorrow and solidarity with the residents of Jasper who have been evacuated, whose homes and beloved places have been burned, and who are reckoning with the aftermath of the fire that rampaged through their community. The outpouring of support for Jasper and other communities impacted by wildfires has been inspiring, but it has also been infuriating to watch politicians show up just to briefly connect with evacuees and express their grief. Prime Minister Trudeau and Premier Danielle Smith knew disasters like the fire in Jasper were coming. They might not have known where and when the fires might hit, but even the Government of Canada’s own Department of Natural Resources had already foreseen [an increasing risk of wildfires](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/simply-science/canadas-record-breaking-wildfires-2023-fiery-wake-call/25303) due to climate change and the resulting record-high temperatures. So, despite the science, despite demands from communities affected by fires, floods, droughts, and heat waves, why aren’t our politicians doing anything meaningful about the climate crisis? The climate is changing, so why aren’t we? People and organizations like ours have been working for decades to hold our decision-makers accountable and inspire them to take bold climate action to protect the people and communities they represent. In the wake of the massive climate marches that swept the country in 2019, which had Justin Trudeau’s government promising Just Transition legislation, things felt hopeful. But in the years since, we’ve seen our MPs and the Liberal government drag their feet on any sort of meaningful climate action – that same Just Transition legislation promised five years ago only passed in June 2024 and is significantly weaker than what we know is possible. Similarly, the federal government only just introduced emissions cap regulations that are [riddled with loopholes for industry](https://environmentaldefence.ca/2024/01/23/capping-oil-and-gas-emissions-we-have-the-framework-now-where-do-we-go-from-here/) and has been [silent on its promise to end fossil fuel subsidies in Canada](https://environmentaldefence.ca/2024/08/02/tell-pm-trudeau-to-stop-funding-fossil-fuels-and-keep-his-promise/). In Alberta, things are even worse. Danielle Smith and her United Conservative Party government are actively opposed to any policy that hinders the oil and gas industry responsible for the climate crisis. Last summer, the government imposed a moratorium on renewable energy projects that [cost Alberta municipalities $91 million in tax revenue and saw the cancellation of 53 renewables projects](https://financialpost.com/pmn/alberta-renewable-energy-pause-has-left-legacy-of-cancelled-development-study), enough to power every house in the province and then some. The Alberta government has also slashed funding for [the wildfire service by about $30 million](https://pressprogress.ca/albertas-ucp-government-has-cut-tens-of-millions-of-dollars-from-wildfire-preparedness-programs/) in the last few years. It’s also well-documented that forest management has been focused on profit for the forestry industry rather than fire prevention or community-oriented forestry. These factors, in addition to the climate crisis, have contributed to challenges in managing fires in the Alberta. Last year, the provincial government spent over $1 billion to respond to one of the worst fire seasons on record. While the Alberta government has increased the wildfire response budget this year by $55 million, that is a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of years of climate denial and profit-motivated policymaking, this year and into the future. Both the Liberal foot-dragging on climate policy and the actively hostile Conservative stance on the climate crisis make one thing clear: despite the increasing disasters, despite hearing from millions of concerned people across the country, our politicians are not listening to us or to climate science. So, who are they listening to? Or a better question: who benefits from toothless climate policies and cutting public and emergency services? When making decisions that could keep these fires from getting worse, our politicians are listening to fossil fuel CEOs and their designates. Corporate executives and their shareholders are the people who benefit from weak climate legislation that enables them to expand their business, pumping even more emissions into the atmosphere, and creating the conditions for other industries to continue profiting from the chaos. There are oily fingerprints all over the decision to put a moratorium on renewables in Alberta. Similarly, we know for a fact that the federal government didn’t introduce a windfall tax on oil and gas companies [specifically because the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers lobbied against it](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-federal-budget-to-include-tax-hikes-for-wealthiest-canadians-some/?_ga=2.75116178.1807810234.1723665155-261676783.1723665155). This is not the first time that CAPP has directly undercut climate policy – in 2012 CAPP lobbied for much of the [environmental deregulation under the Harper government](https://thenarwhal.ca/capp-hesitant-admit-request-holistic-overhaul-environmental-legislation-influenced-omnibus-budget-bill-internal-documents/), and at the onset of the pandemic they [lobbied successfully for suspension of dozens of climate monitoring and labour laws](https://canadians.org/analysis/big-oil-lobby-group-asks-feds-suspend-environmental-laws-meet-secret/). [Pathways Alliance, an oil and gas lobby group, recently put out a release stating that they cannot meet their emissions goals unless the federal government rolls back a new law](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/pathways-alliance-bill-c-59-competition-act-richard-masson-1.7281083) that requires environmental claims made by companies to be real – which begs the question of how long this law will remain in effect. This corporate powerplay is clear from the [hundreds of meetings our elected officials have with the fossil fuel industry every year](https://environmentaldefence.ca/2024/08/13/big-oils-relentless-lobbying-efforts-are-obstructing-climate-progress-on-parliament-hill/), while ordinary people are the ones being evacuated from their homes because of fires and flooding, or while loved ones are going to the emergency room for heatstroke. It is impossible to ignore that the fossil fuel industry is getting tens of billions of dollars to build things like the Trans Mountain Pipeline and subsidies for false climate solutions, while the cost of keeping communities safe isn’t even close to being covered by the wildfire budget and communities have to rely on an emergency contingency fund instead. It’s time to make them listen to us Whenever there is a climate disaster like the fires in Jasper, there is always a chorus of people telling us we shouldn’t politicize tragedy. This reminds me of a song called [Super Subtle Folk Song](https://geoffberner.bandcamp.com/track/super-subtle-folk-song) by Vancouver musician Geoff Berner: It is absolutely critical to listen to the needs that communities have when they’ve been hit by a climate disaster, and it is important to address the cause of the disaster in the first place. If we want change, we need to move politicians to confront their cozy relationships with the oil and gas industry and its lobbyists, and make conversations about corporate responsibility for the climate crisis a welcome part of climate discourse in Canada. Together, as the people at the forefront of figuring out the climate problems we face, we have a chance to write a new and powerful story of change ourselves. Together, we must demand that our politicians put their money where their mouths are and make our democracy work for who its supposed to: us. If you have been affected by the fires in Jasper, or anywhere else in Canada, and want to take action to push corporate interests out of climate policy-making, please [write to me directly](mailto:ckruszewski@canadians.org).",

    "text": "This easy broccoli salad recipe is quick to make and loaded with tastes and textures you’ll love. A crowd-pleasing option, it’s the perfect side dish for family gatherings and celebrations!\nTable of Contents\nPin this now to find it later\nWhy you’ll love this broccoli salad recipe\nThe first time I ever had this broccoli bacon salad was at my friend’s daughter’s first birthday party. The birthday girl’s great-grandmother, Linda, prepared it, and it was so good that everyone went back for seconds!\nThankfully, she was happy to share the recipe, and it has been a staple at my own family gatherings ever since.\n- Quick – Preparing the bacon is the only actual cooking you need to do. Then, all that’s left is chopping the veggies and combining everything!\n- Large batch – One batch makes enough for up to 8 servings and can easily be doubled or even tripled for a hungry crowd.\n- Make ahead – This broccoli salad with grapes actually tastes better as it sits, meaning it’s perfect for assembling a day or so in advance!\nFeel free to mix and match the ingredients to make this broccoli salad recipe your own! Enjoy it as a side dish, or add your favorite protein for an easy meal prep option. No matter what you really can’t go wrong.\nKey Ingredient Notes\n- Sugar – A tiny pinch of granulated sugar balances the tang of the dressing for a well-rounded taste.\n- Bacon – Cooked bacon adds a bit of crunch and a delicious savory, salty flavor. I use center-cut pork bacon, but turkey bacon will also work if you need to keep this recipe pork-free.\n- Broccoli – You can’t have broccoli salad without broccoli! I buy whole heads of broccoli and chop them myself. However, you can also use ready-to-eat chopped florets if you want to cut down a bit of the prep time.\n- Red onion – Chopped finely, this adds extra texture and a bit of tang.\n- Grapes – Use red grapes instead of green grapes for a sweet taste.\n- Craisins – These are sweetened dried cranberries that add a bit of chewy texture and a sweet taste to the salad. Raisins also work well if you have them on hand.\n- Sunflower seeds – Use plain or roasted salted sunflower seeds without the shell. Or, substitute slivered almonds or chopped walnuts for a similar taste and texture.\n- Mayo – This forms the base of the dressing. Make sure to use full-fat mayo, not lite varieties! Linda, the creator of this recipe, recommended using Hellamn’s.\n- Red wine vinegar – Use this to add a subtle tang to the dressing. Apple cider vinegar will also work and adds a slight apple flavor.\nHow to make broccoli salad\n1. Cook the bacon\n- Cut the bacon into small pieces.\n- Cook it in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until it’s nice and crispy, about 8 minutes.\n- Transfer the cooked pieces to a paper towel-lined plate.\n2. Prep the produce\n- Cut the broccoli into small bite-sized pieces.\n- Mince the red onion.\n- Cut the grapes in half.\nDry the produce\nMake sure all the produce is dry before combining the ingredients, or your salad is likely to become soggy!\n3. Make the dressing and mix\n- Whisk the mayo, sugar, and red wine vinegar in a separate bowl until smooth.\n- Pour the dressing over the broccoli salad.\n- Toss to combine and coat the ingredients.\n- Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTips for Success\n- Cut your broccoli into small bite-sized pieces so that it’s easy to eat and you get a little bit of everything in each bite.\n- Add the sunflower seeds just before serving to keep them nice and crunchy.\n- Eyeball the amount of mix-ins included, adding as little or as much as you like.\n- Chill your broccoli salad in the fridge before serving to allow the flavors to soak in and meld together.\nMake-Ahead Tips\nThis cold broccoli salad recipe is great to prepare in advance. In fact, I think it tastes even better the next day!\nJust combine all the ingredients, store the salad in an airtight container in the fridge, and give it a good stir before serving.\nIt’s not totally necessary, but I recommend leaving out the sunflower seeds until you’re ready to eat to prevent them from becoming soggy.\nStoring Tips\nStore leftover broccoli salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. I don’t recommend freezing it, because it will become soggy once thawed!\nFAQs:\nYes, broccoli can be eaten raw and provides a nice crunch when served in salads uncooked.\nBroccoli salad can get watery if the broccoli is wet. So, make sure to dry it well before adding it to the salad!\nFeel free to use a different dressing, or add seasonings like garlic powder, onion powder, or smoked paprika. Experiment to find what you like best!\nThe BEST Broccoli Salad\nIngredients\n- 1 lb bacon\n- 1 head broccoli washed\n- ½ red onion\n- 2-3 cups seedless grapes washed\n- 1 cup craisins\n- ½ cup sunflower seeds\n- Salt & pepper to taste\nDressing:\n- 1 cup mayo\n- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n- ¼ cup sugar\nInstructions\n- To cook the bacon, cut bacon into small pieces.\n- In a medium skillet, cook chopped bacon over medium high heat until nice and crispy, about 8 minutes. Remove bacon bits onto a plate, lined with a paper towel.\n- To prep the veggies, cut the broccoli into small bite-size pieces.\n- Mince red onion.\n- Cut the grapes in half.\n- In a large bowl, combine chopped broccoli, bacon, onion, grapes, craisins and sunflower seeds.\n- To make the dressing, whisk mayo, sugar and red wine vinegar until smooth.\n- Pour the dressing over the prepared salad ingredients and mix well. Salt and pepper to taste.\nTips & Notes\n– You can make this broccoli salad a day in advance.\n– Refrigerate until ready to serve. The leftover salad is good, refrigerated, for 3-4 days.\n– I don’t recommend freezing this recipe!",

De acuerdo con el informe de la Policía Metropolitana de Bucaramanga, Santiago Rodríguez Mejía, un vigilante de 43 años, fue baleado por Jaime Antonio Álvarez Sánchez, el dueño de una camioneta Toyota de placas NYL-478, matriculada en Villa del Rosario.\nLe recomendamos leer: Niña de 8 años murió en enfrentamiento de policías y manifestantes\nLa agresión ocurrió sobre las 9:10 de la noche del martes 8 de abril, minutos después de que el guarda de seguridad le reclamara al conductor del vehículo por estacionar de manera errónea en la carrera 36 con calle 52-69.\nJaime Álvarez, el dueño de la camioneta, ofuscado, se acercó al vigilante y lo golpeó. Para defenderse, Santiago, el celador, desenfundó su bolillo, y arremetió contra su agresor.\nAnte la gravedad de la gresca, un hombre, vestido con camisa blanca, y una mujer se interpusieron para mediar entre ambos. Sin embargo, el vigilante logró zafarse y golpeó el panorámico de la camioneta. Esta acción desató la ira de Jaime Álvarez, el dueño del vehículo, quien, sin remordimiento, le disparó en la pierna izquierda a Santiago.\nToda la agresión quedó registrada en una cámara de seguridad del sector. Cuando el vigilante se percató de que el proyectil se había incrustado en su extremidad pidió apoyo a los transeúntes que presenciaron el hecho. El cuadrante de la policía del sector Cabecera llegó a tiempo y logró detener a Jaime Álvarez, antes de que escapara en su camioneta. El sujeto fue puesto a disposición de las autoridades por el delito de lesiones personales.\nNo olvide leer: Juan Carlos Pérez Arias, el motociclista que murió en grave choque en Bucaramanga\nAfortunadamente, el vigilante no sufrió una lesión que comprometiera su vida.",

This update has the potential to boost investor confidence and positively impact the company's stock price. The positive drilling results indicate that the company is making progress in its mining operations, which could lead to increased production and revenue in the future.\nOn May 5, 2025, [hycroft mining] announced their Q1 2025 earnings. The financial performance reported in this earnings call is likely to influence the stock price. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's revenue, earnings per share, and other key financial metrics to assess the company's performance and future prospects.\nHycroft Mining's stock has shown positive market movements, with a recent gain of about 9.5% on a single day.

He also reflected on the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl LVIII victory over the 49ers.\n\"The San Francisco 49ers are the only franchise I played for in the NFL, and they have the best fans in the world,\" Willis said . \" Maybe I am a little biased, but we have some of the best fans in the world, and anytime I have the opportunity to be with them, be around them, celebrate with them . It's always a great time; we had some great times together . Even though I saw him during the season, a little bit more than usual, I'm looking forward to this event (Verizon's Super Bowl FanFest) tremendously .\"\nVerizon Super Bowl FanFest is coming to 30 cities. FREE tickets. #VerizonFanFest https://t.co/gbBOQlwUzi pic.twitter.com/JByOvqKxay\n— Verizon (@Verizon) January 3, 2025 Willis, who played his eight-year career with the 49ers from 2007-2014, reflected on last season's Super Bowl run for San Francisco while being announced as a 2024 Pro Football Hall of Fame class member.\n\"I got chills; that was a special month, a special game, a special moment,\" Willis explained. \"O utside of being announced for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, all while having the team that you know, blood, sweat, and tears for in the Super Bowl , it was an amazing time . I will say that, man, I thought it was just they were right there, you know, again . I know that feeling of just being that close . I thought maybe this would be the moment that play would happen, and the Niners would be able to win that sixth Super Bowl that put us, I think, put us right at the top, or with the top for most Super Bowl wins in NFL history . So it was a tough moment.\"\nThe Chiefs won the thrilling game in overtime 25-22, with Patrick Mahomes connecting with Mecole Hardman for a touchdown, as Willis believes a key San Francisco injury affected the outcome.\n\"On top of that, I'm a big Dre Greenlaw and Fred Warner fan, and I think that seeing Dre have his injury, as he did at a pivotal time, was a big difference,\" Willis said. \" I feel like things shifted a little bit when he went out of the game . It was unfortunate . But , man, it's like that: you get that close and don't get it done . Especially as you get older, it gets a little bit tougher each year to dig in again and go back at it . But they didn't get it done . Unfortunately , they didn't; as Deebo (Samuel) says, they had a Super Bowl hangover . So you know, this year didn't go as go as well . Didn't go well at all . They have a chance to bounce back this off-season and get some things right.\"\nVisit VerizonFanFest.com for a full list of events and locations and access to free tickets on a first-come, first-served basis . FanFests across the country will take place on Sunday, February 9, beginning at 4pm ET / 1pm PT.",

De acuerdo con el mandatario estadounidense, los niveles de violencia, sumados al desplazamiento forzado de personas y la destrucción de propiedades, representan también “una grave amenaza a la paz, la seguridad y la estabilidad de Cisjordania y Gaza, Israel y la región de Oriente Próximo”. “Estas acciones socavan los objetivos de política exterior de Estados Unidos, incluida la viabilidad de una solución de dos Estados y garantizar que israelíes y palestinos puedan alcanzar medidas iguales de seguridad, prosperidad y libertad“, apunta Biden en una nota difundida por la Casa Blanca. En este contexto, Biden ordenó sanciones contra las propiedades de aquellas personas señaladas por la Administración como responsables o cómplices de acciones violentas en Cisjordania o que atenten contra la seguridad de la población local; o que hayan trabajado para empresas que desarrollen estas acciones. Por su parte, el asesor de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca, Jake Sullivan, señaló que el presidente Biden ha reiterado en numerosas ocasiones el derecho de Israel a defenderse de los ataques del Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás) de comienzos de octubre, que dejaron casi mil 200 muertos.

El asesor de Seguridad Nacional destacó que la orden ejecutiva de Biden permitirá emitir sanciones financieras contra quienes dirijan o participen en actos de violencia, intimidación o desplazamiento forzado de civiles, o participen en actos terroristas en Cisjordania. “El Departamento de Estado también anunciará hoy un conjunto inicial de designaciones bajo esta nueva orden ejecutiva“, adelantó un Sullivan que destaca que esta medida adoptada por Biden “busca promover la paz y la seguridad tanto para israelíes como para palestinos“.

    "text": "Sandra Silva usou a sua conta no Instagram para partilhar um vídeo com o filho, Vasco, a brincar no parque. No texto que acompanha a gravação, a influenciadora digital deixa uma reflexão sobre parentalidade, revelando o que motivou a ideia de irem para o parque brincar com o menino, de dois anos. \"As crianças precisam de brincar e precisam de nós. É isto que leio, é isto que me dizem os profissionais que nos seguem e principalmente, é isto que vejo no Vasco todos os dias. Ele quase não vê ecrãs, mas também vê, se calhar mais vezes do que devia. Não todos os dias, mas alguns minutos por semana. E está tudo bem com isso, sem julgamentos\", começou por escrever. \"Hoje pediu para ver e eu senti que ele estava frustrado, já não sabia com o que brincar em casa... porque passámos o dia em consultas, restaurante, visita a uma loja.. e quando ele pediu os 'dinoxauros' (os bonecos que gosta), disse ao João 'e se fôssemos ao parque, já que temos o jantar pronto?' O Vasco rapidamente disse 'siiim, parque' e não pediu mais para ver os bonecos. E assim foi. O resultado? Está à vista!\", continuou, explicando depois que nem sempre é fácil ter disponibilidade para abraçar este tipo de programas. \"Se temos esta disponibilidade física, mental e de tempo todos os dias? Não, não temos. Tentamos ser pais conscientes mas somos humanos, (im)perfeitos à nossa maneira e às vezes não nos apetece simplesmente ir para o parque. Como provavelmente acontece por aí também… Uma certeza? Fazemos todos o nosso melhor todos os dias, tenho a certeza que vocês também!!\", concluiu.",

    "text": "NEW YORK , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Outlook\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: OTLK ) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey , and docketed under 23-cv-21862, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Outlook securities between December 29, 2022 and August 29, 2023 , both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b -5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.\nIf you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired Outlook securities during the Class Period, you have until January 2, 2024 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com . To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at [email protected] or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.\n[Click here for information about joining the class action]\nOutlook is a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing monoclonal antibodies for various ophthalmic indications. The Company's lead product candidate is ONS-5010, an ophthalmic formulation of the antibody bevacizumab for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (\"wet AMD\") and other retina diseases.\nIn August 2021 , Outlook announced the topline readout of data from its pivotal Phase 3 NORSE TWO trial of ONS-5010 for the treatment of wet AMD. According to the Company, this data, among other things, \"demonstrated clinically relevant and highly statistically significant results\" that supported the submission of a biologics license application (\"BLA\") to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for ONS-5010 for the treatment of wet AMD (the \"ONS-5010 BLA\"), which the Company planned to submit to the FDA in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn March 2022 , Outlook announced that it had submitted the ONS-5010 BLA to the FDA. Thereafter, in May 2022 , the Company voluntarily withdrew the ONS-5010 BLA to provide additional information requested by the FDA. Following receipt of further correspondence from the FDA, the Company purportedly \"confirmed the additional information necessary to re-submit the BLA for ONS-5010\" and resubmitted the BLA in August 2022 .\nThe Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) there was a lack of substantial evidence supporting ONS-5010 as a treatment for wet AMD; (ii) Outlook and/or its manufacturing partner had deficient chemistry manufacturing and controls (\"CMC\") and other manufacturing issues for ONS-5010, which remained unresolved at the time the ONS-5010 BLA was re-submitted to the FDA; (iii) as a result of all the foregoing, the FDA was unlikely to approve the ONS-5010 BLA in its present form; (iv) accordingly, ONS-5010's regulatory and commercial prospects were overstated; and (v) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn August 30, 2023 , Outlook issued a press release announcing that the FDA had issued a complete response letter to the ONS-5010 BLA. The Company advised that, \"[w]hile the FDA acknowledged the NORSE TWO pivotal trial met its safety and efficacy endpoints, the Agency concluded it could not approve the BLA during this review cycle due to several CMC issues, open observations from pre-approval manufacturing inspections, and a lack of substantial evidence.\"\nOn this news, Outlook's stock price fell $1.141 per share, or 80.92%, to close at $0.269 per share on August 30, 2023 .\nPomerantz LLP, with offices in New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , London , Paris , and Tel Aviv , is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

    "text": "Oddly enough, I am excited to live in a state that actually gets weather. Winter is not my favorite of seasons, but in Alabama, it's so short that you can ride with it without too much inconvenience. Like much of the country, we will be experiencing some freezing temperatures and maybe even some ice. There are bridges and waterways all over the state, so I imagine that things will come to a standstill, and the natives tell me that people pretty much lose their minds. Instead of toilet paper, there seems to be a run on milk, white bread, and eggs. French toast, perhaps? In any event, I can't really blame them. So, I stocked up on eggs and milk (I don't eat bread) and figured I will just avoid driving for a few days to be on the safe side. That's the beauty of having a job where you can work from home. But others are not so fortunate, especially when you live in states in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest. BLIZZARD: The first blizzard warning in 8 years has been issued in eastern Idaho -- for almost everyone. It starts Thursday at around 5 p.m. SPREAD THE WORD AND STAY INDOORS!— East Idaho News (@EastIDNews) [https://t.co/Lg923SZe7y] [January 11, 2024] Avoiding the weather in a place like Idaho, for example, is a near impossibility. They get the snow, the ice, and sometimes it's not so nice. However, if you run into trouble, let's hope you are discovered by these winter Samaritans who helped a poor mother and her two young children [escape an icy embankment](https://www.eastidahonews.com/2024/01/a-feel-good-friday-surprise-for-4-men-who-helped-a-young-mom-trapped-in-a-car-on-the-edge-of-an-embankment/) unharmed. She wrote: I was driving home with my toddler and baby when I slid and was on the edge of an embankment. I was worried I would roll my car if I let off the pedal or moved the wheel so I just kept still. My mom was behind me and was able to get my baby out of the car when a guy pulled up and asked how he could help. He grabbed some straps and he and some other co-workers came and helped pull me out. One of the guys gave me his jacket to keep warm and continued to help get my car out in a short sleeve shirt. It was a Friday after 4:30 p.m. and they were headed home from work but took the time to help me. They were employees of Knife River and were so kind and generous. I was so worried about my babies and I’m thankful they were willing to help me quickly and with so much kindness! Winter Samaritans are the best. To have the wherewithal and skill to safely maneuver a metal vehicle off the ice and onto a safe road is quite a feat. This young mom wrote to Nate Eaton of East Idaho News, and even though she didn't know their names, he tracked them down in order to thank them for getting her out of her dilemma. Kyle Gubler, Johnathan Barron, Andy Vegas, and Sean Adams were honored for their selfless sacrifice. Three of them were on their way home and one was still on his shift, but they wanted to ensure this momma and her babies made it home safety. They are not only a good neighbors, but stellar humans too. Sometimes, inclement weather brings out the best in us.",
