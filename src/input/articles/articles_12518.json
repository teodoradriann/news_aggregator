    "title": "US security adviser says $ 61 bn aid will enable Ukraine's counteroffensive in 2025 - Euromaidan Press",
    "text": "Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Adviser, announced at the FT Weekend Festival in Washington on 5 May that Ukraine will look to mount a new counteroffensive in 2025, bolstered by a $61 billion US military aid, as this assistance will help to prevent further Russian territorial gains this year.\nLast fall, President Joe Biden requested $95 billion in foreign aid, including $60.8 billion for Ukraine, but Congressional Republicans stalled the proposal for six months. This delay weakened Ukraine’s defenses in the war with Russia, allowing Russia to capture territory and increase aerial attacks.\nAfter Congress’s approval, President Biden signed the aid bill into law on April 14, and the Pentagon announced the first aid package, yet Russia still continues to gain territory in places, as most of the matériel has not yet reached Ukrainian troops.\nDespite the substantial new US funding package approved last month , Sullivan anticipates Russian advances in the near future, acknowledging that “ you can’t instantly flip the switch .”\nHowever, he noted that the aid would enable Kyiv to maintain its defensive posture and ensure that Ukraine can withstand Russian assaults throughout 2024, and later in 2025, Ukraine intends “ to move forward to recapture the territory that the Russians have taken from them. ”\nSullivan’s comments on Ukraine’s potential 2025 counteroffensive, which hinges on additional Congressional funding and White House approval, underscore the White House’s strategic perspective should President Biden win re-election, contrasting with former President Trump’s skepticism and his preference for a negotiated settlement, FT notes.\nEarlier, Sullivan stated that the $61 billion aid package recently passed by Congress and signed by President Biden enables the US to support Ukraine until the end of the year.\nRead also:\nUkraine gets first weapons from latest US aid just 4 days after Biden’s signing – NYT Politico: With Ukraine aid secured, Biden to prioritize domestic economic messaging pre-election White House says US aid arriving in Ukraine but provides no further details ISW: Russian forces to make significant tactical gains before Ukraine stabilizes frontlines later on US Defense Secretary announces a $6 billion military aid package for Ukraine White House: US can sustain Ukraine aid through 2024 Ukrainian President grateful for US support, emphasizes need for swift action Pentagon officially announces rumored $1 bn military aid for Ukraine You could close this page.

    "text": "General Election 2024 Sir Keir Starmer is experiencing “something of a honeymoon period” with the public, a pollster has found, a week after the election. Voters’ impressions of the new Prime Minister have improved since his election victory, the survey by Ipsos found, with 40% saying they had a favourable view of Sir Keir. That figure is six points higher than in the last week of the campaign, while the number saying they had an unfavourable view of Sir Keir has fallen from 41% to 33%. The poll, carried out immediately after the election on July 5 and 6, is the first time Ipsos has given Sir Keir a net positive approval rating since the brief Liz Truss premiership in October 2022. There is no time to spare for the incoming Government when it comes to delivering on the public’s key priorities Ipsos director of politics Keiran Pedley It also ranks Sir Keir as the most popular of the major politicians about whom Ipsos asked voters, ahead of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, with a 33% favourable rating, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who both enjoy a 29% favourable rating. Ipsos director of politics Keiran Pedley said: “These findings suggest something of a honeymoon period for Keir Starmer, with more Britons favourable towards him than before the general election and Britons more likely to expect his Government to change things for the better than worse.” But he said that the Labour voters who put Sir Keir in Downing Street had “clear expectations of what they want to see delivered”, including more money for public services and improvements to the NHS. About four in five Labour voters thought it was likely the new Government would improve the NHS in the next year, while about three-quarters expected more spending on public services. Among people in general, 55% expected Labour to increase spending on public services in the next year, while 57% expected the party to improve the NHS. Mr Pedley said: “Therefore, there is no time to spare for the incoming Government when it comes to delivering on the public’s key priorities.” From news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "title": "Liberty Energy Navigates Headwinds with Resilient Q1 Performance",
    "text": "Liberty Energy Navigates Headwinds with Resilient Q1 Performance\nLiberty Energy Inc. (formerly Liberty Oilfield Services, NYSE: LBRT) delivered a Q1 2025 earnings report that underscored its resilience in a challenging market, balancing sequential growth with lingering year-over-year declines. While macroeconomic uncertainties and industry headwinds persist, the company’s focus on technology-driven efficiency, strategic diversification, and disciplined capital allocation positions it as a potential outperformer in the oilfield services sector.\nFinancial Highlights: A Mixed but Improving Picture\nLiberty reported $977 million in Q1 revenue, a 4% sequential increase from Q4 2024 but an 11% drop from Q1 2024. Despite the year-over-year decline, the results surpassed analyst expectations, with adjusted earnings of $0.04 per share beating the consensus estimate of $0.03. Sequential improvements in adjusted EBITDA—up 8% to $168 million—highlighted operational efficiencies, though margins remain pressured by lingering industry softness.\nNet income of $20 million ($0.12 per share) reflected ongoing cost discipline, even as debt under its ABL Facility rose to $210 million. The company maintained its shareholder-friendly approach, returning $37 million via $24 million in share repurchases and $13 million in dividends. Since July 2022, Liberty has retired 15.9% of its outstanding shares, with $270 million remaining under its buyback program.\nOperational Strengths: Technology and Market Share Gains\nThe quarter’s standout performance stemmed from fleet utilization improvements, which defied typical Q1 seasonal weakness. A “flight to quality” trend among producers—prioritizing reliable service providers—allowed Liberty to gain market share. Management emphasized technology advancements as a key differentiator:\n- digiPrime natural gas variable speed pump: Reduced emissions while maintaining performance.\n- AI-driven predictive maintenance: Extended equipment lifespan and lowered ownership costs.\n- Fleet modernization: Enhanced real-time data tools improved operational decision-making.\nThe acquisition of IMG Energy Solutions further diversified Liberty’s revenue streams, expanding into distributed power systems for non-oilfield sectors like data centers. This move aligns with the company’s strategy to mitigate cyclicality risks and capitalize on industrial electrification trends.\nStrategic Positioning Amid Industry Challenges\nCEO Ron Gusek framed Liberty’s performance as evidence of its “fortress balance sheet” and operational resilience. With $24 million in cash and $164 million in total liquidity, the company remains financially flexible to weather macroeconomic volatility.\nGuidance for Q2 2025 points to sequential revenue and profitability growth, driven by higher utilization and cost controls. However, risks persist, including geopolitical tensions, OPEC+ production dynamics, and potential tariff impacts. Liberty’s proactive measures—such as supply chain vertical integration—aim to mitigate these challenges.\nConclusion: A Steady Hand in Unsteady Markets\nLiberty Energy’s Q1 results demonstrate its ability to navigate a cyclical industry through innovation and strategic foresight. While YoY declines reflect broader sector pressures, sequential growth in revenue, EBITDA, and utilization signals a stabilization trajectory. The company’s 12% trailing twelve-month adjusted pre-tax ROCE, though subdued, underscores its operational discipline.\nCrucially, Liberty’s $270 million remaining buyback capacity and dividend policy—bolstered by a 15.9% reduction in shares outstanding since 2022—suggest continued shareholder value creation. The IMG acquisition and tech investments position the firm to capitalize on secular trends beyond oilfield services, further insulating it from commodity price swings.\nInvestors should monitor Liberty’s ability to sustain utilization gains and execute on its power services expansion. With a balanced sheet and a playbook for outperforming peers in downturns, Liberty Energy appears well-equipped to deliver long-term returns, even as macro risks linger.\nIn summary, Liberty Energy’s Q1 snapshot paints a picture of a company leveraging technology and diversification to stay ahead of industry headwinds. For investors seeking exposure to a financially disciplined oilfield services leader, this quarter’s results reinforce its case as a strategic holding.",

Around 300 feeders have tripped in the city. Three people were killed in rain-related incidents in the city,” officials said.\nFlight operations in Lahore too were suspended for several hours due to heavy rains.\nPunjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has directed the officials concerned to remain in the field 24/7 to drain out rainwater-inundated areas.\nThe PDMA said water levels in rivers, dams and streams are rising due to the monsoon rains. “Moderate to high-level flooding in the river Jhelum at Mangla from August 1 to 4 can be witnessed,” it said.\nIn all, 24 people were killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in incidents related to monsoon rains since July 29, taking the total of those killed in July itself to about 100-odd people across the country.

    "text": "Donald Trump will once again be addressing the press…\nAccording to a Fox News report, former President and 2024 GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump will be back out in front of the press taking questions on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\nThis is the second straight week the former president has grabbed headlines by holding a news conference. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris hasn’t held a press conference in 25 days since becoming the presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee.\nKamala’s campaign says there may be sit-down interviews eventually.\n“We will commit to directly engage with the voters that are actually gonna decide this election and that is gonna be complete with rallies, with sit-down interviews, with press conferences, with all the digital assets we have at our disposal,” Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler told CNN yesterday.\nTrump enthusiastically announced staff updates via a TRUTH Social post on Thursday, stressing that the enthusiasm surrounding his campaign is great:\nWe’re leading in almost all Polls, in some cases leading by A LOT, despite the fact that the Fake News is pulling out all stops for their Radical Left San Francisco Liberal, Kamala Harris. In 2016, we did well, and WON. In 2020, we got Millions of more Votes and actually did much better than 2016, but nothing compares to this year, 2024. The Enthusiasm is GREAT, and the Management Team, headed up by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, is THE BEST. Many people want to join the Campaign for the final push, some from the first two Campaigns – And we want as many as we can get! I am pleased to announce that Corey Lewandowski, who was very involved in 2016, will be coming on board as a Senior Advisor. Others, likewise, are joining us. They’ll be announced soon! Again, these 82 days will go down as the Most Important in Campaign History, and November 5th will be the Most Important Day in the History of our Country. We are a Nation in Decline, but we will soon be a Great Nation again!
