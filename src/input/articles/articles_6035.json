    "text": "Abstract\n[Conventional wet-electrode manufacturing encounters challenges in producing thicker electrodes due to issues related to solvent evaporation. This study introduces a novel method for fabricating solvent-free dry electrodes using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a binder, representing a significant advancement in electrode manufacturing processes. By eliminating the use of solvents, this method not only addresses these challenges but also offers a scalable and practical solution for mass production. The process is meticulously structured into sequential unit operations, each specifically tailored for a distinct function, utilizing the distinctive fibrillation properties of PTFE. Intermediate product specifications for each phase are clearly defined, accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of both physical and electrochemical performances. This analysis highlights the influence of varying PTFE contents and properties on the microstructure of the dry electrode. Notably, the study achieves a significant breakthrough with an electrode formulation of NCM811/PTFE/carbon black (CB)/carbon nanotube (CNT) = 96/2.0/1.8/0.2, which demonstrates exceptional discharge rate capability of 80 % at a 0.5 C-rate (5 mA/cm2) under the demanding parameters of 10 mAh/cm2 and 3.8 g/cc. This approach not only enhances the microstructural properties of dry electrodes but also paves the way for environmentally friendly and efficient electrode manufacturing for future energy storage applications.]\nA team of researchers, affiliated with UNIST has made a significant breakthrough in developing an eco-friendly dry electrode manufacturing process for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The new process, which does not require the use of harmful solvents, enhances battery performance while promoting sustainability.\nLed by Professor Kyeong-Min Jeong in the School of Energy and Chemical Engineering at UNIST, the research team has introduced a novel solvent-free dry electrode process using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a binder. This innovative approach addresses the challenges associated with traditional wet-electrode manufacturing methods, which often result in non-uniform distribution of binders and conductive materials, leading to performance degradation.\nFigure 1. Overview of dry electrode manufacturing process: unit processes, equipment, and intermediate products used in this study.\nThe dry electrode process is divided into four stages: granule formation, film formation, rolling, and lamination. The team optimized the process conditions by evaluating the physical, electrical, and electrochemical properties of semi-finished products at each stage. The results showed that a high-extrusion-ratio PTFE binder can produce an electrode film with high strength even with low energy consumption, leading to improved microstructure and power characteristics.\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram showing the fibrillation process of the PTFE binder with kneading time, photographs of the bulk shape, and SEM images of the microstructure of the electrode dough (F-208 2%).\nIn LIBs, binders play a crucial role in connecting active materials and electrons. The study revealed that the type and content of PTFE binders significantly impact the output characteristics of dry electrodes. The researchers identified an optimal formulation of NCM811/PTFE/carbon black (CB)/carbon nanotube (CNT) = 96/2.0/1.8/0.2, which demonstrated exceptional discharge rate capability of 80% at a 0.5 C-rate (5 mA/cm2) under demanding conditions.\n“This breakthrough will contribute to commercialization by providing a scalable and practical solution for mass production,” emphasized Professor Jeong. “We believe that our study will pave the way for environmentally friendly and efficient electrode manufacturing for future energy storage applications.”\nFigure 3. Film formation – roll mill – electrode film. (a) Schematic of the manufacture of electrode film from electrode granules using a roll mill. (b) Photographs of the electrode film by type and amount of PTFE after roll milling.\nThe findings of this research have been published in the July 2024 issue of Chemical Engineering Journal. It has been carried out through the support of the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST) and the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT).\nMeanwhile, the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) and Hanwha Co., Ltd. have also partnered with UNIST to develop dry electrode-specific manufacturing equipment and demonstrate its commercial viability from the second half of this year. The team is planning to further improve the output characteristics of thick electrodes by exploring various materials through follow-up research. With this innovative technology, electric vehicles and electronic devices are expected to become more sustainable in the future.\nJournal Reference\nHyeseong Oh, Gyu-Sang Kim, Byung Un Hwang, et al., “Development of a feasible and scalable manufacturing method for PTFE-based solvent-free lithium-ion battery electrodes,” Chemical Eng.

    "text": "By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States has assessed that Iran manufactured the drone that slammed into a U.S. base in Jordan over the weekend, killing three American soldiers and wounding more than 40, four U.S. officials told Reuters. Washington has blamed the attack - the first to kill U.S. troops in the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October - on Iran-backed militants, and President Joe Biden's administration has promised a multi-tiered response that will include strikes. But it has stopped short of publicly saying where the actual weapon that killed the Americans came from, even as it acknowledged Iran's ultimate responsibility for funding and even in some cases training the militants responsible. The officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, did not provide the model of the drone and said analysis was still ongoing. While the initial indications were that the drone was likely Iranian, a formal assessment was made only recently after recovering fragments of the drone. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, asked about the matter at a news briefing following the Reuters report, stopped short of confirming the drone's origin. \"We're still doing the forensics,\" Austin said. \"But most of the drones that are in the region have a connection with Iran. So ...\" Austin said he didn't know whether Iran knew about the attack ahead of time, but added that, in his view, it didn't matter. \"How much Iran knew or didn't know, we don't know. But it really doesn't matter because Iran sponsors these groups, it funds these groups, and in some cases, it trains these groups on advanced, conventional weapons,\" he said. Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia based in Iraq, said on Tuesday it was suspending military actions against the United States to avoid embarrassing the Baghdad government. Biden's administration said it was not seeking a war with Iran, even as Republican pressure on him to respond forcefully has been rising. Iranian officials have said Tehran will respond to any threat from the United States. Iran's envoy to the U.S. said Tehran would respond decisively to any attack on its territory, its interests, or Iranian nationals outside its borders. U.S. troops have been attacked more than 160 times in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since the events of Oct. 7 that triggered the war in Gaza, and warships have seen attacks in the Red Sea as well. Houthi fighters in Yemen have fired drones and missiles at them on the Red Sea ins solidarity with the Palestinians. Amid expectations of multiday strikes, Austin suggested it would take a multitiered response to address threats by Iran-backed groups against U.S. forces. \"I don't think the adversaries are of a one-and-done mindset,\" Austin told reporters. \"And so, they have a lot of capability. I have a lot more. ... We're going to do what's necessary to protect our troops and our interests.\" The attack in Jordan, and any U.S. response, is likely to stoke fears of wider conflict in the Middle East following the Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in which the Israeli authorities said 1,200 people were killed and 253 taken hostage. Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 27,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry. The United States has already retaliated in Iraq, Syria and Yemen in response to previous attacks by Iran-backed groups. Experts have cautioned that any strikes against Iranian forces inside Iran could force Tehran to respond, escalating the situation in a way that could drag the United States into a major Middle East war.

    "text": "“Non fate l’elemosina ai mendicanti”. Il cartello che indigna i fedeli in una chiesa di Padova Don Bizzotto dei Beati costruttori di pace: «Sono scandalizzato». L’Opera dell’Adorazione eucaristica perpetua di via Santa Lucia: «Gli accattoni gravitano notte e giorno qui intorno, disturbano e danno senso di insicurezza ai passanti» C’è chi è rimasto a fissarlo e chi ha commentato, andandosene sconcertato. La questione riguarda un cartello affisso in una chiesa di Padova in cui si chiede di non aiutare chi è in difficoltà. Esattamente le parole riportate sono le seguenti: «I fedeli sono pregati di non dare l’elemosina ai mendicanti in chiesa e nemmeno nei dintorni». Parole che stridono fortemente con il luogo in cui è stato appeso oltre che il periodo natalazio, in cui tutti si dovrebbe, sottolineando “dovrebbe”, essere più buoni e predisposti verso gli altri. La chiesa in questione è quella dell’Adorazione eucaristica perpetua di via Santa Lucia, in centro a Padova. «Sono scandalizzato, e mi dispiace che sotto Natale non ci sia posto per i poveri in chiesa», ha commentato al Mattino di Padova don Albino Bizzotto, presidente dell’associazione Beati costruttori di pace. La richiesta va contro i principi cristiani della solidarietà e dell’aiuto ai poveri. Ed è saltato all’occhio dei fedeli, provocandone l’indignazione. Ma l’Opera dell’Adorazione eucaristica perpetua sostiene con forza l’iniziativa: bandita non è l’elemosina, ha precisato, quanto la pratica dell’accattonaggio molesto. «La chiesa resta sempre aperta, 24 ore su 24. È per questo che noi abbiamo anche il compito di garantire il rispetto e il silenzio in tutti quei momenti di intimo raccoglimento dei fedeli», spiega una referente dell’opera religiosa al Mattino. «Essendo una chiesa sempre aperta e non una parrocchia, gli accattoni gravitano intorno al luogo di culto a tutte le ore e non solo durante le occasionali funzioni religiose, anche di notte. Questo ha portato problemi anche ai commercianti della zona che si sono lamentati per la presenza costante di gente che chiede l’elemosina”, ha concluso la referente. “Alcuni fedeli sono stati avvicinati in orari notturni da alcuni mendicanti molesti che in modo insistente hanno chiesto denaro, non solo disturbando i momenti di culto, ma diffondendo anche un certo senso di insicurezza». Ma per don Albino Bizzotto non ci sono scuse. «I poveri meritano attenzione soprattutto in questi giorni. Certo, va individuato l’opportunismo, ma non agire in modo generalizzato precludendo ai bisognosi la carità».",

Esto afecta tanto a los empleados como a los pacientes”, agregaron.\nHasta el momento, las autoridades del ISSS no han brindado una explicación detallada sobre el plan de remodelación ni han respondido a las inquietudes planteadas por los trabajadores.

    "title": "La ocupación hotelera llega en Córdoba al 70% en el puente con cancelaciones por las inundaciones en Valenc...",
    "text": "El rodar de maletas a través de las estrechas calles del Casco Histórico cordobés será su banda sonora durante el inminente Puente de Todos los Santos . Las reservas hablan de una media del 70 por ciento de ocupación hotelera en la capital, que se elevan por encima del 90 por ciento y rozan el lleno en algunos casos. Así lo pone de manifiesto el presidente de la Asociación de Empresarios de Hospedaje , Aehcor, Manuel Fragero, quien, no obstante, también señala que la trágica situación vivida en Valencia por las inundaciones causadas por la DANA «ha afectado a las comunicaciones, y se han registrado algunas cancelaciones ; además, las ventas están ahora paradas. Esperamos que remonten conforme se vaya normalizando todo». De hecho, varias carreteras del Estado en la región valenciana se encuentran cortadas y numerosos servicios de transportes han anulado su circulación . En concreto, el temporal ha dañado las infraestructuras ferroviarias y han obligado a suspender las conexiones de Alta Velocidad entre Valencia y Madrid, que tiene conexión con Córdoba. Esta ruta, y la circulación en el Corredor Mediterráneo, permanecerá inoperativa al menos hasta el domingo.Pese a ello, «los datos de ocupación son positivos y confiamos en que no haya más cancelaciones», indica el presudente de Aehcor. En cuanto a la procedencia de los visitantes, el grueso proviene de otros puntos del territorio nacional , algo que suele suceder en este puente de noviembre. Sin embargo, según detalla Fragero, «también está prevista la llegada de muchos extranjeros ; durante los próximos día es semana blanca en algunos países. Así, hablamos de un 60% de nacionales y de un 40% de foráneos». Noticia Relacionada Meteorología estandar No El tiempo para el puente de noviembre en Córdoba: estos son los días en los que lloverá Davinia Delgado Los chubascos serán muy puntuales y la estabilidad atmosférica será la tónica dominante durante las próximas jornadasLa situación, hotel por hotel, varía y mucho. Una muestra de ello es el Hospes Palacio del Bailío . Su director, Alberto Pérez, destaca los buenos números del establecimiento de cara al Puente de Todos los Santo: «El año pasado llenamos y este, vamos a repetir. A día de hoy sólo nos quedan dos habitaciones libres», afirma.En en Hospes, el grueso de clientes que tiran de los óptimos resultados son extranjeros. «De hecho, vamos a cerrar octubre con un 98,30% de ocupación y se debe a ellos. Además, se mantiene altísima hasta el 25 de noviembre», indica Pérez. Este cinco estrellas, uno de los dos que operan en la capital, cerrará un 2024 por encima de sus expectativas. «Tuvimos un febrero y un marzo muy potentes; y noviembre también lo será, a pesar de ser temporada baja. Contamos con un flujo de clientes americanos muy importante», valora el director del complejo, que se ubica en pleno centro histórico. Los turistas nacionales tiran de la mayoría de las reservasEn la misma línea se pronuncia el director del Parador de La Arruzafa , Manuel Merino. Pese a no ubicarse en el casco [se enclava en la avenida homónima], este establecimiento también cuenta ya con una elevada ocupación para el puente festivo de noviembre. «Estamos prácticamente en un 98 por ciento . A nosotros no nos están afectando las cancelaciones por lo sucedido en Valencia, al menos, por el momento», indica el máximo responsable de este establecimiento.Merino destaca las reservas por parte de madrileños y de visitantes de otros puntos del territorio nacional: «El 80% de los clientes que llegarán vienen de diversas ciudades de España». También de la comunidad madrileña proceden la mayoría de los turistas que se alojarán los próximos días en el hotel Macía Alfaros . «A partir mañana [viernes, 1 de noviembre], estaremos al 96, y el sabado, al 94. Aunque normalmente solemos tener muchos clientes de Francia, Holanda o Alemania, este puente suelen predominar los visitantes españoles », señalan desde su recepción. Algunos cuelgan el cartel de \\u0027completo\\u0027Otros establecimientos hoteleros consultados por este periódico, como NH Califa o Córdoba Centro , esperan, igualmente, un puente redondo. El primero, según informan, está al 95,38% de ocupación este 31 de octubre; al 90% el viernes y al 80% el sábado, «aunque esperamos que haya más reservas». Por su parte, Córdoba Centro está « completo hasta el lunes», apuntan, incluso con sorpresa, ya que «no suele ser usual algo así. Se debe a que no llega el domingo un grupo de americanos».De este modo, Córdoba saldrá muy bien parada de un festivo que ha estado en la cuerda floja por la previsión meteorológica. Así, la capital resulta beneficiada de la alta demanda de los destinos urbanos que se está registrando para el puente. Madrid, Sevilla y Roma encabezan las búsquedas de alojamientos, según los datos de Booking.com. La capital española lidera el interés de los viajeros nacionales, mientras que Sevilla ocupa el segundo lugar.",
