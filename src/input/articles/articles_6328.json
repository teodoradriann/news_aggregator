    "text": "- ‘Happy Australia Day’ is considered politically incorrect in light of its dark history - There are growing calls to change the date of the holiday - Tens of thousands are expected to protest across the country on Friday Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to Share! Wishing someone a ‘Happy Australia Day’ could be seen as insulting, according to Indigenous community advocates. Kado Muir, a leading advocate for Aboriginal culture, heritage and consciousness, said the phrase was an “ignorant gesture”. “This issue is extremely divisive and sensitive for all Australians,” Mr Muir told News LTD in 2019. “I know White Australia is guilty and vulnerable. I know Black Australia is broken and angry.” Leading advocate for Aboriginal culture, heritage and awareness Kado Muir (pictured) said the phrase ‘Happy Australia Day’ was an ‘ignorant gesture’ Prominent Aboriginal campaigner Cheree Toka (pictured) said many people were swapping the term ‘Australia Day’ for ‘Survival Day’ He called on Australians to rise above the “basic destructive emotions” in the debate and instead shift the focus to the aspects that unite the country. Leading Aboriginal campaigner Cheree Toka said many people were swapping the term ‘Australia Day’ for ‘Survival Day’. She said National Day of Remembrance on January 26 was a sad day for First Nations people. January 26 marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the ‘First Fleet’ at Sydney Cove, which carried mainly convicts and troops from Britain. For many Indigenous Australians, who trace their ancestry on the continent back 50,000 years, it is ‘Invasion Day’, the start of the British colonization of Aboriginal lands and their brutal subjugation. “Celebrating Australia Day on January 26 is insulting,” said Joe Williams, a mental health professional and former professional rugby league player. The ‘Change The Date’ movement has escalated in recent years as more and more protesters took to the streets of capital cities over the holiday to show their support for Indigenous Australians. Tens of thousands are expected to march across the country through the CBD on Friday, carrying the Aboriginal flag and banners calling for change. Major companies have also started to rethink their branding strategies as the campaign continues to gain momentum. The 28-year-old pushes for the Aboriginal flag to be flown atop the Sydney Harbor Bridge all year round (pictured, Ms Toka) Thousands of Australians are expected to protest the national holiday as Australia Day celebrations kick off today In December it was announced that 80 municipalities had decided to scrap citizenship ceremonies on January 26, amid growing divisions around the national holiday. Earlier this month, Woolworths sparked controversy after announcing it would no longer sell Australia Day merchandise. “Over recent years, demand for Australia Day merchandise from our stores has gradually declined. At the same time, there has been a broader discussion about January 26 and what it means for different parts of the community,” said the supermarket giant, which also owns Big W stores. ‘We know that many people like to use this day as a time to come together and we offer a wide variety of products to help customers celebrate the day as they choose. “Woolworths and BIG W celebrate the best of Australia every day, and we are proud to support the farmers, producers and suppliers who work with us.” Aldi later announced it would also not be stocking Australian-themed merchandise in its dedicated buying section this year. The supermarkets join Kmart after the discount retailer discontinued its Australia Day merchandise in 2023.",

    "title": "30 flights diverted, 100 delayed at IGI Airport due to bad weather",
    "text": "Flights were majorly diverted to Jaipur and Lucknow. New Delhi At least 30 flights were diverted from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport late Wednesday and over 100 were delayed, as intense rainfall and gusty winds hit operations till the early hours of Thursday, officials aware of the matter said. The first impact on flight schedules was reported at 7.30pm on Wednesday, with diversions made until 1am. However, officials said flights were delayed for longer due to the cascading effect of the diversions. “Flights had to be diverted to nearby airports, with the maximum – 15 flights being diverted to the Jaipur airport. This was followed by nine flights to the Lucknow airport,” an airport official said. Two flights were sent to Ahmedabad, three to Amritsar and one to Chandigarh. Bad weather on Wednesday night was a combination of wind shear, lightning and intense rain, meteorological officials said. Wind shear is clocked when strong winds with opposing directions and intensities occur during a storm, making it difficult for flights to land. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said winds touching 45kmph were recorded at Palam, the closest weather station to the airport, which recorded 68mm of rainfall between 5.30pm on Wednesday and 8.30am on Thursday. Officials said 16 IndiGo flights, six Air India flights and one each from Vistara, Alliance Air, Air India Express, American Airlines, Emirates, Akasa Air and Cathay Pacific, besides a chartered flight, were diverted. As over 100 flights were also delayed, airlines and travellers took to social media to share information and advisories. “Flights to and from Delhi may get affected due to bad weather this evening. Guests are advised to start early for the airport, as slow traffic and waterlogging may delay movement,” Air India posted on X. “Started at 7pm from Raipur to Delhi, was a direct flight for about 1.25 hours, however still not reached Delhi. Feeling lucky to enjoy such a long ride with no clue as to by when will get down from the aircraft,” Deepak Gupta, a passenger on-board a flight, said.

    "title": "California Governor Newsom Declares State of Emergency over Bird Flu from Dairy Cows",
    "text": "As more Californians have come down with bird flu — 33 people have caught it from dairy cows and one case is of unknown cause — state labs have increased the testing at dairy farms to such a degree that workers analyzing those tests at UC Davis raised the alarm over understaffing at their veterinary lab. To allow the state to add staff and flexibility in contracting and other rules, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Wednesday in response to Avian Influenza A.\nCalifornia’s is the largest testing and monitoring of dairies among the 17 states that have positively identified avian flu virus, or H5N1, in their dairy herds. The first lab to detect the virus in raw, unpasteurized milk sold on grocery shelves, however, was in Santa Clara County — at a well-funded public health lab in Silicon Valley — which prompted the state to double its testing at that dairy. Despite all precautions, after the November 24 recall of raw milk from Raw Farm, a second voluntary recall went out three days later, and by December 2, all Raw Farm products were under quarantine.\nPublic health officials have long regarded raw milk as potentially dangerous as it does not go through pasteurization that kills bacteria and viruses. Raw milk can contain germs that range from tuberculosis to E. coli from cow poop, but proponents believe it retains more healthful minerals and vitamins than the variety heated during pasteurization.\nAfter the recalled raw milk was first pulled from the shelves of a number of Santa Barbara grocery stores , Santa Barbara health official Dr. Henning Ansorg explained that it was highly unlikely for a person to become infected with H5N1 by simply drinking raw milk . If it contained the virus, it’d have to land in your eye or be aspirated deep into your lungs to reach receptors that H5N1 could attach to. This was theoretical, he added, and raw milk remained on the “not advisable” drinks list for the other serious illnesses it can cause.\nDr. Henning Ansorg | Credit: Daniel Dreifuss (file) In a press release this Thursday in response to the state of emergency declaration, Ansorg stated, “The risk to the general public remains low. There have not been any human cases of bird flu in Santa Barbara County at this time and we are closely monitoring the situation.” He added, “Out of an abundance of caution, we are asking residents to consume only pasteurized dairy products and to take additional precautions if working with birds or other animals.”\nAcross California health departments, the alarm level rose a notch when Alameda County reported on November 19 that a child with mild respiratory symptoms had tested positive for H5N1. No one knew how the child had contracted bird flu. Then Marin County reported on December 10 that a toddler who had drunk raw milk containing H5N1 was ill with fever and vomiting. Following California Public Health suggested protocol, Marin sent patient samples to the state lab and to the Centers for Disease Control, which found the samples had too little virus, or were too old, to distinguish everyday Influenza A virus from bird flu virus. The child’s family members did not become sick, which eliminated human-to-human transmission as a source, but the illness is listed as “suspected” H5N1.\nFor the scientists who track diseases, a mystery is never a good thing. While human transmission has never been known to happen since H5N1 was first isolated in China in 1997 — when avian flu had a 50 percent mortality rate among the people infected — every outbreak raises the concern that the virus may mutate toward easier human transmission.\nMost of the 61 H5N1 cases in the United States are in dairy or poultry workers, but several are of unknown origin. And until last Friday, U.S. cases were marked by mild symptoms that soon resolved. But a man in Louisiana was hospitalized with H5N1, state officials announced on December 13, adding that he was older than 65 and had underlying medical conditions that complicated his flu symptoms. They believe he caught H5N1 from sick or dead birds in his backyard flock. However, before this case, the other hospitalized patient was a healthy Canadian teenager who developed conjunctivitis and then a severe lung infection in late November. His vector of infection remains unknown.\nIn Santa Barbara, the Mosquito and Vector Control Management District monitors for mosquito-borne viruses, which do not include H5N1. However, biologist Brian Cabrera, general manager for Vector Control, said his staff pick up dead birds on a regular basis to test for encephalitis-causing viruses. They have been asked to be sure to wear protective gear. “You never know,” Cabrera said, “especially now with the increase in bird flu virus that’s circulating.”\nCabrera added that during the COVID pandemic, the governor’s emergency declaration enabled government groups to hold meetings remotely on video. This was the type of streamlining he expected to occur now.\nAs we all learned during COVID, viruses mutate. An October study published in Nature reported that the virus affecting the first known U.S. case — a dairy worker in Texas — had mutations that enabled it to be transmitted among the cows through airborne droplets. The researcher, Yoshihiro Kawaoka of University of Wisconsin-Madison, exposed ferrets to the virus which resulted in a 100 percent mortality rate.\nSusanne Rust, a reporter with the Los Angeles Times , interviewed experts who noted that the mutated virus in the Texas worker has disappeared, either because it stalled out in the eye — if that’s how he contracted it — or perhaps he’d had a previous bout with H1N1, the swine flu from 2009, which is similar enough to H5N1 for the body to set off an immune response.\nThe state Department of Public Health (CDPH) said the more than 30 H5N1 cases reported among California dairy workers indicates that raw milk can cause infections in humans. “While the overall risk to the public remains low,” the CDPH press office said, “bird flu viruses can change and gain the ability to spread more easily between people.”\nThis was thought to require multiple mutations, but Rust cited a new study in Science on December 5 that indicated only one change in the H part of H5N1 could open the door to widespread human infection.\nScripps Research Institute scientists James Paulson and Ian Wilson had tinkered with proteins on the surface of the virus, using information from outbreaks that had jumped the bird-human divide, Rust described. They found that a single mutation could accomplish this today. However, the same mutation had occurred in the past with no ill effects, Paulson said, as it was a slightly different virus then. It’s the nature of a virus to change and change again, so there’s a chance the Scripps experiment won’t be duplicated in the wild.\nWith roughly 1,300 dairy farms, the “nation-state of California,” as Newsom likes to say, produces about 20 percent of the nation’s milk. California is taking precautions to hold H5N1 back.\nRelated Posts RFK Jr. Was on Losing Side of California Vaccine Fights. Now, Trump Wants Him in His Cabinet By Ana B.

As India strides towards becoming a major player in the global energy transition, biodiesel plants across the country are playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of sustainable energy. The Rise of Biodiesel in India India, with its burgeoning population and rapidly growing economy, faces a unique set of challenges related to energy consumption and environmental sustainability. The country is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, which not only contribute to pollution but also pose significant risks to energy security. In response to these challenges, biodiesel has emerged as a viable solution. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel derived from organic materials such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste cooking oils. Unlike traditional diesel, which is produced from crude oil, biodiesel is made through a process called transesterification. This process converts fats and oils into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), which can be used as a cleaner-burning alternative to diesel. Advantages of Biodiesel - Environmental Benefits: Biodiesel offers significant environmental advantages over fossil fuels. It produces lower levels of harmful emissions such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. Moreover, biodiesel is biodegradable, reducing the risk of environmental contamination in case of spills. - Reduced Carbon Footprint: One of the key benefits of biodiesel is its ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon dioxide released during the combustion of biodiesel is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants used to produce the fuel. This creates a closed carbon cycle, contributing to a lower overall carbon footprint. - Energy Security: By producing biodiesel from domestic feedstocks, India can reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels. This enhances energy security and stabilizes fuel prices, which is crucial for a country with a growing demand for energy. - Economic Opportunities: The biodiesel industry has the potential to create numerous jobs and stimulate economic growth. From agricultural production of feedstocks to the establishment of biodiesel plants, the sector provides a range of employment opportunities and contributes to rural development. - Biodiesel Plants: A New Era in Sustainable Energy [Biodiesel plant in India](https://advancebiofuel.in/biodiesel-production-plant/)are at the forefront of this energy revolution. These facilities are designed to convert raw materials into high-quality biodiesel efficiently. The establishment of these plants is a testament to India’s commitment to sustainable energy and environmental protection. - Technological Advancements: Modern biodiesel plants incorporate advanced technologies to maximize efficiency and reduce production costs. Innovations such as automated processing systems and state-of-the-art purification techniques ensure the production of high-grade biodiesel. - Sustainable Feedstock Sources: Indian biodiesel plants are increasingly focusing on using non-food feedstocks, such as waste cooking oils and algae, to minimize competition with food resources. This approach not only enhances the sustainability of biodiesel production but also helps in waste management. - Government Support and Policies: The Indian government has introduced several policies and incentives to promote the growth of the biodiesel sector. These include subsidies for biodiesel production, tax exemptions, and initiatives to support research and development. Such measures are crucial for encouraging investment and scaling up production. - Local Impact: In cities like Ahmedabad, biodiesel plants are making a tangible difference. They contribute to local air quality improvements and provide a cleaner alternative to traditional diesel. Additionally, they support local economies by sourcing feedstocks from nearby farmers and creating job opportunities. Challenges and Future Outlook While the growth of biodiesel plants in India is promising, several challenges remain. These include: - Feedstock Supply: Ensuring a consistent and sustainable supply of feedstocks is crucial for the long-term viability of biodiesel production. Investments in agricultural practices and waste collection systems are needed to address this challenge. - Cost Competitiveness: Although biodiesel has environmental advantages, it is often more expensive than fossil fuels. Continued technological advancements and economies of scale are essential to make biodiesel more cost-competitive. - Infrastructure Development: The expansion of biodiesel production requires robust infrastructure for distribution and blending with conventional fuels. Investment in infrastructure development is necessary to support the growth of the biodiesel sector. Despite these challenges, the future of biodiesel in India looks bright. As technology advances and production scales up, biodiesel has the potential to become a cornerstone of India’s energy strategy. The sector’s growth is not only beneficial for the environment but also for the country’s economy and energy security. Conclusion Biodiesel plants are not just a trend but a transformative force in India’s energy landscape. They represent a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy future. By harnessing the power of renewable resources, these plants are reducing the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating economic opportunities. As India continues to navigate its path towards sustainable development, the role of biodiesel will become increasingly significant. The ongoing advancements in technology, coupled with supportive policies and local initiatives, will drive the sector forward and ensure its long-term success.

    "title": "North Korea's Kim preparing for war with US, steps up nuclear sector",
    "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered his nation's industrial and military sectors to prepare for war with the United States, citing \"unprecedented\" confrontational activity by the U.S. and its allies. Kim, speaking at a 2024 planning meeting Wednesday of his ruling Workers' Party, said an in-depth analysis indicated the \"severe political and military situation\" on the Korean peninsula had \"reached its limit,\" the state-run news agency reported Thursday. The news agency said the military-industrial sector, nuclear weapons sector and civil defense sector were urged to \"further accelerate the completion of preparations for this war.\"\nKim's statements continue a pattern of threatening rhetoric in recent months. They come less than two weeks after the White House \"reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to provide extended deterrence\" against Pyongyang and dismissed no military options − including nuclear.\n\"Any nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime,\" the White House statement said, warning that any nuclear attack targeting South Korea would be \"met with a swift, overwhelming, and decisive response.\"\nLast month, North Korea put a military spy satellite into orbit after two previous failed attempts. The U.S. and its allies consider the satellite a breach of United Nations Security Council resolutions. On Wednesday, Kim pledged to expand cooperative relations with \"independent, anti-imperialist countries in preparation for the rapidly changing international political landscape.\"\nSouth Korea bracing for more provocations South Korea's spy agency said Thursday that Kim was likely to carry out military provocations ahead of major elections in South Korea and the United States in 2024. The National Intelligence Service cited North Korea's track record of staging provocations before general elections in South Korea. Kim also has recently reinstated key figures involved in high-profile provocations against Seoul, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported.\nSouth Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday ordered troops not to wait for orders to retaliate in the event of an attack, saying the military \"should smash the enemy's desire for provocations immediately,\" Yonhap reported.\nIs North Korea preparing for war? It's a 'real possibility' Harry Kazianis, senior director of National Security Affairs at the Center for the National Interest − a conservative, Washington-based public policy think tank − told USA TODAY he is concerned that war with North Korea could become a \"real possibility.\"\nPyongyang has been working on tactical nuclear weapons for years, and just testing them could spark a crisis with Washington and Seoul, Kazianis said. He added that North Korea could test an intercontinental ballistic missile by sending it thousands of miles into the Pacific Ocean to ensure its missiles can indeed reach the U.S.\nNorth Korea has bolstered ties with Russia Kim has strengthened ties with Russia in recent months, and he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, a Russian spaceport, in September. Putin has been scrambling to arm his war against Ukraine, and last month U.S. authorities said Pyongyang had shipped more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia.\nKim knows US is tied up with 2024 elections Kim believes he can make his provocations and \"never pay a price\" because China and Russia are fully in the North Korean camp due to tensions with Washington, Kazianis said.\n\"The Kim family also knows that in 2024 America will be looking inward toward its presidential election, giving them the room to cause chaos and feel no pain,\" he said.",

    "title": "工作交接了却等不来新岗位，员工遭\"变相辞退\"|辞退_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "转自：工人日报\n　　工人日报讯 （记者吴铎思 马安妮）交接了工作却迟迟等不来新岗位，遭遇职场“冷暴力”的成都某公司（以下简称公司）员工王某被迫与公司对簿公堂，公司却以“旷工并与其他公司建立劳动关系为由”拒绝赔偿。近日，新疆维吾尔自治区昌吉回族自治州中级人民法院终审判决，公司向王某支付违法解除劳动合同赔偿金10万余元。\n　　王某于2021年12月入职公司，但干了不到两年，2023年10月16日，公司便通知王某交接工作。其间，法务组长通过系统告知王某先交接工作，若想调岗可联系。王某表示“可以先交接工作，调岗就算了”。此后，公司一直未给王某安排新岗位。\n　　王某认为自己事实上被公司违法解除劳动合同了。同年11月2日，王某向吉木萨尔县劳动人事争议仲裁委员会申请仲裁，要求公司支付违法解除劳动合同赔偿金10万余元。此后，王某未再去单位上班。\n　　2023年11月10日，公司对王某发出期限到岗通知书，告知其返回工作岗位或办理离职手续，但被王某拒绝。同年11月16日，公司就王某擅自离岗超过10天召开第一届职工代表大会第二次会议并形成纪要，表明解除与王某的劳动关系。公司认为，其间公司两次指派专人与其联系调解，均没有结果，最后按照公司相关规定与其解除劳动关系，过程合理合法。\n　　2024年1月，吉木萨尔县仲裁委作出仲裁裁决，要求公司支付王某违法解除劳动合同赔偿金10万余元。公司不服仲裁结果，诉至吉木萨尔县人民法院。\n　　该案争议焦点在于，公司是否存在违法解除劳动关系的情形？\n　　一审法院认为，直到王某申请仲裁时，公司亦未向王某安排新工作，更没有谈及要求交接工作的明确理由，既没有进行针对性的培训，也没有对其进行调岗。虽然公司并未以书面形式解除与王某的劳动关系，但其要求王某交接工作的行为已认定该公司事实上解除了与王某的劳动关系，其主张王某因连续旷工违反公司规章制度的理由不能成立。公司解除与王某劳动合同关系违法，判决公司支付王某违法解除劳动合同赔偿金10万余元。\n　　公司不服，上诉至昌吉回族自治州中级人民法院。二审法院驳回上诉，维持原判。\n　　上海兰迪（乌鲁木齐）律师事务所律师王慧霞建议，劳动者遇到“变相辞退”别慌，要留足证据，依法维权。“若原岗位被撤销，公司应先提供培训或协商新岗位，而非直接停岗。在本案中，公司长期不安排工作，属于变相不提供劳动条件，违法逼迫员工离职，须承担违法解除劳动合同责任。”王慧霞说。",
