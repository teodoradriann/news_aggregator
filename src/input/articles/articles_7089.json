    "title": "Hedy Lamarr Helped Develop the Technology Behind Wi-Fi – All the Way Back in World War II",
    "text": "Hedy Lamarr is often celebrated for her captivating performances on the silver screen during Hollywood’s illustrious Golden Age, but behind her luminous facade was a brilliant mind that contributed to the advancement of technology. In this realm, she was best known for her role in the invention of frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology, and her work has left a lasting impact on the way we communicate today.\nHedy Lamarr’s acting career\nBorn in Vienna, Austria-Hungary in November 1914 as Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, Heddy Lamarr captivated audiences in Europe before making the move to Hollywood. Starting out in the industry as a script girl, she began securing minor roles and\nultimately caught the attention of famed producer Max Reinhardt, who brought her back to Berlin, Germany with him.\nLamarr never wound up working with Reinhardt and, instead, teamed up with Russian theater producer Alexis Granowsky, who cast her in The Trunks of Mr. O.F. (1931). Two years later, the budding actor appeared in Ecstasy (1933),\nwhich launched her onto the international stage. Despite her success, the film’s production and release led to her taking a break from the industry in the years that followed, as she’d become disillusioned with the process.\nLamarr’s entry into Hollywood came\nfollowing a meeting with Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM, in 1937. She went on to appear alongside some of the Golden Age‘s biggest stars, including Clark Gable, James Stewart, Lana Turner, Judy Garland and Robert Taylor. She continued to act after leaving MGM in 1945 and even went on to form a production company with Jack Chertok.\nFrom actor to inventor\nHowever, Hedy Lamarr wasn’t just a pretty face; she possessed a curious and inventive mind. Her interest in applied science and engineering was piqued during her tumultuous first marriage to arms manufacturer Friedrich Mandl – Austria’s “Merchant of Death” – who exposed her to military technology and weaponry, and she wound up\ndeveloping a host of inventions. She preferred to spend her time at the drawing board, as opposed to attending lavish Hollywood parties.\nUpon the outbreak of the\nSecond World War, Lamarr tried to join the National Inventors Council (NIC), but was told she’d better help the war effort by using her fame to sell war bonds. This led her to appear at several rallies, as well as USO events.\nHowever, Lamarr knew she could help people with her inventions. This, paired with discussions she’d overheard regarding the use of torpedos at sea, led her to\nteam up with composer George Antheil to develop a system that could prevent the enemy from jamming their guidance systems once deployed.\nIf successful, this would prove critical to Allied efforts in the\nAtlantic, where German U-boats frequently jammed the signals of torpedoes fired at them, thereby setting them off course.\nFrequency-hopping and spread spectrum technology\nConcerned about the implications of system jamming to the war effort, Heddy Lamar proposed a possible solution. Together with George Antheil, the actor developed a device that changed frequencies at irregular intervals between transmission and reception, known as “frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology.”\nThis aimed to make radio-guided torpedoes harder for enemies to detect or jam. Their concept was inspired by 1) the way two pianists can perform together in sync and 2) existing technology that allowed player pianos to play in sync through the use of piano rolls.\nAfter years of hard work, the pair patented their invention, receiving\nPatent No. 2,292,387 in August 1942.\nThe US Navy initially rejected Hedy Lamar’s invention\nDespite its potential, the US Navy initially rejected Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil’s invention when they presented it in 1942, with officials failing to see its practical wartime application. They claimed the device, described as being as small as a pocket watch, would be too large to fit within a torpedo. On top of this, they viewed Lamarr as “\nan alien with ties to a foreign adversarial power,” given she hadn’t yet received her American citizenship.\nAnother possible reason for the service’s rejection was Lamarr’s looks, with historian and biographer Richard Rhodes\nexplaining, “Hedy always felt that people didn’t appreciate her for her intelligence – that her beauty got in the way.”\nIt wasn’t until years later that the true value of Lamarr and Antheil’s invention was recognized, after the patent had expired. The technology eventually became a staple in military communications, before making its way into the civilian sector.\nDelayed recognition for Hedy Lamarr\nIt wasn’t until the 1960s that the US Navy revisited Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil’s invention, incorporating it into operations during the\nCuban Missile Crisis. By this time, however, companies had been independently exploring the concept, meaning it was being developed across multiple fronts.\nOver the years, the significance of Lamarr and Antheil’s invention only grew, forming the foundation of modern spread-spectrum communication used in civilian technology, such as cellphones, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Wi-Fi.\nMore from us:\nWilliam Hopper: The Actor Who Played Paul Drake on ‘Perry Mason’ Served in the Navy in WWII\nIn 2014, Lamarr was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, a long overdue recognition. Her and Antheil were also awarded the Pioneer Award by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 1997.",

    "title": "Wall Street: record after record, Tesla and Intel disappoint -January 25, 2024 at 10:08 pm | MarketScreener",
    "text": "And that's 5!\nWall Street continues to set new records, with the S&P500 (+0.53%) achieving a petit slam: 6th affiliated gain and a 5th record close... but no new intraday zenith.\nThe Dow Jones rallied +0.3% in the wake of IBM (+9.5%) and Walgreen (+3.3%), a rise held back by Boeing (-5.7%).\nSmall slam also for the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2% to 15,510), which also posted a 6th rise and an all-time closing record. As for the Nasdaq-100, the initial 0.6% gain was largely wiped out by Tesla (-12.2%), which fell back to its lowest level since May 2023, and also plummeted in the ranking of the world's largest capitalizations, and could even leave the top-ten (Tesla suddenly fell behind Eli Lilly and Broadcom (despite a decline of nearly -2%).\nElon Musk has warned that sales growth will slow this year despite price cuts that are squeezing margins.\nDan Ives, the star analyst at Wedbush Securities, nicknamed the 'pope of technos', lowered his target from $350 to $315 and expressed his dismay: \"We were treated to a long explanation of the text on Tesla's long-term vision and a conference call that sounded like complete nonsense\".\nPaypal also gave up -3.6% after the publication of its results, and in the after-hours, Intel was a big disappointment, dropping -7.7%: the chipmaker reported sales of between $12.2 and $13.2 billion, compared with an expected $14.50 billion.\nWorse still, Intel forecasts first-quarter earnings of just 13 cents per share, excluding non-recurring items, whereas analysts were expecting 33 cents per share (this will improve in subsequent quarters).\nVisa also saw its quarterly results come in at a disappointing -2.8%... household spending is not supporting the group's business that much.\nThe S&P500 and Nasdaq were supported - for once - not only by the SOXX (semiconductor ETF down -0.3% this evening), but also by the oil sector (+2.5% on average among the majors), followed by United Rentals +13%, American Airlines +10.3%, Comcast +3.4%, Netflix +3.1% and Alphabet +2.2%.\nWithin the SOXX, performances were mixed: Western Digital climbed +4%, Cisco +2%, AMD +1.1%... but tomorrow, Intel's fall is likely to weigh heavily.\nAfter this heavy disappointment, followed by that of ST-Micro, ASML's cautious forecasts for Q1 2024.... it's hard to understand to what extent A.I. is helping to boost the results of the leaders in 'high-performance' chips... but perhaps it's only benefiting producers of the 'top of the top' (5 to 7 micron components, handling millions of operations/second).\nAs for US figures, Wall Street was not disappointed (its 0.5% rise bears witness to this): GDP (gross domestic product) growth for the 4th quarter of 2023 came in +1.3% higher than expected, at +3.3% annualized, according to a very first estimate from the Commerce Department.\nGrowth in the world's leading economy eased from the roaring 4.9% seen in the third quarter, but should reach 2.5% in 2024, well above the 2% previously forecast.\nThe increase in the fourth quarter was mainly due to growth in consumer spending and exports. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased', says the Commerce Department.\nSurprise, too, on the new single-family home sales front: they rebounded by 8% in December 2023 compared with the previous month, to an annualized rate of 664,000 units, according to the Commerce Department, following a 9% drop in November.\nThe median home price was $413,200, and the average price came in at $487,300. The inventory of new homes for sale stands at 453,000, representing a reserve of around 8.2 months at the current rate of sales.\nFinally, weekly jobless claims were up by 25,000: the Labor Department announced 214,000 new claimants, while the number of people receiving regular benefits also rose by 27,000 to 1.1 million.000 to 1.833Mn in the week from January 8 to January 13.\nSurprisingly, these very robust figures (notably GDP) are not worrying the US fixed-income markets, with the 2034 T-Bond erasing -5.5Pts to 4.123%, and the 2-year -7Ps to 4.308%.\nCopyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.

    "title": "Consequence Demands an Apology from Kanye West | VladTV",
    "text": "Consequence expressed his discontent with Kanye West following Ye's most recent controversial diatribe, which included anti-Semitic remarks during a Las Vegas hotel speech promoting his upcoming joint album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures. Kanye's statements involved conflating Zionists with Jewish people and propagating anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds. In response to the backlash, Kanye acknowledged the controversy and the resulting pariah status in the industry, stating, \"This is what y’all been waiting for. Drake, this what you been waiting for. Jay-Z, this is what you been waiting for. Cam, this is what you been waiting for.\" Kanye later apologized for his past anti-Jewish remarks, expressing regret and committing to learning from the experience for greater sensitivity in the future. However, Consequence, a longtime collaborator, took to Instagram on December 28 to address his grievances with Kanye. In a post promoting Kanye's new footwear design, Yzy Pods, Consequence stated, \"I have always lent my love, support and expertise to YE since ConMan Productions circa 2002. So @kanyewest NEVER again say in public or to others in private that you are ALONE. That’s the biggest SLAP IN THE FACE you could give to your TEAM.\" Consequence continued, emphasizing the contributions of himself and others to Kanye's career: \"Guys like me, Don C, Monop, GL, Doe, IBN, Arrow and even Virgil (RIP) have given you big portions of our Adult lives so that we could all be 'The Bulls.' But we didn’t help you become Jordan so you could turn into Jerry Krause and start playing 3D Musical chairs wit da bros!!! You can be the one with the Money And even the Power But I will always need my RESPECT. If you can apologize to the Jewish community in Hebrew… Then maybe you should apologize to a few of your guys in English. Love you bro But This Is 192.\"",

    "text": "Era una hazaña que por décadas se pensó que sería imposible de lograr. Pero a finales 2023, Willis Gibson -un adolescente estadounidense de 13 años conocido en internet como \"Blue Scuti\"-, ganó el juego de la versión para Nintendo de Tetris, lanzado por primera vez en 1989.\nLos diseñadores de la primera versión de Tetris pensaron que nadie podría hacerlo.\nEl juego está diseñado para que no paremos de jugar. Las piezas caen cada vez más rápido hasta que el jugador se agobia.\nPara ganar el juego, hay que alcanzar puntuaciones tan altas que hacen que la memoria del juego se sobrecargue y se cuelgue.\nEl jugador gana porque la computadora simplemente no puede continuar.\nComo profesor de ciencia cognitiva, me interesa cómo las personas adquieren experiencia, particularmente en videojuegos, por lo que cuando Gibson realizó su vertiginosa hazaña, inmediatamente me llamó la atención.\nLa forma en que lo hizo nos dice mucho sobre cómo los límites del desempeño humano están cambiando en la era digital.\nAnteriormente, sólo la inteligencia artificial había logrado vencer a Tetris en su versión para Nintendo.\nAquel programa especialmente diseñado fue capaz de percibir, casi instantáneamente, los movimientos de Tetris y responder rápidamente con acciones.\nJugó sin cansarse, sin cometer ningún error, yendo mucho más allá de las limitaciones que puede presentar un humano.\nEn aquel momento, en 2021, la IA pudo mostrar niveles del juego que anteriormente no habían sido explorados por humanos.\nAl igual que la física en los límites de un agujero negro, Tetris comienza a cambiar en los niveles superiores.\nLa velocidad se duplica repentinamente en el nivel 29, un nivel que pocos humanos alcanzan y pocos sobreviven por mucho tiempo.\nGibson juega desde que tiene 11 años y ha participado en varios torneos.",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "In August, a group of self-described “old ladies” fished out a toilet bowl from a pond in Massachusetts, U.S., and have gained local fame since then. The group is named Old Ladies Against Underwater Garbage (OLAUG), and so far, they’ve cleaned up 18 ponds, removing everything from tires and beer bottles to the bright blue toilet. To join the group, you must be a woman, able to swim half a mile in under 30 minutes and more than 64 years old, Susan Bauer, 84, the founder of OLAUG, told Mongabay by phone. She says older people bring a different perspective. “It’s the age of gratitude where you’ve lost enough so you’re really grateful for what’s left, whether that’s a husband or a child or it’s that you used to hear whip-poor-wills and now you don’t, you used to see spotted turtles and now you don’t,” Susan adds. Susan started OLAUG with a few friends during the pandemic. Today, her group is 25 strong and she has a waiting list of women who want to collect trash with her. She says the success of her group is that it’s fun. “We wade out of the water better, kinder, happier, more empowered women. Our product is joy. And it’s a hell of a lot easier to scale up joy than it is to scale up sacrifice.” “It’s the Zen of trash picking,” she adds. OLAUG works with one kayaker for every two swimmers. The kayaks haul most of the trash the swimmers collect.…This article was originally published on Mongabay\nRead the full article on Mongabay",

No se sabrá quién empezó.\n[#4](c4#c-4) israel tiene a eeuu, uk y francia, como mínimo, a su disposición... así que no sé... pero, claro, a ver en qué desemboca eso.\nLo que me sigue pareciendo \"curioso\" (ni de coña...) es que nadie hable de cómo israel invade otras regiones... más comparaciones con la alemania nazi debería haber... pero, de occidente, sólo me espero mentiras, excusas, hipocrecía y apoyo al genocida.\nPues se les hace un rusia, se les bloquea de todos lados, sanciones, vetos , fuera del Swift...y enviamos al libanos armamento y miles de millones\nY aquí no pasa nada, la amenaza si fuese de cualquier otro país que no esté en la órbita de EEUU la respuesta seria contundente, pero con Israel la cosa es diferente, pueden esquilmar, masacrar y hacer desaparecer a miles de habitantes, que aquí no pasa nada. Todo muy justo para la población asesinada y sus familias, claro, todos eran terroristas.\n[#36](c36#c-36) según la torá, la creación tiene 5761 años, lo que no es mucho para estar donde estamos si pensamos que la edad de piedra duró casi 3 millones de años. Por otro lado, los primeros pobladores de la tierra según las escrituras, tras Adán y Eva fueron Caín y Abel, que eran Agricultor y Ganadero. La agricultura no se desarrolló hasta hace 12.000 años, y ya es mucho más avanzado que lo que entendemos por edad de piedra.\n[#12](c12#c-12) El la serie Friends el personaje Ross era un judío paleontólogo. Su religión le dice que la tierra la creó su dios hace unos 5.000 años pero trabaja con huesos de 60 millones de años.\nNo hay por donde cogerlos.\n[#7](c7#c-7) No pueden llevarse bien con los vecinos porque tienen una novela delirante en la que un personaje imaginario les dijo que toda esa tierra es suya, como si fuera un notario.\nY en ello están, robando todo como quijotes pero con sangre de verdad.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No creo sean capaz, aunque están muy crecidos. Ahora si lo hacen, al igual que las otras veces es con las lametadas (que no permiso) de EEUU.\nAsí que a la edad de piedra, pues es un avance, ya que Netanyahu parece que se quedó en una edad pre-neandertal.",

    "text": "La solución para los entusiastas nostálgicos del robusto Hummer EV de GMC que añoran la icónica estética militar del H1, llega una innovadora solución. Presentamos el Cyber-Hummer, un H1 de primera generación personalizado y equipado con un sistema de propulsión Tesla, capaz de generar impresionantes 1000 caballos de fuerza y 1000 libras-pie de torque en su versión más potente. Según lo que informa GM Authority, este modelo de alto rendimiento es producido por North American EV (NAEV), una compañía canadiense dedicada a la fabricación de vehículos eléctricos, y ya está disponible para la venta.

El Cyber-Hummer, en su modelo de gama alta, cuenta con un sistema de tracción total impulsado por dos motores, y logra una potencia de cuatro dígitos. Es decir, puede acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en tan solo 2,5 segundos y ofrece una autonomía de 480 km con una sola carga. Para propulsar esta obra de ingeniería, NAEV también ofrece configuraciones de 600 y 300 caballos de fuerza, que permiten alcanzar los 100 km/h en 3,5 y 5,0 segundos respectivamente, manteniendo la misma autonomía de 480 km por carga. Además, este H1 eléctrico es compatible con los sistemas de carga NACS y CCS. Diseño y características Cyber-Hummer H1. Fuente: GM Authority. Uno de los aspectos más destacados del Cyber-Hummer es su peso en vacío significativamente reducido. Con un peso estimado de 4500 libras, es prácticamente la mitad de pesado que el GMC Hummer EV de 9000 libras, lo que se traduce en un rendimiento superior. Este vehículo está equipado con llantas de 20 pulgadas y una distancia al suelo de 15 pulgadas, lo que lo hace ideal para aventuras todoterreno. En su interior, ofrece asientos cómodos para seis adultos, con una configuración de tres asientos tanto en la fila delantera como en la trasera. Precios del Cyber-Hummer Cyber-Hummer H1.

La compañía ha lanzado una herramienta de configuración en su sitio web, permitiendo a los clientes personalizar su vehículo y elegir entre cuatro colores exteriores. Los interesados pueden reservar su Cyber-Hummer con un depósito reembolsable de US$ 300. El tiempo estimado de producción es de aproximadamente seis meses a partir del pedido inicial, y NAEV planea producir más de 300 unidades al año. ¿Que opinas sobre este &quot;renacimiento del popular vehículo militar?",
