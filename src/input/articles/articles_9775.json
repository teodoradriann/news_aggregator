    "text": "Fall time means cranberry time!\nAnd you can escape to the Hartley Family Farm in Rochester for a “berry” good time.\n“They are one of the very few fruits that actually grew only here. This is their native soil right here in the Cape Cod area,” said owner Woody Hartley.\n“If you’re going to go to Paris, aren’t you going to go see the Eiffel Tower??? Well, if you’re coming to Massachusetts, come see a cranberry bog! It’s the same thing,” he continued.\nWoody and Sharon Hartley let you tour their cranberry bog.\n“It’s kind of crazy,” said visitor Keira Harkins.\n“Real exciting,” said Paula Meere.\nClimb on board, and let this tractor pull you beside the bogs.\n“First stop, we’re gonna talk about is the history of cranberries in Massachusetts,” Woody said while giving a group a ride. “Cranberries were growing wild and they were found there by the pilgrims.”\nEver wondered how these blushing berries got their colorful name?\n“They called it a ‘crane berry’ and somewhere along the line, maybe dad had too much to drink, and he said, ‘Pass me the cranberries!’ And from then on, it was called cranberries,” Woody said.\nOr how many berries a big bog can produce?\n“We’ll get between 15- and 18-hundred barrels right now,” Woody said. “I feel it’s always a good crop if we fill up one truck on every bog.”\nBut don’t get bogged down by the numbers. Remember to soak in the incredible view!\n“90 percent of the cranberries are picked in the water,” Woody said.\n“Anybody wants to go in, go ahead,” he said. “Here’s your chance to get in there, take a look at the cranberries yourself, get a good look at them, see what it’s like.”\nTime to clip in and wade in!\nThese berries look good enough to eat.\n“I would advise against it, because this is a natural setting,” Woody said. “Take them home and wash them, first thing you do. Wash the cranberries, then you can eat all you want.”\nIt’s a memorable experience that only happens once a year.\n“It’s fun, it’s fascinating. Let’s face it — it is a beautiful sight to see. It really is,” Woody said.\nIf you’d like to wade into the water, cranberry bog tours begin this weekend. There are limited dates available. For more information head over to cranberrybogtour.com .",

    "title": "President Museveni launches Uganda's first Islamic bank - The Standard",
    "text": "Demand for Islamic banking is fast rising in East Africa buoyed by the increase in the region's Muslim population. But Islamic banking is not only for Muslims alone but also for non-Muslims eager to take advantage of interest-free banking services. Also noteworthy is the fact that the growth of this banking category exhibits good tidings yet Islamic banking providers in the region are scarce, estimated at less than 10 per cent of commercial banks. On the global scene, estimates by various analyses including the World Bank show that global Islamic finance assets could reach $3.8 trillion by 2024. Recent studies have also shown that the quality of services available in fully fledged Islamic banks and in banks that only offer Islamic banking windows are almost at par, hence the steep growth. Some of East Africa’s established Islamic banks include First Community Bank Limited, Gulf African Bank, Sharjah Islamic Bank. National Bank, PBZ, Amana, KCB, NBC and Stanbic have opened Islamic bank windows. The latest provider to make new forays is Salaam Bank which was launched in Uganda on Wednesday, becoming the country first ever Islamic Bank. As Uganda launched its first, Kenya issued the first Islamic Bond to finance affordable housing agenda, revealing untapped demand. Islamic banking is based on Islamic principles where it is not allowed to pay and receive interest but rather it is based on profit sharing. Islamic banks focus on generating returns on investments through investment tools that are “Sharia” compliant. President Yoweri Museveni launched Salaam bank during Ramadhan dua prayers, saying Uganda does not discriminate banks or any other commercial enterprises on account of religion. “I welcome Salaam Bank to Uganda. This is a big market with a population of 48 million now and in the next 27 years, the population of Uganda will be 106 million. You are going to start right away to serve the people,” he said. Djibouti’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said Salaam Group was keen on broadening the scope of its activities in Africa, including Uganda which he said has a safe and solid financial institution. Board Chairman of Salaam Bank Ibrahim Abdirahman said President Museveni had signed the Islamic bank regulations into law at a time when the Islamic community really needed it. “This licence for Salaam Bank was handed over to us on September 8, 2023. We thank you for supporting us wholeheartedly. The establishment of an Islamic Bank marks a significant milestone in Uganda’s journey towards economic empowerment and inclusive financial growth,” he said. Abdirahman added: “Islamic finance offers among others, Sharia compiled bonds from which the government can raise capital for various infrastructure and projects. We are hopeful that the government of Uganda will embrace this opportunity because of its immense benefits.” In September last year, the Bank of Uganda granted its first Islamic banking license to Salaam Bank Uganda Ltd, a subsidiary of a Djibouti-based bank after Parliament passed legislation to authorize Islamic banking, which President Museveni signed into law in August 2023. According to the PEW Research Centre, the Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to grow by nearly 60 per cent from 242.5 million in 2010 to 385.9 million in 2030. This only means Islamic banking sector is destined for further growth despite regional financial shocks. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter",

    "text": "Phoenix Suns rookie Ryan Dunn has been a bright spot for an underperforming team this season.\nA lot of the criticism around the Phoenix Suns this season has been warranted. They did not expect to be sitting in 11th place in the Western Conference at this stage of the season.\nUdonis Haslem called the Suns out for not adding enough talented players around Kevin Durant , Devin Booker and Bradley Beal.\nBut arguably one move the Suns did get right, was picking up Ryan Dunn in the 2024 NBA Draft.\nDunn scored 17 points in the recent win over the Raptors, just short of his career high of 18 set in January.\nMonday 18th March Phoenix Suns Phoenix Suns 129 | 89 Toronto Raptors Toronto Raptors Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images Playing alongside Kevin Durant Ryan Dunn has been speaking about the early stages of his NBA career, and the dream experience of getting to play alongside two-time champion Kevin Durant .\nSpeaking to the Run Your Race podcast, Dunn admitted: “KD’s my favorite player.”\nAsked about what it is like playing with and practicing with Durant, Dunn says his approach is trying to soak up as much information as possible.\nDunn said: “He doesn’t really miss, every rep is the same, I think he does so well, and I’m learning, I’m grateful to have him, Devin and Brad, I’m learning, I’m seeing how he is in the game. I’m observing, and I need to ask more questions but I really like to watch, and see how they really work.\n“They really imagine themselves picking spots, where to go.\n“Seeing him at work every day, you understand why he’s Kevin Durant. You see it, he’s not picking up any nonsense, he’s serious when it comes to his work.”\nDunn says Durant got him involved in practice and shootaround straight away, and helped to build his confidence to make the step up. But he says most of all, he still likes to watch and learn.\nHe added: “Watching him that’s great, I always watched him growing up, it’s surreal to have him as a teammate.”\nDurant has set such high standards in his career that he gets criticism if his teams are not winning games, that comes with the territory of being a superstar. But the reverence his young teammate holds in him is a reminder of what he has achieved, and the respect he is held in by his peers.\nDunn added that there was crucial advice he received from Durant: “During training camp, we’re going, me and him. There were times where I would pass up on a shot and KD would be like ‘what the ___ are you doing, shoot the ball. I need you to shoot that.’”\nRyan Dunn says he expected to be drafted to one of three teams Ryan Dunn also reflected on his NBA Draft experience, which ultimately saw him drafted to the Phoenix Suns. He was taken 28th by the Denver Nuggets , who traded him to his eventual destination.\nDunn said there were three teams he had heard might be keen, the Celtics, Suns and Knicks, with his biggest focus being on the latter.\nHe said: “I had a feeling. My three were Boston, Phoenix and New York. I’m a New York kid. I’m hearing all this stuff.\n“Phoenix didn’t come in until later in the process, the last couple of days.”\nHe said he was ‘stressed’ when the Knicks passed on him and took Pacome Dadiet at 26 instead, before his eventual path took him to the Phoenix Suns.",

    "text": "Key Takeaways - The S&P 500 gained 0.7% on Thursday, April 11, 2024, after a report showed wholesale prices rose less than expected in March. - Apple shares jumped following a report it plans to overhaul its Mac computers with newer versions of its in-house processors with AI features. - Shares of insurer Globe Life plunged after Fuzzy Panda disclosed a short position in the stock and cited allegations of fraud. Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed as investors received some refreshing news on inflation, with the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) report revealing that wholesale prices rose less than expected in March. The S&P 500 pushed 0.7% higher, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.7%, boosted by outperformance from the technology sector. After spending most of the afternoon in positive territory, the Dow was little changed. Paramount Global ( PARA ) shares notched the top performance on the S&P 500, popping 7.3% higher amid reports of progress on a potential merger with Skydance Media with Skydance set to meet with Paramount management next week. The possible deal has sparked controversy and was criticized earlier this week by Paramount shareholder Matrix Asset Advisors. Four board members are expected to step down amid concerns about the merger. In a day of strong gains for tech companies, shares of Broadcom ( AVGO ) jumped 4.5%. JPMorgan analysts reportedly said earlier in the week that Broadcom could benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) , with growing investment in the data centers that underpin AI serving as a catalyst. The wave of enthusiasm around AI helped lift other semiconductor stocks. Micron Technology ( MU ) shares added 4.3%. Shares of Nvidia ( NVDA ) climbed 4.1%, rebounding from a correction that saw the stock briefly dip 10% below its all-time closing high. Apple ( AAPL ) shares added 4.3% following a report it plans to overhaul its Mac computers with updated versions of its in-house processors with AI features. Analysts also pointed to the tech giant's potential to benefit from AI . Shares of insurer Globe Life ( GL ) plummeted 53.1%, logging the steepest losses on the S&P 500 after short seller Fuzzy Panda disclosed that it had taken a short position in the stock. Fuzzy Panda said it had discovered multiple allegations of insurance fraud committed by Globe Life and its subsidiaries. Carmax ( KMX ) shares plunged 9.2% after the used car retailer reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales and profits . High rates on car loans and a limited supply of used vehicles weighed on the company's performance. Fastenal ( FAST ), which supplies screws and other fasteners for construction and manufacturing markets, also fell short of quarterly estimates , and its shares sank 6.5%. Sales of fasteners dropped 4.4% year over year. The company said bad weather and complexities involving the quarterly calendar had a negative impact on the results.

    "text": "EUGENE, Ore. — A Junction City man with two prior child pornography convictions was sentenced to federal prison Wednesday for repeatedly possessing and distributing child pornography online.\nChristopher Lyn Sparks, 59, was sentenced to 210 months in federal prison and a lifetime term of supervised release, the U.S. Attorney's Office - District of Oregon reported.\nAccording to court documents, in 2006 and 2013, Sparks was convicted of federal child pornography charges and violating the terms of his supervised release. In November 2023, following his second release from prison, Sparks was required to serve a lifetime term of supervised release.\nIn May 2024, officers with the Portland Police Bureau alerted Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents to a series of CyberTipline reports related to child sex abuse material from several online social media and messaging platforms including Google, X (formerly Twitter), Tumblr, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Telegram, and TikTok.\nInvestigators traced multiple accounts from those CyberTips to Sparks and learned he had resumed distributing child sexual abuse material online through these platforms while still under federal supervision. An HSI agent, posing as a person interested in these materials, contacted Sparks through his Telegram account. Sparks exchanged messages with the agent and discussed sexually exploiting children. The agent discovered that Sparks was openly offering to trade and advertising child pornography using his Telegram account. On June 11, 2024, Sparks was arrested after agents executed a federal search warrant and seized his phone, which contained child pornography.\nOn July 9, 2024, Sparks was charged by criminal information with possessing and distributing child pornography. On December 11, 2024, he pleaded guilty to both charges.\nThis case was investigated by HSI with assistance from the FBI and the Portland Police Bureau. It was prosecuted by William M. McLaren, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.\nMore information from the U.S. Attorney's Office - District of Oregon:\nAnyone who has information about the physical or online exploitation of children are encouraged to contact HSI at (866) 347-2423 or submit a tip online at report.cybertip.org.\nFederal law defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor. It is important to remember child sexual abuse material depicts actual crimes being committed against children. Not only do these images and videos document the victims’ exploitation and abuse, but when shared across the internet, re-victimize and re-traumatize the child victims each time their abuse is viewed. To learn more, please visit the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children at www.missingkids.org.\nThis case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse.
