    "title": "Boeing workers overwhelmingly reject contract, prepare to strike",
    "text": "More than 30,000 Boeing workers, members of the company’s biggest unionized group, were set to strike Friday after staff rejected a new labor contract and approved a strike with a 96% vote. The work stoppage will halt production of most of the company’s aircraft, including its best-selling 737 Max. The strike is another costly blow to the company trying to increase output and improve its reputation. More than 30,000 Boeing workers were set to strike Friday, halting production of most of the company’s aircraft after staff overwhelmingly rejected a new labor contract.\nIt’s a costly development for the manufacturer that has struggled to ramp up production and restore its reputation following safety crises.\nWorkers in the Seattle area and in Oregon voted 94.6% against a tentative agreement that Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers unveiled Sunday. They voted 96% to strike, far more than the two-thirds vote required for a work stoppage.\n“We strike at midnight,” said IAM District 751 President Jon Holden at a press conference where he announced the vote’s results. He characterized it as an “unfair labor practice strike,” alleging that factory workers had experienced “discriminatory conduct, coercive questioning, unlawful surveillance and we had unlawful promise of benefits.”\nHe said Boeing needs to bargain in good faith.\nBoeing didn’t immediately comment.\nM. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty Images A worker walks outside the Boeing Co. manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington, US, on Thursday, Sept. 12, 2024. The tentative proposal included 25% wage increases and other improvements to health-care and retirement benefits, though the union had sought raises of about 40%. Workers had complained about the agreement, saying that it didn’t cover the increased cost of living.\nThe vote is a blow to CEO Kelly Ortberg , who has been in the top job for five weeks. A day before the vote, he had urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company’s recovery.\nThe ultimate financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts.\nJefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimated a 30-day cash impact from a strike could be a $1.5 billion hit for Boeing and said it “could destabilize suppliers and supply chains.” She forecast the tentative agreement would have had an annual impact of $900 million if passed.\nBoeing has burned through about $8 billion so far this year and has mounting debt. Production has fallen short of expectations as the company works to stamp out manufacturing flaws and faces other industry-wide problems such as supply and labor shortages.\nA blowout of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 at the start of the year has brought additional federal scrutiny of Boeing’s production lines.\nHow fixing airplane engines became a $58 billion business Low-cost airlines are turning away airplanes to cut costs Southwest shakes up board, chairman to step down next year amid activist pressure",

    "title": "Best Modpacks For Minecraft",
    "text": "- Tekxit offers a unique fusion of Tekkit and Hexxit, providing challenging dungeons and exploration in one modpack. - Hexxit shakes up the formula by introducing mystical elements, dungeons, and towers for players to conquer. - All The Mods series boasts over 400 mods, providing a progression tree and rewards for mastering each mod. Minecraft has a rich modding community that has created iconic modpacks over the years. These packs collate the very best the community has to offer and compiles them into a unique gameplay experience that elevates the vanilla title and introduces many new gameplay aspects. Related 15 Beginner Tips For The RLCraft Minecraft Modpack RLCraft is infamous for being among the most difficult Minecraft mods. Here’s how complete beginners can get started on their survival journey. Some modpacks introduce electricity, rockets, space travel, portals, and more. There’s no shortage of modpacks that can cater to every gamer’s whim. There are, however, so many that it’s hard to not be paralyzed by indecision! If players are looking to embark on an epic adventure filled with interesting stories or build a space station with friends, there’s a modpack for them. But, which ones are the best? Tekxit The Combination Of Science And Sorcery Tekxit is a fusion modpack that combines two classic Minecraft modpacks into one unforgettable experience. This modpack currently plays on Minecraft 1.12.2 and allows players to craft their factories just like in Tekkit, while maintaining the iconic dungeoneering and exploration that makes Hexxit such a great pack. The Dungeon Tactics mod adds sprawling dungeons that provide a nice challenge for players to overcome, which are randomly generated for a new challenge each time and add countless new weapons and mysteries for players to explore. In total, 104 mods are combined to create this pack, including BiblioCraft, Buildcraft, ComputerCraft, Tinker’s Construct, and more. This pack is great for any player who wants to embrace a more “campaign-style” Minecraft modpack, without sacrificing so many creature comforts typically accompanied by Tekkit. Hexxit The Mystical Modpack Hexxit was a modpack that shook up the formula at the time of release, with the vast majority of modpacks focusing more on the technological side of things, rather than the mystical. Hexxit introduced some story elements to modpacks too, which was also a unique twist on what had come to be a tried and true formula. Related Best Minecraft Mods That Add New Bosses Minecraft has a dire need for new bosses. Luckily, these incredible mods add challenging and interesting bosses to spice the game up. Hexxit is truly more than the sum of its parts. The pack collates 55 mods that bring dungeons and towers for players to conquer, or become masters of their own world in a fusion modpack that combines the best of Minecraft with a Dungeons and Dragons-style campaign. Pixelmon Reforged Fusing Pokemon & Minecraft The Pixelmon modpack, and the countless spin-off modpacks it has spawned, have all been incredibly successful, and it’s hard to be surprised when combining two of the most popular franchises in the world, as Pokemon and Minecraft crossover and become one, allowing players to live out their dreams of playing with their favorite Pokemon in a sandbox environment. Arguably the most requested Pokemon game has been a sandbox RPG-esque title set in the Pokemon universe that allows players to forge their own story with Pokemon by their side, but sadly, this want has largely fallen on deaf ears. With this mod, and subsequent modpacks, players took matters into their own hands and fused the two iconic games to allow many players to rediscover their love for Pokemon in a title that lends itself extremely well to the sandbox feel so many fans had been craving. Tekkit The Reworked Version Of The Classic Modpack Tekkit was one of the most iconic modpacks available ever and largely remains so. After the horrendously unbalanced Tekkit Classic, a new version of Tekkit was created that compiled over 60 mods to create an experience that captured the essence of the classic pack, while introducing new gameplay elements that still stayed true to the feel of the original. Most notably, Tekkit did away with Equivalent Exchange 2 to prevent infinite item generation, and instead introduced Galacticraft, Dimensional Doors, and focused on Buildcraft more than IndustrialCraft 2. This modpack is credited with bringing Galacticraft into the mainstream, which has been included in many modpacks and has inspired mods like Ad Astra, which use similar concepts but build upon the original idea. Tekkit has a special place in the hearts of many fans and was a mainstay in the modding community for several years. All The Mods Quite Literally, All The Mods The All The Mods series is the pinnacle of Minecraft modpacks, with the latest iteration of the modpack boasting over 400 unique mods that provide both an extremely fun experience and a bit of progression for players to seek their teeth into. This modpack combines Ad Astra, Jetpacks, seamless structure copy and pasting, countless quality-of-life improvements, new Ender Chests, Immersive Engineering, and more. What’s so special about this modpack is it provides something of a progression tree, compelling players to play each mod to their endgame, rewarding players along the way with countless rewards and unique items that can be gained after mastering each mod, which can ultimately be combined into the “All The Mods Star” which signifies total completion of the modpack. This provides excellent utility for players to build to their heart’s content, and get something to show for their hours of progress. The 1.7.10 Pack/The 1.12.2 Pack The “Perfectly Complex” Series The 1.7.10 Pack, and sequel modpack The 1.12.2 Pack became some of the most popular modpacks upon release, replacing Tekkit as the “go-to” modpack for many. Both modpacks use the tagline “Perfectly Complex” and serve as a spiritual successor to the Tekkit modpack, expanding the mod list to over 200 unique mods that reshaped the gameplay experience. Similar to Tekkit, these modpacks utilized Galacticraft and Buildcraft as the core “industrial” aspects and introduced new twists on the gameplay by introducing extra planets for Galacticraft, and new mods like Thaumcraft, Tinker’s Construct, and The Twilight Forest. These modpacks served as a spiritual successor to the Tekkit series, which largely remained stagnant after the release of the reworked Tekkit, updating to later versions of Minecraft and giving players new challenges and opportunities. It kept a largely similar feel to Tekkit, while ensuring the new, additional mods didn’t break the balance of the game and allowed players to experiment to their heart’s content. Tekkit Classic The Modpack That Kickstarted A Craze Tekkit Classic was one of the earliest modpacks that made a huge impact on the Minecraft scene, as YouTubers and gamers everywhere were downloading Tekkit to explore their wildest fantasies in a seemingly boundless Minecraft enhanced by magic and technology. While it’s difficult to claim this pack is in any way balanced, the sheer nostalgia of this pack and the path that it paved is incomparable. Related Minecraft: Mods That Make Your Game Scarier Who says Minecraft can’t be a horror game? With these mods, this otherwise laid-back title becomes downright terrifying. It features a plethora of different mods that were entirely new concepts to most of the Minecraft community, like Equivalent Exchange 2, BuildCraft, and Industrial Craft 2. Players could utilize the magic of equivalent exchange to break items down into their EMC value and use that to conjure new items or create nuclear reactors to power their base. It’s unquestionable that Tekkit Classic kicked off an entire sub-genre of Minecraft and paved the way for a dedicated community to flourish, even years after the game was released.

    "text": "Heavy rains lashing the Western Cape have sent dam levels soaring, with the latest figures showing that six of the province’s major dams are now above 80% of capacity , bringing welcome relief as winter storms continue to sweep the region.\nAccording to official data released by the City of Cape Town on Wednesday, 9 July , the combined storage of the six key dams now stands at 80.9% , a sharp increase from 73.6% just a week ago – and well above the 70.6% recorded during the same period last year.\nThe dams showing notable increases include:\nTheewaterskloof Dam : Now at 76.8% capacity – the largest dam in the province, responsible for over 50% of total water storage Voëlvlei Dam : At 75% capacity Berg River, Steenbras Lower, Steenberg Upper, and Wemmershoek Dams : All reporting gains and contributing to the strong collective total More rain on the way Meteorological forecasts predict additional cold fronts arriving in the coming days, which could further boost water reserves as the Western Cape continues to benefit from sustained winter rainfall.\nDay Zero a distant memory – for now The province’s water security has significantly improved since the 2017-2018 ‘Day Zero’ crisis , when dam levels plummeted and emergency water rationing loomed large.\nAt that time, Theewaterskloof dipped below 20% capacity, sparking fears of Cape Town becoming the first major city to run dry.\nAuthorities are urging residents to continue using water responsibly, despite the positive figures, reminding the public that climate unpredictability and long-term demand pressures still pose risks.\nWESTERN CAPE DAM LEVELS Do you still practice water-saving at your home?

    "text": "México, Chiapas 2 mil 300 personas han sido desplazadas forzosamente de comunidades en la frontera chiapaneca: Frayba comunicacion@educaoaxaca.org [educaoaxaca.org](https://www.educaoaxaca.org/) A través de una acción urgente, el Centro de Derechos Humanos Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (FRAYBA) , hizo un llamado a todos los niveles de gobierno a atender urgentemente la actual crisis de desplazamiento en la región Frontera- sierra de Chiapas que ya contabiliza a 2 mil 300 personas que han sido desplazadas forzadamente de más de 30 comunidades. “En las primeras semanas del mes de enero del 2024 la violencia se ha agudizado en las regiones Frontera y Sierra de Chiapas; la documentación realizada apunta a una verdadera crisis humanitaria traducida en al menos 2,300 personas en situación de Desplazamiento Forzado originarias de los municipios de Chicomuselo, Socoltenango y La Concordia. Estos hechos se enmarcan en el contexto de violencia que emana de la disputa por el control del territorio entre la delincuencia organizada. El Desplazamiento Forzado es parte de las formas de acción que utilizan los grupos criminales para el control de la población” señala el Frayba. La diócesis de San Cristóbal también ha hecho un llamado urgente a las autoridades, pues aseguran que “hay comunidades que han quedado vacías” por la situación de violencia que se vive. Las personas desplazadas de estas 30 comunidades, “están refugiadas en cabeceras municipales de los municipios de Chicomuselo, Socoltenango, Tzimol, La Trinitaria, La Concordia y Comitán, algunas más han migrado hacia lugares como Playa del Carmen, en el estado de Campeche” aseveró el Frayba. Además recordaron que esta situación no es nueva, pues distintas organizaciones de la sociedad civil, habían denunciado con antelación que está situación se agudizaría, y señalaron que “Tan solo en el mes de junio del año 2021 a la fecha han sido víctimas de desplazamiento forzado más de 10,000 personas, que han huido de sus hogares para salvar sus vidas”. El Frayba también lamento que ante esta emergencia, las autoridades como Protección Civil del Estado de Chiapas manejen un discurso irresponsable al minimizar la situación del desplazamiento, llamando a las personas que han dejado sus hogares como “personas en situación de vulnerabilidad ante un evento socio-organizativo”. . fuente: [https://www.educaoaxaca.org/2-mil-300-personas-han-sido-desplazadas-forzosamente-de-comunidades-en-la-frontera-chiapaneca-frayba/](https://www.educaoaxaca.org/2-mil-300-personas-han-sido-desplazadas-forzosamente-de-comunidades-en-la-frontera-chiapaneca-frayba/) reenviado por enred_sinfronteras@riseup.net [https://twitter.com/RedLatinaSinFro/](https://twitter.com/RedLatinaSinFro/) [https://mastodon.bida.im/@RedLatinasinfronteras](https://mastodon.bida.im/@RedLatinasinfronteras)",
