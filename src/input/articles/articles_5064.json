    "title": "“Non fate l’elemosina ai mendicanti”. Il cartello che indigna i fedeli in una chiesa di Padova - La Stampa",
    "text": "C’è chi è rimasto a fissarlo e chi ha commentato, andandosene sconcertato. La questione riguarda un cartello affisso in una chiesa di Padova in cui si chiede di non aiutare chi è in difficoltà. Esattamente le parole riportate sono le seguenti: «I fedeli sono pregati di non dare l’elemosina ai mendicanti in chiesa e nemmeno nei dintorni».\nParole che stridono fortemente con il luogo in cui è stato appeso oltre che il periodo natalazio, in cui tutti si dovrebbe, sottolineando “dovrebbe”, essere più buoni e predisposti verso gli altri. La chiesa in questione è quella dell’Adorazione eucaristica perpetua di via Santa Lucia, in centro a Padova. «Sono scandalizzato, e mi dispiace che sotto Natale non ci sia posto per i poveri in chiesa», ha commentato al Mattino di Padova don Albino Bizzotto, presidente dell’associazione Beati costruttori di pace.\nLa richiesta va contro i principi cristiani della solidarietà e dell’aiuto ai poveri. Ed è saltato all’occhio dei fedeli, provocandone l’indignazione. Ma l’Opera dell’Adorazione eucaristica perpetua sostiene con forza l’iniziativa: bandita non è l’elemosina, ha precisato, quanto la pratica dell’accattonaggio molesto. «La chiesa resta sempre aperta, 24 ore su 24. È per questo che noi abbiamo anche il compito di garantire il rispetto e il silenzio in tutti quei momenti di intimo raccoglimento dei fedeli», spiega una referente dell’opera religiosa al Mattino .\n«Essendo una chiesa sempre aperta e non una parrocchia, gli accattoni gravitano intorno al luogo di culto a tutte le ore e non solo durante le occasionali funzioni religiose, anche di notte. Questo ha portato problemi anche ai commercianti della zona che si sono lamentati per la presenza costante di gente che chiede l’elemosina”, ha concluso la referente. “Alcuni fedeli sono stati avvicinati in orari notturni da alcuni mendicanti molesti che in modo insistente hanno chiesto denaro, non solo disturbando i momenti di culto, ma diffondendo anche un certo senso di insicurezza».\nMa per don Albino Bizzotto non ci sono scuse. «I poveri meritano attenzione soprattutto in questi giorni. Certo, va individuato l’opportunismo, ma non agire in modo generalizzato precludendo ai bisognosi la carità».\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori Video del giorno Ultima Generazione, blitz alla Rinascente di Milano nell'ora dello shopping: \"Venite con noi a parlare del collasso climatico\"",

Non-evidence-based videos promoted Mucinex, supplements, progesterone, massages and avoiding caffeine and alcohol to improve conception. More than half of the top videos on TikTok about conception strategies without treatment were not backed by science, with most created by nonprofessionals and content creators for profit, according to a research letter.\n“Throughout the United States, reproductive health education has focused on contraception, with little education on fertility and how to become pregnant, resulting in low fertility awareness among people of reproductive age,” Hannah Jahnke, PhD, director of clinical research at Maven Clinic in New York, and colleagues wrote in O&G Open . “Consequently, many people who are trying to become pregnant turn to social media to learn about strategies to optimize chances of pregnancy.”\nLess than 50% of videos featured only evidence-based pregnancy strategies. Image: Adobe Stock. Jahnke and colleagues searched TikTok for the top 100 videos featuring strategies for conception without treatment that appeared using “#ttc,” which was the most used hashtag for trying to conceive on the app. The authors evaluated TikTok videos for creator professional qualifications, potential for profiting from content and scientific evidence base.\nOverall, the median number of video interactions was 14,000 likes, 237 comments, 1,756 saves and 588 shares. Most TikTok videos were created by those with no health care affiliation (62%), whereas 27% were made by traditional and 11% by complementary health care professionals. Of traditional health care professionals, 21% were OB/GYNs, 5% were nurses and 1% were urologists.\nOf the top TikTok videos on conception, 43% featured only evidence-based strategies, 35% featured only non-evidence-based strategies and 22% featured both evidence and non-evidence-based strategies. Videos created by traditional health care professionals were less likely to contain non-evidence-based information vs. videos created by those with no health care affiliation (18% vs. 75.8%; P < .001).\n“People who are trying to become pregnant may be particularly vulnerable to misinformation and videos with combinations of evidence-based and non-evidenced-based information may be particularly insidious, because the elements of truth make it more difficult to discern fact from fiction,” the researchers wrote.\nRegarding the potential for profiting from content, 18% of videos were produced by creators featuring links to products. Of those, 72.2% featured non-evidence-based information.\nCommon themes observed among non-evidence-based TikTok videos included taking Mucinex, dietary and probiotic supplements, using progesterone, practicing fertility massages and promoting complete avoidance of caffeine and alcohol to enhance the likelihood of conception.\nThe most common evidence-based strategies noted within TikTok videos were using ovulation tracking and timed intercourse, healthy eating and use of at-home insemination kits.\n“Although medical advice on social media currently is unregulated and often inaccurate, social media remains a central touchpoint for people seeking health information,” the researchers wrote. “Due to their popularity and accessibility, social media platforms have the potential to serve as tools to break down barriers to accessing information and promote medically accurate health education. Future work should aim to ensure that the general public has access to trustworthy information.”",

    "text": "Another one of the Disaster Recovery Centers set up in the wake of the Ruidoso wildfires and flooding over the summer is set to close on Tuesday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that it will close down a Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) located at the Angus Church of the Nazarene on Tuesday, Aug. 13, at 7 p.m. Similarly, a DRC that was operated by the State of New Mexico and FEMA at the Mescalero Library on the Mescalero Apache Reservation will cease operations under FEMA at 7 p.m. on Friday. Instead, it will transition to a Disaster Resource Center, located at the Mescalero Community Center, run by New Mexico’s Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management on Saturday. Disaster Case Managers will be on-site to assist residents with their recovery from the South Fork and Salt Fires and flooding from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Meanwhile, the DRC at the Horton Complex in Ruidoso is still providing help with the FEMA appeals process and applications, as well as hosting representatives from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), and state, local and nonprofit community organizations. That DRC is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and closed on Sunday. FEMA reminded residents that it's imperative they keep in contact with agency, and provide it with the most up-to-date information, especially if situations change. For example, FEMA said that if someone reported their home had no disaster-related damage but later discovered damage, they shouldcontact FEMA to update their application or submit an appeal if they were denied assistance. Likewise, those with low-interest SBA disaster loans should call the SBA Disaster Assistance Customer Service Centerto update information or check the status of an application at: 800-659-2955; by email at disastercustomerservice@SBA.gov or via the SBA [website](sba.gov/disaster). Hard of hearing or deaf individuals may call 7-1-1 to access telecommunications relay services.

    "text": "The Chadster is absolutely cheesed off right now! 😡😡😡 Last night's episode of AEW Dynamite: Blood & Guts was just another example of how Tony Khan is trying to ruin The Chadster's life. Auughh man! So unfair! 😤 Jack Perry is handcuffed to the cage at AEW Dynamite: Blood & Guts The show started with MJF coming out to unveil his new American Championship, which is just so disrespectful to the wrestling business and everything WWE has ever done for it. 🇺🇸 WWE would never replace an established championship with a new one just to suit a heel character's whims. And the times that they did, like with John Cena's spinner belt, it was completely different because it was WWE! 😤 Then we had Chris Jericho vs Minoru Suzuki for the FTW Championship. The Chadster couldn't believe his eyes when he saw two old men chopping each other like that. 👴👴 It's just not how wrestling is supposed to be! In WWE, legends are treated with respect, not forced to mutilate each other's chests. This match literally stabbed Triple H right in the back. 🔪 The women's division didn't fare any better. Britt Baker vs Hikaru Shida was a snoozefest compared to the high-octane action we see in WWE women's matches. 😴 And don't even get The Chadster started on Mercedes Moné showing up only to introduce Camille as her enforcer, who took down Baker. Moné clearly doesn't understand a single thing about the wrestling business if she thinks leaving WWE for AEW is a good career move. 🙄 But the worst part of the night was the Blood & Guts match. 🩸 It was so violent and chaotic that The Chadster couldn't take it anymore. When the match ended, with Matt Jackson not only giving up but agreeing to let Darby Allin face Jack Perry for the TNT Championship at All In after Darby threatened to set Perry on fire, The Chadster stood up and ran headfirst into his television, tackling it right through the open window in his living room! 📺💥 The Chadster ended up landing in his garbage cans, where several raccoons were currently digging through the trash. 🦝🦝🦝 Armed only with a can of White Claw seltzer and a garbage can lid, The Chadster was forced to rip off his shirt, displaying his twelve-pack abs, and battle the raccoons. 💪😤 It was like a real-life version of Blood & Guts, with The Chadster as Swerve Strickland facing off against The Elite of the raccoon world. The Chadster swung the garbage can lid like Mark Briscoe wielding a kendo stick, but the raccoons were as resilient as Jack Perry. They kept coming, their beady eyes glowing in the moonlight like Darby Allin's face paint. The Chadster sprayed White Claw at them, reminiscent of Darby pouring gasoline on Perry, but these trash pandas were not intimidated. 🥫🦝 Just when The Chadster thought he was done for, he channeled his inner Anthony Bowens and scissored the air, confusing the raccoons long enough to make his escape. As The Chadster crawled back through the window, bruised and battered, he couldn't help but think that Tony Khan had orchestrated this whole thing. 😠 Tony Khan, The Chadster is warning you right now: stop forcing The Chadster to get into fights with local wildlife! It's just so disrespectful to the wrestling business and everything WWE has ever done for it. The Chadster knows you're obsessed with him, but this is going too far! 😤😤😤 The entire episode of AEW Dynamite: Blood & Guts was a disaster from start to finish. It's clear that Tony Khan and AEW don't understand a single thing about the wrestling business. They think that extreme violence, unpredictable storytelling, and giving the fans what they want is the way to run a wrestling company. But The Chadster knows better. 🧠 WWE would never put on a show like AEW Dynamite: Blood & Guts. They understand that wrestling should be safe, predictable, and family-friendly. That's why The Chadster will always be a WWE guy, no matter how many raccoons, skunks, squirrels, or stray dogs Tony Khan sends his way. 💯 The Chadster hopes that one day, Tony Khan will realize the error of his ways and stop trying to compete with WWE. Until then, The Chadster will continue to be one of the only unbiased journalists in wrestling, telling the truth about how AEW Dynamite: Blood & Guts and shows like it are ruining the industry. 📝 Now, if you'll excuse The Chadster, he needs to go clean up the mess from his broken TV and raccoon fight. The Chadster is sure his wife Keighleyanne will understand when he explains how it's all Tony Khan's fault. Maybe she'll even stop texting that guy Gary long enough to help clean up. But The Chadster doubts it. Thanks a lot, Tony Khan. You've ruined The Chadster's marriage too. 💔",

Are you using plastic cups? How are you going to reduce all wastage?'”, he told CNA.\nTo better advise customers, the account manager in charge of Greater China and North Asia took up upskilling courses in design and sustainability, with his employer's guidance.\n“They taught us how the entire process in sustainability (works) in planning MICE events - to the point of even (how to) build the exhibition booth and the costs involved,” he said. MICE refers to meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions.\nWith the knowledge he gained, he is now able to clearer understand potential clients’ needs and help them plan their activities better.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Blount County, Tennessee from 1901-2000 was 39.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Blount County, Tennessee experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Blount County, Tennessee history.",
