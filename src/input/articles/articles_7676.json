    "text": "Help Net Security November 15, 2024 Share Cybercriminals hijack DNS to build stealth attack networks\nHijacking domains using a ‘Sitting Ducks attack’ remains an underrecognized topic in the cybersecurity community. Few threat researchers are familiar with this attack vector, and knowledge is scarce. However, the prevalence of these attacks and the risk to organizations are significant.\nInfoblox researchers estimate that over 1 million registered domains could be vulnerable daily.\nMore evidence found on Sitting Ducks Attacks During a Sitting Ducks attack, the malicious actor gains control of a domain by taking over its DNS configurations. Cybercriminals have used this vector since 2018 to hijack tens of thousands of domain names. Victim domains include well-known brands, non-profits, and government entities.\nInfoblox crafted a monitoring initiative after the initial paper on Sitting Ducks attacks was published in July 2024. The results are very sobering, as 800,000 vulnerable domains were identified, and about 70,000 were later identified as hijacked.\nThe Vipers and Hawks Feasting on Sitting Ducks Attacks Vacant Viper is one of the earliest known threat actors to exploit the Sitting Ducks attack and has hijacked an estimated 2,500 domains each year since December 2019. This actor uses hijacked domains to augment their malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) called 404TDS to run malicious spam operations, deliver porn, establish remote access trojan ( RAT ) C2s, and drop malware such as DarkGate and AsyncRAT.\nVacant Viper does not hijack domains for a specific brand connection but instead for domain resources with high reputations that security vendors will not block. The newly published report lists examples of attack chains showing redirection techniques used by the 404TDS and their affiliates, including how Vacant Viper uses hijacked domains in the 404TDS.\nVextrio Viper This actor has used hijacked domains as part of their massive TDS infrastructure since early 2020. Vextrio runs the most extensive known cybercriminal affiliate program, routing compromised web traffic to over 65 affiliate partners, some of whom have also stolen domains via ‘Sitting Ducks’ for their malicious activities.\nMany affiliates use a Russian antibot service to filter out bots and security researchers. The functionality of AntiBot includes the ability to set rules to block certain bot services or users based on their IP geolocation, user-agent, etc.\nHorrid Hawk and Hasty Hawk The animal designation of Hawks was given because the threat actors swoop in and hijack vulnerable domains, much like hawks dive down to snatch their prey. Infoblox has named several new actors thriving on hijacked domains.\nHorrid Hawk: A DNS threat actor that has been hijacking domains and using them for investment fraud schemes since at least February 2023. This actor is interesting because they use hijacked domains in every step of their campaigns, crafting convincing lures containing non-existent government investment programs or summits. They embed the hijacked domains in short-lived Facebook ads targeting users in over 30 languages, spanning multiple continents.\nHasty Hawk: Another threat actor discovered during our research into ‘Sitting Ducks’ hijackings. Since at least March 2022, Hasty Hawk has hijacked over 200 domains to operate widespread phishing that primarily spoof DHL shipping pages and fake donation sites to support Ukraine.\nThe actor exploits many providers, often reconfiguring hijacked domains to host content on Russian IPs. Hasty Hawk uses Google ads and other means, such as spam messages, to distribute malicious content. They also use a TDS to route users to different webpages that vary in content and language depending on their geolocation and other user characteristics. Hasty Hawk switches some of their domains back and forth between various campaign themes.\nMore about attacks cybercrime DNS hijacking Infoblox report Share",

    "text": "Al Jazeera English published this video item, entitled “Skunk water sprayed at worshippers near Al-Aqsa Mosque” – below is their description. There has been a skunk water truck which has been spraying water towards Palestinians and Muslim worshippers. This produces an awful smell, which has been drifting in the air. People have also been attacked with tear gas grenades. The reason why there are these confrontations is that, since October 7, there have been vast restrictions on Muslims entering the place they revere as the third holiest place in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. The Israelis are only allowing people over 45 years old, but even then, they can restrict them. We have only seen about 3,00 to 4,000 worshippers in the past two weeks. Usually, you’d have between 50,000 and 60,000 people praying in the mosque. So there’s been real tension here.Al Jazeera English YouTube Channel Got a comment?

    "text": "Bavaria, Germany, is a treasure trove of natural beauty, especially during fall when the forests turn into a vibrant palette of colors. The crisp air and the rustling leaves underfoot create an enchanting atmosphere for hikers. This guide highlights five must-visit forest trails that promise breathtaking views and a serene hiking experience in the heart of Bavaria's autumnal landscape. Tegernsee is more than just a lake; it's an autumnal wonderland surrounded by forests that blaze with color during the fall. The Neureuth trail offers panoramic views of the lake against a backdrop of golden larches and fiery maples. This moderate hike is about six kilometers long, making it perfect for a day trip filled with stunning vistas and peaceful moments in nature. Nestled on the border with Austria, Berchtesgaden National Park is renowned for its breathtaking alpine scenery and untouched woodlands. The Wimbachklamm gorge hike invites you on a journey through enchanting forests ablaze with autumn colors, alongside the soothing sounds of rushing streams and cascading waterfalls. This trail, ranging from easy to moderate difficulty, truly encapsulates the essence of Bavarian wilderness in the fall season. Just outside Nuremberg, the Lorenzer Reichswald is a dense forest rich in history and natural beauty. In fall, this area transforms into a vibrant mosaic of colors, making it perfect for leisurely hikes or bike rides along its well-marked paths. It's especially appealing for those eager to combine outdoor activities with a touch of historical exploration, offering a unique experience amidst the changing seasons. Near the famous Neuschwanstein Castle, Fussen offers hikers the Lechfall trail—a path that winds through vibrant forests alongside the Lech River. In autumn, this trail becomes even more magical as the foliage turns brilliant shades of orange and red. It's an easy hike suitable for all ages, offering enchanting views that seem straight out of a storybook. For those seeking adventure at higher altitudes, Garmisch-Partenkirchen offers the Partnachklamm gorge hike. This trail, encircled by cliffs adorned in autumn's palette, blends natural beauty with a physical challenge. Hikers can experience the beauty of cascading waterfalls weaving through forests of golden trees. This unforgettable journey showcases some of Bavaria's most spectacular landscapes, ideal for immersing oneself in the tranquility of nature's autumnal change.",
