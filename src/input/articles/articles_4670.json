    "text": "Boeing factory workers are poised to walk off the job, crippling manufacturing across the planemaker’s Seattle commercial jet hub after members of its largest union rejected a contract offer and voted to strike.\nThe walkout, from midnight Friday, is the first since 2008 by the district of the International Association of Machinists And Aerospace Workers representing 33,000 Boeing workers across the US West Coast. It adds to the strain on the company, already reeling from the fallout over quality lapses after a near-catastrophe at the start of 2024 that spurred investigations, a customer revolt and an executive shake-up.\nMembers ignored a plea for peace by new Boeing chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who has vowed to reset labour relations. And they bucked the recommendation of their own union leaders that they accept terms that included a 25 per cent guaranteed wage increase over four years. While that’s the largest such pay hike ever offered by the plane maker, workers had expected a far greater increase. They were also angered that the terms also eliminated an annual bonus.\nBoeing has been in a financially difficult situation since a January accident exposed deficiencies at its factories and forced the it to reduce production. The company has been bleeding cash as a result, and its credit rating is hovering one step above speculative grade, putting the firm in a difficult position as it contends with a heavy debt load of $45 billion (€40.6 billion).\nThe defeat at the hand of workers means that Boeing and IAM District 751 will need to head back to the negotiating table to try to find terms that satisfy members of a union with a long history of activism. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at TD Cowen, estimates the walkout could run for more than 50 days, in line with previous strikes, clipping between $3 billion and $3.5 billion from Boeing’s cash flow.\nBoeing has said its offer was the best it could put forward given its strained finances. The company hasn’t said how it would respond, but managers have been canvassing other workers this week to see if they have the skills to temporarily replace striking IAM members.\nIn the lead up to the late-night decision, IAM members outside of Boeing’s Renton factory where it builds 737 Max jetliners voiced anger at the offer and described the frustration of seeing wages stagnate under a long-term deal struck in 2014 that also eliminated pensions.\nThey’re also mad the company kept a provision that forces hourly workers to be on the job for six years before they reach the maximum pay categories.\n“I’m working stupid amounts of overtime just to get by,” said Zachary Haley, a 737 quality assurance inspector who’s been with Boeing for five years. ---Bloomberg",

    "text": "At just 14, Amani Smith was gunned down in the streets of Covington this week and his parents said it could have been prevented.\nAmani's mother, Amber Smith, said she'd been trying to get the Covington Independent School District to address threats directed at her older son since he got in a fight earlier this month.\nShe said it was this fight that led to the shooting on Tuesday on Decoursey Avenue. The teenage gunman was waiting for his older son, she said, but took aim at his little brother instead.\nSmith said her family knew there was trouble and tried to get officials at Holmes High School to address it.\n\"Everyone dismissed me,\" Smith said.\nAmani was found shot with another 14-year-old just before 3:30 p.m. Both teens were taken to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center where Amani was pronounced dead.\nSmith said the shooter, who has now been arrested, had gotten in a fight in the bathroom at school with her older son, Amani's brother.\nHe was suspended after the fight, which Smith said he did not start.\nFor her son, the conflict was over when the fight ended, Smith said, but then he started getting threatening social media messages.\nSmith said she went to the district and told them that the other teen was trying escalate things, but was ignored.\nShe said believes that the teen was waiting for her older son on Tuesday, but ended up seeing his little brother and fatally shooting him instead.\nSmith said she followed the chain of command and did everything she could to get district to intervene, but it didn't work.\nShe now plans to pull her children out of the district.\n'Too big to react' Smith said Amani and his older brother have spend their whole lives in Covington's Latonia neighborhood.\nShe's also struggled with the school district for years. Both of her boys are bigger than much of the other kids their age, and they were told to just take whatever abuse came their way.\n\"I was told they're too big to react,\" Smith said.\nShe said she is sick of not feeling supported by school and police officials.\nSince Amani was killed, Smith said there were false rumors being spread that her older son was going shoot up the school.\nSmith said police came to her home at 2 a.m. saying they were investigating the threat.\nShe asks: where were they weeks ago when I was trying to get help?\nArrest made The Covington Independent School District declined to comment on Smith's accusations. The district has called the killing tragic and said it was working to support its students and staff.\nA 17-year-old has been arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing. Covington police have not released the name of the teen due to his age.\nKenton County Commonwealth's Attorney Rob Sander said he expects the teen will be charged as an adult.",

The boy's family reported him missing around 11 a.m. Thursday near the Rancheria Campground, a site that sits along Huntington Lake and is surrounded by a dense forest of pine and fir trees of the Kaiser Wilderness, north of Fresno. A search-and-rescue team composed of 50 people, including Fresno County Sheriff deputies, forest rangers and volunteers, launched an extensive search for the missing child, who was last seen wearing shorts and a T-shirt, officials said. Around 8 a.m. Friday, roughly 22 hours after his disappearance, the boy was discovered in good condition about a quarter-mile from the campground. In a Facebook post, the Fresno County Sheriff's Office announced authorities had located the boy \"in good condition,\" noting that \"he was just tired and hungry.\" The boy has since been reunited with his parents. Authorities credited the collaboration of several law enforcement agencies and community members for finding the boy. \"This was an amazing show of teamwork and dedication,\" a post read from the Fresno County Sheriff's Office. \"Many people offered to help join the search, kept their eyes peeled, spread the word on social media and sent prayers up. All of this undoubtedly helped to bring (him) home safely.\" ©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com . Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "Right Under U.S. Nose, China Sneaks Into Subi Reef; Sets Up Military Base Just Miles Away From Philippines",
    "text": "With cracks already showing in the fragile peace established between China and the US-backed Philippines, a new video has surfaced revealing a fully operational Chinese military base at Subi Reef.\nAn aircraft belonging to the Philippines’ Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) was recently monitoring Chinese activity in Sandy Cay when it observed Chinese buildings and military hardware at the Subi Reef. These military structures were recorded in a video, which has since been published online and widely shared on social media.\nThe video reveals that the artificial island in Subi Reef, built by China in 2013, features large structures, including a runway, radar domes, antennas, vehicles, and hangars. The local Filipino media reported that the appearance of the fully functional, large military base follows years of unhindered construction of military facilities there.\nAccording to the reports , a large deepwater shelter port was also observed in the region, where Chinese ships could take refuge from high waves. Chinese maritime militia warships were also visible in the vicinity.\nF-22 vs J-20: US Air Force Gets Super Stealthy Raptors Close To China To Fight PLAAF’s Mighty Dragons\nThe Filipino military also confirmed the construction of the Chinese base on the same day the video was released. Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad, the navy’s spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, reportedly informed the media that China has completed the construction of large military structures, airstrips, and storage facilities in the region, which lies outside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) but within the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea of its Pag-asa Island.\nNaobserbahan ang naval at air base ng China sa Subi Reef, o mas kilala bilang Zamora Reef, sa isang aerial mission ng Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources #BFAR .\nNakapaloob ang Subi sa territorial sea ng Pag-asa Island. #News5 | via Gio Robles pic.twitter.com/8fJbhCC5ts\n— News5 (@News5PH) August 6, 2024\nTrinidad made the admission in an interview with GMA’s DZBB on August 6. Without mincing words, he said, “It is safe to assume that they have continued their maintenance and expansion little by little. As it is right now, it is a fully functional military base with naval and airforce capabilities.”\nTrinidad also said that the military buildings at Subi Reef are “not ordinary facilities,” noting that the Philippine Navy spotted enormous storage facilities presumably packed with ammunition and fuel. The Philippine Navy has observed Chinese coast guard vessels, marine militias, and naval forces approaching the island.\nF-16s “Sitting Ducks” For Russian MiG-31 Fighters? Putin Warns Of Consequences Over Fighting Falcons\nChina has militarised large swathes of the South China Sea, most of which it claims as its sovereign territory. For instance, US Indo-Pacific commander Admiral John C Aquilino stated in 2022 that China had completely militarized at least three of the artificial islands it constructed in the contested sea, outfitting them with fighter jets, laser and jamming technology, and anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems.\nHowever, the Subi Reef may be of particular concern to the Philippines as it is a part of the country’s continental shelf in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) and lies about 16 miles, or 26 kilometers, from Pag-asa or Thitu Island in Palawan. To put it in perspective, Thitu Island is one of the most prominent and strategically located islands in the South China Sea.\nChina Sits At The Subi Reef Since its occupation by mainland China in 1988, Subi Reef has served as the nation’s northernmost stronghold inside the Spratly Island group. Initially covered by water at high tide, the reef has since been converted into a permanent military facility due to Chinese construction.\nChina has been building military installations on Subi Reef and other artificial islands throughout the Spratly Islands since 2013 as part of dredging and island-building.\nIn his latest interaction with the media, Filipino navy spokesperson Trinidad said China has maintained and expanded on Subi Reef and other characteristics in the West Philippine Sea despite the 2016 arbitral tribunal decision that nullified its expansive claim to almost the whole South China Sea.\nSix B-52 Bombers ‘Shot Down’ In One Night: How Russian AD Missiles Wreaked Havoc On Stratofortress During Vietnam War\nWhile China has been militarizing the reef since at least 2014, the extent of militarisation may be concerning for Manila as it comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Philippines and China over territorial disputes, including instances of physical assault of Filipino forces by the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG). The assault happened at the Second Thomas Shoal, where a Filipino vessel, Sierra Madre, functions as a Filipino outpost.\nAerial view of the ‘militarized’ Subi Reef (via X) The two countries have since come a long way, with a provisional agreement establishing a fragile and shaky peace in the region. However, it has done little to change the situation on the ground. With a fragile agreement in effect that is beginning to reveal weaknesses, the substantial Chinese military presence just a few miles from a key Filipino island raises concerns.\nThis becomes particularly noteworthy in light of previous incidents where Chinese forces have harassed researchers and fishermen working around the Thitu Islands in the Philippines. There have also been several instances of Chinese vessels sailing close to the Thitu Island.\nThe Filipino military has not expressed a particular threat from the Chinese military base in the region. But, Trinidad said that his country had no choice except to ask the international community for assistance in upholding the 2016 ruling—barring the possibility of war.\nNonetheless, EurAsian Times spoke to Miguel Miranda, a Philippines-based military analyst, to understand the extent of the threat posed by the Chinese military at Subi.\nWhat Does Subi’s Militarization Mean For Manila? When asked whether China appears to be preparing for a potential future military showdown, given the small distance between Subi and Thitu, Miguel said: “Certainly. The sheer size of the Subi Reef airbase is enormous. The length of the runway and nearby hangars look like they can support multiple flights of medium-lift transports. The island itself is shaped like a harbor. The Philippines’ own Pagasa Island has an airstrip for C-130s and an upcoming port for small ships to dock. The problem is the island is almost surrounded by the Chinese coast guard.”\nFile Image: Russia China Naval Drills Miguel also cleared the air surrounding a key question asked by netizens: Whether the Philippines have anything to thwart this militarisation? Miguel said, “Subi Reef’s location falls outside the EEZ of the Philippines, and, more importantly, there’s an armada of Chinese ships always present in the nearby waters. Our ships are outnumbered and outgunned.”\nWhen this correspondent asked about the long-term repercussions of this massive militarization, Miguel said rather categorically: “It’s obvious that aside from vast numbers, China has superior intelligence and infrastructure in these waters. The result? Long-term conflict.”\nVoila, the maritime salami slicing of China has turned a clean #Subi reef, into an advanced military base! And who gave them the sanction to do that, when it lies within the EEZ of Phillipines? 1/2 @informedph2 @pin pic.twitter.com/GuylVK9B8R\n— Nguyen Ho (@NguyenHo1096438) August 7, 2024\nHaving said that, the Philippines has also been strengthening its presence on Thitu Island to counter China’s expansion. Manila’s military chief, Romeo Brawner, announced in January this year that the Philippines plans to develop the islands in the South China Sea that it claims as its territory to improve living conditions for troops.\nThis includes the Thitu Islands. Additionally, last month, Manila began the construction of an airport on the island as part of its larger strategy to strengthen its presence in the region.\nIn addition to the Philippines, its treaty ally, the United States, is likely to closely monitor the Chinese military base at Subi, especially as it has increased its presence in the country in response to escalating threats from Beijing’s military actions in the region. Last year, the US secured access to four new Filipino bases in addition to the five that it has been accessing for a while under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).\nThe US, on its part, has strongly condemned China’s militarisation of the South China Sea, along with its growing expansion in the region.\nContact the author at sakshi.tiwari9555 (at) gmail.com Follow EurAsian Times on Google News",

    "text": "Las relaciones de pareja se construyen y se mantienen con palabras y acciones. Sin embargo, ciertas frases y comportamientos, especialmente en momentos de tensión, pueden indicar o incluso precipitar una crisis. Reconocer y entender estas señales es crucial para evaluar la salud de una relación y decidir si se puede salvar o si está destinada al fracaso . En el mundo de las relaciones personales, especialmente las románticas, el equilibrio entre momentos de felicidad y conflictos es delicado. La Dra. Cortney S. Warren, psicóloga con formación en Harvard y autora de reconocidos textos sobre parejas, identifica frases específicas que, al ser pronunciadas, pueden ser particularmente destructivas. Según su experiencia de 20 años en el asunto, la expresión “ ojalá nunca nos hubiéramos conocido ” es la que más escuchó y, para ella, sugiere un profundo arrepentimiento y resentimiento, y a menudo presagia el final de una relación.\nLas relaciones de pareja se construyen y se mantienen con dialogo fluido Foto ilustrativa: PIXABAY",

La mujer, que se encontraba acompañada por otras personas, sufrió una fractura de tobillo que le impedía continuar el camino por sus propios medios.\nEl aviso se recibió el pasado 29 de junio a través de la central, que alertó a los agentes de la Comandancia de Algeciras de la emergencia. Al tratarse de un entorno abrupto e inaccesible en vehículo, los guardias civiles recurrieron a una vía alternativa que les permitió aproximarse lo máximo posible con el coche oficial.\nGracias al contacto telefónico con los acompañantes y al uso de la sirena como referencia sonora, los agentes lograron localizar una zona cercana al lugar del accidente. Desde allí, continuaron a pie hasta alcanzar a la herida, a la que ayudaron a incorporarse y trasladaron a pulso hasta el vehículo, desde donde fue evacuada a un centro médico para recibir atención sanitaria.\nEl sendero de la Mariposa, conocido por su belleza natural y por albergar ejemplares de mariposa monarca en determinadas épocas del año, es uno de los recorridos más frecuentados por los amantes del senderismo en el Campo de Gibraltar.",

    "text": "Detroit Lions coordinators talk up Jameson Williams, Terrion Arnold: 'Iron sharpens iron' Dave Birkett Detroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nLions rookie Terrion Arnold knows Matthew Stafford likely to target him Detroit Lions rookie cornerback Terrion Arnold on Thursday, Sept. 5 prepares for his first test vs. Matthew Stafford and Rams in NFL opener. Count Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson among those expecting a breakout season from wide receiver Jameson Williams this fall.\nWilliams finished sixth on the Lions with 24 catches for 354 yards last season, but is slated to play as the No. 2 receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown this year.\nJohnson said Thursday his confidence level in Williams is \"as high as it’s ever been and continuing to climb,\" and joined the chorus of coaches who said they've seen Williams take major steps forward on and off the field entering his third NFL season.\nBOLD WORDS: Aaron Glenn expects Lions 'to be a damn good defense' with Aidan Hutchinson starring\n\"As a player, as a route runner, as a receiver, and then off the field just his preparation, how he’s talking care of his body, his demeanor with his teammates and interactions with them,\" Johnson said. \"He’s come a very long way and so he’s just going to continue to grow and the more reps he gets he’s going to make mistakes and he’s going to learn from them and that’s the best thing, most encouraging thing we’ve seen is, since he’s been out on the field, he rarely makes the same mistake twice.”\nJohnson and fellow Lions coordinators Aaron Glenn and Dave Fipp held their weekly media sessions Thursday. Here are more highlights.\nRole reversal Glenn had good things to say about Williams, too, as well as the looks the young receiver has given his new defensive backs to help them get ready for the season.\n“Listen, iron sharpens iron in this business so the guys that we have as corners going against Jamo, I think it made both guys better,\" Glenn said. \"I expect Jamo to do what Jamo do, and that’s run past people and make plays in the deep part of the field. So, listen, I’m a huge fan of that player. Me and him have a really good relationship, and I try to push him just as much as I push anybody else because he has the talent to be able to do it. So I look forward to watching him operate this whole season.\"\nJohnson, similarly, offered praise for rookie cornerback Terrion Arnold, calling him \"sticky.\"\n\"He’s sticky as all get out, so he’s given us some issues there during training camp, one-on-ones, and we’ve tried to pick on him a little bit and it hasn’t been super successful,\" Johnson said. \"So I’m encouraged to see where he’s at. He certainly lets you know he’s out there, in more ways than one. It’s good.”\nPatience pays NFL teams have a long history of playing things safe at the kicker position. It's easier to stick with a trusted veteran than it is to develop a raw rookie, even if the young player has considerably more upside.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals did that in 2017, when they picked Randy Bullock over fifth-round pick Jake Elliott as their kicker, and Fipp was with the Philadelphia Eagles when that team signed Elliott off the Bengals' practice squad early that year. Elliott made his first Pro Bowl a few years later and was a second-team All-Pro selection last year.\nMore: Detroit Lions season preview: Depth chart, what to expect from newcomers on defense\nFipp reiterated that he and the Lions plan to have patience with young kicker Jake Bates this fall. He stressed that Bates has to \"do his part\" to keep the job, but said Bates has unique leg talent and the Lions are willing to weather some ups and downs.\n\"I’m really excited about him,\" Fipp said. \"He’s one of the most talented players I’ve been around at that position. I think all the guys on the other teams in the preseason watch him warm up and are like, ‘Oh my gosh, this guy’s incredible.’ So he has a tremendous upside, which if you’re going to invest in a player and take a chance, you definitely want to do it with a guy who can turn out to be a really good player for you. I think we have to be patient with him.\"\nBranch bouncing around Brian Branch may start at safety for the Lions this fall after playing primarily as a slot cornerback last year, but that doesn't mean he'll be anchored to only the safety position.\n\"That doesn’t mean that he’s not going to play nickel, so I want to get that out of everybody’s head right now,\" Glenn said. \"He’s going to play safety, he’s going to play nickel, he’s going to play dime, so he’s going to be all over the place and the reason why we’re doing that is because he’s a damn good player so we’re going to put him in position to make plays.\"\nBranch was one of the Lions' most productive defenders last season with 74 tackles, three interceptions and one sack. He showed advanced instincts as a rookie, and Glenn said he's been more vocal in his new role.\n\"You’re talking about a man that’s upped his communications, that upped his leadership skills as far as influencing guys,\" Glenn said. \"He’s done that and he’s done it at a high rate, in my opinion.”\nOffensive ingenuity The Lions' new-look secondary will get its first major test Sunday against a Los Angeles Rams passing game led by quarterback Matthew Stafford, with two productive receivers in Puka Nacua (105 catches, 1,486 yards, 6 TDs in 2023) and Cooper Kupp (59-737-5).\nGlenn called the Nacua-Kupp duo \"damn good\" and said their effectiveness is enhanced by the rest of the Rams' offense.\n\"I think their running back’s a hell of a player,\" Glenn said of Kyren Williams. \"Obviously we know the one that was drafted from Michigan (in Blake Corum), he’s going to be a good player, but the way that they challenge you with all the pre-snap movements and then they get to a simple play, I think he’s the epitome of, ‘Man, listen, make everything look complex, but we’re just doing simple plays.’ And I think that’s great for an offense, and (Rams coach Sean McVay) does that. So the thing that we’ve got to be good with is, ‘Don’t get caught up in all the eye candy, understand exactly who they are and how they run their plays and go make those plays.’\"\nInjury report Ifeatu Melifonwu took part in individual drills during the open portion of practice Wednesday, while D.J. Reader worked out with a sled on the side while his teammates went through position drills. Undrafted rookie Loren Strickland remains out with a thumb injury.\nDave Birkett is the author of the new book, \" Detroit Lions : An Illustrated Timeline.\" Preorder it now from Reedy Press .\nContact him at dbirkett@freepress.com .
