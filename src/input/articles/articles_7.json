    "title": "Utsev: Harnessing Nigeria’s WaterResources for Economic Gains",
    "text": "Politics | 3 hours ago\nTolulope Adebayo writes that the Minister of Water Resources, Prof Joseph Utsev, has brought his expertise to bear on the nation’s water sector since he assumed office almost a year ago.\nUnder President Bola Tinubu’s administration, the Ministry of Water Resources and Sanitation has experienced a remarkable resurgence, led by the visionary leadership of Professor Joseph Utsev. As the Minister of Water Resources, Utsev has leveraged his vast expertise and experience in water resources and environmental engineering to champion groundbreaking initiatives addressing the nation’s complex water challenges.\nHailing from Buruku Local Government Area of Benue State, Nigeria, Utsev boasts an impressive academic pedigree having graduated with distinction from the Federal University of Agriculture (now JOSTUM), Makurdi, in 2004, earning a Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Civil Engineering with Second Class Honours (Upper Division) as the best student in his cohort. He then pursued advanced studies at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, earning a Master’s degree in Water Resources and Environmental Engineering in 2007 and a PhD in the same field in 2011.\nUtsev’s illustrious career spans approximately 17 years, marked by distinguished tenures in academia and the engineering field. He has accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise, earning widespread recognition and acclaim as a consummate administrator and highly esteemed professional. A prolific scholar, he has authored approximately 40 scholarly papers published in esteemed national and international journals, solidifying his standing as a leading authority in his field.\nAs Minister of Water Resources, Utsev has drawn upon his extensive experience to address flooding and erosion across the country. His academic background and professional expertise have enabled him to devise innovative solutions addressing the root causes of these problems. His leadership has fostered a culture of inclusivity and effectiveness, characterized by a silent intellectual approach focused on results-driven initiatives and collaborative governance.\nUtsev’s most outstanding achievement yet has been his remarkable aptitude for augmenting and expanding existing initiatives, tailoring and refining them to harmonize with the pragmatic nuances of the situation. He has expertly recalibrated, adopted, or adapted policies to align with his visionary objectives for the water sector, demonstrating mastery of strategic adaptation and leadership.\nUnder his leadership, the Ministry of Water Resources has made significant progress in water infrastructure development, irrigation projects, and water supply expansion, enhancing the nation’s water security. His commitment to a water-secure Nigeria has led to the implementation of innovative technologies and sustainable practices, ensuring equal access to clean water and sanitation for all citizens.\nUtsev’s appointment as Minister of Water Resources and Sanitation marks a homecoming, with an expanded purview that affords him the opportunity to leverage his intellectual approach to governance, cultivating synergy and inclusivity among diverse stakeholders. Through his commitment to transparency and accountability, he has earned the esteem and trust of the Nigerian populace, inspiring confidence in the ministry’s programs and initiatives.\nAs a silent intellectual, Utsev exemplifies leadership by example, dedicating himself selflessly to the service of the nation and its people. His efforts have begun to yield concrete results, positioning Nigeria for a brighter future where water resources are optimally harnessed for sustainable development, economic growth, and human betterment. His steadfast commitment to public service, combined with his legal acumen and expertise, makes him the perfect fit for President Tinubu’s administration.\nAs the nation marks the first anniversary of the Tinubu administration, Utsev’s contributions to the water sector stand out as a testament to the transformative power of silent intellectual leadership, demonstrating the impact of dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to shaping a better Nigeria.\n• Adebayo writes from Badagry, Lagos.\nRelated Articles",

    "text": "Manassas Plumbing Pros In a significant stride towards environmental sustainability, Manassas Plumbing Pros has introduced a range of innovative eco-friendly plumbing solutions. Recognized for their commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, this plumbing company is set to revolutionize the industry with their green initiatives. Homeowners and businesses alike are expected to benefit from these cutting-edge technologies and practices, which aim to conserve water, reduce energy consumption, and minimize environmental impact.\nThe introduction of eco-friendly solutions by this plumbing company Manassas is a testament to their dedication to both their customers and the environment. In recent years, the necessity for sustainable practices has been increasingly emphasized, with climate change and resource depletion becoming pressing global issues. The adoption of green plumbing practices not only addresses these concerns but also offers numerous benefits to property owners, including cost savings and improved system efficiency.\nWater Conservation Technologies\nOne of the primary focuses of Manassas Plumbing Pros’ eco-friendly initiative is water conservation. Advanced technologies and practices have been employed to significantly reduce water wastage. Low-flow fixtures, such as taps, showerheads, and toilets, have been introduced, which use considerably less water compared to traditional fixtures. These low-flow alternatives maintain high performance while drastically cutting down on water usage, thus contributing to substantial water savings over time.\nFurthermore, dual-flush toilets have been made available, offering users the option to use different volumes of water for liquid and solid waste. This simple yet effective solution can result in considerable water conservation, especially in larger households and commercial properties. Rainwater harvesting systems have also been promoted, allowing the collection and utilization of rainwater for non-potable uses such as irrigation and flushing toilets.\nEnergy-Efficient Water Heaters\nAnother significant aspect of the eco-friendly solutions introduced by this plumbing company is the promotion of energy-efficient water heaters. Traditional water heaters can be highly energy-intensive, contributing to increased energy bills and a larger carbon footprint. In contrast, energy-efficient water heaters, such as tankless and solar water heaters, offer a more sustainable alternative.\nTankless water heaters, which heat water on demand, have been highlighted for their ability to provide a continuous supply of hot water while using significantly less energy. Solar water heaters, which utilize solar energy to heat water, represent an even more environmentally friendly option, harnessing renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. By encouraging the adoption of these energy-efficient water heaters, Manassas Plumbing Pros aims to help customers lower their energy consumption and decrease their overall environmental impact.\nLeak Detection and Prevention\nWater leaks, both minor and major, can lead to significant water wastage and property damage. Innovative leak detection and prevention technologies have been introduced by this plumbing company near me to address these issues effectively. Advanced leak detection systems, which utilize sensors and real-time monitoring, allow for the early identification and repair of leaks, preventing water loss and potential damage.\nAutomatic shut-off valves, which can be installed to stop the water supply in the event of a detected leak, provide an additional layer of protection. These systems are particularly beneficial in preventing extensive damage and costly repairs, offering peace of mind to homeowners and business owners alike. The proactive approach to leak detection and prevention taken by Manassas Plumbing Pros underscores their commitment to conserving water and protecting their customers’ properties.\nSustainable Plumbing Materials\nIn addition to implementing water-saving and energy-efficient technologies, the use of sustainable plumbing materials has been prioritized by Manassas Plumbing Pros. Traditional plumbing materials, such as PVC and other plastics, can have a detrimental impact on the environment due to their non-biodegradable nature and the pollution associated with their production. To counteract this, eco-friendly alternatives, such as PEX piping and copper, have been adopted.\nPEX piping, known for its durability and flexibility, is not only easier to install but also has a lower environmental impact compared to traditional materials. Copper, a recyclable and long-lasting material, offers a sustainable choice for plumbing installations. By choosing these environmentally friendly materials, the plumbing company near me is furthering its commitment to reducing its ecological footprint and promoting sustainable practices within the industry.\nCustomer Education and Engagement\nAn integral part of the eco-friendly initiative by Manassas Plumbing Pros involves educating and engaging their customers. It is recognized that for significant change to occur, it is essential for customers to be informed about the benefits and importance of adopting green plumbing practices. To this end, the plumbing company has launched various educational campaigns and resources, including informational brochures, workshops, and online content.\nCustomers are encouraged to participate in the eco-friendly movement by making small yet impactful changes, such as upgrading to low-flow fixtures, regularly checking for leaks, and considering the installation of energy-efficient water heaters. By fostering a culture of sustainability and environmental responsibility, Manassas Plumbing Pros aims to create a lasting positive impact within the community.\nThe launch of innovative eco-friendly plumbing solutions by Manassas Plumbing Pros marks a significant milestone in the plumbing industry. By prioritizing water conservation, energy efficiency, and the use of sustainable materials, this plumbing company Manassas is leading the way toward a more sustainable future. Homeowners and businesses are invited to join in these efforts, benefitting from reduced water and energy bills, while also contributing to the preservation of the environment. Through continued education and engagement, Manassas Plumbing Pros is poised to make a lasting difference, one plumbing system at a time.\nManassas Plumbing Pros is a leading plumbing company in Manassas, renowned for its commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction.

That’s why [Partners for Peace](https://www.partnersforpeaceme.org/) has launched their ‘Annual Be a Light Gift Card Drive’ for the third year. While they host many holiday drives, this residential program will provide survivors with funds to help survivors enjoy shopping for their families this holiday season. They’re collecting $5,000 in Visa, Walmart, and Hannaford gift cards. “We heard from survivors that it’s most helpful for them to be able to do their own Christmas and holiday shopping,” said Casey Faulkingham, director of development and engagement at Partners for Peace. “It’s also a lot more empowering.” They’re collecting these donations through Dec. 1, but are always welcoming donations for survivors. Gift cards can be mailed to PO Box 653, Bangor, ME 04402-0653 Re: Be A Light.

    "text": "Personally, I’ve had experience with any number of incredibly creative and talented people who couldn’t market their way out of a wet paper sack. And I totally get it. When you’re using all of your talent to build things, other things fall by the wayside. That’s why I’m glad to see folks trying to solve that problem for promising entrepreneurs — and everyone else. Meet\nBLUPRNT.\nIn the past, businesses would invest large amounts of time and money into a once-every-few-years strategic workshop to establish their market positioning, value proposition, the works… because these experiences were highly time consuming and expensive, most anyone who has gone through the experience has become conditioned to believe that this is not an iterative process – with BLUPRNT, startups can update any element of their identity, customer profile or competitive set in a few minutes and in doing so, change their market positioning almost instantly. This allows startups to iterate their brand as often as any other element of their business. Cool, right?\nI had a chance to test drive an early version of this. And as a marketing person for the last — checks watch — 30 years or so, I have to say that, even in its formative stages, the tool helped reveal some interesting insights and focus points. So even if you consider yourself a marketing-type, it’s still worth a look.\nBest of all? BLUPRNT struck me as a practical example of leveraging AI for a specific market that might not be comfortable with AI. It didn’t strike me as an “AI for AI’s sake” sort of pursuit.\nThe product starts at $99/year and is currently taking on new users. In fact,\nthey appeared on Product Hunt today. (So if you’re into that sort of thing, maybe swing by and support them.)\nAnd another fun fact: BLUPRNT cofounder Austin Buell was the one who did this\ninteresting analysis of the 2024 Oregon Innovation Index using AI.\nFor more information, visit\nBLUPRNT.",

    "title": "La Virgen de la Soledad en la cultura de Oaxaca, fervor y fiesta - México Desconocido",
    "text": "[Conoce México](https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/conoce-mexico) La Virgen de la Soledad en la cultura de Oaxaca, fervor y fiesta Exploraremos las festividades, procesiones y rituales que envuelven a la Virgen de la Soledad en tierras oaxaqueñas. En el corazón de la rica cultura oaxaqueña, la figura de la Virgen de la Soledad se alza como un faro de devoción y tradición. Esta icónica representación mariana, venerada con fervor en la región, se convierte en un hilo sagrado que une a la comunidad con su herencia espiritual. Leyenda de la Virgen de la Soledad Narra una leyenda de 1617 que un arriero se dirigía de Guatemala a Veracruz, y al llegar a la ermita de San Sebastián en la ciudad de Oaxaca, se le echó una mula ante el peso descomunal de una caja que cargaba. No hubo poder humano que levantara al animal para hacerlo andar. Cuando el obispo fray Bartolomé Bohorquez ordenó que se abriera la caja, se percató que contenía una imagen de Cristo junto con una cabeza de Virgen y un par de manos labradas, así como un rótulo que decía “Nuestra Señora de la Soledad al pie de la Cruz”. Ante esta situación el obispo ordenó que se construyera un santuario para venerar a la Virgen. Este sitio se inició anexo al convento de las monjas agustinas recoletas de Santa Mónica en 1682 y se terminó en 1689. Sin embargo, para hermosear la finca, en 1718 se terminó la fachada adosada, de biombo, que ahora conocemos. Su arquitecto fue el fraile Sebastián de San Phelipe. La Basílica La Basílica de la Virgen de la Soledad es un tesoro religioso que forma parte importante para el culto a la patrona de Oaxaca. Desde el primer vistazo, la portada de cantera se erige como una joya esculpida con maestría. Como un biombo de piedra, sus detalles tallados en diversas canteras cuentan la historia de fe y devoción. La Virgen de la Soledad encuentra su hogar en este santuario, donde la devoción que despierta se asemeja a la que se le brinda a nivel nacional a la Virgen de Guadalupe. La portada principal del recinto, un barroco del siglo XVII, se destaca como una obra única en la ciudad. La forma de biombo y el escalonamiento de sus cuerpos crean una apariencia imponente, como un gigantesco contrafuerte que se alza con gracia. Adentrarse en ella implica explorar un diseño celestial en forma de cruz latina, pues la nave central, abrazada por bóvedas vaídas, nos guía hacia el crucero, coronado por una cúpula de gajos que se apoya en un tambor octagonal. Por otro lado, los transeptos, acunados por bóvedas de cañón, y el ábside, envuelto en bóveda vaída, nos envuelven en la solemnidad del lugar. El sotocoro, joya del primer tramo, nos recibe con grandes impostas que sostienen el arco, soportando la plataforma del coro. Aquí, la madera esculpida y el órgano de fuelle se erigen como testigos silenciosos de la música sagrada. El patio atrial, enmarcado por dos sencillas portadas, conecta el templo con el jardín Sócrates y la Plaza de la Danza, por lo que crea un espacio que invita a la reflexión y la contemplación. Celebraciones a la Virgen de la Soledad Los festejos a la Virgen de la Soledad se realizan en diferentes épocas del año. El fervor a la santa patrona se desborda en respeto durante la Cuaresma, se viste de dolor en el Viernes Santo y se transforma en puro júbilo el 18 de diciembre de cada año. A partir de las 18:00 horas, comienza un mágico convite que recorre los barrios de la ciudad, visitando a los padrinos que ofrecen manjares y bebidas a los participantes. El regreso al templo, entre la 01:00 y las 02:00 horas de la madrugada, marca el cierre de esta procesión llena de alegría y tradición. Durante el novenario, la ciudad se despierta con el rezo del rosario a las 05:00 horas, seguido de la primera misa a las 06:00. Las rendidas de culto, a las 12:00 y 19:00 horas, son verdaderos espectáculos, con bandas de música, cohetes y mujeres vestidas con trajes regionales. Sin embargo, la fiesta principal se realiza anualmente los 18 de diciembre a la medianoche. Por ello se realiza la primera misa en punto de las 00:00 horas, luego sigue la entonación de las mañanitas. Posteriormente, a las 04:00 horas, las calles se llenan de fervor con el rezo del Rosario, que concluye alrededor de las 05:30 horas. A lo largo del día, [misas](https://www.facebook.com/Basilica.Soledad/?locale=es_LA) se celebran cada hora hasta las 9:00 de la noche. Desde convites y novenarios hasta calendas y procesiones, la festividad abraza una rica variedad de actividades, incluyendo fuegos artificiales, danzas, quermeses, antojitos populares y audiciones musicales. ¿Conoces los festejos a la Virgen de Guadalupe en Tlahuitoltepec, Oaxaca?

    "title": "Boeing Machinists union votes to strike",
    "text": "Boeing Machinists union votes to strike\nOne of Boeing’s largest unions overwhelmingly voted Thursday to strike, rejecting a tentative contract offer from the company\nin dramatic fashion.\nMore than 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are poised to strike as soon as their previous contract expires at midnight PT,\nhobbling airplane assembly at Boeing’s factories in the Seattle area. The work stoppages will also occur in Portland, Ore. and in southern California.\nThe machinists\nrejected the contract by 94% and 96% voted to strike.\nOn Sunday, the union's bargaining unit announced it reached\na tentative agreement with Boeing after months of negotiations. But it didn't take long for union members to begin complaining the proposal was not good enough. IAM 751 Union president Jon Holden wrote to workers, \"We recommended acceptance because we can't guarantee we can achieve more in a strike.\"\nThe deal would have raised wages by 25%, lowered employees’ share of health care costs, and boosted retirement contributions by the company. In addition, Boeing promised that the company's next plane would be built at its facilities in the Pacific northwest — rather than at Boeing's non-unionized plant in South Carolina. But many rank and file union members were unhappy with the offer, which fell short of the 40% raise and pension changes that the union was seeking.\nThe strike vote comes at a difficult time for Boeing, which is already grappling with a safety crisis after a door plug panel\nblew out of a 737 Max jet in midair in January. That forced the company to slow production of its best-selling plane as it works to shore up quality control across its factories and supply chain, and rebuild trust with airlines, regulators and the flying public.\nBefore the vote, new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg urged workers to approve the contract. “A strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together,” Ortberg said in a letter to employees in Washington and Oregon.\nThe\nlast strike by Boeing machinists in 2008 dragged on for eight weeks, costing the company an estimated $2 billion.\nCopyright 2024 NPR",

Ce bébé de déjà deux mètres de haut se porte bien et reste pour le moment bien au chaud dans la nurserie avec sa mère. Il s'agit du premier petit de la girafe Valeye et du mâle Matombu, décédé au début de l'année. Valeye \"s'est montrée très surprise à la naissance et s'est contentée d'observer le girafon. C'est lorsque la grand-mère Barbie, rompue à l'exercice, s'est penchée par-dessus la paroi en bois pour lécher le petit girafon que Valeye a compris ce qu'on attendait d'elle\", retrace le parc. La mère se montre depuis lors très attentive, avec l'aide de ses congénères. La gestation dure 15 mois chez les girafes. Au moment de sa naissance, le bébé fait une chute de deux mètres environ avant de se relever sur ses longues pattes. Un individu adulte peut en effet mesurer jusqu'à 5,5 mètres. Le girafon malinois contribue à perpétuer l'espèce du Kordofan, en danger d'extinction. Elle se retrouve aujourd'hui principalement au Parc national de la Garamba, dans le nord-est de la République Démocratique du Congo. Les conflits armés, le braconnage et la perte de leur habitat menacent leur survie. Le prénom du girafon n'a pas encore été choisi. Il commencera par la lettre \"z\", comme \"tous les animaux qui naissent au zoo de Planckendael en 2024\".",

    "text": "Workers at the IKEA stores in Haarlem and Amsterdam begin strike on Friday\nEmployees at the IKEA stores in Haarlem and Amsterdam will go on strike for 24 hours on Friday. According to the FNV, this is an extension in the push for a new collective bargaining agreement: instead of a strike at one store, there will now be strikes at two locations of the home furniture stores.\nThe trade union is demanding a wage increase of seven percent. FNV board member Danielle Wiek thinks that this would be sufficient compensation for inflation for the staff members and would also increase their purchasing power. According to the trade union, IKEA’s last offer was 2.4 percent.\nIKEA previously reported that salaries have already risen considerably in recent years, making them relatively high for the retail sector at the Swedish company. In addition, cost increases and a decline in turnover offer little room for a significant wage increase, the company stated.\nIn addition to a higher salary, the workers are also demanding that the work pressure be reduced. This will be the latest in a long line of strikes that have taken place at a IKEA store. Previous strikes took place in Heerlen, Utrecht, Delft, Haarlem, and Groningen.\nReporting by ANP and NL Times",

    "text": "News Search | All News Topics > Music Industry ; Press Releases by Industry Channel > [All Music Industry Press Releases](/pr_archive) Regional Water District for its Transparency Efforts TEXAS, March 14 - March 14, 2024 Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar Announces Updates to Transparency Stars Program; Applauds Tarrant Regional Water District for its Transparency Efforts (AUSTIN) — Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar today announced updates to his agency’s Transparency Stars program and applauded the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) for achieving a historic level of transparency for its open government practices. “Our agency has always been a champion of government transparency, and we are constantly looking for new ways to recognize best practices of local governments that are open and transparent with their taxpayers’ dollars,” Hegar said. \"When I took over as Comptroller, I wanted to create a program that could evolve with changing technologies and would incentivize transparency efforts that not only gave taxpayers access to the information they need and deserve, but also one that presented that information in a useful and understandable way. I am proud of the Transparency Stars program and the efforts of participating local governments.\" The program, created by Hegar in 2016, was designed to help entities realize greater transparency and increase taxpayer confidence in local governance. The Comptroller’s office awards stars to local entities in the areas of Traditional Finances, Contracts and Procurement, Economic Development, Public Pensions, Debt Obligations, and Open Government and Compliance. Hegar presented TRWD with the Open Government and Compliance star during a TRWD public meeting in Fort Worth earlier this month. TRWD is the first local entity in the state to receive all six Transparency Stars. The Open Government and Compliance star, created by the Comptroller’s office recently, recognizes an entity’s efforts to ensure open government by making its public meetings and information about board members easily accessible online. “The latest Transparency Star is timely as online tools have proliferated and improved in recent years,\" Hegar said. \"The COVID pandemic highlighted the need to be able to stream events and expand online access to a variety of services, whether health care, education or government. For example, by ensuring that constituents can stream a local entity’s board meeting, or by having an archive of that meeting available, citizens can more easily engage in the process of governance. I congratulate TRWD for becoming the first entity to earn six stars, for their efforts to ensure open government and for going above and beyond their peers in putting their information in the public square.” The Transparency Stars program recognizes government entities that accomplish the following: - Open their books in the areas of traditional finances, contracts and procurement, economic development, public pensions, debt obligations, and open government and compliance. - Provide clear and meaningful financial information by posting financial documents, as well as thorough summaries, visualizations, downloadable data and other relevant information. Go to the Comptroller’s website for more information and to find out how to apply for the Transparency Stars awards .
