    "text": "Ex-officials allege US reverse-engineered alien tech for ‘secretive arms race’ The report asserts that the U.S. executive branch has been managing UAP intelligence for years without Congressional supervision. Stock photo of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Further expanding upon our coverage of the November 13 House subcommittee hearing, witnesses, including former Pentagon officials, claimed that the U.S. government had withheld extensive information on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs)—more commonly known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs)—for decades. This testimony follows prior claims from intelligence officials about covert UAP recovery programs, fueling calls for government transparency. Luis Elizondo, former head of the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), testified that UAPs are real and that the United States and other nations possess advanced technologies that do not originate from any known government. According to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4989539-house-uap-secrecy-hearing/), “Advanced technologies…are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,” Elizondo said, adding that the U.S. has engaged in a “multidecade, secretive arms race” centered around UAP technology. Claims of non-human technology, secret arms race During the [hearing](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/ufos-are-real-tracking-military), Elizondo was joined by several other witnesses, including Michael Shellenberger, who presented a report on a UAP program allegedly codenamed “Immaculate Constellation.” The report asserts that the U.S. executive branch has been managing UAP intelligence for years without Congressional supervision. According to Shellenberger, the program has amassed a significant amount of visual and sensor-based evidence, reportedly including “high-resolution photos” and direct observational data of UAPs. Shellenberger claimed there could be “hundreds, maybe thousands” of pieces of evidence withheld from the public, contrasting these high-quality images with the blurry visuals released in the past. His statement underscored concerns that the U.S. military and intelligence sectors have long concealed vital information about UAPs from elected officials. The hearing builds on last year’s testimony by former intelligence officer David Grusch, who alleged the existence of a government program dedicated to reverse-engineering non-human technology. Grusch’s claims were supported by [firsthand accounts](https://jalopnik.com/us-recovered-alien-vehicles-non-human-origin-ufo-1850507322) from former Navy pilots who reported witnessing inexplicable aerial phenomena. No evidence of alien technology, maintains Pentagon Despite the explosive testimonies, an [official Pentagon report](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4519306-pentagon-ufo-report-key-takeaways/) released earlier this year offers a stark (if somewhat prescient) rebuttal to these claims. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) published a report stating that there is [no evidence of alien material](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/aliens-never-visited-the-us-says-a-report-from-the-pentagon) or reverse-engineered UAP technology within U.S. government programs. Instead, the report attributed public fascination with UAPs to pop culture, general distrust of federal institutions, and misinterpretations of conventional technology. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES The AARO report, titled [The Historical Record Report](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/08/2003409233/-1/-1/0/DOPSR-CLEARED-508-COMPLIANT-HRRV1-08-MAR-2024-FINAL.PDF), thoroughly reviewed past U.S. government investigations into UAPs, concluding that no programs have uncovered alien life or technology. The findings continue to divide opinions, with skeptics citing the AARO report and others questioning whether the Pentagon is fully transparent on the matter. As lawmakers continue to push for clarity, the hearing has raised more questions than answers regarding [UAP secrecy](https://interestingengineering.com/science/the-pentagons-ufo-office-reveals-new-gremlin-surveillance-system), technological arms races, and the need for public access to classified information on UAPs.

    "text": "Education\nDU’s Decision to Drop Papers on Islam, Pakistan, China Triggers Backlash\nDU’s panel decision to drop questions related to Islam, Pakistan, and China from PG Political Science papers has sparked row. While some members appreciated the move, others called it ‘ideological censorship’. Know details here.\nDU’s Decision to Drop Papers on Islam, Pakistan, China Triggers Backlash\nRecently,\nDelhi University's panel decided to drop alleged postgraduatePolitical Sciencepapers onIslam,Pakistan, andChina. The idea was not welcomed by numerous members. Some criticised it, saying it reflected ideological censorship, while others supported the move, labelling it a step towards making the syllabus \"India-centric and bias-free.\"In its meeting on Wednesday, DU's Standing Committee for Academic Matters instructed the removal of four elective papers — Islam and International Relations, Pakistan and the World, China's Role in the Contemporary World, and State and Society in Pakistan. A fifth paper, Religious Nationalism and Political Violence, is yet to be examined in the next meeting on July 1.\nContradicting the decision, committee member Professor Monami Sinha said such revisions undermine critical thinking and reflect a push to dilute controversial but academically relevant content.\n\"We argued that it is imperative to study Pakistan and China in detail. Ignoring these geopolitical realities would be academically short-sighted,\" she said in a statement.\nShe also raised concerns regarding the removal of references to caste, communal violence, and same-sex relationships in the revised syllabi for Sociology and Geography.\nHowever, Professor Harendra Tiwari, also a member of the committee, supported the changes, calling the syllabus \"agenda-driven\" and lacking in balance.\n\"Why only a paper on Islam and International Relations? Why not on Hinduism or Sikhism? We want a syllabus that serves students and our nation,\" he told PTI.\nAdditionally, he said that the dropped papers will not be restored unless the revised syllabus aligns with an \"India-first\" perspective.\nThe next committee meeting on July 1 is likely to see further debate on the syllabus.\n(With Inputs from PTI)\nDeepali Samaniya author\nDeepali Samaniya is a versatile journalist and content writer with a passion for SEO and a knack for crafting engaging stories.

It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nA spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",
