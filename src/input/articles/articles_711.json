    "text": "Pope Francis Lambasts the Scourge of Human Trafficking The Holy Father pointed out that trafficking is 'a ‘business’ that disrespects and disregards human dignity, delivering large profits to people without moral scruples.' Pope Francis today urged the abolition of human trafficking, “one of the most terrible scourges of our time” that disrespects and disregards human dignity and delivers “large profits to people without moral scruples.” The Holy Father denounced the practice in his message addressed to the participants of the general assembly of Talitha Kum, the organization formed by survivors actively engaged in the fight against human trafficking. For Pope Francis, trafficking is a “systemic” evil and as such “we can and must eliminate it through a systematic, multilevel approach.” “Trafficking is reinforced by wars and conflicts,” the pontiff said, “benefits from the effects of climate change and socioeconomic disparities, and takes advantage of the vulnerability of people forced to migrate or the conditions of inequality in which they find themselves, especially women and girls.” The Holy Father pointed out that trafficking is “a ‘business’ that disrespects and disregards human dignity, delivering large profits to people without moral scruples.” “Trafficking is constantly evolving and always finding new ways to develop, as it did during the pandemic,” he noted. However, the Pope urged participants “to not be discouraged” because “with the power of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the dedication of so many, we can succeed in eliminating it.” To accomplish this, Pope Francis stressed the importance of following the steps taken by Talitha Kum: “Stand by the victims, listen to them, help them get back on their feet and together take action against trafficking.” “To be truly effective against this odious criminal phenomenon, we need to be a community,” he said. The Pope also pointed out this is not an easy task, but it can be done, and thanked the organization for its work that has become “a reference point for victims, their families, those at risk, and the most vulnerable communities.” Finally, Pope Francis encouraged Talitha Kum members to “continue on this path, furthering prevention and care, and weaving together many valuable relationships that are indispensable in order to combat and defeat trafficking.” - Keywords: ['pope francis](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/pope-francis)",

La France s’oppose à ce que le Liban \"devienne un nouveau Gaza\" a déclaré jeudi le président Emmanuel Macron, évoquant le nombre \"absolument choquant\" de victimes civiles, lors d’un voyage au Canada. \"Israël doit cesser ses frappes et le Hezbollah sortir de sa logique de représailles\", a-t-il ajouté à Montréal lors d’une conférence de presse conjointe avec le Premier ministre canadien Justin Trudeau. Israël poursuit les attaques massives Israël a poursuivi ce jeudi 26 septembre pour la quatrième journée consécutive ses frappes aériennes massives sur l’est et le sud du Liban, promettant de combattre le Hezbollah \"jusqu’à la victoire\". Les bombardements, qui ont fait plus de 600 morts depuis lundi, dont de nombreux civils, ont jeté plus de 90 000 personnes sur les routes au Liban, selon l’ONU. Plus de 22 000 d’entre elles sont entrées en Syrie, ont indiqué des sources de sécurité dans ce pays. Face à cette escalade qui menace d’entraîner le Proche-Orient dans la guerre, la France et les États-Unis, rejoints par des pays arabes, occidentaux et européens, ont appelé mercredi à un \"cessez-le-feu immédiat de 21 jours \" pour \" donner une chance à la diplomatie \".",

    "title": "The Role of Employee Training in Preventing Business Theft",
    "text": "Featured image by\njefftakespics2\nIn the landscape of modern business, theft extends beyond the physical, encompassing technology, equipment, and even intellectual property. It’s a challenge that necessitates a vigilant and well-informed workforce.\nEquipping employees with the right knowledge and skills not only protects a business against various theft risks but also cultivates an environment of proactive security. As theft tactics overall become more sophisticated, the role of employee training in safeguarding a company’s diverse assets becomes increasingly vital.\nUnderstanding Business Theft: A Broad Perspective\nBusiness theft is an all-encompassing term that spans from the swiping of office supplies to the sophisticated cyber theft of sensitive data. It’s not just about the immediate loss of physical items. It is also about the ramifications that can ripple through a business, affecting everything from morale to the bottom line.\nRecognizing the varied faces of business theft is the first step in crafting an effective defense strategy. This understanding is crucial in training employees to identify and prevent potential thefts, thus making them an integral part of the company’s security apparatus.\nTheft of Technology: Guarding Digital Business Assets\nIn the digital age, technology theft has emerged as a major concern for almost every business. From laptops to proprietary software, the spectrum of technological assets vulnerable to theft is broad. Therefore, training employees to secure these digital assets goes beyond simple password protection. It involves instilling a culture of overall cybersecurity awareness.\nRELATED ARTICLE:\nTAKE STEPS TO PROTECT YOUR BUSINESS FROM CYBERCRIME\nWhether it’s recognizing phishing attempts or following strict data access protocols, employees’ vigilance plays a critical role. As technology becomes increasingly integral to business operations, equipping staff with the knowledge to protect digital assets is not just a precaution. It’s a necessity for safeguarding the heart of modern business.\nRELATED ARTICLE:\nWHAT IS AN HTML SMUGGLING ATTACK?\nSecuring Physical Equipment: From Office Supplies to Machinery\nSecuring physical equipment, from office essentials to large machinery, is a fundamental aspect of security for your business. The risk posed by theft of these items can significantly disrupt business operations. Beyond basic measures like locking doors, effective employee training should foster a collective sense of responsibility and heightened awareness. Employees need to be adept at recognizing suspicious activities as well as fluent in reporting procedures.\nRegular audits and explicit guidelines on equipment usage and storage are also crucial. Involving staff in safeguarding physical assets not only enhances security but also cultivates a more conscientious workplace. This is crucial for the protection of a business’s tangible investments.\nFuel Theft: A Growing Concern for Businesses\nIn the face of rising fuel prices and its increasing value, businesses are recognizing the importance of\npreventing fuel theft. Training employees in vigilant monitoring of fuel storage and awareness of theft indicators is essential. Discussing the benefits of steel bunded tanks, which offer robust security with their dual-layered structure, forms a key part of this training.\nEqually important is familiarizing staff with fuel management systems that can track consumption and signal any unusual activity. By integrating these strategies, employees become proactive in protecting this essential asset, thus fortifying the business against potential fuel theft.\nPreventing Intellectual Property Theft: Safeguarding Business Ideas\nIntellectual property theft, often overlooked, can be as damaging as the theft of physical assets. It involves the unauthorized use of ideas, inventions, or creative expressions, which are the lifeblood of many businesses. Training employees about the importance of IP rights, proper handling of sensitive information, and adherence to non-disclosure agreements is crucial.\nBy instilling a culture that respects and protects intellectual property, businesses not only secure their innovative ideas but also foster an environment of trust and integrity. This approach ensures that the intellectual assets, the drivers of growth and competitive advantage, are well-guarded.\nEnhancing Business Security with Effective Monitoring Systems\nUtilizing modern monitoring systems like CCTV and resource management tools is key to enhancing business security.\nCCTV cameras work to significantly prevent crime, providing continuous visual monitoring, acting as a deterrent to theft and recording evidence if an incident occurs.\nResource management systems help track the use and inventory of assets, quickly identifying any unusual patterns that might suggest theft. These systems are straightforward yet powerful tools in a business’s security strategy. They offer an extra layer of protection, helping businesses keep a closer eye on their assets and respond quickly to any security threats.\nWant to stay on top of ways to keep your business safe from theft and other security threats?

    "title": "Our House celebrates $16 million expansion",
    "text": "Our House celebrates $16 million expansion Our House, a Little Rock-based housing assistance nonprofit, celebrated the completion of a $16 million expansion project Wednesday morning. The project opens up new facilities that Our House says will double the amount of care they can provide for the unhoused community in Central Arkansas. Our House Executive Director Ben Goodwin says the community was key to making the expansion a reality. “They’ve bought into this vision and the need to serve more people, and the vision that we can serve them in a way that changes their lives for the better,” he said. During the ceremony, board members announced they have already started planning the next phase of expansion, which will provide additional housing for people in need. Goodwin was surprised to learn that this next housing project will be named in his honor. “I have not processed my feelings about that yet… I’m so grateful to have the opportunity to steward this organization that means so much to so many people in the community.” Woodley Choar and his two children are the first family to take advantage of the expanded housing. He says that Our House is unlike any other assistance program he has worked with, thanks to the wrap-around model of support. “I’m a single father with three kids, and as a single farmer, there’s not that much help out there. That’s why I say Our House has helped me and the kids so much. It’s not just me, that’s the offer that they give. They’re doing it straight from the heart,” he said. Our House says the 27,000-square-foot expansion will double the nonprofit’s housing capacity for families, as well as the number of children served in early-childhood and out-of-school programs. The expansion will also provide a dedicated space for on-site mental and physical healthcare.",

    "text": "New York, Feb 24 : A top Hindu advocacy group in the US has said that it is \"shocking\" and \"disheartening\" to see that the investigation into the killing of Indian student Jaahnavi Kandula is dismissed with no charges against those who struck her. Kandula, a student of the Northeastern University in South Lake Union, died after she was hit by a Seattle Police vehicle driven by officer Kevin Dave at a pedestrian crossing on the night of January 23 last year. Authorities in the U.S. ruled on Wednesday that Dave will not face any criminal charges due to the lack of \"sufficient\" evidence. Hindu advocacy group, Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) said on Friday (local time) that it is \"doubly shocking that such serious violations of civil rights of Hindus of different backgrounds and ages do not even merit any restorative justice.\" \"It is shocking and disheartening to see the investigation into the killing of #JaahnaviKandula be dismissed with no charges against those who struck her. Where is #justice for the family of this young international student, run over in a #Seattle sidewalk by a police car?\" CoHNA said in a post on X. The group said that they are reminded of the \"infamous\" 2015 case of Sureshbhai Patel, who faced police brutality that left him paralysed. Patel, then 57, was out for a walk in a neighborhood in Alabama when a 27-year-old police officer, Eric Parker, searched him for weapons. He then took the Indian national to the ground which resulted in serious spinal cord injury and paralysis. CoHNA said that charges against Parker were similarly dismissed due to 'lack of sufficient evidence'. The King County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on Wednesday that they will not be moving ahead with the trial against Seattle Police Officer Dave, and no criminal charges will be pressed against him. Kandula was thrown 100 feet when she was struck by the speeding police patrol vehicle, and died on the spot.",
