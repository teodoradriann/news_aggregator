    "text": "Feature Film Seeks Hudson Valley's Largest Church from wpdh.com As a journalist, I always find myself curious about unique architecture and design. Recently, I stumbled upon the Catholic Church in Hudson Ohio and was amazed by its beauty and intricate details. I decided to take a closer look and explore the hidden gems of this architectural masterpiece.\nLocated in the heart of Hudson, Ohio, the Catholic Church stands tall and proud with its Romanesque Revival style architecture. The exterior of the building is made of ashlar sandstone, giving it a unique texture and color. The grand entrance is adorned with a beautifully carved archway and a rose window that depicts the Holy Spirit in stunning detail. As I walked through the entrance, I was welcomed by a spacious vestibule that leads to the main nave of the church.\nTable of Contents\nThe Nave The Sacristy The Bell Tower The Baptismal Font The Nave The nave of the church is the central area where the congregation gathers for worship. The interior of the nave is breathtaking, with its high arches, intricate stained-glass windows, and a beautiful altar at the end. The nave is designed in a classic cross shape, symbolizing the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The stained-glass windows depict various biblical scenes and saints, adding to the spiritual ambiance of the church. The altar is the centerpiece of the nave, made of marble and adorned with beautiful carvings and statues. The altar is surrounded by a choir loft, where the choir sings during the mass.\nThe Sacristy The sacristy is a room where the clergy prepares for the mass and stores the vestments, vessels, and other liturgical items. The sacristy in the Catholic Church in Hudson Ohio is a hidden gem that not many people know about. The room is small but exquisitely designed, with intricate woodwork and beautiful stained-glass windows. The walls are adorned with paintings of various saints, adding to the spiritual ambiance of the room. The sacristy is connected to the sanctuary through a small door, allowing the clergy to enter and exit the altar with ease.\nThe Bell Tower The bell tower is one of the most prominent features of the Catholic Church in Hudson Ohio. The tower stands tall and proud, with its elegant design and beautiful carvings. The tower is made of limestone and has a clock face on each side. The tower houses the church’s bell, which weighs over 2,000 pounds and is rung during the mass and other religious ceremonies. The bell tower is accessible through a small door, and visitors can climb to the top for a stunning view of the town.\nThe Baptismal Font The baptismal font is a sacred vessel used for baptism, one of the sacraments of the Catholic Church. The baptismal font in the Catholic Church in Hudson Ohio is a beautiful piece of art, made of marble and adorned with intricate carvings and statues. The font is located in the vestibule of the church, near the entrance. The font is filled with holy water, which is used to baptize infants and adults into the Catholic faith.\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church in Hudson Ohio is a hidden gem that deserves recognition for its beautiful architecture and design. The church is not only a place of worship but also a work of art that tells a story of faith and devotion. The church’s nave, sacristy, bell tower, and baptismal font are just some of the many features that make it a unique and special place. I encourage everyone to visit and experience the beauty of the Catholic Church in Hudson Ohio.\nFeature Description Exterior Ashlar sandstone, grand entrance, rose window Nave High arches, stained-glass windows, altar, choir loft Sacristy Intricate woodwork, stained-glass windows, paintings of saints Bell Tower Limestone, clock faces, bell, stunning view Baptismal Font Marble, intricate carvings and statues, holy water\nSource: www3.nd.edu Source: www.dioceseofcleveland.org Source: www.hudson.oh.us Source: www.henningers.com Source: hudsonheritage.org Source: www.hudsonchristianchurch.com Source: patch.com Source: commentator.hawkweb.org Source: www.dioceseofcleveland.org Source: www.ar15.com Source: hudsonfcc.org Source: www.joinmychurch.com Source: wpdh.com",

    "title": "Former US State Department Official Says 30-Day Deadline for Israel To Let More Aid Into Gaza Is a PR Ploy",
    "text": "A former Arabic language spokeswoman for the State Department, who resigned over US support for the genocidal slaughter in Gaza, said in an interview that aired Wednesday that the Biden administration’s warning to Israel to allow more aid into Gaza within 30 days was nothing more than a pre-election public relations stunt.\n“I can tell you, as someone that worked within the State Department PR machine, that this, unfortunately, is a public relations ploy. I am sad to say it, but it’s the truth. It is conveniently 30 days, marking the time after the election,” Hala Rharrit told Democracy Now. “Also, it was conveniently leaked. It’s not typical for a statement like this to be leaked to the press, but it was.”\nThe Biden administration sent the letter to Israeli officials on October 14 and suggested that if the demands aren’t met, US military aid could be affected. However, the letter didn’t explicitly threaten to cut off weapons shipments, and the State Department also declined to say if there would be any consequences for Israel.\n“The reality is that the State Department and the administration at this point is trying to give voters, especially those that are so concerned about the conflict in Gaza, some level of hope: ‘As long as you vote for us, after this 30 days, we’ll enforce the law, and we will make a change.’ This is absolutely a deception for the voters and for the American people,” Rharrit said.\nRharrit said the US was violating multiple foreign assistance laws by providing military aid to Israel. “The reality is that we, as the United States government, are in violation of US law, of multiple of laws that your viewers can Google for themselves: the Leahy Law, the Foreign Assistance Act, the Arms Export Control Act. We continue to willfully violate laws so that we surge US military assistance to Israel,” she said.\nDiscussing State Department spokesman Matt Miller, Rharrit called him a liar. “As to Matthew Miller, I’m going to be unequivocal: He’s lying. And I know, I realize it’s quite a forceful thing for me to say, but as a former diplomat, I can assure that,” she said.\nRharrit pointed to the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been the obstacle to a ceasefire deal, while the State Department has always blamed Hamas. “There have been ceasefire deals that Hamas has agreed to. I am not one to advocate for the terrorist organization whatsoever, and I want to be clear about that. But facts are facts. Hamas has repeatedly agreed to ceasefire deals. It is Benjamin Netanyahu who has reneged on those deals,” she said.\nRharrit resigned from her post in the State Department back in April. She was a career diplomat, first entering the foreign service in 2006. She is one of 13 officials from US government agencies who have publicly resigned over President Biden’s full-throated support for the slaughter in Gaza.",

    "text": "Amy Duggar King hopes that her cousin Josh Duggar, who is behind bars for receiving and possessing child sexual abuse materials, is suffering for his actions.\n“I hope every day there is absolute torture for him,” the “19 Kids and Counting” and “Marriage Boot Camp” alum said in this week’s issue of People . “I really hope that because what he watched and what he was viewing for his own fulfillment is those kids experiencing torture.”\nBooks\nJinger Duggar says family’s ‘cult-like’ beliefs had her ‘terrified of the outside world’ TLC reality star Jinger Duggar speaks candidly about her family’s adherence to ‘harmful,’ ‘cult-like’ beliefs in her new book, ‘Becoming Free Indeed.’\nJan. 19, 2023\nJosh Duggar, 36, was convicted and sentenced to 12½ years in prison in May 2022 and is locked up at FCI Seagoville federal prison in Texas. He is expected to stay imprisoned until October 2032 after his appeal was denied in October .\nAdvertisement “He deserves every second in there, and I hope he gets a longer term. I hope he messes up again,” his cousin told the magazine.\nThe disgraced reality TV star and his ultra-religious family starred in TLC’s hit “19 Kids and Counting,” which was canceled in 2015 after allegations surfaced that he had, as a teen, molested four of his younger sisters, including Jill Duggar Dillard and Jessa Duggar Seewald . The eldest son of Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar also built a large family of his own — he had seven children with his wife, Anna Duggar — but admitted using extramarital-affair website Ashley Madison and checked himself into rehab in 2015, reportedly for a pornography addiction.\nThe family’s follow-up show, “Counting On,” was canceled in 2021 , months after Josh Duggar was arrested on child pornography charges.\nTelevision\nJinger Duggar isn’t in the documentary series about her family. Here’s why Jinger Duggar of TLC’s ’19 Kids and Counting’ explains why she declined to participate in ‘Shiny Happy People,’ a documentary series about her family.\nJune 7, 2023\nDespite Duggar’s conviction, his lawyer has maintained his client’s innocence, arguing that the illicit images that were downloaded on a computer at a car dealership owned by Duggar could have been downloaded by someone else.\nIn 2023, Amazon Studios’ four-part docuseries “ Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets ” dove into how the family’s Christian fundamentalist religion, associated with the Institute in Basic Life Principles (founded by disgraced minister Bill Gothard), was a breeding ground for abusive behavior toward women and children.\nThe series included interviews with several members of the family, including Jill Duggar Dillard and Amy Duggar King, the only daughter of Jim Bob Duggar’s older sister, Deanna Jordan. She did not grow up in the IBLP and had a less restrictive childhood than her cousins.\nAdvertisement\nTelevision\nWhat ‘Shiny Happy People’ reveals about the Duggars: ‘We were taken advantage of’ ‘Shiny Happy People’ dives into the fall of the Duggars, stars of TLC’s ’19 Kids and Counting’ and its spinoff. Here are six revelations from the series.\nMay 30, 2023\nAmy Duggar King, 37, said she doesn’t know if Josh Duggar is “doing any work” on himself during his time in prison. However, she also said that she has not spoken to him.\n“And I will not. I will not,” she told People. “When you just cross those evil lines like that, there is no coming back. I just think there’s no coming back.”\nMore to Read\nJill Duggar Dillard reveals her first daughter was stillborn: Child was ‘much loved’ April 15, 2024\nDiddy returns to Instagram, amid federal probe, to celebrate Easter with youngest daughter April 1, 2024\nJosh Peck speaks out after documentary details Drake Bell’s abuse by TV coach March 21, 2024\nTelevision Entertainment & Arts",
