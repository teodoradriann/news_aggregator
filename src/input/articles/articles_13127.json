    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "The Boulder Police and Fire Communications Center’s training program has been certified by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, the largest organization for public safety communication professionals, according to Boulder police spokeswoman Dionne Waugh. According to a Boulder news release, the certification ensures that an agency’s curriculum, training materials and supporting documentation are reviewed and checked for compliance. In the release, Dispatch Manager Brad Riggin said Colorado currently doesn’t have any training standards for 911 dispatchers, which was part of the reason the communications center worked for certification. “This certification ensures we are meeting APCO training standards and if the State of Colorado moves towards required training standards for 911 dispatchers, our center will likely already meet or exceed them,” Riggin said in the release. The certification status required Dispatch Supervisor Courtney Simmer to ensure the center’s training program met almost 200 required standards. The center will be required to re-certify every three years. “This validation serves as an expression of what we’ve known for a long time,” Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said in the release.",

Log in here »\nParts of British Columbia will likely enter “unfamiliar territory” with drought if they see another hot, dry summer, says the head of the province’s River Forecast Centre.\nDave Campbell says persistent drought conditions in B.C. stretch back to 2022, so the province is heading into this summer with “multi-year” precipitation deficits.\nSatellite photos show rivers in the Interior running narrower and shallower than the same time in 2023, which went on to be one of B.C.’s driest years on record.\nSide-by-side handout images, shown in infrared, taken by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite show the Quesnel River as it meets the Fraser River in Quesnel, B.C., in May 2023, left, compared with May 2024.THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO, European Union, Canadian Space Agency *MANDATORY CREDIT* With the average snowpack level lower than ever recorded in B.C., Campbell says he’s expecting cumulative effects that could include water scarcity.\n“We know these antecedent conditions that we’re coming into this year are much more challenging than we started out last year with,” he said in a recent interview.\n“The concern obviously is if we get that hot, prolonged dry (period) that we’ve seen last year and the year before as well. If that continues this summer, then really we are on a path toward things that we haven’t seen in recent memory.”\nB.C. officials held a news conference on Thursday to announce several new measures to help people prepare for threats such as drought and wildfires, which include an online tool for household emergency planning, an updated drought information portal and upgrades to the BC Wildfire Service mobile app.\nNathan Cullen, minister of water, land and resource stewardship, said the province is facing a “serious” situation with the potential for continued drought, and he asked people to take steps to reduce their consumption to conserve water.\n“Every drop counts,” he said.\nEmergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma said people often underestimate how their individual consumption adds up. During the peak summer months, residents of Metro Vancouver consume between 1.5 and 1.8 billion litres of water each day.\n“This is an extremely challenging amount to envision,” she said.\nMa said she recognizes there may be questions about large industrial users, but “nobody gets a free pass on this.”\n“Those companies, those industries, they are regulated, and they will be affected, if necessary, as well.\n“But we as individuals, as households, we have a role to play,” she said.\nThe province also released its latest snowpack bulletin on Thursday, which says levels are “extremely low,” averaging 66 per cent of normal for this time of year.\nThe bulletin says many low- to mid-elevation areas in the Interior are now free of snow.\nMuch of B.C. saw below-normal precipitation levels in April, the bulletin says, with some smaller pockets recording near-normal amounts.\nThe next three days are expected to bring temperatures that are “well-above normal,” leading to the first episode of rapid melting at higher elevations, it says.\nParts of the Interior are especially dry. Campbell said he’s most worried about the effects of drought on smaller rivers and creeks in the central Interior.\n“Prince George, Quesnel, Williams Lake, Vanderhoof, that’s kind of the hot spot, and then the other (area) that would be a concern would be up in the northeast,” he said.\nThe Vanderhoof area, west of Prince George, has seen about 220 millimetres of rain over the past year when it typically sees more than double that, he said.\nImages provided by the Canadian Space Agency appear to show the effects of persistent drought in the Interior when compared with those taken last spring.\nAn image taken last week by aEuropean Space Agency satellite shows the Quesnel River is narrower, with more of its banks exposed compared with an image taken a year ago. The latest photo shows patches of exposed riverbed and sandbars, indicating lower water levels in the tributary as it meets the upper Fraser River in Quesnel, about 600 kilometres north of Vancouver.\nSatellite images tell a similar story in Fort St. James, B.C., where the water appears shallower this year as Stuart Lake feeds into Stuart River.\nThe Fort Nelson and Muskwa rivers also appear narrower, with more of their banks exposed compared with images taken in April 2023.\nThe Canadian Space Agency notes the images use infrared “false colour” because it shows the boundaries between land and water more clearly than other renditions.\nCampbell said parts of B.C.’s Okanagan will likely also see the effects of the moisture deficit and low amounts of snow that melted early this spring.\nOn northern Vancouver Island, he said Port Hardy has seen 1,260 millimetres of rain over the last year when it typically sees a little more than 1,800 millimetres.\nIt would take “a few months of wet-season rainfall” to make up that deficit, he said.\nForests Minister Bruce Ralston told the news conference on Thursday that dry conditions and warm weather in the forecast will likely spur wildfire activity. He said officials are keeping a close eye on northeastern B.C. in particular.\nHe said the BC Wildfire Service had dispatched an incident management team to establish a command centre in the Fort Nelson area.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . “We’re preparing air and ground resources. Helicopters, air tankers, unit crews and initial attack crews are being brought in early,” he said.\nCliff Chapman, director of provincial operations for the BC Wildfire Service, said they’ve increased partnerships with First Nations and other local governments to use prescribed fire to help reduce the risks around communities this summer.\n“Twenty years ago, when I started my career in BC Wildfire Service, many of the fires that we fought did not interact with communities,” he added.\n“At this point in the life cycle of wildfires in British Columbia, almost every fire has an impact on somebody’s livelihood or it is adjacent to a community.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.\nAdvertisement Advertise With Us\nAdvertisement Advertise With Us\nTweet Share Print Email Read Later",

Siamo qui anche per chiedere il rispetto del lavoratori e delle lavoratrici che questo governo continua a calpestare. Il governo da quando si è insediato non ha dato altro che rendere il lavoro più precario. C’è in atto un attacco senza precedenti alla rappresentanza, c’è un attacco inserito nelle modifiche al codice degli appalti alla contrattazione collettiva che vuole normalizzare i contratti pirata.
