    "title": "‘It’s the most inhumane situation’: British-Palestinian doctor fights to get family out of Gaza",
    "text": "“Imagine phoning your parents, your brothers, sisters, and just wanting to hear they are still alive”, a tearful Dr Salim Ghayyda recalls as he fights to get his family out of the “inhumane” situation in Gaza.\nDr Ghayyda, 51, worries daily for the fate of his elderly parents, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews as they endure the grim conditions in a make-shift refugee camp in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.\nThe British-Palestinian, who has lived and worked in the UK for 21 years, has now launched an online fundraiser and is lobbying politicians to get his family to safety over the border.\nDr Ghayyda, who is a paediatric consultant at Raigmore Hospital, in Inverness, said that 31 members of his family are surviving with no running water and little food as raw sewage runs through the streets and they huddle for warmth in tents.\nHe said: “It’s the most inhumane, dangerous situation that a human being can find themselves in. All of my family’s homes are in the north of Gaza. So all of them had to evacuate due to the bombing and some of them were displaced and uprooted twice, or even three times.\nRaw sewage runs through the streets in the southern Gazan city of Rafah (Salim Ghayyda)\n“Then they’ve all ended up in Rafah, which is as you know the very small town near the Egyptian border. And their living conditions are just unfathomable really.\n“Rafah itself is very cold at night because its almost a desert area, its near the Sinai. It’s very cold at night. There is no running water whatsoever, so water is collected in buckets.”\nHe added: “Food was being grown in Gaza, such as fruits and vegetables, but conditions are very dangerous, so farmers can’t really cultivate the land. Even when my family find food, is it of the poorest ever quality.\nMembers of Dr Ghayyda’s family huddle for warmth in a tent (Salim Ghayyda)\n“They said to me, they would never have imagined buying the food they are buying at the moment, but there is no other alternative.”\nIsrael began its military campaign after the October 7 deadly incursion by Hamas. Since then Israel has launched a ferocious bombing campaign killing more than 25,000 people, mostly women and children.\nJust last week, UN judges said that Israel must ensure its forces do not commit genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\nDr Ghayyda’s family don’t have British citizenship so are not permitted to cross Rafah into Egypt, so his father Nabil, in his 80s, mother Dalal, in her 70s, are trapped along with his other family members.\nHe said: “There have been periods of agonising blackouts when suddenly Israel will just cut communication for a day or two or recently up to a week.\nDr Ghayyda’s father Nabil, in his 80s, is struggling to access medical services (Salim Ghayyda)\n“I would find myself in such a state that where somebody asks me how I feel and its like somebody has shattered my heart 100 times.\n“Of course I am worried about them all the time and every day, every hour, I check on them “are you still alive…are you still alive?”, I couldn’t sleep for weeks and weeks.”\nHe is desperate to get his family out of the region and wants more support from the government in assisting British citizens who have family trapped in Gaza.\nDr Ghayyda points to refugee schemes for Syrians and Ukrainians escaping conflict, but questions why there has not been a similar push for resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza.\nThere is no electricity, so any food the family can find it cooked using this small fire (Salim Ghayyda)\nHe said: “For some reason our families do not matter to the British government, almost as if we are ghosts, we are not seen.”\nDr Ghayyda, who was born in Gaza, said another difficult part of the conflict was watching the hospitals he trained and worked in as a young man now be hit by bombs, as his colleagues struggle to treat people.\nHe added: “I am tortured between me attempting to get them uprotted from their native lands, but also I can’t accept the fate if they stay they will be killed, if not from bombs then from starvation or diseases.\n“There is no day I don’t phone them when somebody is not sick…my dad has almost died twice because of a lack of medical care.”\nDr Ghayyda, has worked and lived in Scotland for the past 11 years, with his wife and three children. Coming to the UK in 2003, he previously spent time working at hospitals in England.\nHe has launched an fundraising appeal on GoFundMe to raise £100,000 to help his family cross the border safely into Egypt. So far just over £15,000 has been pledged.\nClick here to contribute to the GoFundMe\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "text": "Volodymyr Putin and Xi Jinping (Photo: Getty Images)\nChina and Russia have launched satellites designed for inspection and repair of other spacecraft but could be used for attacks on U.S. assets, reports the U.S. Space Force.\nIn their first public assessment of space threats, the U.S. Space Force reported that the dual-use nature of some spacecraft, such as the Chinese satellites Shijian-17 and Shijian-21, complicated the detection, attribution, or mitigation of anti-satellite testing or hostile activities.\nWhat is known about Chinese developments\nThe report mentions that Russia and China are developing and testing anti-satellite weapons to disrupt or destroy satellites and space services. China is also developing, and possibly close to deploying, ground-based lasers capable of damaging, not just temporarily blinding, U.S. satellite sensors.\n“They often mask or conceal these activities to avoid international condemnation,” the report titled “Competing in Space” states.\nWhat Russia is doing\nAccording to the report, China is developing satellite inspection and repair systems that can function as weapons and has launched several satellites to test orbital servicing and prevent debris formation.\nIn January 2022, the Chinese Shijian-21 maneuvered a defunct Chinese geostationary satellite into an orbit where it would not pose a threat to other spacecraft.\nIt is also highlighted that the Chinese Shijian-17 has a robotic arm for capturing other satellites, while Russia has deployed several prototypes of orbital anti-satellite weapons in low Earth orbit, including the Cosmos 2504, 2519, and 2536 models, to test kinetic kill capabilities.\nU.S. response\nChina likely develops jammers for a wide range of satellite communication supporting government and military operations, as its military exercises regularly involve the use of satellite communication jammers, space radars, and satellite navigation systems like GPS.\nTo counter these threats, the U.S. Space Force launched the first batch of the new early warning satellites, dubbed Silent Barker.\nIt is designed to track Chinese or Russian spacecraft that could potentially disable or damage U.S. orbital systems.\nRussian capabilities are limited\nAccording to the report, China currently employs over 300 remote sensing satellites with various sensors, enhancing the capability of the Chinese military to observe American aircraft carriers, expeditionary strike groups, and deployed aviation wings.\n“Although Russia operates some of the world’s most capable individual remote-sensing satellites, it has a limited number compared with the US and China,” stated the Space Forces.\nChina and Russia Cooperation\nEarlier, the White House stated that Russia, China, and North Korea, dissatisfied with the existing world order, were strengthening cooperation among themselves.\nMajor General Vadym Skibitskyi, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, mentioned that Russia imported most components for its weapons through China’s territory, including those produced by other countries. Additionally, Moscow sought to obtain Chinese munitions.\nRecently, Reuters reported that Russia had surpassed Saudi Arabia and become the largest supplier of crude oil to China in 2023. The world’s largest oil importer challenged Western sanctions and purchased significant volumes of oil at a discount for its refineries.",

    "text": "Yubari is well-known for its famous melon production, film festival and staggering depopulation. Once a mining town, the population has unfortunately decreased to just over six thousand people. Today, some parts of the city have been given over to rewilding, but there are still plenty of gems for visitors to explore.\nYubari King Melon\nHokkaido’s most famous fruit Image: PIXTA/ eps Of all the fruits in Hokkaido, no fruit is more highly esteemed than the Yubari King Melon. Grown in greenhouses, these melons are sought after for their sweet taste, fragrant aroma and tender texture. Harvest season happens throughout mid-May to August when top-grade melons can easily fetch several million yen at auction. In the summer months, Yubari Melon Terrace offers an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with trays full of chilled Yubari Melon. The JA Yubari City Melon Dome is also a great place to shop for fruity treats.\nYubari International Fantastic Film Festival\nA must-see for movie lovers Image: PIXTA/ HAPPY SMILE Since 1990, the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival has screened an eclectic mix of subtitled Japanese and international films. One fan of the festival is Hollywood film director Quentin Tarantino, who wrote part of the screenplay for \"Pulp Fiction\" in Yubari and later named a character in \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" after the town.\nAnother cinematic attraction is the Yellow Handkerchief Memorial Park, the shooting location for the final scene of the award-winning 1997 road-trip film \"The Yellow Handkerchief.\" Here, movie memorabilia, including the Mazda Familia, can be seen surrounded by yellow messages of happiness from visitors. The park is part of Yubari Cinema Street, a road where buildings are plastered with vintage posters for the films that once entertained the miners who worked in Yubari during its industrial heyday.\nHistory and Nature\nClick here to read more.",

    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese online retailer JD.com said on Friday that it won a lawsuit against rival Alibaba, which was fined 1 billion yuan ($140.68 million) for monopolistic practices. The High People’s Court of Beijing ruled that Alibaba Group Holding Limited along with Zhejiang Tmall Network Co and Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co had abused their market dominance and adopted monopolistic practices known as “choosing one from two” causing JD.com severe damage, JD.com said in a statement published on its official WeChat account. JD.com said it has nothing more to add beyond the statement. “This ruling is not only a fair decision for JD’s resistance against the ‘choose one out of two’ monopoly, but a landmark moment in upholding market fairness and competition order through the rule of law,” the statement said. “It will be a significant moment in China’s anti-monopoly legal process.” Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Alibaba was fined a record $2.75 billion in an anti-trust probe by Chinese regulators in 2021 which stated that it had abused its market dominance. The two e-commerce giants in China had criticised each other for a practice called choosing one out of two, citing brands and merchants who had reportedly been told that if they wanted to operate on their platform, they have to do so exclusively.

    "text": "Disability Advocates Fight Medicaid Cuts amidst Personal Sacrifices\nAcross The Nation, disability advocates are intensifying their battle against proposed Medicaid cuts, a move that threatens essential services and community living for millions. Latoya Maddox, a Philadelphia resident and a vocal member of American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today (ADAPT), exemplifies the challenges and sacrifices inherent in this fight.\nMedicaid Cuts Spark Protests and Arrests In May, Maddox and fellow activists protested during a House Energy and Commerce Committee meeting, chanting “No Cuts to Medicaid!” Their demonstration led to a forceful removal by Capitol Police, highlighting the escalating tensions surrounding healthcare funding. Maddox,who uses a power wheelchair,recounted the aggressive manner in which they were escorted out,emphasizing the physical risk advocates face.\nThe proposed $1.1 trillion in healthcare funding cuts and the introduction of Medicaid work requirements could strip nearly 12 million individuals of essential healthcare coverage. This has spurred disability advocacy groups to organize protests and “die-ins” in Capitol buildings, aiming to convince lawmakers to reject the legislation. Despite these efforts, the Senate recently passed a $4.5 trillion tax-cut bill that includes these significant Medicaid reductions.\nBalancing Activism with Family Care Maddox confronts the daunting task of balancing her activism with her responsibilities as a mother to a 13-year-old son. The potential for arrest and extended detention looms large,particularly given the limited availability of her son’s father. “I’m out here putting my life on the line, potentially not being able to come home, because I might get locked up for long periods of time,” Maddox stated, underscoring the personal costs of her advocacy.\nThe financial strain is also significant. Maddox, who lives in subsidized housing and dedicates most of her income to rent, worries about affording her son’s medications and her home care services if Medicaid is cut.She fears the cuts could increase her risk of institutionalization.\nThe Fight for Community Living ADAPT champions the right for disabled individuals to live in their communities, advocating for deinstitutionalization and opposing policies that force people into nursing homes or institutions.The organization believes individuals capable of community living should have the chance to do so, emphasizing the “dignity of risk.”\nPro Tip:\nAdvocacy groups stress that community living offers freedoms not available in institutional settings, such as unrestricted visitation, family gatherings, and personal autonomy. Furthermore, community-based services are often more cost-effective than institutional care.\nThe debate extends beyond mere survival; it encompasses quality of life, personal choice, and basic human rights. Advocates argue that cutting Medicaid not only endangers lives but also strips individuals of their dignity and independence.\nMedicaid Cuts: Potential Impacts The proposed Medicaid cuts could have far-reaching and devastating consequences for people with disabilities. Here’s a breakdown:\nImpact Area Potential Result Healthcare Access Loss of essential services, medications, and equipment. Community Living Increased risk of institutionalization due to lack of support services. Financial Stability Increased financial burden to cover healthcare costs out-of-pocket. Personal Autonomy Reduced independence and ability to make personal life choices. Did You No?\nA 2023 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicaid enrollees with disabilities are more likely to report unmet healthcare needs compared to those without disabilities, even with Medicaid coverage. Further cuts could exacerbate this disparity.\nLooking Ahead As the fight continues, advocates like Maddox remain committed to their cause, despite the personal sacrifices involved. They are determined to protect Medicaid funding and ensure that people with disabilities have the opportunity to live full, independent lives in their communities.\nWhat actions can individuals take to support disability advocacy and prevent these cuts? How can communities better support disabled individuals in leading independent lives?\nThe Historical Context of disability Rights Advocacy The fight for disability rights in the United States has deep roots, evolving from charity-based models to a demand for civil rights and inclusion. Landmark legislation, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, marked significant progress, but ongoing battles over healthcare, employment, and accessibility highlight the persistent need for advocacy.\nGroups like ADAPT have been at the forefront of this movement, employing direct action and civil disobedience to challenge systemic barriers and promote the rights of people with disabilities. Their work underscores the importance of community organizing and political activism in achieving social change.\nfrequently Asked Questions About Medicaid and Disability Rights\nWhy Are Medicaid Cuts A Significant Concern For People With disabilities?\nMedicaid provides essential funding for healthcare services,home care,and equipment that many disabled individuals rely on for daily living and independence. Cuts to Medicaid could result in loss of access to these critical resources. what is Community Living, And Why is It Important?\nCommunity living refers to the opportunity for disabled individuals to live in their own homes and participate fully in community life, rather than being confined to institutions. It promotes independence, dignity, and social inclusion. What Is The “Dignity Of Risk” In The Context Of Disability Rights?\nThe “dignity of risk” acknowledges that disabled individuals have the right to make their own choices, even if those choices involve some level of risk. It supports autonomy and self-determination. How Can Individuals Support Disability Advocacy Efforts?\nIndividuals can support disability advocacy by contacting their elected officials, participating in protests and rallies, donating to disability rights organizations, and raising awareness about disability issues in their communities. What Are Medicaid Work Requirements, And Why Are They Controversial?\nMedicaid work requirements mandate that recipients must work or participate in job training to maintain their eligibility for benefits. They are controversial because they can create barriers to healthcare for disabled individuals and others who face challenges in finding or maintaining employment.

What are your thoughts on the proposed Medicaid cuts?\nbased on the provided article and web\nDisability Rights Activist: Why She’s Protesting in 2025 – [Activist’s Name] Speaks Out In the year 2025, disability rights are still a crucial area of advocacy. [Activist’s name], a prominent figure in the disability rights movement, continues to protest. Her actions,like those of other disability advocates,are driven by a complex mix of issues,from systemic discrimination to the ongoing fight for equal access. This article provides compelling reasons behind her activism, delving into the key challenges and demands driving her protest.\nThe Core Issues Driving the Protest Several core issues underpin [Activist’s Name]’s decision to protest in 2025. These challenges highlight the need for legislative changes, community uplift, and corporate social obligation. Addressing each demand of the disability rights movement is important.\nAccessibility Challenges in the Digital Age and the Digital Divide Even as technology advances, ensuring digital accessibility remains a significant hurdle.Many websites, apps, and online platforms are not adequately designed to meet the needs of people with disabilities. This digital divide creates significant barriers to data, education, employment, and social participation. The push for digital accessibility standards, such as following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), is a significant focus.\nLack of proper alt-text for images Poor color contrast Non-keyboard navigatable content Affordable Housing and Autonomous Living securing and maintaining affordable and accessible housing is another critical issue. The demand is high. Independent living centers provide essential services, but funding remains a consistent challenge. Lack of available housing is only one problem. Accessibility issues compound this problem.\nRamp access Wider doorways Accessible bathrooms Employment Discrimination and Fair Wages Employment opportunities for people with disabilities, though improving, still present significant challenges. Discrimination in hiring practices, lack of workplace accommodations, and inadequate support services limit career prospects. Fair wages, equal opportunities, and inclusive workplaces are essential demands. This includes increasing awareness among employers regarding reasonable accommodations.\nBias in interviews Lack of support for workplace accommodations. Healthcare Access and affordability Access to quality, affordable healthcare is a universal concern, but it’s especially critical for individuals with disabilities. This encompasses coverage for assistive devices, access to specialized medical care, and ensuring that healthcare facilities are fully accessible. The debate around healthcare reform often includes vital discussions and support for people with disabilities.\nLack of insurance coverage. Inaccessible medical facilities What [Activist Name] Is Demanding [Activist Name] focuses the protests on specific demands designed to achieve concrete progress. Some of these key areas include:\npolicy and Legislative Reform The passage and enforcement of laws that protect the rights of people with disabilities are top priorities. This includes advocating for strengthened and enforceable accessibility guidelines. Efforts go towards lobbying for legislation.\nIncreased Funding for Support Services [activist’s Name] and others request a reallocation of funds to organizations and programs that offer crucial support. This could include independent living centers, mental health services (LSI Keyword: mental health resources for people with disabilities), and vocational training programs. Funding is essential, but how it’s allocated and used is just as important.\nPublic Awareness Campaigns Changing societal attitudes requires raising awareness and educating the public. She emphasizes initiatives to promote understanding and empathy toward individuals with disabilities. Increasing public awareness and empathy can improve public acceptance. These campaigns include workshops, media outreach, and community events.\nHow to Support the Movement in 2025 Getting involved dose not require direct participation in protests. Many ways to help are available. Here are different ways of supporting disability rights advocacy.\nAdvocate for specific bills that support the rights of the disabled. Support them to get passed. Educate yourself and others. It increases empathy and understanding of disability issues and how their rights are at risk. Provide financial support to organizations that actively take part in this advocacy.",

    "title": "Emerging Cyber Threat to Your Ad Spend: AI Media Deception 01/09/2025",
    "text": "by Jordan Mitchell , Op-Ed Contributor, Yesterday\nCybercriminals have evolved beyond stealing credit card numbers and passwords. They're now weaponizing AI to compromise advertising ecosystems, creating a crisis that threatens not just your media budget, but the fundamental integrity of digital advertising metrics. This isn't about isolated incidents of brand spoofing anymore – we're facing sophisticated, AI-powered deception campaigns that can scale instantly and adapt in real-time.\nConsider this: Your carefully orchestrated campaign isn't just competing for attention anymore – it's competing against intelligent systems that can generate thousands of variations of your own brand messaging, each tailored to specific demographic segments. These AI systems analyze user data to deliver hyper-personalized deceptive content that becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from legitimate brand communications.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nThis challenge represents the next evolution of click fraud. While advertisers have long battled basic bot networks generating fake impressions, AI-powered deception takes this threat to an unprecedented level. These aren't simple automated scripts - they're sophisticated systems that can learn and adapt to your fraud detection measures in real-time.\nThe metrics you rely on – impressions, click-through rates, view completions – are becoming extremely vulnerable. While discussions often focus on detecting fake content, the real crisis lies in how AI manipulation impacts campaign performance. When you invest in programmatic campaigns, you're potentially competing against AI agents that can generate unlimited engagement while bypassing standard fraud detection mechanisms. This leads to wasted dollars and little to no tangible results.\nThe threat extends beyond traditional brand impersonation. We're witnessing the emergence of AI-generated avatars – not clones of real people, but entirely fabricated digital personas designed to build trust with specific audience segments. These avatars can be mass-produced with variations in appearance, voice and presentation style, all optimized to resonate with particular demographic targets. Imagine thousands of these AI personalities, each crafted to appeal to different audience segments, all pushing unauthorized or manipulated versions of your brand message.\nFor media buyers and planners, this requires immediate implementation of cybersecurity-first media practices:\nIntegrate AI-specific fraud detection into your media buying stack, similar to how organizations deploy intrusion detection systems. Standard viewability metrics are as outdated as simple firewalls in a world where AI can mimic human behavior patterns with increasing sophistication.\nDocument authentic engagement patterns before AI tools become prevalent in your sector. Think of this as creating a behavioral baseline – similar to how security teams establish network baselines to detect anomalies. This gives you a comparative framework to identify suspicious patterns in future campaigns.\nTreat media contracts like security agreements. Require publishers and platforms to verify their traffic authentication methods and maintain transparency about AI detection capabilities. Build AI authentication requirements into your media buying process from the start.\nIn 2025, we're likely to see AI tools that can generate and distribute unauthorized brand content at unprecedented scale and speed. Nation-state actors are already exploring ways to leverage these technologies for targeted misinformation campaigns. The challenge goes beyond brand safety – it's about ensuring your media dollars actually reach and influence real humans in an environment where AI can generate unlimited content and engagement.\nSmart media buyers are prioritizing comprehensive ad verification methods that go beyond basic metrics. This means implementing systems that not only confirm human viewability of ads, but also protect against sophisticated AI-powered fraud and ensure brand safety compliance. Early adopters of these enhanced verification protocols report more accurate campaign performance measurements and significantly reduced wasted ad spend in an increasingly AI-saturated landscape.\nThe solution extends beyond technology. Media literacy becomes crucial as AI-generated content floods our digital spaces. Just as organizations invest in cybersecurity training, they must now prioritize AI awareness and detection capabilities across their teams. This includes understanding the telltale signs of AI-generated content and implementing verification protocols for all digital assets.\nThis isn't just another tech trend to monitor – it's a fundamental shift in how we must approach media authentication and verification. In an era where AI can generate thousands of deep fake variations optimized for specific audience segments, verification becomes as crucial as the creative in your media strategy. Those who implement robust AI authentication measures now will be best positioned to protect their brand integrity and media investments in this new reality of digital advertising.",
