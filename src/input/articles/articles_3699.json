    "title": "'Out of nowhere': Storms leave thousands without power Thursday",
    "text": "KSHB 41 reporter Rachel Henderson covers issues in Wyandotte and Leavenworth counties. [Send Rachel a story idea](mailto:rachel.henderson@kshb.com). — Thousands of area residents are dealing with the [aftermath](https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/storm-damage-reported-around-kc-metro-overnight) of severe weather Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Evergy’s [outage map](https://outagemap.evergy.com/) Thursday evening showed about 1,000 active outages and under 11,000 total customers without power. That a big drop from more than 100,000 customers without power during and after the storm. From the front, you’d never guess Cindy Wilson’s property along West 101st street in KCMO saw any storm damage, but in the backyard, a large tree that snapped overnight fell directly onto power lines. “This was a perfectly healthy tree and we couldn’t find any reason to get rid of it,\" Wilson said. \"We just couldn’t do it and so this is what happened.\" She and her husband were in the living room of their home when the storm caught their attention Wednesday night. “All of a sudden, there was this huge ‘thump,’ and you could tell that something that really big came down outside,\" Wilson said. \"So it was just that quick.\" Kara Berger said she felt that same instantaneous feeling while she was at her husband’s softball game Wednesday night in Lawrence. “It truly came out of nowhere and went from zero to insanity very, very, very quickly,” said Berger said. “All of a sudden, I look over to my right and I see almost like a dust devil, like spurring up, and you just see all of it come at us from our right side.” Berger says everyone she was with ran as quickly as they could back to their cars, but running against the wind wasn’t easy. Still, she had time to shoot video. “I took time to capture it because it was such a surreal experience, and I’ve lived in Kansas my whole life and I’ve never, never had anything like that happen to where it truly seemed like it came out of nowhere,” Berger said. “The dirt and the dust and the little gravel didn’t feel great to get pelted with. It was an exfoliating treatment I didn’t realize I was going to get.” Berger says there wasn’t much damage other than debris left on her property she found once she made it home. Cartwright Tree Care crews have seen a wide range of damage since 4 a.m. Thursday. “The calls came before we even opened the doors, and our office opens at eight, so the calls have been coming and they’re all over the place from Harrisonville, Kansas City, Kansas to Blue Springs,” said Cheryl Cartwright, owner of Cartwright Tree Care. One of her crews made it to Wilson's home around 1:00 p.m. Cartwright says she didn’t expect this round of storms to be as severe as it was and she’s hoping both tree companies and homeowners alike can see some relief soon. “We’re all tired,” she said. “Homeowners are tired, tree companies are tired, like this has been going on since May.” Cartwright does have advice for homeowners. “We do the best we can from the ground, but having your trees trimmed on a regular basis does help them weather the storms,” Cartwright said. Wilson’s advice for homeowners like her is to look on the bright side. “We feel kind of lucky that, you know, there’s lines all over the place,” Wilson said. “They could have really done a whole lot more damage than it did, and it didn’t hit the house and we’re okay, so you know, these things happen when you own a home.”",

    "title": "Iranians mourn Guards’ commander killed in Israeli strike",
    "text": "TEHRAN: Thousands massed Thursday in the Iranian capital for the funeral of senior Revolutionary Guards commander Razi Moussavi, three days after he was killed in what Tehran says was an Israeli strike. The crowd in Tehran’s central Imam Hossein square chanted “Death to Israel” and “Death to America”. Many waved yellow flags imprinted with the message “I am your opponent” — a reference to Israel — in both Persian and Hebrew. Israel has long fought a shadow war of assassinations and sabotage against arch foe Iran and its allies, but Moussavi’s killing in Syria came at a time of sharply heightened regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas conflict since early October. Some of the mourners in Tehran carried pictures of Moussavi together with the revered Qasem Soleimani, a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s foreign operations arm who was killed in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad. Iran next week will mark the fourth anniversary of the death of Soleimani, who had run the IRGC’s Quds Force for more than a decade. Iranian state media says an Israeli missile strike on Monday near the Syrian capital Damascus killed Moussavi, a Quds Force general and the most senior Guards commander killed since Soleimani. The Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said only that it does not comment on foreign media reports.

    "title": "First time since 2019, Erdogan skips mention of Kashmir in UN speech | India News - The Indian Express",
    "text": "For the first time since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has not mentioned the issue of Kashmir in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly. This comes at a time when Turkey is making a bid to be a part of the BRICS grouping. “We maintain our will to develop our relations with BRICS, which brings together emerging economies,” he said during the course of his speech at the 79th UN General Assembly in New York. The founding members of BRICS – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – decided last year to expand the grouping. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and they became members from January 1, 2024. All members are expected to attend the BRICS leaders’ summit in Kazan, Russia, from October 22 to 24. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that he expected Erdogan to attend the BRICS summit in Russia next month, after Turkey requested to join the group of emerging economies. Putin said he was due to meet Erdogan on October 23. If admitted, Turkey would become the first NATO member in the group. For the last five years, Erdogan was the only head of state, apart from Pakistan’s, to have raised the issue of Kashmir at the UNGA. In September 2019, Erdogan had talked about the “dispute over Kashmir” and “to ensure a safe future for the people of Kashmir, together with their Pakistani and Indian neighbours, the dispute must be resolved through dialogue on the basis of justice and fairness, rather than conflict”. In his 2020 UNGA speech, he had said that “the Kashmir problem” which is also the key to the stability of the peace of South Asia, still awaits a solution, and Turkey is in favour of a resolution within the framework of the UN resolutions “in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir”. Speaking at the UNGA in 2021, Erdogan said Turkey maintains its stance in favour of solving the “ongoing problem in Kashmir” for 74 years, through “dialogue between the parties and within the framework of relevant United Nations resolutions”. In the 2022 speech, he had mentioned India, and said that he regrets that peace and cooperation between India and Pakistan has still not yet been established, despite 75 years following their independence. “We hope that a just and lasting peace, and tranquillity will be reached in Kashmir,” he had said, without mentioning the UN resolutions. Last year, in 2023, he had said that the establishment of a “just and lasting peace in Kashmir through dialogue and cooperation between India and Pakistan” will pave the way for regional serenity, stability and prosperity in South Asia, and Turkey will continue to support the steps to be taken in this direction. This was the second year when he had dropped the reference to the UN resolutions. Addressing the 79th session of the UNGA Tuesday, Erdogan said: “Not only children are dying in Gaza; the United Nations system is also dying, the truth is dying, the values that the west claims to defend are dying, the hopes of humanity to live in a fairer world are dying one by one. Recalling that the United Nations was established to maintain international peace and security after the Second World War, during which millions of people lost their lives, Erdogan said: “With the establishment of the United Nations, expectations for global stability, peace and justice blossomed again, and hopes for peace revived. However, we observe with regret that in recent years, the United Nations is struggling to fulfil its founding mission and is gradually turning into a dysfunctional, unwieldy and inert structure. We need the values represented by the maxim ‘The world is bigger than five’, more and more nowadays.” “We witness that international peace and security are too important to be left to the arbitrariness of the ‘privileged five’,” he said. “We are deepening our engagement with regional organisations, such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association, the Pacific Islands Forum and particularly ASEAN. We maintain our will to develop our relations with BRICS, which brings together emerging economies. We share a deep-rooted history with the Central Asian countries; we further strengthen our cooperation on bilateral and multilateral grounds,” Erdogan said. India is a member of both the Indian Ocean Rim Association and BRICS grouping.",

    "text": "Vídeos relacionados:\nLas ejecuciones en Estados Unidos han alcanzado su punto más alto en una década, y solo estamos en julio.\nCon la muerte de un recluso en Florida esta semana, ya suman 26 las ejecuciones llevadas a cabo en 2025, superando ampliamente las cifras de los últimos años y acercándose al récord reciente, de 28, correspondiente al año 2015.\nEste repunte marca un giro significativo en la tendencia nacional hacia la reducción del uso de la pena capital, en un momento en que el debate sobre su legitimidad, eficacia y carácter ético vuelve a ganar protagonismo, tanto en las cortes como en el discurso político nacional.\nFlorida, Texas y Carolina del Sur concentran más de la mitad\nSegún el último informe del Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), el incremento de las ejecuciones no es generalizado en todo el país, sino que está concentrado en unos pocos estados, siendo Florida, Texas y Carolina del Sur los principales responsables del aumento.\nFlorida, por ejemplo, ha ejecutado a ocho reclusos en lo que va de 2025, consolidándose como uno de los estados más activos en la aplicación de la pena capital.\nEste resurgimiento responde a políticas impulsadas por autoridades estatales que han adoptado posturas más agresivas en materia penal, desoyendo las tendencias abolicionistas observadas en otros territorios del país.\nLo más leído hoy:\nNuevos métodos de ejecución: Nitrógeno y fusilamiento\nEl panorama actual no solo está marcado por el aumento de casos, sino también por el retorno o adopción de métodos de ejecución poco habituales.\nDe las 26 ejecuciones registradas este año, 21 han sido por inyección letal, mientras que otras tres se han realizado mediante inhalación de nitrógeno, un método introducido en Alabama en 2024, considerado por expertos de la ONU como una forma de \"tortura\".\nAdemás, dos ejecuciones fueron por fusilamiento, un método que no se utilizaba en el país desde hace 15 años.\nEn marzo, Carolina del Sur ejecutó a Brad Sigmon, de 67 años, por este método.\nFue la primera vez en más de una década que un reo era fusilado en Estados Unidos, tras una decisión de la Corte Suprema estatal que validó este procedimiento ante la escasez de fármacos para la inyección letal.\nDurante la ejecución, el condenado fue atado a una silla, con una capucha y una marca sobre el corazón como blanco del pelotón.\nLa escena pudo ser presenciada por testigos desde una sala separada por un cristal antibalas.\nAdemás de Carolina del Sur, otros cuatro estados -Idaho, Utah, Mississippi y Oklahoma- contemplan legalmente el fusilamiento, aunque su aplicación ha sido extremadamente rara desde 1977.\nLa pena de muerte en un país dividido\nActualmente, la pena de muerte está abolida en 23 estados, mientras que otros tres -California, Oregón y Pensilvania- mantienen una moratoria sobre su aplicación.\nSin embargo, 27 estados conservan la pena capital como parte de su sistema judicial, aunque en 2024 solo nueve de ellos realizaron ejecuciones.\nEste contexto pone de manifiesto la profunda división nacional sobre la pena de muerte, tanto en el plano legal como en el social.\nAunque las encuestas muestran una caída sostenida en el apoyo popular a la pena capital, ciertos sectores políticos buscan revitalizar su uso como símbolo de mano dura contra el crimen.\nTrump promete endurecer la política penal\nEn este clima polarizado, el presidente Donald Trump prometió a finales del año pasado que impulsará una política firme de aplicación de la pena de muerte.\nAnunció que ordenará al Departamento de Justicia que solicite la pena capital en casos de delitos violentos, como asesinatos de ciudadanos o agentes del orden.\n“El próximo gobierno protegerá a las familias y a los niños estadounidenses de violadores violentos, asesinos y monstruos”, declaró Trump en su cuenta de Truth Social.\nAdemás, propuso aplicar la pena de muerte a inmigrantes que asesinen ciudadanos estadounidenses, declaraciones que han generado fuertes reacciones en sectores pro derechos humanos y legales.\nSu postura contrasta con la del actual presidente Joe Biden, quien mantuvo una moratoria federal sobre las ejecuciones y conmutó las sentencias de casi todos los reos condenados a muerte a nivel federalñ.\nNo lo hizo en tres casos: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (atentado en la maratón de Boston), Robert Bowers (ataque a una sinagoga) y Dylann Roof (masacre en una iglesia afroamericana de Charleston).\nEl peso de la historia y las heridas del pasado\nAlgunos de los ejecutados en los últimos años han compartido historias marcadas por el abandono institucional y el trauma, como en el caso del hombre ejecutado esta semana en Florida, quien formó parte de un grupo de reclusos que pasó su infancia en la Florida School of Boys, conocida también como Dozier School, una institución tristemente célebre por el maltrato y la violencia sistémica.\nEl centro fue cerrado en 2011 tras revelaciones sobre abusos generalizados y fosas clandestinas halladas en sus terrenos, hechos que inspiraron la novela The Nickel Boys, ganadora del premio Pulitzer.\nAún quedan nueve ejecuciones programadas en lo que resta de 2025, lo que podría consolidar este año como el más letal desde principios de la década pasada.\nMientras tanto, organizaciones de derechos humanos, familiares de reos, víctimas y expertos legales mantienen encendido el debate sobre una práctica que, aunque legalmente vigente, enfrenta crecientes cuestionamientos éticos y sociales.\nCOMENTAR\nArchivado en:",

    "text": "This Baseball Teams Service Dog is a Major Hit\nTugger the service dog trainee is hitting a home run with the fans.\nIt’s baseball season in the US and what can possibly beat going to a stadium, enjoying hot dogs, and cheering on your favorite team? Nothing unless you pair America’s favorite summer sport with an adorable puppy.\nOn Tuesday July 1, the Philadelphia Phillies were supposed to officially welcome Tugger, a 10-week-old service dog in training to the team’s off-field roster, according to a press release from MLB. But the game had to be postponed due to rain. He made a social media debut instead.\nThe yellow lab was born on April 24, 2025, and is named for the baseball legend and marine reservist Tug McGraw. That was just two days before the golden anniversary of McGraw’s debut with the Philadelphia team.\nImportant Work\nWhen people think about service dogs, they usually think of dogs for the blind, but service animals can help people with many different disabilities or conditions, stressed the UDS Foundation. This can range from helping people with autism, muscular dystrophy, deafness, epilepsy, as well as PTSD.\nService dogs differ from emotional support animals or therapy animals that are used by hospitals, schools, and even courts to help people get through stressful times. Emotional support dogs offer comfort, but trained service dogs can do so much more.\nIn the US, service dogs have full public access rights, and this includes public buildings and transportation, restaurants, schools, and just about anywhere. Just remember that even if they are adorable, service dogs have important roles in society and are not pets.\nPartnering With Team Foster and Warrior Canine Connection\nTugger service dog training is part of a joint initiative between two nonprofits, Team Foster (an organization that has connected 500 vets with service dogs) and Warrior Canine Connection (an organization that breeds and trains service dogs), reported NBC Philadelphia.\nThe pup will train for two years before he is a fully accredited service dog, and he will be learning skills like helping with daily tasks and responding to anxiety attacks and nightmares. When his training is finished, Tugger will be placed with a vet with PTSD.\nCountry music star Tim McGraw, Tug’s son, told NBC. “The thought that this little pup will one day contribute to enhancing the quality of life for a veteran is truly remarkable. I am certain my father would have felt deeply honored to have Tugger named in his memory.”\nThe Phillies service dog initiative with the organizations was made possible through a grant from Phillies Charities, according to the press release. Tugger is the second service dog that the team has sponsored.\n“We’re incredibly honored to have a future service dog named in honor of a Phillies legend,” Rick Yount, founder and executive director of Warrior Canine Connection said in the press release. “It’s a meaningful way to carry forward his legacy — one rooted in strength, service, and impact. This special partnership with the Phillies and Team Foster is making Tugger’s mission possible and exemplifies the power of community coming together to support our nation’s veterans.”",
