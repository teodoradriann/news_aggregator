    "text": "New Delhi [India], December 28 (ANI): Union Minister and BJP leader V Muraleedharan on Thursday slammed Congress for its alleged discomfort in attending the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22. Muraleedharan said that despite receiving an invitation for Pran Pratishtha of the Ram Temple, there is no clarification from Congress.

CPI (M) said that this is a mixing of religion and politics. I want to ask CPI (M) leaders if they feel so...they should first abolish the Devaswom department and CPI (M) leaders should not go to Sabarimala temple,\" said Muraleedharan. As the date for the temple consecration ceremony nears, invitations sent to political leaders have led Congress and the Opposition's INDIA bloc into a severe political dilemma, making it difficult to take a stand on the issue.

The BJP leader further blamed Congress, saying that the party has no issue when it comes to participating in iftar or conducting a rally in favour of Palestine. \"This shows that this approach is just for the majority community, the Hindu community. Congress has no issue when it comes to participating in iftar or conducting a rally in favour of Palestine. We also have seen Congress leaders pretending to be Hindu devotees and do campaigns in elections, but when it comes to participating in Pran Pratishtha of the temple, they have doubts,\" added Muraleedharan. Earlier, the chairman of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir Construction Committee, Nripendra Misra, called on President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday. The meeting likely involved discussions on cultural initiatives and the progress of the construction of the Shri Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The interaction aimed to apprise the President of the developments in these significant projects. The chairman of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir Construction Committee also invited former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and the party's leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury for the consecration ceremony. The attendance of senior Congress leaders has not yet been confirmed by the party. The ceremony scheduled for January 22 will witness the installation of the idol of Ram Lalla at the grand temple. It is expected to be attended by hundreds of officials, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The trust has also invited 4,000 saints of all sects for the ceremony. The trust has decided to enthrone the idol of Lord Ram at the sanctum sanctorum between noon and 12.45 pm on January 22. Lakshmi Kant Dixit, a Vedic priest, is scheduled to perform the main rituals of the consecration ceremony on the day.

    "title": "Ronaldo est le premier joueur de l'histoire avec 900 buts",
    "text": "[Passer au contenu principal](#main) Cristiano Ronaldo est le premier joueur de l'histoire avec 900 buts Cristiano Ronaldo est devenu le premier joueur de l'histoire à inscrire 900 buts en matchs officiels, réalisant l'exploit jeudi dans une victoire de 2-1 du Portugal sur la Croatie en Ligue des nations de l'UEFA. Ronaldo a marqué le fameux but sur une volée à la suite d'une passe de Nuno Mendes pour placer le Portugal devant 2-0 à la 34e minute de jeu. Le public du stade de la Luz a alors exulté et l'a ovationné. Cinq fois élu Ballon d'or, il devance son plus proche poursuivant, Lionel Messi, par 58 buts. Le légendaire Brésilien Pelé est troisième sur la liste de tous les temps avec 765. Ronaldo avait aussi été le premier à franchir le cap des 800 buts, en 2021, lors de son deuxième séjour avec Manchester United. Le capitaine portugais totalise 131 buts internationaux en 209 apparitions. Il mène une fois de plus Messi (109) au premier rang dans cette catégorie, alors que ce dernier se trouve à égalité avec l'ancien attaquant iranien Ali Daei. L'équipe du Portugal a clairement dominé la rencontre malgré quelques maladresses. Les hommes de Roberto Martinez ont ouvert le score dès la 7e minute grâce à une belle action collective qui a permis à Diogo Dalot, servi par Bruno Fernandes, de trouver le chemin des filets. Il a fallu attendre la 34e minute pour que la Seleçao creuse l'écart. Sur un centre parfait de Nuno Mendes, Ronaldo, 39 ans, a conclu d'une frappe puissante et marqué le 900e but de sa carrière. Quelques minutes plus tard (41), le Portugal s'est fait une frayeur lorsque Dallot a marqué contre son camp. À la 76e minute, CR7 a raté l'occasion d'inscrire son 901e but: il a posé le ballon pour un coup franc dans l'axe, mais son tir a été stoppé par le mur des joueurs croates. Ronaldo a été remplacé à quelques minutes du coup de sifflet final par Digo Jota. La Seleçao a rendu hommage à Pepe, qui a pris sa retraite sportive le mois dernier à l'âge de 41 ans, après avoir joué 17 ans avec la sélection. Après un Euro 2024 jugé décevant, où le Portugal a été éliminé en quart de finale aux tirs au but contre la France, l'entraîneur souhaite entamer un nouveau cycle afin de préparer le prochain Mondial de 2026. Après la Croatie, les Portugais recevront, dimanche prochain à Lisbonne, l'Écosse en Ligue des nations.",
