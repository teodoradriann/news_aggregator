The lake-effect snowstorm, which dumped over 2 feet of snow on Orchard Park, was met with unwavering resolve as fans and staff joined forces to clear walkways, parking lots, and seating areas.\nBuffalo Bills and Their Unyielding Fans\nAs the snow piled up, the Bills organization made a unique appeal to its fan base. Offering $20 per hour, they enlisted the help of their loyal supporters in the mammoth task of snow removal. This call to arms was met with overwhelming response, including the aid of professional storm chaser Logan Eschrich. Despite the harsh conditions, the fans rose to the occasion, turning the stadium into a flurry of activity as they worked tirelessly to prepare for the game.\nGame Postponed, Fans Unfazed\nThe NFL, in response to the severe snowstorm, postponed the Bills’ wild card playoff game from Sunday to Monday—an action that did not deter the fans. Instead, it seemed to strengthen their resolve. Armed with shovels and dressed for the weather, they dug out the stadium, transforming the snow into celebratory confetti during the game.\nA Lesson in Perseverance\nThis event showcased the fans’ dedication and the strong bond between a team and its followers. The Bills organization, players, and fans demonstrated an unyielding spirit, emphasizing that no amount of snow could stand in the way of their love for the game.

    "text": "A few weeks ago, Daughter Number Four made her First Communion. That statement – coming from an agnostic like me – is enough to wind some people up, to prompt accusations of hypocrisy and Bouncy Castle Catholicism. Curiously, those who want to enforce the most doctrinaire version of Catholicism tend to be those who don’t regard themselves as Catholic at all. That’s not to say that there isn’t a serious issue with the continuing near-monopoly of the Catholic Church on our primary education system or with Catholic rituals being folded into their daily education. Many parents are very exercised about this issue: just not enough of them, it seems, to effect any change. Part of that could be to do with the fluid meaning of these rituals. Like a poem or a song, people can extract whatever meaning they like from a Catholic rite of passage: comfortably ignoring most or even all of the official interpretation. Religious, or to use the woollier term, spiritual belief, isn’t an on/off proposition. It’s far vaguer and more subjective than that. [ [€600 Communion money: Is it just a bribe to get people to keep the faith?](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2024/05/08/an-eight-year-old-is-leaning-on-the-doorbell-which-can-only-mean-one-thing-its-communion-season/?) ] Yet on the day, and in the church, it did feel like something significant was happening: there was a collective sense of excitement, of pride in the dressed-up children reading prayers and singing in the choir. Herself gustily sang along. She loves a good hymn. I kept thinking about what the priest had said. And how, in our pleasant few hours, children in other parts of the world lived in abject misery The priest pointed out that he had christened many of the children there and officiated at various Communions, Confirmations and weddings for many of their parents too. It gave the day a sense of continuity and tradition within the community: perhaps another reason why people still do it. Of course, Communions are also about cold, hard cash, and so as a gentle pushback against that, he pointed something else out: that the children in the church today were among the most privileged in human history. He’s not wrong. At least, so far. There is a common narrative that the Catholic Church’s near-collapse in influence in Ireland was largely driven by the sex abuse cover-ups and various other scandals. And while that might have sped up the process, it was something that was probably going to happen anyway: mainly due to affluence. Back in the days when life for ordinary people in this country was one of struggle and misery, when it was all too easy to feel that their lives were pointless and unimportant, the church had a role in explaining that, in making people feel better about themselves. Despite everything, God loves you. [ [Thinking Anew: Let’s move towards God’s ‘community of compassion and communion of love’](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2024/04/27/thinking-anew-lets-move-towards-gods-community-of-compassion-and-communion-of-love/) ] But when Ireland finally emerged as a modern, better-off country, when most people started to feel they had more agency, there was far less need for supernatural explanations. They could plan and control their own lives rather than have a god do it for them. Afterwards, we repaired to a hotel where Herself had organised a bit of a do in a function room for many of the families. There was food and a photographer and a disco for the kids. The adults sat in the sun and told each other how lovely it was. But I kept thinking about what the priest had said; and how, in our pleasant few hours, children in other parts of the world lived in abject misery. They were playing in bombed-out buildings or trying to survive malnutrition and disease. In those few hours, kids in other parts of the world had pointlessly died. [ [US, UK and Germany have sown the shame of their nations in Gaza’s blood-drenched soil](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2024/05/10/us-uk-and-germany-have-sown-the-shame-of-their-nations-in-gazas-blood-drenched-soil/) ] And in those countries, just as in Ireland not too long ago, people cleave to their religion to try to explain why all this hopeless misery is being heaped upon them. On the way home, we passed lamp-posts swathed in election posters, some of them warning about invasions from abroad, of Ireland being for the Irish: as if our nationality is an achievement rather than a happy accident of birth. They ignored the fact that the people they fear are us, just a few decades ago.",

Zwar wurde der \"Habeck-Schwachkopf\"-Klagepunkt eingestellt, doch sind zig ähnlich gelagerte Fälle anhängig. Generell ist die Verschärfung des Paragrafen 188 Absatz 1 unter Kanzlerin Merkel ein fragwürdiges Projekt gewesen. Wie der Wissenschaftliche Dienst des Bundestages im November 2024 feststellte, geht der Paragraph auf Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg zurück, der ihn 1931 erließ. Die Neuregelung von 2021 mit \"gleichzeitiger Ausweitung des Tatbestandes und der Modifizierung des Antragserfordernisses\" habe wieder zur Verschärfung geführt. Zuvor sei der Paragraph \"so gut wie nie zur Anwendung\" gekommen. Der Historiker Hubertus Knabe wies darauf hin, dass unter Honecker die strafrechtliche Verfolgung von Witzen gegen DDR-Politiker spürbar nachgelassen habe. Will Berlin jetzt den DDR-Staatschef übertreffen?\"/yyzz/DP/he",

    "title": "Island at tip of Yangtze River spearheads green power transition - People's Daily Online",
    "text": "SHANGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- At a fish farm on Hengsha Island, Shanghai, a fisherman is tending to his fishpond shaded by photovoltaic panels, scooping out a sprinkling of duckweed on the surface of the water into a bucket. While the practice of integrating fish farming with photovoltaic (PV) power generation has continued to benefit this small island situated at the easternmost tip of the Yangtze River's mouth, more green electricity innovations have propelled the island's zero-carbon transitions. Hengsha Island, boasting sufficient sunlight and wind resources, witnessed a 3.5 megawatt PV power generation project installed on the island and operated at the end of 2012 as one of Shanghai's first fishery-PV complementary projects. The PV station was built over a fishpond, with PV panels mounted three meters above water. It generates electricity while also providing shelter for shade-loving fish and pasture grass underneath. During its 25-year service life, the station is expected to generate over 3.86 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, saving 1,179.3 tonnes of standard coal per year, equivalent to reducing 3,857 tonnes of carbon dioxide and 116 tonnes of sulfur dioxide annually. Moreover, fish farming has generated financial rewards for residents. Shi Weizhong, 60, owner of a farm-stay business, adopted the fishery-PV complementary concept for the fishpond on his farm. He expected the output value of fish farming alone to reach 50,000 (about 7,011.4 U.S. dollars) to 70,000 yuan this year. In addition to the fishery-PV complementary project, Hengsha Island has also promoted distributed photovoltaic power generation projects by assembling rooftop PV panels and integrating PV power generation with power storage and charging. Yang Zhengbang, hailing from Xinchun Village of Hengsha Island, installed 60 solar PV panels on his home's rooftop in 2018. In 2023, Yang's PV panels were upgraded into an integrated system that included batteries to store surplus electricity generated during the day and to power Yang's house at night. A car charging pile was also incorporated into the system. \"After installing PV panels, I felt satisfied with the savings on my electricity bill, and now I save even more with energy storage and charging incorporated into the system,\" Yang said, \"All in all, I save about 300 yuan a month.\" According to Zhang Weiyang, a staff member at the State Grid Shanghai Changxing Power Supply Company, the integrated system running in Yang's house prevents emissions of 24.96 tonnes of carbon dioxide every month. The leading role of Hengsha Island in the green electricity endeavor offers a glimpse into Shanghai's green development initiative, exemplified by the surge in transaction volume of green electricity certificates. From January to early June, over 15 million green electricity certificates were transacted, a steep rise from the annual transaction volume of 460,000 in 2023. The trading of green electricity certificates, proof of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, offers enterprises opportunities to reach energy conservation and emission reduction targets while promoting renewable energy consumption. Shanghai has envisioned that by 2025, the transaction volume of green electricity will exceed 5 billion kilowatt-hours.

    "title": "Pittsburgh's Second Ave. Commons shelter could be closed until November | 90.5 WESA",
    "text": "90.5 WESA | By Kiley Koscinski Published August 8, 2024 at 5:25 PM EDT Facebook LinkedIn Email\nKiley Koscinski / 90.5 WESA Allegheny County officials said Thursday that they don’t expect to be able to move residents back into Second Avenue Commons until mid-November. A fire at one of the region’s largest low-barrier homeless shelters displaced more than 180 people this past June. Allegheny County officials said Thursday that they don’t expect to be able to move residents back into Second Avenue Commons until mid-November.\n“The timeline that we have suggests that it will open before the traditional opening of winter shelters,” said Erin Dalton, director of Allegheny County’s Department of Human Services.\nA county spokesperson said water damage that resulted from crews dousing flames required extensive repairs throughout the facility.\nDalton cited supply-chain problems as another challenge that repair crews were contending with. And she predicted that the reopening would initially include only the first three floors of the facility. Those floors include the engagement center, the medical clinic, a 93-bed shelter and space for 40 additional beds, which would bring the total shelter capacity to 133.\nThe county says the top two floors, which hold several dozen dorm-room style units, will take longer to repair.\nOfficials have said the fire began on the roof of the facility when an air conditioning unit overheated . No one was seriously injured in the fire, but extensive fire and water damage meant the closure of the facility as well as lost belongings for some residents.\nWESA Inbox Edition Newsletter Start your morning with today's news on Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania. County, city and nonprofit leaders set up a makeshift shelter space inside the David L. Lawrence Convention Center the same day, with shuttles taking people to their temporary space. But not everyone from Second Avenue made it to the Convention Center. And when people needed to be moved again, even fewer made it to the current shelter offering: a gymnasium at Pittsburgh Mercy’s Reedsdale Street facility.\nSome former Second Avenue residents appear to have moved into tents instead, and Dalton acknowledged that there had been a seasonal increase in the number of people living in encampments. But she claimed that the number of those who declined the Reedsdale shelter space have played little part in that trend.\n“We see increases [in encampments] when it becomes warmer outside,” she said, adding that her office’s weekly count of tents has not turned up a dramatic increase in encampments compared to this time last year.\nA mid-November time frame would align with the county’s usual procedure for expanding shelters as falling temperatures increase the danger associated with living outdoors. But there’s no guarantee that Second Avenue Commons will be ready by that point, Dalton cautioned.\n“Obviously these are construction projects with supply-chain challenges and requirements around inspection and all of that,” she said.\nNews from WESA Pa.

Officials are seeking a provider to create a 75-bed capacity shelter that could be available every night between November and March. Dalton said the window for submitting proposals will close next week, after which the county will move forward with its selection process.\nThe uncertainty facing Second Avenue Commons echoes a series of delays that preceded its opening last year. Permitting processes and construction problems pushed back its opening repeatedly. That prompted the city and county to create a “Code Blue” program, which opened additional shelter capacity when the temperature was forecast to fall below 26 degrees.\n“Our goal was to find a winter shelter where we could operate all throughout the winter,” Dalton said. “But when it became clear that that wasn't going to happen, we were able to pivot and, I think successfully operate, a shelter on the coldest nights of the year.”\nTags Politics & Government Top Story Facebook LinkedIn Email\nKiley Koscinski Kiley Koscinski covers city government, policy and how Pittsburghers engage with city services.
