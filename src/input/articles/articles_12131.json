    "text": "Britons across the country are warned for disruptive weather as stormy westerly winds lock horns with the Arctic\nDon't Miss\nMost Read\nTrending on GB News\nConflicting weather forces between Iceland and the tropical Azores will turn Britain into a 10-day \"battle zone\".\nThis weekend will kick start the chaos with nationwide warnings in force for sleet, snow and freezing rain.\nAn Atlantic storm poised to crash into Britain, currently freezing in Arctic winds, will unleash the first real winter blast of the season.\nMet Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “We have a system that is likely to track its way up from the southwest as we go towards Sunday.\nAn image of NetWeather's temperature anomaly\nNETWEATHER\n“There is likely to be some sleet and snow on the northern edge of this, and we are likely to have cold Arctic air across much of the country, coming down from the north.\n“As this system, with some warmer air in it, bashes against that colder air there is a high chance that we will see some sleet and snow.”\nBritain’s weather through the start of the year will be dominated by yo-yoing pressure currents straddling the nation – the so-called North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).\nA ‘negative phase’ of this system through the coming weeks threatens a greater risk of winds from the north and east brining colder weather.\nBurkill said: “As we go through the first week or so of January there is a slightly higher chance that we see a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).\nAn image of snowfall on January 2\nPA\n“This is looking at low pressure to the north around Iceland and high pressure to the south around the Azores and seeing what the difference is.\n“The negative NAO is more likely, and that suggests low pressure somewhere just to the south of the UK and more settled towards northern areas, and that is going to be the trend as we go through the next week or so.”\nContinuing the trend of 2024, conflicting weather models disagree on where the weekend storm will take its first swipe.\nSome models suggest it will track to the south of the UK, while others point to a northerly path meaning more widespread disruption.\nHowever, Britons across the country are warned for disruptive weather as stormy westerly winds lock horns with the Arctic.\nMet Office showing colder conditions clash with drier conditions\nMET OFFICE\nBurkill said: “This weekend it is quite likely that we will see some severe weather, and it is not out of the question that we will see some sleet and snow in parts of the south.”\nTemperatures through the coming days could drop to minus double figures in exposed parts of the north.\nThe Met Office has issued a near country-wide warning for snow this weekend as winter bares its teeth.\nLong-range forecasters warn the UK will be stuck in a weather battlefield, with storms and bitter blasts to rage through January.\nJim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services and social commentator, said: “We are going to be in a battle zone for around the next 10 days, and it is going to stay colder for much of this period.\n“Currently, we are expecting more of a northerly-north-easterly, and that could push temperatures in parts of the country to minus 16C or lower.\n“It is going to be mid-January before we get rid of this pattern.”",

The market is expected to increase from $4.36 billion in 2024 to $4.58 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.9%. Factors contributing to the growth during the historic period include the rising incidence of cancer, the demand for less invasive surgical procedures, increment in funding for medical robot research, and improvement in global healthcare infrastructure.\nWhat's the Long-Term Growth Forecast for the Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Size Through 2029?\nIn the forthcoming years, the market size of radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics is slated for robust expansion. The anticipated market value is projected at $5.75 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8%. This anticipated growth in the forecasted period can be accredited to factors such as an aging demographic, a rising embrace of robotic technology, effective tumor treatment, government backing for radiosurgery, and an increasing understanding of the advantages of radiosurgery and radiotherapy robots. Key trends during the prediction period comprise AI-assisted treatment planning, radiomics and analysis of big data, remote consultations and telesurgery, nanotechnology amalgamation, and advanced technical developments in radiosurgery robotics.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/radiosurgery-and-radiotherapy-robotics-global-market-report\nWhat Are the Key Growth Drivers Fueling the Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Expansion?\nThe growth of the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market is anticipated to be fuelled by the growing incidence of cancer. Cancer encompasses a range of diseases that can occur in almost any organ or tissue, where abnormal cells multiply uncontrollably, breach their normal boundaries and spread to other organs or infiltrate nearby body parts. In the fight against cancer, radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics are vitally important as they provide high geometric accuracy, support exact placement and imaging, and offer advanced therapeutic options for various cancers, such as pancreatic cancer. For example, a report published by the Switzerland-based Intergovernmental organization, World Health Organization, in February 2024, anticipates the cancer burden to rise to over 35 million in 2050 - a 77% increase from the estimated 20 million in 2022. Lung cancer remained most prevalent worldwide, accounting for 2.5 million or 12.4% of all new diagnoses, followed by breast cancer in women (2.3 million, 11.6%), colorectal cancer (1.9 million, 9.6%), prostate cancer (1.5 million, 7.3%), and stomach cancer (970,000, 4.9%). Consequently, the escalating prevalence of cancer is stimulating the growth of the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market. The radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market's growth is also predicted to be spurred by the rising demand for minimally invasive procedures. Minimally invasive procedures (MIPs) - surgeries performed using small incisions in the body with specialized tools and cameras inserted through these incisions - are becoming increasingly preferred. Radiosurgery and radiotherapy robots are utilized in minimally invasive treatments to deliver radiation doses to cancerous entities more accurately and reliably than traditional methods, due to robots' superior precision and consistency. For instance, a report from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, a non-profit organization based in the US, stated that out of all the medical surgeries performed in 2023, 83% were minimally invasive while the remaining 17% were traditional surgical procedures. Thus, the growing preference for minimally invasive procedures is propelling the growth of the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=12896&type=smp\nWhat Are the Key Trends Driving Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Growth?\nProminent corporations in the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market are concentrating on implementing innovative technological solutions such as the dynamic surface positioning and monitoring system to maintain their competitive edge.

    "title": "Patrick Corbin logs seven strong innings in Nationals' loss to Padres",
    "text": "Corbin weathers delay with 7 strong frames, but Nats get no-hit WASHINGTON -- [Patrick Corbin](https://www.mlb.com/player/571578) could not wait to return to the mound after a spontaneous downpour interrupted and delayed his outing five batters into Thursday afternoon’s series finale. The Nationals starter was the first player jogging back onto the field after 1 hour and 16 minutes, and he began to warm up. “We watched [Cease] before they came into this series and I said, ‘This guy, his stuff is on. It will be tough,’” manager Dave Martinez said. “On the flip side, I will give a lot of credit to Corbin. He was amazing, he was.” Washington was held to zero hits for the second time in franchise history. The last time the Nats were held to zero hits was on Aug. 8, 2023, against then-Phillies starter Michael Lorenzen. Corbin faced five batters and had begun Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim’s at-bat before the delay, leaving bases loaded with two outs. “Things like that happen,” Corbin said. “You try to keep warm and don’t know how long the weather is going to be there. So you try to stay hot and it feels good coming back out. [It was] just a tough situation there after throwing a pitch already, being behind the count. … It’s not ideal, but you try to keep loose and get out there and do your job.” When the game resumed, the battle with Kim continued. Corbin tried to get himself out of the jam, but was unsuccessful. After a nine-pitch at-bat, Kim emerged victorious with a bases-clearing single to give the Padres a 3-0 lead. The 35-year-old Corbin put the frame behind him and cruised through the rest of his outing. He dealt 109 pitches (71 strikes) in tying his season high for innings -- a feat which he completed a month ago against the Padres on [June 24](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/nationals-vs-padres/2024/06/24/745397/final/box). “Patrick, you give him the ball and he doesn’t want to come out of the game,” Martinez said. “He’s going to give you as many innings and try to get as many outs as he can.” The Los Angeles native limited the Padres to three runs, but the Nationals’ offense simply could not find an answer to Cease’s arsenal. “Today, [Cease] had both breaking balls, great shape, and we knew that coming in, but it was really good so he kept our hitters off-balance all game,” Martinez said. “I watched him all game and he never really gave us much to hit.” “He kind of picks around the plate,” Nats right fielder Lane Thomas said. “He threw a few pitches that I feel I could’ve hit, but he painted [the corners] against me. I felt like I worked a couple of good at-bats.” There were a few instances where the Nationals got a few swings with good contact off the bat. Juan Yepez, whose [15-game hit streak](https://www.mlb.com/nationals/news/juan-yepez-continues-record-breaking-hitting-streak) was snapped in the loss, sent a ball into the outfield toward Padres second baseman Xander Bogaerts. The ball slid out of Bogaerts’ glove, which would have resulted in a hit, but teammate Jackson Merrill was right there to record the out. CJ Abrams was also able to get some contact off some fastballs, which were hit hard, but “not hard enough.” Being on the no-hit side of history is not ideal. However, the Nationals will simply tip their caps to Cease and move on to their upcoming road trip to St. Louis and Arizona. “He was good. So let’s come back tomorrow. We had a chance to do something special, but we went 3-3 [on the homestand after sweeping the Reds],” Martinez said. “So let’s get back on the road and go on tomorrow. There’s nothing we can do about that. We could look back all we want, but it won’t do us any good.”",

    "text": "Yahoo Finance Canada Gas prices in these cities saw double-digit falls this week amid December 'swoon' Read full article Jeff Lagerquist December 29, 2023 at 4:00 p.m. · 4 min read Gas prices in Canada have mirrored the December \"swoon\" that analysts describe in the U.S. market. (Xavier Lorenzo via Getty Images)\nGas prices fell at a more moderate pace this week in most Canadian cities, with double-digit declines in Whitehorse and Sarnia, Ont. weighing against gains at the pump in the Maritimes. According to prices from more than 70 cities compiled by data firm Kalibrate, the average retail cost of regular gasoline fell 1.6 cents per litre to $1.457 between Dec. 21 and Dec. 28.\nHalifax and Kentville, N.S. booked the biggest increases over those seven days, with prices rising 4.9 cents.\nLast week's inflation reading from Statistics Canada showed gasoline prices fell less sharply in November (-3.5 per cent) than October, when prices dropped 6.4 per cent.\nMeanwhile, consultants at global accounting firm Ernst & Young say the federal and provincial governments should expect to subsidize purchases of electric vehicles for at least the next five years .\n“Oil has served us very well as an economy, but the technology with EVs is just so much better,” Jason Clifton, a Calgary-based partner for EY, told Yahoo Finance Canada.\nStateside, analysts say drivers can expect to end 2023 with gasoline prices around their lowest levels of the year .\n\"Last year saw a similar gasoline price swoon in December, but this year’s version has much more breadth,\" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at OPIS, told Yahoo Finance . \"The savings for consumers are substantial.”\nFollow Yahoo Finance Canada for more weekly gas price updates.

    "title": "Accelerating the REvolution – A case for developer-led responsible renewable energy - The Hindu",
    "text": "India has ambitious renewable-energy (RE) goals and currently ranks fourth globally in installed RE capacity. With a goal of tripling the capacity by 2030, the RE sector will play a pivotal role in realising India’s vision to be a green economy. Last year, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) prescribed an annual bidding trajectory for about 50 GW of RE capacity between 2023 and 2028. Notwithstanding contracting and finding buyers for this power, the speed and scale of RE deployment will bring with it challenges. Take, for example, the evacuation infrastructure needed, increased demand for raw materials, availability of land and alteration of its current role. A Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) study estimates that if extant renewable technologies continue to be the main drivers of decarbonising India’s power sector, power-generation assets could occupy between 4.9% and 6.09% of India’s total landmass by 2100, an area roughly the size of the State of Gujarat. The case, then, for scaling responsible renewable and sustainable energy deployment is clear.\nHuge employment potential Large-scale RE deployment could generate millions of new jobs over the coming decades, many of them in rural India. By 2030, we estimate that clean-energy sectors could potentially employ one million people in the country. In parallel, there can be notable effects on communities dependent on the land, due to changes in land use, alterations to ecosystems, shifts in livelihoods, and overall impacts on land productivity. As India scales up RE, balancing these interests can lead to delays in project commissioning. This has contributed to a decline in developers’ interest in RE tenders. In 2020, citing delays in allocating land for a project, wind developers reached out to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to terminate the power-purchase agreements for about 565 MW wind capacity signed with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).\nCommissioning delays pose a substantial financial and reputational risk to RE developers, who are looking to demonstrate that their projects and processes reduce risks for investors and in turn, lower the cost of financing. Therefore, in pursuit of responsible RE deployment and contributing to the betterment of communities in and around project sites, many developers support local development activities and community-led programmes via their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to augment their projects’ social and environmental benefits.\nFor instance, Tata Power Solar has set up integrated vocational training for community women and youth at multiple project sites. ReNew has a dedicated stakeholder communication strategy involving local administration, panchayats, community members and civil society organisations that informs their CSR initiatives. As the RE sector rapidly expands, such efforts need to be widely adopted and scaled up further. Existing platforms, standards and mechanisms must be strengthened further for more inclusive and responsible capacity deployment.\nProject developers have an important role in driving responsible practices, as they are the primary interface with the community in the early stages of land acquisition and construction, and in many cases also in the operational phase. Furthermore, regulators and investors want to assess responsible practices of any new project, as reflected by the introduction of reporting mechanisms such as SEBI’s Business Responsibility and Social Reporting (BRSR) to evaluate the private sector on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) norms that are now becoming universal. CSR initiatives to demonstrate developers’ stewardship in these matters must continue. However, it is equally important that responsible practices are embedded in every stage of project development – material procurement, conceptualisation and design, construction, operation and the ultimate decommissioning of a project or site. Every new project offers an opportunity to test and scale newer and emerging themes in responsible RE practices. To empower all developers to be a part of the fast-growing RE ecosystem and scale responsible practices further, there are two prerequisites.\nFirst, all stakeholders – developers, financiers and procurers – must develop a shared understanding of what constitutes responsible RE. This will ensure coordinated efforts throughout the ecosystem, to integrate and scale responsible practices. The current literature around responsible practices in project development in India, focuses on recognising and promoting universal rights, ensuring nature-positive and regenerative development, and practising people-centric participatory governance. These principles must now be tailored for the RE sector and yield more tangible indicators that can be applied at a project level and cover all stakeholders involved. These indicators must be accompanied by measurable standardised metrics and benchmarks that allow developers to continuously track and improve their performance.\nSecond, developers, along with civil society, should demonstrate and document the impact of adopting responsible practices through a few lighthouse projects. Using a responsible RE framework and building the first set of good practices, for a low-impact siting and operations of a project, they can demonstrate how their corporate ESG goals are also fulfilled. This will generate evidence for the wider adoption of responsible RE which, in due course, can be codified through policies and regulations, and even be mandated through tender document specifications.\nThis push for responsible energy is not to create new barriers for developers but is with the benefit of hindsight, that energy projects have externalities that must be addressed at the outset before they become entrenched. Responsible RE will strengthen the renewable ecosystem in India, and address roadblocks in siting, public acceptance and find the right synergy between energy security , society and the environment.\n(Akanksha Tyagi is a Programme Lead and Karthik Ganesan is Fellow and Director, Research Coordination, at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).

    "text": "Oakland Athletics closer Mason Miller has been one of the best pitchers in baseball on a team that has no use for players who are the best at anything.\nThe 25-year-old righty has 15 saves in 17 opportunities this year, twirling 40.2 innings for a sterling 0.836 WHIP and 2.21 ERA with 70 strikeouts on 14 walks (three of which were intentional). He also just threw the fastest recorded pitch in All-Star Game history .\nOn a tanking Oakland team with the fourth-worst record in baseball (41-63), Miller is also the embodiment of the Bugatti parked in at a mobile home meme.\nBut fear not because MLB’s July 30 trade deadline is nearly here and certainly a high-profile closer under long-term club control will be among the hottest names discussed by contenders. All Miller has to do between now and then is just stay healthy and he’ll get to pitch the prime of his career on a World Series contender and OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, COME ON!\nThe Oakland A’s have placed right-handed pitcher Mason Miller on the 15-day injured list retroactive to July 23 with a broken left hand and reinstated right-handed pitcher Ross Stripling from the injured list.\n— Oakland A's Communications (@AthleticsPR) July 25, 2024\nInitial reports from Oakland claimed the closer was hurt “pounding” a padded table, per MLB.com’s Martín Gallegos in a since-deleted tweet. But before you imagine this as Miller injuring himself with his own punch ( which only last happened two weeks ago ), you should know the reality is actually a lot dumber.\nGallegos clarified Miller simply placed his hand down awkwardly while preparing to do an exercise and fractured his left (non-throwing) pinky. Which, yeah, that actually sounds a lot more like something that would happen to an A’s player.\nImportant clarification on Mason Miller injury: he did not pound the table out of frustration. He put his hand down awkwardly on the training table while getting ready to do an exercise. https://t.co/BrjZHl94PB\n— Martín Gallegos (@MartinJGallegos) July 25, 2024\nThis whole scene is turning into a pretty apt metaphor for the current state of the franchise.\nThe price for Miller on the trade market was reportedly astronomical to begin with, but buyers have a way of convincing themselves to pay big price tags every year. It’s hard to imagine Oakland getting everything it wants for a player on the injured list — especially when he’s just as likely to be available next year at a lesser cost, too.\nHere’s hoping Miller heals quickly and some team looks past this incident because his arm is just way too good to be hanging out in a stadium where even the padded tables are out to get you.\nMore MLB Padres broadcaster Don Orsillo delivered a really special call for Dylan Cease's spectacular no-hitter Orioles pitcher Cionel Perez amazingly caught teammate Connor Norby’s HR in his hat while sitting in the bullpen Umpire Brian O'Nora missed a would-be, game-ending call before the D-backs flipped the game on the Royals",
