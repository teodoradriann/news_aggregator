    "text": "Dec. 27—LEBANON — The Lebanon girls basketball team lost a heartbreaker in the opening game of their annual holiday tournament Wednesday afternoon.\nPerry Meridian topped the Lady Tigers 36-35, with the Tigers missing the second of two free throws with 1.5 seconds left that would have sent the game to overtime.\n\"It comes down to turnovers again, and wanting the ball in our hands,\" Lebanon head coach Candice Huckstep said. \"We need someone out there stepping up and being a leader, and we don't have that right now. We knew this was going to be close, and free throws hurt us too, but it doesn't come down to that last possession. It just comes down to taking care of the ball, boxing out, and it was just disappointing.\"\nAfter a Ciarra Hiatt basket with six seconds left cut the deficit to 35-34, Perry Meridian's Mariah Thomas was fouled and went to the line.\nAfter making the first free throw, she missed the second and Lebanon's Claire Boling was fouled with 1.5 seconds left and had a chance to tie the game.\nShe made the first, but the second rimmed out and Perry Meridian got the rebound to seal the win.\n\"It unfortunately just didn't fall,\" Huckstep said. \"We do a lot of pressure free throws in practice. Again, it didn't come down to that free throw. Obviously, we would have loved for it to go in, but it didn't come down to that one shot.\"\nIt a tough end to what had been a back-and-forth game throughout.\nLebanon led 29-26 at the end of three quarters, and took a 31-26 lead after a basket by Jade Mount.\nPerry Meridian tied the game at 31, and after a free throw by Lebanon's Emily Sperry, the Falcons scored the next four points to go up 35-32.\nThe Tigers had the ball down three with 45 seconds to go, and had a lengthy possession where they had three attempts at the basket, but settled for Hiatt's two-pointer on a putback prior to the final seconds.\n\"We tried to let them to play through it a little bit,\" Huckstep said. \"We had a game earlier this year where we didn't call timeout and it didn't work, and then the next time we did call timeout and that didn't work, so we have had it both ways. We were struggling to get the ball in and we thought it was best to let them play through.\"\nThe Tigers trailed 11-7 after a quarter, but dominated the second eight minutes.\nLebanon held the Falcons to just two points, and took a six point lead into the locker room.\nThe Tigers led by as many as eight on a 3-pointer by Leila Richards, but saw the Falcons close to within three by the end of the quarter.\n\"We have struggled all season with being able to keep a lead,\" Huckstep said. \"There have been several games where we have a five, six, seven point leads and then just have too many turnovers and make bad decisions. Some of our decisions we are still making at this point of the season is a little disappointing.\"\nMarina Barr led the Tigers with nine points, with Sperry scoring seven points and grabbing six rebounds.\nHiatt scored six points, with Boling having six points and nine rebounds.\nThe Tigers will now play in the consolations, facing Lafayette Jeff at 4 p.m. Wednesday.\n\"It's going to be all about mental toughness,\" Huckstep said. \"We have to come in with a good mindset and listen to what we are trying to tell them coaching wise. The little details are going to matter against Lafayette Jeff. We played them in a scrimmage earlier this season, so we know a little about them and we know they aren't going to take it easy on us.\"\nWill Willems is the Sports Editor of the Lebanon Reporter.

    "text": "JAÉN, 18 Abr. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl Ayuntamiento de la capital ha recibido el premio a la Inclusión de la Asociación Autismo Jaén. El alcalde de la ciudad, Agustín González, ha recogido el galardón en el transcurso del acto de entrega de los I Premios Autismo Jaén, celebrado en la tarde de este jueves.\nGonzález ha agradecido a la entidad este reconocimiento, del que ha dicho que \"si bien refrenda el trabajo del consistorio, a través de las distintas áreas municipales, para avanzar en la inclusión plena y en la mejora de la calidad de vida de las personas con autismo y sus familias, también nos impulsa a continuar ensanchando ese camino, reforzando las líneas de colaboración conjunta con la asociación y explorando nuevas formas para apoyar sus fines\".\nEl alcalde ha asegurado que \"desde el primer momento, este equipo de Gobierno ha tenido en la inclusión y la accesibilidad universal uno de sus objetivos; tanto es así que puso en marcha la Oficina Municipal de Inclusión y Accesibilidad, un organismo de carácter transversal a través del que se trabaja para que Jaén sea una ciudad para todos, cómoda y sin barreras de ningún tipo\" al tiempo que ha insistido \"en el compromiso firme y unánime del Gobierno municipal con Autismo Jaén para continuar poniendo en marcha medidas concretas o programas específicos encaminados a conseguir los propósitos de la entidad, que desde 1995 desarrolla servicios y apoyos especializados para las personas con este tipo de trastorno y sus familias en la provincia de Jaén\".\nINICIATIVAS MUNICIPALES DIRIGIDAS A PERSONAS CON TEA Por su parte, la directora de la Oficina Municipal de Inclusión y Accesibilidad, Elena Araque, ha destacado que \"son múltiples las vías en las que trabajamos desde el Ayuntamiento para mejorar las condiciones de vida e integrar a personas con trastorno del espectro autista en diferentes eventos de la vida social\" y ha puesto ejemplos concretos \"como la reciente entrega de un kit para personas autistas a 15 niños y niñas, de manera que han podido disfrutar del partido que ha enfrentado al Real Jaén y al Torre del Mar en el Estadio Municipal de La Victoria\".\n\"El objetivo de la iniciativa, que se ha llevado a cabo gracias a la colaboración de los patronatos de Asuntos Sociales y Deportes y la Oficina Municipal de Inclusión y Accesibilidad, era acercar a este colectivo a la vida pública y conseguir su inclusión plena en la sociedad a través del deporte; se trata de una experiencia piloto y, dado el éxito, se aplicará en otros ámbitos\", ha añadido.\nAraque ha agregado que, por otra parte, \"el Ayuntamiento diseñó una Feria de San Lucas accesible el pasado año; estableció un día sin ruido, una caseta de accesibilidad y estipuló entrada prioritaria en las atracciones para niños con TEA. Asimismo, estos niños pudieron ver a los Reyes Magos con pase prioritario, sin hacer colas, o disfrutaron de un paseo navideño en el tren de Alsa para poder ver las luces de navidad de nuestra ciudad\".\n\"Además, el Ayuntamiento de Jaén se ha sumado al Día Mundial de Concienciación sobre el Autismo, celebrado el 2 de abril. Con tal motivo se iluminó de azul su fachada, como muestra de apoyo y solidaridad con las personas con autismo y sus familias. Se trata de iniciativas que han dado excelentes resultados y que seguiremos reforzando, al tiempo que, en breve, pondremos en marcha otras nuevas que persiguen, asimismo, la integración y mejora de la vida de estas personas\", ha añadido.\nLeer más acerca de: Jaén",

    "text": "Israa Farhan Pakistan has banned New Year's celebrations in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, announced the government on Thursday, urging citizens to observe \"simple\" forms of festivities.\nIn a televised message to the nation, Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar stated that due to the situation in Gaza, the government has \"completely banned all types of New Year's celebration activities.\"\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas erupted on October 7 following an unprecedented attack by the movement on southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to a count by AFP based on the latest Israeli official figures.\nThe attack also led to the taking of about 250 hostages, with 129 of them still held in Gaza , according to Israel.\nSince then, Israel has carried out intense shelling of Gaza and initiated ground operations starting on October 27, resulting in over 21,000 casualties, most of whom are women and children, according to the Ministry of Health controlled by Hamas.\nKakar stated on Thursday that \"the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim world deeply mourn the genocide of oppressed Palestinians, especially the massacre of innocent children in Gaza and the West Bank.\"\nPakistan typically celebrates New Year's Eve with fireworks and a bank holiday on January 1.\nOn Thursday, the Emirate of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates also banned the launching of fireworks on New Year's Eve due to the war in Gaza.",

    "text": "In Kachin state, Northern Myanmar, military forces detained dozens of Christian leaders, pastors, and youth on Thursday on suspicion of aiding rebel forces in the country’s ongoing civil war. Radio Free Asia Burmese reported that roughly 100 soldiers initially detained more than 200 villagers in a school, where they were threatened and interrogated. Some were beaten, including local Christian leaders. The soldiers released the villagers after nearly nine hours of questioning about their ties to the Kachin Independent Army (KIA) and other anti-Junta militias. In recent months, two pastors were murdered, and numerous Christians have been harassed and beaten in Kachin state, which has a large Christian population. According to the 2020 Burmese Population and Housing Census Report, about 34% of Kachin state’s 1.6 million residents are Christians. Some advocacy groups estimate that that number is closer to two-thirds of the state’s population. The KIA has been hugely successful in Northern Myanmar recently, capturing and defeating several military junta camps. Subsequently, the junta forces are actively raiding Kachin villages, seeking information on KIA forces.

    "title": "Tributes paid to ‘incredibly courageous’ surgeon Professor Sir Roy Calne",
    "text": "Tributes paid to ‘incredibly courageous’ surgeon Professor Sir Roy Calne Dame Esther Rantzen has paid tribute to an “incredibly courageous” surgeon who performed the first liver transplant in Europe. The former BBC journalist said Professor Sir Roy Calne, who died on Saturday aged 93, got in touch with her to ask for help to save a two-year-old boy who had weeks to live unless he found a donor. At the time, the numbers of transplant surgeries had fallen following a BBC Panorama programme that raised concerns about the field, she said. Despite the television industry’s concerns about transplants, Sir Roy contacted Dame Esther to put young Ben Hardwick, who was suffering with biliary atresia, on her TV show That’s Life!, she told the PA news agency. Dame Esther, 83, said: “He rang That’s Life!, we got a crew together that day and (Ben’s mother) made a speech in which she said that ‘this would be the greatest gift in life, and it might be the only comfort for a family whose only baby had passed away’ – we put her on the air, with quotes from Roy Calne, and it absolutely took off. “When (Ben’s mother) came to him and said ‘how can we change public opinion?’, and he said ‘television’, – I thought that was incredible, it was forgiving of the medium and it was also right, because at that time we were able to reach so many people and the rest of the media took it up too. “Within a week a donor was found. “He was not only a brilliantly skilled surgeon but he had immense courage. “I just think he was a wonderful example of a pioneering, brilliant medical practitioner in Britain working in the NHS.” She said a philanthropist offered to take Ben to America to get help after the show aired, but she responded “You don’t need to, we’ve got Professor Calne and he will do it under the NHS”. She added: “Roy performed the surgery on Ben and other children – as a result of our story people became aware of the desperate need for transplants.” The show started their friendship, she said, adding: “I have some beautiful watercolours by (Sir Roy) in pride of place in my home. “The thing about surgeons is they’re very, very gifted, good with their hands – he was also very talented artist. “He was funny, I remember having dinner with him. “I think it was steak and kidney pie and he carefully dissected one of the kidneys, which made it quite difficult to eat. “He was excellent company, but the thing that impressed me so much was the skill he had, the profession he was dedicated to.” Mike More, chair of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH), paid tribute to Sir Roy on behalf of Cambridge University Hospitals, which named a transplant unit in the city’s Addenbrooke’s Hospital after the surgeon. He said: “I offer my deepest condolences to the family of Professor Sir Roy Calne. “He was a true pioneer of transplant surgery, not only carrying out many UK, European and world firsts in surgery but also inspiring future generations of clinicians. “Sir Roy leaves behind a truly amazing legacy and many of our staff will remember him with fondness for his vision and genuine kindness. We will all miss him very much.”",

How? Do I go to my room? Do I get expelled from the tournament.’\nThe row has once again thrown light on FIDE, the game’s governing body which was rocked by claims that American chess prodigy Hans Niemann used ‘vibrating anal beads’ to beat world number one Magnus Carlsen in 2022.\nNiemann sued for $100 million Carlsen after the Norwegian repeated online rumors that he had been told what moves to play through buzzes from a coach transmitted to a sex toy hidden in his body.\n‘It must be embarrassing for the world champion to lose to me,’ he told reporters.\n‘I feel bad for him!’\nHe credited a ‘ridiculous miracle’, for his victory, claiming he had watched a video of Carlsen using a similar game plan in a game four years earlier that morning.\nThe pair settled out of court but the story gained an unexpected afterlife this week when a champion of Xiangqi, the Chinese variant of the game, was accused of using the technique to win the title of ‘Xiangqi King’ at a tournament in the country.\nKazarian was all smiles as she arrived in her shoes for the day’s play unaware that she was about to clash with the game’s authorities\nKazarian was the 2020 Dutch Women’s Internet Chess Champion and has also been an under-16 girls’ European Youth Champion\nYan Chenglong (pictured, right) defecated in a hotel bathroom, and is accused of using anal beads to cheat at the Chinese Xiangqi Association competition\nNineteen-year-old chess prodigy Hans Niemann previously declared he would play naked to prove doubters wrong after rumors suggested he could have used vibrating anal beads\nThe sport was left in uproar on Monday when national champion Yan Chenglong was stripped off his title after being accused of defecating in a hotel bathroom.\n‘Yan consumed alcohol with others in his room on the night of the 17th, and then he defecated in the bathtub of the room he was staying in on the 18th,’ the Chinese Xiangqi Association said in a statement.\n‘An act that damaged hotel property, violated public order and good morals, had a negative impact on the competition and the event of Xiangqi, and was of extremely bad character.’\n‘Based on our understanding of the situation, it is currently impossible to prove that Yan engaged in cheating via ‘anal beads’ as speculated on social media,’ it added.\nChess fans on social media were quick to point out male players who have not been sanctioned for wearing sports shoes.\n‘As a PE teacher I can tell you those are most certainly not sport shoes,’ tweeted @chesslete.\n‘They’re sports shoes if you were playing in the NBA 60 years ago,’ added les miens miserables.\nThe match shook up the chess world – after Niemann, a rising talent from San Francisco, unceremoniously defeated the Norwegian world at last year’s prestigious Sinquefield Cup\n‘Not so much these days.’\nPavel Tregubov, FIDE’s technical delegate at the tournament apologized for the upset and said that the governing body is planning to revise its dress code.\n‘If she felt like a criminal, I’m very sorry for that,’ he added.\n‘Usually the arbiters are shy,’ he added, ‘It’s not like in football.’",

Harris pledged continued military support for Ukraine amidst partisan divides in the U.S. presidential race. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Washington DC | Updated: 27-09-2024 02:02 IST | Created: 27-09-2024 02:02 IST - Country: - United States Vice President Kamala Harris strongly criticized proposals by Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance for Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, labeling them as 'dangerous and unacceptable'. Harris made the comments during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, pledged continued military assistance to Ukraine if elected, emphasizing that suggestions from her Republican opponents were not peace proposals but 'proposals for surrender'. While in Washington, Zelenskyy sought to solidify U.S. support for Ukraine's defense as the war against Russia becomes increasingly politicized ahead of the U.S. presidential election. President Joe Biden also reaffirmed his commitment to support Ukraine with additional military aid before leaving office. (With inputs from agencies.)",
