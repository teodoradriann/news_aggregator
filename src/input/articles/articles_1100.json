    "title": "Chicago weather: Snow totals from spring snowstorm",
    "text": "A late-season snowstorm accompanied by thunder and lightning hit the Chicago area Friday and looks to continue through the early evening. By far, the heaviest band of snow has set up over the northern tier of Illinois counties where several inches of heavy, wet snow have already fallen. McHenry County is under a Winter Storm Warning until 4 p.m. Friday.Parts of Lake and McHenry counties will end up with more than a half foot of snow before it’s over.The band of heavy snow will have to swing southeast Friday afternoon through more of Chicagoland. This will likely accumulate around an inch or so quickly during the afternoon commute. Main roads will likely be just wet but elevated surfaces and less-traveled roads will see a quick slushy covering. The snow exits the area after 8 p.m. There’s a chance for some light lake-effect snow showers overnight into tomorrow morning. Where the snow is deepest, temperatures may not get much above freezing tomorrow. The real thaw will get underway Sunday.The weekend looks sunnier Saturday with highs around 40 degrees, but colder over the deeper snowpack.Sunday will be cloudier with a gusty wind and highs in the mid 40s.It still looks like rain Monday and Tuesday with highs around 60 degrees Monday then lower 50s Tuesday.",

    "title": "Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl review - a vast wasteland of jank and jeopardy",
    "text": "Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl review - a vast wasteland of jank and jeopardy\nZoning out.\nStalker 2 was made in the midst of war. You've probably heard how Ukranian studio GSC Game World bussed workers out of the country shortly before the Russian invasion. Or how some developers have died in the war. While the first-person shooter released this week doesn't assault the player with overt references to that ongoing conflict, small glimpses of Ukrainian nationalism do peek through - the flag's colours on a box of matches, a field of poppies marking the eerie resting spot of fallen soldiers.\nIn the end, there are far fewer references to Europe's geopolitical nightmare than there are glitches and bugs. You're not getting an ambitious but broken shooter with Stalker 2, you're getting an ambitious but broken shooter that has more reason to be glitchy than any game in recent history. It can feel petty, in such circumstances, to mention the twitching leg of a random NPC. And yet, to ignore those bugs would be an equal disservice, especially when they almost feel like an essential part of Stalker as a series. After 30 hours of traipsing the wasteland, there is a weird sense that Stalker 2 is more of a Bethesda game than even [Todd Howard](https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard) can ship.\n[Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJqoOpoYcfk)\nFor those unfamiliar with the previous games, you'll be thrown into its world as forgivably as can be expected. Your character, Skif, has his home destroyed by a meteor-like macguffin, and comes to \"the Zone\" to find out what said macguffin is. The Zone is a huge tract of land around Chornobyl, cordoned off by a massive perimeter wall, behind which lies all sorts of mutants, anomalies, radiation, and paramilitaries. And when I say huge, I mean that. It's 64km squared, meaning you can squeeze [Fallout 4](https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019) into it six times - or three Death Strandings, which is maybe a better comparison, considering the amount of quiet walking through deserted space you'll be doing.\nWithin your first hours you'll discover a different, older philosophy to the open world shooter. You still ramble about, doing quests and collecting loot. But there are no modern amenities like Far Cry's enemy tagging or the ever-popular X-ray vision to keep you in a comfortable blanket of combat awareness. Fast travel is not some instantly available service, but relies on you finding a guide in one of the major settlements (and even then they'll only take you to other big hubs - for a price). Clothes and gas masks have a durability meter and you must keep your AK-47 in good nick, or it will jam, a disempowering trick from [Far Cry 2](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-2) not often spotted in recent years.\nThere are some gestures to modern sensibilities, such as the white markers that appear to show you're being spotted. But largely there's a feeling of playing something outside the realms of today's blockbuster conventions. In its finest moments, gunfights are scrappy, brief, and full of swear words. You get two blasts off with a shotgun but the jerk still stands. You swap to a submachine gun that jams after a single round, and while you're dealing with that, a grenade lands at your feet. Shit.\nIt's all recognisable to any shooter aficionado, but is made tense and gritty by the atmosphere of scarcity, not to mention the lack of features many shooters have come to rely on for clean and flowing fights.\nBut that's the combat at its best. At its worst, encounters can be comic death slaps, with enemy AI behaving in wacky, unpredictable ways, or soldiers spawning right next to you. Mutant enemies are especially jerky in their movement. Any time rats or dogs or wild boars appeared, I knew I was in for an annoying fight. Once, a herd of piggy mutants would not stop reappearing behind a farmhouse, no matter how many I seemed to kill, my ammo dwindling to nothing as I became a frustrated one-man slaughterhouse.\nCombine this with the noisy vegetation and drab green-brown colour of everything on screen, and you have a world that is hostile, both intentionally and unintentionally. You will sometimes be shot in the dark without understanding who got you. Or knocked down and savaged by a swamp mutant without being able to get up and heal before the next hit lands. Fights are especially challenging in natural spaces, where the bonkers visual fidelity also means a lot of bushy interference, the trees and grass matching exactly the desaturated uniforms of every enemy soldier. Some shootouts can occur without much usable cover, and when bullets are this painful (I'm playing on normal mode) it can feel a bit like your fate is sometimes in the hands of a random, unlucky spawn.\nMuch of this challenge is a smirking invitation to the sink-or-swim hardcore, an appeal to those who yearn for combat awareness and the grimacing survival of previous Stalker games. Camouflage is a part of war and so is unpredictable enemy movement. Also, you will simply quicksave a whole bunch, greatly lessening the pain of death. In other moments, as when enemies pop into existence before your very eyes, it just feels like an old-fashioned case of jank. Stealth camo bloodsuckers are a true nuisance, coming so close during an attack that you have to spin at massive angles to catch them in the act of appearing. They almost seem to attack through you.\nThey aren't alone in being hard to spot. Heart Of Chornobyl's environments channel the radiation of its namesake, in that many threats are invisible, or close to invisible. You have to become aware of wobbling air or swirling leaves at a moment's notice, alert to the crackling static snow at the edge of your screen. Compared with the threats of other video game wastelands, Stalker sometimes feels like its anomalies are the result of a low budget creative solution (you don't have to animate radiation - it's just a field of air that hurts). But they also feel appropriate to the setting in a way that is faithful to the series. This is not the rainbow oily dangerzone of Jeff VanderMeer's Annihilation. This is the mundane concrete world of Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, where the most brightly coloured threat is a whirling wisp of red petals that will put you to sleep forever.\nStill, some anomalies are underwhelming. Basically \"what if fire?\" or \"what if electricity?\" When ball lightning patrols a corridor in a set pattern, and I must dash past with a timed sprint, I feel like I'm playing Mario, as opposed to navigating a deadly natural phenomenon. Others induce a grander wonder - such as one throbbing orb of warped air that expands and contracts, crushing and uncrushing vehicles with each push and pull of its heartbeat pulse.\nBetter yet is the anomalous weather. Storms are common, with debris whipping about in the wind as lightning lands mere feet from you. More threatening is an Emission, which is basically an ultra fiery aurora that paints the sky the hot orange of a raging furnace. Get caught outside while one of these is happening and you are toast. It's an atmospheric delight to sprint into a nearby hovel and wait out the falling sky with a total stranger, a fellow Stalker who just happened to be nearby when the warning sirens blared.\nThese incidental moments are more effective at communicating the Zone's terror and wonder than anything another character will say to you. In terms of storytelling, it takes its cues from the cinematic shooters that have filled the gap between this and the last Stalker game in 2009. People talk at you about factional squabbles, or have disputes in front of you, or brawl with you in dizzying, slappy fights. You are given choices - help one crowd or another, kill a guy or spare him - but very little of it lands in a consequential way, simply because so many of the characters are as drab as their uniforms. I mentioned Bethesda games as a counterpart, because it often feels like what Stalker 2 is aiming for. But Stalker 2 doesn't have anything close to the same hooky quality in its main quest. Your guy is in the Zone because he has \"nowhere else to go\", a real shrug of a motivation.\nThe supporting characters don't offer many threads of storytelling that are any more interesting. The main quests are full of moments when people you barely know eject information at you, a parade of proper nouns and acronyms. Nevertheless, off you trot to find a guy called Richter, who'll tell you to look for a guy called Diode, who'll tell you to look for a guy called Nestor, who's being held by a guy called Varan. Basically all quests in the first 20 hours form a chain of man names. Almost every quest giver can be asked some version of: \"Why don't you do this yourself?\", when a more pertinent question would be: \"Why should I care?\"\nThere's also a homogeneity to the soldiers of the Zone that feels distracting at times - an endless truckload of men with the same haircut, the same gruff pessimism, the same iffy voice acting. If Stalker has taken much of its mechanical inspiration from 2007, it has also taken its approach to casting from the same era. I met a woman once, after 26 hours of playing. She acted like all the other men. It's possible there's some thoughtful lore to explain the Zone's lack of diversity, and I simply didn't clock it. But regardless of intent the story remains a homogenous parade of lads being lads, where one man bleeds into another, literally and figuratively.\nThis dull questing means you have to become motivated more by the collecting of loot, the examining of new environmental phenomena, or simply the unlocking of new areas of the map - a huge draw for the explorers among us. If you're not a firearm fetishist when you begin Stalker 2, you might be by the end of it. Finding a 12-gauge shotgun in perfect condition is cause for celebration, doubly so if the previous owner gave it an intimidating name like \"Predator\".\nEach settlement will have a tech fella who can repair weathered weapons or increase their range, spread or accuracy. But if you're anything like me, you may forgo a greater magazine size just to install a stock that'll take a kilogram off the gun's weight. Since finding truly great guns is infrequent (and since you may pump a lot of \"koupons\" into a single AK-47) you do start to get attached to particular weapons. By encouraging you to invest in the best gun you have, it makes weaponry meaningful and significant in a way that other big shooters entirely ignore. Simply liking guns will carry you most of the way through the game.\nThat is, if you aren't waylaid by the other inclement weather: the bugs. We've already listed quite a lot of these in [a post earlier this week](https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review). Some have been [fixed in a pre-launch patch](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-tech-review-pc-xbox-series-x-s), including many of the sound issues mentioned, but many haven't. And judging by the past games, I wouldn't bet my koupons on everything being tidied away even months from now. There are many instances where that bugginess still affects quests, gets you killed, or leaves you befuddled, and it all hurts the game's natural playability quite badly, even if it is often funny.\nThe thing is, Stalker games have always been glitchy. But they made up for it with a grim-faced, survivalist philosophy of play. GSC have simply done the same thing again, this time on a grander scale and against the extraordinary backdrop of a real war. The average player, of course, won't be thinking about the game as a source of Ukrainian pride, but as a compelling and often busted survival shooter that frustrates and satisfies at alternating pitch, like the staccato racket of a rifle that intermittently jams in the middle of an exciting fight. Divorced from its context, Stalker 2 is as Stalker as Stalker games stalk. Fully married to its context, the game is proof that art and the creation of art deserves its place even in times of great strife. In a realm of radioactive jank, the stalkers of the Zone play guitar, they listen to the radio, and they tell jokes to one another, all while sheltering from a glowing sky.\nA copy of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl was provided for review by developer GSC Game World.",

Policía Nacional\nEspaña SECTAS Itziar, la líder de la secta de Cáceres, drogaba a niños en sus rituales y sacó 2 millones a sus víctimas Se había bautizado a sí misma como la \"Maestra de Maestros\". Sostenía que la homosexualidad era una enfermedad que se curaba acostándose con ella. 24 diciembre, 2023 02:29 guardar Cáceres Homosexualidad Ministerio del Interior Policía Nacional Sectas Valverde de la Vera (Cáceres) Brais Cedeira Ismael Monzón Itziar Torrecilla Gorbea, la líder de la secta de Cáceres identificada por la Policía Nacional , llegó a amasar durante más de dos décadas una fortuna de cerca de dos millones de euros gracias a las actividades de la organización que gestionaba junto a su pareja, el psicólogo José Carlos Alvero, también detenido esta semana. Entre esas actividades, se incluyen rituales que ella anunciaba como sesiones terapéuticas y en los que suministraba drogas a sus adeptos.\nEntre las personas a las que llegó a dar sustancias como el MDMA, el peyote o la ayahuasca había menores de edad, hijos de algunos de sus más fieles, que crecieron durante años en ese ambiente.\nItziar tiene cerca de 60 años. Es periodista de formación. Se había bautizado a sí misma como la \" Maestra de Maestros \".\nEn el año 1998, fundó una suerte de comunidad junto a su pareja. Desde entonces, y según la investigación, decenas de personas han pasado años atrapadas, sometidas contra su voluntad.\nItziar sostenía que la homosexualidad era una enfermedad, y prometía curar a sus feligreses mediante \"sexo sanatorio\" con ella. También con sesiones a base de drogas y sustancias psicoactivas.\n🚔Detenidos los líderes de una secta destructiva en un municipio de #Cáceres\n🚨Suministraban estupefacientes y psicoactivos a sus adeptos durante las pseudo terapias\n👉 Consideraban la #homosexualidad una enfermedad y ofrecían terapias \"sanatorias\" pic.twitter.com/rbr9CbXBHG\n— Policía Nacional (@policia) December 23, 2023 Sobre el papel, su negocio era una especie de escuela en la que se promocionaban terapias alternativas. En realidad, tal y como ha descubierto el Grupo de Sectas Destructivas de la Comisaría General de Información (CGI) de la Policía Nacional, tanto ella como su pareja se dedicaban a manipular a sus víctimas, consiguiendo presuntamente anular su voluntad durante años y logrando que les pagasen considerables cantidades de dinero a cambio de insólitos remedios sin ninguna base científica.\nEsas estrafalarias soluciones que Itziar proponía a quienes recurrían a ella, señalan fuentes de la investigación a EL ESPAÑOL, propiciaron que muchos se aislasen de su entorno. Algunos pusieron en riesgo su salud física y psíquica al abandonar la medicina convencional y los tratamientos avalados por la evidencia científica.\nEsto les ocasionó no solo un riesgo para su salud. También un fraude económico. Según revelan los investigadores, Itziar cobraba sus sesiones individuales a 200 euros cada una . Las grupales a 500 . Y así, con decenas de seguidores que recurrían a ella año tras año, había logrado amasar una fortuna que la Policía Nacional y la Agencia Tributaria estiman en al menos 2 millones de euros.\nLos expertos en sectas de la Comisaría General de Información han recabado los testimonios de al menos 13 víctimas que se han atrevido a contar sus casos . Cuentan que en sus mejores momentos la secta llegó a contar con hasta 50 seguidores, cuya voluntad había sido absolutamente anulada. En la actualidad, unas 20 personas acudían a sus sesiones.\n[Cae una secta en Cáceres que prometía curar la homosexualidad teniendo sexo con la gurú del grupo]\nGracias a las víctimas que dieron el paso de hablar, los investigadores lograron averiguar el modus operandi de una mujer que basaba su método en su carisma personal y en la presunta manipulación mental.\nEl centro respondía al nombre de Escuela Aquí. En él, los dos miembros de la pareja se presentaban como expertos en terapia gestalt , una pseudociencia que se basa en la curación a través de canales sensoriales como la percepción o la memoria.\nLos expertos en sectas consultados por EL ESPAÑOL, así como los investigadores de la Policía Nacional, advierten de que se están descubriendo cada vez más derivaciones delictivas de esta corriente.\n\"Seres humanos nuevos\" Las víctimas le contaron a la Policía Nacional que la gurú y su pareja ofrecían a los alumnos un curso con el que prometían formar \"seres humanos enteramente nuevos\" . Para ello buscaban alejar a los pacientes y tratar de que terminasen repudiando a su familia.\nItziar y José Carlos, señalan desde la Policía Nacional, aislaban a los integrantes de la secta , en algunos casos llevándose a las familias con hijos a una casa de campo que figura a nombre de la secta.\n\"La gente se acercaba a ellos como si fueran psicólogos normales. Les consultaban desde problemas en el trabajo, o con la pareja, como en sesión de terapia normales. Ella detectaba los puntos débiles o las flaquezas de estas personas y actuaba\", señalan fuentes de la investigación.\nSegún constataron los policías, la gurú llegaba incluso a recurrir a ataques personales. \" Todo se transformaba dentro . Humillaba y vejaba a personas que recurrían a ella\".\nLlegó un punto en que la cosa cambió. \"Las sesiones empezaron a girar en torno a lo que ella llamaba energía sexual . Acusaba a unos y otros de mirarse con intenciones lascivas. A ellas las llamaba 'guarras' o 'cerdas' por intentar provocar al resto\", señalan fuentes de la investigación.\nSexo como remedio Su estrategia estaba enfocada constantentemente en el sexo como forma de poder. Los líderes de la secta describían a los padres de sus clientes como \"violadores\". Les aseguraban que ellos eran los responsables de que mantuvieran una sexualidad adulterada.\nEn un rocambolesco razonamiento, señalan desde la Policía Nacional, Itziar defendía que los hombres estaban enamorados de sus madres y, al no poder tener sexo con ellas, algunos se convertían en homosexuales .\nEn el caso de las lesbianas, el argumento de la gurú era que en casa habían escuchado demasiadas críticas de sus madres a sus padres.\n\"Al homosexual le decía que su relación con las mujeres no había sido sana, que tenía que ponerse en una etapa de abstinencia. Tras ese período, el tratamiento pasaba a veces por acostarse con ella\", relatan fuentes de la investigación.\nDentro de este contexto de terapias grupales, la investigación ha determinado que la gurú, que se presentaba a sí misma como una suerte de chamán, facilitaba en ocasiones marihuana, peyote y ayahuasca , presuntamente para facilitar el sometimiento de las víctimas.\nLa terapia, entonces, consistía en ofrecer en algunos casos un cóctel de drogas, como el MDMA o LSD, ambas con efectos alucinógenos. Y llegado el caso, la sesión podía derivar en tener sexo con alguno de los líderes con el presunto objetivo de \"curar\" la homosexualidad de los alumnos.\nEl psicólogo Miguel Perlado, uno de los mayores expertos de España en el mundo de las sectas, publicó sus investigaciones sobre el grupo ahora arrestado y desmantelado en el blog EducaSectas. En esa publicación señalaba cómo Itziar obtuvo su inspiración de otro supuesto terapeuta llamado Antonio Asín, experto en terapia biogestalt . Un tipo condenado a una pena de siete años de prisión por haber abusado sexualmente de una antigua paciente durante cuatro años consecutivos.\nSimular violaciones Para estimular esos traumas relacionados con la sexualidad, según señalan fuentes de la investigación, los gurús ordenaron en una de los sesiones que dos de sus seguidores simulasen una violación . Eso sí, sin tocarse, sin quitarse la ropa ni llegar a representar la penetración, para que el resto quedara impresionado.\nEn la puesta en escena también estaban presentes las parejas de cada uno de los participantes, con el objetivo de traumatizarles.\nEl Grupo de Sectas Destructivas de la Policía Nacional descubrió que el perfil de las víctimas de la escuela de Itziar Torrecilla y José Carlos Albero era el de personas con un alto nivel de estudios y con alto nivel adquisitivo, incluso líderes de empresas de cierta relevancia. Al margen del coste de las sesiones, algunos de ellos participaban en la financiación del grupo con donaciones privadas.\nPese a que tenían sede en Madrid y se habían desplazado a Valverde de la Vera (Cáceres) para realizar sus retiros, su perfil público fue decreciendo con el paso de los años. La escuela retiró su página web y el acceso a la secta se producía sólo a través de conocidos. Tras haber pasado unas horas detenidos por la Policía, ahora sus líderes esperan en libertad a ser citados para la primera vista oral ante el juez.\n ",

His death was confirmed last week.\nWeinstein, a mother of four and grandmother of seven, was an English teacher who specialized in helping children with special needs, Kibbutz Nir Oz said.\n\"For the past few years she has also taught Mindfulness to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety caused by the ongoing rocket fire from Gaza,\" the kibbutz said. \"Judy was a poet, entrepreneur, and pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement that he's \"devastated\" to learn of Weinstein's death.\n\"We are holding Judith and Gad's four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts,\" Biden said. \"I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me.

Due to heavy smoke development, local residents received a NL Alert shortly after midnight.\nvideo-caption\">First images of major fire Heerhugowaard – VLN\nNews\nInitial images show flames shooting out of the roof of the company. The fire brigade is now allowing the building to burn out in a controlled manner and is trying to prevent the fire from spreading to adjacent buildings.\nThe fire may have spread more quickly because the wind is blowing very hard in the region, thanks to storm Gerrit.\nThe fire started around 10:30 p.m. The\npolice have cordoned off a large area around the building. The company is located close to the Heerhugowaard train station, but for the time being there appear to be no disruptions to the train connection.\nThe N242 runs on the other side of the company. Due to the smoke development, it was closed by the emergency services near Heerhugowaard. It is unclear for how long.\nLocal residents and people in the area have been warned with an NL Alert to stay away from the smoke. The smoke moves from Nijverheidsstraat over the area between Westerweg and Costerstraat. Anyone who is bothered by smoke at home should close windows and doors and switch off mechanical ventilation.\nMeasurements are taken to see exactly how far the smoke spreads.\nThe fire brigade has warned people not to approach the fire. They emphatically ask for space to be given to the emergency services.\nIt is currently unclear whether people were still present in the building when the fire broke out. It is also not yet known whether there have been any injuries.\nTo view this content you must accept cookies.
