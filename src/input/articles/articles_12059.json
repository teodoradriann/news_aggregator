    "title": "Queensland power supply to face strain as heatwave sends demand to near-record levels | Energy | The Guardian",
    "text": "Queensland’s electricity supplies are expected to be strained for a second day in a row as the heatwave roasting much of northern Australia lifts power demand to near-record levels.\nThe mercury exceeded its forecast maximum for Brisbane of 37C by early afternoon and was recently at 38.3.5C, or eight degrees above the December average, Bureau of Meteorology data showed.\nQueensland is in the midst of a multi-day heatwave, with temperatures tipped to rise into the mid-40C range in some inland places on Friday. Brisbane's maximum is forecast to reach 37C, with nearby towns nudging 40C.

(Sources: @AEMO_Energy , @WattClarity ) pic.twitter.com/JTgklFrFdh\n— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) December 28, 2023 Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy specialist at the University of NSW, said Thursday’s demand was “certainly an outlier by historical standards by quite a margin”.\nPower demand was about 1327MW higher than the previous highest day during the Christmas-New Year period, set during on 31 December 2016, he said.\nMcConnell said one difference between Thursday and today would be a lower power demand in New South Wales. That meant it should be a “safer day from the electricity system perspective, but it’s still pretty incredible” to have demand running so high.\nQueensland’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said the state’s power system “remains secure, and available supply exceeds demand”.\n“Queenslanders have a power system with more than adequate supply because they own it, and the Miles government will keep it that way – owned by Queenslanders,” de Brenni said.\n“During the ongoing hot conditions across our state, our number one concern is that Queenslanders keep safe – this means staying out of the sun and keeping cool and well hydrated,” he said.\nMeanwhile 750 Energex crews had restored power to more than 100,000 customers across the state’s southeast. About 27,400 customers were still have their power switched back on, de Brenni said.\nNear the demand peak on Thursday, wholesale spot prices reached almost $15,000 a MW-hour, Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) data shows. That compared with an average of about $65/MWh in the most recent weekly figures released by the ASX.\nAccording to Aemo’s data, demand on Thursday peaked at 9680MW, making it the 10th highest recorded in Queensland. The highest came in March this year, with demand reaching 10,070MW.\nAn Aemo spokesperson said Queensland’s demand could reach 9,900MW later on Friday, which would be the fourth-highest on record if reached.\nQueensland's electricity demand reaching almost 9800MW, or close to @AEMO_Energy 's forecast high of 9900MW (which would be 4th highest ever for the state - and more than 1000MW higher than the previous high for this time of year - excluding yesterday). pic.twitter.com/AUq2z8BBf5\n— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) December 29, 2023 Queensland consumers, though, were fortunate that the increase in power demand wasn’t later in the summer, McArdle said.\n“Imagine what would have happened to the demand levels had this same weather pattern hit us late in January or early February 2024 with industry and commercial industrial energy users back at work!?,” he said, adding that the state would surely set a new demand peak if it did.\nNew South Wales also faced strains on its grid earlier this summer.\nA one-day heat spike on 14 December, combined with the Mt Piper coal-fired power station losing half its capacity of about 1400MW due to a fault, prompted the state government to appeal to consumers to reduce their energy usage to avoid blackouts.\nAcross northern Australia, some high 40C temperatures may be reached in the next couple of days. (Marble Bar may be among the hottest with a 10-day stint of 45C+ days possible, including 48C forecast for Saturday.) pic.twitter.com/M8v1gnToPV\n— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) December 28, 2023 Queensland’s energy supplies have also been hindered by the loss of the 66MW Barron Gorge hydro plant near Cairns, as a result of damage from cyclone Jasper and the subsequent deluge.\nThe heatwave in Queensland extends across much of northern Australia, with conditions expected to be severe in areas near Darwin and elsewhere in coming days, the bureau said.\nTemperatures topped 40C in Queensland, NSW, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, the bureau data showed.\nTowns such as Marble Bar, in Western Australia, may reach 48C on Saturday, according to bureau forecasts.\nThis would be the second hottest temperature recorded anywhere in Australia in 2023, trailing only the 49.3C recorded on 14 January at Onslow Airport, also in northwest WA.\nExplore more on these topics Energy Australia weather Queensland Western Australia news\nReuse this content",

The Bills are offering a free shuttle bus from McKinely Mall in Hamburg to the stadium, about 2 miles away. The No. 2 seed Bills (11-6) are 10-point favorites against the No. 7 seed Steelers (10-7). Bills fans who spoke to 13WHAM outside the stadium Monday morning were confident. \"I don't even think it's going to be close,\" Bills fan Adam Baghi said. \"The Bills are probably going to run up the score on the Steelers too.\" \"I'm pumped up,\" Bills fan Kevin Chang said. \"I'm fired up. I've been waiting for this all year. Let's get it, boys. Let's go!\" If the Bills win, they will advance to host the No. 3 seed Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round Sunday.

    "text": "[Malinowski](/user/Malinowski)a [jacobinlat.com](/go/link/3946777) [#108](c108#c-108) ha habido unos cuantos en la historia que no eran capitalistas. La Unión Soviética, por ejemplo, se cepilló el mar de Aral.\nChina está gastando una cantidad indecente de dinero en recuperarse de los errores cometidos en décadas pasadas\nPor poner dos ejemplos conocidos\nClaro que ahora me puedes decir que la Unión Soviética de Brehznev y la China de Mao eran capitalistas y entonces soy yo el que se ríe\nAsí que no, el calentamiento global no es responsabilidad exclusiva del capitalismo sino de la industrialización hecha de cualquier manera y sin mirar las consecuencias\n[#111](c111#c-111) Vale, diremos entonces que es culpa del sistema monetario y su mercado. Ahora le puedes llamar mercado capitalista, mercado comunista, mercado... Me da igual, el problema es el sistema monetario y su mercado.\n[#98](c98#c-98) Mientras exista una gran parte de la población que viva en la miseria, existirá la necesidad de repartir. En efecto, la soberbia de algunos de creerse merecedores de acaparar una gran parte de los recursos del mundo mientras una gran parte de la población del mismo a duras penas puede subsistir por falta de esos mismos recursos no conoce límites.\nJamás entenderé a la gente que ve esa situación de extrema desigualdad como algo positivo y necesario. Es un tipo de juicio moral que va completamente al revés de la ética más básica: considerar que la mayoría ha de sufrir y pasar hambre porque así han de ser las cosas y así ha de mantenerse la \"jerarquía natural\": que a muy pocos les sobre tanto que no sepan qué hacer con ello y a una enorme mayoría le falte tanto que esté desesperada por conseguir unas migajas, porque esa minoría \"es superior y merecedora\" y esa gran mayoría \"es inferior y merece su suerte\". Y considerar que mejorar la redistribución de los recursos es \"ir contra natura\" y \"subvertir el orden natural de las cosas\".\n[#114](c114#c-114) Pues porque la riqueza no viene dada. Parece que se nos olvida que la situación natural del ser humano es la pobreza más absoluta.\nO sea, el hecho de que tú tengas mucho y yo no tenga nada, no me da derecho a quitarte una parte. Porqué planteas la situación como que la riqueza estaba ahí, que solo había que cogerla, y que si uno tiene más que yo, es que se ha quedado mi parte. Y no, es un planteamiento totalmente equivocado.\n[#141](c141#c-141) El único escenario en el que veo que podrías tener razón es uno en el que los recursos fueran infinitos. Pero es que no vivimos en un mundo de recursos infinitos, los recursos de los que disponemos son limitados, así que el reparto de recursos es un juego de suma cero: para que uno tenga de sobra al otro necesariamente le tiene que faltar. Es un hecho matemático: si hay 100 recursos y 2 habitantes, para que uno tenga 80 el otro tiene que quedarse con 20. No podemos decir que \"es mentira, uno puede tener 80 y el otro también, solo que tiene que currárselo\" porque no hay más recursos, no se pueden inventar esos recursos y sacarlos de la nada. Por mucho que el otro \"se lo curre\" seguirá teniendo acceso únicamente a los 20 recursos que quedan. Porque no hay que confundir el sistema fiscal, en el que se puede sacar dinero de la nada con la realidad, es más, cuando el sistema fiscal genera dinero de la nada, también genera inflación a cambio. Siempre hay una contrapartida, no existen los recursos infinitos, aunque exista el dinero infinito. Recursos y dinero no son la misma cosa.\n[#144](c144#c-144) Los recursos se transforman, se trabajan y se genera valor añadido. Hay recursos que si no se explotan y se les aplica un trabajo, no valen de nada. Y ya no hablemos de una sociedad digitalizada como hoy en día, ¿que riqueza te están robando si es puramente intelectual?\nLa economía no es un juego de suma cero.\n[#81](c81#c-81)\nYo voy a comprar a una tienda, si nadie lleva alimentos a esa tienda no puedo vivir. Así que vivo del trabajo de otras personas.\nHay rico que no han trabajado en su vida y que simplemente viven de las rentas/herencia familiar.\nHay ricos que se dedica con un teléfono a comprar y vender algo y sacan unos beneficios con coste salarial cero.\nSi un autónomo contrata a un empleado el autónomo no es rico de por sí. Conozco autónomos que cobran menos que sus empleados si tenemos en cuentas SS y cotizaciones.\nInténtalo de nuevo.\nPropongo esto:\nEl rico es el que mediante rentas, comercio o a través de las plus valía del trabajo obtiene un lucro acumulado desproporcionado.\n[#74](c74#c-74) No. Eres simplemente un obrero mejor pagado pero a la que te quedes sin curro 3 meses acabas bajo un puente.\nAl ponerme a leerlo he visto que es considerablemente largo y me he impacientado. La gran ventaja que posee el capital (la derecha) sobre vosotros es que ellos en lugar de soltar todo ese rollo sueltan una idea chorra en una única frase. Y eso cala incluso entre los más tontos. Sin embargo todo vuestro texto solo será leído por una minoría.\nSi la gente hoy en día no lee ni los panfletos electorales. Enfrentáis libros contra ideas autocontenidas en una frase-gili.\nY aun así, no os creáis que tenéis el monopolio de los que tienen la paciencia de leer un libro. Por que para esos también están los \"rallos\" y los \"moas\" que aunque sus libros puedan estar repletos de chorradas, mentiras, inexactitudes e interpretaciones interesadas a ver quien está tan aburrido y sobrado de tiempo como para leer toda esa mierda.\nEl capitalismo se basa en la idea meritocrática de que cada uno recibe lo que le corresponde por su esfuerzo. Eso es una mentira\nEfectivamente, es una mentira repetida mil veces por los enemigos del libre mercado. El capitalismo se basa en el ahorro de capital y su inversión para el aumento de la productividad.\n[#69](c69#c-69) Y vuelta la burra al trigo con los ricos, veinte veces he dicho que no estoy hablando de ricos. La cuestión que te sirve para entender las dinámicas sociales es la relación con los medios de producción y la extracción de riqueza. Con eso como base, es fácil responderte tú mismo.\n[#117](c117#c-117) pero si eres tu el que quisiste hacer esa diferenciacion entre ricos y trabajadores...\nLa realidad es tan hetereogenea que no encaja en ninguno de tus postulados. Con decir que cualquier persona puede adquirir medios de produccion (acciones) e irlos ampliando con el tiempo.\n[#140](c140#c-140) ¿Y no ves incoherencia en lo que dices en [#39](c39#c-39)?\n¿No te das cuenta de que hoy en día no hay ningún problema en que cualquier asalariado pueda acceder a medios de producción bien sea con ahorros o a crédito?\nSi los asalariados no son dueños de medios de producción quizás no sea porque no puedan debido a que \"los ricos\" acaparen para ellos los medios de producción, sino porque quizás no les interese arriesgar capital y esfuerzos propios en una empresa que pueda llegar a ser rentable o no.\nIntuyo que eres asalariado, ¿qué te impide hacerte con medios de producción y hacerte empresario?\n[#148](c148#c-148) Bueno, quizás haya sido así históricamente, pero ya no podemos generalizar así cuando hay una comunidad científica tan grande gritando con datos para que se eche el freno. Ahora nos toca a nosotros arrimar el hombro para que podamos crear esa alternativa racional a la gestión de los recursos.\nYa lo decía yo, los ricachones de Pablo e Irene no merecen nada d elo que tienen por que lo han conseguido apropiándose del trabajo acumulado por los activistas y militantes de los movimientos sociales que han luchado a cambio de nada mientras que estos buscavidas han monetizado la lucha de tanta gente anónima apropiándose de su esfuerzo para convertirlo en sueldazos y sillones y tabernas y libros y todo aquello de lo que puedan lucrarse mientras por el camino dejan de lado las proclamas de los que dicen representar según van llenando sus carteras.\nNo deja de alucinarme que haya tantos pobres y precarios dejándose guiar por influencers millonarios que viven fuera de España o de políticos de la casta que viven en otra realidad, y mientras así sea no habrá nada que cambiar.\n[#110](c110#c-110) Principalmente. Y que aún siendo yo muy de izquierdas, descargar las responsabilidades de agotamiento de recursos con un simple la culpa es del capitalismo es falaz o bien ignorante, y he querido mostrar un ejemplo para ayudar al usuario a no volver a caer en ese error.\n[#113](c113#c-113) Si bien puede ser simplista, ahora mismo no hay ningún otro sistema que pueda haber causado el cambio climático. Que podemos ir a otros sistemas peores, claro... y mejores también! Pero es importante señalar que esto del cambio climático es causa de este sistema, para movernos hacia la alternativa cuanto antes.\n[#122](c122#c-122) Muy en desacuerdo.\nEl cambio climático es consecuencia del agotamiento de recursos, la evolución tecnológica y la contaminación de la industrialización, no del sistema capitalista pero se.\nLos datos que tenemos no apuntan a que un sistema no capitalista hubiera abordado el problema de otra manera, si no todo lo contrario (el ejemplo que he mencionado es válido).\nEl problema es la raza humana.\n[#124](c124#c-124) Los datos que tenemos dicen precisamente que los gobiernos y las democracias han sido incapaces de dominar a la bestia del mercado, y ha explotado recursos más rápido que su tasa de regeneración, sin posibilidad de haber impuesto límites, sin planificación, simplemente laissez faire impulsados por la dinámica natual del sistema de crear más y más para no entrar en depresión.\nClaro que es culpa del sistema de mercado, y que no puedas imaginar otros sistemas económicos racionales que tengan en cuenta los ecosistemas que nos mantienen con vida, no implica que el \"problema es la raza humana\". Y si tan claro lo tienes, ¿qué vas a hacer para solventarlo? ¿Suicidarte?\nLo siento que suene tan rudo, pero no puedo con el derrotismo.\n[#145](c145#c-145) Entiendo que me has malinterpretado, porque no planteo un derrotismo, si no que considero el agotamiento de recursos una inevitabilidad histórica, es algo completamente diferente.\nEl caso que he puesto del mar de Aral, es para ejemplificar que el único otro sistema de gobierno de masas que hemos conocido tampoco se ha preocupado mínimamente por el ecosistema, si no que también buscaba alcanzar cuotas de productividad a cualquier precio.\nLos datos que tenemos no dicen precisamente que los gobiernos y las democracias han sido incapaces de dominar a la bestia del mercado, lo que dicen es que el ser humano es un depredador de todo lo que tiene a su alcance.\n[#64](c64#c-64) Y esa gente, por norma general, son descendientes de ricos de hace siglos...\nNo es cierto:\nhttps://www.xataka.com/magnet/cada-nueva-generacion-tiene-dificil-superar-riqueza-sus-padres-este-grafico-ilustra\n[#133](c133#c-133) si claro pero has esquivado la cuestion. Ese ordenador de 800€ es totalmente inacessible para ser comprado por un trabajador y asi producir de forma autonoma?\n[#136](c136#c-136) En absoluto, un trabajador autónomo es prácticamente el ideal comunista, un trabajador que es propietario de sus medios de producción, en el comunismo los trabajadores son los peopietarios de los medios de produccion.\nEl problema viene cuando compras mas ordenadores/equipos y se los das a otros informáticos para que trabajen con ellos a cambio de un salario quedándote tu toda la diferencia entre el valor que ellos crean y su salario (Plusvalor).\n[#95](c95#c-95) En eso tienes razón. y es curioso con lo pijotero que soy yo con las definiciones no me había dado cuenta.\nRespecto al resto yo siempre he defendido la idea de que las ideas liberales \"de libro\" nunca se pondrá totalmente en práctica por que las grandes multinacionales necesitan a papa estado para cosas tales como las patentes, las subvenciones, etc.\nQue extraño, por un lado los obreros votan a la derecha a pesar de las izquierdas y por el otro lado las grandes empresas no son liberales y necesitan a papa estado.\nEs como estar enamorado de una mujer que folla con todo el mundo menos con ellos.\n[#40](c40#c-40) Por eso el rico no quiere que el pobre se pueda comprar un ferrari ni una mansión ni nada de lo que él compra porque el valor de sus lujos radica en la exclusividad pero estamos llegando a un punto en que hasta al rico le \"cuesta\" comprarse ciertas cosas y le molesta que el pobre pueda siquiera llegar a fin de mes, no sea que le vaya bien y ascienda a su esfera haciendole a él mas vulgar.\nSí, son un poco particulares.\nYo pienso que el problema está en la premisa:\n\"El capitalismo se basa en la idea meritocrática de que cada uno recibe lo que le corresponde por su esfuerzo.\"\nNo, eso no es cierto.\nEl capitalismo se basa en la idea de que la propiedad y el libre mercado regulado son la mejor forma de optimizar la producción y gestionar los recursos.\nLa economía planificada es mas rápida en ver lo evidente, pero es ciega a lo sutil, complejo, y desconocido. El libre mercado funciona siempre. A veces tarda mas en ajustarse, a veces menos.\nEl capitalismo no es un sistema justo, y buscar justicia en el solo puede llevar a decepción. El capitalismo es un sistema resiliente de gestión de los recursos y toma de decisiones en mercados desarrollados.\nEl capitalismo, para funcionar, requiere de un estado regulador que garantice la seguridad y luche contra la especulación, el monopolio y la usura. Sin eso, el capitalismo no funciona, colapsa.\nEl capitalismo jamás producirá un resultado de reparto justo, lo que pretende es:\n- resistir mucho a entornos cambiantes y complejos\n- optimizar la producción a costa de lo que sea (el único freno de esto es el estado)\nEn la práctica, no hay capitalismo en casi ningún sitio. Todos los estados son proteccionistas con sus grandes empresas, las cuales están fuertemente ligadas a los contratos públicos y a las subvenciones. El sistema en el que vivimos no tiene nombre (todavía), no se puede entender usando las gafas del siglo 20.\n[#107](c107#c-107) Pero si hay gente no rica que es dueña de medios de producción implica que la premisa \"los ricos son los dueños de los medios de producción\" es falsa...\n[#31](c31#c-31) Entonces un futbolista es clase trabajadora? Un actor de hollywood es clase trabajadora\nSi, son clase trabajadora, en terminología marxista se llama \"Aristocracia obrera\", aunque lo más probable es que teniendo tanto dinero rápidamente se apropian de medios de producción o renta por lo que mientras sigan trabajando serían ambas cosas, obreros y capitalistas (No son necesariamente ecluyentes).\n[#127](c127#c-127) me da que la terminología marxista se ha quedado anclada en el siglo XIX.\nEs como lo de los medios de produccion. Hoy en dia un ordenador de 800€ puede ser considerado un medio de produccion.\n[#97](c97#c-97) No existe la clase rica, existe la clase trabajadora y la clase burguesa/capitalista, el rentista entraría en esta última.\nClase rica-alta-media-baja son definiciones vagas y acientificas, siempre podrás encontrar ambigüedades, con la definición marxista no puedes equivocarte, lo más que puede pasar es que seas baja burguesía y todavía tengas que trabajar porque no has conseguido propiedad como para extraer suficiente valor sin necesidad de trabajar.\n[#135](c135#c-135) como que no puedes equivocarte? Acabas de meter al tio que realquila habitaciones en su piso por 800€/mes al mismo nivel que Jeff Bezos.\nAmbos viven de las rentas. Aunque me da que no al mismo nivel.\n[#137](c137#c-137) No, no los e puesto en el mismo nivel, los e puesto en la misma clase social, no es lo mismo.\nSi te cuesta ver la similitud es muy sencillo, ambos consiguen su dinero a costa de otros que trabajan para que ellos lo tengan sin tener que trabajar. Evidentemente Bezos lo hace a una escala infinitamente superior, pero es esencialmente lo mismo, la extracción de valor de otras personas.",

    "text": "A groundbreaking study recently presented at the prestigious World Vaccine Congress has shed new light on an intriguing intersection between infectious disease prevention and neurodegenerative health. The research, published in JAMA and led by principal investigator Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer of Stanford University, leverages a sophisticated quasi-experimental design to explore the causal relationship between herpes zoster vaccination and reduced risk of dementia. This investigation not only corroborates earlier findings from Wales but also expands the evidence base by examining a distinct population, thereby strengthening the assertion that herpes zoster immunization could play a preventive role against cognitive decline.\nDementia, characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, is a major public health challenge worldwide, with Alzheimer’s disease representing the most common subtype. Despite extensive research, effective preventative strategies remain elusive. Emerging evidence suggests that viral infections, including those caused by the herpes simplex virus family, may contribute to neuroinflammation and amyloid pathology, accelerating neurodegenerative processes. Given herpes zoster’s viral etiology—caused by varicella-zoster virus reactivation—the potential protective effects of vaccination against dementia represent an exciting frontier in preventive neurology.\nThis study stands out owing to its use of a quasi-experimental approach, which mitigates confounding factors that typically hamper observational studies. Unlike standard associational research, quasi-experiments approximate randomization by exploiting natural variations in vaccine eligibility or rollout timing. Such methodological robustness enhances the plausibility of inferring a causal link between vaccination and dementia risk reduction, moving beyond simple correlation. The research harnessed comprehensive health records and demographic data, enabling precise adjustment for potential confounders ranging from socioeconomic status to comorbidities.\nThe pathophysiological rationale underlying these findings is rooted in virology and immunology. Varicella-zoster virus is neurotropic and known to induce chronic inflammatory responses in nervous tissue after reactivation, often manifesting as shingles. This neuroinflammation is hypothesized to exacerbate or even initiate neurodegenerative changes. Vaccination against herpes zoster primes adaptive immunity, preventing viral reactivation and subsequent neural injury. Thus, immunization may indirectly mitigate the cascade of neuroinflammatory events thought to contribute to dementia pathogenesis.\nFindings from this study not only echo parallel results from Welsh populations but also extend their applicability. Replication in diverse demographic and healthcare settings is vital for establishing generalizability, a cornerstone of scientific rigor. The consistency across different cohorts reinforces the robustness of the association and bolsters the argument for herpes zoster vaccination as a modifiable factor in dementia prevention strategies.\nMoreover, the implications for public health policy are considerable. Dementia imposes enormous social and economic burdens globally, with costs projected to escalate as populations age. If herpes zoster vaccination can be broadly deployed to reduce dementia incidence, it may represent a valuable cost-effective intervention. The feasibility of integrating shingles vaccination into existing adult immunization schedules further amplifies its appeal, suggesting potential for immediate translational impact.\nHowever, it is critical to acknowledge the study’s limitations and the need for further investigation. While quasi-experimental designs strengthen causal inferences, they do not completely eliminate residual confounding. Randomized controlled trials, although challenging in this context, remain an ideal for definitive proof. Additionally, the mechanistic pathways linking vaccination and neuroprotection warrant deeper exploration through molecular and clinical research.\nThe research team has called for continued interdisciplinary collaboration to unravel the complex interplay between viral infections, immune responses, and neurodegeneration. Advanced neuroimaging, biomarker studies, and immunological profiling will be instrumental in delineating how herpes zoster vaccination modulates neural integrity over time. This multifaceted approach promises not only to validate current findings but also to uncover novel therapeutic targets.\nThis study represents a shining example of how leveraging epidemiological innovation can yield vital insights into preventive medicine. It challenges the traditional silos between infectious disease and neurology, suggesting that interventions previously regarded solely for infection control can have broader neurological benefits. Such paradigm shifts are critical as medicine moves toward integrative, system-wide perspectives on health and disease.\nThe unveiling of these findings at the World Vaccine Congress ensures that they will reach a global audience of vaccine researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. It paves the way for informed discussions on revising vaccination guidelines and prioritizing research funding. By demonstrating a tangible link between herpes zoster vaccination and cognitive health, the study injects fresh momentum into the ongoing quest to prevent dementia.\nUltimately, this research may herald a new chapter in dementia prevention, where vaccines serve dual purposes: protecting against infectious diseases and preserving cognitive function. The possibility of reducing the global dementia burden through enhanced immunization strategies is an exciting and hopeful development, one that merits enthusiastic attention from the scientific community and public health authorities alike.\nContact details for Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer have been provided for media inquiries, and the full text of the study will soon be accessible through embargoed media channels. JAMA continues to support transparent and timely dissemination of high-impact research findings, fostering informed dialogue and evidence-based policymaking.\nAs this research circulates, it is expected to stimulate further scholarly inquiry and invigorate advocacy efforts for expanded adult vaccination programs. The interplay between viral suppression and neuroprotection may well be one of the most promising avenues in the fight against dementia, offering hope grounded in rigorous science.\nSubject of Research : The potential causal relationship between herpes zoster vaccination and reduced risk of dementia.\nArticle Title : [Information not provided in the content]\nNews Publication Date : [Information not provided in the content]\nWeb References : [Embargoed media link not available]\nReferences : doi:10.1001/jama.2025.5013\nImage Credits : [Not specified]\nKeywords : Herpes simplex, Dementia, Vaccination, Population studies\nTags: Alzheimer’s disease and viral infectionscognitive decline prevention strategiesemerging evidence in preventive neurologyherpes zoster vaccination and dementia riskinfectious disease prevention and cognitive healthneurodegenerative disease preventionprotective effects of vaccination against dementiapublic health and dementia researchquasi-experimental design in health researchvaccine impact on neurodegenerative diseasesvaricella-zoster virus and neuroinflammationWorld Vaccine Congress research findings",

    "text": "In view of the shocking situation in Palestine, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Thursday said that the government of Pakistan has completely banned all kinds of events regarding the New Year celebrations to express solidarity with the oppressed Palestinians. In a special televised message, he urged the general public to show solidarity with the oppressed people of Gaza and observe simplicity at the beginning of the New Year. PM Kakar said the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah were deeply saddened by the massacre of the oppressed Palestinians, especially the innocent children, and the genocide of innocent Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. “Since October 7, 2023, more than 21,000 innocent Palestinians have been martyred due to the brutality of the Israeli forces, including a large number of innocent children, which has reached around 9,000,” the prime minister remarked. He said that to stop the Israeli bloodshed, Pakistan had raised its voice for the oppressed Palestinians at every forum of the world and it would always continue to speak in future as well. The prime minister pointed out that Pakistan had sent two consignments of relief goods to help its Palestinian brothers and sisters, while the third consignment was also being sent soon. Likewise, he said that the government of Pakistan was in close contact with Egypt and Jordan for timely relief of the Palestinians, evacuation of the injured from Gaza and their treatment. The prime minister prayed to Allah Almighty that the sun of the New Year may rise with the message of peace, prosperity and harmony for Pakistan and the rest of the world. The Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that the recorded toll in the enclave was 21,110 killed and 55,243 wounded in barbaric Israeli attacks. Nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes. Israel retaliated to Hamas’ October 7 attack with a relentless bombardment and a siege followed by a ground invasion. Since the siege went into effect, Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been suffering severe shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine, with only limited aid entering the territory. An estimated 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN.",
