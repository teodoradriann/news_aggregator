    "text": "13 Things Parents Say That Make Teachers LOL Introduction: Being a teacher is a rewarding and challenging profession. Throughout their careers, teachers come across various types of parents who offer different levels of support and engagement. Sometimes, they hear things from parents that are guaranteed to make them chuckle. Here’s a list of 13 things parents say that make teachers LOL. 1. “My child never lies.” Sure, every parent wants to believe their child is a little angel who would never fib. However, teachers know better that all kids can stretch the truth from time to time. 2. “My child does all their homework but just forgets to turn it in.” Of course, no parent wants to think their child is slacking off. But when this becomes a habit, it’s hard for teachers not to have a little laugh. 3. “You should give less homework so my child has more time for extracurricular activities.” While it’s essential for students to have a balanced life outside the classroom, balancing academics with other activities is also important. 4. “My child doesn’t need extra help; they’re just lazy.” Some parents assume that if their child isn’t excelling, it’s because they aren’t trying hard enough. Teachers know there may be other factors at play and are always willing to provide extra support when needed. 5. “I don’t understand why my child failed the test; I did all the homework with them.” Parents can help children stay on track with assignments, but sometimes this support goes too far, crossing into doing the work for them. 6. “Can you plan a field trip to Disneyland?” While educational field trips can be fun and engaging, teachers have to be practical when selecting school outings. 7. “Why can’t my child choose what subjects they want to learn?” The curriculum exists for a reason – there are certain core subjects that must be taught to ensure a well-rounded education. 8. “Why weren’t any of my kid’s friends invited to be in the gifted program?” The gifted program has specific criteria, and it’s not about maintaining friendships. Teachers are simply following the guidelines when they make recommendations for these programs. 9. “My child never does anything wrong at home.” No child is perfect, and teachers know that children can often behave differently in a school setting than they do at home. 10. “You must not like my child because they never get A’s.” Teachers have no reason to single out any particular student when grading assignments or tests. Their main priority is providing a fair assessment of the child’s performance. 11. “Can you call me every day with updates on my child’s progress?” While teachers appreciate parental involvement, calling every day would be impractical and unmanageable. Regularly scheduled conferences or emails are more conducive to an open dialogue. 12. “Why did you become a teacher if you don’t like kids?” Believe it or not, the majority of teachers love working with children! It’s important for parents to remember that constructive criticism and feedback do not equate to disliking a child. 13. “Can you tutor my child for free after school?” Teachers genuinely want to see their students succeed but asking them to volunteer extra hours without pay is unrealistic and unreasonable. Conclusion: Teachers strive to create positive relationships with both students and their parents, working together to grow academically and personally. It’s essential for parents and teachers to maintain open communication and work through any misunderstandings for the benefit of their shared goal – the success of the student. But if these quotes from parents have taught us anything, it’s that there can still be some humor found in navigating this complex relationship!",

    "title": "Scams to avoid when visiting Rome - Wanted in Rome",
    "text": "As one of the world’s most beautiful and intriguing cities, Rome consistently attracts millions of tourists every year. But with such a large number of visitors to the city each month, there are always some business owners, hawkers and petty criminals keen to exploit foreigners’ naivety for financial gain. While most people and businesses are honest and welcoming to tourists, there are a few scams to look out for during your stay in the Eternal City. Tourist-only restaurants [Easily identifiable by their red-and-white checked tablecloths and plates of plastic food lingering next to the English-only menus, these restaurants purely target tourists and should be avoided.Most of these restaurants, with some exceptions of course, are located tantalisingly close to Rome’s major sites – the Colosseum, the Spanish Steps, the Vatican, the Trevi Fountain and other famous areas of interest.](/i/preview/storage/uploads/2019/07/Tourist-only_restaurants.jpg) While walking down the street, you will hear the restaurant before you see it, as the waiting staff will be lining the streets, trying to usher you inside. Any restaurant worth their salt in Rome will be far too busy to waste time convincing you to eat there. In fact, you will probably either have to book a table in advance or wait patiently outside until a coveted spot becomes free. Due to their splendid locations in the shadows of Rome’s hotspots, the owners of these restaurants pay sky-high rent. This is, of course, reflected in the quality of the food. After all, who can afford sky-high rent and top quality ingredients at the same time? This often results in poor quality fare disguised as authentic Roman classic dishes like carbonara and amatriciana. No Italian would be caught dead eating at one of these tacky establishments. Do a little research and explore the backstreets to uncover some hidden culinary gems. Kiosks [Like the tourist-only restaurants, these kiosks are usually found near major tourist sites.On very hot days exploring the city, they can seem like an oasis in the desert, offering bottled water, fruit, snacks and iced drinks to thirsty travellers.](/i/preview/storage/uploads/2019/07/Kiosks.jpg) But these kiosks can charge extortionate prices – even asking as much as five euros for a small bottle of water in some cases, which should cost between 50 cents to one euro. Again, all the menus will be in English only – the absence of Italian being a sure sign of a scam. ‘Gifts’ on the street [If a hawker spots you and identifies you as a tourist, soon enough he or she will be winging their way towards you to shake your hand, make small talk, then offer you a gift of a bracelet, necklace or small ornament.Do not accept these ‘gifts’ – once you have taken them you will be pestered to make a donation or buy more goods, or the seller might even become increasingly hostile towards you. This is a standard trick on the streets to guilt you into parting with your cash for a piece of junk you don’t want.](/i/preview/storage/uploads/2019/07/Ambulanti_roma.jpg) The same applies to the hordes of flower-sellers pushing bunches of roses in your face on the street or sometimes even inside bars and restaurants. Just ignore their persistence, give a firm ‘no’ and walk away. Pickpockets [Like any major city, Rome has its fair share of pickpockets on the streets and riding public transport, particularly at Termini station.A common trick is for small groups, often teenage girls, to barge into you while getting on or off a bus, train or metro, before another grabs your belongings and scarpers.](/i/preview/storage/uploads/2019/07/Pickpockets_rome-3.jpg) Just keep your eyes peeled, your valuables locked in a safe if possible, your bags closed and close and your wallet carefully concealed. Gelato [Italy is famous for its delicious gelato. But sadly, not all ice-cream is created equal. In fact, some outlets do not produce traditional gelato at all – it is made with a synthetic powder mix.](/i/preview/storage/uploads/2019/07/carapina-gelato-rome.jpg) The best way to tell real gelato from fake is to look at the colours, quantities and flavours on display. If you see neon green pistachio instead of a more brownish hue of green, avoid. And if the gelateria boasts flavours like bubblegum and raspberry ripple, in huge whipped heaps in aluminium trays, these are best dodged in favour of a smaller outlet serving quality artisanal produce. by Catherine Evans",

    "text": "La Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (Conmebol) ha hecho un llamado urgente al Ministerio Público para que se pronuncie sobre un presunto caso de lavado de dinero. La denuncia apunta al ex presidente de la Conmebol, Nicolás Leoz, quien supuestamente habría transferido fondos de la entidad a cuentas bancarias a través de un fideicomiso gestionado por un banco local. En el marco de esta denuncia, la Conmebol ha instado a la Fiscalía a tomar acciones concretas respecto a las investigaciones relacionadas con presunto lavado de dinero durante la gestión de Nicolás Leoz, quien falleció en 2019. Esta situación también involucra al banco Atlas en el proceso. El abogado de la asociación, Claudio Lovera, ha destacado la complejidad de las investigaciones, pero ha señalado que los fiscales encargados ya deberían contar con los elementos necesarios para llevar el caso a los tribunales. La Conmebol espera que esta vez las investigaciones no se vean afectadas por la inacción, como ha ocurrido en el pasado. Ya en 2017, la Conmebol presentó una denuncia similar que no tuvo el avance esperado debido al fallecimiento de Nicolás Leoz. Según las auditorías forenses realizadas durante la gestión de Alejandro Domínguez, se descubrieron irregularidades que perjudicaron a la Conmebol, incluyendo el desvío de más de USD 28 millones a cuentas vinculadas a Leoz. Aunque la denuncia se presentó en 2021, la Conmebol no ha recibido actualizaciones sobre el estado de las investigaciones llevadas a cabo por los fiscales Francisco Cabrera, Alma Zayas y Jorge Arce. El abogado también ha criticado la actuación del banco, que habría realizado un fideicomiso en contravención a las normativas sobre lavado de dinero. Este fideicomiso se habría llevado a cabo con una persona sujeta a solicitud de extradición a Estados Unidos por presunto lavado de dinero.

    "text": "By Matthew Hubbard ,\n6 hours ago Senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin, along with every member of the senate supported a resolution to honor the life, legacy and memory of former Oklahoma Senator, Jim Inhofe.\n“Senator Inhofe was a remarkable father, husband, brother, friend, mentor, and an accomplished United States Senator with an exemplary record of service to the state of Oklahoma,” said Lankford. “Our resolution cements his legacy into the written history of the Senate to ensure future generations know his many contributions to our state and nation, particularly for our military and veterans. Cindy and I join Senator Inhofe’s family, friends, former staff, and the entire Senate to officially recognize the many debts our state and nation owe to the service of James Mountain Inhofe.”\nInhofe served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives for three years and the Oklahoma State Senate for eight years. After an unsuccessful campaign for governor and Congress, he served three terms as Tulsa's mayor.\nHe then served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1987-1994, before resigning and serving in the U.S. Senate from 1994 to 2023 before his retirement.\nSen. Jim Inhofe gives farewell speech to fellow senators On July 9, just days after the Fourth of July weekend, Inhofe passed away from an unexpected illness.\nHe passed peacefully with his wife Kay holding his hand, surrounded by his kids Molly, Jimmy, and Katy. His son Perry died in a plane crash in 2013.\nREMEMBERING INHOFE: Look back at the former senator's legacy The senators were joined by their colleagues to honor Inhofe, who was Oklahoma's longest-serving US Senator and his long career in public service.\n“Senator Jim Inhofe was a mountain of a man and someone we could all learn from,” said Mullin. “His legacy will be long-lasting in Oklahoma and in the halls of Congress. May we always strive to serve our state with the tenacity and values of God and Country that Senator Inhofe held so dear. It’s an honor to join my colleagues in officially recognizing Senator Inhofe’s life of service and his contributions to our great state.”\nMore from 2 News Oklahoma\nAmerican Airlines and Tulsa Tech add new partnership for maintenance base Emma Burch\n6:48 PM, Jul 11, 2024\nU.S. Senate honors former Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe after his passing Matthew Hubbard\n6:14 PM, Jul 11, 2024\nLaw aims to prevent inappropriate communication between teachers, students Clifton Haskin\n6:08 PM, Jul 11, 2024\nNEIGHBORS SAY NO: Community against new homeless shelter near Mohawk Park Stef Manchen\n5:45 PM, Jul 11, 2024",

    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.
