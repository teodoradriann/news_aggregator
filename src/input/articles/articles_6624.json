    "text": "Holidaymakers aiming to hit slopes in Italy and France are facing disappointment\nHolidaymakers aiming to hit the slopes in Italy and France are facing disappointment as the warmest December in Italy in 130 years and heavy rain in the French Alps threaten to wipe out the ski season.\nItaly’s northern region of Piedmont, experiencing its warmest December since the 1890s, has seen winter resorts shutting down runs due to a lack of snow.\nBardonecchia, a popular resort near the French border, has been particularly affected by a high-pressure weather system, with temperatures reaching as high as 16C in the depths of December.\nResorts in the Apennine mountains outside Rome, including Terminillo and Ovindoli, have also faced challenges with inadequate snow cover, leading to the closure of slopes despite busy Christmas bookings.\nMeanwhile in France, the popular resorts of Morzine and Les Gets were forced to delay the opening of the ski season due to monsoon like downpours, with temperatures not cold enough to precipitate proper snowfall.\nThough some light powder was dusted on the slopes in recent days, more rain is expected to overrun the slopes.\nThe disappointing conditions come after Spanish meteorologists warned that December temperatures across much of Western and Southern Europe would be far higher than normal.\nRuben del Campo, a spokesperson for Spain’s national weather agency, said earlier this month that the unseasonable heat, coupled with predictions of sparse rainfall until the end of February, heralded a ‘not very good’ season for winter sports that depend on abundant snow, which once melted is also a crucial water resource for the spring and summer months.\nBardonecchia, a popular resort near the French border, has been particularly affected by a high-pressure weather system, with temperatures reaching as high as 16C in the depths of December\nLes Gets Ski Slope 29/12/23\nTerminillo Ski Slope 29/12/23\nLe Plateau de Nyon, Morzine Ski Slope 29/12/23\nTemperatures across Spain in mid-December smashed records, pushing the mercury close to 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) in the south and delaying the start of the ski season.\nAnd several regions of Italy normally ripe for skiing at this time of year have been far warmer than usual as temperatures in the Alpine city of Turin crested 20C the week before Christmas.\nEnrico Rossi, director of the ski lift company Colomion and vice-president of the Bardonecchia tourism consortium, admitted that there was not enough snow to open all the slopes.\n‘During this period last year, we had four more [slopes] open. We have given priority to the beginner slopes, making artificial snow for them. We are postponing the opening of the difficult ones, which are also the least crowded,’ he told The Telegraph.\nLuca Mercalli, president of the Italian Meteorological Society, attributed the rise in temperatures to global warming and warned of a grim outlook for Alpine regions, saying the temperatures he had seen in December were akin to those expected in late summer.\n‘The continuous increase in temperatures due to global warming will cause a further reduction in the winter season in the future, with more rain and less snow even at high altitudes.\n‘In the days before Christmas, to find zero degrees celsius you had to go up to almost 3,000 metres [9,900ft] and these are temperatures we normally find in late summer,’ he added.\nSunset time in the Italian Alps, view of the town of Bardonecchia, Piedmont\nFILE: A low-angle action shot of skiing action in the French ski resort of Morzine, in the European Alps\nIt comes after higher temperatures and adverse weather conditions wrought havoc on the skiing World Cup in early December.\nRainfall in the French Alps forced the cancellation of six races.\nSharing a statement on December 10, t he International Ski and Snowboard Federation said the men’s slalom – one of the centrepieces of the World Cup – could not start ‘due to the present slope conditions after last night’s rain and snow to ensure the safety and fairness for the racers.’\nThe scheduled start time already was pushed back Saturday in anticipation of course workers needing more time to clear the snow and ensure parts of the run which had been lashed by rain were safe to ski on.\nThe race likely will be rescheduled at a different venue later in the season.",

    "text": "El móvil no se libra de la suciedad ni tampoco del polvo y, al igual que ocurre con un coche, hay que limpiarlo de vez en cuando para mantenerlo en un perfecto estado. En un vehículo puede ser más bien una necesidad estética, pero en el caso de un smartphone resulta imprescindible para mantener un rendimiento óptimo. En las redes sociales he encontrado miles de usuarios que brindan ayuda a los usuarios con métodos para limpiar el teléfono algo arriesgados, aunque este se lleva el premio gordo y ni por asomo recomendamos hacer uso de esta práctica.\nTikTok y otras redes sociales provocan que muchos vídeos se vuelvan virales, ya sea un meme, una canción, trucos para el móvil o formas de quitarle el polvo de dentro. Gran parte de los usuarios hacen caso a lo que dicen personas que no conocen de nada y sin comprobar previamente si el método que emplean es recomendable, ya que en algunas ocasiones puedes llegar a dañar el dispositivo todavía más.\nDeja la silicona quieta\nUn vídeo se ha hecho tendencia en Twitter (conocida como X en la actualidad) debido a la forma de limpiar el móvil que muestra un usuario en la aplicación. El truco que se emplea para sacar la suciedad del puerto USB es muy peligroso y por esta misma razón recomendamos alejarse todo lo posible de esta alternativa.\nTendencias en Argentina@porqueTTarg«USB»:\nPor esta particular manera de limpiar el puerto de carga de un celular.\nhttps://t.co/fQ7isFg3qY05 de junio, 2024 • 16:59\n2.1K\n16\nLo que hace el usuario es meter silicona líquida en el puerto USB y utilizar una varilla de metal para extenderlo e introducirla mejor. Esto sin sacar en ningún momento la vara de la silicona para que, posteriormente, cuando se solidifique el material, tirar hacia arriba de la vara para extraer la silicona y con ella toda la suciedad del puerto pegada.\nEn el vídeo parece extremadamente fácil y una forma rápida de limpiar el puerto del móvil, pero la realidad es que resulta extremadamente peligroso usar esta clase de materiales en el dispositivo y mucho más peligroso introducirlos en su interior. Nunca hagas caso a los vídeos virales que aparecen por Internet, ya que muchos de ellos solo buscan ser populares sin preocuparse lo más mínimo por las consecuencias que pueda tener.\nCómo limpiar el móvil bien\nEsta clase de publicaciones suelen estar orquestadas y preparadas previamente, una muestra de ello es la cantidad de suciedad que tiene el puerto USB en su interior y que parece una pelusa de gran tamaño. La silicona puede dejar restos, quedar incrustada o que al extraerse se lleve consigo alguna parte interna del dispositivo, así que mejor mantente alejado de esta forma viral de limpiar el smartphone.\nTe estarás preguntando entonces ¿cómo se limpia el puerto USB del móvil? Pues el método más simple y efectivo que recomendamos es utilizar un spray de aire comprimido junto a un bastoncillo o alfiler, aunque con mucho cuidado de no dañar el interior. Trata de ser delicado y cuidadoso para no dañar por dentro el teléfono o te encontrarás con que el dispositivo no carga correctamente más tarde. No te llevará demasiado tiempo y no implica apenas complicación, así que deja de hacer caso a todos los vídeos que te encuentras por Internet.",

    "title": "Moment Storm Gerrit tornado batters quiet street: Locals describe trees toppling 'like dominoes' as cleanup continues after 'whirlwind of madness' | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "A tornado which left a trail of destruction through a town during Storm Gerrit has been described as a 'whirlwind of madness'. Greater Manchester Police declared a major incident on Wednesday night after a supercell thunderstorm hit the Tameside town of Stalybridge. The tornado damaged 100 homes, sent trees toppling 'like dominoes' and wrote off cars as flying debris caused major structural damage while residents hid under their duvets. CCTV released by local residents appears to show the moment a quiet street was battered by Storm Gerrit, with debris seen flying through the air before a roof tile impales the bonnet of a BMW car. Others have shared footage from within their homes, with fine glass seen shattered across furniture in living rooms after windows were smashed in by the storm. Stalybridge resident Kerry Hogan described the tornado as 'bedlam', while another family feared they were going to die. Ms Hogan told BBC Radio 5 Live that the tornado 'lasted a minute, 90 seconds, literally a whirlwind of madness' and it 'sounded horrendous'. 'We couldn't open the front door as the wind was that bad,' she said. 'Lamp-posts were swaying, we watched trees topple like dominoes. All the neighbours were out, it was bedlam. * Hit by the tornado? Please email your photos to: tom.pyman@mailonline.co.uk * Damaged houses are seen in the Stalybridge area of Greater Manchester People after a 'localised tornado' ripped off roofs CCTV (pictured)) released by local residents appears to show the moment a quiet street was battered by Storm Gerrit, with debris seen flying through the air and a roof tile impaling the bonnet of a BMW car Footage from inside a home shows the level of destruction, with glass shattered everywhere A fallen tree strikes a car in Stalybridge after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc across the UK 'People have had cars crushed. It was horrific and how nobody has been hurt is unbelievable.' As well as Stalybridge being struck by a 'localised tornado', Scotland was also battered by Storm Gerrit, leading to a major Met Office backlash. The UK's weather service issued yellow warnings, suggesting there was a low chance of severe impacts from the storm which sparked travel chaos with 80mph winds, blizzards and heavy rain. The Met Office has been challenged over whether amber alerts should have been issued - and has pledged to conduct a review. Maisie Pilkington, another local resident who was impacted by the storm's tornado in Tameside, told of the moment a tree crashed into her home as she slept. 'I opened the door and thought 'oh my God',' she told the BBC . 'The tree's hit the roof and gone through my bathroom. 'The whole ceiling of my bathroom is down, the tree's in the bathroom and the whole tree is being held up by one branch.' One couple has shared footage of the moment the tornado hit Stalybridge. Craig and Karen Sanderson were away at the time but came back to find their home and car had been badly damaged. 'We came back and the house was in wrack and ruin. We have severe roof damage - we have lost 50 to 60 tiles at the front and back of the house,' Mr Sanderson told Manchester Evening News. 'The car is damaged, the bonnet, all down the side, the windscreen. The hole in the bonnet you can put your fist through it.' He added that one of the chairs they keep on a mini balcony ended up in someone's garden 15 doors down the street. Mr Sanderson said that around 50 per cent of homes had been damaged around his home in the 'epicentre' of the tornado. Denise Burrows Devine's entire window unit in her front bedroom was blown clean through by the tornado and crashed onto the carpet at Stalybridge in Greater Manchester Denise Burrows Devine, 65, and her dog Casper both had a miraculous escape in Stalybridge The front of Ms Devine's home is pictured.

Gareth and Lyndsey Moody had a lucky escape as they scrambled to safety with their three children after the tornado struck while they were in bed. Lyndsey, an A&E nurse, told the Mirror: 'We were lucky to get out alive. We could be dead. The house started shaking. I went to the window, it was like it was sucking in and out. The whole ceiling came down.' Residents described how Storm Gerrit turned streets into 'warzones' - with a grandmother revealing a window was blown into her house. Denise Burrows Devine, 65, and her dog Casper both had a miraculous escape when the entire window unit in her front bedroom was blown clean through and crashed onto the carpet as a supercell thunderstorm hit Stalybridge. Homeowners were told to attend a town hall for help, and the Met Office revealed there had been a strong rotating updraft and it was 'likely' that a tornado had hit. Greater Manchester Police confirmed officers were called to 'numerous reports of significant damage' at about 11.45pm on Wednesday and declared a 'major incident'. Photographs showed walls blown over, roofs torn apart and windows blown out. Among those affected was grandmother-of-four Ms Devine and her pet Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Ms Devine told MailOnline: 'Thankfully I was at my daughter's when it happened because where the window fell is exactly where Casper normally sleeps. 'I always put him in his cage downstairs when I go out, but I dread to think what would have happened to both of us if I'd been in bed. 'I have extra thick glass because I'm on a main road and it gets noisy, so the window unit weighs a ton and it didn't smash. Here is the weather forecast for the next few days from Meteogroup UK: Today : A few light showers are expected throughout tomorrow, becoming moderate at times in northern England. Sleet and snow across northern Scotland. Clearer for South East England and the Midlands, with spells of sunshine in the morning and afternoon. There will be fresh westerly winds alongside. Saturday : A good deal of heavy rain on Saturday, turning heavy at times over South West England and Wales, and wintry over northern England. Moderate winds. Sunday (New Year's Eve): Patchy cloud and scattered showers on Sunday, wintry in the North. Turning clearer through the evening in the South. Strong winds along the South Coast 'Casper's an old dog, he's 12 and not in the best health, so he wouldn't have stood a chance. It would have crushed him. It doesn't bear thinking about. Someone must be looking over me. 'My neighbour rang me and said 'There's been a tornado, you'd better come home.' I thought he was pulling my leg, I couldn't believe we could get a tornado here in Stalybridge. 'My daughter drove me straight over and we could barely get down my street, there were trees down everywhere and bits of rubble in the road. I literally just screamed when we pulled up outside my house and I saw the damage. 'When I saw the state of my bedroom I was totally horrified. I've just finished getting the house renovated but my bed is ruined and so is the carpet. 'The wind and rain just blew straight in. My bedroom's basically been annihilated. Part of my conservatory roof has been blown off and there are roof tiles everywhere. 'At least the house itself has stayed in one piece, unlike some of the newer ones around here. It was built in 1888 so they knew how to build them nice and solidly.' Relatives rallied around to start the clear-up overnight, and by 5am the window was back in place, enabling her to spend the rest of the night in a spare room. 'The town looked like a warzone this morning,' the widower said. 'It's just a miracle that no-one has been badly hurt. For people to go through having their homes trashed like this just a few days after Christmas is horrendous, I feel so sorry for them. 'Thankfully my insurers have been great, they're sending someone round tomorrow to assess the damage.' Another local resident Andy Turner told MailOnline: 'At 11.30pm last night, there was - all I can describe - is a hurricane came through. It lasted for about 15 seconds. 'Cars were parked outside the house. My wife's car is a write off, my car's took a bit of the brunt of the tree. It's just lucky that nobody was hurt. It was pure carnage.' Dominic Halford, 47, an entertainer, lives on Calico Crescent in Carrbrook, a village to the east of Stalybridge which was one of the worst affected locations.

I thought my windows were going to go through - I pulled the duvet on top of myself in case they smashed. 'Then as quickly as it had swept in, it had gone again. I looked out at the tail end of it and there were wheelie bins rolling around the road as the wind whipped through. 'All the neighbours came out into the street, lots of people were in their dressing gowns - we couldn't believe the damage to some of the houses. 'Everyone was in shock, lots of people's cars had been smashed up by the debris. Thankfully I've just lost some roof tiles, but some people in the street have been really badly affected.' Just five years ago, 30 homes on the same street and nearby roads were evacuated when massive moorland fires threatened to engulf the neighbourhood. On that occasion it was saved when the wind changed direction at the last minute. The area is thought to have been the last built-up area struck by the track of the tornado before it swept into the surrounding hills. Fellow Stalybridge resident Alan Lake described hearing 'this almighty roar', adding: 'It sounded like a plane was 10ft above the roof. I saw lightning.

After it had died down, he went outside to find the splintered remains of his garden pergola. 'The roof is the biggest worry, if look at it from outside you see the roof tiles have lifted,' he said. 'In comparison to other people, we were lucky.' Hayley McCaffer, who lives with her partner in Carrbrook, said that they have been 'fairly lucky' compared with some of their neighbours. Ms McCaffer, 40, said: 'Some of the neighbours' houses are an absolute disaster - the roof missing, gable ends gone, cars squished with all the stone that's come off the houses. Luckily for us, very luckily, we were in the pub last night when it happened. 'We weren't here, but also we had parked our car there and looking at the state of our driveway - one of the walls has come down - we were very lucky that it wasn't parked there because it would have not been in a good state today.' She said she was alerted to the 'tornado' by a phone call from her mother, who lives locally and whose roof was partially ripped off by winds before parts landed on her car.

'It was dark so we could see big piles of debris and people's bits of houses missing,' she said. Ms McCaffer and her partner were 'evacuated' and remain unsure when they will be able to get back into their home. 'But we were safe and that was the main thing,' she added. 'We've got insurance, hopefully that will be covered. And, you know, when things like this happen, there's lots of people who are worse off than us, so we can't really complain too much.' Patricia Watkinson, who also lives in Carrbrook, was away in Norfolk when gusts swept through the village but was told by a neighbour that apart from a 'dangling' aerial her home appears undamaged. The 83-year-old said: 'I'm glad I wasn't there. My neighbour, she just rang me, and her shed is gone and the fence is gone. Hopefully, all that is wrong with mine is the aerial dangling.' Another resident, Alison Atkinson, told BBC Radio Manchester it was unprecedented, saying: 'There's trees down everywhere, the roads are closed, trying to get up here.

There's two guys up there trying to clear all the trees up now. The lane's completely blocked off. The pavements are all ripped up. Never seen anything like this, really haven't.' Andy Wareham, whose Tesla windscreen was smashed, said he heard 'extremely loud wind noises', telling the Manchester Evening News : 'Things started flying around, roof tiles knocking off. There was about 30 seconds to a minute of chaos and then it calmed down and straight away I was like, 'it must have been a tornado'.' And Richard Harrison, whose car window was also destroyed by flying debris, told the newspaper: 'It was just lucky no one was killed. You can see the strength with that wedged in the back. It was a good job no one was walking down the street.' Matthew Marsland, who lives opposite houses that were badly damaged, told the M.E.N.: 'I just heard an extreme noise at my back window. I was stood at the patio doors and there was basically a crazy sounding noise and then vibrations through the glass.' Dozens of locals were advised to stay inside 'due to the severity of the damage caused and potential risk to public safety'. Shocking pictures showed houses with gaping holes in their roofs while dozens of cars were battered by falling bricks, trees and debris. Residents told of their shock as they woke up to find their homes and cars wrecked in the aftermath of the storm. Rachael Jones, 44, who lives on Granville Street in Millbrook, said: 'I was in bed last night, and it just sounded like it was a really bad hailstorm. I could just hear lots of things flying about, I just stayed in bed because I was so scared.

All the slates off the roofs of my house were off, chimneys down the street have come off, my car's been written off and all the aerials are down, it's unbelievable.' Another resident said: 'I was woken in the night by some huge bangs. At first I thought a house must have exploded or maybe a plane had come down. 'When I looked out my window in the morning I couldn't believe it. All the cars parked down my road were covered in bricks and had smashed windows. 'The house at the end of the street had had the gable end torn off and you could see right inside their loft. The force of the wind was just unreal.' On the same street a tree which smashed through a roof caused some residents to be evacuated by the emergency services. Local Graham Yates, 50, said: 'There was a tree outside that must be at least 70 or 80 years old but it was literally torn out by its roots. 'The tornado caught most people by surprise. You heard the word storm but never expect to wake up the next morning to see carnage outside. 'My neighbour's garden literally had five people's wheelie bins in it. They'd just blown right over the wall. I'm amazed no one was hurt or worse. If anyone had been stupid enough to be outside at midnight they'd have been toast.'

Officers declared it as a major incident 'due to the severity of the damage caused and potential risk to public safety'. Over in Millbrook, several large trees fell into roads and onto cars. Electricity North West and Tameside Council were also involved in the response, and police told 'displaced' residents to visit Dukinfield Town Hall for help and advice. Police said they were working with North West Ambulance Service and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, but 'there have thankfully been no injuries reported'. Authorities in Greater Manchester were also called to weather incidents amid reports of a possible tornado in Dukinfield and Mossley last night. Councillor Dave Sweeten from Tameside Council told the Manchester Evening News: 'We must have been just on the periphery of the route. I've lived at the top of the hill for about 50 years. 'Never heard any winds like it. It woke me up, I couldn't get back to sleep. Started looking at the council website and internet and all my emails - realised there was a major incident.'

This is not what anybody needs. Scotland has been badly hit, we've been badly hit.' One resident told the newspaper that the noise was 'like a bomb going off'. Tameside Council said about 100 homes were evacuated after the 'mini tornado' hit areas of Carrbrook and Millbrook. A spokesperson said: 'It is believed everyone affected made arrangements to stay with family and friends overnight. 'Our officers have been out all night and continue to be out today clearing debris, fallen trees and making roads, footpaths and other areas safe.' The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation said a detailed site investigation would be undertaken before it can confirm the damage was caused by a rare British tornado. Chief Superintendent Mark Dexter from Greater Manchester Police said: 'This incident has undoubtedly affected numerous people in the Stalybridge area with many residents displaced from their properties during the night.

'I would also like to urge members of the public to avoid the area where possible and take extra care when travelling in vehicles on the roads in Stalybridge and the surrounding areas, due to debris in the road. 'This has understandably caused some disruption and, though we are not yet in a position to confirm when the area will return to normal, further updates will be communicated when we have them. I would like to use this opportunity to thank the community for their cooperation and patience.' And a Met Office spokesman said: 'Last night a supercell thunderstorm crossed Greater Manchester causing damage. 'We know from our Dopplar radar that it had a strong rotating updraft. Whilst we don't yet have surface data to confirm, the presence of these features suggests a tornado at the surface was likely.' * Hit by the tornado?

    "text": "El defensor chileno de River, Paulo Díaz, habló en la previa al Superclásico ante Boca y aseguró que “la gente siempre los quiere ganar, nosotros también y vamos a ir por eso”.\nDíaz, que dio una conferencia de prensa junto al lateral de Boca Luis Advíncula, aseguró que esta seguidilla de partidos que atraviesa River “es importantísima. Creo que tuvimos resultados positivos y queremos ir a la Boca para sacar un resultado positivo para nosotros”.\nDe todas maneras, reconoció que La Bombonera “es una cancha difícil porque ellos te hacen sentir la localía. Nosotros queremos sacar un buen resultado y llevarnos los tres puntos de visitante”.\nCon respecto a su preparación personal para los Superclásicos, Díaz aseguró que lo hace “como en todos los partidos, aunque este tenga algo especial”.\nAl ser consultado por el tipo de partido que espera, dijo: “Como todos los Superclásicos. Golpe a golpe, que sea lo mejor posible para dar un buen espectáculo ante la gente”.\nPor otra parte, se refirió a su expulsión ante Colo-Colo, en el partido de ida de los cuartos de final de la Copa Libertadores: “Lo que pasó ya está, estoy arrepentido porque me pierdo la vuelta y creo que soy importante para el plantel, aunque otros lo pueden hacer de buena manera”. Además, sostuvo que “siempre quiere estar en todos los partidos, así que le pido disculpas a la gente de River, fue más que nada una tontería”.\nEn la última fecha, se implementó una curiosa modalidad, en la que solo se les permite a los capitanes hablar con los árbitros. Ante esta modificación, Díaz confesó que “es raro porque a mí me gusta estar encima y todo eso, pero hay un designado y hay que respetarlo”.\nPor último, reveló que su jugada soñada para ganar el partido “es hacer un gol en alguna pelota parada”.\nBoca y River protagonizarán este sábado, a partir de las 16, una nueva edición del Superclásico del fútbol argentino, en un partido correspondiente a la decimoquinta fecha de la Liga Profesional de Fútbol.",

    "text": "(Fotos: X) Los habitantes de ‘La Casa de los Famosos México 2024′ continúan envueltos en controversia por sus ácidos comentarios o revelaciones. En esta ocasión fue Sian Chiong , actor de origen cubano, quien lanzó un comentario despectivo sobre Wendy Guevara y su preparación académica . Éste llegó a oídos de la influencer y no dudó en defenderse en redes sociales.\nLa influencer realizó una transmisión en vivo donde habló sobre el tema a petición de sus fans. Para ello, comenzó por recordar las palabras que Sian lanzó en su contra durante una conversación con Ricardo Peralta:\n“Dice: ‘Ricardo, que bueno que entraste tú porque la otra persona que estuvo aquí’, o sea la otra jota, o sea yo, ‘Pues es una persona que no está preparada, tú si hablas otro idioma, tienes estudios’”. Wendy con el maletín de los 4 millones de pesos en la final de 2023. (Captura de Pantalla - YouTube Canal 5) ‘La Perdida’ explicó que no quería entrar en controversia, pero decidió hablar al respecto en defensa del público. No sólo recomendó que Sian investigue en dónde vive, también explicó que muchas personas no tienen la posibilidad de acceder a preparación académica o terminar sus estudios por múltiples circunstancias.\n“En México, a veces muchas personas no tenemos oportunidades de estudiar porque nacemos y crecemos en lugares de bajos recursos y por cosas de la vida. El chico viene de otro lugar a conseguir trabajo aquí, no importa el lugar de donde vengas, pero deberías informate del lugar a donde vas a ir a vivir”, dijo.\n“Deberían de checar eso antes de abrir el hocico, que muchas personas que vivimos en México somos personas que carecimos, que venimos desde abajo... por esas personas tú tragas, papasito”. Los 13 habitantes intentaron hacer las paces, horas después de confrontarse por Sian Chiong. (Vix +) Asimismo, comentó que el cubano no tendría un buen futuro en el reality show de Televisa y presumió su triunfo, pues se coronó como la primera ganadora del mismo programa en 2023.\n“Le mando muchas bendiciones, obvio no va a ganar ‘La Casa de los Famosos’, obvio es un mueble, nadie lo quiere por hipócrita. Nada más está de conveniencia para ver con quién puede hacer equipo, es doble cara (...) yo tan siquiera podré ser un payaso, pero sacarle una sonrisa a una persona es más difícil que lo que hace él, se aburrido, sin gracia dentro de la casa, ser un mueble, eso no me gusta”, respondió.\nFinalmente, revivió la polémica que existe en torno a las preferencias sexuales de Sian Chiong:\n“A mi me encantan los problemas y todavía me buscan mi ocic*. Yo siempre le digo a la gente que me sigue que no vayan a pelearse con nadie. Este muchacho cubano yo me lo encontré en un antro gay allá en Cuba, no voy a decir cómo ni qué estaba haciendo, porque uno no puede sacar a nadie del closet a las personas hasta que lo decida”",
