    "title": "Why Bill 33 bringing SROs back endangers Ontario classrooms",
    "text": "Education Minister Paul Calandra claims Bill 33, The Supporting Children and Students Act, will make Ontario schools safer. How can that be true when it mandates the return of police to schools?\nProposing to bring back the School Resource Officer program, Calandra has turned his back on years of research that tells us that Black, Indigenous and racialized students do not feel safe attending schools with a police presence, that police in schools does not reduce the incidence of violence, but they do prop up the school-to-prison pipeline.\nThe Ontario Human Rights Commission, in its 2021 “Framework for change to address systemic racism in policing,” warned that SRO programs risked replicating systemic and discriminatory practices in the very spaces where children should be safest.\nIn the same report, data from the Ottawa-Carlton District School Board showed that 62 per cent of Black respondents, and 68 per cent of LGBT2SQ+ respondents, disagreed with the idea that officers make school a safer place. Similar feedback was found at Peel District School Board, Greater-Essex County District School Board, Grand Erie District School Board and Toronto District School Board among others.\nCurrently, dozens of community organizations have endorsed a statement opposing the return of the SRO program and have planned a rally outside Queen’s Park for this Thursday at noon.\nIn a time when data is critical, when evidence is routinely upheld as the cornerstone of sound policy, Bill 33 ignores that record. Schedule Two compels boards to admit police at the request of any local service, with no consultation, no equity review, and no option to opt-out.\nI grew up in Jane and Finch and still remember the grief and pain surrounding the death of Jordan Manners, the 15-year-old student shot and killed at C.W. Jefferys Collegiate Institute in 2007. At the time, community advocates, traumatized and seeking solutions acquiesced to School Resource Officers in school hoping that the humanity and dignity of Black students would be seen. The TDSB placed officers in over 40 schools.\nAlmost a decade later the TDSB disbanded the SRO program after a review surveying more than 15,000 students. While that review indicated that most respondents said they felt safer with police in schools, over 70 per cent also said they never interacted with an SRO. Over 800 of the students who did, said they felt uncomfortable and upwards of 2000 students indicated other negative sentiments, like feeling watched, targeted and intimidated. The authors of the report placed significant concern on these findings and recommended ending the program. Yet here we are again.\nWe cannot forget that this is the province where police went into a school and tased a 12-year-old girl, where school officials called the police on a four-year-old boy or where police handcuffed a six-year-old girl. We also cannot forget just months ago a York Region teenager was also shot and killed by police.\nToronto police’s own data, tells us that Black people were 20 times more likely to be shot dead by police. Twenty times … a figure so disproportional it garnered international headlines.\nWith this bill, the Ford government is baiting the death or critical injury of a Black child at the hands of police. This is not hyperbole.\nMy own children, tall Black students, love school, but we see how the anticipation of suspicion erodes the mental health and achievement of students. It tells young people that the province where they once saw their future, sees them as threats and risks.\nThey should be protected by human rights law; the Ontario Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination in services. But Bill 33 makes racial disparity and disproportionality foreseeable.\nThe 2024 Auditor General’s Annual Report noted an increase in violent incidents in Ontario schools by 114 per cent between the 2017/18 and 2022/23 school years. But the recommendations on how to address the rise included increasing mental health supports via social workers, child and youth workers and educational assistants. It also reported that staffing for these mental health supports have not increased at the same rate at the documented demand.\nThis data does not propel the need for policing within schools; what it does illuminate is a clear systemic failure to meet students’ evolving needs.\nIf we want to change these outcomes, there is a better path. If the province truly wants to see a change in educational outcomes and achievements, they have to treat children like children. Invest in them. Create more roles for well-trained child and youth workers, culturally responsive mental health teams, and restorative practices to prevent the criminalization of Black students.\nOntario’s MPPs, duly elected to protect and work for all members of their communities, need to make their voices heard and must remove Schedule Two from Bill 33.\nParents, educators, and students are watching. We will write, march, litigate, and vote. If even one Black child is injured or harmed because an officer misreads teenage emotion, the names Ford and Calandra will forever be tied to that tragedy. Even if they won’t acknowledge it, Black children do matter.",

    "text": "VATICAN CITY (VATICAN CITY)\nOpIndia [New Delhi, India]\nFebruary 23, 2024\nOn Wednesday (21st February), two former nuns\nrevealed how a Slovenbia-based Catholic priest named Marko Rupnik sexually abused them three decades ago in the garb of ‘spiritual growth.’\nThe victims, identified as Gloria Branciani and Mirjam Kovac, were members of the Ignatius of Loyola community. The duo held a press conference in Rome on Wednesday and informed the media that Rupnik forced them to watch pornography and have a threesome in the early 1990s.\n“He took me to pornographic theatres to help me ‘grow spiritually’…He said that I would not grow spiritually if I did not meet his sexual needs. We had another nun have sex with us because he said it was like the Trinity”,\nnarrated Gloria Branciani.\n“(Rupnik) was always protected by everyone, and everything that you could accuse him of was either minimized or denied…” she added.\n“We hope that our testimony – and for this reason we’re exposing ourselves like this, because we feel protected and supported – will stimulate a greater transparency and a consciousness by everyone, and also maybe the pope who wasn’t really aware of the facts that occurred,” Gloria Branciani further emphasised.\nIt must be mentioned that the victim left the Slovene community in 1993 and had even informed senior Vatican officials at that time. She said that no action was taken against Rupnik and that her accusations were dismissed.\nDuring the press conference, former nun Mirjam Kovac said, “We were all young girls, full of ideals. But these very ideals, together with our training in obedience, were exploited for abuses of various kinds: of conscience, of power, spiritual, psychic, physical and often sexual.”\nWho is Marko Rupnik\nMarko Rupnik is a famous mosaic artist and a priest at a religious community in Slovenia. He has been accused of sexually abusing at least 20 women in the past 30 years.\nHe was temporarily excommunicated by the Church after he absolved a woman of having a sexual relationship with him. Rupnik was reinstated two weeks later after he ‘repented’ for his actions. It was only in June 2023 that he was\nexpelled from the Jesuit order, the same one as that of Pope Francis.\nAnne Barrett Doyle of ‘Bishop Accountability’, who documents church crimes, described Marko Rupnik as a “powerful cleric who was protected at the highest levels of the Church and the Vatican.” She added, “The Rupnik case shows that little has changed.”\nRupnik, however, continues to serve as a ‘priest’ in a diocese in Koper city of Slovenia. His mosaic art can be found in the Catholic shrine in Lourdes (France), the cathedral in Aparecida (Brazil), and the Redemptoris Mater chapel of the Apostolic Palace (Vatican).",

    "title": "Shopper sparks debate after sharing picture of Goodwill price tag: 'This is getting out of hand' - NewsBreak",
    "text": "The point of thrift stores is to sell items at a vast discount relative to their normal prices at typical clothing, department, or retail outlets. However, it seems one particular shop did not receive the message. A post on the r/ThriftStoreHauls subreddit has gone viral for showcasing the absolutely outrageous $599.99 price tag on a Coogi sweater , the popular and colorful brand made famous in the 90s, in part by rapper the Notorious B.I.G. Out of context, nothing seems wrong. Based on the pictures in the carousel, the sweater appears to be in perfect condition. If you check the Coogi website, that price is not out of range for their sweaters, which multiple commenters on the Reddit post pointed out. That price, however, is typical for a brand-new Coogi sweater. The point of a thrift store is to sell goods at downmarket rates, so this was either a complete mistake or yet another sign of greed from the exact kind of store that is supposed to provide a safe haven from high prices. If that price was a choice and not just an honest mistake, many shoppers are likely to become frustrated and be turned off from shopping at these stores, which would be a major disappointment. Aside from intangible, personal gratifications, the financial and societal benefits of shopping secondhand are innumerable, including saving money on everyday necessities and discovering rare and valuable items at great discounts. Thrifting also keeps items out of landfills . Giving them a second chance to be bought by eco- or budget-conscious customers instead of being thrown away keeps the items from contributing to a literally overflowing pollution problem. By and large, commenters were angry at this price tag, both in relation to the sweater specifically and thrift stores in general. \"600?? At a Goodwill??? This is getting out of hand,\" one user commented . \"That sweater is absolutely delicious... Seeing that price almost killed me though…\" read another top response. What's your primary motivation in shopping at thrift stores? Cheaper clothes Trendier items Reduced environmental impact I don't thrift Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. A third commenter aptly summarized the entire issue: \"Someone DONATED that for FREE and you wanna charge retail???? F*** all these Grift Stores being so greedy.\" Join our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet. first appeared on .",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#16](c16#c-16) Eso tiene una pinta de bulo que no puede con ella, otro más con Milei. Pero que se ponga como algo negativo, y además así en mayúsculas, \"JUDIO\", eso dice mucho sobre el rumbo que está tomando la izquierda moderna. Y no para bien.\n[#16](c16#c-16) Y?\nQue le impide a un liberal ser judío?\nSer liberal es estar a favor de la libertad individual y no les veras criticar la sexualidad de cada uno, de hecho Milei ya se ha pronunciado en esa linea.\nJavier Milei aclaró su posición sobre la homosexualidad y dio un particular ejemplo para explicarla: “Si querés estar con un elefante...”\nEl rival de Sergio Massa en el balotaje se manifestó a favor del matrimonio igualitario; “para mi, el matrimonio es un contrato. Puede ser de dos partes, tres partes o 50″, sostuvo en diálogo con Jaime Bayly\nhttps://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/javier-milei-aclaro-su-posicion-sobre-la-homosexualidad-y-dio-un-particular-ejemplo-para-explicarla-nid08112023/\nLo que si estará en contra es de subvencionar asociaciones.\nMilei será todo lo tarado que sea,pero nunca ha estado en contra del colectivo LGTBI. De hecho sería una mala estrategia, teniendo en cuenta que cada voto cuenta. Aquí explica el porqué no está en contra,\n[#2](c2#c-2) precisamente porque es liberal (no conservador): [#10](c10#c-10) Y además es que se están poniendo como representantes de dichos \"colectivos\" cuando hay mucha gente que son gays/lesbianas o lo que sea que NO están de acuerdo con ellos.\n[#13](c13#c-13) Esos mismos que van cantando que son del colectivo y no les representan cuando lo pueden decir abiertamente gracias a las personas de las que se quejan. Muy coherente todo.\n[#28](c28#c-28) No, no me iré a Gaza a defender los derechos de los homosexuales, ahora mismo tienen problemas con su propia supervivencia, están para ir con banderitas arcoiris a tocarles las narices.\nMe quedaré aquí a defender mis derechos y los de mis prójimos para poder aportar mi granito de arena a la causa y que si bien no todo lo que se hable en los foros del colectivo sea de mi agrado no voy a quejarme de la persona que se ponga al frente de la lucha si en el fondo el resultado que está consiguiendo es mejor que lo que podría haber conseguido yo.\nPor otro lado, la tontería está en \"mandarnos a Gaza\" a defender la causa.\n[#6](c6#c-6) A mi también me llamó la atención, yo me sabía, del colectivo, hasta la Q, pero veo que han aparecido otras dos.\nTodos mis respetos a todos los colectivos, pero al querer estar todos representados bajo unas siglas, hace años que me perdí con las últimas letras. Quizás va siendo hora de ponerse de acuerdo en todos o todas o todes... mira, da igual, ya me acostumbraré a escribir las siglas buscando en google o preguntándole al chatgpt.",
