    "title": "Las alertas por fuertes lluvias se activarán este sábado en Valencia, Cataluña y Baleares",
    "text": "Las alertas por fuertes lluvias se activarán este sábado en la Comunitat Valenciana, Cataluña y Baleares, según la predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet). En concreto, Mallorca y Menorca activarán alertas naranjas hasta el amanecer y Tarragona mantendrá esta misma alerta durante toda la jornada por el mismo fenómeno, mientras que Barcelona y Girona contarán con alertas amarillas durante la madrugada por lluvias y fenómenos costeros. En la Comunidad Valenciana, la provincia de Castellón mantendrá la alerta amarilla por fuertes durante todo el día, en tanto que Alicante y Valencia activarán alertas amarillas por lluvias durante las primeras horas de la madrugada. Aemet ha puesto el foco en la previsión de chubascos y tormentas fuertes y persistentes en el sur y litorales de Cataluña, Castellón y Baleares, así como a primeras horas en zonas del sur de la Comunitat Valenciana, pudiendo llegar a ser muy fuertes en el entorno del bajo Ebro y nordeste del archipiélago; ligado a esto, se esperan intervalos fuertes de viento en puntos del litoral catalán. En un plano general, la agencia ha apuntado que se prevé que se produzca una transición hacia una situación de mayor estabilidad, si bien han recordado que la DANA aún dejará precipitaciones en Andalucía occidental y oeste de Alborán, además del ya mencionado nordeste del país. También son posibles chubascos dispersos en el resto de Andalucía, Murcia, ambas mesetas y montañas del extremo norte, mientras que en Canarias predominarán los intervalos nubosos tendiendo a aumentar, con probabilidad de dejar chubascos dispersos en las islas montañosas. En lo referente a las temperaturas, las máximas irán en aumento en el suroeste peninsular y descenderán en litorales cantábricos y entorno de la Ibérica oriental-bajo Ebro, en tanto que las mínimas bajarán ligeramente por lo general, con posibles heladas débiles en cumbres de Pirineos y Sierra Nevada. Sobre los vientos, la Aemet ha pronosticado que predominarán de componente este en la Península y Baleares, en general flojos en interiores y más intensos en litorales, con probables intervalos de fuerza en el Estrecho junto al ya mencionado litoral catalán. En Canarias soplarán vientos flojos predominando las componentes norte y este, y tendiendo a rolar a suroeste en las islas occidentales.",

    "text": "A tourist from China has told how she managed to escape a deadly flood in Kenya by spending 12 hours up a tree, losing all her luggage before emerging from the raging water wearing just a T-shirt and underwear.\\nThe woman’s will to survive has wowed mainland social media.\\nLiu Jiatu, 28, who lives in Thailand, was caught in the flood at the famous Masai Mara tourist destination on May 1.\\nHeavier than usual rainfall had pounded Eastern Africa due to the combined effects of El Niño and the long rainy season from March to May 2024.\\nLiu was staying at the luxury Basecamp Masai Mara tented hotel which hosted former US President Barack Obama in 2006.\\nShe was wakened by bed-shaking thunder at 1.15 am and found herself knee-deep in water.\\n\\nThe tent’s main entrance was locked and there was no time to find the key. Chaos ensued with floating furniture in the darkness, Liu decided to use brute force to break out of the tent.\\n“Carrying two phones in my mouth, I tried to tear a hole in the tent fabric. My survival instinct gave me unprecedented strength and I succeeded,” Liu said.\\nOnce outside, she climbed up a tree and saw her tent being ripped apart by a torrent.\\nLiu’s driver was unable to help her and she spent a cold night up the tree with a local who did not speak English.\\nAs dawn broke, she found herself surrounded by rotting leaves and an array of insects, her feet bruised and scratched. Below her, the water swirled menacingly.\\nTo keep her spirits up, she watched videos of her pet dog on her phone.\\n“To stay awake, I started pricking my finger with the pin from my earring. Afraid of dehydration and knowing that no supplies would reach me, I bit my mouth, thinking I could drink my blood to survive if needed,” Liu wrote on Weibo.\\nAt 7 am, a helicopter team arrived but the dense trees made a rescue impossible.\\nAt noon, the local youth she was stuck up the tree with used ropes to move her to safety. At 12.30 pm Liu finally set foot on dry land.\\nHer will to survive has impressed mainland social media.\\n“Feels like you could write a book, your survival skills are strong!” one online observer said.\\n“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, your good fortune lies ahead!” another added.\\n\\nIt is not Liu’s first brush with extreme danger.\\nIn July 2019, she suffered a sudden subarachnoid haemorrhage while at the gym and survived despite being in critical condition.\\nA medical examination showed she only suffered minor infections in her wounds.\\n“I have cheated death twice in five years, I am now terrifyingly strong!” Liu wrote on Weibo.\\nShe has demanded an apology and compensation from the hotel.\\nA total of 257 people were killed and 293,000 others displaced across 31 of Kenya’s 47 counties as a result of the floods.\\n",

    "title": "Illinois basketball star Terrence Shannon found not guilty in rape trial",
    "text": "LAWRENCE, Kan. — Terrence Shannon Jr., the University of Illinois men’s basketball star and potential first-round pick in this month’s NBA draft, has been found not guilty of grabbing an 18-year-old woman’s buttocks under her skirt and penetrating her vagina with his finger in September at a bar near the University of Kansas campus.\nThe 23-year-old Chicago native sat motionless as a Douglas County jury returned the unanimous verdict after 90 minutes of deliberation. His mother, Treanette Redding, put her hand to her face in tears\nHis accuser and her friend sat expressionless.\nIn the hallway, drying her tears, Redding, said she was “relieved” by the verdict.\n“The accusations didn’t match the person that I raised,” Redding said. “I knew my son wasn’t capable of something like that. I’m just happy justice was served.”\nPeople are also reading…\nEarlier Thursday, with his parents, stepfather and other loved ones in the gallery, Shannon took the stand on the trial’s fourth and final day and emphatically denied allegations that stem from a September trip he and two others took to Lawrence to watch an Illini-Jayhawks football game.\n“I never touched, grabbed, pulled over. … That did not happen,” Shannon told the jury.\nIn his closing arguments, Senior Assistant District Attorney Ricardo Leal said the case boiled down to two college students: one, a “typical” student from a junior college who went with her friend to a bar, despite liking neither crowds or drinking, because it’s what college students do; the other, an “atypical” star college athlete who “might as well be the king of the University of Illinois.”\n“When he wants something,” Leal said, “he gets it.”\nShannon’s defense attorney, Bruce Sutter, spent his closing arguments attempting to dismantle a case he called “a travesty” and a police investigation from a Lawrence police detective that Sutter said did not deserve to be called as such.\n“Two things aren’t debatable,” Sutter told jurors. “Simple science dictates that Terrence Shannon Jr. isn’t responsible for this crime, and there’s been absolutely no effort to find the perpetrator guilty of this crime.”\nThe jury deliberations began just before 2 p.m.\nThe state’s case largely centered on testimony from Shannon’s accuser and her best friend, who was with her the night of the alleged encounter in a basement bar area of the Jayhawk Cafe called the Martini Room.\nThe 18-year-old told jurors she and her friend were heading for the exit that night when she spotted a cute boy wave her toward him. He was tall, she said, had different colored dreadlocks and wore a mustard-yellow shirt.\nAt her friend’s encouragement, they reentered the bar about 12:15 a.m. That’s when she said the man grabbed her and pulled her to him. She said she thought they would talk and exchange phone numbers or Snapchats. Instead, she said no words were exchanged. With a drink in one hand and a phone in the other, both arms pressed near her chest, she said she looked straight ahead as she felt the man’s hand move under her skirt to her butt.\n“I was definitely uncomfortable,” she told jurors. “I don’t know why I didn’t (walk away). But I wish I did.”\nNext, she said, she felt his hand move her underwear to the side and a finger inside her for what she estimated to be no more than 10 seconds.\n“I didn’t react,” she said. “All I did was stand there in shock.”\nBlack-and-white surveillance footage from the Martini Room played during the trial appeared to show Shannon and the woman moments before — but not during — the alleged encounter.\nWhen it was over, she said, she pushed through the crowd to leave and to look for her friend. The two eventually left the bar. By then, she said, she was too hysterical to drive.\nThe woman said she returned to her apartment around 1:15 a.m. Saturday, and started to search for the man’s identity. She remembered that the man had been standing by a KU basketball player at the bar. She eventually identified Shannon, she said, after searching online for photos from rosters for football and basketball teams at KU and Illinois.\nShe did not immediately call police, she said, fighting back tears, “because I didn’t want to end up here.”\nShe and her friend spoke with police that same Saturday of the alleged sexual assault and then went to a Lawrence hospital, where a sexual assault nurse examination kit was collected. The two eventually returned to the Martini Room later that same night, according to testimony from a computer forensics expert who, acting on a defense subpoena, extracted data from the woman’s friend’s phone.\nPhone records also showed a December group message thread involving the two women and their two other roommates, including the best friend’s sister. The exchange included a link to an ESPN article on Shannon’s suspension from the Illini men’s team following the rape charge, and a message from the friend’s sister that read “got his ass,” followed by two face emojis with dollar signs for eyes and cash for tongues.\nThe testimony did not mention any response from the 18-year-old to that message.\nThe trial saw testimony from two forensic scientists, one from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, the other privately hired by the defense, whose analysis and interpretation of DNA in the case reached somewhat different conclusions.\nBoth agreed that no male DNA was detected in swabs taken from the 18-year-old’s vagina and genital area.\nThe KBI forensic scientist wrote in her report that swabs from the interior and exterior crotch of the woman’s underwear revealed an “insufficient amount of male DNA” to move forward with testing, though she told jurors Wednesday that those levels were essentially too low to say conclusively whether they were even DNA.\nBut the defense’s forensic scientist called the report’s reference to male DNA “a very misleading statement.”\nUsing a different measurement threshold than the KBI, the defense’s scientist also concluded “with scientific certainty” that Shannon’s DNA was not in a sample collected from the 18-year-old’s buttocks.\nThe lack of DNA evidence, Sutter said in closing arguments, “blows the case out of the water.”\nHe also chastised police for failing to interview possible witnesses and an alternative suspect who had been accused of a similar crime, two weeks earlier, in the same spot in the Martini Room where Shannon’s accuser said she was assaulted.\n“This isn’t our burden,” Sutter told jurors, “and yet, after doing this case and listening to the testimony, I think you’ll all agree we proved it’s not Terrence Shannon Jr.”",

    "text": "Israel and Hezbollah are exchanging hundreds of cross-border strikes in the wake of the [shocking explosions of wireless devices](https://abcnews.go.com/International/pagers-exploded-lebanon-syria/story?id=113800213) across Lebanon last week. 'No cease-fire' in Lebanon, Israel's foreign minister says Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared on social media on Thursday that there \"will be no ceasefire in the north,\" as U.S.-led efforts to prevent a full-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon appeared to fall flat. \"We will continue to fight against the terrorist organization Hezbollah with all our might until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,\" Katz wrote in a post to X. The statement came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed reports that the U.S. was gathering international support for a 21-day cease-fire. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday the plan had \"significant\" backing. \"This is an American-French proposal, to which the prime minister did not even respond,\" a post to Netanyahu's official X page said. The Israel Defense Forces continued its bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon overnight into Thursday while its troops prepared for an expected ground operation. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the chief of the IDF General Staff, told units at the northern border on Wednesday: \"We are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory.\" -ABC News' Jordana Miller and David Brennan IDF continues deadly strikes as ground offensive looms At least 23 more people were killed as Israeli warplanes continued airstrikes in Lebanon through Thursday morning. The Israel Defense Forces said its aircraft struck approximately 75 Hezbollah targets in the south of the country and the eastern Bekaa region overnight. The force said it is continuing operations \"to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's capabilities.\" Since Monday, Israel's intensified air campaign killed nearly 700 people and wounded more than 1,700 others, per data from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. The IDF said Hezbollah fired approximately 45 projectiles into Israel from Lebanon on Thursday morning, some of which were intercepted with the rest falling in open areas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, dismissed hopes of a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that would forestall Israel's planned ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Netanyahu \"instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force and according to the plans presented to him,\" according to a statement published on his official X page on Thursday. -ABC News' Jordana Miller and Joe Simonetti Netanyahu says cease-fire news 'incorrect,' vows to continue fight in Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said news about a potential cease-fire deal between Hezbollah and Israel being discussed is \"incorrect.\" \"This is an American-French proposal, to which the prime minister did not even respond,\" he said in [a statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1839227205022257224) posted on social media on Thursday. He added, \"The news about the supposed directive to moderate the fighting in the north is also the opposite of the truth. The Prime Minister instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force, and according to the plans presented to him. Also, the fighting in Gaza will continue until all the goals of the war are achieved.\" -ABC News' Joe Simonetti and Kevin Shalvey Biden says 'significant support' for Israel-Lebanon cease-fire plan President Joe Biden told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday night that the U.S. was \"able to generate significant support from Europe, as well as the Arab nations\" for a 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to head off a full-scale war in Lebanon. \"It's important this war not widen,\" the president said. \"I'll have more to say about it tomorrow.\" In a call with reporters just before the president landed, senior administration officials described the proposal as a \"breakthrough\" they hoped would produce momentum in Lebanon and in stalled talks between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip \"This is an important breakthrough on the Lebanon side, given all that has gone on there, particularly over the last few weeks,\" a senior administration official said. \"But you know, we will try to use the space that provides wisely on all on all fronts.\" The officials indicated that a response is expected over the next several hours. \"I guess the parties are going to respond for themselves to the call, but I can share that we have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment, based on the call, based on our discussion, they are familiar with the text and again, we'll let them speak to their actions of accepting the deal in the coming hours,\" a senior administration official said. Officials said they'd been negotiating with Lebanon nonstop for the past 48 hours, and that its leaders there were aware they speak for \"everything that happens on that side of the border,\" indicating that they will accept the deal on behalf of Hezbollah. \"So our expectation is when the government of Lebanon or when the government of Israel both accept this, this will carry and be implemented as a ceasefire on both sides, on both sides of the blue line, for the period of the 21 days,\" an official said. -ABC News Cheyenne Haslett US troops in Cyprus preparing for Lebanon evacuations, official confirms A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that the small number of additional American military personnel deployed to the Middle East are on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where they are planning for \"non-combatant evacuation operations\" in Lebanon. The planning remains a precautionary measure, the official said. ABC News understands that between 12 and 24 American troops are involved in the preparations, not all of whom are special operations personnel. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Wednesday she could not confirm the exact number of personnel deployed. \"What I can tell you is that we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment forces that are already in the region,\" she told reporters. \"I'm just not going to be able to provide you more specifics,\" she added. \"I know it's frustrating, but I'm just not going to be able to confirm more.\" -ABC News' Luis Martinez Israel to use 'all means' in Lebanon if diplomacy fails, diplomat says Danny Danon, Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, told reporters on Wednesday that his nation would \"prefer a diplomatic solution\" to its unfolding conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that \"if it fails to return our residents to their homes, then we will use all means at our disposal.\" \"We are entirely focused on achieving our objectives, which in the north is the return of our displaced citizens who have become refugees in their own country,\" Dannon said. \"Do not mistake a peaceful nation for a defenseless one. We have the means, we have the capabilities to achieve this goal.\" Danon again expressed that Israel was \"open to ideas\" to avoid a full-scale war. \"But you know, we are very honest about it. Our goal is to push Hezbollah from the fence, allow the residents to come back to the communities, and I hope we'll be able to achieve it without using our military capabilities,\" he said. Israel is already conducting an extensive airstrike campaign across southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, as well as limited airstrikes in the capital Beirut and elsewhere. Israeli actions have killed more than 650 people -- including at least 50 children -- and wounded more than 1,700 others since Monday, according to Lebanese authorities. Danon declined to weigh in on whether progress had been made towards a pause, but said negotiators \"know exactly what we expect.\" -ABC News' Shannon Kingston Iran will not be 'indifferent' if Israel invades Lebanon, minister says Iran \"will not remain indifferent in case of a full-scale war in Lebanon,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Araghchi also warned that Israel's \"crimes will not go unpunished,\" and said the Middle East region \"risks full-scale conflict\" if the U.N. Security Council does not \"act now to halt Israel's war and enforce an immediate ceasefire.\" \"The path to de-escalation is clear,\" Araghchi said. \"Israel must immediately stop its attacks on Gaza and Lebanon. Without a ceasefire in Gaza, there will be no guarantee of peace in the region.\" \"The Security Council must act now to halt Israel's war and enforce an immediate ceasefire, and by that, to save innocent lives. If not, the region risks full-scale conflict and history will hold Israel's enablers, especially the United States, responsible.\" \"Iran will not remain indifferent in case of a full-scale war in Lebanon,\" the diplomat added. \"We stand with the people of Lebanon with all means.\" -ABC News' Ellie Kaufman",
