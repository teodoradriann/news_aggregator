    "title": "Two animal health organizations to commercialize H5N1 vaccine for dairy cattle",
    "text": "The vaccine is in the final stages of review for conditional license approval\nElanco Animal Health and Medgene, a South Dakota-based animal health company focusing on vaccine technology, have entered into an agreement which includes the commercialization of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 vaccine for dairy cattle, developed by Medgene.1 The partnership comes at a time when bird flu cases are on the rise, with infections observed in humans as well as several wild and domestic mammals, including cats, dogs, raccoons, bears, foxes, and more.2,3\nThe vaccine has met all platform technology guidelines requirements from the USDA, according to the company. It is now in the final stages of review for conditional license approval.1\n“Medgene has an established reputation of supporting animal owners and their veterinarians with our USDA-licensed platform technology and bioinformatics software to design transformational vaccines,” Mark Luecke, CEO of Medgene, said in a news release.1 “With our critically important H5N1 vaccine for dairy cattle in the final stages of approval, we’re excited to partner with Elanco to quickly bring this much needed solution to US dairies.”\nMedgene’s vaccine platform technology in cattle received prior approval from the USDA, which accelerated Medgene’s H5N1 vaccine development, according to the company.1 The company also has existing vaccine manufacturing supply ready for deployment to support the US dairy herd, said Elanco.1\nCurrently entering its fourth year, the H5N1 outbreak has affected 973 dairy herds, with 17 states in the US experiencing outbreaks in dairy cows as of February 21, 2025.3 “The cross-species transmission of the disease into nearly 1,000 dairy herds across the US since March 2024, along with zoonotic transmission to people, shows that more interventions are quickly needed. This virus is prevalent and predicted to persist over time, thus a cattle vaccine will be critical to slow virus spread between birds and cattle,” wrote Elanco in a news release.1\n“As egg prices soar and milk production wanes in infected dairies, the need for new solutions to curb disease spread is evident,” Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco said.1 “Elanco is pleased to partner with Medgene to bring customers options to fight this devastating disease and believes this product will become part of a routine vaccination protocol for the US dairy industry. This partnership further strengthens our diverse dairy portfolio and advances our One Health platform of animal health solutions, not only benefitting our dairy customers, but helping curb disease spread for our poultry customers, and working to improve egg prices for consumers.”\nZoetis also has an H5N1 vaccine, for which it received a conditional license in 2016 and a contract award for the USDA’s National Veterinary Stockpile. The vaccine was later utilized by the US Fish & Wildlife Service in 2023 to protect California condors.4\nMore recently, the USDA issued a conditional license for a vaccine—Avian Influenza Vaccine, H5N2 Subtype, Killed Virus, developed by Zoetis—to protect chickens against the H5N2 subtype of HPAI, a newer strain of HPAI detected in the US in early 2022.4 Causing severe disease in birds, HPAI H5N2 has a high mortality rate in these animals. However, this subtype of avian influenza has a lower zoonotic transmission when compared to H5N1, with fewer reports of infection in mammals.5\nStill, HPAI H5N2 outbreaks in birds have been observed in several countries in the last few decades, including Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Haiti, and the US. In May 2024, Mexico confirmed the first recorded human case of H5N2 in a 59-year-old man with underlying conditions, who later died due to complications. The patient had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals.5\nFewer than 10% of cows in a herd have shown signs of illness, with the lactating cows being most highly impacted.6 Common clinical signs of H5N1 in cows include low appetite and reduced milk production. Abnormal appearance of milk, such as milk that is thickened and/or discolored is another sign of infection.\nReferences",

    "title": "McKinleyville murder trial nears conclusion: Testimony from psychiatrists continues – Times-Standard",
    "text": "On Thursday, the cross examination of a psychiatrist who concluded a man who fatally shot his best friend in McKinleyville was operating under severe delusions wrapped up. Deputy District Attorney Candace Myers asked Dr. Robert Soper several questions about his medical conclusions regarding the mental state of Jasen Coley, who fatally shot 25-year-old Kenneth “Michael” Davis on July 3. Soper said that Coley met the requirements for a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict – which would send Coley to a state hospital, rather than a 15-year-to-life prison sentence – and Myers wanted the specifics on how he reached that conclusion. Soper said that, while Coley’s specific documented delusions might have changed over time, the paranoid psychosis was consistent. “He was having the same reported symptoms before he murdered anybody,” Soper said. Coley had been hospitalized at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in February for suicidal ideation and paranoid delusions. In previous testimony, Dr. William Darby – appointed at Myers’ request – said Coley told him he killed Davis because “gray aliens” in the woods he would visit told him to do it. Soper said he concluded Coley killed Davis out of a delusion that it would protect his family from getting their organs harvested, wealth stolen and being human trafficked. However, Soper said that Coley never specifically told him Davis was an alien, though Darby testified that Coley believed Davis was either an evil “black alien” or aligned with their nefarious goals to harm his family. Myers pointed out that in the interview with law enforcement shortly after Coley’s July 6 arrest, Coley never mentioned aliens or the illuminati as a reason he killed Davis. Soper said this detail is unsurprising. “What’s going on in his head is very different than what comes out of his mouth,” Soper said. Myers also asked, if Coley was protecting his family, why would he only kill Davis instead of others he implicated as threats, including other members of the Davis family and his friends? Soper responded that Coley was deeply psychotic and was not operating on logic. However, Soper said that Coley understood the nature and reality of his actions – a split from Darby – in the sense that Coley knew what he was doing was a crime and that if he fired a gun at Davis, it would kill him. Myers also narrowed in on a comment Coley made during the police interview in which he said he was “going to hell” for killing Davis, even saying “of course,” when asked if he knew that killing Davis was wrong. Soper said he didn’t put too much stake in these comments because of Coley’s delusion that Davis would harm his family – in texts, Coley said the Davis family planned to put his family on a desert island and let them starve to death – and that Coley was morally obligated to protect them, even if he understood that generally killing is illegal and wrong. “You’re (Myers) looking for consistency here and there’s no consistency, it’s not logical,” Soper said. By the Times-Standard’s print deadline, Myers was finishing her cross-examination and Michael Robinson, Coley’s attorney, was preparing for redirect. Coley has been present for proceedings from the county jail, where he remained since his arrest. The Davis and Coley families were also in attendance.

Thursday October 24 2024 11:28 pm Erdoğan poses for the extended BRICS 'family photo' along with other leaders during the summit held in Russia. Duvar English\nThe German newspaper BILD on Oct. 24 reported that India rejected Turkey's BRICS membership bid, citing Ankara's close relations with Pakistan. As a result of India's decision, the required consensus was not reached.\nThe state and government leaders gathered for the BRICS summit decided not to accept new members for the time being, according to reporting by the online news outlet T24 .\nIran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia were the most recent countries to join the BRICS bloc. Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Malaysia officially applied for membership. Experts indicated that there would not be any expansion within BRICS in the near future, citing the opposition of several countries to further enlargement as the reason.\nOn Sept. 2, Turkey officially applied to join BRICS. A report by U.S.-based news agency Bloomberg stated that Turkey sought to increase its global influence and build new connections beyond its traditional Western allies. Anonymous sources said the Erdoğan administration believed that the geopolitical center of gravity was shifting away from developed countries.\nErdoğan on Oct. 24 attended the 16th BRICS summit held in Russia’s Kazan province with Russian leader Putin’s invitation. He touched upon global events, Israel’s attacks on Palestine, and the recent gun attack in the Turkish capital that claimed five lives in his speech.\nIn 2006, Brazil, Russia, India, and China formed the \"BRIC\" group, aiming to give developing countries more influence in international affairs. The group took its name from the first letters of these countries in English. With the inclusion of South Africa in 2011, the group became \"BRICS.\"\nThe purpose of BRICS is defined as an organization that aims to represent the interests of the global East and South, in contrast to the U.S.-led Western bloc. A shared goal of the group is to push for reforms in Western-dominated institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and the United Nations. While Russia initially led BRICS, it has been noted that China increasingly dominates the organization with its economic, population, and political power.\nTurkey applies for BRICS membership to build new alliances 'beyond West' Diplomacy Erdoğan and Putin confirm BRICS summit meeting Diplomacy Why does Turkey want to join BRICS?

Quote > \"UK's Imperial College has produced a new fantasy number to test people’s gullibility. This time they are claiming that 19.8 million lives have been saved by vaccination. Imperial College now have a global reputation for making provable wrong claims based on modelling and they appear to want to bolster that reputation. Previous harm caused by Imperial include Neil Ferguson’s models in 2001 that led to the culling of 6 million cattle and sheep allegedly to prevent spread of foot and mouth disease which cost the UK economy £10bn. Subsequent predictions have included 50,000-150,000 deaths in humans in 2002 due to CJD because of the BSE outbreak (there were 177 deaths), 200 million deaths from bird flu in 2005 worldwide (there were 78); 65,000 deaths from Swine flu in UK in 2009 (there were 457).\" Source: https://www.hartgroup.org/imperial-fantasy-of-20-million-lives-saved",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#57](c57#c-57) La noticia habla de un atentado islamista. ¿ Tu de que crees que hablo ? P.S. No tengo nada contra las cabras.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",
