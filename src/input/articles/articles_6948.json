    "title": "CD Projekt Red has ‘no plans’ to update Cyberpunk 2077 for PS5 Pro",
    "text": "CD Projekt Red officially wrapped up development on Cyberpunk 2077 earlier this year and has now moved on to other projects. With that in mind, it may not be too surprising to hear that the studio is not dedicating resources towards a PS5 Pro update for the game.\nCyberpunk 2077 was originally designed to run on Xbox One and PS4 hardware, but over time, CD Projekt scaled things up, which means the original base version of the game doesn't have all the same updates and features as the version on Xbox Series X/S or PS5. Given that so much extra time was spent polishing up the current-gen console versions of the game, CD Projekt Red doesn't appear to see any need to update the game for the PS5 Pro.\nIn a tweet today, CD Projekt Red confirmed via the CyberpunkGame account that there are “no plans” for a PS5 Pro patch for the game:\nWe currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch\n— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) November 20, 2024\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro launched earlier this month, equipped with the same CPU as the base console, but with a 10% overclock applied, as well as a 40% better GPU. The goal with the console is to enable smooth 60FPS gameplay without sacrificing on ‘Quality Mode' features. Cyberpunk 2077 already runs on PS5 at 4K/30FPS with Ray-Tracing, or at a dynamic resolution without ray-tracing and up to 60FPS.\nWhile updating the game with higher graphical settings should be an easy task, there is testing that needs to be done, and lengthy console-store approval processes to get through. Added up, a PS5 Pro patch would cost CDPR resources during a time where the company is fully focused on new projects, like The Witcher 4. That project recently absorbed most of the remaining developers on Cyberpunk 2077, with a few moving over to CDPR's new US-based studio to work on Cyberpunk 2.\nKitGuru Says: Given what we've heard about PS5 Pro sales, there may not even be enough of a market to warrant the update. So far, most of the studios that have issued PS5 Pro updates either already had strong ties with Sony, or were still in active development on their games when the PS5 Pro was announced and had time to squeeze an update in.",

    "text": "That's the way they all became the Bennett bunch?\nErica Packerand her new boyfriend, celebrity chef Shannon Bennett certainly looked like one big happy family as they and their respective children – nine in total! – bonded over lunch in Byron Bay over the Christmas break.\nAlone time\nThe pair – who reportedly met at the society wedding of chef Guillaume Brahimi and chicken heiress Tamie Ingham in Paris last June – were also spotted sneaking in a cuddle and a kiss when the kids weren't looking, and enjoyed a romantic stroll on the beach together, too.\n\"They weren't flaunting it, but they certainly weren't hiding it either,\" said an onlooker of the loved-up duo.\nThe surprise couple spent the holidays at the 48-year-old MasterChef guest judge's multimillion-dollar waterfront home at Belongil Beach with his six children, Phoenix, 18, Hendrix, 15, Xascha, 13, Xanthe, 11, and nine-year-old twins Xahlia and Margaux, as well as Erica's children with former husband James Packer, Indigo, 15, Jackson, 13, and 11-year-old Emmanuelle.\nThe smiling group were also spotted hanging out together on the Gold Coast in matching T-shirts.\n\"That's lovely news,\" commented one fan of the match. \"They both seem to put their kids first.\"\nDespite having found new love, Erica, 46, has remained amicable with James, still holidaying together as a family with their brood and staying in the tycoon's $72 million penthouse in Sydney's Barangaroo when in Australia.\n\"Divorce is never fun for any couple and there are obviously speed bumps in the road and it's always tricky and you've got to navigate your way through. But I'm really proud of the fact that we've worked really hard to maintain a good relationship and a respectful relationship and a caring relationship because we both love our three kids so much and we have a lot of love for each other still,\" Erica, who split from the billionaire in 2013 and went on to enjoy short-lived romances with Seal and Cuban artist Enrique Martinez Celaya, revealed last year.\n\"We found such a lovely way to co-parent and we take care of each other in how we each co-parent the kids. And I'm grateful for the support that James gives me.\"\nAnd while it's not known whether the former model – who relocated to London with her family in 2023 after nine years in Los Angeles – is now based back in Oz, it seems she could be spending a lot more time in Byron.\nShannon's relationship with his ex and mother of his children,\nMadeleine West– who he split from in 2018 after 13 years – has been less friendly.\nThe chef – who has yet to comment on his romance with Erica – once claimed things had turned \"toxic\" between he and Madeleine following their split.\n\"Having a public profile, having two high-pressure careers, having a multitude of children... it puts exponential pressures on a relationship, and cracks can form,\" Madeleine shared of the pair's struggles, which eventually saw them embroiled in a court battle\nlast year.\nlast year.\nBut the 43-year-old former Neighbours star, who's based in Byron Bay too, has also moved on. The actress has been dating environmental activist Maximo Bottaro for more than three years.",

The Drone detection market is driven by the rising number of illegal drone operations. These operations raise serious security concerns in a number of applications by endangering military installations, vital infrastructure, airports, and public areas. Operational safety and national security may be jeopardized by the growing use of drones for illicit intelligence collection, smuggling, and monitoring. Because of their small size, low altitude, and high maneuverability, unauthorized drone operations are hard to detect with traditional security systems. For this reason, it is crucial to use detection technologies made especially to detect drones.\nDownload PDF Brochure @ [ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=199519485&utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=PaidPR&utm_campaign=dronedetectionmarket ]\nBrowse 250 market data Tables and 100 Figures spread through 300 Pages and in-depth TOC on \"Drone Detection Market\"\nView detailed Table of Content here - https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/drone-detection-market-199519485.html [ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/drone-detection-market-199519485.html?utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=PaidPR&utm_campaign=dronedetectionmarket ]\nImage: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/drone-detection-market.webp [ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/drone-detection-market-199519485.html?utm_source=abnewswire.com&utm_medium=PaidPR&utm_campaign=dronedetectionmarket ]\nBased on Application, the military & defense segment is expected to lead the drone detection market during the forecast period\nBased on application, military & defense applications is expected to lead the drone detection market during the forecasted period. This is due to the increasing threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in modern warfare and security operations. Armed forces worldwide are investing heavily in drone detection and counter-drone technologies to protect military bases, airfields, naval vessels, and border security zones from potential attacks, espionage, and unauthorized surveillance. Drones are being used by adversaries for reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and even as loitering munitions, making their detection and neutralization a top priority for defense agencies. Advanced radar, radio frequency (RF) sensors, and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems are widely deployed in military environments to provide continuous surveillance and rapid response against hostile UAVs.\nBased on type, the handheld segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period\nBased on type, the handheld segment is expected to register the highest CAGR in the drone detection market due to its portability, ease of use, and increasing adoption by security forces, law enforcement agencies, and military personnel. Unlike fixed or vehicle-mounted detection systems, handheld solutions offer mobility, allowing operators to detect and respond to drone threats in real-time across various locations. These devices are particularly useful for tactical operations, border security patrols, and VIP protection, where rapid deployment and flexibility are critical. Additionally, handheld drone detection systems often integrate multiple sensing technologies, such as radio frequency (RF) detection and direction-finding, enabling security personnel to quickly locate and assess unauthorized drones.\nNorth America will lead the drone detection market during the forecast period\nThe Drone detection market in North America will lead the market during the forecast period. This is due to the widespread use of drone security technologies, a rise in unapproved drone activity, and stringent regulatory controls. Significant investments in drone detection systems for military bases and airports are driven by the region's developed defense and homeland security infrastructure, which is dominated by the United States and Canada. Ground-based and radar-based detection methods have become widely used as a result of growing worries about drone-related security issues, such as possible terrorist operations, smuggling, and airspace intrusions. North America's top defense contractors and tech companies guarantee ongoing innovation and accessibility to cutting-edge drone-detecting technologies. The region's market is growing as a result of the growing number of collaborations between defense agencies and private sector businesses to develop and implement counter-drone technologies. Due to these factors, North America is the leading market for drone detection systems during the forecast period.\nLockheed Martin Corporation (US), RTX (US), Northrop Grumman (US), Teledyne FLIR LLC, and Elbit Systems Ltd. (Israel) are the major key players in the Drone detection market. These companies have strong distribution networks across regions like North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and the Rest of the World.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: MarketsandMarkets Trademark Research Private Ltd.\nContact Person: Mr. Rohan Salgarkar\nEmail:Send Email [ https://www.abnewswire.com/email_contact_us.php?pr=drone-detection-market-worth-23299-million-by-2029-at-a-cagr-of-287 ]\nPhone: 18886006441\nAddress:1615 South Congress Ave. Suite 103, Delray Beach, FL 33445\nCity: Delray Beach\nState: Florida\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/drone-detection-market-199519485.html\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "DALLAS — The [Dallas Mavericks](/nba/dallas-mavericks) will host the Phoenix Suns on Friday night in the final contest of a five game home stand. Dallas, though, is dealing with injury trouble heading into the game. Mavericks head coach [Jason Kidd](/tag/jason-kidd) revealed that [Dereck Lively II](/tag/dereck-lively-ii) (right shoulder sprain) and [PJ Washington](/nba/players/b72909c7/pj-washington) (right knee sprain) are both out for Friday night's game. [Maxi Kleber](/nba/players/b3a50988/maxi-kleber), who is dealing with a right hamstring strain, [has been upgraded to doubtful](https://x.com/JoeyMistretta_/status/1854617163325378578), however. Washington, Kleber and [Lively all missed Wednesday's game](https://clutchpoints.com/mavericks-news-dereck-lively-ii-playing-bulls-injury-update). The Mavs still earned a 119-99 victory, but Dallas is battling injury concerns. Kleber has been limited to only two games played this season due to his hamstring injury, but the fact that he is listed as doubtful as opposed to out is encouraging. The Mavericks forward probably will not play against the Suns. His doubtful status hints that he may return sooner rather than later, though. At the very least, [Kleber is seemingly trending in a promising direction](https://clutchpoints.com/mavericks-news-maxi-kleber-injury-update-dallas-fans-attention). Lively was initially listed as questionable for Wednesday's game before later being downgraded to doubtful. He was ruled out before tip-off. Washington was ruled out on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's contest. It remains to be seen when Washington, Lively and Kleber will return. The Mavericks are not making excuses amid their injury absences, though. Rather, the team is leaning into the “next man up” mentality despite the challenging circumstances. Overall, the Mavs hold a respectable record to begin the new campaign. Dallas has not played up to their standards yet but this team projects to be extremely competitive while fully healthy. The Mavericks will look to earn another win on Friday night against the Suns. We know that Lively and Washington will not play, but there is still a chance that Kleber could take the floor, although it is doubtful. Nevertheless, his status will be worth closely monitoring.",

    "title": "Colorado senator turned Secretary of Interior sought to eliminate Native culture",
    "text": "In his annual report to Congress, submitted on Nov. 1, 1883, Secretary of Interior Henry Teller explained why he had directed the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to establish a Code of Indian Offenses.\n“If it is the purpose of the Government to civilize the Indians, they must be compelled to desist from the savage and barbarous practices that are calculated to continue them in savagery,” he proclaimed.\nTeller embraced the prevailing philosophy of his time, which was to save Native Americans by civilizing them — turning them into dark-skinned versions of Caucasian Christians. To him, that meant they had to abandon their cultural traditions.\nBy establishing the Code of Indian Offenses and Indian courts to enforce the code, Teller’s Interior Department ignored the First Amendment rights of Natives and criminalized their religious and cultural beliefs.\nThe code outlawed most Native American celebrations, such as the sun dance, scalp dance, war dance “and all other so-called feasts.” Spiritual leaders — or medicine men — were prohibited from engaging in traditional practices if those practices acted “as a hindrance to the civilization of a tribe.”\nPolygamy was outlawed. But so, too, was the tradition among many tribes that a young man seeking a wife would offer gifts such as horses, furs or game he had killed to the family of the woman he wanted to marry.\nIndians found guilty of these offenses could be imprisoned and would have their government rations withheld, which was tantamount to starvation on reservations where hunting was not an option and farming was poor.\nRobert N. Clinton, a Native American law professor, recently described the code as “the clearest evidence of a deliberate federal policy of ethnocide — the deliberate extermination of another culture.”\nIt would take 50 years before the code was partially repealed, and nearly 100 years before Natives were allowed substantial religious freedom.\nHenry Teller did not subscribe to the fanatical 19th century belief that “the only good Indian is a dead Indian.” As Secretary of Interior and as a U.S. senator, he supported some policies to aid Natives and fought against others he thought were detrimental to them.\nTeller was a vocal opponent of the view that land on Indian reservations should be removed from communal ownership of the tribe and allotted to individual Indians under the Dawes Act. He correctly predicted that providing individual land allotments would result in a land grab for non-Indians.\nTeller also worked with Colorado Springs writer and Indian advocate Helen Hunt Jackson to provide money for the Mission Indians of California, and he pushed to release federal funds that various tribes were promised under earlier treaties.\nHe was a vocal advocate for education of Indian children, but that led to his support of the Indian boarding-school system which, like the Code of Indian Offenses, attempted to eradicate Native culture. The Teller Indian School in Grand Junction was a product of that effort.\nBorn in rural New York state in 1830, Henry Moore Teller was a teacher before becoming a lawyer. In the late 1850s, he moved to Illinois and engaged in Republican politics.\nTeller’s partner caught the gold bug in 1860 and moved to Central City in what became Colorado. Johnson persuaded Teller to join in 1861. Teller married Harriet Bruce of New York in 1862 and brought her to Colorado.\nIn Central City, Teller invested in mine properties and a hotel, and he became an expert in the intricacies of mining law. He made several unsuccessful forays into local and state politics, such as supporting the first attempts to win Colorado statehood.\nBy the time Colorado became a state in 1876, he was a well-respected leader. He was elected, along with fellow Republican Jerome Chaffee, as one of the state’s first two U.S. senators.\nDuring his first five years in the Senate, Teller worked to ensure pensions were paid to Union Civil War veterans. He supported legislation to authorize new railroads in the West and to have the federal government pay for a new wagon road in southwestern Colorado.\nHe also backed legislation aimed at keeping Chinese immigrants out of the United States, and he began his decades-long battle in support of silver interests in Colorado.\nIn April 1881, President Chester Arthur chose Teller to become Secretary of the Interior, the first person from Colorado to join a president’s Cabinet.\nThe Interior Department was then the largest branch of government. One of its most contentious responsibilities was overseeing the Bureau of Indian Affairs. But Teller’s involvement with the Interior Bureau was not his first experience with Indian activities.\nIn 1863, then-Territorial Gov. John Evans appointed Teller as a major general in the Colorado militia. One year later, when Evans organized the First Colorado Cavalry under the command of Col. John Chivington, he didn’t notify Teller until after the fact.\nThere is no indication Teller knew in advance or helped plan Chivington’s infamous attack on peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians in November of 1864. But he publicly supported Chivington and his men during the national outcry that followed the Sand Creek Massacre.\nAs a senator in 1878, he lobbied hard for the Indian Bureau to hire Nathan Meeker as the agent for White River Indian Agency in northwestern Colorado. He believed Meeker’s plan to turn the Utes into sedentary farmers was the best means of “civilizing” them.\nWhen Meeker’s tenure at the White River ended with disastrous killings one year later, Teller was one of the first lawmakers to seek legislation to have the Utes removed from Colorado.\nAs Interior Secretary, he hired Josephine Meeker, daughter of Nathan Meeker and one of five people taken hostages by the Utes during the 1879 events, as his assistant private secretary. She died of pneumonia in Washington, D.C. in December 1882.\nIn 1885, Teller left the Interior Department and returned to the Senate. He gained national recognition for leading a walkout at the Republican National Convention in 1896 because he objected to the GOP platform that promoted gold over silver. He soon switched his party affiliation to Democrat.\nHe remained in the Senate until 1909, when he retired and returned to Colorado. He died on Feb. 23, 1914.\nTeller had a reputation for integrity, as well as fighting for the miners and farmers of the West. But his creation of the Code of Indian Offenses was a disaster for Native cultures. It was partially repealed by Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier in 1934, and more broadly when Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1978.\nAs Mohawk elder Katsi Cook put it in 2018, “AIRFA is the historical antidote to the U.S. government’s civilization regulations of the 1880s,” which deprived “Indigenous people and nations of our religious freedom.”\nSources: “Report of the Secretary of the Interior,” by Henry Teller, Nov. 1, 1983; “Rules Governing the Court of Indian Offenses,” by Hiram Price, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, March 30, 1883; “Code of Indian Offenses,” by Robert N.

    "text": "'(Un)lucky Sisters' Review: Netflix movie barely scratches the surface BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA: '(Un)lucky Sisters' on Netflix offers an intriguing premise- two sisters, Jesica and Angela, who don't know each other, are put together in an unforeseen situation after their estranged father dies and leaves behind a stash of millions behind a secret wall. The synopsis is compelling enough to draw your attention but will ultimately leave you disappointed. What should have been a heartfelt journey of complex relationships and moral dilemmas feels underdeveloped. Starring in lead is Sofia Morandi as Jesi and Leticia Siciliani as Angela, who navigate through their newfound sisterly bond and immense wealth that could change their fate forever. '(Un)lucky Sisters' doesn't evoke enough emotions The primary focus of the Argentinian movie is the bond between the sisters. Though there are some moments when the connection between Angela and Jesi feels authentic, it unfortunately fails to evoke enough emotions. The screenplay by Mariano Vera misses the mark. As a viewer, we might have been able to feel for the sisters if we got a glimpse of the kind of man their father was and why he was never around for his daughters. Sofia Morandi and Leticia Siciliani make honest attempt at playing their respective characters, but it goes to waste owing to the lack of depth in their characters. The brief exploration of the individual struggles of Jesi and Angela doesn't create any empathy as well. The lack of rich emotional terrain leaves us with only a superficial understanding of the complexity of this family. The predictable plot of '(Un)lucky Sisters' takes the charm away Predictability is yet another flaw of the film. Since the beginning, you can speculate how things might end for them. This brings us back to how well their journey upto the conclusion is portrayed. The discovery of massive wealth should have been a catalyst for intense drama or thrilling suspense.The tension that should have been at the story's core never fully materializes. Fabiana Tiscornia's direction feels uninspired as it fails to create any memorable cinematic moments. To sum it up, '(Un)lucky Sisters' is a disappointment. Despite the strong casting, an interesting plot, and the potential for emotional resonance, it never quite comes together. For those looking for a film that will engage and move them, there are certainly better options available. '(Un)lucky Sisters' is now available to stream on https://meaww.com/profile/netflix",

    "text": "03/10/2024 - 19:08\nA Petrobras anunciou, nesta quinta-feira (3), uma “enorme descoberta” de gás natural no Caribe colombiano, que pode duplicar as reservas do país, onde uma seca severa ameaça o abastecimento de energia.\nRealizada pela Petrobras em parceria com a estatal colombiana Ecopetrol, esta é a maior descoberta desde a década de 1990, com reservas por seis terapés cúbicos de gás, e “tem o potencial de duplicar as reservas da Colômbia”, informou o gerente-geral de Ativos Exploratórios da Petrobras, Rogério Soares, durante um evento em Cartagena (norte).\nO tamanho do reservatório é comparável ao do Campo Cuchupa em Ríohacha (norte), que forneceu gás ao país nos últimos 45 anos.\n“É uma grande conquista na história da exploração da Colômbia”, acrescentou Soares na VIII Cúpula de Petróleo, Gás e Energia, o evento mais importante da indústria no país.\nO processo de exploração ocorre há vários anos na área, mas agora é confirmado o tamanho da jazida que faz parte do projeto “Sirius”.\nO anúncio foi feito após o governo de esquerda de Gustavo Petro lançar um plano para buscar investimentos de US$ 40 bilhões (R$ 226 bilhões na cotação atual) com o objetivo de financiar a transição energética do país.\nFerrenho defensor do meio ambiente, o presidente colombiano aposta na substituição da indústria ligada aos hidrocarbonetos, um setor que representa 52% das exportações nacionais.\nO ministro de Minas e Energia, Andrés Camacho, comemorou a “descoberta de gás” em mensagem na rede social X. “Nossa política de eficiência na gestão de hidrocarbonetos avança com sucesso”, acrescentou.\n– Transição energética –\nA Colômbia atravessa uma temporada de calor incomum, que aumentou o risco de escassez de energia e apagões, alertam especialistas.\nPetro freou a exploração de hidrocarbonetos para priorizar fontes renováveis como a energia solar e eólica. Contudo, a oposição e um setor da indústria consideram que esta decisão poderia colocar em risco a autossuficiência energética do país.\nSegundo dados da Naturgas, sindicato nacional das empresas de gás, em 2025 o país terá um déficit deste hidrocarboneto equivalente a 7,5% da demanda total e, em 2026, aumentará para 16%.\nEm meio à crise hídrica gerada pelo fenômeno climático El Niño, a Colômbia aumentou suas importações de gás em 2.500% entre 2022 e 2023. O gás natural representa entre 25% e 30% da demanda nacional por energia, segundo números do setor.\nEm 2023, as reservas comprovadas de gás do país eram de 2.373 gigapés cúbicos (Gpc), segundo dados oficiais.\nA Colômbia sediará em outubro a COP16 sobre biodiversidade, onde o governo pretende dar destaque internacional ao seu projeto de transição energética.\n“O mundo deve compreender que a nossa resolução de cuidar deste território gera serviços ambientais estratégicos” para o planeta em meio à crise climática, disse nesta quarta-feira a ministra do Meio Ambiente, Susana Muhamad, durante um evento na cidade de Barranquilla (norte) chamado “Feira de Economias para a Vida”.",
