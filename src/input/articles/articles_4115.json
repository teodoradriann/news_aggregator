    "text": "On the 15th, ‌Rodong Sinmun, the ⁢organ of ⁢the​ North Korean Workers’ ‌Party, reported, “Comrade Kim Jong-un‌ led the performance test of various self-destructive⁤ attack drones produced by research institutes and enterprises under the Unmanned Aerial Technology Association on the 14th.”⁣ (Pyongyang Rodong Sinmun‍ = News 1) North ⁢Korean Workers’ Party General Secretary Kim‍ Jong-un led performance tests of suicide attack drones and ordered “mass production.” It has been three months since the self-destruction drone performance test was inspected last August.\nOn the 15th, the Labor Party’s official newspaper, Rodong‌ Sinmun, reported, “On the 14th, Comrade Kim Jong-un‍ led local performance tests of ​various suicide attack-type drones produced by research institutes and enterprises under the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Technology Association.”\nSecretary General Kim expressed ‌satisfaction​ with the tactical and technical characteristics and specifications of the developed unmanned aerial vehicles and ordered, “We will‍ establish an affiliated production system as soon as possible⁣ and begin full-scale mass production.”\n“The‌ competition to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a means of military power‌ is accelerating around the world,” he said. “With low production costs​ and simple production processes, it is becoming easier to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a component of strike power in new areas.” He emphasized that development is an ‘essential requirement’ from a military perspective.\n⁤\nThe newspaper claimed that in this test, various unmanned aerial vehicles flew on tactical routes ‍with ​different strike ranges and made ‘ precision strikes ‘ on targets. ​It is said‍ that these drones can be used both on land and at‌ sea.\nOn this day,⁣ General Secretary Kim evaluated that there was ‘possibility and potential to produce and introduce various unmanned aerial vehicles’ and said, “We will find the prospect of combining and applying new and promising tactical methods in terms of tactical law to suit the needs of modern warfare.”\nOn the 15th, the Rodong Sinmun, the The newspaper reported that on this ‌day, General Secretary Kim said, ⁢“We are continuing to supplement the⁤ line to perfectly combine unmanned armed equipment systems⁣ with ‘operational plans’ and ‘principles of engagement,’” and “expressed the Party ​Central Committee’s plan for the development of unmanned armed equipment.”⁢ “He presented an‍ important strategic policy ‍for its⁢ implementation,” the‍ report said.\nThe ‘Unmanned Aerial Technology Alliance’ visited by General Secretary Kim is a place that​ has⁤ not been highlighted in the⁣ North Korean media so far, and the newspaper said about it, “The Unmanned​ Aerial Technology Alliance is a place where the plenary meetings of ⁣the Party Central Committee and the Party Central Military Committee give decision ⁢orders to the defense logistics ⁤sector.” “We are achieving‌ remarkable results in ‌promoting the things we have done,” he said. It appears to be⁢ an organization that will develop new technologies in the unmanned aerial vehicle sector​ and take charge of mass production in ⁣the future.\nLast August, Secretary General Kim provided field guidance to the Academy of Defense Development’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Research Center and urged it to produce‌ more various types of self-destructive‍ UAVs, nuclear torpedoes, and‍ attack-type unmanned aerial ⁢vehicles.\nAccording to⁤ photos released by the newspaper that ‌day, a drone blew up a ⁢tank⁢ and a car. Additionally, some of the drones appear to be similar to those unveiled last August.\nOn the same day, General Secretary Kim provided on-site guidance to the local industrial factory construction site‍ in Jaeryeong-gun,⁢ South Hwanghae Province and ordered, “We must enter ⁣production and produce results as soon as construction is completed.”\nSecretary⁤ General Kim toured the construction ⁤sites‌ of food factories and daily necessities factories, inspecting construction patterns and equipment manufacturing and assembly conditions.\nAs the end ⁤of the year approaches,⁢ General Secretary ‍Kim said, “It is ‌important for all constructors to increase⁢ their\n“The quality level must be completely guaranteed,”​ he emphasized.\nIn⁢ addition, ‌“This project should not ‌be purely about summarizing performance,” he said. “We must manufacture at the highest quality level and responsibly conduct ⁤installation and test runs ⁣to ensure​ full operation and full load of all facilities ‌from ⁢the ⁤first stage of factory operation.” He ⁢emphasized.\nAt the same time, it is said that directions and methods to solve⁢ problems related to operational preparation were also presented.\nThe newspaper‌ reported that Cho Yong-won, Kim Yong-su, ⁢Kim Yo-jong,​ Park Seong-cheol, and People’s Army ⁤General General Park Gwang-ju​ accompanied the Jaeryeong-gun field guidance, and were greeted ⁢by local industrial minister Cho Yong-cheol, the responsible secretary of the Jaeryeong County Committee of South Hwanghae Province, the ⁢chairman of the‌ People’s Committee, and commanders ‍of ‌military units mobilized for construction.\nThis year, General Secretary Kim presented the ‘Local Development 20 As this is the first year, it appears that they are directly inspecting this project​ and urging ​results.\nWhat are the potential consequences of North Korea’s increased focus ‍on military drone technology? Interview between Time.news Editor and ‌Military Drone Expert\nTime.news Editor: ‍Welcome ⁢to our feature interview, where we delve into significant developments in global security and defense ​technology. Today, we’re⁤ joined by Dr. Sarah Choi, a leading expert in military drone technology. Dr. Choi, thank you for⁢ being⁣ here.\nDr. Choi: Thank you⁢ for having⁤ me! It’s a pleasure to⁤ discuss this vital topic.\nEditor: Let’s dive right in. Recently, North Korea’s ⁤state media ‌reported‌ that Kim Jong-un is pushing for the mass ‌production​ of suicide attack drones. This⁣ follows performance tests he led, which ⁤seemed to demonstrate the drones’ combat capabilities. Given the global race for UAV ⁤technology, what does⁢ this mean for military strategy in the region?\nDr. ‌Choi: ‍ It underscores a significant shift in modern ⁤warfare paradigms. North Korea is not just ⁤ramping up its capabilities but also signaling to the world⁢ that it’s serious about using UAVs as a core component of its military strategy. The low production costs and ​the relative ease of deploying drones make⁤ them an increasingly attractive option for militaries, especially in asymmetric warfare scenarios.\nEditor: The report emphasized ⁢the drones’ ability to operate on land and‌ at⁤ sea. ⁢How critical is this versatility for military operations?\nDr.⁢ Choi: ‌Extremely critical. The ‌ability for drones‌ to operate in various environments allows​ for more flexible and adaptive strategies. It means that North Korea ⁤could potentially deploy these drones in diverse combat scenarios—land ⁢invasions, maritime warfare, and even against unconventional threats. This versatility ​can elevate North Korea’s tactical ​options⁣ significantly.\nEditor: Kim ⁢Jong-un stated ⁣that the⁣ development of these drones‌ is​ an “essential ⁤requirement” from a military perspective. From your understanding, how do⁤ you ⁢interpret this urgency?\nDr. Choi: ​This urgency ⁤reflects a recognition of the changing dynamics in military conflict. Drones are becoming indispensable tools for surveillance, precision strikes, ‍and force multiplication. For​ a state ⁢like‍ North‌ Korea,‍ which faces significant power disparities against more technologically advanced nations, rapidly developing and deploying such technology can help⁢ level the playing ⁢field.\nEditor: The article also mentioned that Kim expressed satisfaction⁣ with the drones’ tactical and ​technical characteristics. What specific capabilities are critical for these types of drones?\nDr. Choi: For suicide attack drones, critical capabilities include precision targeting, reliability under various operational conditions, ⁣and the ability to evade counter-drone measures. ⁣Additionally, ‌having⁣ a robust​ guidance system, whether GPS-based or employing advanced autonomous‌ navigation technologies, is‍ crucial for ensuring successful ⁢missions.\nEditor: Given⁣ this ⁢emphasis on developing advanced drone technology, what implications does this have for international relations in ⁣the region, particularly with South Korea and the United ⁢States?\nDr. ⁤Choi: The advancement of North Korean UAV ⁣capabilities escalates tensions, particularly with South Korea and the U.S. It could lead to an arms race ⁤in⁣ UAV technology across ​the region. Additionally,⁤ it​ may prompt preemptive measures or counter-strikes, which could further destabilize the‌ situation. Countries that feel threatened may argue for ‍increased⁢ missile defense systems or ‍enhanced ​capabilities ⁣of their military forces.\nEditor: In light of these developments, what can be done to mitigate‍ risks associated with the proliferation of UAV technology⁣ in unstable regions like ⁢North‍ Korea?\nDr. Choi: Diplomatic channels must remain open, emphasizing ‍dialogue around arms control⁢ and⁢ non-proliferation. Engaging‌ North Korea in discussions about responsible drone use could pave ⁣the way for greater transparency and decrease ‌the likelihood of conflict. Furthermore,​ collaborating on‌ international standards for drone technology could help manage the risks ​of deployment and misuse.\nEditor: ‌ Thank you, Dr. Choi, for your valuable insights. It’s clear that the developments in ‌North Korea concerning ‍drone technology carry significant weight on multiple levels—from military strategy to international relations.\nDr. Choi: ​ Absolutely, and ​thank you for ‍having me. These discussions are crucial as ⁤the landscape of global⁤ security continues‍ to evolve.\nEditor: And ⁤thank you ‌to our viewers for joining us today. Stay tuned for⁣ more updates⁢ on crucial ⁢developments ⁢around the world.",

    "text": "\nThe announcement from the Vatican last week that priests would be\npermitted to bless same-sex couples shook the Catholic Church. The Vatican declaration made clear (as countess faithful Catholics have pointed out, including myself) that the Church’s moral teachings and doctrines on homosexuality would remain unchanged and that, in the name of “pastoral charity,” only the individuals in same-sex relationships could be blessed — the relationships themselves could not be, as the Church considers such relationships to be sinful. But just as theological conservatives warned would happen, progressive priests have made the anomaly the norm.\nProgressive priests and bishops have long pushed the proverbial envelope, diluting the perennial moral and theological instructions of the Catholic Church.\nQuoting from Pope Francis, the Vatican declaration states, “Decisions that may be part of pastoral prudence in certain circumstances should not necessarily become a norm.” But even the Pope’s words won’t halt agenda-driven ideologues in Roman collars. (READ MORE from S.A. McCarthy:\nAnthony Fauci and the Apostate’s Arrogance)\nProminent\nLGBT activist and Jesuit priest James Martin publicly offered a blessing to a gay couple with whom he’s close. Although the Vatican’s declaration explicates that such blessings should be “spontaneous” and must be sought by the individuals, Martin texted Damian and Jason Steidl Jack after the declaration’s publication, asking them if they would like their “marriage” blessed. So much for obedience to Rome.\nStan Zerkowski, director of LGBTQ+ ministry at St. Paul Catholic Church in Lexington,\nquipped that the Vatican declaration “says to the LGBTQ community we see you not only as individuals but as couples,” despite the declaration specifically clarifying that it is not meant to “somehow offer a form of moral legitimacy to a union that presumes to be a marriage or to an extra-marital sexual practice.” Controversial Chicago-area priest Michael Pfleger, who has been accused of sexual abuse by at least four men, told a gay couple at his parish that he would be “honored” to “bless their union,” according to reports. Pfleger’s archbishop, Cardinal Blase Cupich, hailed the declaration’s provisions as “a step forward.” But a step towards what?\nLGBTQ apologists are already subverting the clear, literal meaning of the groundbreaking declaration to abuse its provisions in service to their rainbow agenda. They will not be prevented from doing so, either. Towards its conclusion, the Vatican’s declaration states:\nWhat has been said in this Declaration regarding the blessings of same-sex couples is sufficient to guide the prudent and fatherly discernment of ordained ministers in this regard. Thus, beyond the guidance provided above, no further responses should be expected about possible ways to regulate details or practicalities regarding blessings of this type.\nThere will be no “inquisition,” there will be no clarification, there will be no accountability — not from Rome. There will only be moral chaos and liturgical abuse. Such an outcome was easily foreseeable and is, in fact, not unexpected, especially for those who know their Church history. (READ MORE:\nPope to Oust American Cardinal From Rome Residence)\nIn 1969, for example, Pope St. Paul VI\nissued “Memoriale Domini, the Instruction on the Manner of Administering Holy Communion.” In it, he debated allowing Holy Communion to be distributed in the hand instead of being placed directly on the tongue. After a staggering 1,233 bishops advised against doing so, the Pontiff reiterated that the Body and Blood of Christ are of such sacred nature that every reverence must be shown, and Holy Communion ought therefore be received only on the tongue. The Pope allowed bishops in areas where receiving Holy Communion in the hand was already the existing practice, such as France, Belgium, and Germany, to determine whether or not they would allow the practice to continue. As with all things liturgical and theological, progressive priests made the exception into the new rule.\nSimilarly, the Second Vatican Council\ndeclared in no uncertain terms that Gregorian chant was “proper to the Roman rite” and “should be given pride of place” in the celebration of the Novus Ordo Mass. The Council warned that, although “other musical settings,” including more modern tunes, might be “used as the occasion demands,” still “the introduction into the celebration of anything which is merely secular, or which is hardly compatible with divine worship, under the guise of solemnity should be carefully avoided.”\nYet once again, guitars and tambourines dominated Masses for the following two generations or more, sometimes accompanied by the abominable practice of liturgical dancing. Some parishes still insist on making the music of the Mass sound like the soundtrack for a Vietnam War film. When was the last time that Gregorian chant was heard in the usual local parish? Progressive priests and their episcopal enablers made the exception into the rule.\nBy the grace of God, there are priests and bishops this time around who are fed up enough with the license that progressives make of exceptions and ambiguities. Archbishop Tomash Peta and Bishop Athanasius Schneider, both of Saint Mary in Astana, Kazakhstan, have already\nbanned priests of the archdiocese from administering the blessings referred to in the Vatican’s new declaration, which they say would turn the Church into, “in practice, a propagandist of the globalist and ungodly ‘gender ideology.’”\nNumerous African bishops have likewise banned the practice, citing (perhaps with tongue in cheek) “pastoral prudence,” the very mechanism by which Pope Francis’s pontificate approved blessing same-sex couples. (Thus far, faithful bishops in\nGhana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda have forbidden their priests from offering same-sex blessings.) Poland’s bishops have done the same, and the Catholic bishops of Ukraine warned that the declaration’s ambiguities may be used to infer Vatican approval for same-sex relationships.(READ MORE: Jesuit Priest Declares Donald Trump an Antichrist)\nProgressive priests and bishops have long pushed the proverbial envelope, diluting the perennial moral and theological instructions of the Catholic Church. Just as there have been (at least a few) priests and bishops bold enough to correct them in the past, so there are today. The difference is that, since the progressives have taken exceptions as license to formulate new rules, they now dominate the College of Cardinals and most bishops’ conferences, and their theological and “pastoral” licentiousness will be perpetrated with impunity, damning untold hundreds and thousands of souls in the name of “inclusion.” All are welcome in the Catholic Church, of course, but on Christ’s terms, not their own. All are also welcome in Hell, on anyone’s terms but Christ’s.",

    "text": "Our existence now exists in greater public view than ever before. Through Twitter, we can publish our thoughts instantly to global audiences. Sharing at this level exposes us to potential public criticism when we post something offensive, or we wish we hadn’t said. Using tweet deletion as a way to hide mistakes seems convenient, yet constant tweet deletion produces psychological stress for individuals. The following text examines the psychological effects that regular tweet deletions create, together with practical methods to handle such situations.\nThe Stress of the Online Spotlight Having an online audience can be validating, but it also creates pressure to curate what we share carefully. Researchers have found that the drive for self-presentation and feeling constantly visible to others online can negatively impact mental health . People who actively manage their online identities by deleting content or using the “ tweet delete ” strategy show higher levels of distress. This suggests that trying to control how we are perceived tightly is a significant source of stress.\nThe guilt and shame we feel when we share things we later regret also play a role. One study found that the more people cared about managing their online personas, the more embarrassed they felt about errors and oversharing online. This public self-consciousness amplifies feelings of regret.\nIn essence, we stress both before and after we hit tweet—worrying about self-presentation and feeling embarrassed if we fail to get it right. This cycle takes a toll.\nThe Urge to Undo and Delete When we share something online that results in criticism, anger, or misunderstanding, deleting it can feel like the best option. Hitting delete provides an instant sense of relief—out of sight, out of mind. However, research suggests that the act of deleting content repeatedly in response to negative reactions may not be as harmless as it seems.\nPsychologists, along with neuroscientists, warn social anxiety becomes stronger through this behavior. The fear of judgment causes us to remove posts and tweets, which trains our brains to link sharing with shame. Online self-censorship develops into a perpetual pattern that causes people to stop sharing themselves entirely on the Internet. Research indicates users who rid their platforms of posts after negative feedback experiences generally develop reduced self-esteem and struggle with social assurance problems.\nIn other words, while deleting tweets may seem harmless on the surface, it can quietly undermine users’ confidence and increase self-doubt in the long run.\nCoping with Online Scrutiny in Healthy Ways Deleting content by itself does not cause problems. We all commit errors that we afterward regret sharing. When users actively remove tweets to manage how others perceive them, the level of anxiety increases. Here are some healthy coping strategies to balance authentic self-expression with public scrutiny:\nAccept that criticism and misunderstandings happen online. Our messages rarely reach people exactly as we mean them to. View every single negative reaction independently from other comments. Identify one item that causes discomfort so you can understand and solve it. Avoid reflexively deleting content when distressed. Pause, process emotions, and then revisit the content with fresh eyes. Often, we realize that criticism is not as severe as it first appeared. Consider if you can clarify your thoughts before deleting them. Many online misunderstandings can be resolved with open communication rather than withdrawal. Develop self-compassion around your errors and oversharing. We all make mistakes; this is part of being human. Recognize shame as an unhelpful emotion. Focus less on chasing external validation through self-presentation. Tying our self-worth too closely to outside perceptions is inherently anxiety-inducing. Owner empowerment of authentic self-expression should coexist with a deliberate reduction of anxiety about how others view you. Avoid both a reactive and absolutely self-conscious approach to your behavior. Develop your ability to recognize when you fall into either obsessive reaction pattern. The practice of accepting your inner experiences alongside outside reactions with grace builds both confidence and reduces your need to manage your appearance constantly.\nThe Impact of Frequent Tweet Deleting on Mental Health While the occasional deletion of regrettable tweets is normal, repeated and reactive deleting can undermine well-being over time. Studies suggest this excessive behavior is linked to:\nIncreased social anxiety and self-consciousness. Heightened feelings of inauthenticity. Reduced self-compassion. Greater sensitivity to criticism. More self-censoring to avoid potential negative reactions. When we delete our tweets often, this creates a neural association between sharing information and experiencing shame. The process of steadily eliminating self-expression triggers fear of judgment by others. The more we judge ourselves for our online actions, the stronger our doubts become about revealing our authentic selves.\nIn the long term, this practice causes a compulsive pattern of checking notifications and analytics to assess outside perceptions. Our search for validation begins as we start mindlessly presenting ourselves to others. When self-worth becomes linked with external factors beyond our control, it produces unavoidable emotional swings.\nIn this way, excessive tweet deleting exacerbates the common problem of relying too heavily on external feedback for confidence and assurance. Learning self-validation and self-compassion circumvents this exhausting cycle.\nBuilding Self-Confidence to Counter Public Scrutiny Excessive tweet deletion often stems from a lack of self-confidence and reliance on outside perceptions for esteem. Building genuine self-worth can curb this unhealthy behavior. Here are some starting points:\nSeparate self-assurance from public validation. Tying self-image to outside feedback is a rollercoaster. Cultivate inner security. Accept that scrutiny is part of visibility. It isn’t personal. Release excessive self-consciousness about perceptions. Develop self-compassion around errors. Progress requires risk-taking. Don’t let perfectionism stifle you. Clarify your core values. Knowing what matters most insulates you from irrelevant criticism. Focus less on self-presentation. Chasing validation through curation is exhausting. Prioritize authenticity. The more we can ground our self-image in clarity of values and self-acceptance, the less threatened we feel by public judgments. Scrutiny influences us only as much as we let it. Learning to validate ourselves internally is the greatest buffer against external criticism.\nHealthy Approaches for Businesses and Public Figures For entrepreneurs, executives and public influencers facing frequent public scrutiny, balancing authentic sharing with self-care is essential. Here are some best practices:\nAccept visibility has risks. Handling criticism is part of leadership, especially online. Focus less on universal likability. You can’t control all perceptions. Stay true to your vision. Build self-confidence beyond validation. Not everyone will applaud you. Inner clarity and purpose help weather storms. Remember, scrutiny often stems from envy. Your success naturally threatens some. Don’t let this shake you. Cultivate a support network. Trusted friends and mentors provide reality checks when self-doubt creeps in. Unplug occasionally. Time offline helps keep scrutiny in perspective so it doesn’t overshadow your sense of self. The core skill for public figures is learning to validate yourself enough internally so that outside perceptions don’t control your self-worth or direction. This frees you to take the risks required for innovation and progress.\nThe Bottom Line The advantages of online public visibility come with the burden of enduring continuous public review, which demands personal strength to withstand it. Deleting tweets occasionally brings no harm, yet compulsive deleting triggered by criticism develops anxiety and self-consciousness that grows gradually with time. A healthy way to manage challenges demands confidence that grows through knowing yourself and accepting who you are. The path to progress demands authentic behavior even when people fight against it. Public figures can maintain both their direction and personal identity through the development of appropriate competence to resist criticism effectively.",
