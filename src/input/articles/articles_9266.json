    "title": "Biden is not banning portable gas generators",
    "text": "Many people prepare for severe weather such as snowstorms, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes by buying a portable gas-powered generator to use in case of a power outage.\nThose generators can be lifesavers for some, but can also be deadly for others. Since 2010, portable generators have caused 796 deaths related to carbon monoxide poisoning.\nOver the past year, several headlines and social media posts have claimed that the Biden administration wants to ban portable gas-powered generators.\nTHE QUESTION Is the Biden administration banning portable gas-powered generators?\nTHE SOURCES U.S. Federal Register U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) Portable Generator Manufacturers’ Association (PGMA) UL Solutions , which created one of two voluntary standards for the portable generator industry Ashley Rodrigue, director of public affairs at the Louisiana Office of State Fire Marshal THE ANSWER No, the Biden administration is not banning portable gas-powered generators.\nSign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts newsletter here .\nWHAT WE FOUND In response to numerous carbon monoxide poisoning deaths and injuries caused by portable gas-powered generators, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) proposed a rule in March 2023 that would regulate the carbon monoxide emissions and auto-shutoff sensitivity of new portable gas-powered generators.\nThe CPSC is an independent federal agency tasked with regulating consumer product safety.\nThis regulation would not ban portable gas-powered generators, but would instead require manufacturers to meet new standards when manufacturing portable generators. The rule combines two preexisting industry standards that portable generator manufacturers can currently voluntarily follow.\nThere is no current set date when the rule would go into effect, but the CPSC says its staff are working on the next step of the proposal.\nAs written, it would not apply to generators currently in homes or on store shelves.\nCarbon monoxide is a toxic gas that is odorless and colorless, often referred to as a “silent killer” because of its ability to cause harm while going unnoticed, the CPSC says.\nA portable gas-powered generator can produce as much carbon monoxide as 100 cars lined up side-by-side, according to Ashley Rodrigue, director of public affairs at the Louisiana Office of State Fire Marshal. That amount of carbon monoxide can quickly become dangerous if the generator is left in a space like a garage, even with the door open.\n“It can seep into your home through door cracks, window cracks, any kind of opening into your attic, which can then spread across your home,” Rodrigue said. “It's a very dangerous situation that can develop very quickly. This is not something that is going to happen over days, this is over hours. And it can be as quick — depending upon where that generator is placed, and how big it is — it can be as quick as three hours.”\nThe rule would require portable gas-powered generator manufacturers to include a carbon monoxide sensor that automatically shuts off the generator when it detects certain levels of carbon monoxide around it. It would also require manufacturers to limit the carbon monoxide emissions produced by their generators.\nThe CPSC proposed the rule to try to reduce carbon monoxide deaths and injuries caused by portable generators. Generators caused 92 of the 211 non-fire carbon monoxide poisoning deaths from consumer products in 2020, the most of any product category, according to the CPSC .\nCurrently, portable gas-powered generator manufacturers can voluntarily abide by two different industry standards. The standard most commonly followed by the manufacturers is the PGMA standard , which requires generators to include a carbon monoxide detector that automatically shuts the generator off. The other standard, the UL standard , not only requires the sensor and automatic shut-off feature, but also limits the amount of carbon monoxide a generator can produce.\nAccording to the Portable Generator Manufacturers’ Association (PGMA) , the rule could temporarily cause a shortage of portable generators if it were to go through.\nHowever, the PGMA says there are no portable generators currently on the market that would meet the CPSC’s proposed regulations.\nThe PGMA claims that over 75% of generators available on the market have the carbon monoxide detection and shut-off required for the PGMA standard, and expects compliance to grow 85% within the next year. CPSC staff, on the other hand, estimated that only about 30% of generators are compliant with the PGMA standard.\n“There are currently no generators in the market that comply with the requirements of the proposed rule,” the PGMA said. “The 180-day effective date required by the rule is not enough time for manufacturers to redesign, re-develop, test, and bring new generators to market.”\nThe PGMA updated its voluntary standards in December 2023 to require the carbon monoxide sensor to shut off the generator at a lower level of carbon monoxide. The updated standards do not limit the amount of carbon monoxide a generator can produce.\nThe CPSC’s notice of proposed rulemaking notes that it cannot legally issue a rule if there are already voluntary standards adopted by the industry, unless the CPSC finds the standards don’t adequately “eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury” from a product or believes significant compliance with the voluntary standard is unlikely.\nThe rule has not been adopted or finalized since it was first proposed in March 2023.",

    "text": "In a landmark announcement that promises to redefine the cultural and spiritual landscape of Karnataka, the state government has earmarked a whopping Rs 100 crore for the holistic development of Anjanadri Hill, the revered birthplace of Lord Hanuman, located in the Koppal district. This ambitious initiative, announced by the Karnataka Chief Minister during the state budget, extends beyond conventional tourism enhancement. It encompasses the revival of ancient water supply systems and the establishment of interpretation centers, aiming to enrich the experience of every visitor and pilgrim to this sacred site.\nReviving Heritage, Fostering Spirituality\nThe development plan for Anjanadri Hill is not just about infrastructural enhancement but is a comprehensive approach to reinvigorate and preserve the rich mythological and historical essence of the region. Anjanadri Hill, nestled near Anegundi, is not only a testament to the panoramic beauty of Karnataka's landscapes but also stands as a significant pillar of India's spiritual heritage, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman, also known as Anjaneya. The government's vision extends to the construction of residential complexes for devotees journeying to various pilgrimage destinations, ensuring their spiritual quest is accompanied by comfort and serenity.\nA Blend of Tradition and Modernity\nThe initiative also looks forward to promoting adventure tourism, water sports, coastal tourism, and the research and restoration of archaeological monuments, signifying a blend of tradition and modernity. This multidimensional approach not only aims to spotlight Anjanadri Hill’s spiritual significance but also to unveil the untapped potential of the region as a hub for diverse tourism activities. Furthermore, the establishment of separate authorities for the development of Sri Ghati Subramanyaswamy temple in Bengaluru Rural district and Huligemma temple in Koppal district, alongside a 'vision group' for the upliftment of 'C' category historical temples, reflects a holistic vision towards preserving Karnataka's cultural heritage.\nInfrastructure Development and Connectivity\nRecognizing the importance of accessibility to these sacred sites, the government has announced substantial infrastructure projects including a bridge-cum-barrage near Chikkamanchale village in Raichur district. This strategic project, undertaken by the Public Works Department, aims to provide seamless connectivity to Mantralaya, enhancing the pilgrimage experience for devotees. The comprehensive development plan signifies a leap towards not only preserving the spiritual ethos of the region but also catalyzing socio-economic growth through enhanced tourism and pilgrimage activities.\nThe Karnataka government's robust allocation of Rs 100 crore for the development of Anjanadri Hill and surrounding areas of Koppal district marks a significant milestone in the state's commitment to preserving its rich cultural and spiritual heritage. By intertwining the revival of ancient traditions with the promotion of modern tourism and infrastructure enhancement, this initiative promises to transform Anjanadri Hill into a beacon of spiritual and cultural tourism, not just in Karnataka, but across the country. As the project unfolds, it is set to open new horizons for the region, promising a blend of spiritual solace, cultural enrichment, and economic prosperity for the local communities.",

The official Bushfire Danger Period in the shire and Illawarra began on October 1. RFS Inspector David Bartlett said the declaration meant affected residents should make and discuss their bush fire survival plan. \"Having a bush fire survival plan will ensure all members of the household know what to do on days of increased fire danger and what to do if their home is threatened by fire,\" he said. \"Residents should prepare their property by removing flammable materials from their yards, clearing leaves from gutters, checking hoses can reach all around the house and where appropriate, conducting hazard reduction activities. \"Never leave a fire unattended and if a fire does escape, it is essential to call Triple Zero (000) immediately so that emergency services can respond accordingly and minimise the damage.\" During the Bush Fire Danger period, landowners and managers are required to obtain a Fire Permit from their local Fire Control Centre before lighting any fires, including hazard reduction burns. Fire permit applications can be completed online by visiting the NSW Rural Fire Service website. On days of Total Fire Ban all Bush Fire Hazard Reduction Certificates are automatically revoked. Information about hazard reduction burning and required notifications is available on the RFS website at: rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/BFDP",

    "text": "Just as Victor Wembanyama was coming off his first NBA All-Star appearance, the basketball world got the news Thursday that the Spurs ' 21-year-old star would miss the rest of the 2024-25 season.\nWembanyama — who is dealing with a deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder according to ESPN's Shams Charania — was in the midst of a dominant sophomore campaign, averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds and a league-leading 3.8 blocks per game.\nWhile Wembanyama's season-ending injury is disappointing for the Spurs and the NBA in general, it may also have further implications on his financial future.\nHere's how Wembanyama missing the rest of the 2024-25 season could affect his potential contract extension with San Antonio in the coming years.\nMORE: The latest injury updates on Victor Wembanyama\nVictor Wembanyama contract extension Wembanyama, in his second season after being selected first overall by San Antonio in the 2023 NBA Draft, has two years left on his rookie deal. Per Spotrac , he'll carry a $13,376,880 cap hit in 2025-26, then a $16,868,246 cap hit in 2026-27, when the Spurs are likely to exercise his team option.\nIn the 2026 offseason, Wembanyama will become eligible for a five-year, $271 million rookie extension, per ESPN . The star center could still increase the value of that extension to $326 million, but his recent injury will make that a bit tougher.\nBecause he'll miss the rest of the season, Wembanyama will be ineligible for NBA awards, including the Defensive Player of the Year award he was heavily favored to earn , as he'll play in fewer than 65 games.\nThe consequence of that missed time, and lack of awards, will extend into Wembanyama's future extension. Due to what's called the NBA's \"Rose rule,\" Wembanyama will have to have an elite 2026-27 season to increase his extension by more than $50 million in total.\nMORE: How Victor Wembanyama's injury could impact Spurs' Draft Lottery chances\nWhat is the Rose rule? The NBA has a rule in its CBA that doesn't officially have a name but is commonly referred to as the Rose rule — named after Derrick Rose, who won the 2011 MVP award in his third NBA season with the Bulls .\nUnder the Rose rule, players that are finishing their rookie contracts, as Wembanyama will be in a few years, are able to sign a maximum-salary contract that exceeded the usual limit for an NBA player with under seven years of experience. Rather than the usual 25%, these players on rookie contracts are eligible to sign a max contract worth 30% of the salary cap.\nYet only players that meet certain awards criteria in their first few seasons are eligible for the expanded max contracts under the Rose rule. Per Hoops Rumors , a player becomes eligible for the 30% max contract entering their fifth season when at least one of the following is true:\nThe player was named to an All-NBA team in the most recent season, or in two of the past three seasons. The player was named Defensive Player of the Year in the most recent season, or in two of the past three seasons. The player was named Most Valuable Player in any of the past three seasons. The Rose rule max extension can only be applied to extensions lasting at least four new years. Teams also do not have to sign a player to the 30% max contract even if they're eligible, as they could also agree to a deal in the 25-30% range of the salary cap — 30% is just the max.\nPlayers can also agree to conditional salaries that hinge on the player's performance in their fourth season, which is before the extension begins, based on which All-NBA team the player lands on.\nIn Wembanyama's case, he will not have any All-NBA appearances, Defensive Player of the Year awards or MVP awards by the end of the 2024-25 season (his second season) due to his season-ending injury and him missing the 65-game threshold.\nThat means when he becomes eligible to sign his contract extension in the 2026 offseason, he will not have more than one All-NBA appearance or Defensive Player of the Year award. To become eligible for the 30% max contract extension under the Rose rule, Wembanyama would have to do at least one of the following before his fifth season in 2027-28:\nBe selected to an All-NBA team in the 2026-27 season Be selected as the Defensive Player of the Year in the 2026-27 season Be selected as the league's MVP in either the 2025-26 season or 2026-27 season Even if Wembanyama is named to an All-NBA team or wins Defensive Player of the Year in 2025-26, he would still have to do the same in 2026-27 to earn the 30% max contract, as the Rose rule requires a player to either earn those honors in two of their last three seasons or in their fourth season alone.\nThe only way Wembanyama will be able to secure his larger extension with the Spurs next season is by winning MVP. Otherwise, his contract size could entirely depend on the awards he earns in 2026-27.",
