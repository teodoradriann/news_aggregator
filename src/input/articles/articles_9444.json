    "text": "MOUNT MAUNGANUI: New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner took four wickets as they beat Bangladesh by 17 runs in a rain-affected third and final Twenty20 international on Sunday to draw the series 1-1. After dismissing the tourists for 110 in Mount Maunganui, New Zealand´s top-order collapsed to 49-5 before Jimmy Neesham and Santner recovered to reach 95-5 off 14.4 overs. When heavy rain halted play, the Black Caps were comfortably ahead of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern target, thanks largely to an unbeaten 28 from all-rounder Neesham. The result denied Bangladesh a first series victory on New Zealand soil in any format, having lost the preceding ODI series 2-1. “Our bowlers did the job up front keeping them to 110 and it´s good to get across the line in what´s been a pretty tough-fought series,” Santner said. “It got quite tight in the end today. Credit to Bangladesh, their bowlers have bowled extremely well. They put us under some real pressure again.” After asking Bangladesh to bat first on a lively Bay Oval pitch, Santner claimed 4-16 off his four overs, stifling an innings that was already struggling at 41-3 when he was introduced. Seamers Tim Southee, Adam Milne and Ben Sears all took two wickets. Milne (2-23) removed Bangladesh captain and top-scorer Najmul Hossain Shanto for 17 when he skied a full-pitched delivery to point. Shanto rued the fact that he and four other Bangladesh batsmen reached double figures, but all failed to convert into a substantial score. “The bowlers did a great job but the batsmen didn´t get runs today,” he said. “In T20s the top of the order is very important. Our batsmen got starts, like 15 or 17, but they´re not taking the game deep.” Four of New Zealand´s top order were dismissed for one run and when Finn Allen followed after scoring 38, Neesham held the innings together as the storm clouds gathered, with solid support from Santner who was unbeaten on 18. Seam bowler Shoriful Islam took 2-17 off 3.4 overs. Bangladesh won the first game in Napier on Wednesday by five wickets, before Friday´s second match was abandoned after 11 overs because of rain in Mount Maunganui.",

    "text": "PARÍS.- Hace 80 años, al amanecer del martes 6 de junio de 1944, comenzaba la mayor operación naval de la historia : participaban 6939 buques de guerra. Después del lanzamiento nocturno de 23.000 paracaidistas detrás de las líneas alemanas, unos 136.000 soldados estadounidenses, canadienses y británicos, que habían partido del puerto inglés de Portsmouth, se lanzarían bajo un diluvio de fuego al asalto de cinco playas de las costas atlánticas de la Normandía francesa, rebautizadas para la ocasión Utah, Omaha, Sword, Juno y Gold . Las pérdidas humanas fueron enormes (10.000 muertos, heridos o desaparecidos), pero menos importantes que lo previsto por el Estado Mayor aliado. Ocho décadas más tarde, en la misma playa de Omaha, la “sangrienta”, los aliados se reencontraron este jueves sin Rusia, pero junto al presidente de Ucrania, Volodimir Zelensky, para celebrar la victoria contra el nazismo , en momentos en que la guerra azota nuevamente a Europa .\nVeinticinco jefes de Estado y de gobierno, así como 250 veteranos de la Segunda Guerra Mundial asistieron a las conmemoraciones. Entre ellos, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden; el rey Carlos III, y el primer ministro canadiense, Justin Trudeau .\nEl presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron y su esposa Brigitte Macron, llegan con el presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, y su esposa, la primera dama de Estados Unidos, Jill Biden, a la ceremonia conmemorativa internacional en Omaha Beach para conmemorar el 80º aniversario del \"Día D\" de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.

    "title": "The Easy-To-Make Mistake To Avoid When Feeding The Hummingbirds In Your Yard",
    "text": "Feeding hummingbirds is a great way to bring nature closer to your home. You get a front-row seat to watch these tiny creatures up close. Luckily, it's easy to make homemade hummingbird nectar to fill your bird feeders: a simple recipe of one part white cane sugar to four parts water. This blend is actually quite similar to the sweet liquid found in flowers. However, many people tend to make a common mistake when making their own nectar — they use tap water.\nDepending on your living situation, your tap water may not be safe to mix into your homemade nectar. For instance, if you have a water softener that adds salt to your water, you can't use tap water because it will also add salt to your hummingbird food. It may also contain chemicals that can have detrimental effects on the health of the hummingbirds you are trying to attract and nurture. Finding safer alternatives is key to keeping your little visitors healthy and happy.\nThe hidden dangers of tap water\nNew Africa/Shutterstock Tap water has additives, such as chlorine and chloramine, in it to make it safe for people to drink. Many public water systems rely on chlorine as their main disinfectant. Some experts say trace amounts of chlorine in water is no more harmful than what's in rainwater and won't bother hummingbirds. Others argue that even a small amount could upset the birds' digestion. If chlorine gets mixed into the sugar water and the birds keep drinking it, this could add up in their system over time and lead to health problems.\nIf you've got a water softener at home, that's another thing to think about. These softeners use salt to get rid of the minerals in hard water, which ends up leaving behind sodium ions in the softened water. This can be a downside to owning a water softener as small birds like hummingbirds can't handle much sodium at all. Even a tiny bit can make them dehydrated and possibly hurt their kidneys. Their bodies just aren't built to handle all that extra salt content. So, it's good to know what's in your tap water before using it to make sugar water for those little hummers.\nChoosing the right water for your feeder\nMarpin.alp/Shutterstock Given the potential dangers of tap water, it's important to select the right type of water for your hummingbird feeder. It's best to go for bottled spring water. Bottled spring water has helpful minerals for hummingbirds without any of the harmful chemicals found in tap water. Bottled purified water works well, too, as it is essentially free of all chemicals. Both choices are suitable, but make sure the brand you buy doesn't have any flavors, vitamins, or minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These additives can change the nectar's chemistry.\nIf you can't get your hands on a bottle of spring or purified water, you can use filtered tap water instead. Choose a kitchen water filter that can remove chemicals, heavy metals, and other impurities from the tap water. Go for one that targets chlorine, since that's the most common additive in public water supply. Once you have the right type of water for your feeder, you can go ahead and mix it with your white sugar. Then, you're all set for some happy birdwatching.",
