    "text": "La temperatura media en China en julio fue la más alta registrada en dicho mes desde 1961, según el Centro Meteorológico Nacional. Durante el séptimo mes del año, la temperatura media en el país asiático alcanzó los 23,2 grados, 1,1 grados más alta que la temperatura en años considerados normales, informó este jueves el subdirector de la institución, Jia Xialong, citado hoy por el diario China Daily. \"En julio, China se enfrentó a una combinación de lluvias extremas y temperaturas extremadamente altas en todo el país\", señaló Jia en un evento en Pekín. El sur de China sufrió una ola de calor generalizada y prolongada, con múltiples regiones experimentando altas temperaturas continuas durante más de 20 días. Un total de 59 estaciones meteorológicas nacionales registraron temperaturas máximas diarias que rompieron o igualaron récords históricos. Los récords de calor se rompieron en todo el mundo el mes pasado, siendo el 22 de julio el día más caluroso registrado en la Tierra, con una temperatura media diaria global de 17,15°C. El aumento repentino de la temperatura media diaria del 21 al 22 de julio se debió principalmente a temperaturas significativamente más altas de lo normal en el hemisferio norte, particularmente en América del Norte y Europa, así como en la mayor parte de la Antártida, explicó el experto. Según las previsiones del Centro, las temperaturas en la mayor parte de China seguirán siendo más altas de lo habitual en agosto: se esperan dos olas de calor significativas en la primera mitad de agosto, y se prevé que las altas temperaturas disminuyan a finales de mes. En julio, fuertes precipitaciones dejaron más de una treintena de fallecidos y cientos de miles de damnificados en el centro de China. En los últimos veranos, los eventos climáticos extremos han causado estragos en el gigante asiático: los meses estivales de 2023 estuvieron marcados por las citadas inundaciones en Pekín, mientras que, en 2022, diversas olas de calor extremo y sequías azotaron el centro y el este del país. En julio de 2021, precipitaciones de una intensidad inédita en décadas dejaron casi 400 muertos en la provincia central de Henan, que el Ejecutivo chino achacó a una \"falta de preparación y de percepción de riesgo\" por parte de las autoridades locales .

    "text": "Third-party presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has filed paperwork to have his name withdrawn from the Arizona ballot, the secretary of state’s office has confirmed to Scripps News. This comes just a day before Kennedy is scheduled to address the nation about what his campaign called a \"present historical moment and his path forward.\" RELATED STORY | [RFK Jr. to speak Friday amid speculation he'll drop independent presidential bid and support Trump](https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-to-speak-friday-amid-speculation-hell-drop-independent-presidential-bid-and-support-trump) There is growing speculation that he could announce he's dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and throwing his support behind Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Kennedy running mate Nicole Shanahan said in a podcast interview on [\"Impact Theory\"](https://impacttheory.com/#podcasts) that Kennedy was looking for the most effective way of preventing Vice President Kamala Harris from winning in November. Shanahan went on to propose two potential scenarios for moving forward, one of which would be for Kennedy to end his campaign and endorse Trump. RELATED STORY | [Judge rules against RFK Jr. in fight to be on New York’s ballot](https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/judge-rules-against-rfk-jr-in-fight-to-be-on-new-yorks-ballot) According to an average of polls from the [website 538,](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) Kennedy had his polling numbers drop after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. He now is averaging 4.9% in national polls, behind Harris who is at 46.7% and Trump who is at 43.8%. No independent candidate has won any Electoral College votes since 1968.",

    "text": "The Alpharetta City Council recently approved a $159,953 contract with Kompan for the construction of a playground at Mid-Broadwell City Park, 1480 Mid Broadwell Road.\nPlanning for the park began in 2016 when the city purchased land for future development. In 2019 young members of the community presented a vision of a playground with a natural play area complete with a water table for kids to enjoy.\nDuring the design phase it was determined that the development of the park would be completed in phases. Phase 1 of the project built the restrooms. When funding became available, phase 2 with the parking area was completed, and phase 3 is the development of the playground and trail.\nThe approved playground design will have a standalone water play table and components for ages 2-5 and 5-12 with a tree house look, swings, a toddler swing and inclusive play area, and signage designating appropriate ages for play space and general playground rules.\nThe city hopes to have the new playground open by the end of March.\nAbout the Author\nKaren Huppertz for the AJC",

A new RS6 is in development, but it will be electric.\nThe UK publication claims the V6 will produce identical power in both models, and differentiation will instead come from different electric motor outputs.\nCiting unnamed internal sources, it claims the RS5 will develop \"around\" 600 horsepower (447kW), while the RS7 will reportedly develop \"around\" 725 horsepower (541kW) – both with a 'Boost' mode unlocking 50 horsepower (37kW) in short bursts.\nMORE: 2024 Audi RS6 GT unveiled as likely last of the non-hybrid V8s, coming to Australia\n+ 8 Photos Audi RS4 V6 engine.
