    "title": "Türkiye expected to reach sustainable growth by 2026: OECD economist - Türkiye Today",
    "text": "If Türkiye maintains its current monetary policies and enhances foreign investor confidence, it is expected to return to sustainable growth levels by 2026, according to an economist at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\nSebastien Turban, one of the authors of the OECD’s Türkiye economic survey released on April 10, told Turkish news agency Anadolu that the country’s current account deficit has narrowed, while inflation and inflation expectations have declined since the shift in macroeconomic policy in mid-2023.\nTurban acknowledged that inflation remains high but is on a downward trajectory, emphasizing that both fiscal and monetary tightening must continue until inflation is under control.\n“If the government achieves its medium-term program objectives and maintains this level of deficit in the long run, public debt and finances will be sustainable,” Turban said.\nPeople stand next to a currency exchange board showing the Turkish Lira which fell to historic lows against the dollar, a day after the arrest of Istanbul’s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul, Türkiye, on Mar. 20, 2025. (AFP Photo) Risk of premature relaxation He also noted that Türkiye’s Central Bank and fiscal institutions have committed to preserving the current stance.\n“Looking at Central Bank communication, they are really clear that the monetary policy stance should remain tight until inflation is under control, and decisions on interest rates will be determined by the trajectory of inflation and expectations,” he added.\n“We see a risk of premature relaxation, but it is a risk. The baseline for us is that we observe there is a strong commitment to those policies, and we see premature relaxation as a risk out of the baseline,” Turban said.\nHe further explained that macroeconomic reforms in the past two years have strengthened Türkiye’s external position and gross reserves, with net reserves excluding swaps turning positive for the first time since early 2020.\n“However, the reduction so far has been observable but still significantly lower than the buildup that has occurred in the past two years,” Turban said. “We still see the increase in reserves as a really positive thing, and it has been critical.”\nFile photo shows an individual shopping in a grocery shop in Türkiye, accessed on Dec. 3, 2024. (AA Photo) ‘Unsustainably high’ growth in 2023 Before mid-2023, Turban noted that Türkiye’s growth was “unsustainably high,” but tighter policies have made it more stable.\nThe OECD expects Türkiye’s economy to grow 3.1 percent this year, partly due to continued monetary and fiscal tightening, which will create downward pressure on both inflation and growth.\n“The potential growth of the Turkish economy right now for the OECD is assessed at around 4%. Potential growth is how much the economy can grow without putting too much inflationary pressure,” Turban said. “Our current projections show that in 2026, growth in Türkiye will return to this potential level—at this level, there’s no upward pressure on inflation.”\nHe emphasized that foreign direct investment and investor perceptions have improved due to macroeconomic measures, with credit rating upgrades contributing to growing international optimism.\n“It is important to ensure that those investments are not volatile capital flows but more stable foreign direct investment,” he said. “This is part of the reason why we advocate for the policy stance to be maintained. Investor confidence can be built up.”\n“Right now, what we have seen with communications from the Central Bank and fiscal authorities and from the decisions that have been taken in response to the current uncertainties, the commitment is there, and confidence in Türkiye is building up,” Turban concluded.\nHe stressed the importance of continuing this path to ensure that investor confidence continues to improve and that foreign investment flows become more permanent.",

Baidu describes it as the largest online community in the world due to its vast number of users.\nAn account in Tieba called City Data posted data on Wednesday that said 7.88 million babies were born in 2023, which was a stunning 1.68 million less than 2022’s total.

    "title": "Deepfake attacks seen as top cyber threat in Australia",
    "text": "AI-generated deepfake attacks have been identified as the primary security risk for IT professionals in Australia, according to GetApp's Annual Data Security Report. The report underscores a significant concern over the potential for AI-enhanced cyberattacks, with 55% of surveyed IT professionals indicating that deepfake attacks are their chief threat for the current year and looking forward to 2025. In response to this threat, 66% of Australian companies have now developed response plans.\nGetApp conducted this research by surveying 4,000 IT professionals across 11 countries, with 500 respondents from Australia. The survey also highlighted ongoing issues with other cyber threats, such as email phishing and ransomware.\nPhishing remains a predominant concern. The report reveals that 92% of Australian IT professionals experienced phishing emails over the past year, with 86% encountering colleagues who had clicked on malicious links. Phishing and ransomware attacks are projected to remain pressing issues in 2025, seen as the top threats by 32% and 30% of IT professionals, respectively.\nRansomware incidents particularly affected Australian businesses in 2024, with 64% reporting attacks aimed at extorting and stealing data. Of those targeted by ransomware, 60% paid the demanded ransom, while only 24% managed to recover their data independently. Sadly, 28% suffered permanent data loss.\nData breach statistics in Australia are concerning, with occurrences higher than the global average. Seventy-two percent of IT professionals in Australia reported one or more data breaches within the past year, compared to a global average of 61%. The prevalent causes include software vulnerabilities (50%), malware (47%), and social engineering tactics (38%). Moreover, 37% of breaches were attributed to non-malicious errors like system misconfigurations.\nThe importance of regular system checks is emphasized to prevent potential breaches. Reassessing data security measures emerges as a priority for 51% of Australian respondents, especially in light of evolving AI threats.\nSecurity awareness efforts are evident, with 75% of Australian workers participating in simulated phishing attacks—this figure surpasses the global average of 70%. Such exercises are designed to strengthen email security by raising awareness of social engineering tactics and identifying areas requiring further training.\nAndrew Blair, Content Analyst at GetApp, commented on the findings: \"IT professionals need to remain vigilant against a new incoming wave of AI-generated deepfake attacks and ensure they have the right protocols and procedures in place for them if they haven't done so already.\"\nHe added, \"Additionally, IT professionals will also need to improve basic cybersecurity efforts in 2025 to curb the amount of data breaches as regulations begin to tighten.\"\nThe report sheds light on the evolving landscape of cyber threats and the need for robust security measures to protect against them in the coming years.",

    "text": "Deshielo de nieve y hasta protectores solares, son fuentes de contaminación en playas: Protección Ambiental de EU\nUna playa contaminada es un riesgo para la salud, asegura la EPA.\nUna playa contaminada es un riesgo para la salud, así lo determina la Agencia de Protección Ambiental de los Estados Unidos (EPA por sus siglas en inglés), al tiempo que señala qué factores que las dañan.\nLa EPA señala que una playa contaminada \"representa un riesgo para la salud pública, puede reducir el valor de las propiedades e inhibir el crecimiento económico de la comunidad\".\n-\nTe recomendamos\nPor bacterias, piden no nadar en 3 playas de Corpus Christi en TexasInternacional\nDesde desbordamientos por lluivas hasta embarcaciones: Esto afecta la salud de playas\nLos desbordamientos provocados por la lluvia o el deshielo de la nieve, la escorrentía de patios, campos y superficies pavimentadas, las descargas de buques y embarcaciones, la basura, el protector solar y las floraciones de algas nocivas son las fuentes de contaminación de las playas.\nComo factor inicial la EPA ubica los desbordamientos, que incluyen el alcantarillado combinado y el alcantarillado sanitario, provocados por causas como las obstrucciones, roturas de tuberías, defectos en el alcantarillado que sobrecargan el sistema, fallas en la operación y mantenimiento, cortes de electricidad, diseño inadecuado y vandalismo.\n\"El agua de lluvia o deshielo puede provocar el desbordamiento de ciertos tipos de alcantarillado si se excede su capacidad\".\nEn su estudio '¿Qué afecta la salud de las playas?', la EPA explicó que aguas residuales sin tratar, industriales y pluviales, afectan estas zonas.\n\"Las descargas de los desbordamientos de alcantarillado combinado (CSO) y de alcantarillado sanitario (SSO) contienen una mezcla de aguas residuales sin tratar, aguas residuales industriales y aguas pluviales, y han provocado el cierre de playas, el cierre de criaderos de mariscos y problemas estéticos\".\nEn el cual agrega como fuente de contaminación la escorrentía de patios, campos y superficies pavimentadas, misma que su nivel de riesgo es alto debido a que \"funciona\" como un recogedor de contaminantes de toda naturaleza que terminan por caer en los cuerpos de agua, ya sea el océano su destino final o los lagos, ríos y arroyos.\n\"Cuando la lluvia o el agua derretida fluyen sobre la tierra o superficies impermeables como calles pavimentadas, estacionamientos y tejados de edificios, recogen contaminantes, estas sustancias pueden incluir excrementos de mascotas y animales cargados de bacterias, fertilizantes, pesticidas, productos químicos, gasolina, aceite de motor, anticongelante y tierra/sedimentos\".\n\"El agua contaminada fluye hacia desagües pluviales, ríos, lagos, arroyos y el océano\", explicó la Agencia.\nAsimismo, la EPA menciona las descargas de buques y embarcaciones dentro del paquete de fuentes de contaminación de las playas, producto de la basura que producen y el agua que dañan, por lo cual existen ciertos reglamento, leyes y permisos para regular su operación.\n\"Los vertidos accidentales o intencionales de todo tipo de embarcaciones son una fuente de contaminación que puede afectar nuestras playas, estos vertidos incluyen basura, aparejos de pesca, agua de lastre, agua de sentina y agua de lavabos y duchas\".\n\"La forma en que la EPA controla estos vertidos depende del tipo de embarcación: las embarcaciones recreativas como canoas, kayaks, lanchas motoras, yates y veleros están amparadas por la Ley de Navegación Limpia , y las embarcaciones comerciales, incluidas las utilizadas para transportar clientes, están amparadas por el Permiso General para Embarcaciones del programa de permisos del Sistema Nacional de Eliminación de Descargas Contaminantes y las regulaciones de agua de lastre de la Guardia Costera\".\n-\nTe recomendamos\nTexas es quinto lugar en longitud de playas en Estados UnidosInternacional\nSobre la problemática de la basura la Agencia de Protección Ambiental del vecino país del norte, subraya la importancia del reciclaje y un manejo adecuado de los desechos para evitar contaminar las playas.\n\"Toda basura que no se recicla ni se desecha adecuadamente puede llegar a nuestras playas al ser arrastrada por la lluvia a desagües pluviales, arroyos y ríos, y luego fluir hacia bahías y estuarios hasta el océano, donde se deposita en la playa\".\n\"Esto incluye bolsas de plástico, botellas, latas, filtros de cigarrillos, tapones y tapas de botellas, otras fuentes incluyen la gente que deja su basura en la playa y los pescadores que pierden o desechan redes y sedales en el océano\".\nEn cuanto a los productos químicos para protegerse de los efectos nocivos de la luz ultravioleta, comentó la EPA, son una amenaza a los corales y otras formas de vida marina como peces, delfines y mejillones.\nFinalmente, detalló que las floraciones de algas nocivas (FAN) se producen cuando las algas crecen descontroladamente y producen efectos tóxicos o perjudiciales para las personas, los peces, los mariscos, los mamíferos marinos y las aves.\n.\n- Queda prohibida la

Ele também nomeou um substituto: o reverendo Pierre Charland, de 62 anos, atualmente um dos principais membros da ordem franciscana católica romana do Canadá.\nEm um comunicado, o papa mencionou que qualquer bispo que completa 75 anos é automaticamente solicitado a oferecer a sua renúncia. O papa toma a decisão de aceitar ou não a oferta \"após analisar todas as circunstâncias\", segundo o comunicado.\nBlais é mencionado em uma lista de predadores sexuais registrada como parte de uma ação coletiva das vítimas contra a Arquidiocese de Quebec. Ele negou qualquer irregularidade.\n\"A indicação de um novo bispo... não está ligada às acusações contra o bispo Blais\", disse a Diocese de Baie-Comeau em um comunicado por email, mencionando a política da igreja de exigir que todos que completam 75 anos ofereçam suas renúncias.\nBlais não falará com a imprensa, acrescentou.",

    "title": "SmartRecruiters Unveils Winston: AI That Keeps Hiring Human",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, SmartRecruiters proudly unveils Winston, the AI-powered recruiting companion that is set to disrupt the recruitment technology space. Winston doesn't just reduce administrative tasks - he eliminates them entirely. From screening candidates and scheduling interviews to sending follow-up notes, Winston frees hiring teams to focus on the most human part of the process - the interview. This launch marks a bold step forward in SmartRecruiters' vision of \"SmartRecruiters 3.0\", signaling the end of the traditional ATS and the beginning of an AI-driven era where hiring teams can achieve superhuman results.\nAt the heart of this transformation is Winston - a charismatic AI companion who is both the face and the intelligence behind SmartRecruiters' AI-driven platform. With his cheerful personality and advanced capabilities, Winston, the familiar face of SmartRecruiters, makes the complex world of hiring more accessible, enjoyable, and, above all, smarter. Imagine a system that molds itself to your needs - where every interaction is intuitive, interfaces adapt in real-time, and insights are surfaced before you even realize you need them. That's the future with Winston.\nRebecca Carr, CEO of SmartRecruiters, shared her thoughts on Winston's revolutionary impact. \"The traditional ATS isn't meeting the expectations of hiring managers and recruiters. It's no longer serving the demands of modern hiring - especially in high-volume, high-turnover industries, such as retail and manufacturing. We needed something more adaptive, more human, and that's Winston. He's not just a feature; he's the future of recruitment technology, designed to remove the manual, administrative burden from hiring teams, giving them back the time to focus on the heart of hiring: connecting with great talent.\"\nWinston: Elevating Recruitment Efficiency\nIn a market crowded with half-baked AI tools that only address limited aspects of the hiring process, Winston stands apart by being a truly comprehensive, AI-driven solution built on the foundational strength of SmartRecruiters' ATS workflow and data model. From intelligent scheduling to real-time agentic insights to an adaptive ui that evolves based on user behavior and context, Winston enables teams to run leaner, faster, and more effectively than ever before. He doesn't just assist; he eliminates the most time-consuming, low-value tasks and constantly optimizes the hiring process to ensure maximum efficiency. While high-volume, high-turnover hiring is Winston's initial core focus, long-term plans call for continued feature development, unlocking possibilities across a wide range of additional industries and hiring scenarios\nPowering the New SmartRecruiters Platform\nAs the driving force behind SmartRecruiters 3.0, Winston redefines how recruitment technology serves businesses. By pushing the boundaries of what talent acquisition software can do, SmartRecruiters is creating a smarter, more intuitive platform that adapts to the evolving needs of hiring teams. Winston will power SmartRecruiters at every touchpoint, transforming traditionally cumbersome recruitment processes into seamless, even joyful, experiences for both recruiters and candidates.\nShiran Yaroslavsky, SVP of Product at SmartRecruiters, reinforced this vision: \"Winston represents a seismic shift in recruitment technology. We're not just automating tasks; we're eliminating the inefficiencies that have plagued this industry for decades. Winston is at the heart of this new SmartRecruiters chapter - he adapts, learns, and drives smarter, faster decisions across the board. And we're just getting started. Our goal is nothing short of transforming how the world hires.\"\nProduct Availability and Key Capabilities\nThe initial wave of Winston's capabilities is designed to tackle some of the biggest pain points hiring teams face.

    "text": "You can trust VideoGamer . Our team of gaming experts spend hours testing and reviewing the latest games, to ensure you're reading the most comprehensive guide possible. Rest assured, all imagery and advice is unique and original. Check out how we test and review games here\nGSC Game World has released Stalker 2 to mixed reviews with some glowing praise and high disdain. While we were very positive in our review of the jank-filled survival game, others have not taken kindly to the long-awaited sequel in this post-apocalypse world.\nAlongside the broken A-Life system that is currently in the midst of being fixed, a number of players have taken issue with the game’s weapon durability system . Designed to make The Zone even more depressing and brutal, players upset with the mechanic are already removing it.\nStalker 2 players scrap weapon durability At the time of writing, multiple mods have already been released to remove weapon durability entirely or make it less impactful. For example, the new “ No Weapon Durability Loss ” mod completely removes the mechanic, making every gun a functional firearm. The mod also allows you to remove all durability effects from outfits as well.\nThis mod has been downloaded over 7,000 times at the time of publication with many players praising the modder for allowing them to actually use the majority of weapons they find. However, this is far from the only mod that alters this mechanic.\nAnother mod, “ Reasonable Weapon Degradation ”, has also been downloaded over 7,000 times. With this mod, weapon durability decreases half as fast as the base game, but players still have to maintain their weapons.\nAs someone who reviewed Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the game’s weapon durability is, by far, its best combat mechanic. After a long stretch in The Zone, the possibility of your gun jamming as you take that all-important headshot is thrilling, but it’s also easy to see how players would be annoyed at it.\nIn a more reasonable modding scenario, one player has created a mod that makes the game’s mutant Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists “ less tanky ”. As the worst element of the game—outside of some of the more egregious bugs—this is a change that’s very welcome.\nFor more Stalker 2 coverage, check out some our handy guides, like how long it takes to cross the entire map or how to find the Drowned Weapon in The Zone.\nAbout the Author Lewis White\nLewis White is a veteran games journalist with a decade of experience writing news, reviews, features and investigative pieces about game development with a focus on Halo and Xbox.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl Platform(s): PC, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series S/X, Xbox Series X Genre(s): Action, Adventure, RPG, Shooter, Survival Horror Subscribe to our newsletters!

    "text": "Russian celebrities and socialites have been forced to make grovelling public apologies after their “almost naked” Christmas party fell foul of Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on decadence and gay rights .\nThe television stars and singers have lost lucrative film and concert appearance bookings since they were filmed partying in the run-up to Christmas in lingerie and drag.\nTheir party at a Moscow nightclub triggered outrage among conservatives and traditionalists, who have become increasingly influential in Putin’s Russia .\nOfficials have also now closed the party venue and opened an investigation into the party organiser Anastasia Ivleeva, a 32-year-old Instagram star, for suspected tax evasion of 130 million roubles (£1.1 million).\n“They say that Russia knows how to forgive. If this is true, I would really like to ask you, the people, for a second chance,” Ms Ivleeva said in a teary video.\nPutin has made promoting traditional Slavic family values and banning gay rights central to his presidency, and prosecutors are considering charging Ms Ivleeva with “promoting homosexuality”. She is also suspected of posting social media comments against the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine .\nPublic anger is focused on the decadence of the party, which countered the Kremlin’s insistence on buttoned-up austerity in Russia to support its war in Ukraine.\nThe party-goers had photographed themselves wearing mesh tops, lingerie and BDSM-style props. ‘Gay propaganda’\nOne Russian celebrity rapper whose stage name is Vicio arrived wearing only a sock over his penis. He was subsequently jailed for 15 days on charges of petty hooliganism and fined 200,000 roubles (£1,700) for “gay propaganda”.\nOn one of his nightly talk shows on Russian TV, the Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov described the socialites who attended the party as “traitors” who party “while our guys on the frontline are dying”.\nFor ordinary Russians who have seen their living standards drop because of the war in Ukraine and thousands of men mobilised to the frontline, the socialites’ “almost naked” party was proof that the Moscow elite have been sheltered from the worst impacts of the war.\nMany of the comments under Ms Ivleeva’s video apology on the Telegram social messaging site called on her to head down to occupied Donbas in Ukraine to entertain Russian soldiers.\nEkaterina Mizulina, the pro-war Kremlin pin-up of aspirational middle-class Russia, called for a boycott against celebrities who were at the party.\n“Our soldiers at the front definitely aren’t fighting for this,” she said. “These raves are like firing a bullet into the foot of an entire policy implemented by the state.” ‘Satanic party’\nRamzan Kadyrov , Chechnya’s staunchly pro-war leader, suggested that people who attended the “satanic” party should be sent to the Russian special forces school in Chechnya to help train soldiers to fight in Ukraine.\n“There is nothing wrong with helping to organise their training, in the dining room, in the laundry room, in the first aid post,” he said.\nCelebrities photographed at the party included the pop singers Dima Bilan and Filip Kirkorov, and the journalist Ksenia Sobchak .\nA video on Telegram showed Mr Bilan, winner of the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest, explaining to Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, that despite going to the party, he fully supported Putin’s war in Ukraine.\n“I understand perfectly well the resentment of our people, and especially our guys who are defending us on the frontlines,” Mr Bilan later said.\nBut Baza, a Telegram channel linked to Russia’s FSB security forces , said that all celebrities photographed at the party were likely to face “big problems” after Putin was told that the videos had upset Russian soldiers.\n“It is not known to Baza which soldiers were indignant but the video and photos eventually reached Vladimir Putin and the president didn’t like what he saw,” it said, quoting unnamed sources.\nSince he invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Putin has reoriented Russia’s economy and society towards supporting his war. Police have raided nightclub s this year suspected of being soft on the war in Ukraine. Millions of Russians have fled abroad as restrictions have tightened and protests are banned.\nPutin is facing a presidential election in March and although he will use the state machinery to easily win the election, he still wants to be supported by ordinary Russians.\nThe post Russian celebrities forced to make public apologies after ‘almost naked’ party appeared first on The Telegraph .",
