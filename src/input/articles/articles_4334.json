    "text": "Los incendios forestales en Nuevo León han provocado una serie de emergencias en diversas zonas del estado, generando preocupación entre la población y autoridades, uno de los incidentes más impactantes quedó registrado en un video difundido en redes sociales, donde se observa cómo un siniestro obliga a los pasajeros de un camión de transporte público a descender apresuradamente para resguardar su seguridad.\nEn las imágenes se aprecia cómo el autobús avanza lentamente mientras el fuego se extiende cerca de la carretera, repentinamente, el camión se detiene en un punto crítico, quedando rodeado de humo y llamas, los pasajeros, alarmados por la proximidad del fuego, comienzan a gritarle al conductor para que continúe su marcha.\nSin embargo, al notar que el riesgo aumenta, deciden bajarse de la unidad, en medio de la confusión, se escuchan gritos y el llanto de niños aterrados por la situación. “Bájate, bájate, quítese, señor”, exclama desesperada una mujer mientras desciende del camión, al tocar el suelo, los pasajeros corren en distintas direcciones en busca de un lugar seguro. Hasta el momento, no se han reportado heridos por este incidente.\nLa situación ha provocado una fuerte reacción en redes sociales, donde habitantes de la zona metropolitana de Monterrey han compartido imágenes del cielo cubierto de humo y han expresado su preocupación por la mala calidad del aire derivada de los incendios recientes, las autoridades estatales han informado que los efectos del frente frío número 31 han ocasionado fuertes vientos de hasta 70 kilómetros por hora, lo que ha complicado las labores para controlar el fuego y ha contribuido a su rápida propagación.\n¿Por qué hubo incendios en Nuevo León?\nUno de los incendios más graves se registró en el municipio de Santa Catarina, en los límites con García, Nuevo León, a un costado de la carretera a García, el fuego inició en una zona baldía y, pese a la intervención inmediata de rescatistas y cuerpos de emergencia, los vientos intensos hicieron que las llamas se extendieron sin control.\nAnte la magnitud del siniestro, elementos de Protección Civil estatal y de los municipios afectados se sumaron a las labores de combate al fuego, contando con el apoyo de pipas de empresas privadas y de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey.\nLas llamas causaron afectaciones en al menos cuatro empresas cercanas al área del incendio, obligando a las autoridades a desalojar de manera preventiva a 80 empleados, aunque se estima que la cifra podría aumentar, entre las instalaciones afectadas se encuentran un corralón, la empresa ADS, patios industriales y una fábrica de tarimas.\nComo medida preventiva, las autoridades han cerrado la carretera a García desde la vía libre Monterrey-Saltillo hasta el Libramiento y Luis Donaldo Colosio. Además, debido a la acumulación de contaminantes en el aire, se ha declarado una contingencia ambiental en la zona metropolitana de Monterrey.\nLA",

    "text": "The Fascinating World of Nuclear Aircraft Carriers: A Deep Dive into Refueling Nuclear aircraft carriers, the behemoths of the sea, are marvels of engineering. These floating fortresses boast immense power and endurance, thanks to their nuclear reactors. But how often do these powerful vessels need to refuel? The answer might surprise you. Unlike conventional aircraft carriers that rely on fossil fuels, nuclear carriers operate for decades without needing to be refueled with traditional fuels. This remarkable feat is achieved through the use of nuclear reactors, which generate energy through a process called nuclear fission. The Power of Nuclear Fission Nuclear fission is a process where the nucleus of an atom is split, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. In a nuclear reactor, this energy is harnessed to produce heat, which is then used to generate steam and drive turbines, ultimately producing electricity. The electricity powers the ship’s systems, including the propulsion system, weapons systems, and life support systems. A Look at the Fuel Cycle The nuclear fuel used in these reactors is highly enriched uranium, a radioactive material. This fuel is carefully contained within the reactor core, where it undergoes fission. The process of fission produces radioactive byproducts, which are contained within the reactor core and eventually removed as spent fuel. Refueling: A Complex and Carefully Planned Process While nuclear aircraft carriers don’t require frequent refueling with traditional fuels, they do require periodic refueling of their nuclear reactors. This process is complex and meticulously planned, involving the removal and replacement of spent fuel. The refueling process usually takes several months and is carried out in a specialized dry dock. The Lifespan of a Nuclear Aircraft Carrier The lifespan of a nuclear aircraft carrier is significantly longer than that of a conventional carrier. The nuclear reactor is designed to last for the entire service life of the ship, which is typically around 50 years. This means that a nuclear carrier can operate for decades without needing to be refueled with traditional fuels, making them highly efficient and cost-effective in the long run. The Benefits of Nuclear Power The use of nuclear power in aircraft carriers offers several advantages: - Long Endurance: Nuclear carriers can operate for extended periods without needing to be refueled, making them ideal for long-duration missions. - Increased Power: Nuclear reactors provide a significant power output, allowing for the operation of advanced weapons systems and other demanding equipment. - Reduced Emissions: Nuclear carriers produce virtually no greenhouse gas emissions, making them a more environmentally friendly option. Conclusion Nuclear aircraft carriers are a testament to human ingenuity and technological advancement. Their ability to operate for decades without refueling with traditional fuels makes them formidable assets in the modern military landscape. The use of nuclear power offers significant advantages in terms of endurance, power, and environmental impact, solidifying the role of these vessels as crucial components of global naval power.",

    "title": "Well-known Texas pastor Terry Turner reflects on ministry, legacy as he enters retirement | Baptist Press",
    "text": "MESQUITE, Texas (BP) – Terry Turner stepped down from the pulpit of the church he founded, Mesquite Friendship Baptist, in the fall of 2023. His formal retirement, however, simply signaled a change of vocation, not a cessation of labor. Turner’s remarkable four-plus decades of ministry began in Guthrie, Okla., where he was born in 1957, the eighth child of Julia, then age 47, and Roosevelt Turner, 49. “They weren’t looking to have more kids,” Turner said. “God wanted me here even before I was born to give me parents who were almost senior citizens. I was the product of love.” Ten years before Turner was born, Roosevelt’s vocal chords were removed in a laryngectomy. “I never heard his voice,” Turner said, adding that his father supported the family by running a juke joint by night and working as a handyman and scrap metal dealer by day until his death in 1967. His mom worked as a maid until her right leg was amputated only a few days before his dad passed. The family survived on one Social Security check and “commodity goods” – a monthly government food distribution. Spiritually rich “We didn’t have a lot of resources, but I didn’t know I was poor,” Turner said. Church was a constant. Turner remembers his mother waking him every Sunday morning, tearfully singing to gospel music playing on the radio in the background. “I can’t remember a Sunday morning that she didn’t praise the Lord amidst her pain,” he said. “She was a strong lady.” At 15, he felt the Lord leading him to preach. Turner responded by telling the Lord he wanted to be a preacher who would always be true to His Word, but asked if he could wait until he was grown to heed the call. “That turned out to be a bad decision,” Turner said, admitting that as a teen he rebelled and became involved in the pervasive drug culture around him. But God was persistent. By age 18, Turner said he was a “broken young man.” Isaiah Burleigh, his pastor at the time, influenced Turner’s turnaround. At age 21, Turner finally accepted God’s call on his life to preach. Proximity to his mom determined his college selection, as he headed to Langston University, 11 miles from Guthrie, after high school. “I wanted to stay close to Mom and be sure she was OK,” he said. “Everyone had grown up and moved out. It was just the two of us for years.” There was another woman in his life, however: Nancy Chandler. They dated as teens, went their separate ways, and reunited after both graduated from college. “She was my childhood love; now she is my senior citizen love,” Turner said of Nancy. They married in 1982, the same year Turner accepted the call to pastor a Baptist church in Guthrie located directly across the street from the home in which he had been born. The church had been through several pastors, Turner recalled, but he accepted the invitation to assist Pastor Henry Carter, then terminally ill. After Carter passed away, Turner was asked to become the church’s full-time pastor. “If you can learn to pastor us, you can pastor anybody anywhere,” members told him. “There was a lot of truth to that,” Turner said, adding that the congregation “taught me church polity like nobody else.” God blessed Turner’s seven years at the church, and the pastor who succeeded him is still there. New city, new church By the late ‘80s, the Turners had four children as a blended family: daughter Angela and sons Tim, Caleb, and Levi. God was blessing their ministry at their church in Oklahoma. Turner had also been asked to teach Bible classes in Dallas and Oklahoma City. T.D. Callender, the founder of the Oklahoma City Bible school where Turner was teaching, recommended he attend Dallas Theological Seminary. The Turners followed the advice, arriving in the Metroplex on Dec. 31, 1988. “We were broke in Texas,” Turner said. Moving expenses claimed their last $500, and nearly penniless, the family rented a home in Duncanville. When the landlord heard Turner was a seminary student, he asked what they could afford. “He never raised our rent,” Turner said. “We lived in that home through seminary.” Nancy soon found work as a banker, while Turner attended seminary classes and worked as a security guard. In 1991, after his graduation from seminary, Turner again sensed God’s direction to plant a church. Although his Oklahoma churches had not been Southern Baptist, he partnered with the Southern Baptist Convention. “The SBC had put an emphasis on planting African American churches to bring inclusiveness to the convention. [Mesquite Friendship] was on the ground floor of that in 1991. The rest is history,” Turner said. Mesquite Friendship was constituted as a Southern Baptist church on Jan. 27, 1994. “We’ve been SBC all these years. I’ve been blessed by being part of the Convention. They had programs and grants that would bless church planters if they were willing to do the work and do the reports. … We quickly outgrew our storefront and bought a building with SBC help. They paid my salary and helped with the note. [We] showed progress and they helped us for four years,” he said, adding that he was very pleased when the church could start giving through the Cooperative Program. From a core group of 16 members in 1991, Mesquite Friendship grew to 300 during its first three years. Just before the pandemic, Mesquite Friendship had 2,100 members and held two Sunday services averaging 700 apiece. Since COVID, membership numbers and giving have stayed steady or increased, though some have continued to attend online. “Terry Turner is one of the most significant contributors to the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention since its inception,” said Jim Richards, SBTC’s executive director emeritus. “Pastor Turner led Mesquite Friendship Baptist Church to affiliate and immediately began participation. His generosity through Cooperative Program giving showed his kingdom investment beyond the local church.” What’s next? Although no longer filling the pulpit weekly, Turner remains busy at Mesquite Friendship as its pastor emeritus, taking an active role in the comfort and support ministry. “When you have pastored people for so many years, you [want to be] there for them at the loss of their loved ones,” he said. He continues to provide premarital counseling to couples in the church and community. A recent appointee to the board of the Dallas Genealogical Society, Turner also researches the past and helps others to do the same. He has engaged in ancestry research for 11 years, the last three professionally, and said he has traced his paternal family lineage back to 1770 – [including his enslaved ancestors](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/african-american-history-illuminates-pastors-life/) and their slave owners. “Believe it or not, many of them were Southern Baptist,” Turner said, expressing amazement over this long connection to the SBC. His family’s history and spiritual heritage are the subjects of his latest book, When Grace Flows Backward, due for release in early 2024. Turner also launched a YouTube channel called “Embracing our Ancestors” to teach African Americans how to study their lineage. Through the years, Turner filled his time not only serving his church, but in a variety of roles with the SBTC and SBC. He served as the SBTC’s president from 2011-2013 and as president of the SBTC African American Fellowship from 2010-2016. Between continuing service to his church, his writing, and spending time with his 12 grandchildren, retirement promises to keep Turner plenty busy. “I’ve called it a promotion,” Turner said with a smile. “It’s a blessing to be able to retire [and], especially in ministry, to have served the Lord for 41 years.” TERRY TURNER’S CAREER HIGHLIGHTS - Led in planting nine Southern Baptist churches from Texas to Florida - Led Mesquite Friendship to support ministries and missionaries in Zambia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, and assisted in planting a church in Chandigarh, India - President of the Southern Baptists of Texas Bible Conference, 2011 - President of the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention, 2011-2014 - Spearheaded the SBTC’s cross-cultural, multiracial, multiethnic “Look Like Heaven” initiative - President of the SBTC African American Fellowship, 2010-2016 - Trustee, Gateway Baptist Theological Seminary - Trustee, Criswell College - Invited by Texas Gov.

    "text": "Representative Image New Delhi: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has officially confirmed that 2023 is the hottest year on record by a huge margin, smashing global temperature records. The yearly average global temperature approached 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is significant because the Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit the long-term temperature increase to no more than the same amount. According to the agreement, the long-term increase is calculated as an average over decades rather than an individual year like 2023. Global temperatures in every month between June and December set new monthly records, with July and August registering as the hottest months on record, the UN agency said in a statement. Strictly, the WMO found that the annual average global temperature was 1.45 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels. They consolidated six leading datasets used for monitoring global temperatures, all of which ranked 2023 as the warmest year on record. The datasets included those developed and maintained by space and meteorological agencies in the US - NASA and NOAA - along with those in the UK, Europe and Japan, before arriving at their conclusions regarding the year 2023. \"Climate change is the biggest challenge that humanity faces. It is affecting all of us, especially the most vulnerable,\" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo. \"We cannot afford to wait any longer. We are already taking action but we have to do more and we have to do it quickly. We have to make drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources.\" She said the temperature rise recorded globally reflected the mid-2023 shift from cooling effects brought about by the climate driver La Nina to the warming effects of El Nino. \"Given that El Nino usually has the biggest impact on global temperatures after it peaks, 2024 could be even hotter,\" said Saulo, who became WMO Secretary-General on January 1, 2024. \"While El Nino events are naturally occurring and come and go from one year to the next, longer-term climate change is escalating, and this is unequivocal because of human activities. \"The climate crisis is worsening the inequality crisis. It affects all aspects of sustainable development and undermines efforts to tackle poverty, hunger, ill-health, displacement, and environmental degradation,\" said Saulo. The WMO went on to say that since the 1980s, each decade had been getting progressively warmer, with the past nine years being the warmest on record, even as long-term monitoring of temperatures worldwide was just one indicator of climate and climatic changes. Other indicators include atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, ocean heat and acidification, sea level, sea ice extent and glacier mass balance, measures of all of which shattered existing records to make new ones, it said. The statement said that sea surface temperatures remained exceptionally high for much of the year, which were accompanied by severe and damaging marine heatwaves. Further, the sea ice extent in Antarctica registered its lowest measure ever, both for the end-of-summer minimum in February and end-of-winter maximum in September, the agency said. All these long-term climate changes expressed themselves in the daily weather, it said, with the extreme heat impacting health and fuelling devastating wildfires. Intense rainfall, floods, rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones left a trail of destruction, death and huge economic losses, it said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that 2023 was a \"mere preview of the catastrophic future\" that awaited us, if we didn't act now. \"Humanity's actions are scorching the earth. We must respond to record-breaking temperature rises with path-breaking action,\" he said. \"We can still avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But only if we act now with the ambition required to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius and deliver climate justice,\" he said. The WMO said it will issues its final State of the Global Climate 2023 report in March 2024, that will include details on socioeconomic impacts on food security, displacement, and health. In November 2023, the agency had issued a provisional report, showing that \"records were broken across the board\". PTI",
