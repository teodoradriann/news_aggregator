    "text": "A empresa americana Amazon , do bilionário Jeff Bezos , está se preparando para fazer o lançamento de seus primeiros satélites, com objetivo de fornecer internet a partir do espaço. Assim, a gigante da tecnologia desafiará a Starlink, de Elon Musk .\nA missão prevê o lançamento de 27 satélites por meio de um foguete Atlas V, do grupo United Launch Alliance (ULA), que inclui Boeing e Lockhead Martin. Além disso, a decolagem está prevista para o dia 9 de abril, a partir das 13h (de Brasília), com origem em Cabo Canaveral, na Flórida, nos Estados Unidos . A ULA já havia lançado dois protótipos para Amazon em 2023.\nOs satélites fazem parte do primeiro lote de uma rede de até 3.200 dispositivos em órbita baixa, que fornecerão internet de alta velocidade para áreas remotas do globo terrestre.\nMapa de satélites Starlink na Órbita Terrestre Baixa — Foto: Reprodução/Starlink Sattelite Tracker Segundo a empresa de comércio online, o serviço estará disponível até o final de 2025. A Amazon busca competir com a rede de satélites de Musk, que atualmente já conta com mais de 6.750 satélites em órbita, segundo o próprio site. Assim, segue como líder mundial no setor que se encontra em expansão.\nAlém da Starlink, a Amazon também deverá competir com a companhia europeia Eutelsat, a chinesa GuoWang e a canadense Telesat.",

    "title": "N.B. premier criticized for spilling news about upcoming visit by French president",
    "text": "New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs is facing heat from the Opposition after boasting that an upcoming visit to the province by the French president is due to the tourism minister's trip to France. Higgs's announcement in the legislature came after Liberal member Jean-Claude D'Amours criticized the $42,000 one-week trip last September to France and the United Kingdom by the tourism minister and three of her colleagues. The premier said the travel to Paris bore fruit because French President Emmanuel Macron is now scheduled to come to New Brunswick, an upcoming trip Higgs said is \"truly impressive.\" Liberal member Benoit Bourque later told reporters that Higgs's remarks were \"inappropriate\" and a \"breach of protocol.\" Bourque says announcements about foreign heads of state are made through the federal government and not \"blurted\" out on the floor of the legislature to defend a minister for taking an expensive trip abroad. The Opposition has said it was \"extravagant\" for Tourism Minister Tammy Scott-Wallace and three colleagues to travel to the United Kingdom and France Sept. 8-15, for visits to places such as Stonehenge and the Palace of Versailles. Scott-Wallace has said her trip led to the government securing contracts and to a rise in tourism. Bourque, however, said Macron's upcoming visit is not tourism-related, adding that Higgs's pronouncement in the legislature bordered on the \"scandalous.\" \"To insinuate that it had a lot to do with his minister of tourism, that the president would be going here is absolutely a stretch,\" he said. \"A one-time visit by the New Brunswick minister of tourism, I don't think it moved the needle at all. It was just a distraction by the premier to try to shift to something else, and to try to give her a bit of credit -- to his embattled minister.\" Later on Thursday, the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a news release confirming that Macron would visit New Brunswick this year \"to deepen the bilateral relationship\" between Canada and France and \"promote shared priorities.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6, 2024.

(CBS) -- Fenton Community High School District in Bensenville voted this week to bring on a third-party firm for an independent review of actions taken by the district after a former employee was accused of sexual misconduct.The district said it is initiating a request for proposal process, and will cast the net wide in soliciting proposals from vendors and firms.The district said the review will \"provide an objective and impartial assessment of the school district's handling of the current situation, and will include an unbiased evaluation of the adequacy of procedures, compliance with policies and regulations, and the appropriateness of disciplinary actions taken.\"Meanwhile, the district has partnered with the YWCA for trauma-based and small-group counseling in the wake of the allegations. The district has also partnered with Be Sure Counseling, a group of retired law enforcement officers who provide education to students, parents, and staff on child safety issues.At the center of the allegations spurring the review is an ex-staff member at Fenton High School accused of having inappropriate relationships with students dating back over a decade.Last month, police documents on the former staff member were leaked on social media, laying out sexual abuse allegations between a high school teacher and students. The staff member was first on administrative leave after the document was leaked, and has since been fired.In the wake of the allegations, a March 20 school board meeting became heated. Numerous parents and students spoke, including one young woman who said she was a survivor of abuse by the staff member.\"I pray that none of your daughters have not, and do not, suffer the karma from your atrocious in this predator's behavior,\" she told the board at the March 20 meeting.A timeline by School District Supt. James Ongtengco was later issued detailing all the tips they received involving the staffer – and how they were handled. The timeline revealed the accusations dated back to 2011 – during which time the employee received a disciplinary letter for allegedly sending inappropriate text messages to a student in their class.Bensenville Village President Frank DeSimone has issued a letter calling for the resignation of Supt. Ongtengco, and anyone who knew of the allegations and failed to take action.On March 29, Ongtengco was placed on administrative leave. Fenton High School Principal Samuel Bentsen was placed in the role on an interim basis.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Despite mild weather, River Valley Tube Park welcomes visitors for winter fun It happened weeks later than hoped, but another area winter attraction has managed to open despite mild January conditions. River Valley Tube Park, near St. Marys, Ont. joins London’s Boler Mountain in offering winter fun. It is the first slide of the season for visitors and some staff families at River Valley Tube Park – and it’s exciting for everyone, including young Sam Ross. “You’re going down super-fast, the ice is in your face,” he said. “It is just honestly thrilling!” And it is a thrill for Sarah Forbes to see. As manager of the park, she’s been waiting weeks for this moment. “We would have liked to have been here, Dec. 26, right before Christmas. But unfortunately, we’re not in charge, the weather gods are. But here we are now,” she said. Sarah Forbes, manager of River Valley Tube Park near St. Marys, Ont. is seen on Jan. 3, 2024. (Sean Irvine/CTV News London)While some snow did fall on St. Marys on Wednesday, it is not nearly enough to get the entire park open. Even with snow machines running, a second tube slope is not expected to open until later in the month. That’s far too late for many in this group, which includes visitors from Scotland. After a week in Canada, they had feared they’d miss enjoying some aspects of a typical Canadian winter. “It’s kind of a bit like Scottish weather now, dreary and not super cold,” said Claire Anghel. A family of snow tubers, including visitors from Scotland, hit up River Valley Tube Park, near St. Marys, Ont., on Jan. 3, 2024. (Sean Irvine/CTV News London)But once on the hill, Claire’s husband and daughter Alice experienced a Canadian thrill. When asked why she was screaming while up on the hill, Alice was all smiles. “Because it was scary and it was really fun!\" she said. In the meantime, Forbes will continue her plea with the sky for more snow. “We hoping this is going to stay. We’re hoping this is going to last. We’re hoping we’re going to get more cold temperatures to make more snow, but again we wait and we see,” she said. Boler Mountain meanwhile hopes to open its tube park next weekend.

Also Read:Top Indian, foreign players for Willingdon squash The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought several wars since winning independence from British rule in 1947, and sporting contests between the two have long been the victim of their enduring animosity. The All India Tennis Association (AITA) asked the sports ministry for approval to travel to Pakistan after a request to shift the fixture to a third country was rejected by the International Tennis Federation tribunal. The proposal is still pending with the ministry and we are awaiting a decision, AITA secretary-general Anil Dhupar told AFP. Pakistan Tennis Federation president Salim Saifullah Khan said 18 members of the Indian squad had requested visas for the World Group 1 clash scheduled for February 3-4. We have all the arrangements put in place. They will be given the best security and accommodation, he told AFP. Let politics be kept away from sports and better sense prevail. New Delhi last hosted the Pakistani tennis team in 2006 and the Indian Davis Cup team last travelled to Islamabad in 1964, according to news outlet India Today.",
