    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes",

    "title": "Dangerous heat and humidity Friday across North Carolina",
    "text": "GREENSBORO, N.C. — It's been hot, but it's going to get hotter for Friday. A combination of high heat and high humidity will raise our heat index to a dangerous level - making it tough to be outside for long during the afternoon and evening. The [WFMY News 2 Weather](/weather) team is issuing a WFMY News 2Weather Impact Alert day for Friday to give a heads up about the heat. We are also expecting some late-day thunderstorms. Here's what we're tracking. Dangerous heat & humidity We've seen a return to hot weather over the last few days. After hitting the 90s for a couple afternoons, Friday will be our hottest day of the week. We are forecasting high temperatures to range between 93 and 97 degrees across the Piedmont-Triad area. But, as you know it's not just the heat. Humidity will be very high on Friday as well with dew point temperatures in the 70s. This humidity makes it harder for our bodies to cool down as they naturally would, adding stress to our systems. It will feel like between 100 and 105 degrees throughout the afternoon and evening hours. This can be a dangerous level of heat and humidity to deal with for our bodies. It's smart to take frequent breaks in air conditioning and stay hydrated if working outside. A Heat Advisory has been issued for the eastern half of our area from 11am to 8pm for Friday. Late-day thunderstorms likely too On top of the heat and humidity, some thunderstorms are likely to move toward and cross the Piedmont for the late afternoon and evening. These boomers could pack a bit of a punch for some of us. With the amount of heat and humidity there will be a lot of fuel for these storms to grow in size as they head our way. We are expecting a line of storms between 3pm in the west and 9pm in the east. Some of the storms could have a damaging wind gust or two on top of torrential rain, lightning, and small hail. It's important to keep an eye on radar and be \"storm ready\" to make sure you're not putting yourself or your family in harms way outside. The WFMY News 2 app has a great interactive radar you can use for free 24/7 to keep ahead of the storms. The threat for severe weather is a 1 out of 5 for Friday afternoon, mostly for damaging wind gusts. Weather Impact Alert Day To recap, we are expecting some dangerous levels of heat and humidity on Friday. This is most likely between 11am and 8pm. It's important to stay hydrated and to take breaks in air conditioning if you have to be working outside Friday. We will also see thunderstorms between 3pm and 9pm. Make sure if you hear thunder to head indoors. Use the WFMY News 2 radar app to help track the storms wherever you are. Stay safe in the heat It's important to know the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke. This can save lives during hot weather. The differences are spelled out below.",

    "text": "The Meteorology General Directorate (MGM) has issued critical warnings for heavy rain, snow, and strong winds in various provinces of Türkiye.\nThese warnings, categorized as yellow and orange alerts, emphasize the risks of flooding, landslides, avalanches and icy conditions.\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of the severe weather expectations and safety recommendations for affected areas.\nThe Diyarbakir Express tourist train offers travelers new experiences along the route from Ankara to Diyarbakir, Türkiye, April 19, 2024. (AA Photo) Severe weather warnings issued for key regions in Türkiye The MGM has flagged multiple provinces with significant weather risks:\nYellow warnings have been issued for Ardahan, Bayburt, Diyarbakir, Erzurum, Giresun, Trabzon and Van Orange warnings , indicating more severe risks, are in place for Rize and Artvin due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding Residents are urged to stay informed and take necessary precautions.\nRain and snow take over: Severe weather to impact large areas of Türkiye Coastal regions in the Marmara and Aegean are forecasted to experience continuous rain, while snow is expected at higher altitudes and inland provinces. Black Sea cities such as Rize and Artvin are likely to receive over 2 inches (51–100 mm) of rainfall.\nElevated areas, especially in eastern Türkiye, could see snow accumulations of up to 8 inches (20 cm), particularly in Bitlis, Van and Hakkari.\nThe Narman Fairy Chimneys in Erzurum have turned white with their unique red landscape even during severe weather conditions in winter, Türkiye, Dec. 3, 2024. (IHA Photo) Türkiye’s eastern provinces brace for extreme cold, snowfall In the east, temperatures will plunge significantly, with Erzurum, Kars, and Ardahan experiencing lows of 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius). Snowfall in these provinces could lead to difficult travel and daily disruptions, with avalanches posing risks in steep areas.\nDiyarbakir and Gaziantep in southeastern Türkiye will see lighter snowfall mixed with rain, while icy roads and dense fog are expected to create travel challenges.\nWinds reaching 37 miles per hour in southeastern provinces could further disrupt transportation and outdoor activities.\nSevere weather to impact Black Sea region: Risks of flooding, landslides Intense rainfall in the Black Sea region raises concerns about flooding and landslides. Trabzon, Giresun, and Artvin are particularly vulnerable to these hazards due to persistent downpours. Flash flooding in urban and rural areas is possible, and residents are advised to monitor updates from local authorities.\nPeople canoeing riding on the Bosphorus with the Blue Mosque and the Ayasofya-i Kebir Camii (or Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque) in the background, in Istanbul on Dec. 1, 2024. (AFP Photo) Temperatures to drop below seasonal norms in Türkiye A cold front moving across Türkiye will bring temperatures below seasonal averages by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius.\nIstanbul will see highs of 50 degrees Fahrenheit with continuous rain throughout the weekend. Ankara will remain colder, with temperatures around 39 degrees Fahrenheit and potential snowfall in surrounding higher areas.\nSouthern regions such as Izmir and Antalya will also experience cooler-than-usual and severe weather conditions. Daytime highs will reach 59 degrees Fahrenheit in Izmir and 66 degrees Fahrenheit in Antalya.\nAvalanche warnings and icy roads prompt caution Avalanche risks are significant in the Black Sea’s mountainous regions and southeastern Anatolia. Steep slopes covered in snow may pose dangers, and authorities recommend avoiding high-risk areas. Ice and frost will create hazardous road conditions across much of the interior and eastern regions. The MGM advises equipping vehicles with winter tires and chains to ensure safe travel.\nRecommendations for staying safe during severe weather conditions in Türkiye Monitor updates: Follow MGM bulletins and local weather reports for real-time information. Secure outdoor items: Protect belongings that could be affected by strong winds. Postpone unnecessary travel: Avoid trips in areas with heavy rainfall, snow, or icy roads. Prepare for emergencies: Keep essential supplies like flashlights, batteries, and first-aid kits ready. Drive carefully: Maintain a safe speed and increase the distance between vehicles on wet or icy roads. Weather outlook for days ahead Western and northern Türkiye will continue to face severe weather conditions with heavy rain and strong winds, while snow and freezing temperatures dominate the central and eastern regions.\nThe current cold front is expected to maintain cooler-than-average conditions across most provinces, with some temporary stabilization before intensifying again.\nResidents and visitors should remain cautious, plan activities around weather conditions, and follow safety measures to minimize disruptions and risks.",

    "title": "Esta es la razón por la que nunca debería apoyar la cabeza en la ventanilla del avión; puede ser perjudicial - Semana",
    "text": "Las personas sueñan con viajar, conocer nuevos lugares y vivir experiencias diferentes: Para ello los medios de transporte son diversos. Una de esas posibilidades son los aviones que permiten realizar recorridos largos, llevando en unas cuantas horas a los destinos favoritos. Sin embargo, un aspecto en el que muy pocas veces se piensa es en el de salubridad. Por tratarse de un espacio cerrado por el que pasan cientos de personas, durante varias horas y debido a que los tiempos entre un vuelo y otro son muy cortos, es muy difícil que se pueda realizar una limpieza a fondo. Normalmente, cuando las aeronaves aterrizan, los pasajeros descienden y ya está listo otro grupo para abordar.Teniendo en cuenta este panorama, es posible que haya partes específicas en estos aparatos que no están tan limpias como se piensa y es por ello que se deben tomar ciertas precauciones, pues se trata de un medio de transporte en el que la falta de ventilación natural y el espacio reducido complican la limpieza.Uno de los lugares que se dice que no recibe un buen aseo es la ventanilla del avión , por lo que es posible que se acumulen bacterias, virus y otros patógenos, lo que aumenta el riesgo de exposición a gérmenes. Por este motivo, los asistentes de cabina aconsejan mantener, en la medida de lo posible, las manos y la cabeza alejadas de la ventana.La azafata conocida como @cherdallas en Tik Tok, compartió en esta red social detalles de las áreas que, según ella, rara vez se limpian a fondo. En lo que tiene que ver con la ventana, dijo que este elemento es uno de los más manipulados por los pasajeros, pero no recibe una atención durante el proceso de limpieza. Lo complejo de esto es que muchos viajeros suelen apoyarse en ella o colocar sus manos para ajustarla. “Están sucias”, dijo. Así las cosas, lo ideal es, por temas de higiene, no apoyar la cabeza en esta parte del avión, pues puede ser perjudicial para la salud. Es frecuente que los viajeros apliquen esta práctica y más si se trata de un viaje largo. Para muchos, recostar la cabeza es una forma de descansar, dormir y vivir una experiencia de vuelo más cómoda, pero es clave tener presente estas condiciones.Un punto más a tener en cuenta es que de forma frecuente los aviones experimentan variaciones en la atmósfera, lo que es posible que ocasiones movimientos bruscos y si un pasajero tiene la cabeza apoyada en la ventana, los movimientos inesperados pueden hacer que se presenten golpes contra el cristal con suficiente fuerza como para causar una lesión en el cuello o en la cabeza.Por seguridad Sin embargo, el tema de salubridad no es la única razón. Los expertos recomiendan no apoyar la cabeza en la ventanilla del avión debido a temas de seguridad. Se dice que si bien estas partes están fabricadas con capas de vidrio y plástico que resisten las diferencias de presión entre el interior y el exterior del avión; el apoyo constante de un pasajero sobre el cristal puede ejercer una presión adicional.",

Chapter 7 also got a few adjustments added that fixed some NPC behavior and an unintended puzzle solution. Chapter 6 of The Plucky Squire received the biggest update out of all the chapters. Fixes were made that prevent the game from potentially crashing during a mini-game. Alongside this, several objects such as crates and words received updates to prevent them from reaching inaccessible locations. Finally, issues such as Zip not following Jot properly, players getting stuck in certain areas, and mini-game objectives not being shown have also been fixed. These updates are currently live on the Nintendo Switch version of The Plucky Squire. While future patches and updates to the game on other platforms are not live yet, the developers stated that those changes are currently in the works.

    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Illinois (UIUC) men's basketball guard Terrence Shannon Jr. turned himself in on a rape charge and posted bail at the Douglas County Jail on Thursday, according to a UIUC press release. Shannon traveled to Lawrence Thursday, where he was booked on a rape charge and posted a $50,000 bond, after the Douglas County District Attorney issued an arrest warrant for him on Wednesday. After posting a $50,000 bail, Shannon made the trip back to Champaign, Illinois, according to the UIUC press release. In accordance with Division of Intercollegiate Athletics (DIA) policy, Shannon was immediately suspended from all team activities, per the release. The alleged incident happened during a trip Shannon made as a spectator to the Illinois vs. Kansas football game in Lawrence on Friday, Sept. 8, per the UIUC press release. \"He was not in Lawrence on official University business, not was he a member of the University's travel party,\" the press release said. The press release states DIA and UIUC officials were made aware of the Lawrence police investigation into the alleged incident in late September, but did not have enough information to take action until Wednesday. \"The University and DIA have shown time and again that we have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,\" UIUC Director of Athletics Josh Whitman said in the press release. \"At the same time, DIA policy affords student-athletes appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations. We will rely on that policy and our prior experience to manage this situation appropriately for the University and the involved parties.\" —",
