    "title": "Blindfire Is a Lightless Twist on a Multiplayer Shooter: Early Access Launched",
    "text": "There’s no doubt that multiplayer shooters are slowly getting a bit stale but with Blindfire, things are about to go dark. In the Xbox Partner Preview 2024, we had our first glimpse at the upcoming FPS based on a unique mechanic. Blindfire, the new FPS, emphasizes trusting your instincts. Play in the dark, relying on equipment, abilities, and senses.\nThe signature game mode for the game is the Bodycount mode . Blindfire’s Bodycount mode offers both solo and team play, allowing you to dive in alone or with friends. Each player gets only one life per round in this five-round points battle.\nThe most direct way to win is consistent top finishes, but lurking in the shadows for easy kills won’t cut it. To maximize points, showcase your skills with headshots, multi-kills, first blood, and damage-free survival. Active engagement is key to success.\nBlindfire Emphasizes the Sweet Sound of Violence Lead Designer Matt Dunthorne describes the game as a fantastic concept. The game is all about trusting your sound senses, reflexes, and the ability to utilize your kit. He says: “The beautiful thing about the concept in my opinion is how pure the core idea is, there is no fluff or excess and it can be explained in a single sentence. It’s a pitch-black room, you have a gun, and so do your enemies… good luck!” Well, not just enemies, even allies positioning matters as you might end up shooting them in the dark as well.\nTo tackle the blindness, you must embrace the dark. Well, not exactly but you must trust your ears. And the creators have focused on sound design as a primary element, compensating for limited visuals. Dunthorne explains:\n“We wanted to ensure players could be confident enough of an enemies’ location to risk taking a shot using audio alone.”\nTo keep things balanced, everyone will start with the same abilities and weapons. On reveal day, you can choose between the Mantis, a precise pistol, and the Abolition, a rapid-fire shotgun. This will rotate and developers have promised to keep things fair for everyone.\nBlindfire is available in early access through the Xbox Game Preview program on Xbox Series X|S and Windows PC today. So, if you want to have a shot in the dark, try Blindfire right now. What do you think about this uniquely deadly game? Let us know in the comments below.",

    "title": "Bolivia government had prior intelligence of coup planning, minister says",
    "text": "The Bolivian government had intelligence that a coup attempt could occur before the country's top military commander and his troops forced their way into the presidential palace this week, a senior government minister said on Thursday.\nThe failed coup on Wednesday happened over just a few hours and provoked swift condemnations from world leaders, raising fears that democracy in the Andean nation remains at risk.\nIn an interview with Bolivian broadcaster Unitel, Interior Minister Eduardo del Castillo said that President Luis Arce received reports about \"destabilization attempts,\" though he cautioned that the government did not know more at the time.\nThe mobilization of military units on Wednesday saw the country's military commander gather troops in the main square of capital La Paz, ramming a palace door with an armored vehicle to allow soldiers to rush into the building.\nThe soldiers ultimately withdrew and police regained control of the square, with Arce slamming the coup attempt and swiftly naming a new top general.\nThe former commander, Juan Jose Zuniga, was arrested as well as former Navy commander Juan Arnez Salvador, del Castillo said. He later explained that 17 people had been detained so far, but there were \"many more who had participated.\"\nDuring a Thursday morning session of the Organization of American States (OAS) held in Paraguay, Bolivia's ambassador said around 200 military officers took part in the short-lived operation led by Zuniga.\nElsewhere, calls for accountability for the attempted coup grew louder.\n\"I urge the authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into allegations of violence and reports of injuries,\" said U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Turk. \"Those responsible must be held to account.\"\nZuniga had recently said that Arce's former mentor-turned-political-rival, ex-President Evo Morales, should not be able to run again for president and threatened to block him if he attempted to do so.\nThe commander had been told on Tuesday evening that he would be stripped of his position as his conduct \"was not in line with the Constitution,\" according to del Castillo.\nHe recalled that Zuniga reacted calmly to the news.\n\"But no one could have imagined that the next day, before the official handover in posts, there would be a failed coup in our country,\" he said.\nLate Wednesday, Minister of the Presidency Maria Nela Prada told reporters that Zuniga, in his confession to police, said the coup attempt failed because reinforcements did not arrive in time.\nAs he was being arrested, Zuniga said that he had been instructed to carry out the coup at Arce's direction in order to boost the president's popularity, which Prada later denied.",
