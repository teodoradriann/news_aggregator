    "title": "Mamá de Dani Alves se defendió y asegura que no se arrepiente de revelar la identidad de la víctima: “Todo será demostrado”",
    "text": "El exfutbolista Dani Alves se encuentra en prisión desde el pasado 20 de enero de 2023, después de ser acusado de agresión sexual en contra de una joven. Los hechos se habrían presentado al interior de un baño de una discoteca de Barcelona llamada Sutton, donde, al parecer, el exjugador habría obligado a la víctima a realizarle sexo oral. Desde ese momento, el proceso de Alves ha pasado por diferentes etapas y se ha vuelto algo muy mediático, siendo muy complicado debido a diferentes circunstancias que se han presentado como, por ejemplo, el cambio de versión por parte del exintegrante de la plantilla del Barcelona. En un principio, dijo que no hubo ningún encuentro sexual con la mujer, pero pocas semanas después cambió sus palabras. Otra de las grandes polémicas ocurrió a inicios de este año 2024, cuando la mamá del futbolista, Lucía Alves, reveló supuestamente los datos de la joven afectada. La progenitora, al parecer, habría difundido un montaje en el que se pone en duda la veracidad de las acusaciones. Por ello, la víctima presentó una denuncia en los juzgados de Barcelona. La madre del exfutbolista publicó un video en el que se ve a la joven bailando y celebrando su cumpleaños, audiovisual que fue grabado por una abogada brasileña. “Quien confía en Dios ya no pierde la batalla”, escribió la mamá de Dani Alves. “No cometí ningún crimen” La situación ha generado gran controversia en Brasil y ha polemizado aún más el caso del exfutbolista. Sin embargo, tal parece que Lucía Alves no se arrepiente de sus acciones y sigue creyendo en la inocencia de su hijo. En las últimas horas, realizó una nueva publicación en la que se refirió a la filtración que habría realizado de los datos de la víctima. A través de su cuenta de Instagram, donde acumula más de 19 mil seguidores, la mujer sostuvo que con el paso del tiempo la verdad será conocida y recalcó que no ha cometido ningún delito. “Yo no cometí ningún crimen y todo será demostrado, solo hay que esperar”, escribió. Además, su abogada Graciele Queiroz también salió en su defensa y, al igual que el mensaje, afirmó que Lucía no incurrió en ninguna práctica ilegal. “La señora Lucía no cometió ningún crimen. De hecho, fue engañada por mensajes. ¿Cómo consiguieron su número y saben quién era la presunta víctima? Algo está mal, demostraremos la verdad”, expresó. El grave lío de la mamá de Alves Más allá de las versiones, la madre del exlateral derecho enfrenta un grave problema judicial. Desde que inició el juicio en contra de su hijo, las autoridades indicaron que los datos de la víctima e imágenes eran reservados, por lo que estaba prohibido que fueran reveladas y más a los medios de comunicación. El medio Sport de España explica que las imágenes fueron sacadas de las redes sociales de la víctima y de sus seres cercanos. “En ellas se hace un repaso de la actividad de ocio de la mujer y se intenta criminalizar su vida personal”, dijo el medio.La situación para la mamá de Dani Alves podría agravarse debido a que, al parecer, algunas de las fotos son de cuando la víctima era menor de edad. Más allá de la polémica y las versiones de las partes, el caso deberá solucionarse en los estrados judiciales.",

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces",
    "text": "PA Media: UK News Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces Read full article Ian Jones and Aine Fox, PA December 29, 2023 at 2:01 a.m. · 5 min read The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\nStory continues “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "People with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes may face heart disease up to 28 years earlier than others, according to research presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2024.\nThe study examined cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, analyzing simulated patient profiles of men and women aged 30-79. Researchers found elevated cardiovascular risks can begin decades earlier in those with kidney disease or diabetes compared to healthy individuals.\n“Our study shows that risk for cardiovascular disease varies significantly based on a person’s age and other health conditions,” said lead researcher Vaishnavi Krishnan of Northwestern University. “Individuals with diabetes or kidney disease are at a much higher risk for heart disease even in their 30s.”\nThe research identified chronic kidney disease through an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 44.5, indicating stage 3 kidney disease. Women without CKM conditions typically see increased cardiovascular risk around age 68, while men face elevated risk at 63.\n“This is truly a call to action, to both identify those at such risk and to begin more aggressive treatment earlier than we have traditionally felt necessary,” said Dr. Richard Wright, board-certified cardiologist.\nThe findings suggest even borderline high blood pressure, glucose levels or kidney function may pose hidden risks before formal diagnosis.\nDr. Cheng-Han Chen, board-certified interventional cardiologist, emphasized the need for coordinated care. “By considering these conditions in concert, we may be able to come up with better treatments to help improve health outcomes,” Chen said.\nHealth care providers should consider:\n– Earlier screening for cardiovascular risks\n– More aggressive treatment protocols\n– Integrated management of kidney and heart conditions\n– Regular monitoring of patients with borderline readings\n– Coordinated care among specialists\nThe research could lead to revised guidelines for preventing heart disease in patients with kidney disorders and diabetes.",

    "text": "Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Awareness Campaign The U of A owns and maintains a natural gas pipeline that runs through the south side of campus. As part of its responsibilities in creating a safe and informed Fayetteville community, the U of A sent an annual notice out this week to key public officials around the city and Washington County this week. The pipeline was established in 2016 and significantly decreases the university's greenhouse gas footprint, which is a primary sustainability goal at the U of A. The notice included information about the pipeline, such as its exact location and its primary function, and also lists signs of a gas leak, how to identify them, and what to do if you are in the area of a gas leak. The information is consistent with the university's commitment to safety in all gas pipeline operations. In addition to notifying local officials, all addresses within 600 feet of the pipeline are sent materials to help bring awareness to proper protocols in the unlikely event of an incident. The university routinely participates in safety procedure exercises to prepare first responders in the case of a pipeline emergency. Contractors and excavators who work on campus are also taught damage prevention, leak recognition and response, and are required to call Arkansas One Call for the location of the line before doing any work on a property. Natural gas pipelines are typically very safe, and incidents are very rare. Members of campus should be aware of the following symptoms of a pipeline leak to ensure safety around the pipeline on campus: - Strong odor (gaseous, chemical or \"rotten eggs\") - Unusual hissing or roaring noise - Large sections of dead vegetation - Flames coming from the ground - A cloud of vapor, fog, or mist - Dirt blowing in the air If you detect a potential leak, leave the area and tell those around you to leave. Once you are a safe distance away, call 911. If you have any questions about the pipeline, you can call University Police at 479-575-2222.

    "title": "Don't look so blue, Neptune: Now astronomers know this planet's true color",
    "text": "When Voyager 2 flew by Neptune in 1989, it sent back images that were processed to better reveal features like bands and a dark spot. But a new study says it’s actually a greener planet. NASA/JPL-Caltech hide caption\ntoggle caption NASA/JPL-Caltech\nIn 1989, Voyager 2 became the first and only spacecraft to ever fly by Neptune, and images from that mission famously show a planet that’s a deep azure color.\nBut in reality, Neptune is far more of a light greenish blue. It’s actually pretty similar in color to its fellow ice giant Uranus, also visited by Voyager 2.\n“We find that the planets are different colors, but the difference in color was nothing like what you see when you Google for images of Uranus and Neptune,” says Patrick Irwin, a planetary physicist at the University of Oxford.\nIrwin led a team that did a new analysis that’s just been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\nThe images taken by Voyager 2 when it passed Neptune in 1989 were originally processed to better reveal its distinctive features, but as a result they made the planet look too blue. P. Irwin hide caption\ntoggle caption P. Irwin\nThe researchers rebalanced composite color images taken by the Voyager 2 camera, using data from instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope as well as the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope.\nThe resulting images more accurately reflect the true colors of these planets, says Irwin, as they’d be seen by the naked eye.\nAs a result, some of the key features of Neptune, such as cloud bands and a dark spot, become “indistinct and difficult to see,” he says, noting that the Voyager team deliberately processed its images in a way that would highlight the unusual features of this planet.\n“This is a very common thing to do. You’re effectively trying to tell a story and to point out to your audience what the interesting features of those images might be,” says Leigh Fletcher, an astronomer with the University of Leicester. “But even amateur astronomers looking through their own backyard telescopes up at Uranus and Neptune knew that the contrast in colors between those two worlds was rather more subtle than maybe the original NASA’s images first let on.”\nAlthough Voyager scientists were open about how they processed their images, says Irwin, the subtleties of those decisions have gotten lost over the decades as the images of Neptune and Uranus have been endlessly reproduced.\n“People now just think, ‘Well, that’s how they look,'” Irwin says, adding that when people see his team’s new vision of Neptune, they’re “quite surprised.”\nIn addition to rebalancing Neptune’s colors, the research team also investigated the unusual color changes seen on Uranus during its 84-year orbit of the sun.\nUsing observations taken from 1950 to 2016 by the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, they found that Uranus appears a little greener at its solstices, when one of the planet’s poles is pointed toward the sun.\nBut when the sun is over the equator, Uranus looks a bit bluer.\nThe researchers attribute this color change to the fact that the poles have less methane than the equator, plus they have an increased amount of icy haze.\n“We now have a model capable of explaining why those subtle colors are changing,” says Fletcher, who notes that it took decades of data and calculations that can replicate how light interacts with various gases and aerosols.\nIn a description of the new research released by the Royal Astronomical Society, Heidi Hammel, of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), is quoted as saying that astronomers have been bedeviled for decades by the misperceptions of Neptune’s color, as well as the color changes of Uranus.\n“This comprehensive study,” Hammel said, “should finally put both issues to rest.”\nSome astronomers have long lobbied for a new mission out to one of the ice giant planets, and an influential priority-setting panel for astronomy recently put a robotic mission to orbit Uranus at the top of its wish list.\n“We’re talking about launch dates in the 2030s and not arriving until 10 years later,” says Irwin. “So it’s to be beyond my professional career, but hopefully not my life.”\nFletcher says no one really knows what the insides of these ice giants are like, and there’s certain regions of these planets and their moons that no human or robotic eyes have ever seen.\n“Going out to these destinations will be revealing environments, revealing landscapes, revealing atmospheres that nobody’s ever seen before,” he says, adding that it’s one of the few places left in the solar system with the potential to make such discoveries.",

    "text": "All homes that lost power as Storm Gerrit lashed Scotland have now been reconnected, bosses at power firm SSEN have confirmed. The electricity provider said its teams had worked through “particularly challenging conditions” to restore supplies to more than 48,000 homes. A final push by staff saw the last properties without electricity reconnected by 11pm on Friday, with customers in parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen area in the Highlands all now with power again. Andy Smith, SSEN distribution’s operations director, said the storm had brought “serious disruption” with gale force winds having reached recorded speeds of 86mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire and 84mph in Lerwick, Shetland. We have restored power to all 48,000 customers who lost supply due to the impacts of [#StormGerrit] We thank customers for their patience and understanding while our teams worked to restore supplies in challenging conditions. Visit [https://t.co/k2dlReZv4G]for the full update — Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (@ssencommunity) [December 30, 2023] Mr Smith said: “Storm Gerrit caused serious disruption across the north of Scotland, and I would like to say thank you to our customers for their patience while we worked through some particularly challenging conditions to reconnect them, as quickly and safely as possible. “I’m very proud of the work undertaken by SSEN’s operational teams, and for being out at all hours and in all weathers to find and fix the faults over the past few days. “I would also like to extend my gratitude to our contract partners and fellow network operators for how they supported our response.” It will be a frosty and cold start to Saturday for some, particularly across Scotland ❄️ Heavy rain and strong winds will sweep north-eastwards through the morning, bringing some hill snow in the north 🌧️ Cloudy in the far southeast but largely dry ☁️ [pic.twitter.com/8xDdK4njGR] — Met Office (@metoffice) [December 30, 2023] SSEN is now encouraging customers who were left without power to apply for compensation, depending on how long they were without electricity for. Completion of work to restore electricity supplies comes ahead of the latest weather alert, with a yellow warning for rain and snow having been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. As a result of that Network Rail Scotland said speed restrictions will be in place on the West Highland Lines from 10am today until 9am on Sunday.",
