    "text": "It is very well known by know that there is a lot of snow on the ground in Buffalo as the Bills hosted the Steelers for the Wild Card round of the\nNFL Playoffs. Upstate New York was hammered by a massive three-day winter storm that warranted a state of emergency and dumped more than two feet across the region.\nHighmark Stadium, home of the\nBuffalo Bills, was not the outlier.\nLocal residents were offered $20 an hour to try and clear the stands prior to kickoff. Their efforts helped some, but it was largely inefficient. There was just too much snow in too short of time.\nAs a result, fans were forced to\nplow their way through waist-deep powder to get to their seats like a husky in the Iditarod. One particular image from remarkably talented freelance Kathryn Riley really puts the conditions in perspective.\nBelieve it or not, these two women are actually sitting in their assigned seats at Highmark Stadium:\nThat’s next-level fandom. Dedicated is not a strong enough word to describe the folks who trekked through the snow to watch their team play in sub-freezing temperatures…\nEspecially if you’re going to show up in a full Bills uniform!\nAlthough the field itself was cleared by kickoff, it still qualifies as a snow game and the scenes were epic. The stadium looked like a blizzard as soon as Dawson Knox scored the first touchdown even though there wasn’t any actual precipitation falling from the sky.\nHere is how it looked on the CBS broadcast:\n— NFL (@NFL)\n[#BillsMafia]was made for snow games.\n📺:\n[#PITvsBUF]on CBS\n📱: Stream on\n[#NFLPlus] [pic.twitter.com/XrqPThnCUr] [January 15, 2024]\nIt was even cooler from the perspective of the upper deck.\nPOV video from the touchdown celebration might be the best look. They made it snow!\nTo be a card-carrying member of Bills Mafia requires a passion and dedication that is not shared by many. Incredible scenes on Monday!",

    "text": "Employee allegedly laid off for refusing to work overtime: ‘Saw her leaving in tears’\nA long-time employee was allegedly laid off due to her refusal to work overtime.\nAn employee at a reputed multinational company (MNC) in the product-based sector was abruptly asked to resign after 3.5 years, reportedly due to budget constraints, leaving colleagues stunned. However, some believe the real reason was her refusal to work overtime. A coworker took to social media to recall, “I saw her leaving the office in tears,” questioning why only one person was let go if budget cuts were genuinely the reason.\nTaking to Reddit, another employee shared his concerns about the incident, describing how the company was known for its great and flexible culture, with many employees staying for decades. However, this sudden layoff made them reconsider their perception. The departing employee was known for speaking her mind and refusing to overwork, unlike others who silently accepted additional responsibilities. This has led to speculation that her dismissal may have been influenced by her straightforward approach rather than financial reasons.\nAlso read: Infosys, Wipro, TCS among tech giants blacklisted in US recruiter's leaked email: 'Not the right fit'\n“What I found strange is that if budget cuts were really the issue, there should have been more layoffs, not just one person,” wrote the user.\nTake a look at the post:\nFollowing the post, many Reddit users weighed in, with some advising employees to navigate workplace politics carefully. One user wrote, “Sadly, you must play politics in corporate. Don’t just blatantly refuse work. She should have refused in a diplomatic way.” Others echoed similar views, emphasising the importance of strategic communication in corporate settings.\nAnother user added, “Dont trust a picture just by one perspective. Anyone who is laid off always has a story where the company/boss was the villain and they were not. Secondly, they are all colleagues, and if you are scared, so are your bosses and management. Do your due diligence, make yourself important to the company and though you still might be laid off, at least your chances will be lesser.”\nHT.com has not independently verified these claims.\nAlso read: ‘Dhoom Machale’ plays at Westminster Abbey for King Charles, desi viewers in disbelief Trending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and Weather Updatesof India and around the world Trending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and Weather Updatesof India and around the world",

En declaraciones a la prensa, el ministro descartó que las autoridades no puedan ubicar al exgobernador de Junín sentenciado por corrupción durante su gestión. “Todos los niveles de Inteligencia del país, llámase DINI, Digemin, Dirin, están trabajando al respecto, en armonía y en conjunto con la Policía Nacional del Perú”, aseguró. Vladimir Cerrón se encuentra en la clandestinidad desde octubre del 2023, cuando el Poder Judicial dictó una orden de prisión efectiva en su contra por el caso Aeródromo Wanka, además de enfrentar un pedido de prisión preventiva en su contra por otro proceso en investigación por supuesto lavado de activos. “La policía está cerca y garantizamos que todo este tema se va a corregir, se va a solucionar y se va a capturar”, insistió el ministro del Interior. En la víspera, y ante la información sobre un supuesto intento de Cerrón Rojas de buscar asilo en una embajada como la de Bolivia o Cuba, el jefe de la Dirección de Investigación Criminal (Dirincri) de la Policía, general Óscar Arriola, aseguró que están trabajando todos los días para dar con el prófugo. “Nosotros somos los buenos policías que estamos atrás de Cerrón y de todas las personas que tienen deudas con la justicia y garantizamos que va a caer, aquí o en cualquier lugar del mundo”, aseguró este miércoles a RPP.",

    "text": "Could your travel be affected by the looming storm? Here's what you need to know\nThe period between Christmas and New Year's Day is traditionally both a\nvery popular travel period and a time when many parts of the country are at risk of winter storms and other weather-related issues.\nAt the start of the week, a blizzard that began in midwestern states of Nebraska, Kansas and South Dakota steadily moved east and led to flood advisories and thousands of\nflight delays in cities such as New York and Washington, D.C. Related: These are the worst times to travel during the holiday season\nStatistics from FlightAware show that over 8,000 flights were canceled across the U.S. on Dec. 26 just as hundreds of thousands of travelers were attempting to get home from Christmas travel. As one of the epicenters of the storm, Denver International Airport was hit particularly hard with over 48% of departing flights delayed and 1% canceled.\nWinter storms and flooding hit Midwest but flights are back to normal for now\nAs Southwest Airlines (\nLUV) - Get Free Report operates a major hub out of the city, the airline had a wave of delays and cancelations reminiscent of the much more severe 2022 post-Christmas fiasco.\nMore Travel:\nA new travel term is taking over the internet (and reaching airlines and hotels) The 10 best airline stocks to buy now Airlines see a new kind of traveler at the front of the plane\nWhile the Midwestern storm has since slowed down slightly and allowed airlines to restart flights and redirect travelers to their destinations after brief delays, parts of New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia are currently under flood advisories.\nThe Flood Watch affects more than 10 million people and, while flights are currently operating as normal, airports are under alert for potential problems if the situation gets worse. As always in the case of bad weather, several airlines reminded travelers to periodically check the status of their flight online to avoid an unnecessary trip to the airport.\nFor the weekend ahead, storms and more heavy rains are predicted for parts of the Pacific Northwest and California. Los Angeles and San Francisco are on particularly high alert for Saturday, Dec. 30.\n\"A band of locally heavy rain lasting for several hours in any one spot will press inland to end the week and start the weekend,\" Accuweather Senior Meteorologist Heather Zehr\nsaid of the forecast. \"Rainfall totals will be somewhat limited by the short time frame the precipitation can fall but can still be noteworthy,\"\nIn or heading to the UK? There are bad storms there too\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean in the United Kingdom, winds of up to 80 miles per hour brought over by Storm Gerrit from the Atlantic pushed International Aviation Group (\nBABWF) - https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=BABWF-owned British Airways to cancel at least 20 flights in London and Bristol airports on Wednesday, Dec. 27. Many of those were flights carrying passengers home from European cities such as Barcelona, Paris and Rome and Aberdeen but many outgoing flights to the same destinations were also canceled.\n\"We have apologized to our customers for any disruption to their travel plans and our teams are working hard to get them on their way as quickly as possible,\" a British Airways spokesperson said of the changes.\nA video of a Boeing 777 (\nBA) - https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=BA bouncing on the runway while struggling to land in the fog and wind has also been going viral on social media (the pilot landed it safely without any injuries.)

    "text": "El jefe del buró político de Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, comunicó este lunes a Egipto y a Qatar que el grupo islamista palestino ha aceptado su propuesta para un alto el fuego en la Franja de Gaza. Hamas hizo el anuncio en un breve comunicado en el que no ofreció más detalles, después de que el Ejército israelí ordenara a unos 100.000 palestinos en el este de Rafah evacuar la localidad ante un posible asalto terrestre. \"Ismail Haniyeh, líder del buró político del movimiento Hamas, realizó una llamada con el primer ministro catarí, Mohammed ben Abdulrahman Al Thani, y con el ministro de Inteligencia egipcio, Abás Kamel, y les informó de la aprobación por parte del movimiento Hamas de su propuesta sobre un acuerdo de alto el fuego\", dijo el grupo palestino. De momento no se conocen los detalles de la propuesta, ni la postura oficial de las autoridades israelíes, aunque, según medios como la cadena pública Kan o el canal 12 de noticias, el acuerdo aceptado por Hamas no cuenta con la luz verde de Israel. Los medios, que citan a funcionarios gubernamentales israelíes, dijeron que la oferta que ha aceptado Hamas fue realizada por Egipto de manera unilateral, y que de momento no está siendo tomada en cuenta hasta que no se aclaren los detalles. Parecía que las negociaciones indirectas entre Hamas e Israel para lograr un alto el fuego en la Franja de Gaza estaban estancadas, después de que el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, rechazara ayer poner fin a la guerra, demanda clave del grupo islamista. Esta mañana, de hecho, miles de palestinos en la localidad sureña de Rafah recibieron mensajes instándolos a evacuar a la zona de Jan Yunis, haciendo saltar las alarmas ante la posibilidad de que el Ejército comience pronto con su anunciada invasión terrestre en el sur de Gaza. Poco antes del mensaje de Hamas, el ministro israelí de Defensa, Yoav Gallant, aseguró en un encuentro con familiares de rehenes que el Ejército seguirá tratando de liberarlos incluso después de que comience el asalto por tierra a Rafah. El grupo islamista advirtió hoy a las fuerzas israelíes de que cualquier operación militar en Rafah \"no será un picnic\", y que el brazo armado del grupo, las Brigadas al Qasam, están preparadas para \"defender a nuestro pueblo\". Hamas pidió además a los organismos internacionales que todavía operan en el enclave, y en particular a la agencia de la ONU para los refugiados palestinos, que no lo abandonen tras las órdenes de evacuación israelíes.",

    "title": "Green finance: navigating the future of sustainable investment",
    "text": "Green finance has become a new buzz phrase; an economic lever to help drive environmental solutions that address the climate crisis.\nHere in Scotland, it’s an idea already being put into practise, with initiatives like the Facility for Investment Ready in Nature in Scotland (FIRNS) programme, funded by the Scottish Government and NatureScot.\nBut can financial markets be used to foster environmental progress?\nFrom climate to green\nFirst let’s look at where green finance came from.\nA strong driver has been awareness of climate change. Financial products like green bonds and funds emerged as ways to fund climate mitigation.\nIn 2007, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued its first green bonds and these provided a model for financing environmental projects.\nThis led to the development of other green financial instruments across the world and the establishment of the green bond principles, a set of voluntary guidelines for issuing green bonds, by the International Capital Market Association, in 2014.\nThe green bond principles, focusing on the use of funds, project selection and reporting outcomes, have helped standardise green bonds and boost investor confidence in them, leading to the market's expansion.\nGreen finance has also evolved beyond bonds and the energy market to encompass a wider range of natural capital projects, like nature restoration, marine conservation and river catchment protection.\nGlobal trends in green finance adoption\nGlobally, there are varying degrees of adoption and integration of green finance.\nEurope, as shown by the EIB with its 2007 green bond, then the green bond principles, was a pioneer and now shows some maturity.\nThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has also had strong ambitions, aiming to have 50% of its authorised funding as green by 2025 and cumulative climate finance approval of $50bn by 2030.\nOther nations are further behind, with more traditional ideas of economic growth outweighing environmental concerns.\nHowever, even in these places, awareness of climate change is driving a trend towards sustainable investments. Connections between long-term economic and environmental health are also being made.\nThe UK as a key proponent of green finance\nThe UK is actively promoting high-integrity green finance.\nThe UK Government’s 2023 Green Finance Strategy focuses on initiatives like automating small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) sustainability reporting and addressing finance linked to deforestation.\nThe Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, together with the governments of all parts of the UK, has commissioned the production of the Nature Investments Standards Programme by the British Standards Institution.\nThe UK Government also collaborates with organisations on green finance-funded projects, including the commissioning of investment readiness pilots for nature management initiatives.\nScotland’s green investment landscape\nIn Scotland, green finance is recognised as an opportunity.\nThe Scottish Government has published Interim Principles for Responsible Investment in Natural Capital, which includes strong commitments around community involvement and empowerment in nature restoration.\nThe Scottish Land Commission’s guidelines on Responsible Natural Capital and Carbon Management have also out set practical expectations for landowners and managers around their rights and responsibilities in managing natural capital and carbon.\nScotland also has the FIRNS, which grants aim to boost business cases and financial models for projects that aim to both restore nature and generate income streams for investors and local communities.\nAs these projects develop, they will hopefully build understanding around how and when investments in natural capital can be profitable, ethical and make positive impacts on both the environment and community wellbeing.\nChallenges for green finance\nDespite the progress, there are many concerns around the perceived risks associated with green finance.\nOne is that, despite a growing volume of 'green' transactions, there is a lag in the environmental impacts they are expected to make being fully realised.\nThis could be due to a number of reasons. It could be that it just takes time for the impacts of business change on ecological systems to make themselves felt. Or that well-intentioned changes by businesses just don’t produce the environmental results as expected.\nThere is also concern is that many are just greenwashing. This is where companies promote their products and services as environmentally friendly, but may not actually have a sincere commitment to the environment, which cannot be proven without adequate verification.\nFor example, many current voluntary carbon markets allow companies to offset emissions without having to show they have significantly reduced their carbon footprint. In other words, they lack the integrity, mentioned earlier, and can simply continue to emit.\nAccording to a report by RepRisk, in 2022/2023 there was a 70% increase in incidents of climate- related greenwashing in the financial services sector. These practices misguide consumers and investors and erode trust in genuine green initiatives.\nA lack of global standards also means there are inconsistencies in funding and evaluation, which make it hard to understand the multiple consequences of green finance. This highlights the need for both clearer standards, and for more research and evaluation of the multiple consequences of green finance.\nAnother challenge is that while there are sometimes many investable projects, they’re just not at the value investors are looking for.\nAccording to a study on Nature based solutions by the EIB, in Europe there’s interest from private finance in projects valued at more than €10m, but the investable projects identified are looking for less than €2m, with 44% needing under €1m.\nThere can also be concerns around how rural communities are impacted by investment projects when they are not taken into consideration.\nClarity, stability and context\nSo how do we move forward?\nRegulations and policy can be a strong lever for change in green finance. Widely adopted rules and standards can be useful for helping to bring clarity, as well as setting minimum requirements.\nWithout them, too many different or isolated green financial products can confuse investors and deter them from backing green finance.\nInvestment priorities are also influenced by external factors, such as public opinion and the economic and political climate, which can push green investment down the priority list.\nChanges in policy and regulations for other sectors can also have an impact, affecting project prioritisation and subsidies.\nAn example is the upcoming Agriculture Bill in Scotland, which aims to drive a transition to sustainable and regenerative agriculture and integrating nature restoration and climate adaptation. In principle, this should help complement and support nature-based finance, but it will be the detail that’s important, both for what the policy achieves directly and how it interacts with green finance.\nUntil then, there will be some uncertainty for many land managers around the decisions they make.\nAt Hutton, my research - funded by the Macaulay Development Trust - is dedicated to developing financial mechanisms that align with Scotland's environmental objectives.\nAs part of a wider research team here, I’m exploring financial models and investment strategies that encourage responsible land use, crucial for biodiversity and environmental preservation. This research contributes to the work of the Social, Economic and Geographical Sciences department, where interdisciplinary efforts address complex environmental and social challenges.\nAdditionally, I’m assessing the impact of these mechanisms on diverse social-economic groups to promote equitable and sustainable practices.\nDr Umar Farooq is the new green finance fellow at the James Hutton Institute",
