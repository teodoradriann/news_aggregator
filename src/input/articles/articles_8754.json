    "text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a new wave of airstrikes on Wednesday against “military targets” in the capital of Iran, including an attack on the headquarters of the Iranian police and also sites where nuclear weapons are being developed.\nPUBLICIDAD\nThe Disciplinary Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran (abbreviated Faraja or NAJA) issued a statement indicating that “several” agents were injured following attacks on “some buildings in the vicinity” of its headquarters, as reported by the IRNA news agency.\nPUBLICIDAD\nConflict between Israel and Iran lasted six days\n“The Air Force is attacking military targets of the Iranian regime in the Tehran area,” the IDF stated in a brief message on their social media account X, without initially specifying the targets attacked on this occasion.\"\nOn the other hand, the Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, has indeed stated on social media that the Israeli Air Force planes “destroyed the Iranian regime’s internal security headquarters”. “We will continue to damage government symbols and attack the ayatollahs’ regime everywhere,” he added.\nFurthermore, according to NBC News, among the 20 sites attacked today in Tehran, there were some sites where, according to Israel, nuclear weapons projects were being developed.\nThe spokesperson for the Israeli Army, Effie Defrin, stated that Israeli forces had attacked “more than 1,100” targets in Iran so far. “We are working systematically to neutralize the Iranian threat in all its aspects,” he said, without any response from Iranian authorities regarding these attacks.\nCyberattack against the Iranian state television\nThe Iranian state television, IRIB, was targeted by cyberattacks during the afternoon. \"If you see interruptions or inappropriate messages on several TV channels, it is due to enemy interference in satellite waves,\" explained a presenter, after the government imposed temporary restrictions on internet access.\nIranian authorities also confirmed an attempt to attack the country’s banking system, which “caused the interruption of services in at least two banks in the country.”",

And these technologies are changing how cancers are being treated, and we are saving lives daily.\" (KRCG) TOPICS:\nMURR Nuclear medicine Research reactor Radioactive isotopes Cancer treatments University of Missouri Collaboration Lutetium 177 The highest-powered university research reactor in the country is expanding.\nOfficials held a ribbon cutting today at the research reactor north building, dubbed \"MURR West.\"\n\"In our entire history, nearly 60 years. We came online in 1966. This is by far the largest expansion we have ever had. We must continue discovering new radioactive isotopes and helping industry partners commercialize them and get them to patients,” explained Matt Sandford, the executive director of the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR).\nThe $20 million three-story expansion will provide much-needed space for researchers at the MURR facility and increase opportunities for collaboration with industry partners.\n\"The people that work here are experts and respected worldwide for what they can do. And what the researchers need most right now is space to do the research, more experiments, and more partnerships to develop these technologies,” Sanford said.\nMURR focuses on research, medical isotope production, and advancing nuclear medicine.\n\"MURR is developing new radioisotopes for the latest cancer treatments, finding ways to ensure those isotopes can be delivered to specific cancer cells. And these technologies are changing how cancers are being treated, and we are saving lives daily,\" Sanford said.\nSanford says the facility's demand has increased due to recent regulation changes by the FDA allowing more drugs to use Lutetium 177, a radioactive isotope produced at MURR.\n“We are expanding those technologies to new research and production to those isotopes here at the University of Missouri,” Sanford said.\nWith \"MURR West\" now complete, Sanford hopes to bring some of the world's top experts in advancing nuclear medicine to Columbia.\n\"Now that this building is complete, they'll be interested in coming here and partnering with the experts at MURR and the University of Missouri to help bring their new technologies to life,\" Sanford said.\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2025 Sinclair, Inc.

    "title": "Best Altcoins to Invest in Right Now: Hunt for the Next Big Cryptocurrency",
    "text": "Amid the ever-changing landscape of digital currencies, the quest to discover the next breakout asset intensifies. Spotting an altcoin on the cusp of significant growth can be both exciting and rewarding. This article delves into emerging cryptocurrencies that show strong potential, guiding readers toward coins that may soon surge forward.\nDOGEN: The First Memetoken for Alpha Males Who Demand the Best Unleash your inner alpha with DOGEN, the meme token built for those who want to live a beautiful life. DOGEN is the alpha dog that never misses a chance to win big. This is the token for winners who won’t settle for anything less. Think luxury cars, stacks of cash, and beautiful women — that’s the Alpha DOGEN lifestyle!\nHODL Like a Boss, Conquer the Market Ready to live like an Alpha DOGEN and enjoy the finer things in life? It’s on the runway, gearing up for a 700% takeoff by the end of the presale — and that’s just the start. With DOGEN, you’re looking at potential thousand-fold returns as memetokens lead the hottest trend of this altcoin season.\nThe earlier you jump in, the more you win! It’s a deal that others will envy, and you’ll be at the top of the pack.\nMissed WIF, Popcat or Ponke rise? DOGEN is the new doggie on the Solana memetokens ground alongside BONK, WIF, and Popcat known for their astonishing 1000% growth. Currently undervalued, DOGEN is poised to take this crypto narrative to the next level, potentially breaking records in this bull run.\nCommunity-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a short-lived hype; it’s a growing movement. The team behind DOGEN is laser-focused on building a thriving community of alpha leaders who refuse to settle for less and are geared up to dominate the market.\nThis token offers real value, from exciting campaigns to exclusive perks for early adopters. DOGEN is an opportunity to be part of something that lasts.\nDOGEN’s multi-level referral program is as fierce as it gets: You’ll score 7% from every token your direct bros (1st level) buy using your referral code. Plus, there are more rewards down the line — you can grow your profits as your referrals bring in even more users.\nKaspa: A High-Speed Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency with GHOSTDAG Protocol Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa’s GHOSTDAG allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus. This results in a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG) rather than a chain.\nThis approach allows for secure operation with high block rates, currently at one block per second, with plans to increase to 10 per second or more.\nKaspa features tools like Reachability for querying the network’s structure, block data pruning, and SPV proofs. Future support for subnetworks aims to simplify the implementation of layer 2 solutions. Given its technological advancements, Kaspa may be an attractive option in the current market cycle.\nXRP: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency for Fast, Low-Cost Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed for fast and low-cost transactions. It operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, ensuring secure and irreversible exchanges. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for ecosystem development.\nRipple uses XRP to improve liquidity and support the network, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. The coin facilitates borderless payment transfers across various currencies without the need for a bank account. In the current market cycle, XRP’s focus on speed and efficiency may make it an attractive option for digital transactions.\nSolana and SOL Coin: Powering a Fast and Scalable Blockchain Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability, serving as a foundation for decentralized applications like those on Ethereum and Cardano. It focuses on processing transactions quickly without using sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers.\nSOL is the platform’s native cryptocurrency. It plays a key role in the ecosystem by enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network.\nThe SOL coin underpins the operation of Solana and gives users access to a variety of projects. Its technology’s potential lies in hosting high-activity products and services, attracting developers and users interested in a high-capacity network.\nToncoin: Native Cryptocurrency of The Open Network and Its Future Potential Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized layer-1 blockchain. Originally developed by Telegram as the ‘Gram’ token, the project became independent after Telegram ceased involvement in 2020 due to legal issues. The Open Network utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus model, aiming to enhance scalability and reliability.\nIt aspires to offer fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and to develop an ecosystem featuring decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Price predictions indicate potential growth in the coming years. Toncoin’s technological features and ecosystem development may make it attractive in the current market cycle.\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin.\nButerin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply significantly raised SHIB’s profile.\nUnlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for the development of applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These developments suggest potential for broader utility in the crypto space.\nConclusion While KAS, XRP, SOL, and TON show less short-term promise, DOGEN stands out for immediate gains. Designed for those seeking the best, DOGEN anticipates 700% growth by presale end, with potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season.\nEmulating successes like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram",

It’s a collective thing.’\nAl-Ettifaq face tenth-place Al-Khaleej before a challenging away match against league leaders Al-Hilal, with Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves on their books.",

    "title": "DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: What I do to help halt ageing and stay healthy... From flossing twice a day to keeping my home at a chilly 15c, how to reduce 'inflammaging' | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Not yet made your New Year's resolutions? Then you might consider doing something about your 'inflammage'. The term, a mash-up of inflammation and age, is causing growing interest among scientists as more and more research suggests that chronic inflammation is one of the main drivers of ageing and many of the diseases that come with it. While we all have some inflammation somewhere, and increasingly so as we age, keeping levels as low as possible will pay multiple dividends. Reducing it can slow your biological clock, allowing you to live a longer and healthier life, with a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes , arthritis and dementia. I'm fascinated by inflammaging, so much so that I recently interviewed Janet Lord, director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at Birmingham University. During the interview, which airs next Friday on Radio 4, she offered me her tips for reducing inflammaging, which I share below, alongside others I practise myself. As long as you're not frail, sick or elderly, it may be worth turning that thermostat down a couple of degrees SET AN ALARM TO MOVE One of the best ways to reduce inflammaging is to sit less (perhaps set an alarm to remind you to get up and stroll around at least once an hour) and become more active. A study by the University of California in 2017 found that a single session of moderately brisk walking was enough to make a difference. The researchers took blood from 47 volunteers before and after walking briskly on a treadmill for 20 minutes. This was enough to significantly reduce levels of a pro-inflammatory chemical called TNF (tumour necrosis factor) which plays an important role in your immune defences, but can also trigger chronic inflammation. FOLLOW A 'MIND' DIET The Mediterranean diet, which is rich in oily fish, nuts, olive oil, fruits, vegetables and legumes, is famously anti-inflammatory. Why? Many of the benefits seem to come from the impact it has on our gut bacteria. In a study published in the journal Gut in 2020, researchers asked more than 600 people (aged 65 plus) to stick to their normal diet or try a Mediterranean-style diet. Regular tooth brushing and flossing reduces the chance of developing gingivitis, inflammation of the gums, caused by a build-up of plaque between your teeth A year later, the people who had changed their diets not only showed signs of improved brain function, such as better memory, but they had lots more 'good' bacteria in their guts, the sort that produce anti-inflammatory chemicals, called short-chain fatty acids, which have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease. Another more recent study, published in the journal Neurology last year, found that people who follow the so-called MIND diet (which is like the Mediterranean diet, but with a greater emphasis on eating berries and leafy green veg, such as spinach and kale) had brains that were judged to be 12 years younger than those who didn't. We don't know exactly why, but it may be that components of the MIND diet (such as omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and polyphenols) reduce inflammation in the brain. So add another portion of greens to your meals and some berries to your yoghurt. LOWER THERMOSTAT Over recent months (with my wife Clare's reluctant co-operation), I've kept the thermostats in our house at a fairly chilly 15c. Not only does this save money, but there is evidence that keeping the room temperature down causes your body to produce more brown fat. Unlike normal fat, brown fat burns lots of calories (to keep you warm) and it produces a chemical called maresin-2 which helps reduce chronic inflammation. There is evidence that keeping the room temperature down causes your body to produce more brown fat. Unlike normal fat, brown fat burns lots of calories As long as you're not frail, sick or elderly, it may be worth turning that thermostat down a couple of degrees. FLOSS TWICE A DAY Regular tooth brushing and flossing reduces the chance of developing gingivitis, inflammation of the gums, caused by a build-up of plaque between your teeth — which not only increases your chance of losing your teeth, but is linked to chronic inflammation elsewhere. That's because bacteria in the plaque can travel in the bloodstream to other parts of the body, even to the brain. A study by Birmingham University in 2021 found that having advanced gum disease increased the risk of developing mental ill-health by 37 per cent, heart disease by 18 per cent and type 2 diabetes by 26 per cent. Researchers are working on various options to combat gingivitis, and therefore chronic inflammation, including the use of oral microbial transplants. The idea, which is currently being pursued by researchers in Australia, is that you load a mouthguard with healthy bugs which you put in your mouth and which then do battle with the acid-producing ones that currently colonise your teeth. That's some way off, but in the meantime, if you don't floss, start now. And floss first, then brush — the flossing dislodges the plaque, which the brushing then sweeps away. LIMIT MEALTIMES Cutting calories leads to a longer, healthier life — or so studies show — and one of the ways that it does so is by reducing chronic inflammation. That was the conclusion of a U.S. study published in the journal Aging in 2016. For this study, 220 brave volunteers were randomly allocated to either continue as normal or cut their daily calorie intake by 25 per cent for two years. That's quite an undertaking and not all of those asked to cut their calories — some, but not all, of whom were overweight — managed to stick to such a draconian diet. Those that did saw a big reduction in inflammatory markers, such as TNF (mentioned earlier). The good news is the researchers don't think you need to go that far to see benefits; cutting your daily calorie intake by 10-15 per cent, which for the average person might mean cutting out 200-300 calories (i.e. a small bar of chocolate), is enough. Or you might prefer following an intermittent fasting diet, such as the 5:2 diet (where you cut your calories two days a week) or time-restricted eating, where you eat within a time window. A recent study shows intermittent fasting reduces levels of pro-inflammatory cells called monocytes in the blood. BREATHE AWAY STRESS Short bursts of stress are manageable, but chronic stress leads to high levels of inflammation. Some of the best ways to reduce chronic stress include being more active and eating a healthy diet, but on top of that I'd recommend practising slow, deep breathing, which slows down your heart rate and makes you feel calmer. There are lots of different ways you can do this, but my go-to breathing exercise is 4:2:4. I breathe in through my nose to a count of four, hold my breath to a count of two, then breathe out of my mouth to a count of four. A couple of minutes are enough to reduce my stress levels and put me to sleep, if I happen to be awake in the middle of the night. Daydreaming? It is good for your brain Ever since I was a child, I have been a real daydreamer. I can be on the sofa, getting ready to empty the bins, which I have promised to do, when my mind wanders off and I start thinking about something else entirely. As you can imagine, this irritates my wife. Fortunately I can now point to research which shows that, far from being a waste of time, daydreaming may be good for my mental health. This is based on a recent study, published in the journal Nature, by researchers at Harvard Medical School in the U.S. They showed a group of mice black and white images, while monitoring brain activity. The mice were then left alone for a bit of down-time. While that was happening, bits of their brain would occasionally light up in distinctive patterns, as if they were mentally revisiting those black and white images. At the same time, there was increased activity in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is responsible for storing memories. If the same is true of humans, then this suggests that when we are apparently doing nothing and daydreaming, our brains are in fact still hard at work, making new neural connections and existing memories stronger. And that in turn suggests it's important for our brain health to make space in our day for more daydreams. So put your feet up, phone aside and start staring into space. Who knows what great ideas your brain will come up with? One of the odd things I noticed when I went to the sales recently to buy new shoes, is that my feet seem to have got half a size bigger. Apparently, this is common. As you get older your feet can get wider because, as you age, the ligaments and tendons that support your arches lose some elasticity, so your foot can spread out. This is partly a product of wear and tear (by the time you reach my age you have probably taken around 190 million steps) and partly because any increased weight in middle age adds to the downward pressure on your feet. If you have foot pain, or if your shoes are more worn on one side than the other, then it could be a sign you need arch support — and it may be time to invest in some insoles.",

    "text": "Mombasa Port posted a record of 1.6 million containers this year compared to last year’s 1.4 million containers. The growth has been attributed to improved efficiency at the facility, dispelling claims that [Dar es Salaam port](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/shipping-logistics/article/2001486838/dar-djibouti-choke-with-congestion-as-mombasa-port-comes-to-the-rescue) was attracting more ships than Kenya’s main port. Statistics released by [Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/business/article/2001486470/kpa-charts-ambitious-course-sees-profits-hitting-sh20b-in-five-years) shows that containers handled at Mombasa port this year rose to 1.6 million twenty-foot equivalent units (Teus) compared to last year’s 1,449 million Teus. The port handled 1.43 million Teus in 2021, indicating that Mombasa Port remains the most efficient port on the East Coast of Africa. KPA Managing Director William Ruto said container traffic grew more this year than in other years owing to improved efficiency at the facility. A clearing agent Mr Clement Ngala concurred with Captain Ruto, noting that Mombasa port has been attracting more port users despite the challenges from shipping lines. “Mombasa port is efficient and has the capacity to handle more ships unlike Dar Es Salaam which has a problem of inefficiency and lack of capacity to handle many ships at a go,” said Ngala. Ngala maintained that foreign shipping lines have been the problem at Mombasa port and distanced the port from any blame. “We have a problem with what foreign shipping lines are charging at Mombasa port,” said Ngala who noted that some laws should be enacted to shield importers from high tariffs. “Mombasa port tariffs are fair and that is why we are not complaining against it.” Captain Ruto said even transshipment traffic had increased from 121,577 Teus in 2018 to 210,170 Teus in 2022 and is also expected to grow higher in the coming days. He lauded increased export of Kenyan commodities - terming it a breakthrough as it would improve the country’s [foreign earnings](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/financial-standard/article/2001487509/tourism-new-frontier-in-nairobi-and-dar-sibling-rivalry-in-2024) and the economy. Among the leading exports include avocado, coffee, tea, vegetables, cashew nuts, fish fillets, and other foodstuffs and beverages. Mv Marathopolis which docked in Mombasa with electronic appliances and other assorted goods on December 18 discharged 2954 containers within two days and sailed away with 2269 containers of export cargo. The ship also discharged 200 empty containers, 155 containers with goods in transit and loaded 207 empty containers before sailing away. During the short stay in the port, Mv Marathopolis also loaded 549 empty containers on transit and 12 containers with export goods on transit. He says following efficiency at the port, there has been a steady increase in the number of containers being handled at the port for the last three years. Over the last five years, cargo throughput grew by 2.3 per cent from 30.9 million tones in 2018 to 33.9 million tones in 2022 and we expect it to grow higher in 2023. In 2021 the port handled 1.435 million Teus, which increased to 1.449 million Teus in 2022 while this year, the figure has shot to a record 1.6 million Teus. He attributed the performance to efficiency resulting in improved turnaround of the ships from three days to two days - reducing the dwell time for containers to three days, from four days. Statistics released by KPA show that most of the ships that docked in Mombasa port offloaded their cargo and sailed away in a record time. Among the ships that docked at the port between December 16 and 29 is Mv As Nora which discharged 900 containers and sailed away with 830 containers. Other ships that discharged containerised cargo at the port are MV CMA CGM Gulf Express, MSC Partnaree, MV MSC Meltemi 111, MV Cesius New Oreleans and MV Jolly Roro among others. According to the 14-day list, ships that have arrived and are waiting to load include Mv Lss Success waiting to load 4000 live animals for export.",

They are gifts to humanity, and many of us could not consider life without them, but they can also lower a curtain of sameness over food when deployed repetitively, and that’s most definitely a thing at this puffed-up Desert Ridge offering from the owner of Sizzle and ShinBay. Among the 30 or so noodle, soup and entrée selections on the Chinese-Korean menu, La-Jo-Gi chicken ($38) has one of the more interesting elevator pitches (“Korean-style Sichuan chicken”), but neither of those Asian styles coherently emerges from the sweet-garlicky-salty stir-fry glaze. There might be a touch of gochujang in there, but the server doesn’t know, and it basically tastes like slightly elevated P.F. Chang’s. The same could be said for the Classic Chile Garlic Shrimp ($37) – chiles? If you say so – and even the Seafood Medley Pot ($87), which doesn’t eat like the splurge it’s priced to be. Resting in a leek-infused oyster sauce, the lobster, scallops, king crab and calamari all have a meager, overcooked mien to them, though I do later slurp up the leek sauce.\nJin Jia isn’t bad – in fact, it’s the kind of scrubbed, repeatable experience that’s great for big groups. But it’s also a typical mall restaurant, and it might be in denial about that.\nWild Card: Skip the over-sweet, overpriced Shanghai (read: whiskey) sour ($18); order the supple steamed dumplings ($15).\n21001 N.
