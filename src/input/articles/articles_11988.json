    "title": "Understanding PTSD and why our brains hold onto trauma",
    "text": "When a person has a traumatic or very stressful experience, the body responds by cascading a series of internal events to trigger the fight-or-flight response.\nThis response can be quite helpful in the moment, as it can lead to actions that promote survival. When this happens, a part of the brain called the amygdala is activated, which aids in processing emotion and memory.\nThe nervous system is wired to help people learn from stressful events to protect themselves. Oftentimes, this can be useful. For example, if a person is allergic to wasps, this process will alert the person that danger is near when a wasp is present based on a past reaction to a sting. This can save a person’s life.\nHowever, there are instances when individuals experience life-threatening events, and this reaction can become prolonged or intensified. Though the intent of the fight-or-flight response is to help individuals, a stronger reaction can emerge even when there is no danger present. This can develop into Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD. Signs of PTSD include symptoms associated with intrusive thoughts (e.g. flashbacks, memories, nightmares), avoidance (e.g. of people, places, things, emotions, reminders of the event), increased reactivity (e.g. hypervigilance, easily startled, easily angered, sleep disturbances), and negative changes in thoughts and emotions (e.g. guilt, shame, personal blame, feeling worthless, losing interest in hobbies, memory difficulties, withdrawing from others). Though these symptoms may naturally arise in those who experience stressful events, if they last longer than a month, they may have escalated to PTSD.\nAnyone can develop PTSD. At any given time, about 5% of adults in the U.S. meet its criteria. Some groups who tend to experience PTSD at higher rates than the average population are women, veterans, first responders and victims of sexual assault.\nThe stress response is a normal part of human functioning and survival, but the development of PTSD can significantly impact quality of life. There are a variety of therapies available for the treatment of PTSD, including Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD), to name a few. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is a leader in PTSD research and treatment.

    "text": "FC Barcelona\nEl semáforo del Mónaco-Barça: Lamine es de otro planeta\nLo mejor y lo peor del partido entre el Mónaco y el Barça de la primera jornada de la Liga de Campeones\nDespués de ganar todos los partidos de las cinco primeras jornadas del campeonato liguero, el objetivo es trasladar el buen juego y los resultados positivos a Europa. La última Champions ganada por el Barça es de la temporada 2014-15 y con Flick el barcelonismo se ha ganado el derecho a volver a soñar con algo grande en esta competición. La derrota en Mónaco es un duro golpe para empezar.\nLamine Yamal es el mejor del mundo\nIncreíble. Alucinante. Es el nuevo genio del Barça. Cuando más sufría el equipo apareció el mejor futbolista del planeta. Golazo bestial de un elegido, de un escogido. Es una aparición que no tiene parangón. El de Rocafonda ya es después de Ansu el goleador más joven de la historia de la Champions. La Masia es otra historia. El talento de Lamine Yamal Nasraoui es mayúsculo. Messi es único pero este chico es lo que más se parece a Leo. El pase a Raphinha en el minuto 51 es una maravilla.\nDudar de Casadó es un pecado\nPrimero fue Marc Bernal y ahora Marc Casadó. ¿Qué más se necesita para que nos olvidemos de pedir un pivote extranjero y se crea que los mediocentros de La Masia son la repera? El de Sant Pere de Vilamajor está completando un partidazo. Corre, lucha, trabaja y está siempre bien colocado y es una ayuda constante.\nJugar con uno menos\nEl Barça está sufriendo porque competir con 10 en un partido de esta dificultad es muy difícil. Los arbitrajes europeos del Barça son para reflexionar. El equipo necesita rehacerse para superar este momento. El equipo ha sabido competir en la segunda mitad pero el Mónaco ha encontrado el gol en una jugada muy aislada.\nPellegrini detecta el problema de Vitor Roque Flick tenía razón con Iñigo Martínez Alerta máxima con Pau Cubarsí Esta es la convocatoria del Barça para Monaco Toni-Guille, dos primos andan sueltos por Europa El golpe que planea el Madrid para el próximo verano La revolución de Flick llega a Europa Barça y Nike siguen avanzando",

    "title": "The Role of AI in Fraud Detection and Digital Payment Security",
    "text": "With the rapid growth of digital transactions, fraud and cyberattacks have become increasingly prevalent, necessitating more sophisticated methods to protect sensitive data. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game-changer in this realm, offering innovative ways to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. From identifying suspicious behavior to securing digital payment systems, AI is transforming the landscape of financial security. While AI is at the forefront of these advancements, it works in tandem with other technologies, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), to further enhance online privacy and security.\nAd\nIn today’s digital world, maintaining privacy and security during online transactions is more important than ever. While AI has become a critical tool in fraud detection and digital payment security, VPNs also play an essential role in safeguarding personal and financial data from cyber threats. A VPN encrypts internet traffic, creating a secure tunnel that prevents hackers from intercepting sensitive information. As AI technology advances, its integration with VPN systems becomes an even more powerful security measure for online transactions.\nUnderstanding AI-Powered Fraud Detection Systems\nThe rise in online transactions has brought about a parallel increase in the risk of fraud. In response, AI-powered fraud detection systems have been developed to help identify and prevent fraudulent activities in real time. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, these systems can analyze large volumes of transaction data and detect unusual patterns or behaviors that may signal fraudulent activity. Machine learning enables these systems to continuously improve their detection capabilities by learning from new data, thus staying ahead of potential fraudsters.\nThese AI-driven systems are particularly valuable in digital payments, where they can swiftly identify and block fraudulent transactions before they affect customers or businesses. By examining transaction histories, AI can flag abnormal behavior, such as large or multiple small payments made from an unfamiliar location, or transactions made with stolen card information. This real-time threat detection is crucial for maintaining secure digital payment systems.\nHow AI Transforms Digital Payment Security\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing digital payment security by making it smarter, faster, and more proactive. The technology enables payment providers to assess the risk level of each transaction based on data patterns and anomalies. AI doesn’t just react to threats, it anticipates them, learning from past data and constantly refining its ability to predict and prevent fraud.\nIn the realm of digital payments, AI enhances security by providing a thorough, data-driven analysis of every transaction. This is critical because fraudsters are becoming increasingly sophisticated, using new tactics to bypass traditional security measures. AI’s ability to analyze vast amounts of data from multiple sources allows it to recognize subtle indicators of fraud that human operators might miss. As a result, AI significantly reduces the risks of cyberattacks and enhances the overall security of digital payments.\nAdditionally, AI systems are capable of learning from real-time data, which helps them predict future fraud patterns. This forward-thinking capability makes AI an invaluable tool for digital payment providers in combating emerging threats, ensuring both businesses and consumers can confidently engage in online transactions.\nThe Integration of AI and VPN for Enhanced Security\nTo fully protect online transactions, integrating AI with VPN technology offers a robust security solution. A VPN encrypts a user’s internet connection, ensuring that sensitive data, such as credit card information or login credentials, is transmitted securely. Without encryption, data can be intercepted by hackers, especially when using public or unsecured networks. This is where the synergy between AI and VPN technology becomes essential.\nAd\nAI can help identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in digital payment systems, while a VPN secures the actual transmission of sensitive information across the internet. By combining these technologies, businesses can provide a multi-layered approach to fraud detection and online security. Planet VPN offer the protection of a secure, encrypted connection, and AI detects and prevents threats by analyzing transaction data in real time. This powerful combination ensures the safety and privacy of online transactions, even as cyber threats grow more sophisticated.\nWhile AI addresses the predictive and reactive aspects of security, VPNs safeguard the data’s journey across the internet. Together, they create a fortified system that protects sensitive financial information from fraud and cyberattacks.\nThe Future of AI in Financial Security\nAs digital payments continue to dominate, AI’s role in financial security will only grow more crucial. Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly adept at identifying fraud in a fraction of the time it would take traditional systems to process. By analyzing large datasets, AI can predict and prevent fraud before it happens, reducing the number of false positives that are common with older systems. This will streamline transaction processing, making it easier for businesses and consumers to conduct secure payments.\nOne of the most promising applications of AI in financial security is predictive fraud prevention. Through the use of machine learning, AI systems can identify trends and patterns in customer behavior that could indicate future fraudulent activities. This predictive capability allows businesses to implement preventative measures, stopping fraud before it even occurs. This approach minimizes financial losses and enhances customer trust, both of which are critical for maintaining a competitive edge in the digital economy.\nEmerging Trends in Financial Security: Blockchain and AI\nAnother trend that’s gaining traction in financial security is the integration of blockchain technology with AI. Blockchain provides a transparent, immutable ledger for transactions, while AI enhances its ability to detect fraudulent activities in real time. Combining these technologies creates an even more secure and efficient system for digital payments. Blockchain’s decentralized nature reduces the risk of fraud, while AI’s real-time analysis ensures that any suspicious activity is flagged and prevented instantly.\nThe synergy between blockchain and AI has the potential to revolutionize digital payment security, offering both transparency and security. As blockchain and AI technologies continue to evolve, they will reshape the way financial institutions approach fraud detection and payment security, creating an environment where digital payments are not only convenient but also incredibly secure.\nStrengthening Online Privacy with VPN Technology\nWhile AI and blockchain work to secure transactions and detect fraud, the role of VPN technology in enhancing online privacy cannot be understated. A VPN provides a secure internet connection, shielding personal and financial information from cyber threats. When conducting digital transactions, using a VPN ensures that data is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to intercept.\nAd\nIn addition to securing digital payments, VPNs offer privacy protection, which is crucial in today’s data-driven world. By masking a user’s IP address, a VPN prevents third parties from tracking online activities and collecting personal information. This is particularly important for individuals who engage in financial transactions or access sensitive accounts over public or unsecured networks. In combination with AI-powered security measures, VPNs play an essential role in protecting digital privacy and safeguarding online financial activities.\nConclusion: The Future of Digital Payment Security\nThe future of digital payment security lies in the integration of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and VPNs. AI’s ability to detect and prevent fraud in real-time, combined with the encryption and privacy protection offered by VPNs, ensures that online transactions are safe, secure, and efficient. As the digital economy continues to evolve, these technologies will become even more crucial in protecting consumers and businesses alike from the growing threat of cybercrime.\nBy leveraging AI to predict and prevent fraud and VPNs to secure data, businesses can create a more robust and secure payment environment for their customers. As digital payments continue to increase, staying ahead of cybersecurity threats through the implementation of AI and VPN technology will be essential to maintaining the integrity of online transactions and ensuring the future of secure digital commerce.",

    "title": "First Alert: Freezing rain threat Friday night into Saturday with tough travel",
    "text": "First Alert: Freezing rain threat Friday night into Saturday with tough travel\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - An icy mess is probable for much of eastern Iowa to kick off the weekend.\nYour First Alert: Winter Weather Advisory in effect Friday night\nThe rest of your Thursday evening is quiet, aside from a few leftover flurries early on. No travel trouble will come from this, and winds will remain on the light side. A gradual diminishing of the cloud cover we have is likely later on, and temperatures will be in the single digits above zero. Wind chills will stay below zero through mid-morning.\nThat partial clearing is short-lived, however, with new clouds moving in from the southwest. This is the first sign of our incoming storm system, though it’s well out ahead of its impacts. Instead, we’ll face a mostly cloudy sky during the day, as temperatures gradually warm throughout. Highs will be in the mid 20s, likely reached toward the end of the day.\nA Winter Weather Advisory goes into effect later on Friday evening into Saturday morning. This is for the area that is most likely to see ice accumulation from freezing rain and freezing drizzle.\nThe atmosphere will be working to overcome a bit of dry air initially, but should be able to do so by late in the evening. Precipitation will fall in a warm layer of the atmosphere above the ground, staying liquid until it reaches a shallow near-surface layer of air. When it hits any surface, it freezes on contact and begins to accumulate as ice.\nThis freezing rain will be the prominent precipitation type for the first several hours of this system, potentially mixing with a bit of snow at times. This could begin as early as about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., but the chance really begins to increase after Midnight into the overnight hours.\nEasterly winds, at about 10 to 20 mph, will stave off additional warming that could end the freezing rain threat earlier. As a result, ice accumulation of as much as a couple of a tenths of an inch is possible for parts of the TV9 viewing area. The most likely area to see this would be between about Interstate 80 and U.S. Highway 20.\nEnough warm air begins to move into the state to move the line between an icy mess and just plain rain northward during the daylight hours of Saturday. This process will take some time, and the exact timing of that changeover will be tricky to nail down exactly. Many areas south of Highway 20 will see some improvement by about Noon, with others north of there holding onto the wintry mix into the afternoon.\nPrecipitation lingers into Saturday, though most of us will be seeing just rain at that stage. Only the far north could be hanging onto some of that snow mixing in. Because of the potential for snow to stick around longer, it’s our northern zones that could see some light snow accumulation. This further adds to the potential travel trouble.\nHow you should react to this storm system\nThe biggest hazard with freezing rain is the impact on travel, whether walking or in a vehicle. Avoid both, if possible, when icy conditions are present.\nIf you must drive, slow down! Give plenty of room between you and the vehicle in front of you. Avoid sudden braking or sharp turns which could cause you to lose traction. Approach intersections with extra caution. Pack [a winter survival kit](https://www.weather.gov/media/dmx/Preparedness/CarWinterSurvivalKitChecklist.pdf) if you drive away from populated areas.\nIf you head out on foot, pay especially close attention to untreated paved surfaces, including sidewalks and parking lots. These can be slicker than they appear. Use a railing for balance if available, or consider walking in the grass where the plant life provides some additional traction. Wear appropriate footwear to help decrease the chance of a fall.\nWe also recommend the [KCRG-TV9 First Alert Weather App](https://www.kcrg.com/page/download-our-app/), which can give you customized alerts for your location, as well as road conditions available from a button on the home screen of the app. Of course, we’ll also provide updates on KCRG.com and KCRG-TV9 as conditions warrant.\nGenerally quieter with a few precipitation chances\nAfter this storm system exits the region, warmer air will continue to move in. This pushes our highs pretty decently above normal by Sunday into Monday, with lows in the 30s and highs in the low to mid 40s for most. Clouds will remain common, however.\nAnother disturbance brings a shot at some showers late on Sunday night into Monday. Our air should be warm enough to avoid any icy issues with this round, and the heaviest precipitation will fall to the east and southeast of the viewing area.\nAnother break is likely on Tuesday as cooler air makes a return. The downward trend in temperatures continues for the remainder of the 9-day. Most of us will experience lows in the 10s and 20s, with highs in the upper 20s to mid 30s, during this stretch of time.\nA storm system could bring a shot at some snow by the middle of the week on Wednesday. This outcome isn’t fully certain, however, with some significant differences among the computer models we use to help make our forecasts on the timing and path of the system. We’ll keep a close eye on it and bring you the latest as we know it.\nCopyright 2024 KCRG. All rights reserved.",

Deux défenseurs du [« suicide assisté »](https://www.20minutes.fr/sante/4080683-20240311-fin-vie-euthanasie-suicide-assiste-sedation-aide-mourir-differences) soupçonnés d’avoir remis des médicaments à une nonagénaire ont été placés en garde à vue à [Grenoble](https://www.20minutes.fr/grenoble/), a indiqué le parquet ce jeudi. Mercredi, vers 19h30, à Grenoble, « les policiers ont été contactés par le fils d’une personne âgée de 91 ans, signalant qu’un couple présent dans le logement avait voulu tuer sa mère » a indiqué le procureur de Grenoble Eric Vaillant. Les deux militants, un homme et une femme de 81 ans, sont soupçonnés d’avoir « remis des médicaments » à la mère du requérant, qui « les a ingurgités avant de les vomir », selon cette même source. Ils ont été placés en garde à vue pour « exercice illégal de la profession de pharmacien » et « propagande en faveur de produits préconisés comme moyens d’aide au suicide », selon le parquet. Le suicide assisté est illégal, tout comme l’euthanasie Sur son site, l’association Ultime liberté indique militer « pour la liberté de choisir le moment, le lieu et les modalités de sa mort » et l’inscription dans la loi du suicide assisté « lorsque l’intéressé se trouve dans un état où il ne peut plus communiquer et qu’il a écrit ses directives anticipées ». La loi n’autorise actuellement ni suicide assisté ni euthanasie. Un projet de loi sur la fin de vie, qui devrait ouvrir la possibilité strictement encadrée d’une assistance au suicide, avait commencé à être débattu par les députés au printemps, mais la dissolution a plongé le texte dans l’incertitude.

    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. ( KKTV /Gray News) - A retired Marine and cancer survivor in Colorado celebrates the anniversary of his remission with a feat he picked up during his service.\nMichael LaBarge said he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV brain cancer, 21 years ago on April 2.\nLaBarge said he has been in remission for a while and that he swims for 10 hours on the anniversary to celebrate it.\n“The prognosis was two weeks to 10 months … 21 years ago,” he told KKTV . “I did this a lot in the Marines. [Today,] I started at 6 a.m., stopping at 4 p.m.”\nHe completed his swim this year at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Community Pool in Colorado Springs.\nChris Gesterling, the USAFA Pool Aquatics Manager, said he often sees LaBarge at the pool, and his story of surviving cancer is inspiring.\n“Former Marine ... you know, he beat brain cancer so everything is possible for him,” Gesterling said.\nAs LaBarge swam, he also shared his message for those fighting similar battles to the one he faced.\n“Hopefully, this will inspire people with cancer to get out, stay active and, you know, don’t get too down on themselves,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 KKTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.
