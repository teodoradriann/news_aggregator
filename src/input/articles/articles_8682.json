    "text": "Les Québécois n’ont pas fini de suer alors qu’un épisode de chaleur d’une durée « exceptionnelle » s’abat sur le sud de la province, poussant Environnement Canada à émettre des avertissements de chaleur dans plusieurs régions. • À lire aussi: Le mois de juillet marqué par plusieurs phénomènes météorologiques « C’est un évènement plutôt rare, affirme Julie Deshaie, météorologue d’Environnement Canada. Pour voir un épisode équivalent, il faut remonter loin. » Au début du mois d’août 2001, une vague de chaleur s’est abattue sur le Québec pendant 10 longues journées. Si on remonte plus loin, une canicule comparable a duré 8 jours en 1970. Bien en place depuis dimanche dernier, la chaleur et l’humidité doivent « perdurer jusqu’à dimanche prochain ». La durée de l’épisode de 2001 ne sera donc pas dépassée. Les précipitations sur certaines régions du Québec mercredi ajoutent au « caractère particulier » de l’épisode de chaleur actuel. Vendredi et samedi, l’humidex – qui définit la température ressentie – sera maintenu au-dessus de 35. Dimanche, il atteindra « 35, 36 degrés » et sera accompagné d’averses et d’orages. La température doit redescendre lundi dans les moyennes de saisons, c’est-à-dire autour de la mi-vingtaine de degrés. Des avertissements de chaleur en vigueur Environnement Canada a émis des avertissements de chaleur pour une région du Québec s’étalant du Pontiac, allant jusqu’à la Haute-Gatineau, touchant les Laurentides jusqu’à Lachute. Cette région s’allonge tout au long du Saint-Laurent jusqu’à Québec et inclut la Montérégie et bien sûr Montréal. L’est-Ontarien est aussi affecté par la chaleur et l’humidité élevée. « Il peut y avoir des inconforts chez les gens », particulièrement « chez les personnes plus vulnérables », avertit Mme Deshaie. « Les risques pour la santé sont plus grands pour les personnes âgées, les nourrissons et les jeunes enfants, les personnes enceintes, les personnes souffrantes de maladies physiques ou mentales, et celles ayant un handicap ou des problèmes de mobilité » peut-on lire sous l’avertissement de chaleur d’Environnement Canada. On y recommande de bien s’hydrater « avant même de ressentir la soif » et de « vérifier plusieurs fois par jour l’état des personnes âgées ». Il est aussi indiqué de ne pas laisser de personnes, d’enfants ou d’animaux dans des véhicules stationnés.",

    "text": "Owner arrested after several horses found emaciated, 1 dead\nA Palm Beach County woman is facing animal cruelty charges after several of her horses were found extremely underweight, and one died.\nPamela Howell Beres was booked in the Palm Beach County jail following a more than year-long investigation where officials rescued six horses and a pony from her care.\nBeres has been charged with seven counts of felony animal cruelty and seven counts of unlawful abandonment or confinement of animal.\nThe investigation began in February of 2024, when, according to the probable cause statement, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office was notified by Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control of several underweight horses at a property in rural West Palm Beach.\nAn attending veterinarian at the property told officials he was called to the property for a severely emaciated horse lying in a stall. He met with the owner of the horse, Beres, and noted the horse was extremely underweight and had injuries to its head, likely from thrashing into the walls while trying to get up.\nThe veterinarian also reported the horse had pale gums and it was in some degree of shock. He said the overall prognosis was very poor and he alerted Beres that the horse would most likely not make it through the night.\nAccording to court records, the veterinarian suggested euthanasia, and Beres responded by yelling, “This horse is living and it will live because I say it will.\"\nSoon after, the veterinarian claims he witnessed Beres sit next to the horse and open its eyes. That's when the man said he watched as she began licking the horse's eyes with her tongue and mouth. The veterinarian said, \"She licked away the mucous and spit it out in the stall then continued.\"\nAccording to the probable cause statement, the horse was given steroids to make it comfortable.\nRoughly a week later, when a complaint was filed, a PBCSO deputy arrived at the property to observe the horses from a distance.\nAccording to court records, the deputy said he saw several horses who were in various stages of emaciation.\n\"Two brown horses appeared emaciated, with their ribs, hip bones, and spine prominent. Two white horses also were emaciated looking with their ribs, hip bones, and spine prominent. There was another darker brown horse which was clearly in poor condition, with its hips bones visible. My vantage point was approximately 100-200 feet away, and I could clearly see the bones protruding from the horses,\" the deputy reported.\nThe deputy said it was clear the horses were not being fed or provided adequate water and therefore had become so emaciated that, without proper care, the horses on the property would have become sicker or possibly died.\nThe PBCSO obtained a search warrant for the property and showed up the next day.\nAccording to the probable cause statement, the search revealed six horses and one pony found on the property.\nInvestigators said none of the horses had access to grain or fresh water and there were only remnants of hay in some of the paddocks.\n\"All of the horses were underweight in various degrees, ranging from emaciated to severely thin. The pony was moderately underweight,\" the deputy said.\nWhile they did find food in the barn, officials said if any food was provided to the horses, it was apparent that it was not provided in amounts sufficient to sustain the horses and pony.\nAccording to court records, officials found it was evident from the condition of the horses that the very basic care and nutritional needs were not being met, causing their physical condition to deteriorate.\nSoon after they arrived at the property, deputies learned that the horse seen by the vet on February 23, 2024, had died.\nThe six surviving horses and pony were seized and taken to Palm Beach County Animal\nCare and Control to be examined by a veterinarian.\nAccording to the probable cause statement, the veterinarian at PBCACC provided the care and treatment regimen for the horses and pony. The doctor noted, \"All of the horses on the day of seizure were severely malnourished. The pony was slightly thin. Some of the horses were on the verge of starvation with body scores of one or slightly above.\"\nAfter being given proper nutrients and receiving both medical and dental care, investigators said the horses gained weight and showed improvement within three months of proper care.\nHorses are cleared for rescue\nOnce the animals were deemed healthy and cleared to be released to a rescue facility, six of the horses were picked up by Grune Heidi Farm Rescue in Polk County.\nThe president of the rescue, Erika Gilbert, said they specialize in Arabian and American Saddlebred horses\n\"So these horses are all pedigree horses, they're all registered, and what our rescue does is we go the extra mile to reunite those horses with their heritage and their pedigree,\" Gilbert said.\nUsing DNA, she found each horse was registered and could be matched to their pedigrees.\n\"So these horses were all Egyptian Arabians, and I could tell their pedigrees, and I found out where they came from. Many of them were bred from a farm in Ohio, and that Pamela purchased them from,\" she said.\nWith all the information she was able to gather on them, she was able to reunite one of the horses with their breeder.\n\"One of the horses that was rescued went back to the original breeder, and they were happy to have her back. So that's what we do,\" she added. \"We go the extra mile to reunite those horses with their birth certificate.\"\nGilbert said she started researching Beres and learned she was once well-known in the equine community.\n\"With these types of horses, they assume that these horses are worth a lot of money. Like 'Oh, they're going to be making me tons of money' and instead of letting them go to a good home, or just giving them away to someone that can feed them and take care of them, they want money,\" Gilbert said.\nShe said from talking with others in the equine community, she suspects that's what Beres was doing.\n\"She was willing to sell them to people. You know, oh, I want $8,000 for that horse, or I want $10,000 for that horse, and she's totally blinded by what they look like, because she's focusing on their pedigrees,\" she told WPBF.\nShe said this specific breed of horses can be very empathetic and bonds with their owners.\n\"These horses have such a strong bond with their people. It's inherited in them. It's ingrained. They make great family horses. They're just, they love their people, and they're very versatile. They bond with no other, and they have a beauty unlike any other,\" Gilbert said.\nGilbert said, unfortunately, rescues of all kinds are struggling to meet the demand.\n\"Rescues are highly needed, and we're tired. We're tired. We've taken a lot of horses, and I'm just not speaking about horses, but all animal rescues, we're all tired,\" she said.\nShe said rescues need the community's help to combat the growing problem of overbreeding.\n\"Just stop the backyard breeding. Just do your research if you are breeding. These horses, they're a lifetime commitment. They're not just cats and dogs who live only maybe 15, 16, 20 years tops. You have horses that live 30 years, 30-plus years. It is a lifetime commitment and they cost a lot of money,\" she said.\nGilbert encourages those struggling with costs and the work to reach out for help.\n\"If you've taken a horse and you need help, reach out to a rescue and ask for help. A lot of rescues, not just our rescue, but many rescues, offer help with feed or offer help with hay for owners that are down on their luck or have financial problems in the short term. We do supply feed and hay. We also can take in a horse for medical needs,\" she added.\nAll six horses have now found forever homes.\nThe smallest of the group making a big impact\nThe smallest of the animals rescued was a pony who has since been named Freya. Claudia Campbell, who runs Delmar Farm, a nonprofit sanctuary, learned a pony was at PBCACC and couldn't resist.\n\"The minute we learned about her, we went over and picked her up and brought her home,\" Campbell said.\nShe said when they first brought her home, they put her in an area with other ponies until Campbell realized that's not what Freya wanted.\n\"Eventually, we ended up putting her in this group behind me, and she was so much happier getting to be around the larger horses. So I just found it to be so sad that the other horses were taken away from her, and she was left all by herself. So she was really happy to come here,\" she said.\nThe farm sanctuary offers different programs and recently introduced a free program they've titled 'Stable Moments'. The program is a one-on-one mentorship program for children in foster and adoptive homes. The sanctuary pairs one child with one mentor and one horse every week for one hour.\n\"So we have a little girl that we paired Freya up with that was like the perfect match because their personality is really aligned. I told a little girl that this pony could probably use some help with her training and her mannerism, and it just it made such a difference in this little girl's personality. So it worked out really great and Freya now is a little therapy pony,\" she told WPBF.\nCampbell said they don't see many horse abuse cases originating in Florida, but they do take in a wide variety of animals.\n\"It's a lot. We do have a great team of volunteers, but it's constant. With water and feed and cleaning and everything, it's a huge undertaking. The overhead is astronomical,\" she said.\nBeing a non-profit, the sanctuary runs on donations, volunteers and sponsors.\n\"We're hoping to get more sponsors because that program [Stable Moments] we're doing for free. So we hope to get more help with that so we can help more children with our animals,\" she said.\nSimilar to what Gilbert said, Campbell explained how owning a horse is a lifetime commitment and huge responsibility.\n\"I try to express to everybody who comes here to the sanctuary, responsibility and the responsibility of ownership for life. If they can't take care of the animal for life, find a place that maybe they can pay to keep their animal, like a retirement home for their horses. Horses are probably the most expensive animal to keep, especially in South Florida,\" she said.\nCampbell said seeing horses get dumped or neglected hits home for her and reminds her of her of two of her first horses named Del and Mar.\nShe said her family adopted Mar when she was just nine years old after the horse was injured and they learned it might be disposed of.\n\"She was going to go to the, back then we used to call it to the glue factory, so we ended up adopting her, and it changed my life. I couldn't show or do anything like that, but it didn't matter because I wanted to make sure that she was saved,\" she said.\nCampbell had Mar for 16 years through all different ups and downs in her life.\n\"I never let that horse down. I kept her till I was 29 years old, and eventually she told us when she was ready to go. So when I hear all these excuses why people can't or they won't or they feel like it's a better home or whatever, I get very frustrated,\" she added.\nSince the sanctuary opened in 1998, they've started offering more and more programs to introduce the community to the animals in their care.\n\"My core mission is to make sure that the animals that we have taken in that they have the best quality of care for the rest of their life and to make sure that we are making those important connections with people,\" Campbell said.\nDelmar Farm has more information on the programs they run, volunteer opportunities, and educational resources on their website.\nTop headlines:\n'This guy is an absolute animal': Vero Beach man accused of teenage murder-for-hire plot arrested\nStay up-to-date: The latest headlines and weather from WPBF 25\nGet the latest news updates with the WPBF 25 News app. You can download it here.",

    "title": "3 Keys to a Denver Broncos Victory Over Seattle Seahawks in Week 1",
    "text": "3 Keys to a Broncos Victory Over Seahawks in Week 1 Denver, CO — The start of the 2024 regular season pits the Denver Broncos against a familiar NFC rival, the Seattle Seahawks , spelling no love lost between the two historic franchises. Week 1's matchup kicks off on Sunday, September 8, at Lumen Field, where the Broncos are heavy underdogs on the road. This will be the second time in three seasons that both teams collide in the regular-season opener. The last time the Broncos played the Seahawks was Russell Wilson’s underwhelming return to Seattle in 2022, which resulted in a 17-16 loss for Denver. Neither team earned a trip to the playoffs in 2023 as the Broncos posted an 8-9 record while the Seahawks finished 9-8. Both teams aim to alter their 2024 trajectory with Denver’s first-round rookie quarterback Bo Nix leading the offense as first-year head coach Mike Macdonald ushers Seattle into a new defensive era post-Pete Carroll. If the Broncos expect to upset the Seahawks and The 12th Man, they must strictly adhere to these three keys to victory on the road. Don’t Baby Bo or the Offense Nix will become the first Broncos rookie quarterback to start Week 1 since John Elway in 1983. The No. 12 overall pick in this year's NFL draft earned the starting nod from Sean Payton after leading a successful training camp and capitalizing on a stellar preseason. Nix went 22-of-30 for 205 yards and two touchdowns in two games. Although Sunday will truly be Nix’s first day on the job as a professional, it’s not his first time lacing up his cleats in the Pacific Northwest. He started his first three college football seasons at Auburn before transferring to Oregon for two more years, cementing his legitimacy as an experienced first-round prospect. Nix exited the college ranks with 15,351 passing yards and 113 touchdowns, with 26 career interceptions, boasting a 66.4 completion percentage in an NCAA-record 61 starts. Since arriving in Denver, Nix has proven himself on the whiteboard and the practice field as the best man to run Payton’s demanding offense. Although a small sample size, it’d behoove Denver’s offense to remove any rookie handcuffs and let Nix manage pre-snap audibles and play alterations accordingly. His preparation and film study should aid the greenhorn in one of the loudest stadiums in the NFL, where we could see Denver’s offense use the silent or no-count snap. Expect short to medium passes from the perimeter to the middle of the field via slot receivers like Marvin Mims Jr. and big-bodied tight ends Adam Trautman, Greg Dulcich, and Donald Parnham Jr. I’d also expect running backs like Jaleel McLaughlin to be utilized in the passing game with screen passes to eliminate Seattle’s defensive aggression that will come from a variety of fronts. Nix’s quick release, decision-making, and calm demeanor should assist the Broncos' offense in moving the chains and could result in big plays downfield to Courtland Sutton. It'll be a baptism by fire for Nix, the 13th quarterback to open a game for the Broncos. What happens next on the Broncos beat? Don't miss out on any news and analysis!

Halt DL Leonard Williams One of the most important offseason priorities for Seattle was re-signing Williams to a three-year, $64.5 million contract. The former No. 6 overall draft pick spent 4.5 seasons with the New York Jets before he was traded to the New York Giants in 2019. Williams was named to the NFL’s Top 100 Players from 2020-22, playing for ‘Big Blue’ before he was traded to the Seahawks in October 2023. The 6-foot-5, 300-pound defender nicknamed ‘Big Cat’ is as quick and agile as his feline alias suggests on the line of scrimmage. Williams’ unique combination of size and speed allows him to rotate from the interior of the D-line to the edge, making him a threat to the Broncos' rushing attack. Denver’s offensive line will have its hands full combatting Williams, who will be observed in various positions among MacDonald’s 3-4 base defense. New Broncos starting center Luke Wattenberg and left guard Ben Powers could be tested by Seattle’s D-line and linebackers through a series of twists, stunts, and delayed blitz packages. Double teams for the Broncos O-line will almost need to be exclusively used for Williams regardless of where the 30-year-old Pro Bowler lines up. Rarely does a first-team offensive line need to prioritize blocking a single player before scraping to the second level of defenders, but Williams’ ability to raise hell in the trenches commands the attention of all five players. Williams finished the 2023 season playing in 18 games for both the Giants and Seahawks, recording 62 tackles (37 solo), 5.5 sacks, 16 QB hits, and 10 tackles for a loss. A healthy Broncos run game, effective or not, will be critical in deterring Williams from becoming a game wrecker in the trenches. Payton vs. Macdonald: Poise & Patience Critical Payton isn’t exactly known for being patient, and thankfully, neither is Broncos Country. Both play-caller and fan base completely recognize 2023's 8-9 finish as a failure because it meant the team missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season. This Sunday in Seattle, Payton has an opportunity to begin righting the ship with a difficult victory on the road with his rookie quarterback. With all the excitement of the Nix era starting in Denver, it’s easy to overlook other aspects of the head coaching role. Payton will need to contend with game and clock management, snap counts, injuries, adjustments, coaching challenges, rule changes, and many other challenges, which he’s dealt with since becoming a head coach in 2006. Meanwhile, Macdonald is looking to usher in a new chapter for the Seahawks. Macdonald arrived in Seattle having spent two separate stints with the Baltimore Ravens , where he cut his teeth as an intern, assistant, linebackers and defensive backs coach, and finally, defensive coordinator. He also spent time at Michigan in 2021 as defensive coordinator. The fiery 37-year-old is an aggressive, defensive play-caller, and he's looking to overcome three consecutive years of poor run defense in Seattle. Perhaps getting a Ravens-style defensive coach will translate to a new and nasty identity for the Seahawks, or at least that was the goal by making the hire. But implementing a base 3-4 defense and calling the defense is one thing; managing the football game and the team as a whole is a different task. Remember, Macdonald has never led a team as head coach at any level in his career, adding to the high-pressure stakes of this Sunday’s game. While the Las Vegas wise guys may scoff at the notion, I fully expect Payton's team to be more prepared on the road than Macdonald's. This is where Sean should make his hay, period.

Roosevelt, said radical environmentalists have misconstrued the ruling. “It is literally leveling off the playing field and making it easier for all citizens to push back against the federal bureaucracy that has become overpowered, and quite honestly is stepping outside of the bounds of the law,” he [told me on the District of Conservation](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-447-overturning-chevron-doctrine-wont-ruin-conservation/id1435126030?i=1000660870192) podcast. “What this ruling did was open up more opportunities for us as private citizens, as sportsmen, as anglers, as conservationists to push back against these types of ridiculous policies and regulations that have no basis in the law.” Casey Mattox, vice president of legal strategy at Stand Together, also [rebuked Chevron defenders](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3068057/good-riddance-chevron-deference/), writing, “Congress must do its duty rather than kick the can back to the agencies or the courts. That means clearer laws, more specificity, and more compromise.” Recommended How anti-democratic to return rulemaking to Congress where it belongs! The 40-year Chevron Deference - originating from the 1984 [Chevron vs. NRDC](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/) ruling - enabled the federal bureaucracy to grow unchecked when judges deferred to so-called expert regulators whenever laws were ambiguous. Chief Justice Roberts, writing the opinion, however [noted](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf) this can’t be applied retroactively: “By overruling Chevron, the Court does not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework.” But Justice Elena Kagan [argued](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/spr-crt-us/116329264.html) in her dissent, “Some agency interpretations never challenged under Chevron now will be.” The first test post-Chevron is a lawsuit [challenging](https://www.pionline.com/regulation/trial-dols-esg-rule-july-9-will-be-first-test-impact-chevron-ruling) the legality of the Department of Labor (DOL)’s [Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rule](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20221122) allowing the consideration of non-financial factors in 401(k) plans. But there are plenty of other circumstances where future application can apply to legal challenges of Biden’s radical climate agenda. Pending legal challenges to the Department of Energy (DOE)’s War on Household Appliances could lean on this decision. DOE, helmed by Secretary Jennifer Granholm, is pushing net-zero energy policies to force Americans to decarbonize their homes with enticements of promised “climate savings.” However, these directives will lead to more expensive household appliances that have been falsely advertised as “green.” A lawsuit [filed](https://cei.org/citations/biden-admin-hit-with-lawsuit-over-rules-about-dishwashers-and-washing-machines/) last month by the Competitive Enterprise Institute challenging DOE’s rules on dishwashers and washing machines could crack down on the lawless DOE. Why? The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals [ruled](https://www.iwf.org/2024/01/10/judges-biden-dishwater-clothes-washer-rules-dont-hold-water/) in January that it’s “unclear the Department of Energy has the statutory authority” to regulate water use in these appliances. Similarly, the Biden administration’s targeting of lead tackle and bullets on national wildlife refuge lands is another perfect candidate in a post-Chevron world. Banning lead tackle and bullets is a direct attack on fishing and hunting–the largest drivers of true conservation efforts in the U.S. The Biden administration [leans on faulty science](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2022/06/07/lead_ban_would_undermine_true_conservation_outdoor_access_835994.html) to justify incremental lead phaseouts of these items, conflating lead fragments with pure lead. But pending lawsuits challenging these lead phaseouts could proceed–and prevail–if plaintiffs prove the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can’t rewrite the Toxic Substances Control Act. And they might succeed going off of precedent from 2014 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia [determined](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2022/06/07/lead_ban_would_undermine_true_conservation_outdoor_access_835994.html) EPA “lacked statutory authority to regulate bullets and shots” under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Their decision a decade ago [argued](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/421BCEB1FE2C191285257DB70054D62E/$file/13-5228-1528839.pdf) EPA can’t regulate lead because it’s not ambiguous: “As in so many of our cases, the Supreme Court’s decision in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,1984), guides our review of EPA’s interpretation of TSCA. … Only if the statute is ambiguous do we defer to the agency’s reasonable construction. Id. Here, unlike the district court, we see nothing ambiguous about TSCA section 21. That provision allows “[a]ny person” to petition the agency for a rulemaking to regulate a toxic substance.” Chevron Deference’s end is a perfect [complement](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-1530) to the landmark 2022 West Virginia vs EPA decision that clamped down on EPA’s authority to craft rules that put net-zero energy goals above grid reliability. A bloated bureaucracy and an endless sea of regulations aren’t motivators for Americans to support conservation efforts. The opposite is true. The more onerous and [costly](https://www.hoover.org/research/high-price-environmental-regulations) regulations imposed on people under the guise of environmentalism, the less our peers are inclined to support related causes. Ironically, imposing climate-centric environmental regulations is shown to [harm the environment](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/317671-eliminate-regulations-that-dont-actually-help-the/) further. Even the EPA once [acknowledged](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-12/documents/ee-0422.pdf) onerous rulemaking is often “too expensive, reduces economic growth, hurts international competitiveness, and causes widespread layoffs and plant closures.” The Chevron Doctrine’s demise will prove this assertion correct: Deregulation won’t lead to the decimation of American conservation efforts.",

    "title": "Full list of police-recorded antisemitic and Islamophobic offences, by force | Ipswich Star",
    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6 The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached.

    "text": "Chef de la diplomatie burkinabé: \"L'année 2024 pour nous doit être une année de retour à la paix\" Chef de la diplomatie burkinabé : «L'année 2024 pour nous doit être une année de retour à la paix» S'abonner L’ambassade russe à Ouagadougou a repris ses activités après 31 ans. Au micro de Sputnik Afrique, le ministre burkinabé des Affaires étrangères partage ses impressions et ses attentes à l’occasion de cet événement. \"Le meilleur témoignage d'amitié et de coopération, ça se constate toujours sur le terrain et pas dans les discours. Et aujourd'hui, ce que nous avons vu, c'est un témoignage qui cadre parfaitement avec ce constat\", déclare Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré, ministre des Affaires étrangères du Burkina Faso sur la réouverture de [l’ambassade](https://fr.sputniknews.africa/20231228/ce-que-signifie-la-reprise-des-activites-de-lambassade-russe-au-burkina-1064361174.html)de Russie dans son pays. \"La multipolarité, par définition, suppose qu'on reconnaisse les capacités d'autres pays à se hisser sur la scène internationale. Et cette position est défendue par la Russie et soutenue par le Burkina Faso. Il est inconcevable que nous soyons dans un monde à plus de 200 pays, à plus de 7 milliards d'habitants, et que le monopole soit concentré entre les mains d'un seul pays qui en constitue le pôle. Non. Il faut sortir de cet engrenage pour permettre la pleine expression des capacités de chacun des pays autour des différents pôles qui vont se constituer\", ajoute le ministre sur le concept de multipolarité défendu par la Russie. \"Je vois l'année 2024 avec beaucoup d'espoir et d'attente. Espoir parce que la Russie soutient le Burkina Faso dans sa lutte contre le [terrorisme](https://fr.sputniknews.africa/20231211/larmee-burkinabe-elimine-un-chef-terroriste-au-sahel-1064070915.html). L'année 2024 pour nous doit être une année de retour à la paix. Et qui dit retour à la paix, dit reprise de la croissance\", selon M.Traoré.
