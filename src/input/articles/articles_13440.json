    "text": "Well, folks, here’s the lowdown—a red warning for rain has been activated in Huelva until 9:00 a.m. Apparently, Mother Nature is throwing quite the tantrum, and it’s not just a sulky drizzle; we’ve got a red alert! Now that’s the weather’s equivalent of kicking the dog… Absolutely not okay! You’d think they’d just get the hint and take it easy, but no, it seems the skies have a vendetta against umbrella manufacturers in Huelva!\nThe State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) is urging everyone to proceed with extreme caution—like Michael Flatley dancing in a minefield. So, what do we do? Well, apparently, the genius play is to avoid traveling! If you were planning on going anywhere, you might want to grip your couch a little tighter and settle in for a bit of the old Netflix and rain romance—unless you fancy becoming a cast member in “Drenched: The Musical!”\n📢 BREAKING NEWS | EXTREME caution with #DANA in #Huelva .\n🔴Red notice due to rain observation 🌧️in Litoral Huelva, Andévalo and Condado until 9:00 a.m. ⌚️. Protect yourself. Avoid traveling.\n▶️More than 40 warnings due to flooding in Huelva, Aljaraque, Cartaya, P. Umbría and Gibraleón. pic.twitter.com/klARljyYFw\n— Emergencies 112 (@E112Andalucia) November 1, 2024\nAnd hey, if you think it’s just a Huelva thing, think again! DANA, that lovable but psychotic rain co-worker, will be paying a visit to the rest of Andalusia, under the Ebro, and the dazzling Balearic Islands this Friday. Expect torrential rain—just think of it as nature’s attempt to create the world’s largest swimming pool. Well, it’s either that or we string up a “No Swimming” sign during an afternoon thunderstorm. Grab your sunblock and your inflatable flamingo because it’s going to be quite the soggy adventure in the southwest!\nBut enough about the rain—let’s touch on a slightly brighter note! Seven out of eight lost Ecuadorians have been found alive after the floods. I mean, I could wax lyrical about relief and hope, but seriously, what luck! If they’d gone missing looking for a good tapas bar, they’d have just needed a compass and possibly a well-placed tortilla.\nMeanwhile, across the pond, the United States is extending its deepest condolences for the tragic loss of life. A generous sentiment, though it kind of feels as if they’re saying, “Hey, we’re sorry for your flood, but at least we didn’t get caught in it!” Nice try, America. But if you could send over some life vests for the next weather drama, we’d all appreciate it.\nThe United States extends our deepest condolences to the people of Spain for the tragic loss of life due to unprecedented flooding. Our thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones due to recent extreme weather.\n— Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox) November 1, 2024\nComing back to real life, people have been launching themselves into the streets in Valencia like they’ve got a free ticket to a rock concert—helping clean up and providing basic supplies. That’s the human spirit for you—shining bright amidst floodwaters! It’s a beautiful mess when you think about it. Not the flood, but people coming together, thinking of others. Just goes to show, if you want a positive outcome from a miserable situation, you need to collaborate like it’s a group project in college—just minus the one guy who does nothing.\nIt’s incredible how much help you can muster when the chips are down. The Community of Madrid is sending a second Emergency and Immediate Response team to Valencia. It’s basically the Justice League of rainy day responses—17 seasoned professionals and some canine companions ready to save the day. Who needs superheroes when you have hardy dudes and their trusty four-legged friends? It’s a feel-good story waiting to happen, especially if one of the dogs happens to don a cape.\nSo, whether you’re hunkering in Huelva or knee-deep in Valencia, remember: there’s always a silver lining amidst the chaos. Well, that, and a lot of puddles. As they say, today’s forecast: 100% chance of sarcasm with a sprinkle of hope. Hold on tight, and let’s ride out this storm together!\nThe red warning for rain in Huelva is activated until 9:00 a.m.\nThe State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) has officially activated a red warning for rain across the heavily impacted Huelva coast as well as in the regions of Arévalo and Condado, effective until 9:00 a.m. this morning.

However, forecasters indicate that chances of rain are minimal or highly unlikely in the northern regions of Galicia, the Cantabrian Sea, northern Northern Plateau, and upper Ebro, although they cannot be completely ruled out in other areas.\nMaximum temperatures are expected to rise in the western parts of the peninsula, while experiencing declines elsewhere. Minimum temperatures will see an increase in the southwest and the Cantabrian region, with no significant changes anticipated for the remainder of the country.\nWinds will predominantly be of an eastern component across both the Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, generally remaining weak inland, but potentially intensifying along the coasts. Special attention is required in areas of Cádiz and the Balearics where stronger wind intervals may occur, while the Canary Islands will experience markedly lighter winds.\n* Information prepared by EFE.\nSeven of the eight Ecuadorians missing in Spain after floods found alive\nThe Ecuadorian government announced with relief that seven of the eight missing Ecuadorians have been located and found alive following the recent devastating effects of DANA in Spain.

    "title": "NCCE cautions marginalised groups against accepting money from politicians to vote",
    "text": "By Michael Foli Jackidy Ho (V/R), Nov. 29, GNA – Mr Ken Kponor, the Volta Regional Director of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), has urged marginalised groups to reject monetary inducements from politicians or political parties in exchange for their votes. He said monetary inducement could compromise the integrity of the elections and had long-term negative consequences on governance and the lives of the electorate. Mr Kponor gave the advice at civic education forum in Ho where he addressed audiences including women’s groups and persons with disabilities, on the importance of voting responsibly. The forum was organised as part of the NCCE’s mandate to promote peaceful elections and it was in collaboration with the International Republican Institute (IRI) with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Mr Kponor warned that accepting money to vote could result in electing unqualified leaders, leading to poor governance. “We must not be tempted to trade our votes for money. If we allow this practice to continue, it will become a major problem in the future, affecting governance and development,” he cautioned. He encouraged the participants to focus on the long-term implications of their voting choices rather than short-term financial gain, adding that avoiding vote-buying was crucial to ensuring the election of the right leaders, who would prioritise the needs of the people over personal interests. Mr Kponor also highlighted the growing problem of misinformation and disinformation, urging participants to verify information before sharing them. “Many of us receive messages on our phones and forward them without checking the accuracy. This can contribute to the spread of false information,” he said reminding participants that spreading fake news could have serious repercussions, including legal consequences. To ensure participants were well-prepared for election day, Mr Kponor provided a step-by-step guide on how to correctly cast their ballots to avoid spoiling them and their votes rejected. He emphasised the importance of properly marking the ballot papers to ensure that their votes would be counted. Mr Joshua Hebidzi, the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer at the International Republican Institute, underscored the importance of empowering marginalized groups to participate in the electoral process. He explained that IRI’s collaboration with NCCE aimed to enhance accountability among politicians and encourage electoral reforms. “Our focus is on providing voter education to marginalized groups, including women, persons with disabilities, and youth,” he said. Mr Oral Robert Amenyo, the Deputy Volta Regional Director for NCCE, urged women to exercise their right to vote without fear of intimidation. “In a democratic society, every individual, including marginalised groups, is guaranteed rights and freedoms under the constitution,” he stated. He encouraged women to take an active role in the electoral process and be confident in their civic duties. Some of the participants expressed their gratitude for the education provided by NCCE, acknowledging the value of the information and pledged to reject vote-buying while committing to responsible voting. This initiative by NCCE and IRI is part of ongoing efforts to ensure free, fair, and credible elections in Ghana, particularly in the Volta Region, by empowering marginalised groups with the knowledge and confidence to make informed decisions at the polls.

    "title": "Scott Jennings Pleads with Tiffany Cross to Stop Insulting Jews by Equating ICE Facilities to Nazi Camps",
    "text": "Ex-MSNBC host Tiffany Cross doesn’t care that she’s minimizing the true horror of the Holocaust by comparing air-conditioned illegal alien detention facilities to Nazi concentration camps. She keeps pushing the fake equivalence despite neither being remotely the same thing. Republican commentator Scott Jennings even told her how insulting she was, but it was to no avail.\nSee and hear for yourself. (WATCH)\nScott Jennings and Tiffany Cross battle over her comparison of ICE detention facilities to Nazi concentration camps.\n— Thomas Hern (@ThomasMHern)\n\"That's offensive to Jewish people, by the way. Every time you say that, I get a thousand texts. Comparing that to the Holocaust is WILD.\"[pic.twitter.com/HMPjX4HA3v][July 16, 2025]\nHer ignorance could not be contained.\nEven Jennings appears to have reached the end of his rope with Cross.\nScott Jennings is over it.\n— The Undercurrent (@NotTheirScript)[pic.twitter.com/1vnfI54lnU][July 16, 2025]\nI think Tiffany Cross finally found Scott's limit.\n— Thomas Hern (@ThomasMHern)\nComparing ICE facilities to Nazi concentration camps.\nNot sure how anyone can think being given three meals a day, beds, showers, and transportation to their home country is comparable to Nazi concentration camps.[July 16, 2025]\nHe tolerates a lot more than I think I could.\n— The Undercurrent (@NotTheirScript)[July 16, 2025]\nYou could tell her stupidity was affecting him physically, which is saying something since his tolerance levels would be off the charts doing these panel shows several nights a week.\nPosters drive home that places like Alligator Alcatraz are nothing like concentration camps.\nWrong. Nazis permanently imprisoned German CITIZENS based solely on RACE/RELIGION. They wouldn’t LET them leave the country. Enslaved them and killed them. Trump is temporarily detaining ALIENS based on ILLEGAL status. He is HELPING them leave. No one is being enslaved or killed.\n— Selene (@agravematter)[pic.twitter.com/3WSYeNyIV3][July 16, 2025]\nHow intellectually dishonest can you get?\n— Dean (@digitaldean)\nSo is ICE rounding up and then k!lling anyone.\nNo.\nEveryone they are arresting, detaining and deporting are illegal aliens.\nThis isn’t some genocide or ethnic cleansing\nGet a grip and take off your tinfoil hat[July 16, 2025]\nThey don't believe it themselves. It's just their old tactic of calling everything they don't like a nazi.\n— Chem (@c_h_e_m)\nThat worked for a while a decade ago but people are now fed up with up and see trough their charade.[July 16, 2025]\nSent back to your own country > being burned alive\n— JeffHart (@JeffHart24)\nIn the end, its all about the census and Congressional seats.[July 16, 2025]\nCorrect. All the histrionics over illegal aliens are about ending all deportations so Democrats can continue to inflate census numbers and not lose congressional seats or Electoral College votes. It's about power for them.\nEditor’s Note: Democrat politicians and their radical supporters will do everything they can to interfere with and threaten ICE agents enforcing our immigration laws.\nHelp us hold these leftists accountable and expose their obstruction.

    "text": "El Ballet Nacional de Cuba (BNC) bajo la dirección general de la primera bailarina, Viengsay Valdés, concluyó este sábado en la sala Avellaneda del Teatro Nacional la temporada de Giselle, con la internacionalmente aclamada versión coreográfica de Alicia Alonso, sobre la original de Jules Perrot y Jean Coralli. A pesar de que comenzó en medio de un clima tempestuoso, que provocó afectaciones eléctricas en el teatro y la cancelación de dos funciones, fue una temporada exitosa que contó con la participación de invitados especiales, debuts de principales figuras de la compañía en los roles protagónicos, así como las actuaciones de los primeros bailarines, y celebró fechas significativas en la historia del BNC. El lluvioso viernes 22 de marzo la bailarina principal, Chavela Riera, se convirtió en la Giselle número 30 que ha protagonizado la gran obra de la Era Romántica con la compañía. Esa función marcó también la reaparición en escenarios cubanos de Semyon Chudin, estrella del Ballet Bolshoi, como artista invitado en el papel de Albretch; y del ex primer bailarín del BNC, Joel Carreño, en el papel de Hilarión. En esa noche surgió una nueva Myrtha, reina de las Wilis, interpretada por Gabriela Druyet. Dos nuevos Albretch también debutaron en esta temporada: el primer bailarín Yankiel Vázquez, en la noche del viernes 29 de marzo, junto a la primera bailarina Gretel Morejón, función en la que se estrenó Alianed Moreno como Myrtha; y el bailarín principal Ányelo Montero de la mano de la experimentada primera bailarina Viengsay Valdés, quienes cerraron con broche de oro estas presentaciones de Giselle el sábado 30. El resto de los días, incluyendo la función adicional vespertina del viernes 29, los roles protagónicos fueron interpretados por las primeras bailarinas Anette Delgado, Sadaise Arencibia, el primer bailarín Dani Hernández y el primer bailarín de carácter Ernesto Díaz. Con esta temporada el BNC celebró importantes aniversarios artísticos de cuatro primeros bailarines: los 30 años de vida profesional de Viengsay Valdés, los 25 de Sadaise Arencibia y Ernesto Díaz, y los 20 del debut en el papel titular de Giselle por Anette Delgado. Asimismo, conmemoró el aniversario 175 del estreno en Cuba de la versión completa del célebre ballet de Adolphe Adam, el 14 de febrero de 1849, en el entonces Gran Teatro de Tacón, hoy Gran Teatro de La Habana Alicia Alonso, y constituyó también el debut en Latinoamérica. El estreno estuvo a cargo de la compañía de los Ravel, con Enriqueta Wells (Giselle), Enrique Wells (Albretch), Francisco Ravel (Hilarión) y Adela Lehmann (Myrtha).",
