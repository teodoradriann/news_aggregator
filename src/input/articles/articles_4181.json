A equipe de Florença pressionou e virou o jogo com um gol de Antonin Barák já aos 50 minutos da etapa final.\nEssa vitória permite que a equipe do técnico Vincenzo Italiano se classifique para as quartas de final com um empate no jogo de volta, que acontece na quinta-feira da semana que vem (24) às 14h45 no horário de Brasília em Florença.\nO Maccabi precisará vencer por um gol para forçar uma prorrogação ou por dois gols para avançar no tempo normal.\nNo domingo (10), a Fiorentina recebe a Roma às 16h45 no horário de Brasília pelo Campeonato Italiano.\nA Viola está em oitavo lugar com 42 pontos, nove atrás da zona de classificação para a próxima Liga dos Campeões da Europa, a 11 jogos do fim do campeonato.? .",

Even our indoor taps burn when you run them on cold here in Brisbane so we’ve told the kids to run it for a while then test it quickly with their arm after it’s been running for a while!’ one mum wrote.\n‘Also do this before spraying the dogs too! They always run for it strait away so keep it low to the grass while it cools down,’ another said.\nA third mum wasn’t taking any chances revealed the next step she took to protect her kids.\n‘We also replaced all of our outside taps so the handle comes off to prevent the kids from turning the water on themselves,’ she said.\nBut others deemed the advice as ‘common sense’.\n‘Always test water on yourself before your toddler,’ one wrote.\n‘If you’re living in Australia that should be common knowledge! Everyone knows when it’s hot – don’t walk on the sand with bare feet!’ another said.",

    "text": "In the statement of the Foreign Office, the expression of readiness towards peace with India and constructive dialogue to discuss issues is a positive sign. Sideways, Pakistan has also reiterated its stance on Jammu & Kashmir, which means that any prospects for peace must respect the country’s principled stance. Both sides have a lot to gain from peace but building peace over the unjust oppression of Kashmiri Muslims does not align with Pakistan’s core foreign policy values. The emphasis that India must show a willingness to enter into dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and equality is a call that Pakistan is clear about how to proceed. For many years now, dialogue between India and Pakistan remains suspended. But it is important to break this absence into regular and meaningful exchanges. Peace is a desirability for this region and a prerequisite for mutually beneficial political, diplomatic, and economic relations. More so, Pakistan’s aspirations to join BRICS tell that it wants to be a part of inclusive multilateralism, especially the one that seeks to include developing countries and break them free from Western dependency. As a neighbouring country, India should not be a hurdle in this endeavour. This again emphasises why peace between the two neighbours is paramount. However, India’s crackdown on political dissent in J&K is not tolerated by Pakistan. And Foreign Office expressed this clearly in the condemnation statement over a fresh ban that India imposed on Muslim League Jammu Kashmir, Masarrat Alam faction. India has been. The political entity has been declared unlawful for five years. And this is not the first time it has happened. There is a history of detaining independent political voices in J&K. Pakistan has consistently denounced all such action by its neighbour. Though there is pragmatism involved in creating a conducive environment of cooperation in the region, it is noteworthy that Pakistan prefers to take its principled stance alongside. As for responding to foreign missions’ comments on Baloch protests in the country, the Foreign Office reinforces Pakistan’s position on handling internal matters independently.",

    "title": "Comment on Batata Vada by Kanan Patel",
    "text": "Batata Vada\nBatata vada is popular Maharashtrian street food. This can be served with a hot cup of tea/coffee or with dipping sauces like cilantro chutney or ketchup. Or batata vada can be used while making vada pav.\nBatata vada means potato fritters (aloo vada or potato vada).\n❤️About This Batata Vada Recipe\nBatata vada has two components, inner filling and outer coating.\n- The inner filling is made from boiled, mashed potatoes and it is seasoned with ginger, garlic, green chili and curry leaves.\n- For outer coating, the thick batter is made from besan (gram flour), rice flour and seasoned with salt, turmeric and chili powder.\n- The round balls are made from potato filling. Then balls are dipped into the batter and deep-fried into the hot oil.\nDeep Frying is a must.\n- No, this cannot be shallow fried.\n- They have to be submerged into the oil while frying to keep the round shape intact.\n- If they are shallow fried then you’ll end up with flat vada and not a perfect round.\n- This is the only reason I don’t make these vada often as I have to heat a whole lot of oil that I can’t reuse. Plus, these are full of calories.\nThis batata vada recipe is the Maharashtrian style. There is another version is Gujarati style where potato filling is not seasoned with tempering.\nIn the Gujarati version, ginger-chili paste, cilantro, red chili powder, salt, sugar, lemon juice, etc are added to the boiled, mashed potato. Personally, I prefer this Mumbai style batata vada, as the Gujarati version has mild flavors.\n🧾 Ingredient Notes\n- Potatoes: I prefer to use Yukon gold or red skin potatoes. I avoid using Idaho potatoes as you can’t make the balls after they are boiled and mashed as they are high in starch and low in moisture.\n- Ginger, Garlic, Green chili – You can crush all three together. Or simply use ginger garlic paste and finely chopped green chilies.\n- Curry leaves: These are must-add as they add a nice aroma and flavor to the potato filling.\n- Lemon juice: It is optional. Some don’t prefer to add any lemon or lime juice.\n- Besan + Rice flour: The addition of rice flour makes the outer coating crispy. So I like to add it. But traditionally, the batter is just made from besan and spices.\n- Baking soda: a tiny pinch is added to make the batter and outer coating light. You can skip it as I don’t see much difference without soda.\n👩🍳 How To Make Batata Vada? (Stepwise)\nMaking Potato Filling:\nBoil the potatoes in instant pot or pressure cooker. Once cool to touch, peel them and mash them using a potato masher.\n1) Heat the oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot add mustard seeds and let them splutter.

Saute for 30-40 seconds or until the raw smell of ginger-garlic goes away.\n2) Add hing and turmeric powder.\n3) Immediately add mashed potatoes and salt.\n4) Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the mixture is almost dry.\n5) Turn off the stove.

Mix well.\n2) Add water and stir to make a lump-free batter. The batter should not be too thin or too thick. It has to be thick yet runny consistency.\nMaking Batata Vada:\n1) Heat the oil in a kadai or pan on medium heat for deep frying. Make sure to add enough oil so that vada are submerged into the oil.\n2) Once the oil is hot, take one ball, and dip it into the batter. Move around so it is coated with the batter from all sides.\n3) Now pick up the ball using your finger or use a spoon.\n4) Gently slide the vada into the hot oil. Do not disturb them for 2 minutes otherwise, they will break into the oil. After that stir or move around in the oil for even browning.\n5) Once they are fried to crisp and light golden color, remove them using a slotted spoon, and drain excess oil.\n6) Place them on a paper towel lined plate. Serve them hot.\nNOTE: Make a slit into green chilies and fry in the oil until they have blisters on the surface. Remove it from the oil, sprinkle some salt on top and serve with vada.\n💭 Expert Tips For BEST Batata Vada\n- The potato filling mixture should not have too much moisture or water.
