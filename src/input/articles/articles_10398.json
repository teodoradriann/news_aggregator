    "text": "Es el medio independiente 404 Media el que informa de esta nueva evolución de la inteligencia artificial generativa. En un extenso blog técnico, Niantic Labs presenta su última innovación: un Sistema de Posicionamiento Visual (o VPS) capaz de identificar tu posición en el mundo real al centímetro más cercano con una simple foto en tu teléfono. Por ejemplo, el estudio quiere utilizar esta tecnología para sincronizar lo que ves en realidad aumentada con lo que otros jugadores pueden observar para crear un universo compartido en tiempo real.\nEn última instancia, Niantic pretende revolucionar la inteligencia artificial generativa con un gran modelo geoespacial (LGM), una tecnología capaz de encontrar su camino en el espacio como un ser humano. Si el software ve una iglesia, puede imaginar lo que hay detrás, encima, a los lados y solo produce contenido a escala. En una palabra, “ permitir que las computadoras perciban y comprendan espacios físicos » en el que evolucionamos hacia un software de realidad aumentada cada vez más creíble.\nSin embargo, para dar forma a este LGM, Niantic necesita muchos datos. Y la fuente eres tú, informa 404 Media. Si desde julio de 2024 es posible desactivar el intercambio de datos específicos del juego para evitar participar en este programa, el blog de Niantic indica que la compañía lleva cinco años trabajando en esta inteligencia artificial generativa. El estudio también presume de obtener un millón de escaneos geográficos semanales a través de sus aplicaciones, y de recopilar datos muy valiosos ya que sus usuarios son peatones que pueden tomar caminos inaccesibles para los vehículos, que suelen ser el medio elegido por las empresas para fotografiar y cartografiar el mundo real. .\nEsto es suficiente para relanzar el eterno debate sobre la ética de la inteligencia artificial generativa, en cualquier caso, de sus apóstoles y de las empresas que las construyen. Recientemente, fueron los actores japoneses quienes fundaron un movimiento para proteger sus voces contra la IA generativa.\n- Lea también | Tras dos oleadas de despidos, Riot Games (League of Legends) invierte en IA generativa",

    "title": "Humboldt Hero | Marine veteran to be honored on Friday in Eureka - Eureka Times-Standard",
    "text": "Name: Joe Massei and Carlos Carbajal\nService branch: Marine Corps\nThe December 2023 Humboldt Hero is Joe Massei, and he is sharing the spotlight with his fallen comrade in arms, Carlos Carbajal.\nAnthony Joseph Massei III was born on Sept. 10, 1948, at St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka. “Joe” was raised in Eureka and graduated from St. Bernard’s Catholic School. He attended the College of the Redwoods for a semester and played football there.\nMassei enlisted in the Marine Corps on Nov. 1, 1968, because he wanted to serve his country. Basic training was at the Marine Corps recruit depot in San Diego. As a private, he went to infantry training at Camp Pendelton and advanced to private 1st class. On deployment to Vietnam, he advanced to lance corporal and then corporal ranking. He was a 0311 infantry rifleman.\nJoe served in Da Nang, Hue, Khe Sanh, Con Tien, Dong Ha, Quang Tri, and on the border of the demilitarized zone. During his service, Massei received a Purple Heart and numerous other awards.\nJoe Massei’s brother Mike joined the Marine Corps about a year after he did. One time when Joe was at the Da Nang airport while on “R&R” in Vietnam, a person came up behind him, tapped him on the shoulder and said, “Joe, is that you?” It was his brother, Mike! The scheduled flights for both Joe and Mike were delayed about three hours, giving them precious and unexpected time to visit.\nAnother surprise the brothers received while in Vietnam was news their parents were expecting another child. Their baby sister Anna Marie was born while they were both still deployed.\nAfter discharge, Massei began working at McGaraghan’s department store and met his mentor and lifelong friend Frank McGaraghan. Massei purchased a men’s wear store from McGarahan, owned a liquor display business, worked as a bodyguard, and completed his work life with Massei Logging.\nMassei has been a member of the Here and Now group at the Eureka Veteran’s Center since 1987. He is a founding member of the Boys and Girls Club in Eureka, and is active in the DAV, VFW, Henderson Center Kiwanas, Sons of Italy, and Eureka Elks Club. He has been on the St. Bernard’s Crusader Athletic Board for more than 25 years and is also a Grand Knight for the Knights of Columbus Council 3103.\nFriday’s recognition is also about a young Marine from San Diego named Carlos Carbajal. He served alongside Massei on the border of the DMZ in Vietnam. They were going to do mine sweeps between Dong Ha and Con Tien one morning in 1969 when Carbajal received word through the Red Cross that he had just become the father of a baby girl. Carbajal was overjoyed and asked Joe to take a picture of him to send home to his family. Two hours later, Carbajal was killed while standing five feet away from Massei.\nWhen Joe returned home, he tried for more than 50 years and in many ways to contact Carbajal’s family, through investigators, police, public records, and messages on social media. He wanted Carbajal’s daughter, wife, and family to know the great joy it brought Carlos to know he was a father of a baby girl.\nOn Memorial Day this year, the Massei family received an email from Carbajal’s niece, who had found a message that Joe’s wife Mary had posted on a veterans’ website a year earlier. She let them know that Carbajal’s daughter Carla was doing well and lives in Chula Vista with her mother. Massei was able to share the photo with his family.\nCarla grew up very loved and is the oldest of 30 cousins. She has three children of her own and recently became a grandmother. Carbajal has 10 siblings, all still alive, and most of whom live in the San Diego area. Carbajal’s name is on a memorial wall in one of the San Diego parks, and he is interred at Fort Rosencrans there with a beautiful view of the ocean.\nThe extremely close-knit extended family still gets together annually in Carbajal’s childhood home, and in May 2024, Joe Massei and his wife Mary are planning to make a trip there to visit with Carla, her mother, and all of the large and loving family.\nIf you go\nWhat: Monthly Humboldt Heroes celebration.\nWhen: Noon today\nWhere: 537 7th St., Eureka\nNominate a “Humboldt Hero”: “Humboldt Heroes” normally honors local veterans on the last Friday of the month. If you’d like to nominate a local veteran for recognition, or help sponsor the ongoing program, contact State Farm insurance agent Scott Hammond at 707-444-2504.",

    "text": "Shocking footage has captured the [terrifying moment](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather) a tornado hit a Manchester street, causing damage to dozens of homes and cars. There was a major incident put in place in the area after the windstorm with speeds of up to 160mph hit the residential street. One couple who were on holiday when it hit came home to find a \"fist-sized\" hole in their BMW caused by the strong winds and chaos, reports [the Manchester Evening News.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/stalybridge-tornado-greater-manchester-cctv-28360256) Craig, whose car and home were damaged, said: \"We were away in Whitby for a couple of nights and one of our neighbours called us just after it happened at midnight to let us know what the damage was. \"They told us our roof was a mess and we had a big hole in the front of our car from one of the tiles that came down. We packed up early doors and made our way home. \"We have severe roof damage - we have lost 50 to 60 tiles at the front and back of the house. The car is damaged, the bonnet, all down the side, the windscreen. The hole in the bonnet you can put your fist through it.\" He continued: \"It is a bit freaky. Our home is in the epicentre of where all the damage was caused. I have been filling out my insurance form writing 'tornado', I never thought I would write that word in my life. \"The footage from the CCTV showed garden furniture spinning around and when we looked closely you could see our shed being shaken.\" The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) visited the site and confirmed the area was hit by a tornado with a provisional maximum damage rating of T5, which sees winds of 137 to 160 mph. The category would result in cars levitating, entire roofs being removed, items sucked from inside houses - like furniture - utility poles snapping, and older weaker buildings collapsing completely. Cllr Ged Cooney also said: “We are now in the recovery phase following the step down of a major incident declared last night when a ‘mini tornado’ hit Stalybridge. \"Thankfully there are no casualties from the incident but there are of course local residents who are devastated by the damage caused to their homes. \"With around 100 homes affected, the council is working to support residents, making sure they have a safe place to stay while they cannot re-enter their homes.\" He added: \"I’d like to thank our emergency services and council officers for all their continued work. The local community have also been so generous in offering their support and we never fail to see a true sense of community spirit and support in situations like these.

    "title": "Opinión. Tan joven y tan viejos. Los encuentros con genocidas y la edad como (no) fundamento",
    "text": "Hace unas semanas nos enteramos por los medios de comunicación de la visita de diputadas y diputados nacionales de LLA a genocidas alojados en la cárcel de Ezeiza, entre los más relevantes, Alfredo Astiz. \"Yo no viví en esa época, nací en 1993 y no tengo ni idea de quiénes eran los personajes de esa época. La verdad es que vi internos de 80 años y yo no sabía los nombres ni las caras\". La frase es de la diputada mendocina de La Libertad Avanza, Lourdes Arrieta tras ser cuestionada por las visitas a la cárcel de Ezeiza en las que se entrevistó, junto a otros diputados de su espacio político, [con genocidas de la última dictadura](https://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Sonriendo-con-genocidas-asi-posaron-los-diputados-de-La-Libertad-Avanza). En la pretensión de impunidad y en el marco de la propaganda contra los derechos humanos y las libertades democráticas, el gobierno de Milei y sus partidarios expresan a viva voz y en sus actos, los deseos y aspiraciones de quienes aún siguen cometiendo delitos de lesa humanidad con silencio y complicidades. Porque, como dijo Myriam Bregman, están dispuestos a volver a hacerlo. Tan joven Decir que ser joven legitima la ignorancia es el fundamento más nefasto que se pueda escuchar. No creemos que fue la juventud ni la ignorancia el motivo de tal visita, sino que el único objetivo buscado es el de intentar dar un mensaje impunidad. Después de años de pelea por memoria verdad y justicia, nada de eso les va a salir bien. De la visita de diputados a genocidas ya se conocieron las fotos. Cual equipo de fútbol o foto familiar, lo que se ve no son solo un grupo de personas posando sonriente sino un grupo de criminales y sus cómplices, todos conscientes de lo que hacían e hicieron. En el centro de la escena, la diputada mendocina Lourdes Arrieta que por más patitos en la cabeza se ponga (así con ese accesorio se apersonó en una sesión de la cámara), lo menos que tiene es ingenuidad. Ante el conocimiento público de los hechos, y sobre todo el extendido repudio que provocó en amplios sectores democráticos, pretendió una disculpa sacando a relucir su juventud como absurdo argumento para justificar un supuesto desconocimiento de la historia más reciente y más difundida en los últimos 40 años de Argentina, siendo que su propio espacio político ha tenido, además, una constante iniciativa en este terreno, negando por ejemplo los propios crímenes de la dictadura. Con su relato en nombre de la juventud y de los que tienen bronca, quieren imponer un discurso negacionista y represivo. Pero mal que les pese, en nuestro país hay una juventud y una gran parte de la sociedad, que pide y pedirá justicia hasta que cada uno de los represores y sus cómplices empresarios, civiles y eclesiásticos sean condenados. “Espíritu setentista, vuelve hoy…” cantábamos en homenaje a esa juventud de sentimiento rebelde y revulsivo, a esos que pelearon por un mundo sin injusticia y por la verdadera libertad. Esos jóvenes a los que quisieron apropiarles todo, hasta sus hijos. Esos jóvenes no se van más, están para decirnos a las nuevas generaciones que sus banderas son las nuestras, son las que levantamos a voz alzada y en carne viva. Los genocidas quisieron exterminar eso y por más que se esfuercen no lo van a conseguir. Somos memoria, verdad y justicia. Tan viejos En todo este marco, la discusión por la edad de los genocidas desató no solo las especulaciones por un cumplimiento de pena en sus domicilios y por ello el motivo de las visitas a Ezeiza. En los últimos días Mendoza fue escenario de declaraciones de la ministra Patricia Bullrich junto con el ministro de justicia Cuneo Libarona, pidiendo igualdad para los asesinos, torturadores, apropiadores y desaparecedores (cuyos delitos siguen vigentes aun con estos en la cárcel), con presos comunes. La edad, nuevamente como excusa. En este caso, la avanzada edad de los represores junto con los estados de salud, buscan ser los fundamentos de los pedidos de los funcionarios. ¿Quién podría pensar que la vejez es lo que realmente sensibiliza a Bullrich y compañía? ¿En un país donde la mayoría de la población es pobre y en esa mayoría, los más pobres e indigentes son jubilados y jubiladas junto a niños, niñas y adolescentes, y donde una de las medidas más brutales del gobierno del que es ministra, fue la de atacar las jubilaciones para destinar ese dinero en beneficio de los grandes empresarios y el pago de la deuda al FMI?. Al mismo tiempo que Bullrich, Petri, Cuneo Libarona piden impunidad para los represores, presentan planes y proyectos de más cárcel y represión, ya no solo para quienes se organizan contra los ataques de su gobierno, sino también contra las infancias, los que protestan, y los más vulnerados.

En 2011 el juez Otilio Romano, camarista federal que fue denunciado junto a otros jueces por delitos de lesa humanidad, fue encontrado fugado en Chile. Fue extraditado al tiempo de conocida la noticia de su fuga. Recién en 2017 fue encontrado culpable de delitos de lesa humanidad en una mega causa de peso histórico, en la que por primera vez se juzgaba a personas civiles y miembros de la justicia. Quien gran parte de su vida se creyó impune, el Juez Romano sin embargo será recordado, además de por sus aberrantes delitos en la última dictadura, por fugado y por atacar violentamente a testigos en las audiencias de los juicios, especialmente a mujeres. Gracias a la pelea de organismos de derechos humanos, familiares, organizaciones sociales y políticas, se logró una sentencia a perpetua histórica e inédita. La foto, la verdadera historia, la edad y el no pasarán Una imagen más que gráfica. En el centro de la foto que se mostró de los diputados de La Libertad Avanza y los genocidas sonriendo para la cámara, puede verse una cruz cual bendición de la iglesia. La presunta “ignorante” diputada no fue sola a Ezeiza, y es que además de ir con sus compañeros libertarios, fue con una historia familiar de complicidades y torturas. Su padre, Tomás Arrieta, es un militar denunciado por torturas en Malvinas por parte de ex soldados, pibes que tenían 18 años en la guerra, que declararon haber recibido de su parte la aplicación de tormentos y privación de alimentos. El cuento del desconocimiento de las aberraciones cometidas por los milicos y genocidas, se desacredita solo. Hoy, cuando la reacción intenta crear un clima de revisión de nuestras conquistas y las enormes peleas por memoria verdad y justicia, levantamos bien alto la militancia, la lucha y tesón de las madres, las abuelas, de Nora, María, Agustina y otras, de las tradiciones que han dado la fuerza y el coraje a muchas generaciones, aun cuando algunos nos llamaron a conformarnos o a resignarnos, ellas son un verdadero ejemplo vivo. Quienes somos esos jóvenes y esos viejos que retomamos estas banderas y peleamos por una vida que realmente merezca ser vivida, seguimos enfrentando a los dueños del horror y sus cómplices. Mientras hoy, más pretenden prohibirnos expresarnos libremente, con criminalización a la protesta social, con imputaciones a las y los luchadores y con causas armadas, más decimos NO PASARÁN!. 30 mil compañeras y compañeros detenidos desaparecidos PRESENTES!",
