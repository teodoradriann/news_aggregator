    "title": "遇见你丨\"00后\"农机手\"火口夺粮\"，一起来认识这位热心肠的\"麦田守望者\"_民声频道_央视网(cctv.com)",
    "text": "危急时刻 冲进火海抢收小麦！\n前不久，湖北天门一村庄的麦田因焚烧秸秆意外起火，40亩成熟待收的小麦陷入火海。危急时刻，一名年轻的农机手挺身而出，驾驶着收割机冲进熊熊燃烧的麦田，争分夺秒抢救那些即将被大火吞噬的小麦。\n在浓烟中他抢收20多分钟，以打隔离带的方式阻断火情，最终成功抢救下22亩小麦。这位勇敢的农机手，就是来自河南确山县的00后小伙——王振豪。一起来认识这位“火口夺粮”的农机手。\n抢救失火麦田后，王振豪继续北上作业。再次见到他，是在河北邯郸曲周县的一片麦田里。\n王振豪：从早上到现在差不多收了有五六十亩吧，因为刚才上一家的已经割完了，然后这一家的他还没有来，趁这点时间就是下来检查一下机器，看有没有需要保养的。\n王振豪25岁，河南确山县人，从事农机收割工作已经5年了。今年5月，他随收割队在湖北收小麦。听到着火这事儿的时候，他本来正要去吃午饭。\n王振豪：当时就是我在其他地方干完活，然后去街上，有个大哥很着急找到我，他说有麦子着火了，问我能不能帮忙割一下，当时我什么也没想，就开着收割机直接往地里面走。\n王振豪：到地里面以后，我看到那个火当时很大，也想不出更好的办法，把那个没被火烧和被火烧的就是中间隔一条路，就是打隔离带。\n风助火势，从北向南，一路蔓延。王振豪把这个情形看在眼里，果断驾驶收割机靠近大火位置，从北向南快速收割，以此打隔离带阻断火情。\n王振豪：我也是农民的孩子，家里也是种地的，农民种地也挺不容易，看到一大片麦子被烧了，感觉他们一年的辛苦就白费了。就想着赶紧把没烧掉的麦子给收完，能少一点损失。\n据王振豪说，当时现场还有一些村民，有的打报警电话，有开来三轮车，帮着卸下王振豪抢收的麦子。\n王振豪：当时我把油门开到了最大，就怕收割的速度赶不上火烧的速度，当时我也离大火很近，就是想着能多抢收一点。驾驶舱里的温度特别高，得有40℃以上。\n王振豪紧急收割了20多分钟后，消防队员赶到现场，迅速将火扑灭，最终成功抢救下22亩小麦。\n王振豪父亲 王华：既然咱遇到了，咱就得尽这个责任去救。我感觉就是小孩儿做一件好事，我也高兴。\n热心肠的“麦田守望者”\n王振豪在湖北天门救火的视频在网上传播开来后，让他备受关注。网友们纷纷为这位00后的勇敢点赞，而他却说：“他只是做了该做的事”。\n冒险冲进火海抢收粮食，对于从小在农村长大的王振豪来说，几乎是本能。他心疼那些粮食、也特别理解农民的辛苦。而热心肠的王振豪，也总是乐于助人。\n炎炎酷夏，烈日当空，开收割机的时候，王振豪总是顾不上喝水。一天下来，人经常忙得灰头土脸。从小王振豪就对收割机感兴趣，长大后，他就跟着父亲和哥哥学习农机操作。\n王振豪：刚开始接触收割机的时候，对它很陌生，那些操作、性能等什么都不了解，然后我哥就批评我，就对我很严厉。不管是收麦子还是收水稻啊、收玉米，他都会跟我讲怎么去收它们，日复一日，我慢慢也就学会了操作。\n2018年，王振豪买了一台收割机，开始承接周边地区的收割业务，正式成为一名农机手。\n河北省邯郸市曲周县段庄村村民 段如晓：去年就是王师傅来我们家收麦子，收麦子还挺好的，割得挺平整的。感觉他这个人特别好，热心肠。\n在农村长大的王振豪特别理解农民的辛苦。能帮一点就帮一点，在他看来，既是自己力所能及的事，也是一种自然而然的习惯。\n王振豪：去那个村里割水稻一天，到晚上下班的时候，我就看到有一对年迈的爷爷奶奶，他们拿着镰刀在地里割水稻，我就跟他们讲，我说奶奶你不用割了，我免费帮你割，然后给你送回家，当时她也很高兴。\n王振豪妻子 刘冬梅：他是个特别实在的一个人，不管对家人邻居，还是在外面不认识的人，只要是看到别人有困难，能帮的他都会去帮。\n6月初，正是小麦收割的关键时期，王振豪驾驶着收割机在田间地头来回穿梭，卸下一车又一车的小麦。如今，25 岁的王振豪已是两位孩子的父亲，他希望通过自己的努力，让家人过上更好的生活。\n王振豪：我发现做这行挺有成就感的，因为我能通过收割粮食获得他们的赞赏与认可。守护粮食，做到颗粒归仓，慢慢地我就很有动力，就一直坚持下来。\n胆大心细一把好手 助人为乐一片真诚\n都说“十万火急”，可火场中的王振豪不急更不慌，视频中有个细节，他先是驾驶收割机沿着火线打隔离带，再顺着隔离带外沿往回开，扩大隔离带面积。人是00后，事干得可真是专业加漂亮，尤其是面对突发情况，胆大又心细。他这台农机也是个多功能机，遇上火情是救火机，免费给老人割水稻是助人机。王振豪心里装着自个儿的小家，也装着农村的大家，眼里有多少对美好未来的期待，就有多少助人为乐的热忱。这样的棒小伙儿，还得是河南话那个字儿：中！",

    "title": "Biden in hot water with AOC: ‘It’s wrong. It’s not okay.’",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is in hot water with the progressive wing of his party over his new, tough-on-migrant border policy.\n\"I think it's a profound disappointment,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told\nRaw Story after voting on the House floor Wednesday.\nBiden’s\nnew executive order will force asylum seekers to be turned back at the border whenever the seven-day average for migrant encounters — an unscientific measurement that sometimes double or triple counts asylum seekers — tops 2,500 between entry points.\nWith immigration\nfirmly on voters' minds, AOC and other progressives are questioning why Biden seems to be borrowing a play from former President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant playbook.\nALSO READ:\n‘Journalistic dystopian nightmare’: Inside a Tennessee college media meltdown\n“It’s wrong. It’s not okay,” said Ocasio-Cortez, who has endorsed Biden in his reelection bid. “I think what we need to do is support a natural path to citizenship and the resources necessary.”\nIt’s not just AOC and her fellow\nso-called “Squad” members up in arms this time. This week, the American Civil Liberties Union announced it’s challenging Biden’s executive order in court, just as it did under then-President Trump.\n“The Biden administration just announced an executive order that will severely restrict people’s legal right to seek asylum, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk,” the ACLU tweeted on X. “This action takes the same approach as the Trump administration’s asylum ban. We will be challenging this order in court.”\nBREAKING: The Biden administration just announced an executive order that will severely restrict people's legal right to seek asylum, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk.\nThis action takes the same approach as the Trump administration's asylum ban. We will be challenging…\n— ACLU (@ACLU)\n[June 4, 2024]\nBiden took the bait laid out by the conservative messaging machine, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n“I think it’s a mistake, what he's doing,” Jayapal told reporters on the Capitol steps Wednesday. “I think it's using tools — and I want to be clear that Joe Biden is significantly different from Donald Trump — but he’s using tools that Donald Trump used and that we all spoke out against.”\nProgressives are banking on the courts overturning the measure, but they complain Biden’s White House has now caved to the far-right.\n“I think this will be declared unconstitutional, just as Trump's was when he tried to do the same thing, but it's troubling that our Democratic president and some Democrats are endorsing this strategy. It's not going to fix things at the border,” Jayapal said. “You can't fix things because to fix things, you need legal pathways and you need resources. You need to modernize the system, which Republicans have refused to do over and over again.”\nALSO READ:\nTexas AG Ken Paxton campaign ad mistakenly implicates Donald Trump\nJayapal is questioning why their party’s standard-bearer ceded this issue to the GOP, especially after Republicans — at Trump’s behest — walked away from a bipartisan Senate immigration reform package earlier this Congress.\n“We need to talk to the American people, because I don’t think that they, despite all the badgering from many Republicans, I think the American people actually want immigrants here. They just want an orderly process, which we all want. So we need to talk about our vision,” Jayapal said. “And it needs to be very different from Republicans.”\nMore moderate Democrats are defending Biden in the face of the withering criticisms he’s facing from the far-left of the party.\n“The president's promise was that he was going to present an immigration reform bill to the Congress that would be comprehensive, and that's what he did. He did that in the very first piece of legislation on his first day,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said just off the House floor Wednesday. “His intention is a broad immigration reform package. That's getting nowhere. We've been pushing that for years, with no support in the Republican conference.”\nRep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) speaks outside the U.S. Capitol on December 13, 2023 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nAfter Republicans walked, the president still moved forward with some of the policies being pushed by the far-right, which is infuriating progressives.\n“Isn't he caving to Fox News talking points?”\nRaw Story asked.\n“No. I think he's trying to address half the issue — the half of the issue that he is able to address. He needs to address the other piece of it,” Garcia told Raw Story of the push for broader immigration reforms. “I am hopeful through my conversations with the White House that there's more action coming.”\nDemocrats still want immigration-related measures such as a pathway to citizenship for otherwise law-abiding people living in United States illegally and dealing with so-called “Dreamers” — children brought to America illegally and who, in many cases, have lived here most of their lives.\nALSO READ:\n8 ways convicted felon Donald Trump doesn't become president\nAlso on the agenda: a variety of guest worker programs, variety of other opportunities,” Garcia said. “We do have a major challenge to address. He's trying to address this. We’ve got to address the other half. Just addressing border security is not going to solve the challenge.”\nWithout Republican buy-in, Garcia says to expect more action from Biden on immigration in the coming months, as he and Trump get closer and closer to Election Day.\n“What I can say is there are other executive orders that I think the White House is assessing,” Garcia said.\nIt’s unclear if those actions will be enough for the younger, energetic progressive wing of the party.\nWhen it comes to Gen Z voters, Ocasio-Cortez has a simple message — one she and other progressives hope reverberates all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.\n“I’m profoundly disappointed by it,” AOC told Raw Story.\nAnaBelle Elliott and Caroline Pierce contributed to this report.",
