    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic archdiocese is marking Easter with a commitment towards reconciliation with First Nations in B.C., Archbishop J. Michael Miller says.\nThe church and the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced Thursday that a \"Sacred Covenant\" agreement has been reached between the church and the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C.\nThe covenant comes three years after the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., announced the discovery of what it believed were the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school.\nMiller said the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C.\n\"Unquestionably, the church was wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for many children, families and communities. We recognize as Catholics, as the Catholic Church, our part in the resulting tragedies,\" Miller said.\nThe covenant is set to be signed on Easter Sunday, \"a special time of hope and renewal,\" Miller said.\n\"Easter Sunday is the ideal time to help start a new chapter in First Nation and Catholic relations in our province,\" he said. \"Our hope and our prayer is that by taking this next step, we will build on our relationship, a relationship already established but still young, and be an example to Canadian society of respecting the identity and the experience of Indigenous Peoples.\"\nChief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc said the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing.\nCasimir said the agreement is crucial to learning the truth about what happened to the missing children, and access to the church's historical records will help \"bring justice to the children who never made it home.\"\n\"We seek to memorialize the missing children. We also seek meaningful ways to support survivors and intergenerational survivors on their healing journey so that they and their future generations may thrive,\" she said.\nThe nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found 200 potential unmarked burial sites.\nSince then, First Nations across the country have conducted searches and made similar discoveries.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified at least 6,000 deaths at residential schools during their time in operation in Canada between the late 1800s and 1996.\nIn many of the deaths, schools didn’t record the children's names, genders or cause of death.\nThe children in the schools were separated from their families and forbidden to speak their own language. They were undernourished and often experienced physical and sexual abuse.\nThe agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and offering \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school.\nCasimir said the possible excavation of the Kamloops school site has not begun as it's a \"very sensitive step moving forward,\" that involves work with other nations, survivors and their families.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "If you’re pressed for time, can’t cook, or want a sous chef that doesn’t bite back, the world’s smallest, smartest kitchen might just be your next culinary bestie. Meet the TM7, Thermomix’s shiny new all-in-one kitchen device.\nPhotograph: Thermomix But forget admiring it online – you can now experience the TM7 in the flesh at Thermomix’s first experience store in Singapore. You’ll find it on the second floor (#02-07/08) of the newly revamped The Cathay – a bright, open space with floor-to-ceiling windows, cooking stations, and a neat layout that makes exploring a breeze.\nWe popped in for a live demo and got a proper look at what the TM7 can do. It’s sleeker and quieter than the previous model, with a bigger, more responsive multi-touch display. It connects directly to Cookidoo, Thermomix’s recipe platform, giving you access to over 100,000 guided recipes right from the screen – think smartphone, but for your kitchen.\nPhotograph: Thermomix What really impressed us? It replaces over 20 kitchen appliances, saving you both space and money. Plus, with its multi-layer cooking function, you can prepare entire meals – like soup, rice, and a meat dish – at the same time. The stainless steel bowl even has an integrated heating system, temperature sensors and an insulation cover so it stays cool to the touch, even when its contents are piping hot.\nIn under two hours, we whipped up fresh lemonade and mango sorbet in less than three minutes, followed by hot mushroom soup and stir-fried veggies in under 10. We even baked homemade focaccia with a little help from the oven. The TM7 crushed ice, squeezed lemons, browned vegetables, kneaded dough and even cleaned itself, leaving us free to set the table.\nPhotograph: Thermomix With Guided Cooking, the TM7 walks you through every step of a recipe – so even if you’ve never cooked before, it’s almost impossible to mess up. For experienced cooks, it’s a chance to explore new techniques and tackle recipes you might not have tried otherwise. It’s a total game-changer for time-starved working professionals, busy parents juggling dinner and homework, or anyone who just wants to put a wholesome meal on the table without the stress.\nCan’t wait to get your hands on the TM7? You can get yours now for $2,980, including free shipping to your doorstep.\nPhotograph: Thermomix But if you prefer to try before you buy, the Thermomix experience store also hosts thematic cooking classes. Each two-hour session offers hands-on experience with the TM7, plus useful tips and tricks that go beyond the manual. The best part? They’re all free. Just book in advance here as slots are limited and fill up fast. It’s the best way to see the TM7 in action before making it part of your kitchen routine. Discover more here .",

    "title": "The Sicilian Region switches to the single treasury system. Schifani and Falcone: “Historical turning point, less bureaucracy and more certainty in the accounts”",
    "text": "From January 1, 2024, the Sicilian Region, in the accounting field, will definitively abandon the current cash regime to adopt the economic management system through a single treasury. An adaptation provided for by the national regulations on the matter, already in force in several other Italian regions, which will mark a turning point in terms of simplification for citizens, acceleration of payments and streamlining of accounting procedures for offices. Unicredit will become the treasurer institution of the Region, ensuring the delicate transition between the two regimes. Over the last year, the Budget and Treasury department has managed the transition with the support of Arit (the regional authority for technological innovation), through first of all the implementation of the Score accounting platform (new regional accounting system) to which will be accompanied by the complete adoption of the national PagoPa payments system. «Since our inauguration – states the president of the Region Renato Schifani – we are working to innovate the regional administrative machine, bringing it up to speed with the needs of Sicilians. The adoption of the Single Treasury system marks a crucial leap towards the digitalisation of processes and the simplification of the PA, in the interest of citizens and businesses, but also to allow our offices to work at their best”. «For several years – explains the Economic Councilor Marco Falcone – Sicily has operated by extending the old cash system which today, finally, we are sending to the attic together with a whole series of accounting procedures, mostly paper-based, very burdensome for the Accounting Office and for all regional structures. For example, the old-fashioned paper receipts that, until now, our offices had to endorse for each payment will disappear. The single treasury will simplify the management and alignment of income and expenditure, reducing bureaucratic steps and speeding up payments and assessments. Thus, we also follow the dictates of the Court of Auditors, with the aim of reaching the next equalization having already started the optimization of cash flows, in the name of accounting certainty. Thanks – concludes Falcone – to the general accountant Ignazio Tozzo and to the offices in via Notarbartolo, as well as to Arit and to the director Vitalba Vaccaro for the commitment and effort aimed at streamlining administrative procedures for the benefit of offices, citizens and the entire Region” . In detail, the new single treasury system will allow the Region to directly manage its banking provisions through the Score system, in conjunction with Unicredit. The result is a clear streamlining of payment and collection procedures, to the benefit of both the citizen and the administrative organization of the Accounting Office and the various Departments of the Region. The accounting reconciliation of payments, until now processed and charged individually, is simplified and automated, abolishing receipts and also facilitating the differentiation between the flows of the “Estate” treasury account and the “Health” treasury account. The transition to the Single Treasury and the adoption of the PagoPa system will allow the debtor and payment to be linked immediately. From January 1st, the operation of the 23 postal current accounts in the Region currently in use for the public will be suspended. Instead, new ordinary treasury accounts will be opened at Unicredit at the following Ibans, which can be used by public bodies operating under the single national treasury regime: Iban Bankit Revenue IT51E 01000 03245 515300305982 – Iban Bankit Sanità IT45H 01000 03245 515300306694. For the types of payments not conveyed through the national PagoPa platform, each regional Department will use specific sub-accounts, the related IBANs of which will soon be available on the Region’s institutional website. For citizens and businesses, the transition to the Single Treasury will mean greater simplification of payments and less waiting for settlements. The PagoPa system will be available to users, already usable for dozens of other operations with public administrations. Payments will still be possible through post office counters, alongside the options of betting shops and tobacconists, via smartphone and online for taxes such as car tax or taxes on government concessions.",

    "text": "ROME — A Catholic parish in southern Italy has exhibited a Nativity scene featuring the Virgin Mary together with another woman in place of Saint Joseph.\nFather Vitaliano Della Sala, the pastor of the parish of Saints Peter and Paul in the southern province of Avellino, said he created the provocative crèche scene to underscore the changing shape of families and the need for a more inclusive Church.\nI placed “two mothers in the crèche,” Father Della Sala wrote on Facebook. “This year I see the light of Christmas also shining on these families affected by inhuman and anti-evangelical criticism and condemnation.”\nThere are “so many ways of being a family” because “nothing is impossible with God!” he said.\nThe decision to give Jesus two mothers drew sharp reactions from Catholics in Italy, including from Father Maurizio Patriciello, a pastor from the neighboring province of Naples, who called on Father Della Sala to apologize and put Saint Joseph back “in his place” to which he is entitled “by right.”\nIn Father Della Sala’s Facebook post, he lamented “the contempt for ‘rainbow families’ and their condemnation, even on the part of sectors of the Catholic Church, without a serious and honest discussion and confrontation.”\n“Exclusion has traced a red trail of blood and pain throughout history,” he declared.\n“The very logic of inclusiveness is the future of the Church,” he stated, “a Church that does not marginalize, does not use the heavy axe of judgment against anyone.”\nFather Della Sala’s post came just a day after the Vatican authorized priests for the first time to bless gay couples under certain circumstances.\nThat decision, too, has drawn extensive criticism, even from the former head of the Vatican’s doctrinal office, Cardinal Gerhard Müller.\nThe choice to allow priests to bless gay couples constitutes “not a development but a doctrinal leap,” Cardinal Müller said , which is unsupported by any biblical texts or texts of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church.\n“In fact, according to the criterion of this type of blessings, one could even bless an abortion clinic or a mafia group,” the cardinal wrote.\nIt seems that the innovative pastoral blessing “is created ad hoc to bless situations that are contrary to the law or spirit of the gospel,” he added.\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome\nFaith London / Europe Politics Catholic Church Italy lesbian LGBT Nativity Scene Vatican",

    "text": "Georges Pelletier, 73 ans, aurait été tué sur un terrain privé à Sainte-Luce le 16 juin 2023. (Photo d'archives) Photo : Radio-Canada / Jean-Luc Blanchet À près d'un an d'une mort suspecte survenue à Sainte-Luce, la Sûreté du Québec (SQ) sollicite à nouveau l'aide de la population pour élucider cette affaire. Pour la première fois, le corps policier dit croire que la victime, Georges Pelletier, pourrait avoir été victime d'un homicide. L'homme de 73 ans a été retrouvé inanimé le 16 juin 2023 sur un terrain privé en bordure de la route du Fleuve Ouest. Aussitôt, la mort de l'individu de Rimouski a été classée comme suspecte par le corps policier. Le corps de la victime présentait des marques de violence , dont certaines étaient plus évidentes au niveau de la tête, selon nos informations. Les études balistiques menées par les enquêteurs ont indiqué que Georges Pelletier a été atteint par un projectile, rapportait Radio-Canada deux mois après les événements. Georges Pelletier a été retrouvé sans vie le 16 juin dernier à Sainte-Luce. Photo : (Facebook) La Sûreté du Québec ne confirme aucune thèse, mais assure que l'enquête se poursuit. Plusieurs éléments ont été enquêtés, plusieurs pistes ont été enquêtées, se contente d'affirmer Frédéric Deshaies, porte-parole de la SQ. Toute personne qui détiendrait de l'information ou qui aurait été témoin de l'événement est invitée à contacter la Centrale de l'information criminelle de la Sûreté du Québec au 1 800 659-4264. L'information qui est donnée est confidentielle et il n'y a aucune obligation pour la personne qui appelle de s'impliquer au dossier, ajoute l'agent d'information de la SQ.",
