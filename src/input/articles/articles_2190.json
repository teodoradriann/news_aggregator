    "text": "(CNN) — His face has become instantly recognizable around the world: A red-haired baby boy holding a pink elephant toy, looking directly into the camera with a toothless smile.\nHis name is Kfir Bibas, and he is the youngest of the 253 hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups during the terror attacks against Israel on October 7.\nOn Thursday, Kfir turns one — if he is still alive.\nThe baby boy was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel alongside his parents Yarden and Shiri, and his four-year old brother Ariel.\nHis family held an event in Tel Aviv on Thursday, commemorating what they called “the saddest birthday in the world.”\nLarge crowd of people filled the square in central Tel Aviv that has become known as the “Hostages Plaza.” Many were holding orange balloons, a nod to Kfir’s red hair. A large screen displaying the number of days the hostages have been held in Gaza stood nearby - 103.\nPeople are also reading…\nOn Tuesday, a smaller group of friends and relatives of the Bibas family held an event at Nir Oz on Tuesday, commemorating Kfir’s birthday with a large balloon display and a cake featuring the famous photo of Kfir with the pink elephant.\nThe same picture was propped up next to Israel’s President Israeli Isaac Herzog when he spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n“Kfir Bibas is not the enemy of the Hamas. The Hamas don’t have any rules,” Jimmy Miller, cousin of the Bibas family, told CNN on Wednesday.\n“You know, any rules even from the Quran because in the Quran, you cannot do damage to kids … so Hamas breaks all the rules of the Islam,” he added.\nIt is not clear whether Kfir and his family are still alive. The two boys and their mother were\nnot released from Gaza during the temporary truce in late November, despite the fact that the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas called for all women and children to be set free.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said at that time they believed the family was being held hostage by other militia groups and not by Hamas.\nHowever, later that week, Hamas said, without providing any evidence, that Kfir, his brother and his mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nThe IDF said at that time the it was assessing the claim. Asked on Thursday whether there was any conclusion in that investigation, a spokesperson told CNN: “The IDF has no comment.”\nA few days after making the claim that the family were dead, Hamas released a video of Yarden Bibas, Kfir’s father, in which he blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the death of his wife and two children. Bibas appeared to be in extreme distress in the video and was very likely speaking under duress.\nThe IDF called the video a “cruel act of psychological terror which Hamas is using against families of hostages.”\nIsrael believes 253 hostages were taken into Gaza during the Hamas attack on October 7. Following hostage releases and one rescue, the Prime Minister’s Office says 132 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 105 are alive and 27 dead.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "The Myth of Christianity's 'Socialist Roots' - Foundation for Economic Education",
    "text": "Nearly two millennia ago, some of the earliest followers of Christ in Jerusalem arranged their affairs in a way that still prompts the claim that Christianity’s roots are socialist, communal, or even “communist.” When we celebrate the birth of Jesus, we should understand that this claim is spurious, if not blasphemous. Its sources are two passages in the New Testament’s Book of Acts, [chapter 2, verses 44–45](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202%3A44-45&version=NIV), which states: “All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.” [Acts 4:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A32&version=NIV) declares: “All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.” Many on the left argue that Christian teaching should spurn private property and endorse a socialist system of wealth redistribution. After all, isn’t that what those early Christians did? Take a closer look at those passages in Acts. The “communal” arrangement was voluntary. There is no compulsion and no mention of the one institution in society that can employ compulsion legally, namely, the state. [Acts 2:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A46&version=NIV) notes that this group of early Christians “broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts” [emphasis added]. If they still possessed homes, some, at least, clearly did not sell everything. Those who did brought the cash from their sales to the apostles, not to any government — Roman or Jewish, secular or religious. Christians see God as the creator of all things and, therefore, as the owner of all things. Humans are stewards of Creation, and we are called by Scripture to put it to good use. It’s likely in this transcendent sense that some early Christians thought of their material wealth as not ultimately their own. In any event, [socialism](https://fee.org/resources/the-xyz-s-of-socialism/) is not the voluntary sharing of one’s possessions. Anyone can choose to do that under socialism’s antithesis, capitalism. Indeed, more philanthropy occurs in capitalist societies than in socialist ones, and the governments of capitalist countries are constantly sending “foreign aid” to the more socialist regimes, not the other way around. Socialism is more properly understood as the concentration of political power for the purposes — through force — of redistributing wealth or planning an economy. Moreover, its sorry track record begins with those early Christians who chose to practice it. The apostle Paul first alludes to financial problems among the Jerusalem group when he describes a conversation he had with its leaders — Peter, James, and John. Paul says, “All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor,” which Paul was “eager to do” ( [Galatians 2:9–10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2%3A9-10&version=NIV)). Apparently, the Jerusalem church was at the top of the “poor” list because Paul followed his request from Peter, James, and John by collecting money from the newer Christian churches in Antioch, Macedonia, and Corinth to send to “the poor among the saints in Jerusalem” ( [Romans 15:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15%3A26&version=NIV)) In other words, subsidies from Christians in Antioch, Macedonia, and Corinth were helping prop up the impoverished Jerusalem church. And some of these gift-giving Christians had almost nothing to live on, let alone give. For example, Paul describes how the Macedonian Christians were in “extreme poverty” and yet “gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability.” ( [2 Corinthians 8:2–3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+8%3A2%E2%80%933&version=NIV)). How desperate must the Christians in Jerusalem have been to rely on Christian brothers and sisters living in such “extreme poverty”? One cannot doubt the sincerity of the communalists, but one can certainly question how well they understood some of Christ’s teachings. Only once did Jesus ever command anyone to sell everything, and that was when a rich ruler inquired how he could secure eternal life. To demonstrate where the man’s heart really was (which Jesus surely knew), Jesus told him to sell everything. The ruler refused and walked away. Jesus never suggested that everybody should sell everything, and he certainly never endorsed socialist, state-directed coercion to accomplish that. Indeed, in his [parable of the talents](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A14-30&version=ESV), Jesus reserves the highest praise for the man whose initiative magnified material wealth, and no praise at all for the man who did nothing to create value. His [parable of the workers in the vineyard](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2020%3A1-16&version=NIV) provides a powerful defense of voluntary contract and private property, and his [parable of the Good Samaritan](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A25-37&version=NIV) ennobles the man who helps another from his own resources and his own free will. If that Samaritan had told the desperate victim at the side of the road, “Wait for the government to show up and help you,” we would likely know him today as the “Good-for-Nothing Samaritan.” The fact is that though some early Christians arranged their affairs in a “communal” way, most did not. In the 20 centuries since, few Christians have chosen the communal path, and most who did rejected it when it inevitably failed. The Pilgrims of Plymouth, for instance, starved until [Gov. William Bradford embraced private property](https://spectator.org/the-pilgrims-gift-of-freedom-something-to-celebrate-on-thanksgiving/). Utopian socialist experiments in 19th-century America, numbering more than 100 and often inspired by erroneous views of Christian ethics, all expired within a few years. Imagine if Jesus returned today and spoke to a packed audience at Carnegie Hall, asking, “What did you do to help the poor?” Only the shallow or misguided could say he would be impressed if someone raised his hand and declared, “I voted for the politicians who said they would take care of that.” Rather than take their cue from Bernie Sanders, Karl Marx, or even those early Jerusalem communalists, Christians and non-Christians alike ought to remember what the apostle Paul says in [2 Corinthians 9:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A7&version=NIV): “Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”",

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nSu nombre desvela sus orígenes. La actriz Mirela Balić nació en Madrid en 1998, pero tiene raíces serbias y croatas. «Vivo en Vallecas, eh», presumía ante David Broncano. Y aprovechó en 'La Revuelta' para reivindicar que «todo el mundo» pronuncia mal su nombre y apellido. Con alguna pequeña lección de serbio, explicó a Broncano el orden de los apellidos en esa cultura y cómo tiene «cosas de los dos países» que hacen gracia a su parte materna y paterna. «No se te da mal el idioma», elogiaba la invitada.\nConocida por su papel en series como 'Élite' o 'Cristo y Rey', la actriz acudió para promocionar la película 'Mala influencia', dirigida por Chloé Wallace. Cumplió con la tradición de regalar algo a Broncano. «En la 'peli' soy chunga, por eso te traigo una moto de juguete de chunga». El segundo regalo fue más conflictivo: un tatuaje de 'macarrilla' de un escorpión. «No puedes decir que no». Una afirmación que el humorista puso en duda a pesar de que la intérprete Clara Galle se tatuó la 'R' de su programa. Había truco. En su caso, era más fácil porque se trataba de una calcamonía especial que se utiliza en los equipos de maquillaje en los rodajes. Se puede quitar fácilmente con alcohol.\nDespués de esto, Broncano es capaz de aparecer el lunes con 7 tatuajes, dos de ellos en la cara y otro en el cuello.\n— La Revuelta (@LaRevuelta_TVE)[#LaRevuelta][pic.twitter.com/f6tj55r2tP][January 23, 2025]\nBalić disfrutó bailando una improvisación del beatbox de Grison. «Tengo varios familiares que son músicos». Y se enfrentó a las preguntas clásicas. «Estoy preparada». ¿Dinero en el banco? «Me gustaría tener más. El año que viene dar la entrada para un piso, pero nunca es un buen momento... Cada vez está más caro. Todo el patrimonio no te puedo decir, porque lo lleva mi suegra», se escudaba. «¿Y lleva las cuentas de la otra pregunta?», recogía Broncano. La actriz reconocía que con ella «hablo de todo». «Tengo una relación sana y satisfactoria. Follar, follo. Que he tenido otras relaciones que... ¿Y tú?». Ambos coincidieron en que es «divertido». «Ahora voy al gimnasio y lo notó mucho follando», contaba la invitada. «Se nota, eh. Si no, se te sube el gemelo. Un tirón en el cuello, la cadera...», respondía su anfitrión.\nAntes apareció una invitada sorpresa. Chelo García-Cortés entró en 'La Revuelta' regalando piropos. «Qué guapo eres», le soltó a David Broncano. Hasta le olió. «Hueles bien». Y ahí se dio cuenta que sobre la mesa había un retrato de una vieja compañera de 'Sálvame'. «¡Mira! Ahí está Belén». «Estoy tan contenta de estar aquí... sois todos tan jóvenes».\n— La Revuelta (@LaRevuelta_TVE)[January 23, 2025]\nNo llevó regalo alguno para el presentador. Defendió que ella misma era el regalo del espacio de colaboración de Jorge Ponce. «Te traeré una foto de Bárbara y mía». Ella sí tuvo obsequio de Jorge Ponce. Y se colocó por encima del pantalón unas bragas al revés. Y se fue con otro más: una botella de limoncello.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nEsta funcionalidad es exclusiva para suscriptores.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "title": "Bassitt says everyone to blame as Jays' shoddy season worsens with 13-0 loss to Rays",
    "text": "TORONTO — Chris Bassitt declared everyone in the Toronto Blue Jays organization should bear the blame for its shoddy season.\nBassitt (8-9) made his remarks after the Tampa Bay Rays (52-51) throttled the Blue Jays (46-56) 13-0 with 16 hits in the rubber match of their three-game series on Thursday.\n“I would say there’s not a single person in probably the whole organization who's not disappointed right now,\" Bassitt said.\n“It just sucks. I don’t think anyone thought this is what was going to happen.\n“I don’t think there’s one person with clean hands right now. I really don’t think we’ve done anything well this year. Well, maybe (Daulton) Varsho’s defence.\n“Besides Varsho’s defence, I don’t see how anyone can say ‘I’ve done what I should.'\"\nBassitt also remarked that the embarrassing loss was because the team has been fighting \"demons.\"\nWhat did he mean?\n“Everything that’s been going on,\" Bassitt said.\n\"It’s whatever it might be, giving up that many hits, not being able to hit and the trade deadline. Who’s going to be here, who’s not going to be here? There’s a million different things right now that are just not great.\"\nWith the trade deadline five days away, and the Blue Jays not meeting expectations of contending, the assumptions have been general manager Ross Atkins will sell off a handful of veteran players in exchange for prospects.\n“You have ideas of who’s not going to be around much longer and a lot of these people mean a lot to you so yeah, it’s not fun,\" Bassitt said.\nBassitt admitted he wasn't sharp before 41,148 at Rogers Centre. He departed after five innings down 3-0 after tossing 97 pitches, giving up five hits and a walk with six strikeouts.\nBut then reliever Trevor Richards entered and was worse. He only faced seven hitters, giving up four runs on four hits and two walks.\n“He’s been really good for us, especially earlier in the year,\" Blue Jays manager John Scheider said of Richards. \"But he doesn’t have a good feel for his change-up right now.\n\"When you have two pitches you have to be good with them. He doesn’t have his command right now and he’s falling behind (in the count).”\nTampa followed its four-run sixth inning by tacking on five more in the seventh.\nErnie Clement and his knuckleball had to be summoned from his third-base position to pitch the ninth and save the bullpen from further depletion. He gave up a run as the Rays pushed their hit total to 16.\nTaj Bradley (6-4) pitched six shutout innings and allowed only two hits, winning his third straight start.\nThe 23-year-old Bradley surrendered a one-out double to left from Spencer Horwitz and an infield hit to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the first inning.\nBut then the Rays righty settled down to retire 11 in a row and 17 of his final 18, allowing only a walk to Danny Jansen in the fifth. Bradley finished with seven strikeouts and a walk.\nBrandon Lowe, Isaac Paredes, Alex Jackson and Amed Rosario were the big offensive producers in the series finale before 41,148 at Rogers Centre.\nLowe sent a 414-foot homer into the fifth deck down the right-field line to open the scoring. He knocked in two more runs with four hits and also twice walked.\nParedes drove in four runs with two hits, while Jackson checked in with three RBI with two hits. Rosario pounded a double and two singles.\nON THE MEND\nBlue Jays utility infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa (sprained left knee) could begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday, provided there are no setbacks, according to Schneider.\nKiner-Falefa has been out since July 1 and has enjoyed a solid season with a .292 average and .338 on-base percentage.\nON DECK\nThe Blue Jays begin a three-game set against the Texas Rangers on Friday to conclude their nine-outing, 10-day homestand. Toronto's Yusei Kikuchi (4-9) will open the series against lefty Andrew Heaney (4-10).\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.\nTim Wharnsby, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Leah Remini is following in the footsteps of her best friend Jennifer Lopez — by filing for divorce.\nThe actress announced this week that she and husband Angelo Pagan are calling it quits after 21 years of marriage.\nLeah shared the surprising news with fans on her Instagram page Thursday evening.\nLeah Remini, recipient of the Impact Award, poses in the press room during the Critics’ Choice Real TV Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on June 02, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images) Leah Remini Announces Divorce From Angelo Pagan “Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce,” Leah wrote alongside a pair of photos of herself and Angelo.\nShe went on to reveal that the decision to split was an amicable and mutual one.\nShe also noted that she and Angelo plan to remain close friends. The situation reminded many of the “conscious uncoupling” approach favored by stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin.\nLeah Remini takes part in SiriusXM’s Town Hall with the cast of ‘Second Act’ hosted by Andy Cohen at SiriusXM Studios on December 12, 2018 in New York City. (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM) “To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore,” Leah wrote, adding:\n“After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today. Our bond is still strong—it’s just evolved into something different.”\n“But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.\n“We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships—whether they change or end—aren’t failures. We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter.”\nLeah Remini attends the world premiere of “Second Act” at Regal Union Square Theatre, Stadium 14 on December 12, 2018 in New York City.

(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP)\nLeah’s followers were obviously saddened by the news of her split, but most were supportive in their comments.\n“Why does this one make me so sad? I just loved watching your whole family on your reality show. My love to you all,” one user wrote.\n“I wish you both all the best. Moving forward for both of you, your number 1 priority is your daughter,” another one added.\nLeah Remini attends the 2019 Creative Arts Emmy Awards on September 14, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

Sending love and strength as you navigate these new waters!”\nWe’ve seen a lot of celebrity divorces this year, but few caught us by surprise quite as much as this one.\nWe wish Leah and Angelo all the best as they figure out this new stage in their lives.",
