    "title": "Rio Tinto and Edify Energy sign landmark solar and battery agreement for Rio Tinto's Gladstone operations | User | malvern-online.com",
    "text": "Rio Tinto and Edify Energy have signed two new solar and battery hybrid services agreements (HSAs) to increase the supply of reliable, competitively priced electricity to Rio Tinto’s Gladstone aluminium operations in Queensland.\nUnder the agreements, Rio Tinto will purchase 90% of the power and battery storage capacity generated by the Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations for 20 years. Edify Energy will build, own, and operate the projects, with construction due to begin in late 2025 and targeting completion in 2028.\nLocated in Central Queensland, the adjacent Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations, will together feature 600MWac1 of solar and 600MW / 2,400MWh of battery storage.\nRio Tinto Chief Executive, Australia, Kellie Parker said: \"These agreements are integral to repowering our Gladstone aluminium operations with affordable, reliable and lower carbon energy for decades to come.\n“For the first time, we have integrated crucial battery storage in our efforts to make the Boyne aluminium smelter globally cost-competitive, as traditional energy sources become more expensive.\n“We continue to investigate further renewable energy investments to repower our Gladstone aluminium operations.”\nEdify Energy Chief Executive, John Cole, acknowledged the importance of this new services agreement in providing clean, reliable and cost-effective electricity to energy consumers.\n“The Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations deliver the latest in solar, battery and inverter technology to support Australia’s power needs.\n“This collaboration is an important commitment to supporting the sustainable future of Australia's industrial sector. We are proud to advance Rio Tinto's goals to repower its Gladstone operations and to play a role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.”\nWhen combined with the 2.2GW of renewable wind and solar PPAs Rio Tinto announced for its Gladstone operations in 2024, the Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap agreements help secure a total of 2.7GW2 of future wind and solar energy in Queensland.\nTogether, the four contracted projects are expected to supply 80% of Boyne smelter’s annual average electricity demand, reducing the smelter’s scope 1 and 2 emissions by 70%3, or 5.6Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. This is the equivalent of removing about 2 million internal combustion engine cars from the road.\nRio Tinto's 90% share of the Smoky Creek & Guthrie's Gap battery system capacity amounts to 2,160MWh, which will provide about 30% of the firming required to repower the Boyne smelter with renewable energy. It will store green energy for reliable use during peak demand periods or low solar output, which will improve stability and resilience of Queensland’s power network.\nRio Tinto's integrated aluminium production chain in Queensland is a significant economic driver for the state and Australia, directly employing over 4500 people and supporting thousands more livelihoods. The company's operations in Gladstone alone account for more than 3000 jobs, with 1000 of those at the Boyne smelter.\nRio Tinto’s three production assets in the Gladstone region are the Boyne aluminium smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland alumina refinery.\nFurther information on the Smoky Creek & Guthrie's Gap Power Station is available\nhere.\n1 The solar farm will have 720MWp (megawatt peak) of installed solar panels – the theoretical maximum potential output– and will deliver 600MWac (megawatts alternating current) of usable power to the grid.\n2 This comprises of the following contracted renewable energy projects: 1.1GW of Windlab’s proposed 1.4GW Bungaban wind project, 1.1GW from European Energy’s proposed Upper Calliope solar farm and 540MW from Edify Energy’s combined 600MW Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations.\n3 5.6Mt CO2e and 70% reduction are on a 100% managed basis.\nView source version on businesswire.com:\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312396623/en/\nContacts\nPlease direct all enquiries to\nmedia.enquiries@riotinto.com\nMedia Relations,\nUnited Kingdom\nDavid Outhwaite\nM +44 7787 597 493\nMedia Relations,\nAustralia\nMatt Chambers\nM +61 433 525 739\nMichelle Lee\nM +61 458 609 322\nRachel Pupazzoni\nM +61 438 875 469\nMedia Relations,\nCanada\nSimon Letendre\nM +1 514 796 4973\nMalika Cherry\nM +1 418 592 7293\nVanessa Damha\nM +1 514 715 2152\nMedia Relations,\nUS\nJesse Riseborough\nM +1 202 394 9480\nInvestor Relations,\nUnited Kingdom\nRachel Arellano\nM: +44 7584 609 644\nDavid Ovington\nM +44 7920 010 978\nLaura Brooks\nM +44 7826 942 797\nWeiwei Hu\nM +44 7825 907 230\nInvestor Relations,\nAustralia\nTom Gallop\nM +61 439 353 948\nAmar Jambaa\nM +61 472 865 948\nRio Tinto plc\n6 St James’s Square\nLondon SW1Y 4AD\nUnited Kingdom\nT +44 20 7781 2000\nRegistered in England\nNo. 719885\nRio Tinto Limited\nLevel 43, 120 Collins Street\nMelbourne 3000\nAustralia\nT +61 3 9283 3333\nRegistered in Australia\nABN 96 004 458 404\nriotinto.com\nCategory:General",

    "title": "News industry off to brutal 2024 start as mass layoffs devastate publishers, raising questions about the future of journalism | Consumer Watch | wsiltv.com",
    "text": "(CNN) — The news industry is enduring a brutal start to the new year, with outlets large and small across the country hemorrhaging reporting staff as legacy business models that kept much of the industry afloat for decades collapse in plain sight.\nThe rapid contraction, coming even as the presidential election cycle heats up and public attention and revenues historically mount, has been on full display this month, with the first few weeks of 2024 ushering in a spate of painful layoffs at news organizations from coast-to-coast.\nThe Los Angeles Times slashed its newsroom by more than 20% earlier this week; TIME cut dozens of staffers; and Business Insider said it would trim its workforce by 8%. Meanwhile, hundreds of staffers at Condé Nast, Forbes, The New York Daily News, and others staged historic walkouts to protest planned cuts at the outlets.\nThe recent round of layoffs, while pronounced, are part of a much larger and unrelenting storm battering the journalism industry. Over the past 18 months, most news organizations have been forced to make difficult decisions to reduce their workforces.\nAt the national level, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, Vice Media, Sports Illustrated, Vox Media, NBC News, CNBC, and other organizations have cut swaths of their reporting staff. At the local level, layoffs have been nearly constant, with newspaper giant Gannett cutting hundreds of employees, and small outlets carving out already lean operations.\nThe latest round of layoffs come after 2023 marked the worst year for job cuts in the journalism sector since Covid-19 upended the world in 2020, with roughly 2,700 jobs eliminated.\nWhile each outlet is struggling with its own unique challenges, they all are facing brutal industry headwinds ushered in by the internet revolution and other technological advances that have fundamentally changed the way the public consumes news and entertainment.\nAudiences that once reliably surfed traditional cable channels and consumed news websites or newspapers are instead absorbing content and spending time on platforms such as TikTok and Netflix, leading to massive declines in ratings and traffic. That shift in behavior has led brands to spend their marketing in emerging digital arenas, particularly given their ability to offer advertisers powerful tools to target audiences with precision.\nMaking matters worse, news outlets have seen their online advertising businesses vanish as social media and search giants devour much of the industry’s dollars. Research produced by Columbia University in October estimated that technology titans Google and Meta should pay news outlets $14 billion per year in revenue for their search traffic and content, a figure it described as “conservative.” But technology companies have resisted paying publishers for their content and launched high-profile fights to block legislation intended to recoup some of the lost revenue.\n“The ad industry doesn’t need the news industry when there are so many other ways to purchase attention, and so many better ways to target users,” Jay Rosen, an associate professor of journalism at New York University, told CNN.\nThe change in behavior has also meant news consumers are canceling subscriptions to newspapers and cable providers, cutting precious revenues even further.\n“I am sorry to say that I do not see turning around most legacy outlets,” Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tow Professor of Journalism Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, told CNN. “Their proprietors, with few exceptions, did not adapt to the internet. They held onto their old business models — advertising, subscription, and the attention economy.”\n“Many of them are now controlled by hedge funds, which will not invest or innovate,” Jarvis said, adding that cost-cutting is the “predictable response to a worsening downward business spiral,” which “will make the products of these publications only worse, which will accelerate the spiral.”\n“The death of newspapers — and magazines and linear TV — has been oft-foretold and has not yet occurred,” Jarvis said. “The fall might be coming now.”\nThe hollowing out of large news institutions comes at a perilous time for America. Antidemocratic candidates have intentionally worked to undermine faith in news outlets as they look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast, attacking those tasked with the duty of holding public officials accountable.\n“To say that trust in the news media has declined is correct, but too vague,” Rosen said. “The reality is that destroying confidence in the practice and products of journalism is a potent and successful political strategy, as with Steve Bannon’s ‘flood the zone.’”\nThat lack of accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the ballot box.\nMargaret Sullivan, a columnist at The Guardian who previously wrote about media for The Washington Post and The New York Times, told CNN in December that she is worried about the larger consequences the deeper cuts in the news business will have on the country. Sullivan said that it is not only “heartbreaking to see the loss of these jobs,” but warned the action will do “damage to society.”\n“The loss of journalists contributes to the exponential growth of news deserts in large swaths of the nation — and that’s disastrous when misinformation is rampant,” Sullivan said. “Democracy needs an informed electorate in order to function and that is tragically dwindling in many regions.”\nFor a time, there had been hope that billionaire ownership of news publications could offer stability to the industry as it wears off legacy business models. Recent months, however, have cast doubt on that optimism, with Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times making significant cuts to their newsrooms.\nBut despite the widespread gloom, there are some encouraging signs popping up across the industry. Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, noted some local news outlets have found financial sustainability.\n“Billionaire newspaper ownership is coming under fire lately because of Soon-Shiong’s fecklessness and because Jeff Bezos has hit a few bumps with the Post, although I think that will prove to be temporary,” Kennedy told CNN, pointing to recent successes at The Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Boston Globe newspapers.\n“There are reasons to be optimistic given the hundreds of independent local news organizations that have sprouted up in recent years,” he said. “The challenge is that coverage at the hyperlocal level is hit or miss, as some communities are well-served and others — especially in rural areas and in urban communities of color — tend to be overlooked.”\nBut Rosen cautioned against the reliance on deep-pocketed philanthropists to sustain journalistic enterprises in the long-term.\n“Journalists have to take it upon themselves to treat sustainability as their problem, but this is not what they signed up for,” he said. “They signed up to do stories.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help.

McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#2](c2#c-2) Borrell es el alto representante de la UE, lo que dice no se debe considerar su opinión sino la postura oficial de la UE, que por supuesto puede ser distinta a la de cada país en concreto.\n[#8](c8#c-8) eso iba a decir yo. Que si se saliera mucho del guión le quitarían ipso facto. Encima de que es español y de vez en cuando cosas como ésta nos lo echamos al cuello. Habría que ver si su puesto estuviera ocupado por González Pons o por un tipo Orban.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Habrá un día en que Borrell condene con acciones esta masacre y denuncie ante los tribunales internacionales, en representación de la UE, los actos genocidas del gobierno de Israel sobre Gaza.\nEntonces ahí sí creeré estas historias para no dormir que cuenta.\nPero seguramente eso nunca ocurrirá porque bien sabe que la UE es cómplice de tal genocidio, y que si se pronunciara de esa manera, su jefa le daría la patada, quedándose el pobre Borrelito sin su puesto tan chulo, molón y prominente.\nNo disfruta ni nada con el protagonismo que tiene.\n[#2](c2#c-2) pero sin tirar cohetes, que parte de dar credibilidad a un estado que funciona como un puto mafioso: extorsión, amenazas, asesinatos y difamación.\n[#2](c2#c-2) No tiene miedo que le pase lo que le pasó a Gaspar Llamazares con el FBI, otros comunistas como Yoli si que tienen miedo (o egoísmo) de ahí su apoyo a la OTAN.\n[#5](c5#c-5) El próximo vas a flipar. Sanciones europeas a todo aquel que insulte al Isra, ques mu güen chaval.\n[#27](c27#c-27) Le quedan unos meses, no hace falta cancelarlo y quedar mal, como si fuéramos unos Vladimires cualquiera. Aquí somos muy democráticos. Se le dice en privado que deje de tocar las pelotas y será mejor para todos y en cuatro mesecillos de nada se pone a otro en el mismo puesto que meta línea dura de apoyo incondicional a Israel con más armamento y más dineros y que condene muy fuerte a Hamás y ya está, arreglao.\nBorrell eclipsando el escándalo de 50.000 millones para ucrania:\nOrbán se rinde y permite a la UE aprobar 50.000 millones de euros en ayudas para Ucrania\nResumen de este envío: Borrell demostrando mayor consistencia moral los zazis de MNM. Lo que tampoco es tan difícil.\nPor supuesto, nunca lo admitirán. Ni ante sí mismos.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Y tu te estas aprovechando de su postura razonable y sensata, apoyando al pueblo indefenso, para atacarlos gratuitamente.\n[#13](c13#c-13) No necesito que Felipe y Josep hagan este tipo de declaraciones para señalar su cara dura y su hipocresía. Ambos personajes tienen una amplia trayectoria de felonías contrastadas. Me limito a expresar que su supuesto apoyo a la población palestina en este contexto es completamente falsa y que el interés que tienen en hacer estas declaraciones es pura y simplemente lavar un poco su maltrecha imagen.\n[#16](c16#c-16) y si dices que sin tan malos pa que iban a querer ponerse en contra a países poderosos? Si tan malos son pasarían de la gente y preferirían congraciarse con los poderosos",
