    "text": "This kind of talk, larded as it is with dreary Marxist rhetoric about “colonization,” is why we are seeing the increasing physical intimidation and menacing of Jewish students on campuses, and sometimes even physical attacks. “American Muslims for Palestine Official Taher Herzallah at San Diego Mosque: This Is the Time to Make Zionists Feel Very Uncomfortable on Campuses; It Is Incumbent Upon the Muslims to Rule Palestine, Enforce the Rules of Allah on Earth,” [MEMRI](https://www.memri.org/tv/amp-official-taher-herzallah-san-diego-mosque-gaza-yemen-october-seven-zionists-uncomfortable-campus), December 23, 2023: AMP director of outreach and grassroots organization Taher Herzallah spoke at a December 23, 2023 AMP event held at the Islamic Center of San Diego about pro-Palestinian student activism. He said that this is the time to make the Zionists feel “very uncomfortable on campus.” He stated that the “Zionists are really going to regret the day they made Muslims their enemy,” and he claimed that the Jews colonized Palestine in order to be accepted into “whiteness.” Herzallah said that on October 7, the people of Yemen and Gaza destroyed the “veneer of superiority” of the West and the colonizers, and he advised his audience to follow the path they have set. He said that it is “incumbent” on the Muslims to rule Palestine from the River to the Sea and that the Muslims will “bring the rules that Allah gave us to this earth, because that’s what we were sent for.” Other speakers at the AMP event were the mosque’s imams, Taha Hassane and Shaykh Abdeljalil Mezgouri, Dr. Ahmed Soboh, the religious director of the Islamic Center of Yorba Linda, religious advisor of the Chino Calley Islamic Center, former chairman of the Islamic shura council of southern California, and board member of CAIR LA, and Osama Shabaik, member of the “Irving 11,” along with Taher Herzallah. The event was streamed live on the YouTube channel of the Islamic Center of San Diego.",

    "text": "The [National Weather Service](/2018/09/no-hurricanes-this-fall/) announced a prediction about tornados that will affect us. Historically, an average of 80 tornadoes roar through the nation during the month of March. Last year, however, the country was crushed by 208. The new weather service prediction for 2024 says there should be fewer than that this year. During March the tornados will largely occur in the deep South, from Florida to Texas. In April, they should appear in Tornado Alley — Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri and parts of Louisiana, Iowa, Nebraska and eastern Colorado. But then in May, the situation becomes dangerous in the Northeast — our neck of the woods, in Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The number expected is between 250 and 375 whereas the year before it was 172. Tornadoes in our area have been an occasional problem in prior years. Hurricanes have been the big worry. But in recent years, [hurricanes](/2020/07/hurricanes-may-or-may-not-miss-us-and-they-leave-deadly-rip-tides/) start out in the Caribbean but then veer into the Gulf of Mexico to tear things up in Louisiana, Texas and the west coast of Florida. The Gulf Stream has changed, it’s said. Hurricanes come with an advanced warning. You see them charging up the coast. But with tornados there’s just “Look out!” and get out of the way — if you can. It’s alarming. And very spooky. In 1989, the first tornado since record-keeping began in 1950 hit the Hamptons. I reported on it. It picked up steam is it roared silently across Long Island Sound late one night, coming into Three Mile Harbor where it tore the roof off one of the marina buildings across the street from my house, then ripped the top of my chimney off, blew away a tree house I’d built but never got to see ever again, then lifted up and came down a second time on Main Street in downtown Bridgehampton, tearing up trees to finally demolish a greenhouse at Thayer’s Hardware & Patio before petering out where Butter Lane meets Main Street just before it might have reached what was then the home office of Dan’s Papers. Since that time, many have come through the Hamptons, the most recent a [group of six](/2021/11/tornado-in-manorville-was-strongest-of-3-on-li/) that scurried through Quogue and Shinnecock in 2021.",

    "text": "五一假期将至，正是休憩游玩的时候，然而这几天对于 小S 来说，可能并不安稳，因为她已经搬出了 帝宝 豪宅，入住S妈的住所，虽然都是豪宅，还对外界表示是为了多陪陪妈妈，然而熟悉她的网友都看出来了，她这次回娘家并没有那么简单。\n首先回顾一下小S的人生轨迹，自2005年和 许雅钧 结婚之后，20年来一直居住在许家的帝宝豪宅，和公公婆婆一起居住。帝宝豪宅是台省数一数二的豪华住宅，这里的邻居都是有头有脸的人物，让小S非常自豪，曾多次在《康熙来了》中自夸公公有实力。\n20年没动窝，这次却突然搬离，不能不让人产生联想，因为不久前台媒曾爆料，小S婚姻告急，原因是许雅钧对妻子多年来一直沉迷饮酒，把不好的生活习惯带回家，还常年吃药对抗抑郁，对孩子产生了不好的影响。\n还有更重要的一点，据外界猜测，许家一直想要个男丁传宗接代，小S却连生三个女儿，公公去年离世前没能看到孙子，让许雅钧感到非常羞愧，在爸爸去世后决心改变现状，与小S离婚。\n从许家一向的行事风格来看，这种猜测很有可能成为现实。\n另外除了搬家之外，目前还有两个疑点都可以视为离婚前兆，一个是小S的大女儿Elly和二女儿Lily都不在家，Elly是去北美上学，Lily则本应在台北学习，还有不少工作，现在却跑去欧洲旅行，很可能是小S和许雅钧为了离婚先支开女儿。\n第二个是小S自春节之后一直没有工作，状态非常差，估计除了思念 大S ，也有婚姻亮红灯的因素。\n直到小S搬家，网友才发现，大S原来是S家唯一有房产的人。小S这次住进的S妈住所，其实是大S的房子，大S生前有两套豪宅，一套是自己花了2.1亿台币入手，多年来一直给S妈和大姐住，另一套是 汪小菲 花4.6亿台币入手，大S得到这套房子后，不到半年就与具俊晔再婚，现在由具俊晔单独居住。\n小S之前住在帝宝虽然很好，却是属于公公家的财产，离婚也分不到。如果她和许雅钧离婚的话，S妈、小S都得住在大S的房子里。\n当然，网友希望这一切不会发生，希望小S和许雅钧能够长长久久，白首偕老。",
