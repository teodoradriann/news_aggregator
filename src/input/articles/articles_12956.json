    "title": "New Fossils Reveal Diverse Terrestrial Ecosystem 75,000 Years after End-Permian Mass Extinction",
    "text": "Searching for land refugia becomes imperative for human survival during the hypothetical sixth mass extinction. Studying past comparable crises can offer insights, but there is no fossil evidence of diverse megafloral ecosystems surviving the most severe biotic crisis in the past 540 million years — the end-Permian mass extinction. In new research, paleontologists investigated plant and tetrapod fossils and various microfossils from the Permian-Triassic South Taodonggou section in Xinjiang, China. Their fossil records reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction.\nArtistic reconstruction of the terrestrial ecological landscape during, before, and after the end of the Permian mass extinction based on fossil palynomorphs, plants, and tetrapods recovered, as well as sedimentological data from the South Taodonggou section in Xinjiang, China. Image credit: D.H. Yang.\nThe end-Permian mass extinction , which occurred approximately 252 million years ago, is widely recognized as the most severe among the five major Phanerozoic extinctions.\nThis catastrophic event resulted in the extinction of approximately 80% of known species, a fact well-supported by marine fossil records.\nSome scientists suggest that volcanic eruptions in Siberia triggered widespread terrestrial devastation through wildfires, acid rain, and toxic gases.\nEvidence for this includes the successive extinction of characteristic Gigantopteris flora in South China and typical Glossopteris flora across Gondwanaland around the end-Permian mass extinction.\nHowever, other scientists argue that these catastrophic effects were limited by latitude and atmospheric circulation.\nSome fossil discoveries even suggest that certain Mesozoic plants existed before the extinction event, pointing to uninterrupted evolution.\nThe newly-discovered fossils from the South Taodonggou section, located in the Turpan-Hami Basin of Xinjiang province, northwestern China, offer a unique perspective.\n“The presence of intact tree trunks and fern stems further confirms that these microfossils represent local vegetation, not transported remnants,” said Professor Mingli Wan, a researcher with the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nAlthough some plant species disappeared locally, the researchers found that the overall extinction rate of spore and pollen species in the South Taodonggou section was possibly only about 21% — far lower than the marine extinction rate during the same period.\nThis conclusion was based on the discovery of many ‘missing’ species in Early Triassic layers elsewhere, indicating temporary migration rather than permanent extinction.\nThis stable vegetation base was crucial for the rapid recovery of the local ecosystem.\nFossil evidence shows that within just 75,000 years after the extinction ended, the area supported diverse tetrapods, including herbivorous Lystrosaurus and carnivorous chroniosuchians, demonstrating a quick return to a complex food web.\nThis discovery contrasts with the previous understanding that ecosystem recovery after the end-Permian extinction took over a million years.\nThe new evidence suggests local ecological diversity in this area recovered more than ten times faster than in other regions.\nThe scientists cited the region’s stable, semi-humid climate as crucial to its biological resilience. According to analysis of paleosol matrices, the region consistently received about 1,000 mm of rainfall per year during this time.\nDue to its consistent precipitation, South Taodonggou offered more abundant vegetation and a more habitable environment than other regions following the end-Permian mass extinction, providing vital support for migrating animals.\nDespite its proximity to the volcanic activity that triggered the end-Permian extinction, the Turpan-Hami Basin provided a safe haven for terrestrial life, demonstrating that even seemingly dangerous locations can harbor crucial biodiversity.\n“This suggests that local climate and geographic factors can create surprising pockets of resilience, offering hope for conservation efforts in the face of global environmental change,” said Professor Feng Liu, also from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n“In light of current concerns about a potential sixth mass extinction driven by human activity, the discovery of this ‘Life Oasis’ highlights the importance of identifying and protecting such natural refugia.”\nThe study was published in the journal Science Advances .",

    "text": "Italy- /\nMedical Equipment- /\n- BIT:ELN\nWith EPS Growth And More, EL.En (BIT:ELN) Makes An Interesting Case\nInvestors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like EL.En (BIT:ELN), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nEL.En's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, EL.En has grown EPS by 11% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for EL.En remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 6.1% to €577m. That's progress.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n See our latest analysis for EL.En\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for EL.En's future profits.\nAre EL.En Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\nInvestors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.\nWith strong conviction, EL.En insiders have stood united by refusing to sell shares over the last year. But the real excitement comes from the €145k that Non-Executive Director Alberto Pecci spent buying shares (at an average price of about €9.68). Purchases like this clue us in to the to the faith management has in the business' future.\nThese recent buys aren't the only encouraging sign for shareholders, as a look at the shareholder registry for EL.En will reveal that insiders own a significant piece of the pie. Actually, with 36% of the company to their names, insiders are profoundly invested in the business. Shareholders and speculators should be reassured by this kind of alignment, as it suggests the business will be run for the benefit of shareholders. At the current share price, that insider holding is worth a staggering €348m. That level of investment from insiders is nothing to sneeze at.\nShould You Add EL.En To Your Watchlist?\nAs previously touched on, EL.En is a growing business, which is encouraging. Better yet, insiders are significant shareholders, and have been buying more shares. That makes the company a prime candidate for your watchlist - and arguably a research priority. Now, you could try to make up your mind on EL.En by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.\nThe good news is that EL.En is not the only stock with insider buying. Here's a list of small cap, undervalued companies in IT with insider buying in the last three months!\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if EL.En might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nAccess Free Analysis\nHave feedback on this article?

    "title": "Bitcoin Dominance Falls Below Critical Level For The First Time This Cycle, Altcoin Season Coming?",
    "text": "Latest news about Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Your daily crypto news habit.\nThe Bitcoin dominance has now fallen below 60% for the first time in six months. But despite altcoins moving to grab more market share, this high dominance has remained a hindrance for the altcoin market. Given this, the Bitcoin dominance is expected to continue to determine where the crypto market will be headed from here, and by extension, when the altcoin season will begin.\nHow Bitcoin Dominance Is Driving The Market\nAs the crypto market struggles to find its footing in an ever-changing macro landscape, Bitcoin’s dominance continues to put pressure on the broader altcoin market. Crypto analyst Luca points this out in an analysis that focused on the Bitcoin dominance and how it is driving the market recently.\nLuca points out that the Bitcoin dominance had actually dropped below a notable level for the first time this cycle. This is the Weekly Bull Market Support Band, and the last time that the dominance was below this level was back during the last cycle. In addition to breaking below this support band, the Bitcoin dominance also happened to have retested this same level as resistance.\nHistorically, such a move is not bullish for the price, but the bearishness tends to play out over a longer period of time compared to the short-term. As Luca explains, this is because it signals that risk appetites are high once again, and market makers tend to use this as a distribution tool.\nAmid this, the crypto analyst expects that attention will begin to shift as investors rotate out of Bitcoin. Naturally, this rotation would lead to a move into altcoins, which currently have a higher margin for profits compared to Bitcoin, which is trading close to all-time highs.\nAltcoin Season And The Dominance Bottom\nOnce the rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins begins, then it could signal the start of the altcoin season. This would be characterized by a massive drop in the Bitcoin dominance as large-cap altcoins begin to rally and steal market share. Then, the wait for the Bitcoin dominance bottom begins.\nLuca points out that this phase will only end once the Bitcoin dominance finds a bottom. As for where the bottom might lie, the crypto analyst points to the 47%-48% level as the possible bottom. Once this happens, it would signal an end to the altcoin season as Bitcoin begins to take control again.\nDisclaimer\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not reflect the views of Bitcoin Insider.

    "text": "While the US is trying to put on a united front to prevent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, many US allies are reluctant to participate in the task force that’s been formed, formally known as Operation Prosperity Guardian,\nReuters reported on Thursday.\nThe Pentagon claims 20 countries are participating in the operation, but the US has only announced 12. “We’ll allow other countries, defer to them to talk about their participation,” Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters last week.\nEven some of the countries the US said were members of the coalition have issued statements distancing themselves from it. After the US announced the launch of Operation Prosperity Guardian and said Spain was a participant, Madrid\ndenied its involvement. The Spanish Defense Ministry said it “will not participate unilaterally in the Red Sea operation.”\nItaly, which was also included in the US announcement, said it would send a frigate to protect Italian shipping interests but made clear the deployment was not part of the US-led operation.\nNotably absent from the coalition is Saudi Arabia, one of the US’s main partners in the region. The US has backed Riyadh in a war against the Houthis since 2015, but Saudi Arabia is now seeking peace and fears its involvement could provoke Houthi attacks on its oil infrastructure. Bahrain is the only Arab country that the US said was part of the operation.\nThe Houthis started the attacks against Israel-linked shipping due to the Israeli onslaught in Gaza and said they won’t stop until the siege ends. Countries are likely reluctant to participate in the US-led coalition because they don’t want to appear to be supporting the Israeli massacre, which has killed over 21,000 Palestinians.\nOn Thursday, the US announced\nnew sanctions targeting a financial network allegedly tied to the Houthis over the attacks in the Red Sea. There’s no sign the Houthis will back down in the face of US sanctions or other actions.",

    "text": "Plan social à Auchan : en Vaucluse, FO craint une casse sociale Par Benjamin JANSSENS\nPublié le 29/11/24 à 17:46\nPour les futurs licenciés, les fêtes ne seront pas joyeuses.\nPHOTO REY Jerome\nCommenter Partager Ce vendredi 29 novembre, devant l'entrée du magasin Auchan Le Pontet, une poignée de militants FO s'est réunie \"afin d'informer et de sensibiliser les clients\" aux bouleversements à venir dans les hypers d'Avignon (Le Pontet et Mistral) et de Cavaillon. Sous l'enseigne \"Joyeuses fêtes\" de circonstance, David Romagnani, délégué FO (syndicat majoritaire au sein du collège des employés dans le bassin de vie) et ses camarades étaient inquiets et en colère.\n\" Trois semaines après l'annonce d'un vaste plan social qui prévoit le licenciement d'une cinquantaine de salariés ici, nous nous retrouvons ce jour non pour faire grève, mais pour exprimer notre désaccord sur plusieurs points , a expliqué le représentant. D'abord, le PSE ( plan de sauvegarde de l'emploi ) accepté par les syndicats majoritaires au niveau national, qui sont à la solde des dirigeants - la CFTC et Sega, le syndicat des entreprises du groupe Auchan - est un PSE au rabais. Ensuite, les salariés ciblés ne seront pas les seuls à perdre leur emploi.\"\nÀ lire aussi : Auchan : dans le Vaucluse, 150 emplois seraient menacés Et d'ajouter : \" Au Pontet, par exemple, il est prévu de délocaliser 70 personnes suite à la réduction de l'espace de vente d'un tiers en 2025 (6 000 m² sur 18 000 m², Ndlr). Il pourra leur être imposé de prendre des postes loin de chez eux, et s'ils refusent, ce sera : merci, au revoir. Ajoutez à ça 50 départs à la retraite, et le nombre de salariés devrait passer de 590 à 390. \"\nÀ lire aussi : Les hypermarchés Auchan vont se séparer de 50 collaborateurs vauclusiens Au côté de David Romagnani, Farid Imoussaten, élu FO à Cavaillon , a aussi pointé un paradoxe. \" Les 6 000 m² perdus seront vendus 5 millions d'euros à Ceetrus, la filiale immobilière du groupe Auchan, qui pourrait louer les lieux à Zara. Mais Auchan devra dépenser 11,4 millions d'euros pour rénover les 12 000 m² de magasin restants. On réduit la masse salariale d'un côté, et on dépense des millions d'euros de l'autre… \"\nDémarrez la conversation Votre opinion compte pour nous.
