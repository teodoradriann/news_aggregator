    "title": "Corporate Leadership in Climate Action: A Strategic Blueprint for Achieving Net Zero",
    "text": "Diego Espinoza’s Visionary Approach at New York Energy Week 2024: Integrating Environmental Goals with Corporate Strategy Diego Espinoza , Co-Founder and CEO of Voiz Academy , articulates a transformative view at New York Energy Week 2024 , emphasizing the pivotal role corporations play in leading the global shift toward sustainable energy . He challenges the conventional wisdom that individual consumer actions are the primary drivers of environmental impact, positing instead that corporate strategy and decision-making hold the keys to effective climate action.\nIntegrating Climate Goals with Corporate Strategy\nEspinoza explores the necessity of weaving climate initiatives into the broader corporate strategy. He advocates that to achieve meaningful progress toward net-zero emissions, businesses must view their climate strategies as integral to their overall business objectives, not merely as compliance obligations. This integration ensures that environmental strategies drive substantial change, aligning with corporate growth and profitability goals.\nStrategic Tools for Modeling the Future\nHighlighting the role of sophisticated tools in strategic planning, Espinoza introduces the En-ROADS simulation model developed by MIT and Climate Interactive. This tool enables companies to simulate various scenarios and outcomes based on different energy decisions, aiding in comprehensive strategic planning and forecasting for a low-carbon future.\nOvercoming Internal Challenges in Sustainability Implementation\nIn his discussion, Espinoza identifies key internal challenges that corporations face in implementing robust climate strategies. He outlines obstacles such as aligning profit goals with environmental initiatives, controlling energy sources, managing product lifecycle impacts, and dismantling organizational silos. He emphasizes the need for strategic insight and leadership to navigate and overcome these challenges effectively.\nThe Demographic Shift and Stakeholder Influence\nEspinoza discusses the profound impact of demographic shifts on corporate environmental strategies, particularly the influence of younger generations entering the workforce. He describes these new workers as “climate natives,” whose expectations are reshaping corporate priorities and necessitating a reevaluation of environmental responsibilities within corporate strategies.\nVisualizing the Path to Net Zero with the Waterfall Chart\nEspinoza introduces the “waterfall chart,” a strategic tool that clearly maps out the steps necessary to achieve net-zero emissions. This chart helps visualize the starting point, necessary interventions, and the incremental steps needed to reach the ultimate goal, facilitating clearer communication and strategic alignment within corporations.\nIn summary, Espinoza’s presentation at New York Energy Week underscores the critical role of corporate leadership in environmental sustainability. His strategic insights offer a blueprint for how companies can integrate environmental goals into their core business strategies, ensuring both ecological responsibility and long-term business success.\n>>> WATCH THE VIDEO OF THE PRESENTATION SESSION HERE",

    "title": "U.S. agency approves a giant natural gas export project — despite Biden’s pause",
    "text": "By Joel Kirkland and Carlos Anchondo ,\n1 hour ago Federal Energy Regulatory Commission headquarters in Washington. | Francis Chung/E&E News\nFederal regulators on Thursday approved one of the nation's largest natural gas export projects, despite a White House effort to temporarily halt the growth of overseas gas shipments amid worries about their climate impact.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the permit for the proposed Calcasieu Pass 2 liquefied natural gas terminal, a hotly debated project along the coast of Louisiana.\nThe green light for Virginia-based Venture Global comes months after the Department of Energy announced it would stop issuing new export licenses while it studies how U.S. shipments of natural gas affect American consumers and contribute to climate pollution. Under the FERC permit approved Thursday, the company can build the export facility but will have to wait for the Energy Department to issue a separate permit to ship the gas overseas.\nMethane, the major component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to rising global temperatures when it’s emitted into the atmosphere. It is also a major source of fuel for electricity generators and home heating in the United States, in parts of Europe and across Asia.\nThe FERC decision came hours before President Joe Biden is due to face former President Donald Trump in their first debate ahead of the November election. Trump has made Biden’s energy and climate policies a major target of his criticism , ridiculing Biden’s support for electric car subsidies and promising to put the brakes on the administration’s hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for clean energy projects.\nBut Biden can also boast — or steer well clear of — another fact: The United States is the largest oil and natural gas exporter in the world. That mostly happened on Biden’s watch, as oil prices rose again after the global Covid pandemic ended and drillers in West Texas set new production records. The White House has faced withering criticism from environmental groups upset that Biden hasn’t done more to cut off drilling on public lands and pushed a harder line against oil profits.\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, the Biden administration helped facilitate shipments to European nations as they attempted to replace Russian gas. That helped support the energy industry. But it also put a spotlight on Europe’s dependence on gas to fuel its economies .\nThe DOE pause is temporary, White House officials assured the industry and angry Republicans when it was first announced in January. Officials have said DOE expects to lift the pause by the end of March 2025. And in the meantime, it doesn’t prevent FERC from continuing to issue permits for gas export infrastructure, most of which is along the Gulf Coast.\nFight over fossil fuels The Louisiana terminal project, known as CP2, is designed to send more than 20 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas per year to global customers.\nIf ultimately built, it will be next to the existing Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana’s Cameron Parish. The new project has become a flashpoint in a national debate around fossil fuels and oil and gas export infrastructure.\n“This project will be critical to global energy security and supporting the energy transition, as well as provide jobs and economic growth across Louisiana and the United States,” Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel said in a statement Thursday.\nFERC is an independent agency under the Energy Department, with commissioners nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The commission voted 2-1 vote to issue the permit.\nDeparting Commissioner Allison Clements, a Democrat, dissented. \"The commission has not adequately addressed the project's environmental and socioeconomic impacts, including adverse impacts on environmental justice communities,\" Clements said at the start of the meeting.\nCritics of the project gathered outside FERC’s headquarters, near Washington’s Union Station.\nRoishetta Ozane, founder of the group Vessel Project of Louisiana, said it’s time to “write FERC off.” She said activists are going to put pressure on the Biden administration to rein in fossil fuels.\n“We’re going to say that FERC is a rogue agency that does not care about communities,” Ozane told a crowd of a few dozen people. “But who can do something while we are here is this administration. We need to continue to put pressure on the Department of Energy.”\nOzane also called for DOE’s pause on natural gas export approvals to be made permanent.\nIn a media briefing Thursday after FERC’s open meeting, Chair Willie Phillips, a Democrat, said considering gas projects for approval requires a delicate balance. He said FERC has a duty to environmentally disadvantaged communities and also a duty to abide by the law.\n“I’ve been consistent — when matters are complete, when our review is final, then we give those matters a vote,” Phillips said. “And this matter is consistent with the standard that we’ve set for every other project.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "[Celebrity News](../)\nTheresa Nist Celebrated Daughter Jen’s Birthday Amid ‘Golden Wedding’\nThe Golden Bachelor’s\n[Theresa Nist](//www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/golden-bachelor-finalist-theresa-nist-6-things-to-know/) had a lot to celebrate on Thursday, January 4. Not only did the reality star officially get married to Gerry Turner, she celebrated daughter Jen Woolston’s birthday as well.\n“Happy birthday to my beautiful, strong, kind, supportive, loving, super smart, and overall wonderful and amazing daughter, and my best friend, Jennifer Ann!!” Theresa shared via Instagram on Thursday, January 4. “I could not dream of a better daughter. I love you with all my heart!!! I hope you have the best birthday ever!!!!”\nJen’s birthday was briefly mentioned during\n[The Golden Wedding](//www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/gerry-turner-theresa-nists-guests-tease-golden-wedding-ceremony/) special when she spoke during her mom’s wedding ceremony.\n“Please welcome Theresa’s daughter, Jen. And happy birthday, Jen,” wedding officiant and former\n[Golden Bachelor](//www.usmagazine.com/shows/golden-bachelor/) contestant Susan Noles said during the televised ceremony. Theresa offered a big smile and clapped for her daughter when her birthday was mentioned.\n“I’ve said many times since I first heard the incredible news that my mom and Gerry were engaged that this feels surreal, like, how is this real life?” Jen wondered during her speech during Thursday’s live ceremony. “But somehow, it was always meant to be. Fate. Mom, you found your person to go to Italy with. And Gerry, you’ve got your person to share a sunset with. And you have the love and support of all your children and grandchildren.”\nJen was first introduced to Golden Bachelor viewers during Theresa’s hometown date, which aired in November 2023. She was always supportive of her mom’s decision to find love, after the\n[death of her father](//www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/golden-bachelor-winner-theresa-nists-quotes-about-late-husband-billy/), William “Billy” Nist, nearly a decade ago.\n“It doesn’t really feel that weird for some reason,” Jen, whose kids were part of the wedding, said on the Golden Bachelor. “It doesn’t change how much love we have for my dad.”\nWhen it came time for Theresa’s wedding ceremony to Gerry, Jen was front and center for the planning process.\n“My daughter has been helping me tremendously. She put together the vision board, and it was all beautiful. I love flowers, so important, and I love music,” Theresa\n[told Us Weekly exclusively](//www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerry-turner-and-theresa-nist-preview-their-wedding-dress-guest-list/) days before her wedding. “I think just really to make this the most warm, wonderful family-oriented wedding, and to try not to even think that there are cameras around. Try to make it an intimate moment that we’re sharing with a lot of people.”\nAhead of the big day, Jen posted throwback photos from her own wedding to husband Matt Woolston in 2011.\n“Sitting on the plane… went back to look at pics from my wedding day,” she captioned a Tuesday, January 2,\n[Instagram post](//www.instagram.com/p/C1n0m0Ct0Pd/?hl=en&img_index=1). “Can’t wait to support my best girl like she did for me. love you @theresa_nist you’re going to be an incredible bride and I can’t wait to see it with my own eyes. 💛💛💛”\nCheckout latest world news below links :\n[World News](/) || [Latest News](/news) || [U.S. News](/news/us-news)\n[Source link](//www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/theresa-nist-celebrated-daughter-jens-birthday-amid-golden-wedding/)",

    "text": "Valladolid\nPacientes y sanitarios sufren temperaturas de hasta 34º en el Centro de Especialidades de Pilarica'Pingüinos' portátiles en algunas consultas y los ventiladores instalados en salas de espera apenas alivian una situación que se repite de veranos anteriores\nHace calor estos días, mucho, en el Centro de Especialidades de Pilarica, que atiende a pacientes del área este de Valladolid, la que tiene como ... hospital de referencia el Clínico. El termómetro marcaba mediada la mañana de este miércoles 34º en una sala de la segunda planta del antiguo ambulatorio con dos ventiladores funcionando a toda marcha que apenas aliviaban una situación que afecta a los pacientes que acuden a consulta y a los profesionales que los atienden y que deben soportar esa escalada de temperatura durante su jornada laboral.\n«Aquí no se puede estar de calor», «es inhumano» o «esto no se puede aguantar» son expresiones que cruzaban pacientes que buscaban alivio en las sillas con ventilador cercano y sanitarios que se esforzaban porque esperaran lo menos posible en una mañana en la que ese alza del termómetro llegó a afectar a alguno de los equipos. Fuentes sindicales indican que un espirómetro que sirve para hacer pruebas de pulmón se desconectó y estuvo fuera de uso hasta que bajó la temperatura donde estaba instalado. Picos del termómetro que se alcanzan en las olas de calor, cada vez más habituales.\nDesde la gerencia del Clínico piden disculpas a usuarios y profesionales y agradecen a estos últimos su labor\nLa situación no es nueva. En el centro que se levanta a la vera del río Esgueva y presta apoyo en la asistencia de especialistas al Hospital Clínico, en la calle Doce de Octubre, no hay aire acondicionado y todos los años se repiten episodios de calor elevado en salas de espera y consultas. En estas últimas se distribuyen climatizadores portátiles, los populares 'pingüinos', pero estos aparatos no llegan a todas las consultas y estancias para pruebas médicas.\n«El año pasado ya sufrimos una situación similar y en este momento estamos pasando lo mismo o más. Es horroroso», apunta un trabajador sanitario que desarrolla su labor en el centro de Pilarica. Esa temperatura de 34 grados se producía en un espacio que alberga consultas de Otorrinolaringología, Oftalmología y Neumología, con la unidad para atender a personas adictas al tabaco y la escuela del asma. A estas últimas acuden pacientes, sobre todo en el caso de los que padecen problemas respiratorios, a lo que el calor excesivo afecta especialmente.\nPersianas bajadas y algún ventilador intentan mitigar, sin lograrlo, el calor acumulado en un edificio añoso, sin aire acondicionado y que tiene como elemento identificativo una escalera de caracol acristalada en su fachada principal para comunicar las distintas plantas y que contribuye a calentar el interior en los meses estivales. «En invierno se va el calor por la escalera y en verano se convierte en un invernadero que extiende la temperatura por otros espacios», señala otra trabajadora, que explica que se intenta ventilar el centro por las mañanas, cuando la temperatura es más fresca, pero que con noches tropicales como las que ha vivido Valladolid en estas jornadas esa práctica se inoperativa.\nLa ley establece un máximo de 27º en espacios de trabajo techados y superarlos puede acarrear sanciones a las empresas\nLos 34 grados que reflejaba el termómetro en una de las salas de espera del edificio sanitario de Pilarica están fuera de la normativa de salud laboral. La legislación estipula temperaturas máximas de 27 grados en el interior de inmuebles para actividades laborales equiparables a labores de despacho, marcador que no debe superar los 25º si la labor de los trabajadores implica alguna movilidad. Superar esos marcadores implica adentrarse en un ambiente de «estrés térmico» que puede repercutir en la salud de los trabajadores. Y en el caso de un centro sanitario, se añade que acuden personas enfermas. La normativa para afrontar jornadas de altas temperaturas se actualizó en 2022 para regular con mayor rigor la situación de profesionales que trabajan en la vía pública, al aire libre.\nValoración oficial\nDesde la Gerencia del Hospital Clínico Universitario piden disculpas a los pacientes y a los profesionales y trasladan a estos últimos un agradecimiento a su labor con esas condiciones de calor. Señalan que es un edificio que acarrea actualmente con las carencias propias de las construcciones de la época en la que levantó, entre ellas el déficit de climatización para afrontar una ola de calor, con «temperaturas excepcionales». Algo, remarcan desde el equipo directivo del que depende la gestión del centro de especialidades, que se intenta «paliar» con equipos portátiles para bajar la temperatura. Esta solución se ve limitada, explican, por el riesgo de sobrecarga de una instalación eléctrica dimensionada para «funcionalidades habituales, pero no para estas circunstancias excepcionales«.\n¿Tienes una suscripción?

    "text": "Presión, exceso de horas y falta de descanso: así es el día del trabajador de Taiwán\nLa isla es el sexto territorio con mayor carga laboral para sus ciudadanos de entre las 39 economías analizadas\nEl suicidio de un funcionario por un presunto caso de acoso laboral ha suscitado un profundo debate en Taiwán, cuyo progreso económico no se ha traducido en una mejora sustancial de los derechos de los trabajadores ni en cambios en una cultura que, según los expertos, resulta “opresiva”.\nChina amenaza a EE. UU. tras venta de armas a Taiwán: ¿Guerra inminente?\nLeer más\nLa muerte de este funcionario, un hombre de 39 años de apellido Wu, no sólo ha provocado la dimisión de la ministra de Trabajo y de otros altos cargos del Ministerio, sino que también ha generado acaloradas discusiones sobre la presión que sufren infinidad de profesionales, tanto del sector público como del privado.\nEn opinión de Roy Ngerng, investigador singapurense radicado en Taiwán, la cultura laboral de la isla todavía opera en un nivel “jerárquico y patriarcal”: los trabajadores “no suelen desafiar a sus superiores ni denunciarlos por mala conducta, y comportamientos como el acoso se acaban convirtiendo en una práctica común porque no se cuestionan”.\n“Algunas encuestas sostienen que los trabajadores de Taiwán son más infelices y están menos comprometidos con el trabajo, en comparación con otros países avanzados. Esto se debe a la falta de autonomía que experimentan”, afirma Ngerng a EFE.\nUNA PRESIÓN INSTITUCIONALIZADA\nLas circunstancias que rodearon el suicidio de Wu fueron objeto de discusión desde el primer momento: su cuerpo fue hallado el 4 de noviembre en una de las dependencias del Yuan Ejecutivo (Gobierno), y las redes sociales se llenaron rápidamente de especulaciones acerca de que su supervisora, Hsieh Yi-jung, lo sometía a constantes presiones y vejaciones.\nTaiwán emite alerta ante llegada del tifón Krathon, que sigue fortaleciéndose\nhttps://www.expreso.ec/actualidad/mundo/taiwan-emite-alerta-llegada-tifon-krathon-sigue-fortaleciendose-215403.html\nTras una investigación interna, la ahora exministra de Trabajo Ho Pei-shan aseguró que Hsieh no fue la responsable directa de esta muerte, que atribuyó a una combinación de “carga de trabajo excesiva”, “demasiado estrés” y “falta de recursos de apoyo”. Ho dimitió dos días después de proferir estas declaraciones, criticada por su tibieza a la hora de gestionar la situación.\nQuizá el caso de Wu sea aislado, pero su fallecimiento revela muchos de los problemas que arrastra la isla desde hace décadas. Si bien su desarrollo económico la ha puesto a la par de Japón y Corea del Sur en términos de PIB per cápita, Taiwán no se ha sacudido los vicios de un sistema laboral organizado en torno al sector manufacturero, en el que la presión, las jornadas maratonianas y la falta de descanso son la norma.\nSegún un informe publicado por el Ministerio de Trabajo a finales del año pasado, los taiwaneses trabajaron una media de 2.008 horas en 2022, por delante de Corea del Sur (1.904) y Japón (1.626), lo que convirtió a la isla en el sexto territorio con mayor carga laboral para sus ciudadanos de entre las 39 economías analizadas por el documento.\nPor si esto fuera poco, la Ley de Normas Laborales contempla unos descansos ínfimos para los trabajadores: un empleado que lleve entre seis meses y un año en una compañía taiwanesa tiene derecho a sólo tres días de vacaciones, y sólo a partir del quinto año trabajado de forma consecutiva en esa misma empresa puede disfrutar de hasta quince días de vacaciones pagadas.\n“El Gobierno y las empresas de Taiwán perciben a los trabajadores y sus derechos desde una lógica propia de la cadena de suministro manufacturera, que busca maximizar sus horas de trabajo, evitar que tomen descansos e incluso pagarles con costos mínimos (...). Taiwán aún no comprende que esta mentalidad anticuada genera numerosos inconvenientes”, denuncia Roy Ngerng.\nUN CAMBIO DE PARADIGMA NECESARIO\nMás de 600.000 afectados en China por el tifón Gaemi\nhttps://www.expreso.ec/actualidad/mundo/600-000-afectados-china-tifon-gaemi-208074.html\nEl fallecimiento de Wu ha desencadenado una cascada de críticas contra el Gobierno, hasta el punto de que el presidente, William Lai, tuvo que salir a pedir disculpas por lo sucedido. “Debemos trabajar para cambiar muchas de las culturas laborales que anteriormente se consideraban normales, y erradicar todas las formas de acoso en el lugar de trabajo“, escribió el mandatario en su cuenta de Facebook.\nPara Ngerng, el Ejecutivo debería impulsar leyes que impongan sanciones más severas para quienes obliguen a sus empleados a trabajar más allá de lo acordado, flexibilizar los criterios de sindicalización y subir el salario mínimo, fijado en 28.590 dólares taiwaneses (unos 881 dólares) para el próximo año.\n“Taiwán se encuentra atrapado en un dilema, mientras el partido gobernante no respalde sus palabras con acciones y comience a alinear los derechos laborales con su defensa de los derechos humanos“, sentencia el investigador.
