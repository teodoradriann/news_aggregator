    "title": "Weather warning as thunderstorms to follow ‘hottest day of the year’ this weekend",
    "text": "Thunderstorms and heavy rain are set to hit large swathes of the UK on Sunday just one day after Saturday could possibly be the hottest day of the year so far. Saturday is predicted to see temperatures rise as high as 26C in parts of south-east England, including around London, in what would be the hottest day of the year. However the hot weather could be short lived as a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms is set to come into place on Sunday. Impacting large swathes of Wales and western England from north to south, the warning will come into place from midday on Sunday and remain until 10pm. (Met Office) The warning comes with a possibility of flooding, travel delays and power cuts. Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north whilst growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area,” the Met Office said. “Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over 2 to 3 hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.” The turbulent weather may come as a surprise for many Britons who are currently enjoying this week’s sunshine. People across the nation from London to Manchester were seen enjoying the warm weather by relaxing in green spaces while it lasts. People make use of deckchairs at St James’s Park in central London (Jeff Moore/PA) (PA Wire) Temperatures have been consistently above 20C this week, with 25C weather expected in the south on Thursday and temperatures peaking ay 26C on Saturday. However, the Met Office cautioned that with warm weather comes an increase in UV levels, which are set to reach “moderate to high across the UK” in the coming days, particularly in the south. But alas, the poor conditions are set to return to a more “unsettled pattern” next week. From Sunday, thunderstorms are likely and the rain is forecast to return. It is still due to be quite warm – around 20 degrees celsius – but this then lowers throughout the week. By Thursday next week, the temperature is expected to have dropped to 17 degrees celsius. “Rain and showers will start to move in from the west, due to a developing low from the Atlantic,” the Met Office added. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Tony Wisson said:“Many places will start fine and warm on Sunday, though it is likely to become cloudier from the west or southwest during the day. This will be accompanied by scattered showers, which could be heavy with thunder. “On Monday we’re likely to see more widespread and longer-lived spells of rain, some of which will be heavy and thundery. This will also lead to a much cooler feel to the day.” Here is the UK’s 5 day forecast in full: Today: Morning mist and fog patches will soon clear to leave a fine warm day, with plenty of sunshine across the country. Perhaps cloudier at times across the far northeast of Scotland, with any early rain quickly clearing from here. Tonight: Plenty of evening sunshine, then dry overnight with prolonged clear spells. With light winds, there will be some mist and fog patches forming in places. Saturday: A warm sunny day for many, though some patchy coastal mist is possible in places. A few heavy afternoon showers or thunderstorms developing across northern England and southern Scotland. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: A warm and humid day on Sunday, with an increasing risk of thunderstorms. Turning cooler through Monday and Tuesday, with showers and longer spells of rain.

Global Compact Network Kenya has named MP Shah Hospital strategy and innovation manager Yvonne Kirigo and Ololo Farm, project manager Kevin Getobai as the 2024 Country SDG Pioneers. The two were selected from over 27 nominations for their contributions to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yvonne Kirigo has been recognized for her leadership in green initiatives at MP Shah Hospital, including e-waste collection, energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and water efficiency projects. These efforts have significantly reduced the hospital's environmental footprint. Kevin Getobai on the other hand was acknowledged for his work at Ololo Farm, where he integrated regenerative and sustainable agriculture practices. His introduction of Black Soldier Flies for composting has reduced the composting process from six months to 14 days, saving CO2 emissions and producing protein from waste. As a sustainability champion, Ololo Farm is now able to save up to 47.5 tonnes of CO2 equivalence, divert 25 tonnes of food waste from going into landfills, and produce 2.5 tonnes of protein from waste annually. “Their commitment to the Ten Principle of the UN Global Compact exemplifies the spirit of innovation and resilience needed to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Their work will inspire other participants in building a sustainable future for all,” said Global Compact Network Kenya executive director Judy Njino. As national winners, Kirigo and Getobai will compete in the Global round for the title of 2024 UN Global Compact SDG Pioneer. The global winners will be announced in September during the UN Global Compact Leaders' Summit in New York. The SDG Pioneers programme recognizes the dedicated professionals that drive and innovate solutions through new technologies, initiatives and business models that can enable the globe to reach the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. “We hope their work will inspire others to advance the Global Goals by implementing our Ten Principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption,” said Sanda Ojiambo, CEO & Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.",

    "title": "The BOM predicted a hot dry summer right before the flooding rains came…",
    "text": "By Jo Nova\nAustralians are angry the BOM didn’t see the flooding rains coming\nWorse, we’re betting the nation on the BOM’s ability to predict the climate.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) tells Australians that record breaking extremes are getting worse because of our cars and our air-conditioners (that’s “\nThe State of the Climate“). But when the BOM can’t predict record breaking rain a month in advance, or even the day before, we know the BOM doesn’t understand what drives the climate.\nSomehow the BOM expect Australians to spend trillions and rearrange their economy based on their fifty year prophesies, but not to mind when “this summer” goes right off the rails.\nBack in September the BOM issued its El Nino alert, and Australians were told it would be a\n hot and dry and to prepare for a summer of bushfires. Farmer sold their lambs, and adjusted harvest accordingly.\nThis was the BOM solemn prediction in late October, for the very next month of rainfall\nAcross most of Australia the\nodds were only 20-40% of getting average rain.\nInstead this is what happened:\nAnd in December most of the country was predicted to have a fifty fifty chance of getting “average” rain.\nBut the real weather gods had another idea, and all the places under any shades of green below got somewhere from 100% to 300% of the average rainfall. The indigo and purple zones got even more.\nThis was a savage downpour — seven feet of rain in five days fell at one location:\nNo fewer than 12 locations across far north Queensland posted record rainfall totals.\nSome areas received a year’s rainfall in a single day, isolating towns, closing highways and leaving hundreds stranded by surging floodwaters. Black Mountain near Cooktown recorded a cumulative 2189mm over the five days, while Mossman South, an hour northwest of Cairns, had 1935mm.\nAs the Mayor of Douglas Shire said:\n“If this is so record-breaking, how did no one know this was going to happen … we need to have forecasts closer to what is going on.”\nThe BOM suddenly wants to absolve itself of liability\nPeople have noticed there is now a mandatory check box forcing users to agree to a legal disclaimer clearing the BOM of all liability:\nUsers of the BOM app now have to agree to a 699-word “terms and conditions” statement that includes “information at this app … may not be accurate, current or complete”.\n“To the maximum extent permitted by law, the bureau excludes any liability that may arise in connection with the BOM Weather app or any information or material presented therein or your access to or use of any of the same,’’ the bureau says in a “terms and conditions” statement that appears when a user attempts to download its app. —\nMackenzie Scott, The Australian\nThey know they are in trouble.\nI say the BOM can have immunity the same day Australians can also tick a box excluding ourselves from any and all costs, imposts and taxes related to any BOM predictions.\nThe Australian editors gives the BOM an escape valve it doesn’t deserve:\nTo be fair to the BOM, a hysterical and ill-informed media has allowed climate alarmism to infect reporting of what should be routine weather events.\nFor thirty years the Australian media has made hyperbolic scare stories about the weather while the BOM tacitly stood by and smiled. Where were they as the tenets of science were trashed, and critics were called “climate deniers”? If the BOM are victims of this hyperbole now, they reap what they sowed.\nThe BOM raised the stakes, and they don’t get to weasel out by saying\n“we used the best science” as if the best science wasn’t riddled with holes. If the science is good enough to throw away trillions of dollars, then the worst failures need a truckload of explanation.\nPredicting the weather is hard. We could forgive the BOM for getting a complex immature science wrong, but not when they also tell us it’s just simple physics, they’re absolutely sure, and there is no doubt they’re wrong (give us your money!).",

    "text": "( MENAFN - The Peninsula) Bloomberg\nColombia's government will increase the nation's minimum wage by 12% next year, eliminating a key source of uncertainty for central bankers who have been divided over interest rate cuts.\nThe government decided that base salaries will rise to 1,300,000 pesos ($335.45) Labor Minister Gloria Ines Ramirez said Friday in remarks broadcast on social media platform X.\nThe hike comes days after Colombian central bankers relaxed monetary policy for the first time since 2020, lowering rates to 13% in a split decision.\nMinority members voted to keep borrowing costs unchanged, citing uncertainty and potential inflation risks from minimum wage talks. In the meeting minutes, they also emphasized the high degree of price indexation in the economy.\nAnnual inflation slowed to 10.15% in November, a figure that's still the highest among regional peers and more than twice the upper bound of the 2% to 4% target range.\nColombia has joined Latin American nations including Brazil, Chile and Peru in lowering borrowing costs as inflation eases and economic growth cools.\nMENAFN30122023000063011010ID1107671128\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Now in its third year, the Catalyst Incubator is described as a unique, cluster-based program that focuses on supporting start-ups in manufacturing, agriculture, technology, energy innovation and related sectors.\nOfficials say the Catalyst Incubator is 100 per cent funded by Carin through Alberta Innovates and is free for all selected entrepreneurs to participate.\nDuring the 8-week group, executives note that each learner/entrepreneur receives more than 50 hours of training from highly qualified mentors. At the final event, each of the five participants gave a 5-minute “pitch” where they provided background about their experience, explained their product, and (most importantly) why investors should support it. . Stakeholders viewed the pitches, asked questions, and provided feedback after the presentations.\nPast Catalyst participant Ben Schultz reflected, “The incubator gave me a window into a whole set of skills and processes for validation of an idea that I've never had to develop before.”\nKathy Forner of C4ner Consulting – Project Manager of the Catalyst Incubator commented, “The Catalyst Incubator is really for early-stage entrepreneurs who want to know what problem they're solving, and who their potential customers are.”\nOfficials say four groups of alumni have already gone through the program so far. A unique feature of the program is that mentors are specifically selected based on the needs of the learners in the group. This is said to allow the program to adapt its expert knowledge to the issues facing the group. Many learners are expected to take their business to market and turn it into a full-time business.\nOfficials say the Catalyst Incubator is currently looking for the next generation of future entrepreneurs interested in the customer discovery journey. The last date to apply is January 11, 2024.\nVisit ca-rin.ca/catalyst-incupator for more information on Catalyst and other training resources for entrepreneurs.\n,\ndownload rdnewsNOW Mobile app on Google Play and Apple App Store for all the latest updates on this and other stories.\nSource: rdnewsnow.com\nSource: biz.crast.net",

    "text": "Pasadas las 6:30 p. m. de este viernes, 29 de diciembre de 2023, el presidente Gustavo Petro y la ministra de Trabajo, Gloria Inés Ramírez, anunciaron que el salario mínimo 2024 en Colombia aumentará un 12% aproximadamente. Así la situación, el salario mínimo 2024 en Colombia quedó en $1.462.000, sumando el auxilio de transporte, que será de $162.000. Durante su discurso, el presidente Gustavo Petro habló sobre la cifra del desempleo en el país, que se ubica en 9% durante noviembre pasado. “Tenemos hoy una de las tasas de desempleo más bajas en los últimos años, solo por allá en 2017 se tuvo un 8,7%, hoy estamos en 9%. Ha crecido el empleo, más de 800.000 puestos de trabajo en un año que tuvo un incremento del salario mínimo de 16 puntos, mientras la inflación está a punto de llegar a un dígito. ¿Qué significa eso? Que muchas de las teorías económicas de expertos no fueron ciertas. El salario real en Colombia subió aproximadamente 6 puntos”, aseguró el mandatario. Presidente Gustavo Petro sobre el incremento del salario mínimo para 2024: \"Aquí dos millones y medio de familias vulnerables obtienen un beneficio neto con este decreto del Gobierno\".— Noticias Caracol (@NoticiasCaracol) Más en [https://t.co/yqNEZK7rZ3] [pic.twitter.com/iDHi52BGnE] [December 29, 2023] Asimismo, Petro se refirió a la inflación en el país, que está pronosticada que para el cierre de 2023 se ubique en un solo dígito: “En el año entrante, creemos que la inflación va a bajar más, ojalá se ubique en 6 o 5 puntos\". Publicidad El jefe de Estado también aseguró que \"dos y medio millones de familias vulnerables obtienen un beneficio neto con este decreto del Gobierno” que define el salario mínimo 2024 en Colombia. En ese orden de ideas, el presidente Gustavo Petro volvió a pedir que se bajen las tasas de interés en el país. “Quiero hacer propuestas: indudablemente la tasa de interés, que sigue hoy en 13%, bajó 0,5, estamos subiendo el salario mínimo a una tasa menor que la tasa de interés. Esa es una invitación a la junta directiva del Banco de la República a bajar más la tasa de interés. El dólar se está reevaluando, está a punto de bajar de los $3.800 y tiene que ver con que hay un mayor flujo de dólares a la economía nacional, que la demanda. Eso tiene que ver con un diferencial de tasas de interés reales entre nuestra economía y las economías desarrolladas”, aseguró el jefe de Estado. En ese orden de ideas, el presidente Gustavo Petro invitó al empresariado a “discutir la reforma tributaria. Es el momento de ver sus impactos y verla de cara a la producción. La reforma ha sido radicalmente transformada por decisiones judiciales, no es la misma que presentamos”. Publicidad Vea también:",
