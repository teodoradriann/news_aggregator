    "text": "Interim results from Phase 1a dose escalation to be presented Data provide clinical proof of concept for Adcentrx's novel technology platform; highlight unique opportunity for ADRX-0706 to address significant unmet needs for patients with limited therapeutic options SAN DIEGO , April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Adcentrx Therapeutics (\"Adcentrx\"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company redefining Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) therapies for cancer treatment and other life-threatening diseases, will present the first clinical data for ADRX-0706 at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting ( May 30 - June 3, 2025 ) in Chicago, IL.\nContinue Reading\nAdcentrx will deliver a poster presentation on ADRX-0706, a clinical-stage Nectin-4 ADC. The presentation will include interim clinical data from the Phase 1a portion of the ongoing trial ( NCT06036121 ), demonstrating the best-in-class potential for ADRX-0706. The findings indicate a differentiated safety and pharmacokinetic profile, including a significantly lower incidence of critically meaningful adverse events such as peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, preliminary efficacy signals across different dose levels and tumor types provide strong clinical validation of Adcentrx's ADC platform, including the i-Conjugation® technology and novel auristatin payload AP052.\nFirst clinical data from ADRX-0706 Phase 1a supports its differentiated safety, PK, and efficacy profile\nPost this The first-in-human Phase 1a/b study is an open-label, two-part trial being conducted at sites in the U.S. and China . The completed Phase 1a portion consisted of a dose escalation of ADRX-0706 to evaluate initial safety and tolerability in patients with select advanced solid tumors, and to identify the recommended dose to be used in Phase 1b . This ongoing second portion of the study aims to further evaluate ADRX-0706's safety and tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and optimal dose in urothelial, triple-negative breast and cervical cancers.\nDetails of the poster presentation at the ASCO Meeting are as follows:\nTitle: Preliminary results from a first-in-human phase 1 dose escalation trial of ADRX-0706, a next generation Nectin-4 ADC, in subjects with advanced solid tumors Abstract Number: 3018 Session Date & Time: Monday, June 2, 1:30 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. CST Session Title: Developmental Therapeutics—Molecularly Targeted Agents and Tumor Biology\nThe full abstract will be published by ASCO in conjunction with the Meeting.\nAbout i-Conjugation® Technology Adcentrx's proprietary i-Conjugation® technology platform is a core component in the design of the company's ADCs. The platform utilizes protease-cleavable linkers and stable conjugation chemistry to enhance payload delivery. This advanced technology ensures a highly stable ADC with the desired linker-payload.\nAbout ADRX-0706 ADRX-0706 is a fully proprietary ADC product candidate discovered by Adcentrx. The antibody component is a novel fully human IgG1 targeting Nectin-4, a cell surface adhesion protein with high expression in multiple solid tumors and limited expression in normal tissues. Nectin-4 is associated with poor disease prognosis and is a validated target for ADCs.\nThe ADRX-0706 antibody is linked to a proprietary tubulin inhibitor payload, AP052, through Adcentrx's innovative i-Conjugation® technology using a cleavable linker and stable conjugation chemistry. This novel platform technology enables a highly stable ADC with a drug-antibody ratio of eight (DAR 8) with a substantially expanded therapeutic window as demonstrated in preclinical studies.\nADRX-0706 has a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in preclinical models and has demonstrated significant efficacy across a variety of tumor indications in vitro and in vivo. ADRX-0706 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1a/b clinical trial.\nFor more information about the ADRX-0706 Phase 1a/b clinical trial, please refer to the Study ID NCT06036121 on ClinicalTrials.gov.\nAbout Adcentrx Therapeutics Adcentrx is a biotechnology company focused on accelerating breakthroughs in protein conjugate therapeutic development for cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Adcentrx has pioneered the development of an ADC technology platform addressing key components of protein conjugate design to solve challenges typically seen in ADCs. Adcentrx is developing a robust pipeline including two clinical-stage ADCs and multiple preclinical ADCs, all with first-in-class and best-in-class potential.\nFor more information about Adcentrx and its innovative ADC technologies, please visit https://adcentrx.com .\nContact Information: Investor Relations [email protected]\nSOURCE Adcentrx Therapeutics\nWANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM? 440k+\nNewsrooms &\nInfluencers 9k+\nDigital Media\nOutlets 270k+\nJournalists\nOpted In GET STARTED",

    "text": "In their 52-0 Week One win over Colorado State, the Texas Longhorns impressed across many across the country. That includes four-star safety Isaiah Williams who has not committed to a school yet. The Fort Bend Marshall product was originally schedule to visit Texas A&M but decided to visit Austin with teammate Caleb Chester and liked what he saw.\n“It was good. It was domination, what I expected,” Williams told Orangebloods Writer/ Editor Jason Suchomel . “It was a good game, good atmosphere. I had a good time all around.”\nWhile Williams has yet to finalize his list of schools, Texas has a strong chance to make his final list. Other programs that have made an offer include Baylor, Arizona State, Florida, and Ohio State. Rivals ranks him as the 23rd-best safety in the 2026 class.\nDuring the recruiting process, Texas has been hard at work building a relationship with Williams, which was on display during his surprise stop in Austin.\n“I talked to coach (Blake) Gideon, Sark, coach Terry Joseph after the game and before the game,” Williams told Suchomel. “They were just telling me that they want me, once again, I’m a top priority. They’re just waiting on me now. We’re still trying to build that relationship to the next level. It’s all coming together now.”\nThe Longhorns’ focus now is on ensuring that Williams decides to spend his college career in Austin.\nFollow all of your favorite Texas teams at Longhorns Wire , Cowboys Wire , Texans Wire , Rockets Wire , Aggies Wire and the Austin American-Statesman !",

    "title": "What will Steelers QB room look like in 2024?",
    "text": "The [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/) know one thing about their quarterbacks going into the offseason: change is needed. Whether the change is small, like finding a new rookie on Day 3 in the draft, or large, like trading for Russell Wilson, things will inevitably look different in 2024. [Spotrac’s Michael Ginnitti](https://www.spotrac.com/news/predicting-quarterback-resolutions-for-2024-2104/) suggested a solution for all quarterback rooms for the 2024 season, including the Steelers. Kenny Pickett carries a fully guaranteed 2 years, $4.6M, and should regain his starting gig next Spring. 2024 will be a pivotal year for the future of Pickett in Pitt. Mitchell Trubisky holds a non-guaranteed 2 years, $11.25M (incredibly). THE STEELERS RELEASE TRUBISKY BEFORE HIS $1M ROSTER BONUS IS DUE NEXT MARCH, RE-SIGNING MASON RUDOLPH TO A 1 YEAR, $2.5M CONTRACT TO BACKUP PICKETT. If Pickett and Rudolph were to return, it will likely give the Steelers reason to select a quarterback late in the draft this spring or sign an undrafted player. As we’ve learned this season, there is no such thing as too much quarterback depth, and the Steelers need to find some new blood to shake things up for next season.",

    "text": "The two-year-old son of famed Canadian producer David Foster and singer Katharine McPhee is lighting up the internet with his musical talents. In a video posted to TikTok by McPhee and Instagram by Foster, the pair’s son is seen playing an impressive drum solo alongside a recording of Michael Jackson’s song “Rock with You.” Foster is seen in the video seated watching his son, bopping his head along to the beat while the two-year-old rocks out on a mini drum set complete with his name, Rennie Foster, splashed across the bass drum. McPhee’s video included the caption “my 2 year old baby is a genius.” Foster, the 74-year-old musician and composer, is a 16-time Grammy winner who was born in Victoria. He married McPhee, a 39-year-old singer and actress who was the runner-up in the 2006 season of American Idol, in 2019. Celebrities like Kristin Chenoweth, Questlove, Nicole Sherzinger, Joey McIntyre, Sharon Stone, Debra Messing, Charlie Puth and others took to the video comments to hype up the young drummer.

Mas a verdade é que já houve um precedente\", referiu.\nO porta-voz do movimento Pais em Luta, Jorge Castro, sublinhou que a decisão do diretor é \"discriminatória\", já que, numa escola do concelho vizinho de Esposende, alunos nas mesmas circunstâncias conseguiram que lhes fosse garantida a renovação de matrícula no 12.º ano, já pela quarta vez consecutiva.\n\"Os nossos filhos não são 'precedentes', são seres humanos com necessidades especiais, e os recursos aparecem quando a necessidade assim o exige\", apontou.\nEm 12 de junho, os pais de crianças e jovens manifestaram-se frente à Segurança Social de Braga contra a falta de vagas em CACI na região.\nJorge Castro entrou mesmo em greve de fome, um protesto que acabaria por terminar já à noite, depois de o Instituto da Segurança Social ter deixado a garantia de criação de 60 vagas em Esposende, num \"curto espaço de tempo, entre seis meses a um ano\".\n\"Por um ano, se houvesse o mínimo de sensibilidade, o Agrupamento de Escolas Vale do Tamel não podia acolher mais dois alunos?\", criticou, sublinhando ser \"lamentável\" que o Estado \"atire para o desemprego pais trabalhadores, para cuidar dos seus filhos com necessidades especiais\".\nOs pais presentes na manifestação empunhavam cartazes com frases como \"Dignidade para os nossos filhos\", \"Somos pais, queremos trabalhar\", \"A deficiência não se esconde\" e \"Respeito pelo cidadão portador de deficiência\".\nO diretor do agrupamento, Alípio Barbosa, manifestou-se indisponível para falar aos jornalistas.",

    "text": "43m ago\nFirst off - I wish it was easier to get technical help & that EA had a 24/7 tech team that would use Team Viewer to help us. Then they could literally just go into our computer, find out what's wrong, take all the steps they need to in order to understand and solve the problem, and voila!\nBecause I need serious professional help. I am not tech savvy and I just want someone to do it for me. As soon as I enter Build Mode, the entire interface disappears. If I try to go back into play mode, the interface does not return, plus everything freezes. I can't even save or exit the game and just have to restart my computer.\nI have tried taking all my mods out of the EA folder. I have tried deleting all cache. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game entirely. I have tried deselecting the most recent expansion packs I've added prior to when these issues began. And so far nothing has worked and I can't think of what else to do.\nReally hoping I can get this fixed by December so my cousin can play when she visits >_<",

    "title": "Armes blanches à l'école : Trousse, cahier et cran d'arrêt",
    "text": "Le 17 juin, un enfant de 7 ans a été trouvé en possession d’un couteau à steak dans une école de Mulhouse. Intercepté, conduit au commissariat, il a reconnu qu’il voulait se « venger » d’un petit camarade de sa classe – en CE1, donc. Deux jours plus tard, un collégien de Blaye, en Gironde, était interpellé pour avoir exhibé un couteau dans la cour de son établissement, sans toutefois sembler vouloir s’en servir. Il a été lui aussi présenté aux gendarmes et placé en garde à vue.\nQuelques jours après le meurtre d’une surveillante, Mélanie, frappée à l’entrée de son établissement de Nogent par Quentin, un adolescent de troisième, quelques semaines après l’assassinat sauvage de Lorène, tuée de 57 (!) coups de couteaux dans sa salle de classe par Justin, 16 ans, ces évènements mettent en lumière une réalité encore peu connue du grand public : la présence grandissante des armes blanches dans l’enceinte des établissements scolaire, du lycée jusqu’à l’école primaire.\n« C’est un phénomène que l’on soupçonne davantage qu’on ne le constate directement, témoigne Ève Vaguerlant, professeur de français et essayiste . Si ces couteaux sont présents, ils restent le plus souvent dans les sacs – contrairement aux téléphones ! Mais nous connaissons tous des anecdotes édifiantes rapportées par des collègues, comme celle d’un élève en visite de classe à l’Assemblée nationale et dont le passage aux portiques de sécurité a révélé qu’il portait sur lui une lame de trente centimètres… » Les anecdotes viennent aussi souvent des élèves eux-mêmes, qui assurent que beaucoup de garçons (ou de filles) viennent aujourd’hui en classe avec des couteaux dans leur sac – alors qu’il y a trente ans, la seule exhibition d’un cutter en dehors du cours de technologie semblait une transgression incroyable valant exclusion du fautif.\nUn « port d’arme d’atmosphère », mélange de forfanterie, de mimétisme et de crainte.\nUn court reportage de TF1 précisait les contours de cette situation aberrante. « Pour 15€ on peut s’acheter un petit couteau « , témoignait ainsi, visage couvert, un collégien de Vitrolles (13). La transaction se réalisant souvent, sans surprise, dans les toilettes. Pourquoi un couteau ? « Pour faire les malins » , « pour impressionner » , parce que « c’est stylé » . Pour se protéger, aussi, éviter de se faire « racketter ». « C’est mon père qui me l’a donné » , avouait franchement une collégienne de Bain-de-Bretagne (35). Comme si un couteau pouvait servir à se défendre, à l’instar d’une bombe de gaz lacrymogène, alors qu’il peut surtout blesser ou tuer, et ce très rapidement. Un « port d’arme d’atmosphère « , comme l’appelle le pédopsychiatre Maurice Berger, spécialiste de la violence juvénile, mélange de forfanterie, de mimétisme et de crainte, qu’il est difficile d’évaluer quantitativement. « Si un personnel de la vie scolaire tombe sur un couteau, il ne va pas s’empresser de le crier sur les toits ou de nous le faire savoir, précise Ève Vaguerlant. Le réflexe est toujours de minimiser, de ne pas faire de vagues . »\nD’où vient ce phénomène ? « Pratiquement tous les jeunes que j’ai eu l’occasion de suivre en centre éducatif renforcé se munissaient d’un couteau au moment de sortir de chez eux, se souvient Maurice Berger . Ils vivaient dans une logique de territoire, celui du clan ou de l’ethnie, avec une problématique de rixe omniprésente. » Un univers violent qui prolonge parfois une histoire personnelle douloureuse (foyer fragilisé, père brutal – ou absent), ou que vient nourrir une culture propre à certaines populations. « C’est un sujet difficile car la doxa juridique actuelle assimile toute réflexion sur les mentalités à du racisme déguisé mais il est évident que le couteau, et je pense en particulier à la pratique de l’égorgement, est typique de la culture maghrébine ou islamique « , note un bon connaisseur des questions de sécurité.\nCette culture est désormais entrée à l’école, comme l’ont fait tous les autres maux de la société avant elle.\nC’était il y a une quinzaine d’années et le phénomène n’a jamais cessé, bien au contraire. « Aucun d’entre eux n’a renoncé à porter une arme sur lui « , reconnait Maurice Berger. La nouveauté est que cette culture est désormais entrée à l’école, comme l’ont fait tous les autres maux de la société avant elle. Et les couteaux, déjà présents dans les sacs, désormais se montrent, s’exhibent – et servent, parfois. Difficile de croire par exemple que les cas tragiques de Samuel Paty ou Dominique Bernard n’imprègnent pas, d’une manière ou d’une autre, l’imaginaire d’un jeune aujourd’hui décidé à passer à l’acte.\nReste l’éternelle question : que faire ? Que faire pour endiguer une « mode » qui, partout en France, angoisse les professeurs, les élèves, les parents, c’est-à-dire potentiellement tout le monde ? « La dissuasion doit reposer sur l’automaticité de la peine, affirme Maurice Berger . Le couteau est une arme mortelle. En apporter un en classe doit conduire à une comparution immédiate et à un emprisonnement, court mais certain . » Et si la prison ne saurait fonctionner pour un enfant de CE1, il est fondamental que le principe de la peine s’applique aussi à l’école, dès le plus jeune âge et dès la première faute.\n« À tous les niveaux, il faut marteler à l’élève que s’il dévie, la sanction va tomber, appuie Ève Vaguerlant . Or force est de constater qu’on ne le fait pas du tout. Ce Quentin, par exemple, qu’a-t-il connu d’autre que du laxisme, des faits qualifiés de ‘petites bêtises’ et jamais sanctionnés ? » Et c’est ainsi qu’un beau jour on se jette sur un élève de 6e pour l’étrangler, et qu’un mauvais matin on poignarde une surveillante « n’importe laquelle « , pour se venger. Il en va de l’école comme de la société, et de la société comme de l’école : la lâcheté tue. La faiblesse est une bombe à retardement. Sans un retour de l’ordre à tous les niveaux, le pire, qui est déjà là, ne pourra que se perpétuer.",

    "text": "(CNN) –– Un grupo de botánicos logró cultivar una especie de árbol que se creía extinta a partir de una semilla de 1.000 años de antigüedad encontrada en una cueva del desierto de Judea en la década de 1980.\nLos investigadores involucrados en el proyecto dicen que creen que la especie de árbol podría haber sido la fuente de un bálsamo curativo mencionado en la Biblia y otros textos antiguos.\nLos visitantes acuden en masa para ver y oler esta flor apestosa Descubierta durante una excavación arqueológica en la región baja de Wadi el-Makkuk, al norte de Jerusalén, se determinó que la antigua semilla estaba en perfectas condiciones. Pero los científicos que llevaron a cabo la nueva investigación no pudieron identificar el tipo de árbol a partir de la semilla. El equipo, dirigido por la Dra. Sarah Sallon, médica que fundó el Centro de Investigación de Medicina Natural Louis L. Borick en el Centro Médico de la Universidad Hadassah en Jerusalén, plantó la semilla para realizar más investigaciones hace más de 10 años.\nSallon dijo que era posible que el árbol pudiera ser la fuente del bíblico “tsori”, un extracto de planta medicinal asociado con la región histórica de Galaad al norte del mar Muerto en el Valle del Rift del Jordán, una zona montañosa y boscosa que fue intensamente cultivada y ahora es parte de Jordania.\nLos hallazgos del equipo, descritos en un estudio publicado el 10 de septiembre en la revista Communications Biology , revelan algunos de los secretos que rodean los orígenes de este enigmático espécimen, al que Sallon apodó “Sheba”.\nEl equipo de estudio midió la semilla antes de plantarla en 2010. En ese momento, no estaba claro cuántos años tenía. Crédito: Guy Eisner. Huella genética sin coincidencias Para germinar el espécimen, la coautora del estudio, la Dra. Elaine Solowey, investigadora emérita del Centro de Agricultura Sostenible del Instituto Arava de Estudios Ambientales en Israel, utilizó un proceso perfeccionado durante una investigación previa dirigida por Sallon sobre semillas de palmeras datileras de 2.000 años de antigüedad. El método implicó remojar la misteriosa semilla del desierto de Judea en agua mezclada con hormonas y fertilizante antes de plantarla en una maceta con tierra esterilizada.\n“Unas cinco semanas y media después, surge este bonito brote”, dijo Sallon. La punta del brote está protegida por una especie de tapa llamada opérculo. Una vez que se desprendió, el equipo utilizó la datación por radiocarbono de la materia orgánica para estimar la edad de la planta y descubrió que el espécimen estaba fechado entre 993 y 1.202 d. C.\nLas plantas emiten sonidos en ciertas circunstancias, según estudio Poco después, el árbol empezó a tener hojas. Sallon compartió imágenes del árbol y sus hojas con botánicos de todo el mundo. Un experto sugirió que pertenecía al género Commiphora. El grupo incluye alrededor de 200 especies de árboles que se encuentran principalmente en África, Madagascar y la península Arábiga.\nSallon compartió luego una muestra de la hoja con la coautora del estudio, la Dra. Andrea Weeks, profesora adjunta del departamento de biología de la Universidad George Mason en Fairfax, Virginia. Weeks secuenció el ADN del árbol, lo que confirmó la identificación preliminar. Sin embargo, la muestra no coincidía con ninguna de las especies de Commiphora conocidas en su base de datos.\nCon su huella genética única, la especie desconocida de Commiphora probablemente representaba un taxón extinto que alguna vez fue nativo de la región que rodea el desierto de Judea, según el estudio.\nSin embargo, el árbol, que ya tiene más de 14 años y casi 3 metros de altura, no ha florecido ni dado frutos. Sin estas características, no es posible identificar con certeza la especie críptica, añade el estudio.\nEl árbol, que los autores del estudio creen que puede tener una conexión bíblica, cuando tenía 12 años de antigüedad.

Basado en investigaciones históricas, Sallon tuvo la corazonada de que el árbol podría ser la fuente de lo que los textos antiguos de la región, incluida la Biblia, describen como “bálsamo de Judea” o “bálsamo de Galaad”, una resina fragante recolectada para elaborar un codiciado perfume que se exportaba a todo el mundo en esa época.\n“Lo plantamos en 2010 y ahora estamos en 2024. ¿Por qué esperamos tanto tiempo para publicar la investigación? Porque quería asegurarme de que no se trataba del bálsamo de Judea. ¿Y cómo podía saberlo con certeza? Oliéndolo”, dijo Sallon.\nUna antigua especie de árbol recién descubierta parece salida de la imaginación de Dr. Seuss Sin embargo, el árbol, que está emparentado con el árbol de la mirra, famoso por su resina, nunca desprendió ningún tipo de olor. Una vez que la planta alcanzó la madurez, alrededor de los 3 años, el equipo realizó un análisis fitoquímico de su resina, hojas y ramas para detectar compuestos aromáticos, como los que se encuentran en la mirra. Sin embargo, no se encontró ninguno, dijo Sallon.\nEn cambio, el equipo detectó algunos compuestos conocidos por su uso medicinal, incluidos los “guggulteroles”, que se identificaron a partir de la resina de la especie de árbol relacionada Commiphora wightii como poseedores de potenciales propiedades para combatir el cáncer, señaló el estudio.\n“Con base en todos estos factores, determinamos que no es el bálsamo de Judea, sino que es un primo cercano de este y una de las Commiphora no aromáticas que es un tesoro de compuestos medicinales”, dijo.\nDebido a la presencia de esos compuestos curativos, Sallon y sus colegas concluyeron que el árbol podría haber sido la fuente de un bálsamo medicinal conocido como tsori, que también se menciona en textos históricos.\nSegún la Dra. Louise Colville, investigadora principal en biología de semillas y estrés en el Real Jardín Botánico de Kew, en Londres, las semillas con una vida útil tan larga son raras. Colville no participó en la investigación.\n“Lo sorprendente de esta historia es que era solo una semilla y poder tener una oportunidad de que germine es extremadamente afortunado”, dijo.\n“Trabajar en un banco de semillas y ver el potencial de esa longevidad extrema nos da la esperanza de que al almacenar y conservar semillas, al menos algunas sobrevivirán durante períodos muy largos de tiempo”.",
