    "text": "Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans, boosting tourism and local business sales Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans, boosting tourism and local business sales Sugar Bowl weekend events expected to pour $200 million into city of New Orleans, boosting tourism and local business sales It's shaping up to be a winning weekend for the city as we gear up for the 90th anniversary of the Sugar Bowl. Not only are we hosting thousands of University of Washington Huskies and University of Texas Longhorn fans for the New Year's Day game, it'll be a win for New Orleans tourism as well. News Orleans and Company projects the weekend's events to generate roughly $200 million in revenue, giving the city a swift kick into the new year. Hotels, restaurants and bars in New Orleans, specifically in the downtown area are seeing high foot traffic and a boost in sales days ahead of Sunday's parade and Monday's big game. The Texas Longhorns are being hosted by the Marriot Hotel and the Huskies are staying at the Hilton Riverside. Those two hotels, in addition to New Orleans' 26,000 hotels within two miles of the Superdome, are nearly, if not already, sold out. Kelly Schulz with New Orleans and Company says she even believes many of these hotels will be sold out before Sunday and Monday. \"Sugar Bowl weekend is here, the fans are here, and we are ready to welcome everyone,\" Schulz said. \"We are seeing very large crowds coming from both Washington and Texas. The game is sold out, and our hotels are at 95 percent occupancy over the weekend. We are seeing very large crowds that are out shopping, enjoying our restaurants and culture.\" There are also many people who are coming to town and staying with relatives and friends, but also spending their dollars with local bars and restaurants. A game of this magnitude also puts the city in the national spotlight.",

    "text": "In June, [multiple](https://x.com/BehizyTweets/status/1798146249025102050) [social](https://x.com/notjessewalker/status/1798155695784939939) [posts](https://x.com/Karen6807/status/1797719168654909510), including [one](https://x.com/LeadingReport/status/1798120579683487748) with more than 10 million views, claimed former [Black Panther Party](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/black-panther-party-challenging-police-and-promoting-social-change) leader [David Hilliard](https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2012.149.6) is endorsing [Donald Trump](/section/donald-trump) in the 2024 presidential election. “BREAKING: Black Panthers founding member David Hilliard is backing Donald Trump for president, calling him an ‘ally of the black population,’” [the viral post said](https://x.com/LeadingReport/status/1798120579683487748). The Black Panther Party was founded in 1966 by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California. It was the era’s most influential militant black power organization, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Hilliard, who was a childhood friend of Newton, served as chief of staff. Recent [search trends show](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&geo=US&q=black%20panther%20donald%20trump&hl=en) some people online are wondering whether these claims are true. THE QUESTION Did former Black Panther Party leader David Hilliard endorse Donald Trump for president? THE SOURCES [Multiple](https://x.com/Cozy4Eva/status/1798172585945084018) [posts](https://x.com/Cozy4Eva/status/1798105488670019696) [on X](https://x.com/Cozy4Eva/status/1798252898125848812)by Eric Jones, David Hilliard’s grandson [Eric Jones interview with Roland S. Martin](https://youtu.be/88pxd5uE8Nk?si=OpjaO_klS_YncXYO), American journalist and commentator [New York Public Library Archives](https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20948) [The Gotham Center for New York City History](https://www.gothamcenter.org/blog/fred-trump-slays-the-king-of-cooperative-housing) THE ANSWER No, former Black Panther Party leader David Hilliard did not endorse Donald Trump for president. WHAT WE FOUND Former Black Panther Party Chief of Staff David Hilliard did not endorse Donald Trump for president like viral posts claim. A video misrepresents Hilliard’s account of Trump’s alleged relationship with the Black Panther Party in New York during the 1960s and his grandson says he has been experiencing cognitive issues since 2014. In a [now-deleted TikTok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@carol.mitchell27/video/7376003739200654635), a woman named Carol Mitchell can be seen in the days following the former president’s [hush money trial conviction](https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0) in New York asking Hilliard to talk about his opinion of Trump. The video was filmed at a senior living facility in the Oakland, California, area. On June 2, Mitchell [shared a link](https://x.com/carolmitch8208/status/1797393584607604737) to the full video on her X account with a caption that reads: “Black Panther David Hilliard endorses @realDonaldTrump Saying: ‘He Likes Blacks.’” In the video, which was also [posted on X](https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1797712425824981438), Hilliard does not endorse Trump for president. Instead, he speaks on Trump’s alleged relationship with the Black Panther Party in New York City during the 1960s. In the video, which appears to be edited because of a jump cut about 43 seconds in, Hilliard told Mitchell that Trump, who was a college student at the time, allegedly supported and gave money to the Black Panther Party. In another clip, Hilliard says Trump is “a friend to African Americans” and “he’s not a racist, fascist white man.” Mitchell can then be heard off camera asking Hilliard, “Why do you think they put all these charges on Trump and they’re afraid of him to be president?” “Because Trump likes Africans in America. He likes Black folks,” Hilliard responds. Though Hilliard speaks positively of the former president, he does not “endorse” Trump for president as the viral posts claim. After the video went viral on social media, Hilliard’s grandson Eric Jones wrote in [multiple](https://x.com/Cozy4Eva/status/1798105488670019696) [posts](https://x.com/Cozy4Eva/status/1798252898125848812) [on his X account](https://x.com/Cozy4Eva/status/1798172585945084018) that his grandfather has been experiencing cognitive issues since 2014. “The lady who interviewed my Grandfather did so without any permission. This was done to take advantage of my Grandfather who suffers from dementia and create a fake narrative in which he endorses/supports Trump in today’s political climate. David Hilliard does not support Donald Trump,” Jones wrote in one of the posts. Jones also [said](https://youtu.be/88pxd5uE8Nk?si=pRaQvQZF6Elzyf-h) on the #RolandMartinUnfiltered Daily Digital Show that Hilliard can only recall the past and is not aware that Trump is now a politician. On June 4, Jones [posted a video](https://x.com/Cozy4Eva/status/1798176967067652257) with Hilliard on X in which he says Mitchell’s interview misrepresents Hilliard’s views on Trump and is not an endorsement. In Jones’s video, Hilliard claims Trump was once a realtor to some members of the Black Panther Party in Harlem during the 1960s. “That is purely speaking in terms of the past,” Jones said. “That is not a nod of support to any of today’s political climate with Donald Trump or any other candidate.” “That’s correct,” Hilliard says in response. VERIFY found that the Black Panther Party did have a branch in Harlem in the late 1960s, according to [files and papers](https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20948) collected by the New York Public Library. We also found that Donald Trump’s father, [Fred C. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/26/nyregion/fred-c-trump-postwar-master-builder-of-housing-for-middle-class-dies-at-93.html), owned [several](https://www.gothamcenter.org/blog/fred-trump-slays-the-king-of-cooperative-housing) [apartment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/10/the-middle-class-housing-empire-donald-trump-abandoned-for-luxury-building/) [buildings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/10/the-middle-class-housing-empire-donald-trump-abandoned-for-luxury-building/) in Brooklyn and Queens in the 1960s. However, it is unclear whether the Trump family owned properties in Harlem and if they were ever associated with the Black Panther Party. VERIFY reached out to Mitchell, Jones and the Trump campaign for comment but did not hear back by the time of publication.",
