    "title": "Hombre es encarcelado en Reino Unido por quitarse el preservativo sin consentimiento: Está tipificado como violación",
    "text": "Un tribunal británico ordenó este jueves que un hombre fuera encarcelado por quitarse el preservativo sin consentimiento durante una relación sexual, un caso que la policía de Londres calificó de \"hito\" legal.\nGuy Mukendi, de 39 años y residente en el sur de Londres, fue condenado a cuatro años y tres meses de cárcel tras ser declarado culpable en abril, informó la policía de la capital británica.\nLa policía londinense dijo que la joven dio el consentimiento de mantener relaciones sexuales con Mukendi bajo la condición de que utilizara un preservativo. Sin embargo, durante el acto sexual, el hombre se lo quitó sin que la víctima lo supiera.\nLa retirada no consentida del preservativo está tipificada como violación en Inglaterra y Gales.\nFue en mayo del año pasado cuando una joven presentó una denuncia de agresión sexual en Brixton, en el sur de Londres desencadenando una investigación contra el sospechoso.\nSegún indica la BBC, los agentes recopilaron y analizaron pruebas forenses e intercambios de mensajes de textos que se mostraron en el tribunal. En uno de ellos Mukendi señaló que se sacó el preservativo ya que no había tenido relaciones sexuales en mucho tiempo, prueba que contribuyó a asegurar la condena del hombre.\n\"El caso marca un hito\" Cabe mencionar que la policía declaró que estos enjuiciamientos son \"muy inusuales\" debido a la falta de denuncias, pero que están comprometidos a buscar \"justicia\" para las víctimas.\n\" Este caso marca un hito y se produce mientras la policía metropolitana continúa su compromiso de centrarse más en los sospechosos de delitos que afectan de forma desproporcionada a mujeres y niñas\", declaró la policía en un comunicado.\n\"Durante la investigación, Mukendi negó todo acto ilícito, pero nuestros agentes construyeron un caso convincente contra él para que no quedaran dudas para el jurado\", manifestó el detective Jack Earl, que dirigió la investigación.\n\"Estábamos decididos a hacer justicia para la víctima y seguiremos concientizando de que este delito es una forma de violación. La víctima hizo lo correcto al llamar a la policía de inmediato y su valentía no debe quedar eclipsada\", agregó.",

    "text": "Micron Technology (MU, Financial) shares experienced a notable increase, rising by 4.13%. This movement in stock price is influenced by recent developments including potential tariff reductions on Chinese goods and positive signals from the Trump administration regarding economic policies.\nMicron Technology's strategic shift in production is seen as a positive move. By reducing DDR4 memory solutions production and focusing on higher-margin DDR5 and HBM chips, the company is aligning itself with industry demands driven by artificial intelligence trends. This shift demonstrates Micron's agility in responding to market dynamics and enhancing its product portfolio.\nIn terms of financial metrics, Micron Technology (MU, Financial) is currently priced at $73.11, reflecting a market capitalization of approximately $81.71 billion. The company has a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 17.53, which is close to a two-year low, indicating potential undervaluation.\nNotably, Micron's GF Value indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued, suggesting a potential upside for investors. Interested readers can further explore the GF Value of Micron Technology.\nFurthermore, Micron Technology's financial strength is underscored by a robust Altman Z-score of 3.77, indicating a strong position in terms of bankruptcy risk. The company’s Piotroski F-Score of 7 also points to a healthy financial situation, further supported by its strong balance sheet.\nDespite the positive outlook, it's important to note a few warning signs, such as the company's return on invested capital (ROIC) being less than its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which suggests potential inefficiencies in capital utilization. Additionally, insider selling activities have been observed, which could be a point of consideration for potential investors.\nOverall, Micron Technology (MU, Financial) remains a significant player in the semiconductor industry, with strategic shifts and financial metrics offering an optimistic outlook amidst changing market conditions.",

    "text": "Bad Actors Luring Youth on Telegram: An Arms Race to Truth Telegram, a platform with notoriously lax content moderation, has done little to address the sweeping spread of misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war Telegram, one of the world’s most used online messaging apps, is facing controversy after company founder Pavel Durov said in an interview that the app employs only around 30 engineers. That comment, made in an April 2024 interview with Tucker Carlson, raised concerns about Telegram’s underinvestment in user privacy and security. Telegram is known for its encrypted messaging and is used by individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide, with approximately 800 million monthly active users and over 2 billion total downloads—meaning that security problems resulting from lack of manpower could have widespread consequences. It’s not just the admitted lack of employees that’s gotten Telegram into hot water recently. Telegram’s moderation policies have been lax since the app’s conception, and the app’s privacy and encryption policies are known to attract groups looking to spread hateful content. The platform has faced issues of misinformation and hate speech, especially antisemitic speech following October 7, 2023. According to the Telegram website, the app uses a “combination of AI-driven and manual moderation” to counter misuse of the platform. “We will always favor the least restrictive measure possible to sustain a safe digital environment and decisively address malicious content,” the online statement said. Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War Journal, told The Media Line that Telegram has resisted restricting the spread of content promoting violence. Hamas … has circulated violent videos showcasing attacks on civilians and Israeli troops via its Telegram channels “Hamas, for instance, has circulated violent videos showcasing attacks on civilians and Israeli troops via its Telegram channels,” Truzman said. As far back as the 2014 Gaza war, Hamas and other armed groups used social media to share real-time videos and messages from Gaza. Several of Telegram’s features lend itself to use by bad actors, including end-to-end encryption, limited moderation, support for large groups, and the ability to prevent screenshots. “Palestinian terrorist organizations have demonstrated remarkable sophistication in their use of these platforms,” Truzman said. “Today, channels like Telegram are frequently employed to release videos of attacks and official statements from these groups.” Shmuel Gihon, research team leader at the Israeli digital risk platform Cyberint, told The Media Line that Telegram’s commitment to anonymity and free speech “makes it both an amazing platform and a perfect platform to perform malicious acts and spread misinformation.” He said that Telegram has “the worst content moderation out of the platforms available.” Since October 7, the platform has been used to anonymously spread anti-Israel misinformation about the Gaza war Since October 7, the platform has been used to anonymously spread anti-Israel misinformation about the Gaza war, Gihon said. A brief investigation by The Media Line found active Telegram channels promoting pro-Palestine student encampments at universities in New York, Texas, and Washington, DC. Some fliers shared in the group had designs featuring the Hezbollah flag. Groups also featured a call to protest New York’s Nova Exhibition, an installation detailing the Hamas massacre at the Nova music festival. One example of a Telegram channel that promotes violent content is the Resistance News Network (RNN). According to the Anti-Defamation League, RNN is a radical antisemitic, anti-Zionist channel that promotes violence against Israel. Launched in October 2022, RNN has over 165,000 subscribers and claims to have been deplatformed from Instagram and Twitter (now X). The channel shares content from US State Department-designated foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs), including Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. RNN’s posts include propaganda and graphics of armed individuals and rocket attacks on Israel. In February 2024, RNN materials appeared offline at the Auraria Campus in Denver. Groups sharing RNN content include Students for Justice in Palestine chapters at various universities, The Mapping Project, Samidoun, and Jewish Voice for Peace Metro DC. RNN’s toolkit promoting pro-Hamas propaganda was found on UConn’s Telegram group UCommune. Officially, Hamas has been banned from major social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, yet content supporting the group continues to reach large audiences online. Accounts sympathetic to Hamas have gained significant followings since the conflict with Israel began on October 7. A Telegram channel named Gaza Now, aligned with Hamas, saw its followers increase from 340,000 to over 1.8 million. This channel distributes Hamas propaganda and gruesome content. Mainstream platforms attempt to limit extremist content, but Telegram remains a key outlet for violent pro-Hamas messaging. Efforts to moderate such content are complicated, with platforms struggling to balance policy enforcement and the spread of false information. As social media companies grapple with these challenges, they often face criticism for both overzealous and insufficient content moderation measures. In order to make the misinformation more palatable, people posting anti-Israel content on social media use emotionally driven language that appeals to users’ preexisting beliefs, Gihon said. Such language was evident in the content found by The Media Line in these channels, including in claims that Israel operates “torture camps for children.” One post showed a fake screenshot of an Israeli news agency showing purported Israeli support for raping Palestinians. Other posts showed graphic photos of child victims of the Syrian civil war, falsely claiming that the subjects were Palestinian children in Gaza. Many posts were shared in multiple channels or included hyperlinks directing recipients of forwarded messages back to the original Telegram group. These methods increase the misinformation’s reach. Gihon said that “funded channels” are spreading anti-Israel misinformation in an attempt to influence groups such as university students. In rare cases, Telegram does respond to abusive content shared on its platform. In 2015, the platform shut down 78 channels related to the Islamic State (IS) group after the Middle East Media Research Institute called attention to the spread of IS propaganda on Telegram. In 2022, the app banned 64 accounts at Germany’s request for spreading extremist content and COVID-19 disinformation. Following October 7, Telegram took some steps to limit the spread of content by groups connected to Hamas, but only after Google and Apple intervened, Truzman said. He accused Telegram of facilitating the spread of anti-Israel misinformation to Western audiences. Some Telegram channels have similarly been used to share support for anti-Hindu hate crimes in Bangladesh, promoting the message that the Muslim attackers were “freeing Bangladesh from its last colonialists.” Hamas and other armed groups also use social media to recruit local supporters, including recruitment of children to Hamas-run summer camps. But Gihon said that terrorist groups see social media as better used for influencing international audiences, “especially given that local populations also have their local news and their surroundings to better judge for themselves the information being spread.” He said that some state actors use Telegram both to gain support among well-meaning Westerners and to carry out concealed state-sponsored espionage. The Media Line was able to quickly confirm that some anti-Israel Telegram channels are used to target specific individuals and organizations. Posts shared in these groups listed individuals’ names, places of employment, phone numbers, and more, alongside calls to silence members of the lists or flood their online presence with antisemitic content. Targeted individuals included performers, mayors, police officers, and board members at universities. Telegram groups can include up to 200,000 members, and Telegram channels have an unlimited audience. Messages shared in one Telegram group can quickly spread, allowing for the efficient dissemination of propaganda and misinformation. Given Telegram’s commitment to anonymity and free speech, experts don’t expect Telegram to emulate Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, or X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, in the field of content moderation. “Technological solutions will be the identification of bot activity and bot accounts in the more mainstream platforms such as Meta, Instagram, TikTok, and X,” Gihon said. “When it comes to Telegram, I don’t think there is a solution to this issue, other than for stakeholders to put in the work to expose the use of Telegram as a platform that is being leveraged with malicious intentions.” Some countries have banned Telegram, but that move hasn’t been particularly effective. According to the Trust and Safety Foundation (TSF), an organization that tracks online hate speech and misinformation, users looking to share hate speech or promote violence often switch social media platforms once one platform shuts down or introduces moderation. Around the January 6 US Capitol attack, Amazon refused to continue hosting Parler, a microblogging site favored by the far right, leading millions of users to switch to Telegram, TSF said. That influx of former Parler users helped Telegram reach 500 million active users. Uri Klempner, a cyber politics graduate at Tel Aviv University who has published work on Telegram’s hate speech problem, explained to The Media Line that “the prevalence of these groups on Telegram is actually a byproduct of attempts to combat their spread on what we consider the mainstream internet. Policies of ‘de-platforming’ extremist groups from mainstream platforms drove them toward more ‘tolerant’ platforms such as Telegram. What we see now is a significant improvement in these groups’ ability to control information and convey their narratives.” Many users, especially in the Arab world, use Telegram as a primary source of news and information. Due to the app’s broad audience reach, it is becoming a major asset in gaining public legitimacy and controlling narratives. According to Klempner, “Terror groups have accustomed audiences to that by using their channels as the primary form of communication. This is an unprecedented normalization of consuming terrorist-produced content and information, which inherently is extremist and borderline propaganda in many cases. It is a concerning tool for coordination of extremism—recruitment, operations, and more.” Experts like Gihon and Klempner see this situation as equivalent to an arms race to the truth. With new moderation tools unlikely to be rolled out and state bans ineffective, accurate information is the best way to fight fake news on Telegram, Gihon said. It’s pretty obvious that anti-Israeli entities worldwide are winning this race “It’s pretty obvious that anti-Israeli entities worldwide are winning this race,” he said. “To mitigate and counter it, Israel should put a lot of funds and efforts into spreading the truth regarding these claims and issues.” “Telegram as a platform is unfortunately not that concerned with regulating this content, as its founder and CEO Pavel Durov has made clear many times,” said Klempner. According to him, Telegram often downplays the radicalizing potential of these channels. “In October 2023, when they were under a lot of pressure to take down Hamas-affiliated channels, they defended keeping them up as they could serve as an important channel to convey important information.” In a statement from October 23, Durov stated, “Hamas used Telegram to warn civilians in Ashkelon to leave the area ahead of their missile strikes. Would shutting down their channel help save lives—or would it endanger more lives?” “I think this statement is facetious, ignoring the fact that this warning was, in fact, psychological terror and had nothing to do with humanitarian concern. I find it hard to believe Durov is not aware of that and is simply trying to create excuses to allow extremist content on his platform. Ultimately, the solution lies with them. There is obviously a much larger debate on the effectiveness of de-platforming as a practice, but pressure needs to be put on Telegram to take its role more seriously as it emerges as a platform that significantly alters and impacts public discourse,” Klempner concluded. Gihon has called for investigations into the funders of online anti-Israel misinformation, which he said might include the Iranian government, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Ultimately, it’s up to Telegram users to protect themselves from misinformation Ultimately, it’s up to Telegram users to protect themselves from misinformation, Gihon said. “We should be extra careful and aware of the reputation of the platforms that we use in our daily lives,” he said. “Critical thinking is key, especially when we get our content from Telegram.” Sam Baeza contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Sector público concreta primer paro por reajuste y cambios a “confianza legítima” - La Tercera",
    "text": "Daniela del Solar Hace 2 horas Tiempo de lectura: 3 minutos Esto en medio de las negociaciones que llevan adelante con el gobierno, las que continúan este viernes. El presidente de la CUT califica como exitosa la movilización de este jueves del sector público que contó, según indicó, con la participación de 60 mil personas a nivel nacional.\ncompartir Comentarios Durante la jornada de este jueves se llevó a cabo el paro nacional de los trabajadores del sector público, convocado por la Agrupación Nacional de Empleados Fiscales (ANEF) en conjunto con la Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT) .\nEl llamado a paralizar tenía por objetivo convocar a una marcha durante este jueves. La movilización partió a las 11 de la mañana y avanzó por la Alameda. En un comunicado de la CUT indicaron que el principal motivo era “manifestar y hacer visible en malestar sobre la precarización constante de la cual son víctima los funcionarios públicos y la inestabilidad laboral”.\nEl presidente de la CUT, David Acuña , calificó como exitosa la movilización, detallando que según sus cálculos hubo “ más de 30 mil personas movilizadas de distintas maneras . También en distintas comunas. Pero esto también se replicó a nivel nacional”. Según la central, a lo largo del país participaron alrededor de 60 mil trabajadores.\nEsta paralización se enmarca en la negociación del reajuste salarial que comenzó oficialmente a fines de la semana pasada, con la entrega del petitorio de los funcionarios públicos. Los trabajadores piden un reajuste de 7,5% nominal, es decir, 3% real .\nFrente a esa propuesta, parlamentarios de oposición ya advirtieron que rechazarían el monto pedido por los trabajadores.\n“Hoy lamentablemente parlamentarios y parlamentarias de derecha sobre todo, que denostan la función pública, (...) hoy siguen en el Parlamento hablando mal de la función pública y negándole tanto los recursos como hoy día diciendo que no van a legislar en torno a un reajuste que es justo y necesario”, declaró Acuña. Además, el dirigente agregó que “ni siquiera hemos construido un acuerdo o desacuerdo y ya están diciendo que lo van a rechazar”.\nA su vez, el presidente de la multisindical, explicó que “la movilización tiene tres componentes. Hoy día necesitamos contar con un reajuste real para los funcionarios públicos. Necesitamos que realmente se cumplan los compromisos del Estado, sobre todo en temas de jornada laboral”. En la agenda laboral también incluyen temas como la norma de salud mental y equidad de género.\nLa historia continua más abajo\nMás sobre CUT La rebelión comunista contra ministra Jeannette Jara (PC) por cuestionar paro del sector público Hace 7 horas Dónde poner atención: las claves de hoy, jueves 28 de noviembre de 2024 Hace 14 horas Otro de los motivos de la convocatoria a paralizar fue el dictamen realizado por la contralora, Dorothy Pérez, que cambia el criterio de los trabajadores a contrata y la “confianza legítima” y que podría afectar la estabilidad laboral de los funcionarios a contrata (plazo fijo). “Hoy día la estabilidad laboral para los trabajadores públicos es un tema muy sensible”, señaló Acuña.\nReacción del Ejecutivo La convocatoria a paro del sector público en el marco de las negociaciones del reajuste salarial fue cuestionada por los ministros de Hacienda y Trabajo.\nEn entrevista con radio ADN el titular de Hacienda, Mario Marcel, declaró que no le ve respaldo a la movilización. “ Protestar por algo que planteó un sector de la oposición a través de una movilización que afecta al público en general, es algo que es difícil de entender ”, señaló el ministro.\nEn la misma línea, la ministra del Trabajo y Previsión Social, Jeannette Jara, también se refirió a la paralización de los funcionarios fiscales afirmando que “ la convocatoria a un paro antes de sentarse a conversar, la verdad, no le encuentro mucho sentido, toda vez que estas conversaciones recién se van a empezar a producir”.\nPor su parte, Acuña no estuvo de acuerdo con la postura del Ejecutivo, planteando que “lamentamos que los ministros digan no entender por qué efectivamente los trabajadores y trabajadoras públicas llegamos a realizar un paro”. Además, asegura que les llama la atención que “una ministra que fue dirigenta sindical no entienda la movilización”.\n“Creemos que hoy día el Gobierno tiene una oportunidad de fortalecer el empleo público. Es por eso que nosotros hoy día también nos hemos movilizado”, agregó.\nEste viernes continúan las reuniones de los representantes de los funcionarios del sector público con el Gobierno para conversar sobre el petitorio entregado por la ANEF. No obstante, Acuña advierte que ellos se han declarado en estado de alerta, afirmando que “nosotros creemos fuertemente en el diálogo. Hemos dialogado, hemos avanzado, pero también creemos en la movilización”.\nComenta Los comentarios en esta sección son exclusivos para suscriptores.

    "text": "Ricardo Castellá y Grison en 'La Revuelta' (RTVE) Una de las grandes preocupaciones de los fans de La Resistencia era si con su entrada a RTVE perderían la libertad en su humor. No obstante, el programa de David Broncano ha demostrado que este paso al acces prime time de La 1 no ha sido ningún impedimento para seguir adelante con sus comentarios casposos sobre drogas e incluso política. Y es que, al comentar una mujer del público que le gustaría volver en dos años con su hijo “si sigue el programa” , ha desatado la histeria en los colaboradores.\nSegún apuntaron algunos personajes de medios de comunicación tras el anuncio del fichaje del formato por la cadena pública, todo se trataba de una estrategia de la Moncloa para conseguir quitar audiencia a El Hormiguero por sus palabras contra el Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. Esto mismo, es lo que criticó el presentador de La Revuelta hace unos días en The Times : “ Ellos fueron los primeros que dijeron, al aire, que Pedro Sánchez me ponía en TVE . Están contribuyendo a polarizar la situación ”.\nSin embargo, Broncano solo necesitó dos semanas para demostrar que ha llegado para quedarse y recibir el apoyo del público español, al arrebatar diariamente el liderazgo en la franja de coincidencia al programa de Pablo Motos . Ahora, el espacio de RTVE no deja de lanzar indirectas sobre eso, y no han dudado en compartir lo que ocurriría con su trabajo si el Partido Popular llegara al Gobierno en las próximas elecciones.\n“ Entra el PP y a tomar ‘porculo’. En cuanto entre Feijóo nos meten aquí a los de Desokupa. Meten aquí a Los Morancos, una vaquilla..”, ha bromeado Grison. A lo que ha continuado Broncano: “ Sale Sánchez y entra Bertín Osborne” . Pero ha regulado y ha asegurado al público que él confía en que no los echarían, posiblemente gracias al gran éxito en esta franja de emisión que llevaba sin ver La 1 bastantes años.\nNo hemos podido empezar mejor la temporada entre la audiencia y el Ondas, pero no podemos ponernos flamencos.\nPIES EN LA TIERRA. #LaRevuelta pic.twitter.com/NBvzbVya2Z\n— La Revuelta (@LaRevuelta_TVE) October 24, 2024 Unos invitados muy diferentes Juan Enrique Soto ha sido el primero en ser entrevistado esta noche de jueves. El destacado investigador de conductas criminales ha dedicado su carrera a fusionar la criminología con la psicología forense. Con 28 años de servicio en la Policía Nacional de España , Soto ha sido pionero en el uso de la psicología para perfilar a criminales, un enfoque que ha demostrado ser crucial en la resolución de casos complejos. Este método innovador es el tema central de la nueva serie documental SAC: En la mente del criminal , que se estrenará el 30 de octubre en La 2 y RTVE Play .\nLa serie explora la creación y el trabajo de la Sección de Análisis de Conducta (SAC) de la Policía Nacional, un grupo especializado que estudia los patrones de comportamiento de los delincuentes para ayudar en su captura. Este enfoque se basa en el análisis de detalles como el olor, las palabras pronunciadas por el agresor, las horas y fechas de los ataques, y otros elementos que permiten esbozar un perfil psicológico del criminal. Y además de esta, también ha presentado su libro Vivir en el asombro. Memorias de un psicólogo criminalista.\nHay mucha gente que se va a dormir escuchando podcasts de true crime. Hay mucha gente que se pregunta si tiene un problema como @bad_gyal_pussy #LaRevuelta @JuanEnriqsoto pic.twitter.com/FVDETetMGw\n— La Revuelta (@LaRevuelta_TVE) October 24, 2024 Tras él, ha entrado en el Teatro Príncipe de Gran Vía Bad Gyal. La barcelonesa ha estrenado su primer documental, La Joia. La joven ha confesado que es una gran fan del true crime y suele escuchar pódcast del género para poder conciliar el sueño por la noche. Ante esto, Soto le ha recomendado: “Tal y como lo ha planteado, yo me lo haría mirar. Pero dado a la afición que hay, no es tanto...”.\nSu nuevo trabajo se adentra en la creación de su último disco. “Es meterse dentro del día a día de mi equipo y mío, sobre la creación de mi disco, La Joia ”, ha descrito la cantante de Flow 2000 . Sin embargo, y contra lo que se podría pensar, la joven afirma que gana “mucho menos de lo que muevo. Creo que todavía no soy millonaria ”. No obstante, le ha asegurado a Broncano que es cuestión de tiempo.",
