    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Franklin County, Kentucky from 1901-2000 was 34.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Franklin County, Kentucky experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Franklin County, Kentucky history.",

    "text": "AFP News Hamas considering latest Gaza truce offer in 'positive spirit' AFP News 3 May 2024 at 8:17 am Link copied Read full article\nHamas says it is considering in a \"positive spirit\" a Gaza truce deal, while the UN warned rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory would require efforts not seen since World War II.\nAfter months of stop-start negotiations, Hamas has sounded an optimistic tone about the latest hostages-for-ceasefire proposal, raising hopes an agreement may soon be reached -- even as medics in the besieged strip reported fresh strikes on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah on Friday.\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group will \"soon\" send a delegation to Egypt to complete ongoing ceasefire discussions with a deal that \"realises the demands of our people\".\nHaniyeh, the leader of the militant group's political wing, told Egyptian and Qatari mediators in calls on Thursday that Hamas was studying the latest proposal from Israel with a \"positive spirit\".\nThe stakes of the truce talks were thrown into sharp relief Thursday, when a UN report estimated it could take 80 years to reconstruct all the homes flattened over the course of the nearly seven-month war.\n\"The scale of the destruction is huge and unprecedented... this is a mission that the global community has not dealt with since World War II,\" Abdallah al-Dardari, the UNDP's Regional Director for Arab States told a briefing in Jordan.\nThe UNDP assessment forecast the socioeconomic toll inflicted will cost generations of Palestinians to come and called for an urgent ceasefire.\n- 'Suffering' -\nThe only truce mediators have been able to hammer out so far was a week-long deal in November, that saw the release of 105 hostages for 240 Palestinian prisoners.\nIsrael estimates that 129 captives seized by the militants during their October 7 attack remain in Gaza.\nThe military says 35 of them are dead, including 49-year-old Dror Or.\nThe government confirmed Or's death early Friday. Two of his children were among the hostages released during the November truce.\nHamas and Israel have been at loggerheads for months over the terms of any new deal.\nThe militant group has demanded a permanent ceasefire to end the war and the withdrawal of troops, which Israel has refused.\nWhile Israel faces regular protests demanding the government bring home remaining captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to fight on.\nWith or without a truce, he has said he will send ground troops into Rafah, despite global concerns over the fate of around 1.5 million civilians sheltering there.\nThe truce offer under consideration includes a 40-day halt to fighting and the exchange of Israeli hostages for potentially thousands of Palestinian prisoners, according to details released by Britain.\nDuring his latest whirlwind visit to the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the Palestinian group to accept what he termed an \"extraordinarily generous\" deal on the part of Israel.\n\"If Hamas actually purports to care about the Palestinian people and wants to see an immediate alleviation of their suffering, it will take the deal,\" Blinken told reporters Wednesday.\nUntil Haniyeh's comments, Gaza-rulers Hamas had indicated a generally negative reception of the proposed truce.\nThe war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\nIsrael's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\nUNDP estimated that as of April 12, at least five percent of Gaza's population had been killed or injured.\n\"The suffering in Gaza will not end when the war does,\" UNDP chief Achim Steiner said.\n\"Unprecedented levels of human losses, capital destruction, and the steep rise in poverty in such a short period of time will precipitate a serious development crisis,\" he added.\n- 'Mouths left hungry' -\nThe humanitarian crisis and rising death toll in Gaza have prompted demonstrations around the world, including in universities in the United States, Canada and France.\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog slammed the protests, charging that the US universities had been \"contaminated by hatred and anti-Semitism\".\nColombia severed diplomatic ties with Israel on Wednesday, while Turkey on Thursday announced it was suspending trade.\nGaza's 2.4 million inhabitants are threatened by famine, but international aid has only been able to trickle in.\nUnder US pressure, Israel has allowed increased aid deliveries in recent days, including through a reopened border crossing.\nAt south Gaza's largest hospital, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis, which was heavily damaged by fighting in February, foreign aid and borrowed equipment has helped to \"almost completely\" restore the emergency department, its director Atef al-Hout said.\nUS charity World Central Kitchen resumed delivering food to starving Gazans this week, after it had suspended operations following an Israeli strike in April that killed seven of its staffers.\n\"We realised after the kitchen closed that many mouths were left hungry,\" kitchen manager Zakria Yahya Abukuwaik said, while preparing food in Rafah.\nburs-lb/pjm",

    "title": "Florida priest accused of biting woman during dispute over Communion bread",
    "text": "(CNN) — A Florida priest is accused of biting a woman while giving out Communion during a Mass in St. Cloud in an alleged “attempt to defend the Communion bread,” according to the charging affidavit in the case. The priest, identified as Father Fidel Rodriguez, initially refused to give the woman Communion bread on May 19 and told her “she did not do the prior steps necessary” to receive the bread when he encountered her at a Mass held earlier that day at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, according to police. A statement provided by the Diocese of Orlando states Rodriguez gave the woman a blessing at the 10 a.m. Mass and “advised her to receive the Sacrament of Penance (Confession) before coming back to receive Holy Communion (Eucharist).” The woman told police she returned to the church for the noon Mass and informed the priest she had in fact done the necessary steps and “is now accepted by God, thus, granting her the ability to participate in communion,” the affidavit states. The priest asked the woman if she “had been to the Sacrament of Penance (Confession), to which she stated it was not his business,” according to the statement from the Diocese. The woman told police Rodriguez allegedly “became upset and tried to ram the ‘cookie’ in her mouth,” according to the affidavit. She said she then attempted to grab another Communion bread, which the priest was holding, when he grabbed and bit her arm, the affidavit states. “Father Rodriguez offered the woman Holy Communion on the tongue. At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them,” according to the Diocese’s statement on the incident. “Having only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed,” the statement continued. The woman was asked to leave, according to the Diocese, which added the priest had not met her before. When interviewed by police, the priest told the investigating officer the woman had pushed him and “would not let go of the communion tray and the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,” according to the affidavit. “In the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered ‘the source and summit’ of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion,” the statement from the Diocese reads. “It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it,” the statement adds. The woman refused medical attention and police photographed the bite mark, according to the affidavit. St. Cloud Police have forwarded the affidavit summary of events to the State Attorney’s Office for review. The Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney’s Office told CNN in a statement on Friday, “We have received the case and it is currently under review to determine the appropriate course of action.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "AIDS deaths declining globally except in Eastern Europe and Central Asia SHOBHA SHUKLA - CNS Why are AIDS-deaths rising in Eastern Europe and Central Asia? When AIDS deaths can decline in other parts of the world, then why not here? ( [Image](visuals/2024/08/2024-08-91838-500-Uploaded-populum_visuals_2024_08_2024-08-91838-photo-for-the-article-35.jpg)by [CNS](https://www.citizen-news.org)) [Details](/populum/attrdetails.php?vid=180527) [DMCA](/populum/dmca.php?vid=180527) AIDS-related deaths have declined worldwide except in Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. The latest data from joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) released last month shows that as compared to 2010, AIDS-related deaths have declined globally by more than half (51%) by 2023 but increased by 34.4% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. The steepest decline in AIDS-related deaths during the period 2010-2023 among all the regions globally was in Eastern and Southern Africa (59%), followed closely by the Caribbean (57%) and Western and Central Africa (55%). This drop in AIDS-related deaths was 51% in Asia and the Pacific, 34% in Western and Central Europe and North America, 28% in Latin America and a mere 6% in Middle East and North Africa. AIDS-related deaths are declining in all but one region - Eastern Europe and Central Asian region. This is a proxy for successful dissemination of lifesaving antiretroviral treatments across affected communities. Not just AIDS-related deaths, even the number of new HIV infections has risen by 20% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia which is home to 2.1 million people living with HIV (5% of global population of people with HIV). There were 140,000 newly infected people with HIV in 2023 in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (out of 1.3 million people who got newly infected in 2023 worldwide). HIV adult prevalence in the region has increased from 0.5% in 2010 to 1.2% by 2023. The number of new HIV infections in 2023 has increased in the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America regions also. However, in the rest of the regions the number of new HIV infections have shown a decline. \"In Asia and the Pacific region, there was a 14% decline in new HIV infections in 2022 but in 2023 it was 13%. So, the decline is stagnating. That is the challenge,\" said Eamonn Murphy, Director of UNAIDS Regional office of Eastern Europe and Central Asia and of Asia and the Pacific.

Parts of Australia are set to face wet and potentially wild weather on New Years Eve and New Year's Day. BoM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms are possible for parts of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible in Queensland between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" Ms Scully said. \"Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia.\" Showers and storms are possible across parts of southern and eastern Australia, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria on December 29. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend concentrating in north-east NSW, and south-east and central Queensland. BoM said there are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday. BoM has encouraged the community to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings using the BOM Weather app and website. Queensland will also experience heatwave conditions along the east coast affecting Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and areas surrounding Cairns. Northern and Western Australia will also face heatwave conditions with temperatures reaching the mid to high 40 degree Celsius in some areas. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nCuando un régimen como el de Irán te pinta la cara frente a todo el mundo es que la moralidad de tu país es un saco de mierda en el sótano del infierno, así, sin más. Y ya no engañas a nadie fuera de tus votantes más extremistas.\nMuchos deberían hacerse mirar a quién y qué cojones están apoyando y reflexionar en la intimidad de su dormitorio, en vez de ir negativizando noticias del Menéame y pidiendo que baneen a quienes denunciamos al Estado genocida, supremacista y expansionista de Israel.\n[#1](c1#c-1) [#2](c2#c-2) [#7](c7#c-7) seguís mirando a través de las gafas de la propaganda occidental, propaganda que tienen controlada los EEUU, por cierto. Esa en la que todos son muy malísimos y todos van por si interés, pero en la que siempre, siempre los EEUU son los menos malos. Esa no os la despegais del ideario ni con agua caliente y es precisamente donde está la raíz del problema.\nAñado a\n[#61](c61#c-61).\nTanta propaganda hollywoodiense salvandonos de los meteoritos, aliens, villanos con poderes y luchando por la libertad y objetivos nobles. Con gente tan simpática que nos hacen reír en sus comedias, gente con fantasía e imaginación que nos hacen viajar a mundos imaginarios, al espacio, gente que tiene sentimientos muy profundos y sinceros, haciéndonos vivir escenas de amor, abogados que luchan por los derechos e injusticias y que ha base de lucha y empeño consiguen justicia, en el país de la justicia. Es decir, gente como nosotros, con la que cualquiera se sentiría identificado. Esta gente por narices tiene un transfondo de buenas intenciones, seguro, y por tanto solo pueden ser los menos malos. Además siempre contado por ellos. Este es uno de los pilares, si no el más importante, del imperio, el mediático.\nEn contraposición tenemos un país desconocido, que por consecuencia genera desconfianza y del que solo tenemos noticias malas y que parece que tienen muy malas intenciones. Además si no nos ha llegado su cultura, su comida, es porque nadie la debe querer, debe ser peor que la del resto, no como la yanki que la quiere medio mundo y está por todas partes.\nLuego así pasa, que sale una noticia sin contexto, sin contrastar, y mala para \"el régimen\" con represión para los gays, o para la mujer y hay que sacar las antorchas y afilar los cuchillos. Pero cuando en yankilandia hay problemas con la violencia policial, con los negros todos los días o vemos lo que no respetan ningún derecho humano como con Guantanamo y con las guerras que montan por el mundo lo único que hacemos es soltar la hamburguesa para darle un trago a la Coca-Cola.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Irán justificando un atentado que él mismo apoyó y planeó. Grear surprise.\nAdemás, algo me dice que el discurso de irán lleva siendo el mismo con y sin muertos palestinos durante décadas: \"muerte a Israel\".\n[#1](c1#c-1) Iran, que financia y entrena a Hammas, Hezbollah y los huties y uno de los principales actores de todo esto.\nClaro que se le puede reprochar siendo uno de los bandos del conflicto y quien seguramente está detrás del 7 de Octubre.\n[#51](c51#c-51) si nos ponemos a mirar países que financian a grupos que luego resultan son terroristas, igual nos sorprende la historia.\nTe acuerdas de Osama Bin añaden y Afganistán?\n[#51](c51#c-51) Puedes considerar que financia el terrorismo o puedes considerar que arma a grupos para resistir una ocupación, pero como la situación es la que es, la ayuda a veces llega a manos de gente un poco tarada. Lo mismo podría decirse de la ayuda de USA a Ucrania y las tropas neonazis de su ejército. Personalmente creo que si Irán no hiciera esto no habríamos visto cosas como las del 7 de octubre, pero tampoco quedaría un solo palestino a menos de 600km de TelAviv.\n[#63](c63#c-63) DIficil saber que pasaria sin Iran. El caso es que Iran, Hammas, Hezbollah y los huties tienen como objetivo vital eliminar a Israel e incluso a los judios. Iran paga a Hammas para atacar a Israel, no para que en Gaza tengan buena vida. Usan a los palestinos como carne de cañón.\nAsi que no los veo como parte de la solución, sino del problema.\n[#65](c65#c-65) Irán no tiene como objetivo eliminar a los judíos, de hecho es el país con más judíos de oriente medio detrás de Israel, y tienen un representante en el parlamento.\nEn todo lo demás, claramente sí.\n[#1](c1#c-1) demagogia nivel Dios, Irán es una gran implicada en todo lo que está pasando, de dónde creéis que sacan la enorme cantidad de cohetes que lanzan sobre Israel unos muertos de hambre como los gazaties?\nEncima hablando de putas las tacones, irán hablando de justicia.... sería para reír si no fuera tan triste.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No por ser Iran; pero cuando países que flagrantemente desprecian los derechos humanos, masacran minorías y un largo etc (que sí, que todo el mundo lo termina haciendo en mayor o menor medida, si nos ponemos a buscar la aguja en la paja)\nPues como que me da un\n\"No sé Rick... parece falso\"\nEstados Unidos e Israel quieren y necesitan la guerra. El mundo debe evitar entrar en la espiral belicista en que pretenden hacernos caer y que sólo les beneficia a ellos. La legalidad internacional, los bloqueos y las sanciones son el único camino, o se habrá caído en su trampa y ellos se legitimarán en la infinidad de medios y parlamentos que controlan.\nEl apartheid debe acabar de una vez por todas y para siempre. Los palestinos están en su tierra y son los ocupados, tienen derecho a defenderse, Israel es la potencia ocupante y carece de ese derecho. Son los palestinos los que tienen derecho a quedarse y luchar por ello.\nNo lo digo yo, lo dicen los tratados internacionales.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Tienes toda la razón, pero no se si van a quedar palestinos, no es apartheid es genocidio y no hay presión suficiente para pararlo. Ya hay más de 20,000 muertos palestinos, no sabemos cuántos mutilados, cuantos traumatizados de por vida y que viabilidad le queda a Palestina con un mundo que deja que Israel los destruya sin poner límite.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Y que haces con esa gente que lleva 2000-3000 anios en Israel? Recuerda que hay judios que nunca se fueron.\nTambien... hay gente que lleva ahi desde que sus abuelos se defendierion de la invasion de los paises arabes en el 48. Los mandas a otro sitio? Recordemos que quien inicio esto no fueron los israelies, si no los paises musulmanes de alrededor por el precepto de \"tierra que fue musulmana hay que reconquistarla.\"\nLos acuerdos internacionales son de dos estados, y los paises arabes de alrededor nunca lo han aceptado. Tampoco la parte fachas de los sionistas, es verdad.\n[#30](c30#c-30) No hay necesidad de mandar a nadie a ningún lado (excepto a los colonos, claro), basta con que vivan en esas tierras pero bajo una autoridad que no sea la de un estado genocida y sin un derecho supremacista.\n[#31](c31#c-31) Ostias, pues eso es imposible. Si pones a los musulmanes a cargo, de facto todo el cuerpo legal de todos los paises musulames esta basado en la sharia (notese las minusculas) que es supremacista y genocida por definicion, ya que establece el principio de que solo los musulmanes son ciudadanos de pleno derecho y que hay cosas como la apostasia, que son penadas con la muerte.\n[#34](c34#c-34) Depende, si se constituye como república islámica sí, pero el hecho de que sea un país musulmán o de mayoría musulmana no implica que vayan a aplicar la sharia. Hay muchos países de mayoría musulmana que no la aplican a nivel estatal, aunque sí se aplica parcialmente a nivel privado/familiar:\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar%C3%ADa\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar%C3%ADa#/media/Archivo:Use_of_Sharia_by_country.svg\nY por ejemplo tienes Egipto, que es una República Árabe de mayoría musulmana (~94%) del islamismo suní, y que ha tenido un período islámico (el periodo de los Hermanos Musulmanes), pero luego se les acabó persiguiendo a los extremistas islamistas. Pero hasta los Hermanos Musulmanes se supone que tenían tolerancia por otras religiones:\n\"Creo que los cristianos coptos tienen derechos inherentes. Creo que son parte e integrantes de la estructura de la sociedad egipcia, y lo han sido durante más de 1400 años. Ellos son, sin duda, tan egipcios como yo lo soy, y tienen tanto derecho a esta patria como el que yo tengo...\"\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Morsi#Presidencia\nTodo depende de cómo se plantee, pero dados los países del entorno como Egipto o incluso Jordania (aunque estos sí meten la sharia por ahí, hacen mezcla) podría haber un país musulmán relativamente moderado, además de que cada país tiene su contexto y su coyuntura, en esas tierras han vivido las tres religiones abrahámicas durante miles de años, que se han pegado piñazos sí, pero no es lo mismo que un país donde solo ha habido musulmanes durante cientos de años.\nYo evidentemente pondría un estado totalmente ateo, pero soñar es gratis. Lo ideal sería un estado laico, pero en esas tierras unos y otros siguen con mentalidad un poco trasnochada. Pero es a lo que habría que aspirar, estado laico y que cada uno rece a Alá, Yahvé, el Oso Yogi o a Yoda, pero sin fliparse.\n[#36](c36#c-36) Los coptos estan relegados a ser los basureros que reciclan la mierda. Estas hablando de paises con unos mecanismos discriminatorios bestiales comparados con occidente.\nPor cierto, el mapa que has mandado, ya da miedo en si solo.\n[#38](c38#c-38) En casi cualquier país con escasa tradición democrática te encuentras unos mecanismos discriminatorios bestiales, de Occidente a veces uno habla como si fuésemos de otro planeta, pero hasta hace relativamente poco en muchos países hoy punteros había una gran discriminación hacia diversos grupos étnicos y religiosos, y en algunos sitios de hecho se sigue dando. Pero al final a fuerza de muchas protestas, participación de todo el mundo en la política sin excepciones (lo que implica tener que \"vender\" el voto a \"esos también\"), etc, se ha ido regulando. Y aun así hay bandazos a niveles legales cuando ciertos grupos políticos más extremistas llegan al poder. Aunque no lleguen al nivel de otros países más orientales, pero son los ramalazos de lo que hemos sido a lo largo de la historia las sociedades humanas.\nLa paz y la \"tolerancia\" son un fenómeno completamente reciente (que no nuevo, ojo, pero las civilizaciones pacíficas a lo largo de la historia acababan aplastadas por las belicosas), y ni siquiera es del todo permanente en los lugares más \"civilizados\", más bien intermitente, con avances y retrocesos dependiendo del momento.\n[#4](c4#c-4) \"La legalidad internacional, los bloqueos y las sanciones son el único camino\"\nSe apela a la CPI y por la influencia de EEUU se la pela.\nSe denuncia y se pide ayuda en la ONU y EEUU lo veta pese a los funcionarios muertos de la propia ONU.\n4 gatos hutíes hacen un bloqueo marítimo y EEUU militariza la zona para impedirlo.\nIsrael está masacrando abiertamente a miles de niños, mujeres y ancianos, y EEUU pone su mayor portaviones y su ejército en la zona para proteger y garantizar que nadie pare el genocidio.\nIgual ya va siendo hora de poner el bloqueo, embargos y sanciones a EEUU y dejarse de hipocresía.\n[#19](c19#c-19) El terrorismo Uyghur ha generado miles de muertos en atentados con bombas en China.\nEstoy en contra de los campos de reeducación para cualquiera que tenga relación cercana o remota con un terrorista Uygjur, pueblo que mayoritariamente vive en paz disfrutando de sus particularidades etnicas en libertad dentro de la propia China en la region de Xinjiang que es parte de China desde la dinastia Han. También estoy en contra la dispersion de presos en Espana y la ley antiterrorista utilizada casi para cualquier mierda, y también contra la detención sin garantias de espaldas mojadas en EE.UU. y la segregación en EEUU de ninos y sus familias.\nLee un poquito y deja de decir tanta chorrada por dios. Que no sabes nada.\n[#37](c37#c-37) El tibet?\ncuándo ocurrió lo del tibet? en qué contexto? En los últimos 50 anos?. En el contexto de la paz o el de una guerra civil dentro de un estado dictatorial gobernado con mano de hierro por el Kuomintang? Quién ocupo Tibet en primer término? Sabemos algo? o sólo has venido a repetir mantritas.\nlectura? para qué? saber uno de lo que habla? para qué?\nah si para justificar miles de ninos hombres y mujeres inocente espanzurrados en nombre del derecho de criminales racistas adoctrinados (no judios no israelies, sino CRIMINALES, a robar la casa de otro y a destrozar su vida por una paja mental.\nnegativo a la ignoracia hijo mío, A LA IGNORANCIA. ahí va el tuyo.\nChina no tiene un conflicto desde el conflicto de apenas dias con Vietnam por tierras fronterizas. Y de eso hace ya más de 50 anos! Aprende a leer cojona!\n[#41](c41#c-41) tú ya estás atragantado, comiendote doblada la propaganda para bobos e ignorantes, apenas te pasa ya por la garganta ni con abundante agua. Es que por no saber no sabes ni desarrollarla. Simplemente repetición papagaya es lo tuyo.\nQué pena das hijo.\n[#45](c45#c-45) que tu sepas? no sabes ni lo que has dicho ni sobre qué hablabas ni dónde te metías. Solo venías al y china qué que es lo mismo que ha hecho cognitiva. Todo en el contexto de un genocidio televisado. Tomas a todo el mundo por idiota? a ver si va a ser al revés.\nA cuidar esa comprension lectora. Para el 2024 más lectura.\nte vendrá muy bien y amueblarás mejor la mollera. Eso es cuidarse.\n[#47](c47#c-47) humildad es algo digno de pedir a quien viene aqui a hablar de lo que desconoce y como un meticón a criticar a otros sobre asuntos que le quedan muy grandes y sobre los que ignora todo. Es decir a ti.\nTienes que informarte primero, leer comprensivamente las cosas y luego opinar o criticar, no creo que sea yo el primero que te lo dice.\nEstas fiestas, como te he dicho, de felices no tienen nada.\n[#24](c24#c-24) \"pueblo que mayoritariamente vive en paz disfrutando de sus particularidades etnicas en libertad dentro de la propia China\"\nDesconozco tus motivos para blanquear una dictadura en la que los derechos humanos y la libertad de expresión brillan por su ausencia, pero en cualquier caso me parecen completamente innecesarios para denunciar las atrocidades cometidas por EEUU o Israel.\nhttps://www.amnesty.org/es/latest/news/2022/09/china-long-delayed-un-report-must-spur-accountability-for-crimes-against-humanity-in-xinjiang/\nPues a mi me parece interesantisimo, y muy acertado, que les llamen \"entidad sionista\" y en ningún momento se refieran a ellos como Israel. Me parece que incluso estos. con todo y como son, ya también han aprendido bastante de como ganar la batalla mediática. Al gobierno sionista de Israel, y a USA les va a costar grandemente haberse quitado las caretas por completo durante esta masacre. No han dejado ni la menor duda que aunque haya más de un malo en esta película, ellos son los peores.\n[#23](c23#c-23) USA además con el viejo decrépito genocida de Biden (lo llamo así no solo por su apoyo al genocidio actual, es que ese señor ha apoyado hasta la guerra de Irak en su momento, y su apoyo fue muy importante*) es especialmente ridícula, da todo el rato la sensación de que el presidente representa a la perfección lo que es USA: un estado ya decrépito en un mundo que empieza a dejar de ser el suyo, manteniendo la mentalidad y las formas del siglo pasado.\n*Presidente del Comité de Relaciones Exteriores del Senado, tras los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001, apoyó las políticas del presidente George W. Bush,54 reclamando tropas terrestres adicionales para Afganistán. Aunque se opuso inicialmente a una acción unilateral, no sin antes agotar todas las vías diplomáticas, en octubre de 2002 votó a favor de la resolución que autorizaba al Gobierno a utilizar la fuerza contra Irak.2 Su apoyo fue crucial desde su condición de presidente del Comité de Relaciones Exteriores.\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden#Pol%C3%ADtica_internacional\n[#28](c28#c-28) Franco asesinó un montón de gente por considerarlos inferiores. Israel está asesinando a un montón de gente por considerarlos inferiores. Ambos son una mierda bastante parecida, con una diferencia: uno es del siglo pasado, el otro está cometiendo un genocidio a día de hoy.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Vaya tontería con el temita de China, que la sigues nombrando como si fuera el coco pero a dia de hoy China ha causado varios ordenes de magnitud menos muertos que EEUU y ciertamente también ha violado los derechos humanos menos que los uesei, incluso incluyendo en la historia reciente los momentos más salvajes de los gobiernos anteriores chinos. El problema de gente como tú es que se creen que EEUU es mejor que China en esos aspectos sólo porque desde tu posición muy cómoda nunca has sido objetivo de sus guerras, violaciones de derechos humanos, intervenciones y demás daños al mundo que han causado.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Rebate sus argumentos si es que puedes anda y deja de decir imbecilidades y de hacer el ridículo. En China los ciudadanos también votan y eligen a sus representantes dentro de un mismo partido, que no es tan diferente a un sistema con dos partidos financiados por los mismos grupos de poder, como en los EEUU.\n[#71](c71#c-71) hay gente que no es ilustrable, pero merece la pena que si algún joven pasa por aquí preguntándose si hay alguna diferencia entre China y España, que entienda que sí, de forma objetiva, y neutral como es la Wikipedia.\n[#73](c73#c-73) si pasa algún joven por aquí preguntándose si la wikipedia es una forma objetiva y neutral de informarse\nhttps://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2019/06/05/5cf6a2a5fdddff7a768b45d2.html\n\" Lo que ocurrió el 7 de octubre se debe a las masacres cometidas contra el pueblo palestino antes de esa fecha. \"\nIrán justificando (y posiblemente más que eso) el despreciable y brutal ataque terrorista sobre civiles del 7 de octubre por Hamás.\nEstán los fundamentalistas de Irán para dar lecciones de nada.\nme recuerda a un viejo Skets de Faemino y Cansado, creo, \" tú quien quieres que te salve SuperZron o PlasticsMan o algo así. ¡ Pobres palestinos!\n[#6](c6#c-6) Tu afirmación parte de una falacia enorme. Los derechos humanos YA no valen nada. La única vía para implementarlos y estandarizarlos es que todo el mundo funcione bajo las mismas reglas, sin excepciones. Si no esos \"derechos\" son papel mojado.\nQue no hay que irse a China ni hostias, ¿los derechos humanos de Julian Assange dónde están?\n[#6](c6#c-6) cuanto valen los derechos humanos de un palestino masacrado entre cascotes?\nY la de 20.000 de ellos?\n[#10](c10#c-10) si a alguien le importara la vida de los palestinos más que su muerte como mártires contra Israel, preferiría verlos vivos y refugiados antes que masacrados entre cascotes.\nSólo Israel prefiere eso.\n[#6](c6#c-6) a quién dices que está mascarando china? Y en cuantas guerras ha participado China en el último medio siglo? Cuantos países ha invadido? Tienes siquiera pajolera idea de qué hablas? o solo repites mantras?\nEE.UU se cepilló 2 millones de iraquies, en base a una mentira además.\nIsrael ha matado en un par de meses más civiles que nadie en el ultimo medio siglo, en base a una paja mental equiparable al nazismo ya y mientras invade agrede y oprime desde hace más de medio siglo también.\nTu tara en cognición no es nueva, es el sesgo de toda la puta vida de quien picotea la propaganda que le sirve su patrón.\nLo que está claro es que este \"orden\" que vendes implica racismo a raudales, caos, crimen e injusticia en proporciones inaceptables y debe cambiar, Espana no puede ser cómplice de más mentiras y masacres derivadas y menos de los sionazis..",
