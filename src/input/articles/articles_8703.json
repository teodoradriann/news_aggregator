    "text": "CNN — Brutally cold conditions in Kansas City did not stop the Chiefs as they defeated the Miami Dolphins 26-7 at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday. The temperature at kickoff was -4 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -20 degrees, making it the fourth coldest game in National Football League history, according to the Peacock broadcast. The Kansas City offense hit the ground running, marching down the field on the opening drive and capping it off with an 11-yard touchdown throw from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Rashee Rice. Rice would go on to finish the game with eight receptions for 130 yards. The Chiefs never looked back, shutting down the Dolphins offense completely. Chiefs’ kicker Harrison Butker went 4 for 4 on field goals and running back Isiah Pacheco ran it in for a three-yard rushing touchdown to put the game on ice (literally) in the fourth quarter. Mahomes finished the game with 262 yards and a touchdown. Taylor Swift was in attendance and braved the frigid temperatures wearing a #87 Kelce jacket in support of her beau Travis Kelce. Kelce finished the game with seven receptions for 71 yards. At the end of the game, the temperature was -9 degrees and felt like -28 degrees, according to the broadcast. Mahomes downplayed the cold weather, saying “It is what it is” when asked about it on the Peacock broadcast after the game. “We’re in Kansas City, at Arrowhead,” Mahomes said. “We are going to play in some games like this. So, our mentality was to come out here, play football and see what happens.” Still, Saturday’s conditions are rivaled by the coldest NFL game on record: the December 1967 “Ice Bowl” in Wisconsin, when the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys amid -13 air temperature and a -48 wind chill, according to the NFL. Earlier on Saturday, the Houston Texans defeated the Cleveland Browns 45-14. It was a historic day for rookie Texans quarterback CJ Stroud, who threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns. Stroud’s three touchdown passes tied a rookie record in a playoff game. The 23-year-old former second-overall pick also became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in NFL history. The NFL playoffs continue on Sunday with the Green Bay Packers heading to Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. Matthew Stafford will also make his grand return to the city where he started his NFL career when the Los Angeles Rams take on the Detroit Lions. On Monday, the Pittsburgh Steelers head to a snowy Orchard Park, New York, to take on the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Philadelphia Eagles.",

    "text": "Economía Bancolombia hace anuncio importante en este fin de año, beneficiará a muchos La entidad bancaria ampliará su cobertura para el año 2024. [Por: Redacción El País](/autor/redaccion-el-pais/) Siendo uno de los bancos con más clientes en el país, [Bancolombia tiene una gran demanda de servicios financieros y transacciones requeridas diariamente por los ciudadanos.](https://www.elpais.com.co/colombia/ya-se-pueden-usar-los-servicios-virtuales-de-bancolombia-esto-dijo-la-entidad-financiera-tras-la-caida-de-este-fin-de-semana-1354.html) Por esta razón, en ocasiones no se presta el servicio oportunamente, ya que la infraestructura para la atención puede verse reducida ante demasiadas solicitudes de servicios. Para responder a esta necesidad y brindar mayor atención a sus usuarios, Bancolombia confirmó que, desde este fin de año, estará en funcionamiento su corresponsal bancario número 29.000 en todo el territorio nacional, una ampliación en cobertura que llegará al 97% del país, ofreciendo más facilidades de acceso a la población en el 2024. Así funcionan los corresponsales bancarios El banco informó que se hacía necesaria esta ampliación, [puesto que mediante estos canales se movilizan más del 80% de los flujos monetarios de entidades financieras en Colombia. ](https://www.elpais.com.co/economia/bancolombia-hizo-importante-advertencia-a-sus-clientes-que-no-le-roben-su-dinero-1435.html)Es decir, se realizan un promedio de 2.300 transacciones mensuales desde cada corresponsal bancario. Bancolombia explicó que estos corresponsales son “un modelo de atención que funciona en tiendas de abarrotes, farmacias, ferreterías, supermercados y otros comercios en ciudades, barrios y veredas que han encontrado en él una manera de producir ingresos adicionales, al tiempo que entregan a sus vecinos los beneficios de pertenecer al sector financiero formal”. Debido a esta medida más cercana a la gente, según informó el banco, están reduciendo el número de poblaciones con cobertura vulnerable. Pronto, aseguró Bancolombia, estarán operando en el 100 % de los municipios del país. La entidad aclaró que hay una variedad de formas que están desarrollando, “por ejemplo, existen también corresponsales móviles y digitales que le permiten a Bancolombia estar donde las personas lo necesitan con servicios como transferencias, pagos y retiros a través de personas naturales. Hoy, hay cerca de 500 corresponsables bancarios que hacen 2 millones de transacciones y movilizan más de 500.000 millones de pesos”. Medidas para transferir por Nequi en fin de año En vísperas de Año Nuevo las transacciones bancarias suelen tener un pico importante, [especialmente porque las familias envían dinero a sus seres queridos y se incrementan las compras de los hogares.](https://www.elpais.com.co/economia/cuanto-es-lo-maximo-que-puedo-transferir-de-bancolombia-a-nequi-2417.html) Pensando en ello, Bancolombia y Nequi enviaron en las últimas horas a sus usuarios, una notificación en la que se informa que las transacciones realizadas después del 28 de diciembre a las 4:00 p.m. solo llegarían hasta el 2 de enero de 2024. Vale la pena aclarar que el mensaje se refería solo a las transacciones que se hagan a otros bancos, los cuales son: Mundo mujer, Unión, BBVA, Bancamía, Av villas, Agrario, BTG pactual, Caja social, Cooperativo coopcentral, Credifinanciera, Davivienda, Falabella, Pichincha, Popular, Santander, Serfinanza, W.S.A, Bogotá, Occidente, Bancoldex, Bancomeva, Citibank, Coink, Coltefinanciera,Daviplata, Iris, Itapu, Lulo, Movii, Pibank, Rappipay, Santander, Scotiabank. Las que si no tendrán inconvenientes son las personas que hagan transferencias de Nequi a Nequi o de Nequi a Bancolombia, pues ellas sí recibirán el dinero de manera inmediata.",

    "title": "Francisco Lindor MVP caliber season",
    "text": "MVP? Who knows. But Lindor's supreme value to the Mets is unquestioned There is no player in the National League, not even Shohei Ohtani, more valuable to his team than [Francisco Lindor](https://www.mlb.com/player/596019) has been to the Mets this season. It’s there for Mets fans, every single day. No one appreciates Lindor’s talent, passion and flair more than the Mets fan known as Carlos Mendoza, who also happens to be Lindor’s manager. I asked Mendoza on Wednesday afternoon, before the Mets made it seven wins in a row by [sweeping their series against the Red Sox](https://www.mlb.com/news/jesse-winker-hits-grand-slam-in-mets-7th-straight-win), if he could imagine anybody else doing more for his team than Lindor has been doing for the 2024 Mets. “No chance,” Mendoza said. He was just getting going. “I know there are a lot of great players doing a lot of great things for their teams this season,” Mendoza continued. “But what this man has done for this franchise is off the charts, and that means both on and off the field. When a special player is also a special person, in terms of his commitment and dedication, that is a pretty awesome combination. “What is this, his fourth season in New York? It’s so clear that this is home now. New York is home, and all he has to do is concentrate on being the best version of himself -- at the plate, and playing an elite shortstop for the New York Mets -- and being the leader of this team. That’s something I’ve never asked him to do, by the way. It just comes naturally to him, that kind of presence. And his teammates feed off it, I can tell you that.” Mendoza is a rookie manager who has acted like anything but that. He has calmly and effectively been a leader himself as the Mets have gone from 22-33 on May 29 to 76-64 after beating the Red Sox again on Wednesday. And by the way: He says the same thing about Lindor, who has played in every game this season, that Lindor’s previous manager, Buck Showalter, always said. “This guy posts,” Mendoza said. “Knock on wood, we can count on him every single day.” Then Mendoza added: “Every so often, I gently raise the subject of giving him a game off. I did it the other day. And he pointed at the calendar and said, 'Sept. 5. That’s my day off.'\" It is, of course, an off-day for all the Mets, with no game for them until Friday against the Reds at Citi Field. Lindor started off so slowly this season, but he has soared since Mendoza moved him into the leadoff spot in his batting order. Since May 21, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, Lindor is first in the league in batting (.314), second in on-base percentage (.380), second in slugging (.575), first in OPS (.955), first in hits (121), first in extra-base hits (54), tied for second with 23 home runs and third in runs scored with 70. Here are some of Ohtani’s numbers over this same period, according to the Elias Sports Bureau (they know everything): Batting average of .259, on-base percentage of .351. He’s slugging .594, and his OPS since the end of May is .946. And you know that doesn’t tell Ohtani’s whole story. He remains a wonder of the universe, even in a year when he’s not pitching, hitting home runs and stealing bases the way he does, [perhaps on his way to being the first-ever member of the 50/50 Club](https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-shohei-ohtani-home-run-stolen-base-tracker). But Lindor, still just 30, is now a shortstop who has hit 30 or more home runs in five different seasons. Only Alex Rodriguez, with seven, did that more times. “I remember going to his place and sitting with him for two hours after I got the job,” Mendoza said. “And when we were done, my first reaction was, ‘Wow, this guy is exactly who I heard he was.' “He was already one of the best players in our game, and all he talked about was wanting to get better. Listen, you could see it sitting in another dugout. But I like it much better sitting in ours, watching him hit -- and hit for power -- from both sides of the plate and get on base. He’s the complete package, and that’s before you see how he brings the whole group together.” Some of this can be measured in metrics, but some simply cannot. Just know this: At a time in the year when the Mets are playing their best ball, Lindor is playing his best ball. There is no attempt here, none, to diminish what Ohtani is doing in his first season with the Dodgers, at the plate and on the bases. But he is a DH in the end, and Lindor is an every-single-day shortstop on a team that has been 23 games over .500 since bottoming out against Ohtani’s team on May 29. Bottom line? Lindor is the switch-hitting every-single-day guy who is the most complete player the New York Mets have ever had. “This is New York,” Mendoza said. “It gets real loud here. But game after game, he just quietly goes about his business.” While the “MVP” chants he hears every time he steps to the plate at Citi Field keep getting louder. With good reason.",

    "text": "Environment\nFinal Season of 'La Brea' is Lasting Model for Sustainable Production\nThe third and final season of La Brea continued the show’s strong track record implementing behind-the-scenes sustainable practices, earning an Environmental Media Association Gold Seal.\nLa Brea is a production of Universal Television and Matchbox Pictures, an Australian production company that is helping lead the way in sustainable production practices as a founding member of Sustainable Screens Australia and a driver of eco-conscious practices at all stages of production.\nSeason 3 of La Brea, shot in Australia, built upon the sustainability efforts and technologies from Season 2. For example, Season 2 utilized a hybrid battery system – the first of its kind in Australia – to power the production unit base and significantly reduce diesel fuel usage. Production went one step further by supplementing power to the hybrid battery system with solar panels, further reducing fuel and associated greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe show achieved additional fuel savings by utilizing double trailers instead of single room trailers. Eighty-five percent of set lighting included energy-efficient LEDs. La Brea matched one hundred percent of production electricity use with solar power by purchasing Australian renewable energy certificates.\nIn addition to reusing green technologies from previous seasons, Season 3 reused sets, props, and costumes, and upon wrap donated eighty percent of stock costumes to local charities like Dress for Success, Clothesline, Defenders for Hope, and Tread Lightly.\nThe show also diverted waste from landfills through recycling and composting programs in the office, on stage, and on location, as well as reducing single-use plastics.\nSustainable practices weren’t just incorporated behind-the-scenes. On screen, viewers can spot hybrid and electric vehicles in episodes three and four.\nLa Brea may be coming to an end in Season 3, but the show’s commitment to sustainable practices will serve as a model for other TV and film productions.\n“La Brea has been really rewarding in so many ways including making this production more sustainable,” said Jerry DiCanio, EVP Production Operations, Universal Television. “We’ve learned a lot about new technologies, including battery generators, alternative sources of power, and emission reduction on this show. It’s gratifying to be able to apply these advancements for future productions.”",

    "title": "‘Blasphemous’ same-sex nativity scene angers conservatives in Italy",
    "text": "A church nativity scene which features two mothers of the Baby Jesus, instead of the conventional Mary and Joseph figurines, has sparked anger among conservative Catholics and politicians in Italy. Nativity scenes are popular in the largely Catholic country, but in recent years they have been increasingly mired in culture wars as its society becomes more secular and multi-cultural. The priest at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, in Capocastello di Mercogliano, a hamlet in the province of Avellino about one hour’s drive east of Naples, has defended its depiction of the birth of Jesus. “I wanted to show with this scene that families are no longer just the traditional ones,” Father Vitaliano Della Sala told Reuters. “In our parishes we see more and more children from the new types of families that exist and are part of our society, children of separated and divorced people, gay couples, single people, young mothers.” Father Della Sala, known in Italy for sympathizing with LGBT and left-wing causes, says his attitude is in line with that of Pope Francis, who this week, in a landmark ruling, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples. But Senator Maurizio Gasparri, of the co-ruling Forza Italia party, said the LGBT creche “offends all those who always had respect and devotion for the Holy Family”. The Pro-Vita & Famiglia (Pro-Life and Family) group called it “dangerous, as well as shameful and blasphemous”. Pro-Vita, which launched an online petition calling on the bishop of Avellino to intervene, said the nativity scene contradicted the Church’s teachings on the family and legitimized same-sex parenting and surrogacy. The petition has so far attracted more than 21,000 signatories. Having children through surrogacy is illegal in Italy, and parliament is discussing a government-sponsored law that would also criminalize couples who resort to the practice by going abroad. This week, a senator from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party proposed another bill that would prevent school directors from halting Catholic-themed activities such as Christmas plays or the making of nativity scenes.",
