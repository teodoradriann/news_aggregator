    "title": "Judge orders removal of wind farm opposed by Osage",
    "text": "Curtis Killman\nTulsa World\nA judge has ordered the removal of a wind farm in Osage County and set a trial for damages in a win for the Osage Nation and its Mineral Council, which, along with the federal government, have been fighting the erection of the turbines for more than 10 years.\nU.S. Court of International Trade Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves, sitting by designation, issued the ruling Wednesday in Tulsa federal court against Osage Wind LLC, Enel Kansas LLC and Enel Green Power North America Inc.\nThe ruling grants the United States and the Osage Nation through its Minerals Council permanent injunctive relief via “ejectment of the wind turbine farm for continuing trespass.”\nThe Minerals Council is an arm of the Osage Nation that manages the Osage Minerals Estate.\nThe ruling follows a 2017 appellate court ruling that determined that construction of the wind farm constituted mining and required a lease from the Osage Nation’s Minerals Council, which the defendants failed to obtain.\n“The developers failed to acquire a mining lease during or after construction, as well as after issuance of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision holding that a mining lease was required,” Choe-Groves said.\n“On the record before the Court, it is clear the Defendants are actively avoiding the leasing requirement,” Choe-Groves said. “Permitting such behavior would create the prospect for future interference with the Osage Mineral Council’s authority by Defendants or others wishing to develop the mineral lease.\n“The Court concludes that Defendants’ past and continued refusal to obtain a lease constitutes interference with the sovereignty of the Osage Nation and is sufficient to constitute irreparable injury.”\nOsage Minerals Council Chairman Everett Waller said in an interview Thursday morning that he was still “stunned” by the ruling.\n“I hope no other tribe has to do what we had to do,” Waller said, referring to the long court battle.\n“This is a win not only for the Osage Minerals Council; this is a win for Indian Country,” Waller said.\n“There are a lot of smaller tribes that couldn’t have battled this long, but that’s why we’re Osages,” Waller said. “We’re here, and this is our homeland, and we are going to protect it at all costs.”\nOsage Wind, for its part, claimed that while an appeals court found that it had “mined without a lease in 2014, it did not hold that Osage Wind was obligated to obtain a lease for that completed mining or for any other ongoing purposes.”\nThe legal saga has been ongoing for more than a decade, at one point reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Osage Nation filed a federal lawsuit in October 2011 seeking to halt the construction of the wind farm, alleging that the project unlawfully deprived the Osage Nation of access to and the right to develop the mineral estate.\nThe nation’s claims were denied, and the case was dismissed on merits.\nThe defendants began leasing surface rights for the project in 2013, according to the ruling.\nThe wind farm includes 84 turbines spread across 8,400 acres of leased surface rights in Osage County, underground lines, overhead transmission lines, meteorological towers and access roads, the ruling said.\nConstruction on the wind towers began in October 2013, with excavation for the towers beginning in September 2014.\nThe federal government filed a federal lawsuit in November 2014, seeking a declaratory judgment that the defendants engaged in unauthorized mining and excavation in the Osage Mineral Estate, according to the ruling.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior administers the Osage Nation’s mineral rights, which include ownership of rocks and minerals below the ground’s surface. Federal law requires developers to obtain a permit from the tribe’s Minerals Council to engage in any mining activity in the county.\nA federal district judge initially ruled in favor of the wind farm project in 2015, finding that excavation of the rock for the wind turbine concrete foundation did not constitute mining.\nBut the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed that decision in a 2017 ruling.\nThe appellate court held that Osage Wind’s extraction, sorting, crushing and use of minerals as part of its excavation work constituted mineral development, thereby requiring a federally approved lease that was not obtained. It disputed the district judge’s interpretation that the definition of mining required the sale of minerals.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request by Osage Wind to review the appeals court decision.\nIn considering whether to issue a permanent injunction, Choe-Groves weighed several factors, including balancing the tribe’s claim that the unleased wind farm damages its sovereignty against Osage Wind’s claim that it would suffer the inevitable loss of hundreds of millions of dollars if the wind towers were removed.\nOsage Wind also claimed that removal of the wind turbines would result in a loss of revenue from two local schools, jobs, income for the surface estate owners and renewable energy for 50,000 homes.\nBut Choe-Groves was not persuaded by Osage Wind’s claims of the harm that would occur if the turbines were removed.\n“Even if negative effects were to result, including the significant monetary impact of hundreds of millions of dollars, such effects would not negate the public interest in private entities abiding by the law and respecting government sovereignty and the decision of courts,” the judge wrote.\nA spokesman for Osage Wind could not be reached for comment on the decision.",

    "text": "Parents, students, and teachers across St. Albert are coming to grips this week with a security breach of the web service they use to track grades and make payments.\nThe\nSt. Albert Public, Greater St. Albert Catholic, Sturgeon Public, and Conseil scolaire Centre-Nord school boards sent notices to parents Jan. 8-9 about a data breach of PowerSchool — an online service used by schools across North America to process fees and distribute information about grades and attendance.\nIn a letter sent to GSACRD, PowerSchool CEO Hardeep Gulati said that PowerSchool learned of a potential security breach on Dec. 28, 2024, related to its PowerSource customer support website. Investigators later confirmed that someone had used compromised credentials to access data contained in the PowerSchool Student Information System. The company has since informed law enforcement, deactivated the compromised credentials, restricted access to PowerSource, and reset all PowerSource passwords.\n“The incident is contained and we have no evidence of malware [or] continued unauthorized activity in the PowerSchool environment,” the letter reads.\nIn an online post, St. Albert Public said it was one of hundreds of school divisions across North America affected by the breach and had not been specifically targeted.\n“We understand that news like this can be unsettling, and we want to assure you that we are doing everything possible to address the situation responsibly and proactively.”\nGSACRD officials said the PowerSchool service itself was still operational, and that in its particular case no financial information had been stored or accessed in it.\nIn an email, Centre-Nord spokesperson Laura Devaney said PowerSchool did not expect this breach to lead to any misuse of personal information or financial harm. The company has promied to provide credit monitoring and identity protection services to anyone affected by the breach.\nThe Gazette will update this story as more information becomes available.",

    "text": "Hija de un hombre que murió por la ola de calor en peregrinación: “Estamos contentos de que esté enterrado en La Meca”\nMelissa Velásquez Loaiza\n(CNN) — La familia de un anciano indonesio fallecido durante el Hajj de este año se alegra de que fuera enterrado en la ciudad santa de La Meca, según declaró su hija, mientras la nación del sudeste asiático llora a cientos de sus ciudadanos que perecieron bajo un calor extremo durante la peregrinación islámica anual.\nMás de 1.300 personas murieron en el Hach de este año, con “numerosos casos” debidos al estrés térmico, según las autoridades saudíes, después de que más de 1,8 millones de peregrinos participaran a pesar de que las temperaturas se dispararon hasta niveles peligrosos. Las autoridades de Indonesia, el país de mayoría musulmana más poblado del mundo, dijeron que al menos 215 indonesios se encuentran entre los fallecidos.\nEn declaraciones a CNN este domingo, Heru Jumartiyah dijo que su padre de 86 años, Ngatijo Wongso Sentono, murió el 17 de junio en su tienda de campaña en Mina, al sureste de La Meca, mientras esperaba las oraciones del mediodía.\n“Estaba dormido y antes no tenía síntomas de enfermedad. Todo el mundo decía que estaba sano durante la procesión del Hach”, declaró.\nSentono se había inscrito para la peregrinación en 2018 y viajó a La Meca con su esposa de 83 años y vecinos de la ciudad indonesia de Yogyakarta, dijo Jumartiyah.\n“Mi padre estaba muy entusiasmado con la idea de ir al Hach. Quería irse inmediatamente”, dijo.\nDecenas de peregrinos del Hajj mueren mientras las temperaturas en La Meca alcanzan los 49 ºC\nPeregrinaje mortal en La Meca debido al calor extremo 2:04\nRealizar el peregrinaje a La Meca es uno de los cinco pilares del Islam, que exige a todo musulmán que esté en condiciones físicas y económicas de realizar el viaje a la ciudad santa de La Meca al menos una vez en su vida.\nSegún la creencia islámica, morir y ser enterrado en La Meca se considera una bendición, y muchos musulmanes viajan en su vejez tras haber ahorrado durante muchos años para realizar la peregrinación.\n“Nos alegramos de que fuera enterrado en La Meca”, declaró Jumartiyah, y añadió que esperaba visitar la tumba de su padre cuando finalmente hiciera la peregrinación.\nJumartiyah dijo que su madre, Pariyem Prawirodinomo, está sana y que regresará a Indonesia el 7 de julio.\nUnos 241.000 peregrinos indonesios tenían previsto realizar el viaje a La Meca este año, según las autoridades indonesias, la mayor cuota de la historia del país.\nSegún datos del Ministerio indonesio de Asuntos Religiosos, la mayoría de los indonesios que murieron en la peregrinación de este año eran mayores de 50 años.\nNo es raro que Indonesia registre cientos de muertes durante el Hajj de cada año: el año pasado, 773 personas murieron durante la peregrinación, según los registros del ministerio.\n“Ahorraron toda su vida para esto”: la angustia de una estadounidense cuyos padres murieron durante la peregrinación a La Meca\n“He visto morir a muchos peregrinos”\nEl calor extremo se ha señalado como uno de los principales factores de los cientos de muertos y heridos registrados este año durante el peregrinaje. La Meca, la ciudad santa central para los peregrinos del Hach, registró este lunes temperaturas récord de 51 grados centígrados.\nDiversas autoridades han señalado también que los problemas se han agravado por el número de peregrinaciones no oficiales, y el gobierno saudí dijo este domingo que los viajes “no autorizados” eran responsables de más de cuatro de cada cinco de las víctimas mortales.\nArabia Saudí exige que cada peregrino adquiera una de las 1,8 millones de licencias disponibles para acceder legalmente a La Meca. Estas licencias pueden costar varios miles de dólares estadounidenses. Los peregrinos sin licencia no suelen viajar en autobuses turísticos organizados con aire acondicionado o fácil acceso a suministros de agua y alimentos.\nComo parte de la peregrinación, los fieles realizan una serie de rituales en la ciudad santa de La Meca y sus alrededores, que a menudo implican muchas horas de caminata diaria bajo un calor abrasador.\nAlgunos peregrinos han lamentado la deficiente infraestructura y organización del Hajj de este año. Incluso los peregrinos de los viajes oficiales pasan la mayor parte del día caminando al aire libre bajo el calor.\nSeis peregrinos del Hajj mueren por insolación en La Meca tras advertencia de temperaturas cercanas a los 48 grados Celsius\nVideo relacionado: Fotografía inédita de la piedra ancestral de La Meca 1:13\nAlgunos testigos han relatado a CNN cómo vieron a fieles perder el conocimiento y pasar junto a cadáveres cubiertos de telas blancas.\nUn indonesio de 44 años, que solo quiso que se le llamara Ahmad, recordó haber visto a muchos moribundos por el calor.\n“De camino a casa, vi morir a muchos peregrinos. Casi cada pocos cientos de metros, había un cuerpo tendido y cubierto con una tela ihrom (tela blanca)”.\n“Cada vez que hay una distribución de agua por parte de los residentes locales o de ciertos grupos, es inmediatamente invadida por los peregrinos”, añadió, diciendo que no vio personal sanitario ni una sola ambulancia a lo largo del camino.\nEn las últimas décadas, el gran tamaño de las multitudes del Hach ha sido un factor en varios incidentes mortales durante la peregrinación, incluida una estampida que mató a cientos de personas en 2015.\nSin embargo, los expertos advirtieron de que el aumento de las temperaturas supone la amenaza más mortífera para los peregrinos, ya que los récords de calor caen en Medio Oriente —una de las regiones más vulnerables a la crisis climática—, lo que hace más arriesgadas las concentraciones masivas.\nEl climatólogo e historiador del tiempo Maximiliano Herrera, que hace un seguimiento de las temperaturas extremas, declaró a CNN que los desiertos de la región “se calentaban por la noche mucho más rápido que durante el día”, lo que se suponía que proporcionaba un respiro y alivio del calor. “Esto no existía hasta hace un par de décadas”, dijo Herrera.\n“A todo el mundo le afecta el calor mortal y, lamentablemente, no me sorprende el número de muertos (en el Hajj)”, añadió.\n“Pasar tiempo al aire libre en el calor extremo de La Meca es arriesgarse a morir… así que me temo que habrá más peregrinaciones mortales del Hach en el futuro”.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Su trabajo y dedicación marcaron avances importantes en la investigación científica\", aseguró el jueves en su cuenta de la red social X el Ministerio de Ciencias de Colombia.\nEl inmunólogo y patólogo fue el primer creador de una vacuna sintética contra la malaria, una enfermedad tropical parasitaria que se transmite por la picadura de mosquitos infectados y que, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), en 2023 causó 597.000 muertes\n\"A pesar de las ofertas para trabajar en centros de investigación del resto del mundo, decidió establecerse en su país, Colombia, trabajando con un pequeño equipo interdisciplinar\", asegura una breve biografía de la Fundación Princesa de Asturias de España, que en 1994 le otorgó el premio Príncipe de Asturias. A lo largo de su carrera recibió otros reconocimientos por sus investigaciones y su nombre llegó a sonar como candidato al Premio Nobel de medicina.\nDesde 1984, Patarrayo fue el primer director del Instituto de Inmunología del hospital San Juan de Dios de Bogotá. Allí desarrolló entre 1986 y 1988 su vacuna SPf66 contra la malaria, la primera en ser reconocida por la OMS.\n\"Sus aportes y legado en la inmunología serán siempre recordados, así como su ingenio, entusiasmo y dedicación por la investigación y la ciencia\", aseguró en un comunicado difundido en X la facultad de medicina de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, a la que estuvo vinculado por más de 50 años.\nLa vacuna de Patarroyo contra la malaria ya no se usa por su poca efectividad, pero en su momento fue revolucionaria.\nEl científico fue blanco de críticas de animalistas y de investigaciones judiciales por el uso de micos de la Amazonía para probar la efectividad de la inyección.\n© 2025 AFP",
