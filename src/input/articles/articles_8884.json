Los tantos de Tomas Soucek a los 13 minutos y el exjugador del Arsenal Konstantinos Mavropanos, al 55′, llevó a la sorpresiva victoria de los ‘Hammers’ en el Estadio Emirates y continuó el bache de medio temporada de los ‘Gunners’. Focused 🧠 [#WHUFC]| [@SocSupplement] [pic.twitter.com/UosCuAWSMv] — West Ham United (@WestHam) [December 28, 2023] Arsenal suma sólo una victoria en cuatro duelos de liga después de que pasó Navidad en el primer lugar y ahora necesita superar el domingo al Fulham para tener la oportunidad de iniciar el 2024 otra vez en la cima. Arsenal se encuentra segundo a dos puntos del Liverpool, que volverá a jugar hasta el próximo año. El West Ham podría haber ganado por una diferencia más amplia, pero el portero del Arsenal, David Raya, detuvo el penalti de Said Benrahma en el sexto minuto del tiempo añadido. Hubo una ligera controversia en el primer gol debido a que las cámaras no captaron claramente si el balón estaba fuera de lugar debido a que la pierna de Jarrod Browns bloqueó la imagen y el árbitro decidió mantener la decisión de campo. El 4 de noviembre ocurrió una situación similar en el encuentro del Arsenal y Newcastle. La última derrota de los ‘Gunners’ en casa fue a mediados de mayo ante Brighton. Ese resultado prácticamente confirmó el título para el Manchester City. Por su parte, el mexicano [Edson Álvarez](https://www.reporteindigo.com/fan/edson-alvarez-anota-y-asiste-en-la-victoria-del-west-ham-en-la-europa-league/) jugó los 90 minutos con el West Ham, que saltó a la sexta posición superando al Manchester United. Tottenham, humillado Los ‘Spurs’ llegaron a su duelo contra el Brighton como uno de los cuatro mejores equipos de la Premier; sin embargo, tuvieron una miserable actuación y cayeron por 4-2. Los tardíos goles del argentino Alejo Véliz y Ben Davies hicieron ver más respetable el marcador para los visitantes, pero aún así fueron superados en el Estadio Amex por un equipo que no cuenta con 10 jugadores por lesiones. Jack Hinshelwood abrió el marcador a los 11 minutos y João Pedro convirtió un penalti al 23′, después de que Dejan Kulusevski derribó a Danny Welbeck en el área. A Richarlison le anularon un gol y le pegó al travesaño antes del medio tiempo por el Tottenham. El ecuatoriano Pervis Estupiñan puso el 3-0 con un disparo de 25 metros al minuto 63. João Pedro anotó su segundo tanto del acuerdo —otra vez de penalti— al minuto 75 tras una falta del argentino Giovani Lo Celso sobre Evan Ferguson.",

    "text": "Food Bank of Delaware sprouting support at its hunger relief garden in Milford MILFORD, Del. – The Food Bank of Delaware (FBD) is sprouting new opportunity in Milford in its hunger relief garden. “Really innovative work” Currently, three greenhouses, and a packing barn, stand on the newly-constructed Milford property. Funding for the project was bolstered with an $84,548 congressional award. The FBD applied for the funds through the office of U.S. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.). The facility is expected to help support distribution of nearly four million pounds of produce per year. “In Congress, we talk a lot about making sure that we’re dealing with issues of supply chains, because that affects our agriculture sector, as well,” Rep. Blunt Rochester said. “Our food bank, here in Delaware, is doing some really innovative work.” Sprouting Support Community garden manager, Caroline May, is excited to see the plants begin to grow. She says the greenhouses are the perfect place to do so. “It’s much warmer in here than it is outside,” May said. “They also provide protection against animals, because it’s enclosed. And finally, they help with water. A lot of times, plant disease happens from water hitting the leaves.” All of the produce grown in the greenhouses will directly benefit the FBD, and those it serves; 75% will help stock the food bank’s healthy pantry, and the rest will go to support other FBD programs, like culinary education and the facility’s on-site cafe. However, May says, the garden is about much more than just growing healthy food. “It shows people what farming can look like. People see really large corn and soy bean fields, and that is a really important way of farming, but our vegetable farms are never really that big,” May explained. “It’s a much smaller piece of land, and that’s a lot more attainable for beginner farmers.” Bigger Picture Rep. Blunt Rochester says she also sees the bigger picture; she says programs like the garden, play an important role in fighting food insecurity and economic instability. “Part of their mission is also growing future farmers, exposing kids and young people who maybe have never been exposed to the agriculture field,” said Rep. Blunt Rochester. “I got to meet some of the individuals who are being trained on things from culinary arts to logistics. These will create good paying jobs for individuals, and then we just get to see the rich partnerships.” Get Involved May, who is currently the only full-time manager at the garden, is hoping more Delawareans will lend a hand. She says the garden can’t be sustained without volunteers. “If you’re interested in coming to volunteer, we have shifts open on Volunteer Hub,” May said. “On an average volunteer shift, you can imagine doing a bunch of tasks, from helping us make beds, to putting plants in the ground, to eventually harvesting crops.” To find out more about volunteering at the Food Bank of Delaware, click here.",

    "text": "USDA authorizes emergency haying and grazing on conservation program acres to aid Ohio livestock producers impacted by drought\nIn response to persistent drought conditions, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) this week announced that 79 Ohio counties are authorized for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. CRP participants in all remaining Ohio counties are also authorized to donate emergency haying and grazing rights to livestock producers affected by severe drought conditions in southeast and southern Ohio.\n“We’re experiencing historically significant drought conditions in Ohio, and many livestock producers in drought-impacted counties in our state are in urgent need of access to grazing acres and hay resources to sustain their herds,” said John Patterson, State Executive Director for FSA in Ohio. “If you have CRP acres and want to help our livestock producers, please contact your local FSA office, and we’ll help you navigate available emergency and non-emergency use options.”\nProgram Flexibilities and Eligibility\nFSA, with concurrence from State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) partners, is waiving emergency haying and grazing restrictions for Ohio’s two SAFE projects: Ohio Pollinator & Monarch SAFE project and Ohio Upland Bird SAFE project. This added flexibility increases the number of acres available to livestock producers. FSA is currently evaluating opportunities to authorize emergency haying and grazing of land enrolled in CRP through the Ohio Lake Erie Watershed and Ohio Scioto River Watershed Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) agreements.\nThe following Ohio counties are currently eligible for emergency haying and grazing: Adams, Allen, Ashland, Athens, Auglaize, Belmont, Brown, Butler, Carroll, Champaign, Clark, Clermont, Clinton, Columbiana, Coshocton, Crawford, Defiance, Delaware, Erie, Fairfield, Fayette, Franklin, Fulton, Gallia, Greene, Guernsey, Hamilton, Hancock, Hardin, Harrison, Henry, Highland, Hocking, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Knox, Lawrence, Licking, Logan, Lucas, Madison, Mahoning, Marion, Meigs, Mercer, Miami, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, Morrow, Muskingum, Noble, Ottawa, Paulding, Perry, Pickaway, Pike, Portage, Preble, Putnam, Richland, Ross, Sandusky, Scioto, Seneca, Shelby, Stark, Trumbull, Tuscarawas, Union, Van Wert, Vinton, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Williams, Wood and Wyandot.\nCRP emergency haying and grazing eligibility triggers for counties when the D2 (severe drought) level is reached on the U.S. Drought Monitor for at least one week and if the county is outside of the primary nesting season, March 15 through July 15. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill authorized counties with a documented 40-percent loss of forage production to be eligible for emergency grazing and haying. There is no fee or annual rental payment reduction assessed for emergency haying and grazing.\nHow to Donate CRP Haying and Grazing Rights\nEligible CRP participants in all Ohio counties are authorized to donate emergency haying and grazing rights to livestock producers affected by severe drought conditions in southeast and southern Ohio until March 15, 2025.\nBefore the CRP acres are hayed or grazed, participants who want to donate CRP acres for the purpose of emergency grazing and haying must obtain a modified conservation plan, which includes emergency grazing requirements from either USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) or the participant's Technical Service Provider. To ensure emergency haying or grazing of CRP acres is only being utilized by livestock producers adversely impacted by the drought, the livestock producer must file a CCC-576 (Notice of Loss) or provide a written certification, to FSA, to be included in the CRP contract file.\nHaying or grazing activities are not authorized if these activities will cause long-term damage to the vegetative cover on the land as determined on a contract-by-contract basis. The CRP participant is responsible for non-compliance with the CRP contract provisions.\nDue to privacy laws, FSA cannot release the names of CRP contract holders willing to assist livestock producers in the drought-impact areas without their written consent. CRP participants must voluntarily disclose their willingness to assist livestock producers and consent to the disclosure of their personal information before FSA can release the information to livestock producers seeking assistance.\nCRP participants who are interested in donating CRP grazing and haying privileges should contact their local USDA Service Center to confirm CRP practice eligibility and obtain approval from FSA prior to grazing or haying eligible CRP acres.\nNon-Emergency Haying and Grazing of CRP Acres\nNon-emergency grazing and haying activities should comply with the CRP participant’s conservation plan during drought or natural disaster conditions, but the site conditions should be taken into consideration and the plan modified, as needed. Non-emergency harvesting for hay is authorized once during the approved event outside primary nesting season, March 15 through July 15.\nParticipants must leave 25 percent of the contract acres unharvested or hayed. Non-emergency grazing must not exceed 120 days. During the primary nesting season, there must be a 50-percent carrying capacity reduction. For both non-emergency grazing and haying, there is a 25-percent annual rental payment reduction.\nCRP participants who are interested in donating CRP grazing and haying privileges or offering or utilizing non-emergency use privileges should contact their local USDA Service Center to confirm CRP practice eligibility and obtain approval from FSA prior to grazing or haying eligible CRP acres.\nAdditional Drought Recovery Assistance\nUSDA offers a full suite of programs providing technical and financial assistance to help farmers and livestock producers recover from drought. Impacted producers should contact their local USDA Service Center to report losses and learn more about program options available to assist in their recovery from crop, land, infrastructure, and livestock losses and damages.\nAdditional USDA disaster assistance information can be found on farmers.gov, including USDA resources specifically for producers impacted by drought. Those resources include the Disaster Assistance Discovery Tool, Disaster-at-a-Glance fact sheet, Loan Assistance Tool, and Natural Disasters and Crop Insurance fact sheet. Additionally, FarmRaise offers an FSA educational hub with LIP and ELAP decision tools as well as farm loan resource videos. For FSA and NRCS programs, producers should contact their local USDA Service Center. For assistance with a crop insurance claim, producers and landowners should contact their crop insurance agent.\nPublisher's note: A free press is critical to having well-informed voters and citizens.

    "text": "Nell'era dei social e della condivisione estrema la privacy può svanire in un clic e trasformarsi da semplice gossip a reato. È quanto sarebbe accaduto a Stefano De Martino e Caroline Tronelli finiti al centro di un caso di hackeraggio e diffusione di video privati. A fare luce su quanto accaduto negli scorsi giorni alla coppia più chiacchierata dell'estate è stato Gabriele Parpiglia, che ha denunciato l'accaduto sulle pagine di AffariItaliani.\nI video privati e la denuncia\nSecondo quanto riferito dal giornalista, le telecamere a circuito chiuso dell'appartamento, dove vive Caroline Tronelli, attuale fidanzata di Stefano De Martino, sarebbero state violate dagli hacker. Le immagini e i video delle riprese registrate dalle cam di sorveglianza dislocate all'interno dell'abitazione - che avrebbero immortalato insieme il conduttore di \"Affari tuoi\" e la modella napoletana - sarebbero state rubate e pubblicate in rete. La diffusione si sarebbe allargata non solo al web ma anche a gruppi WhatsApp e Telegram e persino su un sito estero poi oscurato. La diffusione dei video privati avrebbe spinto Stefano De Martino e Caroline a sporgere denuncia.\nL'intervento della polizia Postale\nMentre le autorità indagano sull'origine e la diffusione dei file, restano ancora da chiarire le modalità dell'intrusione. Non è chiaro se si sia trattato di un'azione mirata o di un episodio casuale, né se gli autori fossero alla ricerca di contenuti a sfondo sessuale o di informazioni utili per pianificare furti. Il materiale privato sarebbe stato rimosso poco dopo la pubblicazione e la Polizia postale, attraverso indagini mirate, avrebbe già ricostruito in parte la dinamica, ipotizzando possibili procedimenti penali per violazione della privacy e altri reati.\nI gossip su De Martino e Caroline\nSulla vicenda né Stefano De Martino né Caroline Tronelli hanno rilasciato dichiarazioni pubbliche. Da settimane la loro storia d'amore domina le prime pagine della cronaca rosa di riviste e siti di informazione.\nLe prime foto della 22enne napoletana, figlia di una facoltosa famiglia di imprenditori partenopei, insieme al conduttore Rai erano iniziate a circolare a fine giugno, ma la conferma della relazione è arrivata solo di recente. Da quando la loro storia è stata ufficializzata il gossip si è scatenato e la curiosità morbosa attorno alla coppia ora è sfociata in una vicenda dai contorni torbidi.netiquette.\nQuile norme di comportamento per esteso.",

    "text": "\\n The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an urgent warning about two critical vulnerabilities in Palo Alto Networks Expedition that malicious actors are actively exploiting. These flaws, identified as CVE-2024-9463 and CVE-2024-9465, pose a significant risk to organizations using the Expedition platform, potentially leading to complete system compromise.\n\\n CVE-2024-9463: OS Command Injection Vulnerability (CVSS 9.9)\n\\n This highly critical vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges. Successful exploitation could grant attackers access to sensitive information such as firewall usernames, passwords, and API keys.\n\\n CVE-2024-9465: SQL Injection Vulnerability (CVSS 9.2)\n\\n This flaw enables attackers to inject malicious SQL code into Expedition\\u2019s database, allowing them to extract sensitive data. Compromised information could include password hashes, usernames, device configurations, and API keys, potentially providing attackers with the means to take complete control of the system.\n\\n Exposed endpoints without authentication | Image: Horizon3.ai\n\\n Adding to the concern, security researcher Zach Hanley of Horizon3.ai has publicly released a proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2024-9465, making it easier for malicious actors to exploit this vulnerability.\n\\n Urgent Action Required\n\\nPalo Alto Networks has addressed these vulnerabilities in Expedition version 1.2.96 and urges all users to update their systems immediately. CISA has also added these vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating that all federal agencies patch their systems by December 5, 2024.\n\\n In addition to updating to the latest version, Palo Alto Networks recommends rotating all usernames, passwords, and API keys that have been processed by Expedition. Organizations should also restrict network access to Expedition, limiting it to authorized users only.\n\\n Related Posts: \\n\\n \\n",
