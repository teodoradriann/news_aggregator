    "text": "The two-year-old son of famed Canadian producer David Foster and singer Katharine McPhee is lighting up the internet with his musical talents. In a video posted to TikTok by McPhee and Instagram by Foster, the pair’s son is seen playing an impressive drum solo alongside a recording of Michael Jackson’s song “Rock with You.” Foster is seen in the video seated watching his son, bopping his head along to the beat while the two-year-old rocks out on a mini drum set complete with his name, Rennie Foster, splashed across the bass drum. McPhee’s video included the caption “my 2 year old baby is a genius.” Foster, the 74-year-old musician and composer, is a 16-time Grammy winner who was born in Victoria. He married McPhee, a 39-year-old singer and actress who was the runner-up in the 2006 season of American Idol, in 2019. Celebrities like Kristin Chenoweth, Questlove, Nicole Sherzinger, Joey McIntyre, Sharon Stone, Debra Messing, Charlie Puth and others took to the video comments to hype up the young drummer.

(WAFB) - Another record drug bust in Livingston Parish was reported after 100,000 lethal doses of fentanyl were seized by the sheriff’s office. It’s the largest fentanyl seizure in the parish’s history.\nRELATED:[ 4 people arrested, over 100K lethal doses of Fentanyl seized during drug bust](https://www.wafb.com/2024/12/19/4-people-arrested-over-100k-lethal-doses-fentanyl-seized-during-drug-bust/)\n”You have 150,000 population here, you have 100,000 pressed fentanyl pills, that’s enough to wipe out everybody here,” said Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard.\nArd says Tyrone Broadway, Eugene ‘Jake’ Skinner, Donald ‘Bo’ McCray, and Devonte Skinner were arrested after an investigation that spanned over two years.\n”It takes a while to do them because we want to do them right, we want to make sure these four individuals get a lot of time, I would like to see that they never come back into the streets again,” said Ard.\nArd believes these four alleged dealers are directly responsible for many of the overdoses in the parish.\n”Overall, through this investigation, we have seized over 100,000 pills, several vehicles, oxycodone, fentanyl, and methamphetamines. These guys were serious problems there’s no doubt responsible for some of these overdoses that we’ve worked,” added Ard.\nThis was just one of several large fentanyl busts this year in the parish, which means their narcotics division has grown.\n”Because of the narcotics and stuff we’ve been seeing because of our narcotics, we just added more agents to our narcotics so now we have more undercover narcotics and we did a couple of months ago,” explained Ard.\nWith their newly beefed up narcotics division, Ard says it’s only a matter of time before they get more drug dealers off the streets.\n”That just means we will be able to do more than what we were doing so I’m very excited about 2025 and if I was a drug dealer, I probably wouldn’t be excited about 2025,” said Ard, If you’re out here and you think slinging dope is cool, It’s going to be cool until you see us and you will see us eventually cause we’ll put you in jail.”\nDevonte Skinner, one of the four arrested, was also arrested back in April for another large fentanyl seizure in Livingston Parish. He was already in custody from that previous bust.\n[Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo.

Darby had just drained a 3-pointer to tie the game in the third quarter against Kentucky on Sunday, but Tennessee's 11-0 run was fueled with back-to-back blocks from Key. The second block from the senior center shut down Kentucky's Ajae Petty, who seemed unstoppable in a dominant first half for the Wildcats. The run gave [Lady Vols basketball](https://www.knoxnews.com/sports/womens-basketball/) all the momentum against Kentucky, erasing a 17-point first-half deficit to crush the Wildcats 87-69 at Thompson-Boling Arena at Food City Center.

It had seven in the first quarter, three of them by point guard Jasmine Powell. The Lady Vols had 10 turnovers by halftime. Jackson had five by halftime, two resulting from a travel violation and a charge. Tennessee got its turnovers under control in the second half and ended with 16.

The senior guard had one of her best games since the beginning of the season, turning momentum toward the Lady Vols in the second quarter.

    "text": "US President Joe Biden on Thursday said his deputy, Vice President Kamala Harris, is qualified to lead the county. At a press conference here, Biden said, From the very beginning, I made no bones about that. She is qualified to be the president. That's why I picked her. When asked about the reasons for this, he said Firstly because of the way she's handled the issue of freedom of women's bodies, to have control of their bodies and secondly, her ability to handle almost any issue on the board. This was a hell of a prosecutor. She was a first rate person and in the Senate, she was really good. I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be the president, Biden said. The president mistakenly referred to Kamala Harris as Donald Trump during the press conference. He said, I wouldn't have picked Trump to be the vice president, did I think she was not qualified to be president.... The fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once and I will beat him again, Biden said. The idea that senators and congressmen are running for office worrying about the ticket is not unusual. And I might add, there were at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in a campaign, he said. So, there's a long way to go in this campaign and so I'm just going to keep moving, he said.",

    "text": "The New Year is on the horizon and more freezing cold weather and snow could be on the way as we head into 2024, forecasters have warned.\nThe Met Office has delivered its verdict on another possible ‘Beast from the East’ hitting the UK, like the one we saw tear through the country back in 2018.\nThis chaotic weather event which brought hugely disruptive snowfall was caused by a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) – and it’s feared that these conditions could be repeated as we head into 2024.\nThe Mirror reports that a SSW occurs when stratospheric winds change direction and blow from east to west. They can also slow down, or stop entirely.\nThis triggers warming in the stratosphere, opening the pathway for easterly winds to move southwards which can weaken the jet stream. And occasionally, these winds can be accompanied by a cold air mass, causing the temperatures to drop dramatically.\nWoman walking through heavy snow\nThe Met Office has said that colder spells in January are likely, but have downplayed any certainty of a SSW as it may be too soon to tell for certain.\nThey said: “Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.”\nSpeaking to Sky News, Met Office spokesperson Stephen Dixon added: “It’s too early to tell if there will be a SSW event at the moment. Forecast models suggest a much weakened polar vortex over the coming weeks, but it’s not clear if this will result in an SSW or exactly how this will influence the UK’s weather patterns at this range.”\nThis comes after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc on much of the UK this week, causing severe power cuts and leaving thousands of people stranded on the roads due to snow and flooding.\nIt’s estimated that around 1,500 homes in Scotland faced a second night without power as Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said they had restored power to as many as 46,000 properties who had lost power due to the storm.\nShetland was one of the worst affected areas, as well as the north east of England. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”\nA supercell thunderstorm also moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday.\nAnd three men tragically lost their lives after their vehicle was submerged in the River Esk on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nDon’t miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

    "text": "Sagittarius Horoscope Prediction Today, 30-August-2024: It's a day to practice caution, says Ganesha. You are temperamental, irritable and restless today and this is likely to work against you. Avoid taking important decisions and beginning new tasks today. Your efforts may not reflect in your work, and this may displease your seniors. Be watchful about your detractors and competitors. Your children are a matter of concern and worry for you. In short, an average day for you today. Astrology Predictions: Sagittarius Love Horoscope Today You will spend an intimate time with your partner, nuzzling, and cuddle without a care in the world. Loving, caring and being truthful with your partner makes you the most demanded lover on the earth, feels Ganesha. You will create a soothing magic in the heart of your loved one. Astrology Predictions: Sagittarius Finance Horoscope Today Later in the day, Ganesha foresees that you will be balanced about your financial situation. Income or expenses will both receive equal consideration on your part. Weekly Horoscope, 26-August to 01-September-2024 Astrology Predictions: Sagittarius Career Horoscope Today Nothing will go wrong as luck will shine brightly today. You will start your day with loads of energy. Not the energy drink, this is the result of your powerful planetary position, foresees Ganesha. Energetic time is ahead in the career front.
