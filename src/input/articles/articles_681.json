    "title": "Strike appears likely as Boeing machinists vote on contract",
    "text": "(The Center Square) – More than 33,000 union workers are voting Thursday on a contract deal reached by Boeing and union leadership last weekend.\nJon Holden, president of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, helped to negotiate the deal, but told the Seattle Times he expected his members to vote down the deal and officially walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. Friday morning.\nIn a July 26 video update to members, Holden said a new more collaborative working relationship with the new Boeing CEO is what they’re after.\n“Recently, Stephanie Pope, CEO of BCA, did put out a message saying she met with me, and we are aligned on the future,” Holden said.\n“I did tell her, my hopes for what the future CEO of Boeing would be and how they interact with our union and how they would include our union in the future. I said she has the opportunity to change the relationship that we’ve had over the last 20 years,” he continued. “We need to stop being attacked. We need to be included in the vision for the future. That is something Boeing has the power to do and we’re demanding it in bargaining and that hasn’t happened yet.”\nAccording to Boeing, Pope served as chief operating officer for the company since January 2024. Before that, she was president and CEO of Boeing Global Services.\n“We’ll only know if we are aligned about the future of this company as we get through the economic issues, the job security issues that are so critical to our members going forward,” Holden said. “Stand strong, stay together and keep doing what you’re doing and I know we’ll be successful in the end.”\nThe strike would extend to Boeing’s major production plants in Everett, Renton, and Portland, Ore.\nThe last contract agreement for machinists in 2008 followed a two-month strike that analysts estimated cost the company more than $2 billion in profits.\nA strike at this point, especially if it drags on, would jeopardize industry suppliers and could further deplete Boeing’s aerospace market share at a time when the company is seeking to rebuild its global reputation.\nThe company believes it has offered a contract that gives workers generous raises, lower health coverage costs and offers a large contribution from the company to employee retirement plans.\nThe wage increases in Boeing’s offer would raise the wage to $130,000 in four years for the most experienced machinists. The entry-level mechanic wage would rise to $23 an hour immediately and to just over $30 an hour, or $62,400 annually, in four years.\nBoeing has also promised to build any new aircraft in the Seattle-Portland region, if launched during the four-year contract.\nThe union says the offer falls far short of their demands, which include a 40% pay increase and the restoration of pension plans, which were replaced with a 401(k) plan in recent years. The union is also upset about losing the traditional bonuses based on salary, that the company announced in March would be going away.\nBoeing said it was overhauling how it pays employee bonuses to emphasize quality and safety.\nThat announcement came after Boeing scrambled to explain and deal with safety procedures after a door panel detached during a Jan. 5 flight on a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9.\nUnder the new annual incentive plans, which will cover executives, managers and employees, safety and quality metrics will now account for 60% of the payout at Boeing’s commercial unit.\nOn a fact sheet, Boeing details what it calls the historic contract offer made to machinists. Some of those line items include:\nA $3,000 lump sum payment within 30 days, if contract is ratified by 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 12, with the ability to defer all or part to your Boeing 401(k);Affordable health care with lower cost share, plus plan improvements like a new free primary care benefit and a new company-paid long-term disability plan;Work-life balance improvements, including a new floating holiday, reduced mandatory overtime and 12 weeks of paid parental leave; andImproved short-term disability insurance Benefit increases to $750 per week from $280 to $330 per week.\nWorkers could walk off the job if more than 50% of those voting reject the deal and at least two-thirds reaffirm a previous vote to walk out.",

    "title": "Robert Pattinson Gives Fans A Coy Update On 'The Batman' Sequel",
    "text": "Is The Batman sequel making good progress? Robert Pattinson gives a cheeky reply to fans waiting for an update on the film.\nFans of The Batman are entering into a drought period. Ever since it was announced that the sequel was delayed once again, the internet has been itching for any detail they could find about the project to hold them over until set photos from the production start leaking, or another season of The Penguin gets announced. This even includes speculation that Robert Pattinson might join the mainline DC Universe!\n‘The Brave and the Bold’ Director Comments On Theories That Robert Pattinson Will Be The DC Universe’s Batman\nYet now that Robert Pattinson is on the road to help promote his upcoming film Mickey-17, fans are rabid to ask him anything they can about The Batman sequel. Sadly, it seems even the leading actor is in the dark about his future as the character. However, he did give a small tease that the eyes of his cowl may be changing when he finally makes a return.\n“I haven’t seen anything yet, so I have no idea,” Pattinson told Esquire when asked about the progress of The Batman sequel. “But I think maybe… a little more iris?”\nWhich Batman Actor Smells Best?\nRobert Pattinson doesn’t just have an eye for Batman, he also has the nose for it. In a separate part of the profile to his comments on the sequel, the actor spoke on the audition process for The Batman, revealing that he had to try on multiple different batsuits. According to the star, each one still had a distinct smell from their prior actors baked into the leather.\n“Definitely the scent of the cowl, with Batman – very much. Well, it’s leather. But it’s also a combination – because you’re sealed in a leather mask, but you’re also extremely anxious all the time. And leather is porous, so it really takes on an emotional scent.”\n“When I did the audition for Batman I had to try on all the different cowls [from actors who’d played the role]. Even from 20 years ago, they all still had the scent of each individual actor. It’s kind of strange. I think probably Clooney smelt the best.”\nIt certainly makes sense that Robert Pattinson would try on different batsuits prior to landing his role in The Batman, especially given what fans know about the audition process for the upcoming Superman movie. Though given how long it’s been since they filmed his first outing as the Caped Crusader, Pattinson should hope his stench hasn’t been marinating the whole time!\nThe Batman sequel is currently set to release October 1, 2027.

    "text": "In Nordirland ist es nach einem mutmasslichen Übergriff auf ein Mädchen in der dritten Nacht in Folge zu Ausschreitungen gekommen.\nIn Ballymena sei die Polizei unter anderem mit Brandbomben, einem Beil und Ziegelsteinen beworfen worden, meldete die Nachrichtenagentur PA. Im benachbarten Larne sei ein Freizeitzentrum in Brand geraten. Die genaue Anzahl der Verletzten war am Donnerstagmorgen zunächst offen.\nDie Unruhen hatten begonnen, nachdem zwei Jugendliche versucht haben sollen, ein Mädchen zu vergewaltigen. Die 14-Jährigen hatten den Vorwurf vor Gericht zurückgewiesen. Ihre Nationalität ist unklar – die Polizei hatte am Dienstag von rassistisch motivierten Unruhen gesprochen. In den Nächten auf Dienstag und Mittwoch waren über 30 Einsatzkräfte verletzt worden.\nLaut BBC und PA waren in dem Freizeitzentrum in Larne zwischenzeitlich Familien untergebracht, die ihr Zuhause Ballymena infolge der Ausschreitungen hatten verlassen müssen. Sie sollen zum Zeitpunkt des Brandanschlags nicht mehr im Gebäude gewesen sein.\nDer britische Premierminister Keir Starmer hatte die Unruhen in Nordirland «aufs Schärfste verurteilt». Nordirlands Co-Regierungschefin Michelle O'Neill sagte, es sei «purer Rassismus, anders kann man es nicht bezeichnen».\nDer Fall erinnert an die Folgen der Messerattacke im englischen Southport im Sommer 2024, nach der es in mehreren britischen Städten zu rechtsextremen Ausschreitungen gekommen war. Ein Jugendlicher hatte mit einem Messer bewaffnet einen Taylor-Swift-Tanzkurs gestürmt und um sich gestochen. Drei Mädchen starben, viele weitere Kinder wurden verletzt. Über die Nationalität des Täters hatten sich insbesondere über die sozialen Medien Falschinformationen verbreitet. (nib/sda/dpa)",

    "text": "A gradual loss of brain tissue is a natural part of aging, but one of the longest-running brain scan studies has now revealed some people's neural connections deteriorate faster than others once they hit middle age.\nAccording to a decades-long trial that began in 1995, those who show higher losses in white matter – the tissue that contains nerve fibers – have an 86 percent greater risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nCompared to those without a metabolic disease, those with type 2 diabetes lost significantly more white matter over time, and this group ultimately faced a 41 percent higher risk of developing MCI.\nWhat's more, people with biomarkers of dementia in their cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) had a nearly 50 percent higher risk of cognitive impairment.\nIf an individual had both diabetes and biomarkers of amyloid plaques (which are associated with Alzheimer's disease), that risk jumps to 55 percent.\nPrevious studies have also shown that significant losses in white matter are tied to cases of dementia, and that metabolic disorders can elevate a person's risk of cognitive decline.\nBut this is the first study to show a synergistic relationship between diabetes and amyloid plaques when it comes to their impact on white matter.\n\"These findings highlight that white matter volume changes are closely associated with cognitive function in aging, suggesting that white matter degeneration may play a crucial role in cognitive decline,\" write the authors of the study, led by neuroscientists at Johns Hopkins University in the United States.\n\"As insulin resistance plays a critical role in the formation of amyloid plaques, diabetes may promote Alzheimer's disease pathology, resulting in an earlier progression from normal cognition to MCI.\"\nThe long-term study was conducted among a group of 185 participants, who were mostly well-educated and White, with a family history of dementia.\nIt's not clear how well the findings will translate to more diverse populations, but most long-term MRI studies to date have been limited to less than a decade, and many only take two time points into account.\nThis newest study is impressively long, albeit small, tracking the brain shapes and sizes of participants at multiple points in their lives.\nFor up to 27 years, scientists regularly scanned the brains of participants, who started the trial with unimpaired cognition between the ages of 20 and 76.\nAt the end of the trial, 60 participants had progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 8 of those participants went on to develop dementia.\nEach person had their brain scanned about five times, and based on those images, it seems that it's normal as you age to gradually lose cortical gray matter, which contains neuron bodies, as well as white matter, which conducts messages between neurons.\nWhat is unusual, however, is a more rapid deterioration in white matter, starting in middle age. Participants who experienced the greatest declines in white matter volumes, year to year, were far more likely to develop symptoms of MCI.\nWhile only eight participants had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, the authors say their results suggest \"that controlling diabetes may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's dementia later in life as a modifiable risk factor.\"\nRecent research, for instance, has shown that some drugs that treat type 2 diabetes are linked to a 35 percent lower risk of dementia in patients.\nPhysician-scientist Shohei Fujita, who was not involved in the study, reviewed the findings in an invited commentary for JAMA's Neurology.\nFujita applauds the \"extended time frame\" of the trial, and he hopes the findings \"enable researchers and clinicians to develop targeted interventions for those most susceptible to progressive brain changes.\"\nNotably, 63 percent of the cohort were women, and Fujita points out that \"gender and race are also crucial variables that must be considered\" in future longitudinal research.\nAfter all, cognitive decline and dementia do not impact everyone in the same way. The way each individual brain shrinks with age is bound to be highly variable.\nThe study was published in JAMA Network.",

    "text": "When it comes to Valentine’s Day, the focus is usually on men getting the right gift so their gals know they are loved. But men want to know that they are loved too, and apparently women aren’t doing such a great job of showing that.\nA new survey by Manly Man Co, finds\n70.5% off men say admit they get bad presents on Valentine’s Day. And this is despite 55.9% of men who say they plant suggestions to their partner in order to get better gifts. And it sure sounds like gals could benefit from giving better presents. That’s because 67% of men say they are more likely to 'give romantic favors' for better Valentine's Day gifts. Overall, 74.7% of Americans say women get the better gifts on Valentine’s Day, with 50.2% of women agreeing. When it comes to who gives the better gifts, 50.9% of men believe they do, while 49.1% of women think they are the better gift giver. But while people think they are good Valentine’s Day gift givers, it sounds like not many people actually are. In fact, 36.4% of those polled say they've never been excited by a Valentine’s Day gift from their partner, while 34.5% say they can’t remember the last time they were. Source: Yahoo Finance",

The theatre said soldiers also arrested several employees in their homes.\nTobasi, who said he was among those detained, is now back at work and determined to keep the centre open.\n“For me, this is resistance,” the 39-year-old said as he gave AFP a tour of the theatre, which was set up in 2006.\nSoon after the raid on December 13 a Freedom Theatre appeal for the release of its staff won international support, with demonstrations in the streets of New York and Paris and playwrights, actors and directors from Britain to Mexico expressing their support.\nSince its founding, the unassuming performance space has become symbolic for Palestinians and their supporters, with its actors touring the world staging plays.\nStaff said they believed Israeli forces had gone out of their way to target the theatre.\nThe Israeli forces described the wider raid on Jenin, which Palestinian health authorities say killed 11 people, as designed to combat “terrorists” in the camp.\n“This is a theatre — there are no weapons or terrorists here,” Tobasi said.\nWhile the raid targeted a number of buildings in the camp, Tobasi said that to reach the theatre troops would have needed to turn off the main road and walk around 20 metres towards its entrance.\nAnother staff member, Ranin Odeh, said the centre was singled out for its reputation as “a place of resistance through art”.\n“I felt so angry to see Israeli soldiers inside. The theatre is like my home. They want to kill everything — not just people, but ideas too,” said the 31-year-old, who runs the theatre’s youth programme.\nStaff spent several days clearing up and plan to stage their first big event, an end-of-year workshop for young actors, on Sunday.\nThe army has not responded to AFP’s request for comment.\nDoor-to-door arrests\nAt the scene, Tobasi led AFP journalists past broken locks, splintered doorframes and smashed black and white photos.\n“What kind of behaviour is this from soldiers?” he said, standing next to a red Star of David sprayed across a projector screen.\nThe theatre posted an image on social media which appears to show troops and a military vehicle just outside the building. AFP has not been able to verify the picture.\nSoldiers went door to door arresting members of staff from their homes, the Freedom Theatre said in a series of online statements, adding they were among more than 100 Palestinians detained in Jenin.\nDrama graduate Jamal Abu Joas was released after more than a week in detention, while producer and manager Mustafa Sheta remains in custody, said Tobasi, who was still shaken from his own ordeal.\nTobasi said he was blindfolded, had his hands cuffed behind his back and was held for more than 12 hours at the Salam checkpoint west of Jenin. He accused army reservists of beating him.\nViolence in the West Bank — captured by Israel during the 1967 June War and occupied ever since — has surged following October 7.\nIsraeli forces and settlers have killed at least 314 people in the territory, Palestinian health officials say.\nJenin’s refugee camp, a stronghold for Palestinian armed groups, is regularly targeted by Israel in deadly raids. The Palestinian health ministry says many of those killed have been civilians.\nTobasi, who was born in and grew up in the camp, said the theatre had given him a way to resist occupation without violence. It was a break from the reality of life in the camp and a chance to imagine an alternative.\nFollowing the raid, he was more convinced than ever of the centre’s power.\n“Theatre is the place where we can express, fight and resist all,” Tobasi said.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Ottawa County, Kansas from 1901-2000 was 30.4. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Ottawa County, Kansas experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Ottawa County, Kansas history.",
