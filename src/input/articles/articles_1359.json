    "title": "Lagos State has a housing problem - here's how to fix it, By 'Mide Alabi",
    "text": "The Lagos housing crisis isn’t just about buildings. It’s about fairness, opportunity, and the kind of city Lagos wants to become. Without urgent, smart action, decent housing will remain a dream for millions. This is a crisis that threatens the social fabric of our city, pushing the middle class to the brink and leaving too many without a decent place to call home.\nI want to write about a matter that hits close to home for every Lagosian, especially people currently trying to move spaces: housing. But not the fancy, glossy kind you see in adverts. I mean the real struggle of finding a decent, affordable place to live in a city bursting at the seams.\nWhat’s Really Going On?\nLagos is booming. With over 20 million people, it is one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world. But here’s the catch: the city has a housing deficit of about 17 million units, yes, 17 million! That’s a whole lot of people, and that’s according to the Lagos State Ministry of Housing.\nNow, one might think, “just build more houses.” Sounds simple, doesn’t it? But as we know, like most things in this country, it’s really not that straightforward.\n|\n---|\nThe Crazy Numbers\nRent prices in Lagos are through the roof. A one-bedroom apartment in a regular, non-plush area can set you back between ₦800,000 and ₦3 million a year (roughly $2,000 to $7,500). In posh areas like Ikoyi or Victoria Island, rents can exceed ₦5 million per month, that’s more than a large majority of Lagosians make in a whole year.\nAnd if you think paying in naira is bad enough, many developers demand payment in US dollars. Last year, a popular TikToker, Scott Iguma, gained some notoriety for addressing this issue and even got slammed with a lawsuit for calling a Nigerian company out.\nDespite Nigerian laws and agencies like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC ) trying to stop this, it still happens, making housing even more out of reach for the average person.\nWhy the Dollar Pricing?\nDevelopers say they fear the naira’s instability and inflation, so they want dollars to protect their investments. But this just pushes housing further out of reach of most Lagosians. Imagine needing dollars just to pay rent or buy a home, when you earn and spend in naira. It is exhausting and unfair.\nWhat’s Driving these Insane Prices?\n- Lagos’s population is growing faster than new homes can be built. With an annual growth rate of about 3.2 per cent, Lagos adds roughly 500,000 people every year, according to the National Population Commission. That’s half a million people needing homes annually.\n- Our land laws are complicated and slow. Getting land cleared and approved for housing development can take years, adding costs and delays.\n- Developers prefer building luxury estates where they can make big profits, leaving few affordable options for ordinary people.\n- Many properties are held as investments and left vacant, which tightens supply and drives prices up.\n- Poor infrastructure, bad roads, inconsistent power, and unreliable transport pushes people to cluster in specific, expensive neighbourhoods.\nOne more to add as well – people actually buy these places. As someone who currently works in real estate, I’ll be the first to tell you that if there wasn’t a market for it, more and more developers wouldn’t continue to build and set these arbitrary prices. And yet they continue. The truth is: it has to be profitable.\nAnd What About the People?\nA significant number of Lagosians live in informal settlements. Think Makoko, one of the largest floating slums in Africa. These areas often lack clean water, proper sanitation, or security.\nWhen governments try to “clean up” the city, these communities get pushed out without alternatives, deepening social problems.\nThe middle class isn’t spared either. Studies show many Lagosians spend 40-50 per cent of their monthly income on rent, according to a 2022 Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) survey; money that could be spent on food, education, or healthcare.\nThis housing crisis is a mirror reflecting Lagos’ growing social divide. The market is basically split between the ultra-rich, who can afford luxury estates charging millions, and the poor, who struggle in overcrowded slums. The middle class is being squeezed, with fewer and fewer affordable options that fit their budgets and needs.\nIn other words, the housing market says: you’re either “rich” or “poor.” But Lagos desperately needs more middle-class housing that is decent, affordable, and accessible to the hardworking residents, who form the backbone of the city’s economy.\nThe shrinking middle class and the lack of suitable housing for them isn’t just an economic issue; it’s a social time bomb, fueling tension and inequality.\nAn actionable P.L.A.N\nNow that we know what issues are, naturally the question one would ask would be, “so what do we do now?”\nThat’s a good question, and I have some ideas.\nI’ve structured these ideas into an actionable project plan, which I have assigned the acronym “P.L.A.N”.\nThis is short for;\nP – Policy Reform\nL – Land Access and Management\nA – Affordable Housing Incentives\nN – Neighbourhood Infrastructural Upgrade\n1. POLICY REFORM\nCurrent Challenges:\n- Complex, overlapping land and housing regulations, slow approvals.\n- Corruption and lack of transparency increase costs and delays.\n- Fragmented responsibilities across multiple agencies cause inefficiency.\nAction Steps:\n- Create a unified legal framework that simplifies land and housing policies.\n- Establish a centralised digital platform for all housing-related approvals.\n- Set up an independent anti-corruption task force targeting the land and housing sectors.\n- Regularly review and update policies with stakeholder input.\nExpected Outcomes:\n- Faster, more predictable approval processes.\n- Reduced corruption-related costs and delays.\n- Improved coordination between agencies, increasing efficiency.\nCase Study: Vienna, Austria\n- LAND ACCESS MANAGEMENT\nCurrent Challenges:\n- Lengthy, costly land acquisition processes discourage development.\n- Lack of accurate, digital land records lead to disputes.\n- Limited availability of land designated for affordable housing.\nAction Steps:\n- Digitise and geospatially map all land registries.\n- Establish government-owned land banks earmarked for affordable housing projects.\n- Simplify land transfer and lease processes.\n- Secure land tenure for informal settlement residents.\nExpected Outcomes:\n- Quicker, transparent land acquisition.\n- Increased land availability for affordable housing.\n- Reduced land disputes and improved tenure security.\nCase Study: Kigali, Rwanda\n-\nAFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES\nCurrent Challenges:\n- Developers focus on luxury housing due to higher profits.\n- High construction and financing costs deter affordable projects.\n- Lack of clear incentives reduces private sector participation.\nAction Steps:\n- Introduce tax incentives and VAT exemptions for affordable housing developers.\n- Provide subsidised long-term financing options and loan guarantees.\n- Fast-track permit approvals and reduce fees for affordable housing.\n- Promote public-private partnerships with risk-sharing arrangements.\nExpected Outcomes:\n- Increased supply of affordable housing units.\n- Greater private sector involvement.\n- Lower cost of housing for middle and low-income families.\nCase Study: Singapore\n-\nNEIGHBOURHOOD INFRASTRUCTURAL UPGRADE\nCurrent Challenges:\n- Poor roads, unreliable electricity, and lack of transport in affordable housing areas.\n- Informal settlements lack basic services and legal recognition.\n- Limited social infrastructure affects livability.\nAction Steps:\n- Develop integrated infrastructure plans aligned with housing projects.\n- Expand public transport to connect affordable neighbourhoods with economic centres.\n- Implement decentralised renewable energy solutions.\n- Upgrade informal settlements with community participation and secure tenure.\n- Build schools, clinics, markets, and recreational facilities in new neighbourhoods.\nExpected Outcomes:\n- Improved quality of life and attractiveness of affordable housing areas.\n- Enhanced access to jobs and services.\n- Empowered communities with safer, healthier living conditions.\nCase Study: Curitiba, Brazil\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Lagos housing crisis isn’t just about buildings. It’s about fairness, opportunity, and the kind of city Lagos wants to become. Without urgent, smart action, decent housing will remain a dream for millions. This is a crisis that threatens the social fabric of our city, pushing the middle class to the brink and leaving too many without a decent place to call home.\nA good number of people I know, mostly Gen Zers and entry-level employees, cannot afford to live in even moderately decent areas of the state. Instead, they’re forced to retain campus-like accommodation even after graduation, live with their parents for extended periods, or “squat” with someone who lives fairly close to their offices.\nWe cannot afford complacency or half-measures. The time for bold, inclusive, and urgent action is now. Policymakers, developers, community leaders, and everyday Lagosians must come together to demand transparent reforms, equitable housing policies, and sustained investments that prioritise affordability and accessibility.\nIf we truly want Lagos to be a city of opportunity and dignity, housing must be at the forefront of our collective agenda. Let’s move beyond promises and take decisive steps, because decent housing is not a privilege, it is a fundamental right.\nPrivate and public stakeholders have a great commitment to make in this regard, and even as much as we love to see the great architecture and serenity of their more highbrow projects in Banana Island and Eko Atlantic, the people who buy these homes are statistically less than 1 per cent of our entire population. We need affordable housing for the 99 per cent.\nI strongly believe that this is achievable, and I have brought up a couple of action points and a strategy which the government can use as a template to develop the housing sector moving forward.\nLagos cannot wait. The millions who dream of a home deserve solutions today.\n‘Mide Alabi, a lawyer, writes from Lagos.

    "text": "By Zak Failla ,\n59 minutes ago The cat tested positive for rabies. Photo Credit: Frederick County Department of Health An alert was issued on Thursday, Aug. 15, advising the community that a cat that was tracked down in the 3000 block of Garfield Road that later tested positive for the virus after attacking two people.\nOfficials say that on Wednesday, there were multiple reports about a stray cat who had become feral and went after people in the area. It was picked up by Frederick County Animal Control in the area of Garfield Road, John Cline Road, and Brown Road.\nThe rabies-positive cat is described as a dark gray domestic shorthair female most likely under a year old with a white neck, chest, belly, and paws.\nThe Health Department is recommending that anyone who may have had contact with the cat between Wednesday, July 31 and Aug. 14 consult their health care provider and to notify the agency's Community Health Services Office by calling (310) 600-3342.\nAccording to health officials, \"rabies is a viral disease that mainly infects mammals and is spread through the saliva of the infected animal, usually by a bite.\"\nSymptoms of rabies in animals may include fear of water, excessive salivation, failure to eat or drink, limping, unusually friendly or aggressive behavior, and/or other atypical behaviors such as nocturnal animals emerging during the daytime.\nThe disease is nearly always fatal to humans once infected if no prompt post-exposure treatment is given.\nBarry Glotfelty, Director for FCHD’s Environmental Health Services said, “Mammals can be infected with the rabies virus so do not touch or play with unknown animals, and make sure your pets are vaccinated.”\nOwners of pets who may have been exposed to the cat can also call the department's Environmental Health Office at (301) 600-1717.\nWant breaking news in the DMV as it happens, or want to contribute?

    "text": "Daniel Briceño le mando vainazo al exsenador Gustavo Bolívar\nGustavo Bolívar, uno de los principales líderes del Pacto Histórico, ha utilizado su cuenta personal de X (Twitter) para mostrar las fuertes caídas que ha sufrido el precio del dólar en Colombia durante los últimos días y asegurar que el país va por buen camino.\n“Sentido pésame a quienes se dejaron embaucar por economistas anti petristas, faltos de ética porque la macroeconomía no se puede medir en simpatías, y compraron dólar a $5.000 porque llegaría a $7.000. Colombia va bien, es la segunda moneda más valorizada del mundo”, indicó el martes pasado.\nLuego, el exsenador agregó: “El dólar sigue bajando [en Colombia]. Hoy 27 de diciembre: $3.843. Si baja de $ 3.800, el Banco de la República debería comprar para detener la caída que ya empieza a afectar exportadores. Cosechando Logros”.\nFrente a estas publicaciones, el abogado Daniel Briceño no se quedó callado y aprovechó el Día de los Inocentes, el cual se celebra todos los 28 de diciembre, para mandarle una fuerte pulla al excongresista de la República, dejándolo en evidencia. “Una Inocentada es decir que el país va bien”, precisó.",

    "text": "“Jaldi karo [hurry up]. We must serve food before 5.50pm. Sun can set early, and we cannot keep them waiting in hunger,” says Ram Dev, as he adjusts his navy-blue skull cap. Dev is supervising Murali, Komal and 26 other volunteers, including children, of the Sufi Dar Trust who are shifting the iftar meals from a van to the Walajah Big Mosque in Chennai’s Triplicane area. The volunteers have cooked food for around 1,200 people at the Sufi Dar temple on Dr Radhakrishnan Road in Mylapore. It is ready to be distributed and served to Muslims who are about to break their Ramzan fast in the evening. Buckets of fried rice, pickle, bananas, kesar milk, water, dates, nuts and biscuits are unloaded from the van and transferred to paper plates. Volunteers then serve people sitting in the mosque’s courtyard. ‘Nombu’ gruel is also distributed in bowls. medium108844476 medium108845084 At a time when religious intolerance is prevalent, this temple and its volunteers are testimony to the belief that unity and harmony can prevail no matter one’s faith. This 40-year-old tradition was introduced by Dada Ratanchand, a Hindu, who came from Sindh (now in Pakistan) and took refuge in Chennai during Partition. Ratanchand established the Sufi Dar Trust, which set up this temple that propagates the teachings of Sufi saint Shahenshah Baba Nebhraj Sahib of Sindh. Built of white marble, there is a sense of peace that pervades Sufi Dar. For devotees of Shahenshah Baba, this temple is a place of pilgrimage. “All gods are one, said our guruji. We wear skull caps while serving our Muslim brothers iftar meals as a mark of respect for their sentiments and to ensure sweat and hair do not fall into the food,” says Dev. “It is a spiritual time for us too,” he adds. Dev’s dedication is apparent. He was part of the family business of automobiles earlier. “But I could not do this service efficiently. So, I broke away from the business. Now, I get more time for seva,” he says. medium108844591 There are other volunteers too, some of whom have moved from other parts of the country such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan to settle in Chennai. There are also those who specially come down from outside India during this time. Komal shifted from Chennai some time ago and now owns an LED manufacturing unit in Dubai. During Ramzan, she makes it a point to return to Chennai to assist in providing iftar meals at the mosque. “From childhood, I have been doing this seva every year with my family. A year doesn't go by without coming to India for Ramzan,\\\" she says. medium108844693 The Sufi Dar volunteers say they observe all festivals irrespective of religion. At the temple, Id, Navratri and Christmas are celebrated with equal enthusiasm – havans are performed during Navratri, carols are sung on Christmas and iftar is served during Ramzan. Inside the temple, dua is recited, and aarti and bhajans are sung for Durga, Ram and Shiva with fervour, even as Jesus is prayed to with devotion. The Sufi Dar Trust’s website says, “Pictures of several Sufi saints, Hindu saints and mystics, Jesus Christ and Mother Mary, Guru Nanak and other Sikh gurus, religious leaders of Radhaswami and Chidakashi sects and Sai Baba adorn the walls...Marble statues of Lord Ganesh, Laxmi Narayan, Shiva Parvati, Radha Krishna, Lord Ram, Sita, Laksman, Hanuman, Durga Mata and Jhulelal Sain are tastefully arranged and placed there. Every visitor, irrespective of his faith, is sure to behold his favourite deity and feel at home in Sufi Dar” medium108844810 Four-decade-old relationship The mosque and the temple have had a long relationship that dates back decades. The mosque was built by the nawab of Arcot, Mohammad Ali Khan Wallajah, in 1794 AD – it is today the largest mosque in Chennai. According to historian Kombai S Anwar, whom TOI spoke to earlier, “The nawab was known for his liberal donations cutting across religions.” Members of the Arcot royal family periodically checked the temple kitchen set up by Ratanchand some 40 years ago for hygiene and cleanliness. It was during that time they got into an agreement for the latter to make iftar food for Muslims fasting during Ramzan. medium108844919 Ram says there is no hundi or collection box inside Sufi Dar. “If people want to give something, our guruji asks them to bring biscuits, sweets or fruits. But some people who have been coming to the temple for decades anonymously donate money. We use that for seva.\\\" Fifty-year-old Jamila, a Muslim, who has just finished her iftar meal, is grateful for this service. She says, “I work near the mosque, but my house is in Pallavaram [a neighbourhood in Chennai some distance away]. During Ramzan, I can break my fast here and then go home after work.”Also read more such inspiring stories here.Photo: C Suresh Kumar",
