    "text": "What Detroit Tigers like about top international signee Cris Rodriguez, three others Evan Petzold Detroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nDetroit Tigers talk about Cris Rodriguez in 2025 international class Detroit Tigers executives Miguel Garcia and Rob Metzler talk to reporters January 15, 2025, about signing top international prospect Cris Rodriguez. Detroit Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris traveled to the Dominican Republic. The purpose of his visit was twofold: to welcome the team's newest international players and to show support for the team's international scouts.\nDuring the trip, Harris shook hands with Cris Rodriguez .\nHarris thinks Rodriguez rakes.\nLatin American scouting director Miguel Garcia agrees.\n\"Definitely he's got the ability to hit for average, and he's going to develop legit power down the road,\" said Garcia, who led the scouting efforts when the Florida Marlins signed Miguel Cabrera in 1999 and has worked for the Tigers since 2005. \"His frame, his body and the projection that he has leads us to believe that definitely he's going to hit for power.\"\nELITE RAW POWER: Tigers sign international prospect Cris Rodriguez to franchise-record $3.2 million bonus\nThe Tigers signed Rodriguez — a 16-year-old right-handed hitting outfielder from the Dominican Republic — for a franchise-record $3.2 million bonus ($3,197,500, to be exact) when the 2025 international signing period began Wednesday morning. The teenager put pen to paper in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nRodriguez, who turns 17 on Jan. 28, is ranked No. 4 by Baseball America , No. 4 by MLB Pipeline and No. 9 by FanGraphs among all prospects in the 2025 international class, which is led by Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki .\nHe will spend the 2025 season in the Dominican Summer League.\n\"The physical ability we believe to be special,\" said assistant general manager Rob Metzler , the second-highest-ranking executive in attendance when Rodriguez signed with the Tigers. \"We love the bat speed, the power, the bat path. We love the athleticism, the frame, the natural projection.\n\"I'd follow that up by saying we feel strongly about the kid. Work ethic, character, aptitude we believe to be pluses. That's what he's shown us over a significant amount of time. We're excited to be able to sign him.\"\nDECISION TIME: Tigers didn't meet with Japanese ace Roki Sasaki — but credit new regime for trying\nThe Tigers have been scouting Rodriguez for at least the past two years.\nArea scout Rodolfo Peñalo , who lives full time in the Dominican Republic, identified Rodriguez, built a relationship with Rodriguez's family and helped the Tigers sign Rodriguez. He received support along the way from scouting supervisor Oliver Arias and crosschecker Pablo Arias .\nThe trio of scouts received support from Garcia and international operations director Tom Moore .\n\"Rodolfo Peñalo did a tremendous job following his development,\" Garcia said, \"and we were able to evaluate him on a consistent basis. Every time we came to the country, we were able to see him in games and see how he was progressing.\"\nMetzler — the assistant general manager who oversees the domestic and international scouting efforts — discussed the process of signing Rodriguez, which involved almost every department in the Tigers' organization.\nIt didn't used to be that way.\n\"How do you build relationships? It takes time,\" Metzler said. \"Up and down the scouting staff and then, more recently, connectivity, more access to different parts of the organization, as we've been able to do that, has been very beneficial to build this relationship.\"\nCris Rodriguez takes batting practice today, signs with the #Tigers tomorrow.\nThe outfielder from the Dominican Republic, who turns 17 on Jan. 28, ranks as the No. 4 international prospect in the 2025 class, according to @MLBPipeline and @BaseballAmerica . pic.twitter.com/NSOqQU2BCe\n— Evan Petzold (@EvanPetzold) January 14, 2025 To clarify, Metzler was referring to significant changes in how the Tigers function on a day-to-day basis since Harris took control of baseball operations in September 2022 (replacing fired general manager Al Avila ). After that, Harris hired Metzler to oversee amateur scouting in October 2022 .\nA DEEP DIVE: Can Tigers improve results with prospects signed from international market?\nThe changes to the process have allowed the Tigers to gain a better understanding about what every individual player plan will look like from all perspectives, such as skill development, strength and conditioning, performance science, nutrition and medical, among other things.\nThe Tigers are more connected than ever before.\n\"This was a full departmental and full organizational effort for something like this to come together,\" Metzler said. \"I thought this department and the staff worked tremendously well together.\"\nAll of the changes started in the front office.\nThat's why it was important when Harris showed face Wednesday in the Dominican Republic, not only to welcome Rodriguez and other international signees but also to spend time with the international scouts.\n\"There should be a lot of handshakes and pats on the back for all of the effort that went into something like this,\" Metzler said. \"I would also highlight that we believe in Cris' ability, but this is one step along a hard and challenging journey.\"\nJose Ramirez, Carlos Benavides, Anderson Diaz For Rodriguez, the Tigers spent 42% of their $7.6 million bonus pool ($7,555,500, to be exact) for the entire 2025 international signing period, from Jan. 15 to Dec. 15.\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Days of Roar\" your go-to Detroit Tigers podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts ( Apple , Spotify ) ]\nThe Tigers also signed two other players on Baseball America's top-100 list for international prospects in the 2025 class : Venezuelan center fielder Jose Ramirez (No. 54) and Venezuelan catcher Carlos Benavides (No. 62).\nRamirez, 16, signed for $900,000; Benavides, 17, signed for $800,000.\nHere's what Garcia said about Ramirez, a right-handed hitting center fielder: \"He has some catching experience in the past. We're signing him as a center fielder. He's a plus runner. He's going to have a plus arm down the road. He is definitely a guy that will develop some gap-to-gap power. He has an ability to hit for average. He's an athlete. The way that he moves around makes us believe that he's going to be able to play center field in Comerica Park.\"\nHere's what Garcia said about Benavides, a right-handed hitting catcher: \"He is a kid from Venezuela, but he has been developing here in the Dominican Republic for the last two years. Good defensive tools, and his bat is his calling card. His baseball IQ is pretty advanced for his age. He's definitely a kid that will give you everything he has in order to play the game in the right way.\"\nThe top three prospects — Rodriguez ($3.2 million), Ramirez ($900,000) and Benavides ($800,000) — cost a combined $4.9 million, using up nearly 65% of the bonus pool.\nAnother notable addition: The Tigers signed Venezuelan left-hander Anderson Diaz , who has been training at the academy operated by agent Felix Olivo that produced MLB lefties Martín Pérez and José Castillo .\nDiaz, 17, signed for $450,000.\nHis fastball averages 94 mph.\nHere's what Garcia said about Diaz, a left-handed pitcher: \"We followed him for like a year. We saw his development. When we first saw him, he was like 5 feet 9. Now this kid is 6-3 with a really interested type of body to develop and handle the workload for a young arm. We're excited. He's got close to an average fastball right now, and he's got a really good feel for pitching.\"\nContact Evan Petzold at epetzold@freepress.com or follow him @EvanPetzold .\nListen to our weekly Tigers show \"Days of Roar\" every Monday afternoon on demand at freep.com, Apple Podcasts , Spotify or wherever you listen to podcasts.

    "text": "KENOSHA, Wis. — Emily Giese is a star high school athlete who took one for the team on Thursday.\nThe Tremper High School junior was one of approximately 140 students who helped organize the annual Tremper Blood Drive, the state’s largest student-run blood drive.\nGiese not only helped plan the event and recruit donors, but she gave blood as well, which is not an easy task for someone who doesn’t necessarily do well with needles.\nTMJ4 News Emily Giese, Tremper High School junior.\n“I like helping people,” Giese said. “I know this is another way I can do that.”\nThe Tremper Blood Drive is run by the school’s student government. It’s generated over 26,000 donations (one pint per donation), which has helped save over 78,000 lives.\nOrganizers set a goal of 540 donations on Thursday. That would top 537 donations from last year.\nPlanning for next year’s event starts Friday.\nTremper special education teacher Kendra Richter, a 2013 Tremper graduate, is the event organizer. She took over for longtime event organizer Todd Hardy who retired last year.\n“I’m a little biased but I think the Tremper students are pretty awesome,” Richter said. “I like the community gets to come and see them be leaders and really take time and effort to put on an event that serves people they won’t ever meet.”\nDonors must be at least 16 years old and weigh 110 pounds or more. A parent-guardian permission slip is required for 16-year-olds. Students 17 and older do not need a consent form.\n\"I think it means a lot to make that decision on your own and to be able to think for yourself, especially going into adulthood,” Tremper senior Maritza Martinez said.\nThe Tremper Blood Drive set a national record for student-led blood drives with 777 donations in 2016.",

    "text": "T he stock market ended 2023 on a positive note and is poised to have another year of gains as investors look to the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in the coming months.\nA lot has changed in just the past few months to arrive at that happy situation. While the Fed was once signaling rates would be higher for longer, part of a post-COVID-19 pandemic strategy to tame inflation, investors are now pricing in up to six rate cuts over the next year. And Fed officials are taking on a little more dovish tone. That is because recent inflation reports have shown meaningful declines, good news for the economy, and a nice turn for the markets .\nTHREE TIMES BIDEN FORGAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT DESPITE SUPREME COURT RULING\nThe S&P 500 is now up more than 5% in just the past month alone and rose 25% since the start of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has bounced 6.5% in the past month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up a whopping 45.5% from the start of 2023.\nQuincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said that the most recent consumer price index report, which showed inflation running at a cooler 3.1% pace, helped underpin and confirm that prices were coming down at a faster clip. That is hopeful for investors eager for rate cuts.\n“Not at the point that the Fed could declare victory, but that it is moving in the right direction,” she told the .\nKrosby explained that this latest rally in the markets is better news because it’s more broad-based. She pointed out that it isn’t just a handful of major companies leading the indices higher, but rather small- and mid-cap stocks have also climbed. Notably, the Russell 2000 has popped nearly 15% in the past month alone.\n“The Russell 2000 is a barometer for economic conditions at the most granular level,” she said. “It sends a positive signal.”\nKrosby said that U.S. markets should end up having a decent year. That is because, historically speaking, when there is a strong year for the stock market, as 2023 was, the following year tends to end as a positive one.\n“When all is said and done, the market seems to focus on what the Fed is going to do and the expectations are that the Fed will deliver rate cuts,” Krosby said. “It may not be as early as the market suggests … but at some point, the market expects that there will be rate cuts.”\nA recent report from John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, predicts that the S&P 500 will end up being around the level it is at now when 2024 comes to a close.\n“Fortunately, corporate profits are set to gain traction as we expect market growth to reflect earnings gains. Our base case scenario has the S&P Index fairly valued in the 4,750 range by year-end 2024,” a summary of the report said.\nRodney Lake, vice dean for undergraduate programs at George Washington University and director of the university’s Investment Institute, told the that the perception of these coming rate cuts bodes well for the stock market. He expressed optimism for the year ahead.\n“Many people are expecting that rate cuts are coming, that very likely will continue to lift stocks higher and for our outlook at the GWU Investment Institute, is that the market will move higher in 2024 on a total return basis,” Lake said.\nLake said there are also uncertainties surrounding the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip. If those become broader conflicts involving more actors, it would have the potential to weigh on the equity market, Lake said.\nBut Lake said that outside of the wars broadening, the most significant obstacle for the stock market next year might be if declining inflation suddenly reverses course and begins to move higher. That could cause the Fed to not cut rates and could cause investors to become spooked.\n“In the worst-case scenario, that would get so bad that the market would have to start pricing in higher for longer and potentially an increase,” Lake said. “I think the probability of that is quite low at this point given where inflation has been trending … but I would say that inflation turning around and being higher than expected is probably the most significant thing that could derail a positive outlook for 2024.”\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThomas Mathews, a finance professor at Florida Gulf Coast University, told the that he sees four main drivers for stock performance this coming year: the overall economic performance of the U.S., the Fed’s monetary policy, price momentum, and the U.S. presidential election.\nMathews said he expects single-digit gains for the stock market next year and, at worst, says the market would only end up down by a percentage point or two.\nLatest Ferrari: More terrible than joyful By: Jack Baruth The cultural story of denazification By: Anthony Paletta Stick a spork in 2023 By: Rob Long Videos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

    "text": "El Gobierno decidió que pagará los dos bonos pendientes por $55.000 pesos cada uno a los jubilados que cobren el haber mínimo.\nEl beneficio, anunciado por el ex ministro de Economía Sergio Massa en octubre, se había pagado solamente en noviembre, pero hasta hoy no estaba confirmado por la administración de Javier Milei.\nHoy se firmó el decreto para que se paguen los $ 55.000 correspondientes al mes de diciembre, pero además trascendió que la Casa Rosada ordenó también pagar la tercera cuota en enero.\nFuentes oficiales destacaron a la prensa que la iniciativa se toma en función de \"la grave situación socioeconómica que atraviesa nuestro país, que ha ocasionado, entre otras cuestiones, un alza acelerada del índice de precios, con especial incidencia en los adultos mayores de menores ingresos, para quienes es necesario acudir a su sostenimiento\".\nLE PUEDE INTERESAR\nIncertidumbre por las jubilaciones\nLa decisión se dio a conocer en medio de la incertidumbre sobre lo que va a ocurrir con las jubilaciones de aquí en adelante, dado que en el proyecto de ley que el Gobierno envió al Congreso se suspende la aplicación de la fórmula de movilidad de los haberes previsionales, pensiones y planes sociales.\nEl artículo 106 de la Ley Ómnibus propone suspender la aplicación del artículo 32 de la Ley 24.241 que establece el ajuste de los haberes por jubilaciones y pensiones, de la que también dependen la Asignación Universal por Hijo (AUH) y la Asignación por Embarazo, entre otros beneficios. También se intenta suspender la vigencia para prestación básica universal, la compensatoria, el retiro por invalidez, por fallecimiento y por permanencia.\nPor ahora sigue la fórmula actual\nEl ministro confirmó que hasta que la ley se apruebe, si es que esto ocurre, los haberes se seguirán ajustando mediante la fórmula actual.\nEl último ajuste que surgió de esta fórmula dio un aumento del 20,87% desde diciembre y el próximo aumento se definirá en marzo. Hasta tanto se diseñe la nueva fórmula, Economía apunta a mantener las jubilaciones mínimas actualizadas por inflación y a otorgar en forma discrecional “aumentos periódicos atendiendo prioritariamente a los beneficiarios de más bajos ingresos”.\nCuando Massa hizo los anuncios sobre el bono complementario para los que cobran el haber mínimo, señaló que si era elegido presidente, el segundo bono correspondiente a enero sería de $ 65.000 y subiría a los $ 70.000 en febrero.",
