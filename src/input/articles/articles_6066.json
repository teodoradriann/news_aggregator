    "text": "Country musician Brian Kelley in July released a single on streaming platforms titled \"Make America Great Again\" after his performance at the 2024 Republican National Convention, which came less than a week after the assassination attempt on GOP presidential nominee former President Trump.Since the launch of the song, Kelley says he has been keeping a watchful eye on Big Tech censorship and trusts that the lack of viewership doesn’t add up.\"I thought it was kind of strange,\" Kelley told Fox News Digital of the missing \"share\" button on Apple Music streaming services.The Florida native said he tagged Apple Music on his social media posts, and within a day or two, the issue was reconciled. EXCLUSIVE: COUNTRY STAR BRIAN KELLEY TO RELEASE ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN’ SONG: ‘I’M A PROUD AMERICAN' Country singer Brian Kelley released the single \"Make America Great Again\" in mid-July after his performance at the 2024 Republican National Convention. (Getty Images) \"Maybe it was a bug. Maybe it was something else, but it shouldn't be that hard to just utilize the same tools that I've been utilizing with other songs,\" Kelley said.When Amazon Alexa was asked to \"play Brian Kelley\" by his band members' wives, Kelley said the cloud-based voice service instead played Brian McKnight.\"I love Brian McKnight,\" Kelley said. \"He’s great, but it’s just those things that are really, really interesting where it makes you think, it makes you wonder.\"Regarding Instagram, Kelley said the positive comments supporting the song are hidden.\"I've never really had that problem,\" Kelley said.The \"See You Next Summer\" singer said he received a number of comments from fans relaying their inability to share \"Make America Great Again\" on their platforms. ELON MUSK BLASTS GOOGLE OVER OMISSION OF TRUMP ASSASSINATION SEARCH SUGGESTIONS Instagram did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital when asked for comment.\"At the end of the day, this is nothing new,\" Kelley said. \"This is somewhat expected at this point when it comes to Big Tech censorship.\"Kelley called out Google regarding the missing results from the search engine giant’s auto-complete feature surrounding the assassination attempt on Trump in late July. Google denied manually tampering with the results to FOX Business at the time.\"We just have to be louder, and we just can't back down,\" Kelley said. \"We have to continue to get our message out there. We have to continue to fight. We have to not be afraid to speak our minds and stand for what we believe in and stand on our truth.\" COUNTRY SINGER FOCUSED ON FAMILY, GOD Kelley performed at the 2024 Republican National Convention. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) With regard to Spotify, Kelley said his song did not appear on playlists dedicated to new releases of the week.\"They’re not going to advertise it,\" Kelley said of Spotify. \"They're not going to put it out front.\"However, Kelley granted that Spotify has been \"good\" to him and promoted new music, including \"Acres,\" \"Kiss My Boots\" and \"Dirt Road Date Night,\" which were all playlisted.A source close to Spotify told Fox News Digital that the song \"isn’t censored\" and, in order to be, it would have broken rules and been removed entirely from the platform.\"Even though it's not on a playlist and a playlist that the artist would have liked, that doesn’t mean that it's censored,\" the source said. \"Anybody can find the song at any point.\" Kelley told Fox News Digital he is writing and recording new songs quickly in anticipation of new music this fall. (Jason Kempin/Getty Images) COUNTRY SINGER BRIAN KELLEY ‘SO GRATEFUL’ TO AMERICAN HEROES WHO FOUGHT TO ‘PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS’ Spotify declined to comment when Fox News Digital reached out.While Kelley feels quieted, he expressed his gratitude to Trump for posting the music to both Truth Social and Instagram.\"Right before he posted on Truth Social, he sent through my production manager a text message,\" Kelley said. \"It was a really, really sweet message. It was amazing. It felt great. It felt unreal.\"Kelley added that he’s heard through Trump’s circle of friends and staff members that the GOP presidential nominee has been \"blasting it\" on repeat. \"See You Next Summer\" singer Kelley is an outspoken Republican and thanks other country musicians like John Rich and Jason Aldean for paving the way for political music. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The country music veteran bid a thank-you to other musicians like Jason Aldean , Kid Rock and John Rich for forging an evolutionary path for other artists to be unapologetic of music that is \"a little bit political.\"\"To see Jason, who's really outspoken, loves this country, loves our military,\" Kelley said, \"it's those guys who have helped open the door for some of us to walk in a little easier.\"",

    "title": "Eating the Same Dinner Every Night for Two Weeks to See Benefits - Business Insider",
    "text": "Advertisement In an effort to cook more nutritious meals at home, I ate the same dinner for two weeks straight. I balanced my meal with protein and healthy fats from lentil pasta, vegetables, and a mixed salad. I loved the easy prep work, thought my body felt better, and even looked forward to dinnertime. I'm not someone who enjoys spending time in the kitchen and would rather end the day with takeout than cook myself a meal. However, after doing an audit of my finances, I realized I spent way too much money on dining out and needed to change my eating habits.\nSo, in an effort to save money and delete the daily stress of figuring out what to cook , I ate the same meal every single night for two weeks.\nAdvertisement Here's how it went.\nI chose an easy pasta and salad meal that was inexpensive to prepare and included a lot of nutrients I liked that I needed to grab the same few groceries when I went to the store. Jen Glantz Registered dietitian Lori Walker said it was important to think of a meal with all the nutrients I needed for optimal health. According to Walker, such a meal would include vegetables, a lean source of protein, and healthy fats.\nSince I'm a vegetarian, I decided my go-to meal would be lentil pasta, which has 12 grams of protein, alongside tomato sauce, a side of sautéed vegetables, and a mixed salad with avocado.\nAdvertisement Irene Mejia , a registered dietitian, also told me that eating the same healthy, balanced dinner like pasta and salad each night would also provide a consistent source of nutrition.\nDuring the experiment I ended up having more spare time to myself My new dinner saved me some time. Jen Glantz By doing this experiment, I hoped I'd save time since I usually took about an hour to prepare dinner . I typically spent 75% of that time figuring out what to eat and debating whether I should cook or order takeout. I also spent around an hour a week in the grocery store trying to figure out what ingredients I needed since I never planned my meals ahead.\nNow that I had a set plan for dinner, I saved at least three hours a week.\nAdvertisement I knew exactly what I needed at the grocery store and I'd cook two servings of the pasta and salad every other night so it would last me for two days. Since it was such a simple meal, it took me only about 10 to 15 minutes to make .\nPreparing and eating dinner took only about 30 minutes, allowing me an extra half-hour to do something relaxing and enjoyable each night.\nRelated stories Eventually, I got bored of the same meal Unfortunately, by the fourth night, I started to get tired of eating the same meal. I craved takeout from my favorite local spot and almost gave up on my eating challenge.\nAdvertisement However, I was motivated to continue when I reminded myself that I was doing this to consistently eat balanced, nutritious dinners.\nIn trying to stick with this one meal, I began adding spices like pepper and garlic powder and different salad dressings like ranch and balsamic to help make it taste a little bit different every night.\nStill, my body felt better, and I think it's because it was getting the nutrients I needed By day 10 of eating my pasta and salad meal, my palate got used to consuming the same thing, and I found myself looking forward to dinner. I think that may be because my body was happy it was getting the nutrients it needed .\nAdvertisement Walker told Insider that when you eat the same foods regularly, your digestive system gets used to them and \"can lead to better gut health overall.\"\nAccording to Walker, the experiment also had the benefit of potential weight loss or management because \"eating the same foods regularly makes it easier to control your portion sizes and calorie intake.\"\nBecause I don't track my weight or weigh myself, I can't confirm if I lost a few pounds , but I felt better over the two weeks than I did in a while. I didn't crave dessert as much, something I often did before, and I felt full every night.\nAdvertisement Overall, I enjoyed the experiment and would try it again I'm glad I experimented with eating the same meal for two weeks. Jen Glantz All in all, I thought the experiment gave me encouragement to eat more nutritionally balanced meals and cook at home. Though I wanted a little more variety with my dinners, I think my body felt better, and I loved how much time I saved at the grocery store and at home.\nI'll take a break from eating the pasta and salad meal for at least a month, but I want to try this experiment again with a different meal. That way, I can have two or three nutritious meals that I can switch back and forth from making each week.\nBut until then, I'll settle on ordering takeout one or two times a week.\nAdvertisement This story was originally published on January 10, 2023, and most recently updated on November 7, 2024.",

    "text": "Photo: JASON REDMOND / AFP / Getty Images\nBoeing machinists, numbering around 33,000, most of whom are based in Washington state, went on strike early Friday (September 13) after overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed contract . The strike, which began at 12:01 a.m. PDT, is expected to halt the production of the company's best-selling airline planes, including the 737 Max, the 777, and the 767 cargo plane. The strike will not affect the production of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by nonunion workers in South Carolina.\nThe proposed contract would have increased wages by 25% over four years , raising the average machinist's salary from $75,608 to $106,350. However, the deal fell short of the union's initial demand for pay raises of 40% over three years. The union also sought to restore traditional pensions that were axed a decade ago but settled for an increase in Boeing's contributions to employee 401(k) retirement accounts.\nThe rejected contract also included $3,000 lump sum payments and a reduced share of healthcare costs. Boeing had also agreed to build its next new plane in Washington state, meeting a key union demand.\nThe strike is a significant setback for Boeing , whose reputation and finances have been battered by manufacturing problems and multiple federal investigations this year. The company responded to the strike announcement by stating it was \"ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.\"",
