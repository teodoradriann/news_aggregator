    "text": "Cinco influencers são presos suspeitos de esquema que movimentou R$ 680 mi\nLer resumo da notícia\nA Polícia Civil da Bahia prendeu, hoje, 23 pessoas, entre os quais cinco influenciadores digitais, suspeitos de integrarem uma organização criminosa que lavava dinheiro por meio de rifas ilegais nas redes sociais. O grupo teria movimentado R$ 680 milhões, segundo as autoridades.\nO que aconteceu\nOs influenciadores presos são:\n- Ramhon Dias que soma 427 mil seguidores.\nEle já havia sido preso em setembro de 2024por suspeita de participação em esquema de lavagem de dinheiro do tráfico de drogas por meio de rifas ilegais. Ele foi solto ainda no ano passado e agora foi detido novamente. - Franklin Reis acumula 690 mil seguidores. Reis ganhou popularidade na internet com os personagens humorísticos Neka e Abias.\n- O casal de influencers José Roberto Santos e Gabriela Silva, que, juntos, somam mais de 250 mil seguidores. José Roberto, conhecido na internet como \"Nanam Premiações\", também foi preso na mesma operação que deteve Ramhon em 2024. Casal seria o chefe do esquema criminoso, segundo a PCBA.\n- Lázaro Andrade é um policial militar influencer com 169 mil seguidores. Ele, que é conhecido como Alexandre Tchaca, tem um podcast e tentou se eleger vereador em 2024, mas não foi eleito.\nAlém dos cinco influenciadores, também foram presos outros cinco policiais militares da Bahia. Mais três agentes tiveram o mandado de prisão expedido pela Justiça estadual, mas, segundo a Polícia Militar da Bahia, eles não foram localizados e são considerados foragidos. Os nomes dos PMs não foram revelados. Mais 10 pessoas foram detidas, porém não tiveram as identidades divulgadas.\nSplash não conseguiu contato com as defesas dos influenciadores. O espaço segue aberto para manifestação.\nEntenda como funcionava o esquema\nGrupo atuava principalmente por meio dos perfis desses influenciadores com milhares de seguidores. Segundo a Polícia Civil da Bahia, a organização criminosa atuava em Salvador e na região metropolitana da capital baiana.\nGrupo tinha método de atuação sofisticado, diz a investigação. Os suspeitos mantinham uma estrutura para realizar transações financeiras por meio de empresas de fachadas e usavam laranjas para disfarçar a origem do dinheiro obtido por vias ilícitas.\nPolicias da ativa e ex-militares ofereciam proteção aos criminosos. Os agentes são acusados de fornecerem informações privilegiadas aos comparsas, além de atuarem também como operadores das rifas ilegais.\nRifas oferecidas pelo grupo custavam centavos. Em troca, eles prometiam premiações de valores altos, além de itens como carros de luxo.\nPolícia afirma que os sorteios eram manipulados. De acordo com a investigação, os prêmios costumavam ser entregues a membros da própria organização, em uma tentativa de legitimar o esquema criminoso perante os seguidores.\nNa operação de hoje, foram apreendidos diversos itens dos suspeitos. Entre outros, a polícia apreendeu veículos de luxo, relógios, dinheiro, cartões bancários, celulares e notebooks. Justiça da Bahia também autorizou o sequestro de até R$ 10 milhões por CPF ou CNPJ investigado.\nVeja também\nDeixe seu comentário\nO autor da mensagem, e não o UOL, é o responsável pelo comentário.

    "text": "The Rajasthan government has suspended two school teachers for their alleged involvement in religious conversion and ties to banned terror outfits. The orders to suspend the school teachers were issued on Thursday night following directions from the education minister.The teachers, identified as Mirza Mujahid and Firoz Khan, were posted at a government-run school in Kota's Sangod block.Rajasthan education minister Madan Dilawar said that another teacher is also facing an investigation in this case.(Also Read: How a law has turned the tables on interfaith couples)The probe stems from allegations contained in the memorandum from Sarva Hindu Samaj, alleging ongoing activities related to religious conversion and \\\"love jihad\\\" – a conspiracy theory that Muslim men are luring Hindu women in a bid to convert them to Islam and ultimately gain demographic domination – since 2019.It was also alleged that the three teachers had connections with proscribed outfits and that they had links to Pakistani groups.The memorandum also stated that an FIR had previously been registered in this regard at Sangod police station, but no action was taken. It further claimed that a Hindu girl who was named as Muslim in the school record was abducted by Muslim youths and was yet to be traced.(Also Read: What is it like to be a Muslim in India?)In a video statement released on Friday, the state education minister said that strict action has been initiated against three teachers in a government senior secondary school at Khajuri Odpur village in Sangod.\\\"In the Khajoori village of Sangod panchayat samiti in Kota district, the religion of a girl in senior secondary school was mentioned as 'Islam' in the transfer certificate of a girl despite her being a Hindu. A conspiracy of religious conversion and 'love jihad' is happening there, Hindu girls are being forced to offer namaz - this has come to our notice,\\\" Dilawar said.To be sure, the Union home ministry informed the Parliament in 2020 that the term ‘Love Jihad’ is not defined under the extant laws.He further said that if the teachers are found to be involved in these acts, the three of them will be terminated from the job.\\\"As soon as this was brought to my notice, I decided to take strict action against three teachers. In this context, I suspended two teachers - Firoz Khan and Mirza Mujahideen. Further action is being taken against one Shabana. All three of them have been sent to Bikaner. I will take strict action against them after a detailed investigation. If needed, I will expel them,\\\" the minister added.",

    "text": "2 Ohio Cities Among The 'Worst Run Cities' In America By Sarah Tate\nJune 6, 2024\nPhoto: Photo by Mike Kline/Moment/Getty Images If you've ever traveled to another city, you likely noticed some differences , big or small, from where you live. Maybe the roads are a little smoother , or the traffic is more congested. Perhaps the crime rate is higher than you're used to or you feel safer walking down the street alone. A variety of factors influences the way cities are run, and some run better than others.\nEngineer Your Finances compiled a list of 21 \"worst run cities\" in America, basing its list on findings from WalletHub , that includes factors like high crime rates, financial stability, budget management, education and more. Among the list that includes cities like Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans are two right here in Ohio: Cleveland and Toledo.\nKeep reading to see what the site had to say about these two Buckeye State cities :\n\" Cleveland rocks, but besides the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, there's no reason to visit or living in the city. [...] Residents agree, with more people fleeing Cleveland every year. According to the 2020 census, the city was down to a population of only 320,000, losing 600,000 people over the past 70 years!\" \" Toledo , Ohio, has a lot in common with other mid-size cities throughout the Midwest; it was once booming, but now that factories have been shutting down and industries are moving overseas, it's a shell of what it once was. [...] There's little opportunity in Toledo, which is why the population is decreasing alarmingly. With no job prospects, people are leaving, bringing down the cities' income, which means less money for education, health, and safety.\" Check out the full list at engineeryourfinances.com to read up on the site's picks for the \"worst-run\" cities in the country.",

    "text": "Why Does Facebook Keep Closing?\nFacebook, one of the most popular social media platforms, has been experiencing a series of unexpected closings in recent years. Whether it’s due to technical issues, mass outages, or even alleged misinformation, Facebook’s reliability has come under scrutiny . But have you ever wondered what’s behind these mysterious closures? In this article, we’ll explore the reasons behind Facebook’s frequent shutting down, and what it means for the company and its users.\nThe Importance of Facebook\nBefore diving into the reasons behind Facebook’s closures, it’s essential to understand the significance of the platform. Facebook is the largest social media network globally, with over 2.7 billion monthly active users . The platform plays a crucial role in connecting people, fostering global conversations, and providing a space for online communities to form. In the age of digital communication, Facebook’s significance cannot be overstated.\nFacebook’s Closures: What Do We Know?\nFacebook’s closures are not new. The company has faced numerous outages, most of which are attributed to technical issues, such as server crashes, infrastructure maintenance, or even human error . These outages have a significant impact on users, as access to personal data, messages, and posts are compromised .\nSome notable instances of Facebook closures include:\nDate\nReason\nDuration\nAugust 2019\nTechnical issue\n2 hours\nMarch 2018\nServer maintenance\n3 hours\nJuly 2017\nAlgorithm glitch\n2 hours\nSeptember 2016\nSecurity breach\n16 hours\nThe Reasons Behind Facebook’s Closures\nSo, what causes Facebook’s frequent closures? Here are some significant factors:\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nTechnical Issues Massive User Base Security Concerns Maintenance and Updates Loss of Confidence Economic Consequences Privacy Concerns Competitor Advantage Technical Issues\nFacebook’s vast infrastructure, with millions of users, poses numerous technical challenges . As a result, the company faces:\n• Server crashes : With such a massive user base, it’s natural for servers to experience technical glitches, leading to outages.\n• Infrastructural maintenance : As Facebook’s infrastructure grows, regular maintenance becomes essential to prevent downtime.\n• Code errors : Human mistakes, known as \"bugs,\" can also lead to closures.\nMassive User Base\nFacebook’s enormous user base is another factor contributing to closures. As user numbers grow, so does the demand on the platform’s resources :\n• Increased traffic : When millions of users log in simultaneously, the platform’s capacity to handle traffic can be overwhelmed, causing slowdowns or outages.\n• Bandwidth issues : The more users, the more data is transmitted, placing an immense strain on Facebook’s servers.\nSecurity Concerns\nSecurity concerns are another significant reason for Facebook’s closures. The company faces ongoing challenges to protect user data and prevent malicious attacks :\n• Data breaches : Cyberattacks can compromise user data, leading to outages and system downtime.\n• Vulnerability exploitation : Exploits on vulnerabilities in Facebook’s code can grant attackers access to sensitive information, resulting in closures.\nMaintenance and Updates\nFacebook’s frequent closures may also be attributed to the company’s commitment to ongoing maintenance and updates:\n• Bug fixes : Regularly releasing updates to fix bugs and errors ensures the platform remains stable.\n• Software updates : Implementing new software, infrastructure, or algorithms can require scheduled downtime.\nThe Impact on Facebook and Its Users\nFacebook’s closures can have significant consequences for both the company and its users:\nLoss of Confidence\nRepeated closures can lead to a loss of trust among users, making them question Facebook’s reliability and credibility .\nEconomic Consequences\nClosures can also have significant financial implications for businesses and advertisers , who rely on Facebook’s advertising and data analytics capabilities.\nPrivacy Concerns\nWhen Facebook closes due to security breaches or data issues, it highlights concerns about user privacy and the potential misuse of sensitive information.\nCompetitor Advantage\nMeanwhile, competitors like Twitter, Instagram, and others capitalize on Facebook’s downtime , stealing the spotlight and attracting users who grow weary of the platform’s unreliability.\nConclusion\nFacebook’s frequent closures may seem like a nuisance to some, but they are a critical reality for the company. Technical issues, mass user base, security concerns, and maintenance updates are all contributing factors . It’s essential for Facebook to continue improving its infrastructure, security measures, and software to minimize downtime and maintain user trust.\nWhile Facebook’s closures may be inconvenient, it’s crucial to recognize the company’s ongoing efforts to provide a reliable platform for users worldwide. As Facebook continues to grow and adapt, it’s likely that the company will work to reduce the frequency and duration of outages .\nWhat are your thoughts on Facebook’s frequent closures?

Alok Kumar, ADGP for Traffic and Road Safety, said that the entire Bengaluru-Mysuru Road network, including the highway, Mysuru district and city, will become a fully-functional ITMS corridor.\nThe Intelligent Traffic Management System or ITMS was launched in Bengaluru in December 2022. As part of the system, 250 automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras and 80 red light violation detection (RLVD) cameras were installed at 50 junctions in the whole city.\nThese ANPR cameras under ITMS now have been installed on major Expressway roads in Mysuru at an estimated cost of Rs 8.5 crore – Rs 4 crore for Mysuru city and Rs 4.5 crore for Mysuru district region. Alok Kumar said that the process of challaning vehicle users for traffic violations will begin from July 1.\nAlok Kumar told the Deccan Herald that the cameras will cover several areas of Mysuru district such as Hunsur, HD Kote, Nanjangud and T Narasipur and now the Traffic Management Centre at Mysuru will start very soon.\nHe also proposed that ITMS cameras will be installed on four major highways connecting Bengaluru to nearby taluks and districts this year. The roads where the ITMS cameras will be installed include Tumakuru Road (NH 4), from Madanayakanahalli to Sira; Kanakapura Road (NH 948) till Kollegal, Hosur Road (NH 44).\nApart from the ITMS cameras, they are also planning to include Variable Messaging Signs (VMS) on these roads.\nInterestingly, these VMS will display digital messages about real-time traffic conditions or any temporary road events ahead to inform drivers on the stretch.\nApart from this, local police is also planning to install more cameras on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway to strengthen enforcement and fix VMS boards.\nAlok Kumar stated that the proposal has been approved by the state road transport authority and the tenders will be floated after a formal order is issued, which might happen in July.\nDuring a review meeting on June 1, the state police’s traffic and road safety wing discussed integrating the challan system with FASTag at toll gates to enable direct deduction of traffic fines from the FASTag wallet. Alok Kuamr said he plans to write to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for approval.\nAlong with installing cameras, the police are also planning to invest in signboards, blinkers, 800 alcometers for checking drunk driving, and 155 laser speed guns to enhance road safety across Karnataka, excluding Bengaluru.",

De acordo com o Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet), [ o temporal deve se estender até domingo (24) ](https://www.itatiaia.com.br/cidades/2024/03/22/chuva-extrema-no-rio-de-janeiro-pode-atingir-98-cidades-veja-quais)e a previsão é de que a situação seja mais crítica na Zona da Mata Mineira, na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo, e em todo o estado do Rio de Janeiro. Nessas regiões, a chuva deverá ser superior a 100 milímetros por dia com ventos podendo chegar a 100 km/h. No estado do Rio a previsão é que o acumulado de chuva seja ainda maior. Em áreas como a Baixada Fluminense, no litoral norte do estado e a Região Serrana, o volume de água poderá ficar de 300 a 500 mm até domingo, mais que o esperado para todo mês de março. Por conta do forte temporal, o [governador Cláudio Castro (PL) decretou ponto facultativo nesta sexta-feira (22)](https://www.itatiaia.com.br/brasil/2024/03/21/previsao-de-temporais-faz-rio-de-janeiro-decretar-ponto-facultativo-nesta-sexta-22), para evitar deslocamento da população e recomendou que os municípios façam o mesmo. “Acabei de decretar ponto facultativo. O Corpo de Bombeiros cancelou todas as folgas até domingo e isso da um quantitativo extra de 2 mil homens por dia. Os agentes do Segurança Presente da Lei Seca também estarão todos a disposição do socorro necessário. São quatro mil homens e mulheres, além da Polícia Militar e da Polícia Civil que estarão de prontidão. Queria fazer um apelo à população que não fique em área de risco. Os que puderem fiquem casa caso sua casa fique em lugar seguro.” O Tribunal de Justiça do Rio (TJ-RJ) e a Assembleia Legislativa do Rio (ALERJ), também suspenderam o expediente nesta sexta-feira. O mesmo foi feito por órgãos federais como o Ministério da Gestão e Inovação que disse que não haverá expediente nos órgãos e entidades federais localizados no Rio de Janeiro. Universidades do estado como a UERJ, UFRJ, UFF, UNIRIO e Universidade Federal Rural também cancelaram as atividades. Em suas redes sociais, o prefeito do Rio, Eduardo Paes (PSD), pediu que os cariocas fiquem em casa e que empresários, comerciantes e gestores, dispensem seus funcionários. Escolas e demais instituições de ensino da rede pública do município também vão suspender as aulas e a prefeitura solicitou que as instituições privadas façam o memso. “Os maiores riscos são de sexta pra sábado e de sábado pra domingo e por enquanto eles (meteorologistas) continuam com esse alerta” Quem mora em área de risco a orientação é procurar abrigo da Defesa Civil em caso de acionamento das sirenes.",

    "text": "CG writes: Developer Praydog has worked tirelessly to convert Capcom games to VR (some with full motion controls too) with his REFramework mod, and has been beavering away at an Unreal Engine VR mod for quite some time. What is interesting about this is the fact there are 1000s of Unreal Engine games to choose from which opens up the VR library considerably (best results with UE 4/5 games). Unlike people such as LukeRoss who unashamedly charge a premium for his AER Real VR mod where you have to keep paying more if any of the games become broken due to game updates, Praydog offers his efforts FREE-OF-CHARGE, which is why gamers should toss a donation his way via the Patreon page if they are able to. Here's a list of eight amazing indie merch sites that will allow you to find exactly what you are looking for, and probably a few more extras on top of that. A ghost from Cloud's past plays a larger role in the middle act of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. Don't be surprirsed if Zack ends up being a bad guy at some point over a misunderstanding after certain story events. Yoshinori Kitase, Tetsuya Nomura, and Naoki Hamaguchi are extremely excited about a certain encounter in Corel Prison.",

    "title": "Singapore's EV adoption rate nearly doubles in 2024, with one out of 3 cars sold from Jan-May being electric - paultan.org",
    "text": "Over in Singapore, electric vehicle (EV) take-up is on the rise, accounting for nearly one of every three new cars registered the republic in the first five months of this year. That’s nearly double the 2023 figure of 18.1%, as the Straits Times reports.\nThe latest available information from the land transport authority (LTA) revealed that out of the 14,802 new cars registered from January to May, a total of 4,819 units, or 32.6%, were EVs.\nThe number of electric cars in Singapore as of May stands at 16,738 units, or 2.6% of the total vehicle population, well up from the 6,531 units (or 1%) at the end of 2022, when EVs only accounted for 11.7% of total new car registrations.\nAccording to the country’s transport minister Chee Hong Tat, financial incentives for buying cleaner energy vehicles as well as a grant to support the installation of chargers in non-landed private residences and a law to ensure that chargers are safe and accessible are the primary reasons why EV adoption rates have increased significantly.\nIn terms of incentives, buyers of new EVs get up to SGD40,000 (RM139,500) in rebates, these being SGD15,000 (RM52,300) through the EV early adoption incentive and up to SGD25,000 (RM87,200) from the enhanced vehicular emissions scheme (VES).\nHe said the EV common charger grant, introduced in 2021 and available until the end of 2025, has co-funded the cost of putting 1,100 EV chargers in private condominiums so far. This is up from 789 chargers in November 2023, which was before the amendment to the law that lowers the threshold needed to pass resolutions to install EV chargers at strata-titled developments kicked in.\nAs such, Chee said that the installation of EV chargers is on track to support the growth in the EV population, with more than 7,100 charging points now available across the island state, including charging points in more than a third of housing and development board (HDB) car parks.\nThe ST report adds that adoption rates have climbed as a result of more models coming into the market, many of them qualifying for the cheaper Category A certificate of entitlement (COE) . However, as an academic points out, the numbers might not continue to double.\n“Singapore’s transition to EVs really started only in the past two years. The adoption rate will likely plateau, as it cannot be nearly doubling every year,” said Victor Kwan, a senior lecturer with the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\nLooking to sell your car?
