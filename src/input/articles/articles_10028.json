    "text": "A tradicional festa de Corpus Christi da Arquidiocese de Brasília reuniu cerca de 50 mil fiéis na Esplanada dos Ministérios, nesta quinta-feira (30). O evento contou com apoio de órgãos do Governo do Distrito Federal (GDF), incluindo interdição de vias para organização do trânsito e instalação de pontos de hidratação.\nA solenidade do Santíssimo Corpo e Sangue de Cristo começou às 6h, com a confecção de tapetes com imagens que relembram o sacramento da Eucaristia, até o grande ato: a Santa Missa, às 17h, celebrada pelo cardeal-arcebispo de Brasília, dom Paulo Cezar Costa. Por fim, às 19h, o público seguiu a procissão do Santíssimo Sacramento, em que o arcebispo proferiu bênçãos aos enfermos, aos governantes e às famílias.\nO secretário de Governo, José Humberto Pires de Araújo, destacou a importância do evento para a comunidade católica do DF. “É um evento histórico na nossa cidade que transcende, inclusive, a própria fé, porque muita gente vem curiosa para conhecer esse o momento bonito que é a celebração”, observou. “Temos um esquema de policiais, bloqueio do trânsito, muita organização. É uma festa tranquila, porque quem está aqui está carregando o Espírito de Deus no coração. As pessoas vêm para renovar a fé”, disse.\nA cerimônia ocorre na Esplanada dos Ministérios desde 1978 e faz parte da história brasiliense. A enfermeira Juliana Nonato, 31, e a dona de casa Alessandra Nonato, 22, frequentam o Corpus Christi desde crianças. As irmãs desejam passar a tradição aos filhos. “Nós os trazemos desde que são pequenos para que aprendam a valorizar nossa religião”, conta Juliana, que é mãe da Helena, 5, e do Joaquim, 1. “Minha mãe trazia a gente e nós ficávamos brincando enquanto a missa acontecia, mas sempre de olho, louvando a Deus. É isso que queremos transmitir a eles”, completa Alessandra, mãe do Bernardo, 5, e do Arthur, 1.\nA aposentada Lúcia Silveira, 74, acompanhou Juliana e Alessandra na celebração deste ano. Católica, Lúcia mora em Itaituba (MG), e aproveitou a visita à casa da filha, que reside em Samambaia, para conhecer a festa brasiliense. “Eu adorei! É tão bonito, tudo tão organizado, tem muitos policiais e não vi nenhum problema no trânsito. Nunca tinha visto um evento grande assim, cheio de gente unida com Deus. Vou tentar voltar outros anos”, compartilhou.\nEsta também foi a primeira vez do confeiteiro Everson Ribeiro, 40, no evento. Ele levou a esposa, a recepcionista Débora Amorim, 42, e os filhos Isabella, 12, e Arthur, 7, para aproveitarem o momento. “É tão grandioso quanto o que vemos na televisão, muito bonito”, disse Everson. Por sua vez, Débora já conhecia a festa, mas fazia alguns anos que não participava: “Vim a última vez há uns oito anos e estou muito feliz em voltar e ver que a festa continua linda. Quero plantar essa semente nos meus filhos, para que a gente volte mais vezes”, comentou.\nApoio\nO coordenador-geral do evento, Gabriel Oliveira Soares, destacou o esforço coletivo para a realização da festa. Segundo ele, cerca de 500 pessoas atuaram na parte pastoral, que diz respeito à liturgia. “A colaboração para a realização da festa é de extrema importância. Gostaria de agradecer a todos que vieram e nos ajudaram a fazer acontecer em mais um ano”, salientou.\nA Companhia de Saneamento Ambiental do Distrito Federal (Caesb) instalou pontos de distribuição de água ao longo do canteiro central da Esplanada dos Ministérios. Foram disponibilizados 2.600 litros de água e distribuídos 1.200 copos para as equipes que trabalharam no evento.\nO Departamento de Trânsito do Distrito Federal (Detran-DF) e a Polícia Militar do Distrito Federal (PMDF) fizeram interdições em vias da Esplanada dos Ministérios a partir das 23h59 de quarta-feira (29). Houve bloqueio de pistas próximas ao Museu da República, à Catedral, aos blocos A e B da Esplanada e ao Palácio Presidencial para garantir a segurança dos pedestres.\nO evento também contou com apoio da Unidade de Assuntos Religiosos do Distrito Federal, do Corpo de Bombeiros Militar do DF e da Secretaria de Proteção da Ordem Urbanística do DF.\nCom informações da Agência Brasília",

    "text": "- China experiences a spike in down jacket sales due to a cold wave, with high-end goose down jackets gaining popularity; Skypeople’s jacket sells for 7,000 yuan, and Bosideng’s hiking series averages over 6,000 yuan. - The market for goose down apparel surged, with sales representing 18% of total related apparel in 2022-2023, and the down jacket sector grew 34% year-on-year; the overall market reached 169.2 billion yuan in 2022. - Guvet leads the market with a 28% share in the 1,500-2,999 yuan range on Douyin and plans expansion with offline stores in partnership with Luxemporium, tapping into the trend of outdoor sports driving market growth. “` The down jacket market in China is experiencing a boom, particularly in the high-end segment, as consumers brace for the chilly weather. This surge is largely attributed to the increased spending power of Chinese consumers and their growing preference for quality and luxury in winter apparel. Price Surge in Domestic Down Clothing With the onset of winter, the demand for warm clothing has led to a spike in the prices of down jackets. A notable example is the domestic brand Skypeople, whose goose down jacket now retails for an astonishing 7,000 yuan ($979), triggering debates among netizens. Premium Brands Lead the Market Brands such as Bosideng are at the forefront of this upward trend. Their hiking series outerwear, for instance, has an average price point exceeding 6,000 yuan. Customers like Linda Yuan, who recently purchased a Bosideng down jacket for 2,800 yuan, are drawn to features such as the jacket’s lightness and quick warming capabilities. Increasing Market Share for Goose Down Jackets Goose down jackets have carved out a significant place in the market, now making up a larger percentage of total down jacket sales. This expansion reflects the rising disposable incomes and the ever-evolving tastes of Chinese consumers. - The proportion of goose down sales has jumped from 8 percent to 18 percent between 2022 and 2023. - Market growth is outpacing the general clothing industry, with the down jacket sector valued at approximately 169.2 billion yuan in 2022. Segment Growth and Market Dominance Interestingly, the sector’s growth is particularly strong in the higher-priced segments, with products over 800 yuan witnessing a 70 percent growth in sales, according to Douyin. Guvet is one brand that has capitalized on this trend, dominating sales on Douyin and planning an expansion into physical retail spaces. - Guvet leads with nearly 28 percent market share in the 1,500-2,999 yuan price range. - The brand’s Black Pearl series, priced above 2,000 yuan, tops the sales charts on Douyin. - Guvet also commands 18 percent of the market share in the 3,000 yuan price bracket. Targeting the Affluent and Plans for Expansion Guvet’s founder, Wu Kunming, states that their brand targets affluent women between the ages of 30 and 40, focusing on quality and service. With an increase in average purchase price and a loyal customer base, the brand has opened its inaugural offline pop-up store in Beijing and has plans for further expansion across China. Influence of Outdoor Sports and Competition The increased popularity of outdoor sports among the youth has also propelled the down jacket market forward, with a staggering year-on-year sales increase reported in the first three quarters. Despite facing stiff competition from international luxury brands, sportswear labels, and fast fashion outlets, domestic down jacket manufacturers are holding their ground. Changing Consumer Preferences Today’s younger Chinese consumers are well-informed and culturally savvy. They are moving away from a focus on price alone, seeking out products that offer quality and value. Wu emphasizes that in a competitive market like China’s, focusing on the product, values, and the consumer experience is key to success.",

    "text": "SARA ALZAABI (ABU DHABI)\nIn the UAE, the elderly are referred to as ‘senior citizens’ — a term that reflects the country’s deep respect for those who are regarded as pillars of wisdom, experience, and cultural heritage.\nSeniors remain at the heart of the country’s development, with their rights and wellbeing protected as part of the UAE Centennial Plan 2071. An integrated system of initiatives ensure that those above the age of 60 receive the care, support, and recognition that they deserve.\nThe newly launched Barakatna initiative reaffirms a national mission to prioritise holistic care for seniors. Beyond providing the essentials, the programme empowers the elderly, upholds their privacy and independence, guarantees their access to services and information, and bolsters their connections with their families.\nBarakatna strengthens the UAE’s long-held commitment to making sure seniors lead a dignified life. The National Policy for Senior Emiratis, introduced in 2018, encompasses all such efforts with its seven pillars: healthcare, civic participation, community life, infrastructure, financial stability, safety, and future wellbeing. Federal Law No. 9 of 2019 strengthens this policy, ensuring the rights of seniors to housing, education, employment, and protection from abuse.\nA slew of initiatives for seniors were rolled out over the years.\nClinics on wheels provided free consultations. Trainings were held for caregivers. Internet literacy projects, which have so far reached over 63,000, help seniors keep up with a digitised world.\nCommunity engagement is encouraged through various activities while civic participation is supported through mentorship opportunities for retired professionals.\nInfrastructural enhancements and transportation have made public services more accessible, providing discounts and free taxi services for Emiratis over the age of 60.\nThe UAE cares for the wellbeing of its senior citizens through safety hotlines, training, and support, including community shelters and cultural programmes initiated by the Ministry of Community Development.\nPromoting a sense of belonging, certain initiatives connect seniors with the community, especially during the pandemic. When Covid-19 hit, the ‘We Are Your Family’ initiative linked up volunteers with over 14,000 seniors to alleviate the impact of isolation.\nSeveral projects — like \"Barakat Al Dar\" programme, mobile services from Al Ain City Municipality, and Abu Dhabi Police “Hope Planter Initiative”— ensure the needs of the elderly are catered to right in their homes.\nPop-up clinics organised by the Ministry of Health and Emirates Health Services have provided better healthcare access to those who live far from the cities, while big hospitals in Abu Dhabi offered a variety of home and long-term care services to senior citizens without families.\nDigital services have also better been equipped with elder-suitable features, such as grand text and screen readers.\nMoreover, taxi discounts in Abu Dhabi, free bus rides, and parking benefits in Dubai have made transport much easier for them.\nAllowances are provided to those who need them most, while various sponsorships are granted, from the Emirates Red Crescent’s initiatives to the Zayed Foundation-funded Hajj trips.\nEducation and work, with the approval of the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, are still open to retirees, while those who are vulnerable get assistance through the Zakat Fund.\nAll these efforts have created a profound impact: Senior Emiratis are among the happiest in the world — and the happiest group in the country, according to a 2024 report.",

Environment Canada says [coastal areas from around Bella Bella south to around Sayward](https://weather.gc.ca/?layers=alert&zoom=6¢er=51.83357984,-127.08329274) on Vancouver Island including Port Hardy and Port McNeill may see [power outages](https://www.bchydro.com/power-outages/app/outage-list.html) and fallen tree branches because of the high winds. A previous wind advisory on Wednesday warned of gusts up to 120 kilometres an hour along exposed areas of B.C.'s southern and central coasts. The winds earlier in the week knocked out power to more than 1,000 BC Hydro customers on Cortes Island, along with thousands of others on Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and the mainland, while a Christmas Day storm [halted ferry service and led to some road closures](https://www.timescolonist.com/local-news/christmas-day-storm-knocks-out-ferries-and-power-disrupting-holiday-plans-8025052) on Vancouver Island.
