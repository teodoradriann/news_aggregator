    "text": "Politico investigative reporter Heidi Przybyla said Thursday on MSNBC’s “All In” that Christian nationalists, not Christians, believe rights come from God.\nPrzybyla said, “The base of the Republican Party has shifted. Remember when Trump ran in 2016, a lot of the mainland Evangelicals wanted nothing to do with the divorced real estate mogul who cheated on his wife with a porn star, and all of that. So what happened was that he was surrounded by this more extremist element. We are going to hear words like Christian Nationalism, like the new re-formation. These are groups that you should get very schooled on because they have a lot of power in Trump’s circle, the one thing that unites all of them, because there’s many different groups orbiting Trump, but the thing that unites them as Christian nationalists — not Christians, by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different — is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority. They don’t come from Congress. They don’t come to the Supreme Court, they come from God.”\nShe continued, “The problem with that is that they are determining men — it is men — are determining what God is telling them. And in the past, that so-called natural law is, you know, it’s a pillar of Catholicism for instance, it’s been used for good in social justice campaigns. Martin Luther King evoked it in talking about civil rights.”\nPrzybyla added, “But now, you have an extremist element of conservative Christians who say that this applies specifically to issues including abortion, gay marriage, and it’s going much further than that as you see, for instance, with the ruling in Alabama this week that judges connected to that Dominionist faction and talking about a lot of other issues, including surrogacy, IVF, you know, sex education in schools. There’s a lot in addition.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nClips Faith Media Christianity Heidi Pryzbyla Michael Steele MSNBC Politico",

    "text": "Confederate monuments have come down in Orlando, Tampa and most recently Jacksonville as part of a nationwide reckoning with public memorials that commemorate the Confederacy.\nBut if a bill becomes law next year, local leaders could be fined and even booted from office if they remove those monuments.\nState Rep. Dean Black, R-Jacksonville, is pushing the measure to protect monuments, including memorials to the Confederacy, and punish local officials who remove them. He said his bill is retroactive and seeks to restore monuments removed by local governments after Jan. 1, 2017.\n“It is history, and history belongs to all Floridians,” Black said. “We have started tearing down statues and memorials for all sorts of things. This is cancel culture. What we are trying to do is right the wrongs of cancel culture as they have been expressed against our public art.”\nBut state Rep. Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville, said Confederate memorials were erected to “scare and intimidate the Black community post-slavery,” and local elected leaders and their constituents should decide whether the monuments remain standing.\n“It is a horrible bill,” Nixon said. “It is meant to throw red meat at a base of voters at a time when they know it is an election year.”\nNixon added about the Confederate memorials: “We should not be uplifting losers who wanted to keep my people enslaved.”\nThe proposal ( HB 395 ), filed in November, prohibits local governments from removing monuments or memorials. Violators would be fined $5,000 or the cost of replacing the monument, whichever is higher. Elected officials who defy the state law could be removed from office by the governor.\nContextual plaques could be added if the director of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, state historic preservation officer and the Florida Historical Commission decide they provide “a more accurate understanding of the monument or memorial.” Monuments could also be temporarily moved for construction but must be returned to their original location or “as close as possible to the original location in a prominent place.”\n“It is the intent of the Legislature that the state not allow a historical monument or memorial to be removed, damaged, or destroyed,” the bill states. “Accurate history belongs to all Floridians in perpetuity.”\nThe bill doesn’t specifically reference the Confederacy, but it protects memorials for “any armed conflict since settlers from other countries came to what is now the United States.”\nAfter years of debate, Jacksonville Democratic Mayor Donna Deegan ordered the removal of the “Tribute to the Women of the Southern Confederacy” monument, which had stood in the city’s Springfield Park since 1915. Crews took down the memorial early Wednesday.\n“Symbols matter. They tell the world what we stand for and what we aspire to be,” Deegan said in a statement. “By removing the confederate monument from Springfield Park, we signal a belief in our shared humanity.”\nGet insights into Florida politics Subscribe to our free Buzz newsletter\nWe’ll send you a rundown on local, state and national politics coverage every Thursday.

The 9-ton monument topped with a concrete solider known as “Johnny Reb” was erected in 1911 on Main Street — now Magnolia Avenue — before being moved in 1917 to the park.\nElsewhere in Florida, Confederate memorials in Gainesville and Tampa were moved from courthouse grounds to cemeteries. In 2020, former Republican Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry ordered the removal of a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier that stood for more than a century in the city’s downtown.\nThe Florida Legislature has also voted in recent years to remove symbols of the state’s Confederate past. In 2015, the Senate agreed to strip the Confederate battle flag from its seal. Lawmakers voted to replace a statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall with one of civil rights Mary McLeod Bethune.\nBethune’s statue was unveiled in 2022, making history as the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue in Statutory Hall. Every state is represented by two statues.\nBlack’s bill includes a provision requiring state authorities to make the statue of Kirby Smith available first to Bob Grenier for free to display in Lake County. Grenier, former volunteer curator of the Lake County Historical Museum, pushed a plan to put the relic on display in the first-floor museum of the Historic Courthouse in Tavares.\nIf a suitable site in Lake County isn’t found by July 1, 2025, the state would find an alternative location to display the statue for free, according to the bill. The Confederate commander was born in St. Augustine, but otherwise spent little time in the state.\nGov. Ron DeSantis has been mum on whether he would sign the bill protecting monuments. In November, he told reporters he wasn’t familiar with the measure and would need to review it. A similar bill failed to gain traction in the 2023 legislative session.\nThe removal of the Jacksonville monument wasn’t the only time this week that the Civil War made headlines 158 years after the fact. DeSantis’ presidential campaign was sharply critical of his GOP opponent, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, for not mentioning slavery when asked Thursday about the cause of the war.\nAs of January 2022, Florida had 77 Confederate memorials, according to The Southern Poverty Law Center’s “Whose Heritage?” project. Thirty-three have been removed since 1880, according to the report.\nLawmakers will start their 60-day legislative session on Jan. 9.",

(EUROPA PRESS) - Los Estados miembro de la Unión Europea brindan protección temporal a 4,3 millones de ucranianos refugiados de la guerra, a fecha de enero de 2024, manteniéndose las cifras con respecto al pasado año, según revelan los últimos datos ofrecidos por la Oficina europea de Estadística (Eurostat). Los 27 acordaron activar por primera vez en la historia de la UE el mecanismo de protección temporal en respuesta a la invasión lanzada por el Kremlin. El instrumento garantiza la entrada legal a la Unión con permiso de residencia, acceso al mercado laboral y a la vivienda, la asistencia médica y el acceso a la educación de los niños. Los datos de Eurostat reflejan que los países de la UE que acogen a más ucranianos son Alemania, 29,5%, del total, y Polonia, 22,1%. Mientras que por detrás se sitúa República Checa, con el 8,9% de los desplazados por la guerra provocada por Rusia en 2022. En el caso de España, el país acoge a casi 200.000 ucranianos y es uno de los Estados miembros que experimenta un incremento mayor en beneficiarios de la protección temporal con respecto a finales de 2023, con 2.830 personas más, lo que supone un 1,5% de aumento. Respecto a su porcentaje de población, los Estados miembro de la UE que cobijan a más ucranianos que huyen de la guerra son República Checa, con 35,2 por cada 1000 habitantes, seguida de Bulgaria, 26,7, Lituania, 26,4, Estonia, 26,2, y Polonia, 25,9, mientras que la media europea se sitúa en 9,6 por cada millar de habitantes.",
