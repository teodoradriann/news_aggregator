    "text": "Owing to good rainfall in the catchment areas of the Tungabhadra and the resultant inflow of around 84,000 cusecs into the Tungabhadra Reservoir near Hosapete in Vijayanagara district, the authorities concerned on Sunday raised the crest gates of the dam to discharge excess water into the river course.\nAs per information provided by the Tungabhadra Reservoir authorities, the spillway discharge was increased to around 71,000 cusecs by raising 20 crest gates in addition to the 11,000 cusecs of water flowing into different irrigation canals.\nThe dam authorities on Saturday raised 18 crest gates to maintain an average outflow of 49,966 cusecs, including the canal discharge.\nConsidering the increased inflow into the dam on Sunday, they decided to raise two more gates to maintain discharge at around 82,000 cusecs.\nThe dam authorities, meanwhile, alerted people downstream to be cautious as the spillway discharge may cross 1,00,000 cusecs considering the rainfall in the Tungabhadra catchment area.\nThe information gathered from different sources showed that the Tungabhadra catchment area received good rainfall in the last two days. Water is being supplied to different canals, especially the Left Bank Low-level Main Canal, which alone irrigates over six lakh acres of land in Koppal and Raichur districts.\nWater storage in the reservoir is expected to be sufficient for two crops in the command area.\nPublished - October 13, 2024 10:23 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "A serious bullying incident at a school in Vöcklabruck is leading to police investigations against the alleged perpetrators and likely to school expulsions. According to a media report, a 15-year-old was harassed, beaten, strangled, and filmed by five 20-year-old classmates over several months. Once, he was even pushed against a window and fell two meters down. The \"Krone\" refers to an anonymous source. Police and the education directorate are withholding details but confirm that an incident occurred. A spokeswoman for the Upper Austrian education directorate informed that the alleged perpetrators have been suspended. On Thursday, a conference will be held at the school to decide on the expulsion. The school immediately reported the allegations to the police as soon as they became known, she emphasized.\nThe police confirmed upon APA request that investigations are ongoing. However, they did not want to provide any details for the time being. The education directorate also asked for understanding that no further information on the matter could be provided due to the ongoing investigation.\n(APA/Red.)\nThis article has been automatically translated, read the original article here .",
