    "text": "'Another Body' documentary exposes harm of deepfake tech By [ Kina Viola ](mailto:cunews@cornell.edu) Deepfake technology – the use of deep-learning artificial intelligence to create fake content online – creates a troubling portrait of consent in the digital age. A 2019 report by Sensity, a company that detects and monitors sexual deepfakes, found that 95% of all online deepfake videos are nonconsensual porn and 90% of those featured women. The Milstein Program in the College of Arts and Sciences, partnering with Cornell Cinema, will present [a free screening of the documentary “Another Body,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs3Wlf9BcEI) which focuses on the gendered implications of deepfake technology. The screening will be on Wednesday, February 7, at 7 p.m. at Cornell Cinema. This event is part of the [Science on Screens](https://scienceonscreen.org/) initiative, and will feature an introduction by Gili Vidan, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, as well as a post-show Q&A with one of the film’s directors. “Another Body” follows a college student's search for answers and justice after she discovers that the image of her face has been used without her consent in deepfake pornography. \"As deepfakes become increasingly commonplace, the film provides a look at the culture of the people behind them and asks why they do it. The answer is disturbing,\" says Milstein Program director [Austin Bunn](https://pma.cornell.edu/austin-bunn), associate professor of performing & media arts.

    "text": "\"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.\" — William Butler Yeats\nAt the inaugural National Retreat for Public University Councils in Mombasa, Higher Education PS Beatrice Inyangala called on public universities to operate like business firms.\nNational Assembly Education Committee chairperson Julius Melly echoed her sentiments, urging councils to become revenue-generating machines. President Ruto’s economic adviser Moses Kuria went further, declaring: “If a vice chancellor can’t run a university like Safaricom, they don’t belong in that role.”\nThis rhetoric reflects a dangerous ideological drift – one that seeks to fix the rot in higher education through corporate logic. It is a flawed prescription. A VC is not a CEO. A university is not a business. And education is not a commodity.\nThe purpose of a university is not to maximise profit, but to nurture critical thought, drive innovation and build a humane and inclusive society. Its success is measured not by revenue, but by the quality of its graduates, research output and public service. When the government urges institutions to adopt enterprise models, it ignores the real causes of our current crisis.\nOver the last decade, public funding for universities has collapsed. Government capitation per student, once covering up to 80 per cent of costs, now hovers below 40 per cent. Institutions were told to fill the gap through self-sponsored (module II) programmes. That temporary solution failed when KCSE performance dropped and university admissions changed. The house of cards fell.\n“The market can be a tool,” Tanzanian scholar Issa Shivji warned, “but it must never be mistaken for a compass.”\nMore troubling is the politicisation\nof university leadership. VCs are appointed not through merit but political\npatronage or ethnic arithmetic. Councils, too, have become reward posts for\nloyalists. These are not governance challenges – they are governance failures.\nBlaming universities for inefficiency without naming the political system that\nengineered it is dishonest.\nUniversities are drowning in debt because they’ve been forced to operate in a neoliberal vacuum, where public goods are expected to sustain themselves without public investment. That’s not reform. That’s neglect. Higher education, like healthcare, is a public good. It enables citizenship, equity and national development. Shifting the burden onto institutions while stripping them of resources is a contradiction.\nProfit-first thinking is also corrosive to the academic mission. Universities begin to commercialise programmes, favouring courses like business or IT that are easier to market, while abandoning disciplines like history, education, or philosophy – subjects essential for nurturing a reflective, democratic citizenry. Research shifts from basic inquiry to short-term consultancy. Admissions become transactional. Education is reduced to a market transaction, not a public responsibility.\n“The function of education,” wrote Dr Martin Luther King Jr, “is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of true education.” That goal is being replaced by monetised metrics.\nMorale within public universities is at an all-time low. Lecturers are overworked and underpaid. Support staff are being retrenched. Core services are outsourced in the name of “efficiency.” Meanwhile, a quiet but steady brain drain is under way. Scholars are leaving for better-funded institutions abroad or the private sector. You cannot build a world-class system while devaluing its core asset: its people.\nYes, universities need reform. But not by following Safaricom’s playbook. What they need is a restoration of purpose, independence and stable funding.\nWe must reinstate predictable government financing that reflects the role of higher education in national development. University leadership must be depoliticised, with VCs and council members appointed through open, merit-based and independent processes. Revenue diversification is necessary – but it must be context-sensitive and mission-aligned. Alumni endowments, public-private research collaborations and international partnerships are more sustainable than haphazard commercialisation.\nAcademic freedom and institutional autonomy must be safeguarded. And accountability systems must shift focus – from profitability and enrolment numbers to learning outcomes, knowledge production and societal contribution. This isn’t idealism. It is the only viable path to recovery.\nAs the African proverb cautions: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Corporate speed cannot fix structural erosion. Civic solidarity can.\nLet us stop pretending that universities can become factories. Safaricom sells airtime. Universities give something far more valuable: the ability to think, to challenge, to innovate, to serve. To treat them as enterprises is not only unwise—it is self-defeating.\nIf we are serious about rescuing higher education, we must start by treating universities as the cornerstones of an enlightened republic, not as struggling enterprises to be bailed out or privatised. Anything else is not reform. It is surrender.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — Actor Pierce Brosnan was cited for allegedly trespassing in forbidden areas of Yellowstone National Park near the thermal areas where the park's hot springs, geysers and mudpots sit.\nCourt documents show Brosnan was cited on Nov. 1 for \"foot travel in a thermal area\" at the park. He was also issued a closure violation for Mammoth Terraces — an area in the national park where numerous tiny, shallow pools sit on ledges of many different levels.\nThe closure violation simply alleges that the actor was in a restricted area, while the more specific foot travel violation indicates he is accused of entering a site with potentially dangerous water features.\nCourt documents show Brosnan must appear in court on Jan. 23 on the charges. Getting too close to the geysers at Yellowstone can result in punishments of thousands of dollars in fees or months in jail.\nBut fines and jail sentences aren't the only danger for leaving the trails in Yellowstone. The park's website points out that the thermal features found around the area are potentially deadly, and people have been seriously injured or killed by falling into them.\n\"In thermal areas, the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs, and there is no way to guess where a safe path is,\" the park's website says. \"New hazards can bubble up overnight, and pools are acidic enough to burn through boots, so you must stay in designated walking areas.\"\nAround the Yellowstone geysers, the park service has erected boardwalks to keep tourists safe.\nThe Mammoth Hot Springs, which are nestled in the Mammoth Terraces — where Brosnan is alleged to have gone — have largely decreased in activity in recent years, with many pools dried up. There are multiple walking and hiking paths through the terraces, and it's unclear where along those paths Brosnan allegedly disembarked for the restricted area.\nBrosnan is an Irish actor best known for his role in numerous films as the classic spy, James Bond. Brosnan played 007 in \"GoldenEye,\" \"Tomorrow Never Dies,\" \"The World is Not Enough,\" and \"Die Another Day\" between 1995 and 2002.\nHe also played Sam Carmichael in \"Mama Mia!\" in 2008.",

    "text": "„Unsere Erde“-Projekt\nVernissage an der Federsee-Grundschule\nAlleshausen / Lesedauer: 3 min\nIn einer kleinen Feierstunde in der Federseehalle durfte Schulleiterin Sandra Steidinger viele Gäste begrüßen und das Projekt vorstellen.\nDen Auftakt machte zunächst der Gesamtchor der Schule mit einem afrikanischen Willkommenslied und die Flötengruppe. Spätere Auftritte der Musiker sollten folgen. In vielen Schulfächern und allen Klassen wurde das Thema „Unsere Erde“ vorab ausgiebig behandelt. Jeder einzelne der etwa 100 Schüler war wichtig, um das Gemälde mit dem Namen „Unsere Erde“ zu erschaffen. Wobei Gemälde eigentlich nicht ganz die richtige Bezeichnung ist. Jeder der 100 Schüler hat ein Blatt mit seiner Schrift zu einem bestimmten Thema eng beschrieben und trug so mit seinem individuellen Teil zur Entstehung des Kunstwerks bei. Durch die Beschriftung mit dicken und dünnen schwarzen Filzstiften konnten am Ende dann die Einzelseiten zu einem Gesamtmotiv zusammen gesetzt werden.\nAls Motiv war die Weltkugel mit dem Schullogo ausgesucht. Jede Klasse hatte ein anderes Thema zum Schreiben. Klasse 2 hatte sich mit dem Thema „Ich in dieser Welt“ und dem Weltall beschäftigt. Klasse 3 und 4 fragte sich, was Heimat überhaupt bedeutet und weiter mit dem Ort, in dem wir leben. Von Alleshausen über Europa zu den Kontinenten. Die fertig beschriebenen Blätter wurden dann in die Werkstatt des Ateliers Saxa geschickt und dort zu einer zwei mal zwei Meter großen Montage zusammen montiert und auf Leinwand ausgedruckt. Mit Abstand betrachtet zeigt sich die Weltkugel gut zu erkennen, und je näher man vor dem Bild steht, wird der Text dahinter erkennbar.\nSandra Steidinger dankte allen, die zum Gelingen beigetragen haben, ob dem Lehrkörper oder die vielen Sponsoren und natürlich dem Förderverein ohne dessen Engagement so ein Projekt nicht durchführbar wäre. Bürgermeister Patrick Hepp meinte, dass die Federsee-Grundschule mit ihrem Angebot und Engagement ein Leuchtturm in der Regionsei, der seinesgleichen suche. Das zeige die Qualität des Projektes und die Aufmachung der heutigen Vernissage. Es sei bemerkenswert, wie die Federsee-Grundschule ihrem Bildungsauftrag nachkomme. Alleine schon die Komplexität des Themas „Von der Heimat in die Welt; von der Welt in die Heimat“ zeige, wie gut die Einrichtung ihre Schüler auf das weitere Leben vorbereitet. Denn die Vernetzung der Welt sei präsenter denn je. Das Ergebnis sei großartig. Die individuellen Bausteine der Schülerinnen und Schüler unterstreichen unser aller Individualität. Eingebettet in die Welt und das Schilfmotiv, das unsere Heimat beschreibt, werde einmal mehr deutlich, dass wir selbst in Summe das Heimat- und Weltbild darstellen und prägen. Damit kann und dürfe das geschaffene Werk ein tägliches Mahnmal sein, das daran erinnert, dass wir ein Teil des Ganzen sind und im Miteinander der Schlüssel liege. Zusammenfassend zeige sich, dass diese Projekt auf eine wunderbare Weise ein bedeutendes Thema unserer Zeit bearbeitet hat und sprach ein Kompliment an alle Beteiligten aus. Fünf Schüler durften danach das Kunstwerk enthüllen, wonach Beifall aufbrandete.",
