    "text": "During Friday's inauguration ceremony, broadcast by his office, he emphasized the importance of water as a vital resource for daily life and agricultural success. Jokowi noted that agricultural production, including rice, has declined globally, potentially leading to famine for 500 million people. \"Water has become an essential commodity,\" he pointed out. The dam, whose construction began in 2017, was completed in nearly seven years. Built at a cost of Rp1.6 trillion (US$95 million), it has a capacity of 82 million cubic meters and an area of inundation reaching 460 hectares. \"This is a large and expensive dam,\" he said. Jokowi explained that rainwater collected through the dam will provide local people with irrigation water, electricity, and flood control. \"The primary function is irrigation, supplying water for rice fields in Takalar and surrounding areas,\" he added. To further boost agricultural productivity in South Sulawesi, the government has distributed 80 water pumps to Bantaeng district, part of a national program aiming to distribute 20,000 pumps. These pumps are expected to support rice field irrigation and agricultural activities, mitigating the drought predicted for July to October.

    "title": "Chamber of Commerce sues to block FTC's noncompete ban",
    "text": "Chamber of Commerce sues to block FTC's noncompete ban Business groups led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Federal Trade Commission Wednesday seeking to block [a rule finalized this week that would outlaw noncompete provisions](https://www.abajournal.com/syndicated/article/ftc-bans-contracts-that-keep-workers-from-jumping-to-rival-employers) that prohibit workers from switching jobs within an industry. In a complaint filed in Texas federal court, the nation’s largest business lobby argued that the antitrust and consumer protection agency lacks the authority to issue rules that define unfair methods of competition. The FTC Act, which established the agency, allows it to bring cases challenging particular practices, the group said, but not to write rules. The Chamber was joined by Business Roundtable and several Texas business groups in challenging the rule. “The Commission’s categorical ban on virtually all noncompetes amounts to a vast overhaul of the national economy,” the Chamber said in the complaint. The rule “reflects an unlawful and unprecedented exercise of bureaucratic power.” The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to issue a final rule banning noncompetes in nearly all cases. The agency’s two Republicans dissented, adopting arguments similar to the business group that the FTC lacks clear congressional authority to write rules. Democrats argued that the law explicitly allows the FTC prohibit unfair methods of competition while another provision authorizes the agency “to make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of” the law. Taken together, those provisions permit the FTC to issue rules defining unfair conduct, they say, citing a 1973 case that upheld the agency’s rulemaking authority.",

    "text": "“We are collecting a very unique data set crucial to understanding climate change at a unique environment like this. What happens up here is eventually gonna trickle down to the valley.” –Observer Charlie Peachey\nWe’ve often heard that the summit of New Hampshire’s Mount Washington has the “worst weather on earth” so whats it like to live there? Check out this piece by\nNews Center Maine as they join the folks at the Mount Washington Observatory to get an idea of what the job entails.\nObservers work 8 days with 12 hour shifts on at the highest point in the Northeast and then get 6 days off. While on the clock they monitor data, educate the public and diligently go outside every hour to take measurements often using analog tools as they are more reliable than electronic alternatives.\nThe conditions are extreme but when indoors observers have a relatively comfortable existence with hearty meals, streaming services and resident cat named Nimbus that oversees operations (Nimbus is believed to the 18th such feline employee).\nShoutout to the observers at Mount Washington and all the weather professionals across the country and the earth who work hard everyday to provide us best possible information. We appreciate you!!!",
