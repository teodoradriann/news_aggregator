    "text": "You have to love American political parties’ national conventions, held every four years to nominate their choice for president and vice president. They’re a riot.\nAnd it’s not just the kitschy ambience, defined as it is by the funny hats, the colourful balloons, the idiosyncratic signs, the canned speeches and, my, all that confetti — lending to otherwise historic moments the air of infomercials — that earns them the moniker. There are times in fact when these conventions become a riot in both senses of the word, as old geezers like this columnist will tell you was the fate in 1968 of the Democratic National Convention.\nNot this time around though.\nThis year the DNC gathered on Monday night to anoint Kamala Harris as its candidate for a historic presidency and in effect to deny Donald Trump his much-hoped-for matchup against the hollowed-out Joe Biden, who in a valedictory speech that night addressed delegates relieved that he had finally agreed — only under pressure from party leaders and after unprecedented intraparty upheaval — to “pass the torch”, a speech in which he proudly mapped his legacy, claimed that “I gave my best” to the country and bade his fellow-Americans an emotional farewell.\nRead more by Fawaz Turki Race riots in Britain: Fear, hatred, and battle for social justice Stakes high for Kamala Harris in 2024 US elections Gaza war reveals limits of military power “Stop Arming Israel” It was sad — and for some, heartbreaking — to watch this well-meaning, octogenarian but flawed chief executive give his swan song before he disappeared into the nether world inhabited by former presidents. But that didn’t stop several DNC delegates, a few minutes after he took to the podium, from unfurling a banner in the colours of the Palestinian flag that read, “Stop Arming Israel”.\nThe delegates’ aim, they later told reporters, was to confront their fellow-conventioneers with what they and their party were trying to ignore that night: The ongoing genocide in Gaza, funded by their tax money and enabled by their President.\nAnd, yes, let’s face it, for Joe Biden there was a single issue on which he was resolute, on which he entertained no entreaties, no counter arguments and no cri de coeurs from many, many members of his party (and reportedly even his wife): Support for Israel’s war in Gaza. On that issue, the man just moved full steam ahead, no matter where the path took him — which ended up being genocide.\nPerhaps in that nether world, Joe Biden will have time to reflect and then reflect some more on the horrors that he had allowed the Zionist state to wreak on the defenceless people of this little, tormented strip of land.\nMeanwhile back to the four-day Democratic National Convention, which was held at the United Center — home to the Chicago Cubs — in Chicago. And where else but Chicago?\nSomething about Chicago’s DNA “I give you Chicago”, wrote famed journalist, cultural critic and satirist H.L. Mencken (d. 1956). “It is not London and Harvard. It is not Paris and buttermilk. It is American in every chitlin and spare rib. It is alive from snout to tail”.\nIn short, Chicago is, like turkey pardoning, corporate greed and denial on matters of race, as American as apple pie. That may or may not be why the Windy City has, since Abraham Lincoln accepted his party’s nomination in 1860, hosted more political conventions than any other in the country — 14 Republican and 12 Democratic.\nThere’s something about Chicago’s DNA (“I’m from Chicago. I don’t break” once declaimed by Barack Obama) that seems to light the fire in protesters’ blood. Sure, the anger felt by the tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters against President Joe Biden’s war in Gaza, in our time, is as visceral and vehement as that felt by the roughly 10,000 protesters against President Lyndon Johnson’s war in Vietnam in 1968, but expressions of this anger panned out differently.\nThe chaos visited upon the city 56 years ago, which was mostly the result of a “police riot” — as a government report later dubbed the unrestrained violence used by the men in blue, who had wrestled to the ground and beat bloody not only demonstrators but journalists and passers-by as well — still haunts those who were there, done that, and had their say, as it were, and today are pushing or have already pushed eighty.\nBy comparison, the protesters this year (who like their counterparts in 1968 espoused the slogan “The streets belong to the people”) marched, as of this writing on Tuesday, the second day of the convention, sans confrontations with the police, save for a few minor, isolated skirmishes.\nTo claim that you “were there, done that” and “had your say” matters in our time, in a world where we know that we are complicit in that which leaves us indifferent.\nLook, just a stone’s throw away from United Center is the Chicago History Museum, which has on view a permanent exhibit of protest art from the late 1960s and early ‘70s, including the art inspired by the soixante huitards of Chicago in 1968. Charles Bathea, the museum director, told WBEZ Chicago on Monday that the pro-Palestinian protests in his city, along with those that erupted on campuses nationwide in April, made the message of the exhibit more relevant.\n“I’m hoping that visitors will walk away [from the exhibit] with an understanding of people in the 1960s and 70s, those people who were willing to put their lives, their futures on the line for the issues they believed in”, he said. “I’m hoping also they’ll walk away with the feeling that it is necessary to continue carrying the torch forward, because we still have a long way to go”.\nWe hear you, brother.\n— Fawaz Turki is a noted academic, journalist and author based in Washington DC.

    "text": "12 Face Moisturizers, Creams, and Oils Approved by the National Eczema Association\nStocksy/ Guille Faingold Explore the SHOP\nIf you have\neczema, you have to be very careful about which products you put on your face. Luckily, the National Eczema Association (NEA) has a full directory of products they’ve given the eczema-safe Seal of Acceptance. The list contains a wide variety of recommended face moisturizers, creams, and oils at different price points. Best of all, they're chock full of ingredients that are safe and beneficial for irritated, itchy skin. If eczematic flare-ups are a problem for you, our list of NEA-approved face moisturizers for eczema is here to help.\nThe Best Face Moisturizers for Eczema, at a Glance:\nTatcha, The Indigo Cream, $25 SkinClinical, Extreme Healing Repair Cream, $29 CLn Facial Moisturizer, $35 Abby Rose, Soothe-X Face & Body Oil, $18 Pacifica, Vegan Ceramide Barrier Cream, $18 CeraVe, SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion, $15 Avéne, XeraCalm A.D. Lipid-Replenishing Cream, $36 Eczema Honey, Original Skin Soothing Cream, $30 Zo Skin Health, Hydrating Cream, $120 Avene, Soothing Eye Contour Cream, $32 La Roche-Posay, Lipikar Eczema Soothing Relief Cream, $16 Skinfix, Eczema+ Dermatitis Relief Balm, $45\nWhat Makes a Moisturizer Good for Eczema?\nEczema-prone skin is very sensitive to\ncertain ingredients, like isopropyl alcohol, lactic acid, and fragrance. In order to receive the Seal of Acceptance, products undergo rigorous testing to ensure they're free of known eczema irritants. The list includes (but is not limited to):\n- Added fragrance\n- Chemical UV absorbers\n- Benzocaine (a topical anesthetic)\n- Citrus extract\n- Formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers\nInstead, eczema-friendly formulas focus on hydrating ingredients like ceramides, emollients (like colloidal oatmeal or jojoba oil), and humectants (like hyaluronic acid, honey, or glycerin). They're fragrance-free, and may also include\nanti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide or aloe vera.\nHow to Test a Moisturizer for Eczema\nWhile products that hold the NEA's Seal of Acceptance, it's important to remember that everyone's skin is different. While the chances of NEA-approved products irritating eczema-prone skin is low, it's not impossible. \"The first time you apply a new product use a small amount (about the size of a pea) to the pulse of your wrist or the crook of your elbow,\"\nadvises the National Eczema Association. \"Do not wash the area for 24 to 48 hours and watch for any allergic reaction such as redness, a rash, any form of breakouts on the skin, itchiness, pain, flaking, etc.\"\nShop 12 Face Moisturizers for Eczema, Approved by the NEA\nTatcha, The Indigo Cream — $25.00\nThis velvety-rich cream is designed to tackle dryness and uneven texture on sensitive, eczema-prone skin. The star ingredient is natural Japanese Indigo extract, which calms and soothes skin, along with colloidal oatmeal to help relieve minor skin irritation and itching, and Hadasei-3, a trinity of anti-aging Japanese superfoods.\nSkinCinical, Extreme Healing Repair Concentrate — $29.00\nThe SkinClinical Extreme Healing Repair Concentrate is designed to immediately soothe and repair damaged skin by strengthening the skin’s natural\nmoisture barrier. In addition to soothing eczema-prone skin, this moisturizer also works for people with psoriasis, rosacea, diabetic ulcers, scars, burns, and more. CLn, Facial Moisturizer — $35.00\nThe CLn Facial Moisturizer combines\nniacinamide and ceramides to soothe and calm skin, help reduce the appearance of redness, and lock in moisture—all without clogging pores. It’s recommended to anyone dealing with redness, drying, flaking, eczema, acne, and/or rosacea. Abby Rose, Soothe-X Face & Body Oil — $18.00\nFinding an oil that works for eczema-prone skin can be tricky because many include potentially irritating essential oils. The Abby Rose Soothe-X Face & Body Oil is a fragrance-free combination of sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, hemp seed oil, jojoba seed oil, ballon plant, calendula flowers, and vitamin E oil. It works best when rubbed into damp skin.\nPacifica, Vegan Ceramide Barrier Cream — $18.00\nFormulated with vegan ceramides, amino acids, niacinamide, and shea butter, the Pacifica Beauty Vegan Ceramide Barrier Cream melts into your skin cream to hydrate and help restore your skin’s protective barrier.\nCeraVe, SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion — $15.00\nThe CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion uses zinc oxide and titanium oxide to reflect harmful UVA and UVB rays from the skin. While chemical sun blockers can be irritating to those with sensitive skin, this formula uses minerals so it’s safe for sensitive skin. It’s also made with niacinamide and three essential ceramides to help restore the skin’s natural barrier and lock in moisture.\nAvène, XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream — $36.00\nThe Avène XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream nourishes, soothes, and calms dry, itchy skin that’s prone to atopic dermatitis and eczema. It works by helping to rebalance the skin’s microbiome while supporting the skin’s defense system.\nEczema Honey, Original Skin Soothing Cream — $30.00\nThe Eczema Honey Original Skin Soothing Cream contains1 percent colloidal oatmeal, organic honey, beeswax, almond and organic sunflower oils, and organic aloe vera juice to soothe, moisturize, hydrate, and protect the skin. You can use it on the face and the body. Bonus: Use it with a cotton pad to remove makeup or as a lip balm\nZo Skin Health, Hydrating Crème — $120.00\nThe Zo Skin Health Hydrating Crème uses ophiopogon japonicus root extract, peptides, antioxidants, and colloidal oatmeal to temporarily relieve symptoms of severely dry skin while calming irritation and replenishing the skin’s natural moisture.\nAvène, Soothing Eye Contour Cream — $32.00\nThe Avène Soothing Eye Contour Cream smooths, moisturizes, and relieves redness, irritation, tightness, and puffiness with thermal spring water, dextran sulfate, antioxidants, and vitamin E.\nLa Roche-Posay, Lipikar Eczema Soothing Relief Cream — $16.00\nLa Roche-Posay Lipikar Eczema Soothing Relief Cream uses glycerin and shea butter to replenish skin’s essential lipids while providing instant, lasting hydration. It can be used both on the face and body.\nSkinfix, Eczema+ Dermatitis Relief Balm — $45.00\nThe Skinfix Eczema+ Dermatitis Relief Balm soothes facial\ndermatitis, eczema, and dry skin patches, leaving behind soothed and protected skin.\nLearn about the top five ingredients a dermatologist recommends for dry skin:\nFace Oils, Moisturizer, Skin-Care Tips, Well+Good SHOP\nLoading More Posts...",

    "text": "Don't miss a moment of the 2024 Tour de France! Get recaps, insights, and exclusive takes with Velo's daily newsletter.\nSign up today!.\n“What happened today was not the strategy that we had in mind at the start of the stage.”\nThat’s the admission of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe sport director Patxi Vila after\nBen O’Connor’s stunning smash-and-grab at the Vuelta a España Thursday.\nVuelta leader Primož Roglič may have been willing to relinquishing the red jersey temporarily, but what O’Connor achieved was something very different.\nHe wasn’t a lesser rider buried in the overall classification being allowed to borrow the race lead for a few days.\nInstead, the Australia was a proven, fully-fledged GC rival who wrested the jersey off Roglič’s back.\n“We had an important rider up the road for us and we felt like that we had an another option in the GC,” Vila said, referring to Florian Lipowitz.\n“What O’Connor did was incredible. The other teams pulled, with Movistar and others, but what he did on the final climb, to take time on everyone after being in the breakaway, that is a little bit of a surprise.”\nO’Connor put in one of the best performances of his career, and it left the peloton wondering what had happened in his wake.\nThe Australian made his move from the day’s big break on the Puerto del Vento climb inside the final 65km. He initially worked with Gijs Leemreize (Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL) to build a gap, then cast off the Dutchman with 28k remaining.\nHe then stomped to the third grand tour stage win of his career, finishing 4:33 ahead of runner-up Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech), and turned the Vuelta upside down.\nRoglič and many of the other GC contenders trailed in a distant, dismayed 6:31 down.\n“We know that Ben O’Connor is one of the best riders in the world. Today he was unbeatable,” said UAE Team Emirates sports director Joxean Fernández Matxin.\n“He was better than everyone. There was nothing to do. We were pulling, with Movistar, Red Bull, Lidl-Trek, Bahrain. We gave everything and he still took time on us all alone.”\n‘Maybe they underestimated me’\nO’Connor’s audacious move evokes memories of other such raids in the past.\nThink Claudio Chiappucci in the 1990 Tour de France, a breakaway which almost saw the Italian triumph over Greg LeMond.\nThink Oscar Pereiro in the 2006 Tour, a huge breakaway time gain which earned him the yellow jersey and, eventually, the Tour win.\nBut O’Connor is different.\nHe is a far more accomplished rider than either Chiappucci or Pereiro were at the time.\nHe won a stage of the Giro d’Italia in 2020, and took a stage of the Tour de France one year later.\nHe’s finished fourth in both the Giro and Tour in the past. He’s a big rider who is firmly on the radar of the other GC contenders and all the big teams.\nThere was nothing “lucky” about what he did, no anonymity to give him additional leeway.\nHe started this race as one of the favorites who could win overall. He’s now moved a huge leap closer to that goal.\n“Maybe they underestimated me,” O’Connor said. “I’ve been fourth in Tour and I was fourth in the Giro just gone. So it’s not like I’ve done nothing in races.”\nO’Connor needed a few days to get up to speed. He had an off day on Tuesday’s stage four due to the heat, losing time. That plus a subdued opening time trial saw him start Thursday’s stage 1:56 back.\nBut he slammed fully into top gear Thursday, hitting his potential with a vengeance.\nAs a result of his exploit, he is now a significant 4:51 ahead of Roglič. He’s a further eight seconds ahead of João Almeida (UAE Team Emirates), who is nervous about what happened.\n“Of course, we are worried about him,” he said. “He’s not just any rider. He took a five or six minutes out of everyone, but at least we still have more than two weeks left of this Vuelta.\n“It’s gonna be really hard to tip back those five or six minutes that he took today.”\nDid the rival teams mess it up? By the time they realized how far he was up the road, it was too late.\nCounting the cost of a major miscalculation\nThe coming days may reveal a little about O’Connor’s prospects of wearing the red jersey in Madrid in just over two weeks’ time.\nSaturday’s and Sunday’s stages are not in the high mountains but may still run the rule over each of the GC riders.\n“We’ll find out once we get to Cazorla and Granada,” O’Connor said. “And pretty much every single day after that. It’s an interesting race, and I guess it’s been turned a little bit into a different card than everyone thought.\n“It will be for some good watching on TV.”\nThat’s certainly true.\nFor now the rival teams will be wondering if giving O’Connor any leeway Thursday will prove to be a very serious miscalculation.\n“It’s always like that; when you know the results, after you know what you should’ve done,” said Matxin.\n“Adam Yates crashed at a critical moment for us [with about 20km to go] and that’s we could not pull then. You can always try to make the best of the situation, but when he takes seven minutes out of the entire peloton there’s nothing else to say.\n“Red Bull had their plan to let the breakaway go, and when we all saw that O’Connor had so much time everyone started to work. But when one is stronger than everyone else, there’s no one you can criticize or say they should’ve done something else.”\nRed Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe DS Vila similarly accepts that things didn’t turn out as planned.\n“The idea was to keep Lipowitz up there to see if he can hang on and move up in the GC, and also that we wouldn’t have to work.\n“We wouldn’t like it if one of our rival teams put another rider up on the GC. And of course, the idea was to make our rivals work today, like Movistar or UAE, which they did.\n“But what happened was O’Connor went a little bit beyond what anyone expected. To get back the time we’ll have to go little by little. There is still a lot of the race ahead of us.”\nBut he, Roglič, Almeida and others could still have some sleepless nights ahead.\n“Of course, we are worried about him. He’s not just any rider,” Almeida said. “And he took a five or six minutes out of everyone, but at least we still have more than two weeks left of this Vuelta. It’s gonna be really hard to tip back those minutes that he took today.\n“It was another hard stage very fast very hot, the key to recover. Of course we would’ve liked to have one of our riders up the road, but the break went away at an unexpected moment,” Almeida said.\nThe day was full of surprises, and Maxtin articulated the problem well.\nIt’d be one thing if bad tactics explained in full what happened, but it was more than that.\n“Five teams pulling, and he took time on all of us.”",

    "text": "CENTER POINT, Texas — The camp manager of an RV resort in Center Point, Texas, said he’s grateful to be alive after catastrophic flooding swept through the resort over the Fourth of July holiday. While his home was washed away, his quick actions helped save more than 20 lives.\n\"It was a long night,\" said George Davis, the campground manager of Guadalupe Keys RV Resort in Center Point. \"The thunder -- it was a very loud storm.\"\nDavis said his daughter and her family were visiting for the holiday when heavy rain began falling across the region. As the storm intensified, he monitored water levels up river, but wasn’t receiving alerts from nearby Ingram or Kerrville.\n\"I figured out why,\" he said. \"Those areas were completely destroyed by the water. The readings I was getting just didn’t make sense.\"\nTrusting his instincts, Davis made the call to evacuate the property. Approximately 25 people were staying at the resort at the time. He began with campers closest to the river’s edge.\n\"We went knocking on doors,\" he said. \"Grab your essentials. Get in your cars and get out. We need to evacuate.\"\nJust 30 minutes later, the danger was undeniable.\n\"Then we hear the wall of water coming,\" Davis said. \"It sounds kind of like a cross between a jet engine and a train rushing down the river. You can see all the debris caught in it.\"\nAfter safely ushering guests away from the river, Davis returned to his camper to retrieve a few personal items. But by the time he stepped outside, floodwaters had already surrounded his home.\n\"Trevor’s hollering at me, and when I came out, water was knee-deep around my camper,\" he said.\nThe water kept rising fast -- too fast to stop.\n\"That water rose 40 to 50 feet within a matter of 30 minutes,\" Davis said. \"It just moved those campers like a cork floating on water. It was like it was nothing.\"\nEventually, the floodwaters washed away Davis’s home and his belongings. Still, he said he’s not focused on the loss.\n\"For me and my family to get out alive ... we’re blessed and we’re very thankful,\" he said.\nAs of Thursday, Davis said he's staying with his daughter and her family as he works to recover. To aid in that recovery, his family started a GoFundMe. You can donate at this link.",

    "title": "Elliot Page named one of Time’s most influential people | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Halifax actor and activist Elliot Page has been recognized by Time , an American news magazine, as one of the most influential people of 2024 . The magazine’s list of 100 influential people is divided into categories like artists, leaders, innovators, and pioneers. Page is listed under icons, alongside fellow Canadians Michael J. Fox and Suzanne Simard. “A tremendous honor to be featured in Time’s 2024 #Time100 list,” wrote Page on Instagram Wednesday. Page released his first memoir Page Boy last summer and recently returned home to Halifax to present the Humanitarian Award at the Junos. Raquel Willis, a writer, editor, and transgender rights activist, penned a tribute to Page for the magazine. “I didn’t meet Elliot, the person, until early 2023. We bonded as transgender figures completing our debut memoirs. Elliot’s Pageboy ultimately landed at a time when conservatives were—as they still are—threatening trans people’s bodily autonomy and self-determination,” wrote Willis. “But Elliot remains undeterred, letting down the shield that his platform and privileges afford, and championing grassroots activist efforts like the Gen Z–guided Trans Prom at the U.S. Capitol. In whatever he does, Elliot is aware that his truth and power serve as a light in which others can see their own.” Atlantic Top Stories CTVNews.ca Top Stories B.C. tenants evicted for landlord's use after refusing large rent increase to take over neighbouring suite Ashley Dickey and her mother rented part of the same Coquitlam duplex in three different decades under three different landlords.

    "text": "A 69-year-old Brazilian woman legally working in Malta was denied a medical procedure at Mater Dei Hospital because, despite having paid National Insurance for three years, her age makes her ineligible for free healthcare.\nCarlinda Maria Torres de Oliveira Neves moved to Malta on a legitimate work permit. For the past three years, she has been paying National Insurance (NI) – even though the law says she should not have been – and receiving dialysis treatment for diabetes.\nHowever, when she went to Mater Dei Hospital last week for a procedure to unblock her fistula (a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein used to administer dialysis) the intervention was cancelled, despite her presenting documentation proving her legal status and payslips.\nShe was told that because she was over 65, she should not have been paying NI and is therefore ineligible for free healthcare. Yet, two days later (on Friday) her dialysis continued as usual, leading her son to believe it was a “bureaucratic issue”.\nHer son, Dennes Torres, who has been living in Malta for eight years and runs an IT consultancy business, spoke out about this because he feels it exposes discriminatory practices.\nUnder Maltese law, people over 65 can continue working but do not pay NI. When it comes to non-EU workers, also known as third-country nationals, they are entitled to free healthcare after proving they paid NI for a year. But the question is – what if a TCN comes to Malta at the age of 65 or after?\nMalta and Brazil do not currently have a bilateral social security agreement that coordinates contributions or benefits between the two countries – by, for example, recognising the NI paid in Brazil.\nDennes explains that he brought his mother to Malta about three years ago after the passing of her own elderly mother, with whom she had been living under the supervision of a caretaker in Brazil.\nAfter researching Maltese laws, checking with lawyers and government officials what his options were to bring his mother to live with him, Dennes followed the recommendation received and put his mother on his company’s payroll. As he filled in her paperwork, he noticed that the law stated she could not pay NI due to her age but he says she went on to pay the contributions based on advice from a reputable firm.\nFor three years, everything seemed in order. Carlinda lived in Malta and benefited from the healthcare in exchange for NI payments. As her health deteriorated, she began receiving dialysis treatment three times a week.\nBut on the day of her scheduled procedure, she was denied care. Dennes expressed concern that this could eventually affect her access to dialysis, which is a life-saving treatment.\nHe believes this is not just a personal issue but one that affects many other foreigners in Malta who are over 65.\n“We are willing to pay NI. We actually paid it. This is a problem for every foreigner in Malta who reaches over 65,” he said. He also indicated that if this situation remains unresolved, he may have to leave Malta and relocate his business.\nDennes criticised the system for suggesting private insurance as the only solution, despite the fact that most private insurers do not cover pre-existing conditions like diabetes. “In my mother’s situation, it’s useless,” he said.\nHe noted that, under current rules, third-country nationals become entitled to public healthcare after paying NI for one year. Before that, they must rely on private insurance – which often excludes chronic conditions like diabetes.\nHe pointed out the dilemma this creates for TCNs with chronic but manageable diseases, who may be left without care for up to a year due to this regulatory gap.\nFurthermore, he highlighted that Maltese law does not automatically recognise parents as family members under its Family Reunification Regulations for TCNs.\nQuestions were sent to the Health Ministry and Social Policy Ministry.",

    "text": "GREAT FALLS — The Great Falls Community Food Bank and Showdown Montana are teaming up once again for an annual food drive. On January 7th, you can get a $15 full-day all-area lift ticket at Showdown ski area if you bring 15 cans of non-perishable food or make a $20 donation to the food bank. If you already have a lift ticket or a season pass, you can donate $20 to be entered into a drawing for a free pass for next season. “I think this is around the 20th year that Showdown has done this for us,” said Shaun Tatarka, director of the Great Falls Community Food Bank. “It's just a huge fundraiser for us.” Last year was the largest year in the fundraiser’s history, raising more than $5,000 in addition to 2,000 pounds of food. The fundraiser will follow a $10,000 donation from General Mills to the food bank the previous week. “General Mills is one of probably maybe I'd say a dozen places that literally will come through for us every single year,” Tatarka said, “And General Mills has given us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 30 years.” Looking ahead to 2024, the food bank’s main concern is the price of groceries, which increased in 2023. They are hoping grocery prices are stagnant or even lower so they can continue to support the city in the least expensive way possible. “You know, the goal with the food bank is always just to make sure that we have enough food for all of our agencies,” Tatarka said, “Keep our backpack program up to date, which feeds kids K through six on weekends and holidays throughout the school year.” Even with the increase in costs and the change from a Saturday to a Sunday food drive, the food bank could not ask for a better community to be a part of. “We're really blessed to live in Great Falls,” Tatarka said, “There's a plethora of nonprofits in Great Falls, and we all struggle, but we all survive as well, and so I think that we're very fortunate to live in an extremely generous community.” The food drive takes place at Showdown Montana from open to close on Sunday, January 7th. Showdown is located about 65 miles southeast of Great Falls. [Click here](https://krtv.org/ShowdownInfo) to visit the website. TRENDING:",
