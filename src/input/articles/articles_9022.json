    "title": "Justin Trudeau has to step down, former B.C. premier Christy Clark says: 'I want the Liberal party that I used to vote for to come back'",
    "text": "OTTAWA—Former B.C. Liberal premier Christy Clark says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has got to step down.\nIn an interview with the Star, Clark said the message for Liberals after Monday’s Toronto-St. Paul’s byelection defeat is “unequivocal,” that Trudeau “doesn’t have the pull with voters that he once had, but more importantly, he isn’t even able to motivate some of the people in the country who are most likely to vote for his party. That’s a tough message for any leader.”\n×\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts Clark said she is not organizing a potential run for the job, saying it isn’t open. But she acknowledged that people are encouraging her to run if Trudeau does leave. She has not ruled that out, but said “I don’t have any of those plans ready to go.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Clark said she has no insight into whether Trudeau is truly reflecting on his political future, and she hasn’t spoken to him personally since 2017 when she left office.\n“What I do know is he’s a fighter. I do know he’s extremely competitive. And I do know that he has never lost an election or anything in his entire life. So, you know, I presume if he’s thinking about it at all, it’s a very difficult decision for him to make.”\nBut she said the results of Monday’s vote should not be ignored by him or the party.\nThe midtown Toronto riding, held by the Liberal party for the past 30 years is “bedrock for Liberal voters,” said Clark. “It’s the centre of the universe. And if people in that riding aren’t prepared to come out in the byelection and vote for him, I think it says a lot about the weakness the party is experiencing across the country.”\nBefore and after Monday’s vote, senior Liberal and Conservative campaign organizers who spoke to the Star agreed on the factors at play in the campaign: everything from fatigue with Trudeau or skepticism about his rival, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, high housing costs, the high cost of living, concerns about a rise in antisemitism, and about how the government responded to conflict in the Middle East. Each of the main parties miscalculated how those issues would play out in the result beforehand, however. The Liberals counted on a narrow win, and Conservatives expected a narrow loss.\nIn the end, in a vote where turnout was relatively good, the Conservative candidate won a stunning upset, with Don Stewart gaining 42.1 per cent of the vote (well up from the party’s showing of 25 per cent in the previous general election) and Liberal Leslie Church winning 40.5 per cent (down from the party’s 2021 showing of 49 per cent). The NDP was well behind at under 11 per cent, and the Greens at under three per cent.\nClark said while there may have been myriad issues at play in the byelection, “it’s impossible to separate issues from leadership.”\n“In my experience, if people don’t feel like the country is going in the right direction — and clearly Canada isn’t going in the right direction right now — they will blame the leader and they should. Because the leader sets the agenda. The leader is the one that gives direction to his or her cabinet. The leader is the one who sets the economic priorities or fails to do so.\n“Yeah, you can find exceptions to this rule, but it is almost always, all of it, is on the leader’s shoulders,” she said.\nClark, a senior adviser at the law firm Bennett Jones, served as B.C. Liberal premier from 2011 to 2017, and has been a critic of Trudeau’s in recent years.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Still, hers is the view of someone who once identified strongly with the federal Liberal party.\n“I want the Liberal party that I used to vote for to come back,” she said.\nClark worked for the party in the 1990s, was national youth campaign director for Jean Chrétien’s 1993 campaign, later worked for senior cabinet minister Doug Young, and returned to B.C. in 1996, where she was elected and sat first in opposition under B.C. Liberal leader Gordon Campbell. She served in his government as deputy premier. Clark left politics in 2005, but returned to replace Campbell in 2011, and won a come-from-behind victory in the 2013 provincial election. Under her, the party narrowly won the 2017 election, with one seat shy of a majority, but did not hold onto power after the NDP and Greens struck a deal to govern.\nShe said the federal Liberals and Conservatives have long had many points of disagreement, but in her view they used to agree on the need for economic growth, job creation and “responsible economic management.” It’s not a question that the party has moved too far to the left, she said, but it has lost its focus.\n“I don’t think you can really characterize the world in terms of left and right anymore. I just don’t … really accept that paradigm. To me, governments can enable or they can impair economic growth. And that’s not really a left-right issue.”\nClark blasted Trudeau for failing on three main points: on stimulating economic growth; on failing to meet international commitments on defence and managing the Canada-U.S. relationship (“Canada has really lost its lustre when it comes to meeting our international commitments and being respected internationally”); and on national unity, where she blamed Trudeau for fighting with premiers “all the time,” “setting regions against each other” and showing “favouritism.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “People out in this part of the country really feel forgotten. And there is a sense that the prime minister is playing some regions of the country off the other for his own political gain. And I don’t think anybody in the country benefits from that … It can never work for Canada. And over time, I think we all know, that’s a path that can lead to a pretty dangerous place for our country.”\nSenior Liberals say there is a robust reflection going on inside the party organization and the Prime Minister’s Office, and many discussions are taking place with caucus members, cabinet ministers who campaigned on the ground and senior officials. While they have not ruled out convening an early caucus meeting to discuss the way forward, no in-person meetings are scheduled at the moment.\nThe prime minister has not taken reporters’ questions in the three days since the byelection loss, although he has delivered brief prepared remarks this week in which he indicated he “heard” voters and his main focus remains on the interests of Canadians.\nTonda MacCharles is Ottawa Bureau Chief and a senior reporter covering federal politics.

    "text": "La primera sorpresa de la edición 2024 del US Open de tenis corrió por cuenta del neerlandés Botic van de Zandschulp, número 74 de la clasificación mundial de la ATP: venció en sets corridos al español Carlos Alcaraz, uno de los grandes favoritos, y lo eliminó en la segunda ronda del torneo. Alcaraz, campeón de este torneo en 2022 y ganador de la medalla de plata en los Juegos Olímpicos París 2024, tuvo una noche para el olvido y perdió este jueves por 6-1, 7-5 y 6-4. (Lea también: La Selección Colombia revela la convocatoria para la doble fecha de eliminatoria: la lista de Néstor Lorenzo contra Perú y Argentina) Es la primera vez que pierde contra el neerlandés, en su tercer enfrentamiento: le había ganado en la primera ronda del Abierto de Australia, en 2021, y en segunda ronda del torneo de Basilea (Suiza) en 2022. Alcaraz perdió la oportunidad de convertirse en el tercer tenista de la historia en ganar consecutivamente Roland Garros, Wimbledon y el US Open, además de perder un invicto de 15 partidos en competencias de grand slam. El español nunca le encontró la vuelta al partido y mostró un juego irreconocible, hasta el punto de cometer 27 errores no forzados, algo inusual en él. Noticia en desarrollo. DEPORTES",

    "title": "Malaysia’s 5G turmoil continues",
    "text": "- Malaysia’s telecom sector is once again in turmoil over the country’s 5G networks plan - The government recently selected U Mobile to build the country’s second national 5G network - The decision has come in for widespread criticism, not least because of U Mobile’s shareholder structure - The mobile operator has tried to appease the critics, but to little avail Malaysia and 5G are, it seems, not the most settled of bedfellows, as the fallout from the recent award of a contract to build and run the country’s second 5G network has shown. The country already has one 5G network, the Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) shared network, in which most of the country’s main mobile operators – namely [CelcomDigi](https://corporate.celcomdigi.com/news/celcomdigi-completes-share-subscription-agreement-with-mof-inc-and-dnb),[ Maxis](https://maxis.listedcompany.com/news.html/id/2500923),[ U Mobile](https://www.u.com.my/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/u-mobile-successfully-completes-ssa-with-dnb-and-mof-inc--) and YTL Communications – eventually acquired stakes earlier this year, with Telekom Malaysia (TM) the only telco that didn’t complete a transaction. The agreements to take a stake in the DNB came just as the operators were lining up to bid to be the government’s preferred partner for the construction of a second, competitive 5G network – see [Malaysia’s telcos jostle over second 5G network](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/5g/malaysia-s-telcos-jostle-over-second-5g-network-50802/). The expectation was that, in a country with about 50 million mobile connections, either market leader CelcomDigi (with more than 20 million mobile customers) or Maxis (with almost 13 million mobile customers) would prevail, ahead of U Mobile (with just over 9 million mobile customers). Then in early November, U Mobile was [awarded the deal](https://www.u.com.my/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/u-mobile-thanks-the-malaysian-government--ready-to-roll-out-seco) by Malaysia’s government to build out the second 5G network, an award that comes with spectrum licences but no government funding. The decision is controversial: It came as a surprise to many industry watchers and attracted criticism from multiple quarters, not least because U Mobile is not one of the market leaders and is a privately held company whose main shareholder (with a 48% stake) is Straits Mobile Investment Pte, a wholly owned unit of Singapore-based infrastructure investor ST Telemedia. At the time of the contract award, U Mobile noted that, “in alignment with our commitment to the national agenda,” it planned to “reduce its foreign majority shareholding to 20%, ensuring greater Malaysian control and inviting participation from local investors.” Clearly, that pledge wasn’t enough and, on 10 November, U Mobile [issued a follow-up statement](https://www.u.com.my/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/u-mobile-announces-strategic-alignment-of-shareholder-ownership-) to note that Straits Mobile Investment had agreed to reduce its stake to 20%. “While foreign ownership is common in the telco sector, U Mobile’s strategy prioritises Malaysian industry development and strengthening of local ownership. This increased local partnership supports U Mobile’s dedication to national interests,” it stated. It also felt compelled to stress its worthiness. “U Mobile has invested over 5bn Malaysian ringgit [US$1.12bn] in its network infrastructure, expanding its national population coverage from 67.5% in 2018 to 95% by early 2024, and has installed over 10,000 sites to date. This places it on par and competitively with its peers. U Mobile prides itself for constantly investing in its network to make it AI-powered and more autonomous. U Mobile, with its shareholders and vendor partners, have successfully completed its national 3G and 4G network rollouts and are committed to invest in the 5G deployment, using private sector funding only,” it added. The country’s telecom regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), was clearly also feeling the heat, as it [issued a statement](https://www.mcmc.gov.my/en/media/press-releases/pemilihan-u-mobile-sdn-bhd-sebagai-penyedia-rangka) to stress that a “rigorous selection process” was followed in awarding the contract to U Mobile. And the controversy doesn’t appear to be subsiding. The government continues to face criticism for the decision, with suggestions that U Mobile landed the deal thanks to its links to Malaysia’s king, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, who holds about 22%, and the business power of U Mobile’s founder and chairman, pan-industry tycoon Vincent Tan: That kind of suggestion is embarrassing for Malaysia’s Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who pledged to stamp out cronyism when he came to power in 2022, according to Bloomberg in [this report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/malaysia-prime-minister-anwar-faces-003305026.html). “The award process goes against Anwar’s commitment to good governance,” Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at consultancy firm ADA Southeast Asia, told Bloomberg. “This could impact investor confidence,” he added. The contract award may have been announced and the government appears to be holding firm, saying that its decision is binding, but the turmoil in Malaysia’s telecom sector seems far from over. - Ray Le Maistre, Editorial Director, TelecomTV Email Newsletters Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.",

Photo Credit: Steelton PD (overlay); Google Maps (Street View) Kier Hashawn Sims has been charged with criminal homicide in connection with the death of Otilio Lugo-Rivera at The Hideout strip club in Steelton on March 23, as Daily Voice previously reported.\nEyewitnesses told police about the brutal beating Sims gave Lugo-Rivera at the club located at 159 North Front Street. Following the autopsy, \"board-certified forensic pathologist, Dr. Wayne K.

According to court records, the York warrant appears to be for a probation violation.\nAfter \"those warrants are remedied, he will be transferred to Dauphin County Prison,\" the police added.\nThe Dauphin County District Attorney's Office, the Dauphin County Forensic Team, the Dauphin County Criminal Investigation Division, and the U.S. Marshals Service worked together to track down Sims.\nto follow Daily Voice York and receive free news updates.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
