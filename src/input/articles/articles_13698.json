    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "The sinking of Russia's Novocherkassk warship by Ukrainian airstrike and several Sukhoi fighter jets in recent days suggests Russia's military is unable to defend itself against Western missiles, reservist Estonian Defense Forces Col. Hannes Toomsalu said. Additionally, there may be a shortage of experienced pilots.\n\"The ship was allegedly hit by a French SCALP [ long-range cruise missile ]. And the Ukrainian SU-27 fired. Whether the planes that fired [the missiles] were shot down or not, the SCALP has a range of 560 kilometers. So you do not have to go into the air defense zone at all – now it is possible to hit the target from further away,\" said Toomsalu.\n\"As for the [Russian] planes, there is a possibility that they were shot down by Patriots [surface-to-air missiles] – this is the most likely option. The other possibility is that the Russians have actually run out of pilots. The young do not yet understand how to fight old, experienced ones,\" he said.\nBefore Christmas, Russia said it shot down three fighter aircraft and one tactical bomber, which Ukraine denies .\nCol. Eero Rebo. Source: Siim Lõvi /ERR On the ground, Russian forces are advancing step by step, and the Ukrainians are on the defensive. Aid packages for Ukraine are stuck in the U.S. Congress and EU. No further decisions will be made until 2024.\nUntil then, the Ukrainians just have to stand their ground, said Eero Rebo, chief of the General Staff of the volunteer Estonian Defense League (Kaitseliit).\n\"The Ukrainians have stood firm for nine-plus years. They're certainly still standing,\" said Rebo. \"Now is probably the worst time to seek any kind of peace, with the Russian Federation elections coming up in March.\"\nRussia is unlikely to launch a new wave of mobilization before the presidential elections. At the same time, it is currently using fewer missiles than usual. Experts believe the country is probably preparing for activities on the front after the elections.\nToomsalu said the Russian troops' next offensive can be expected in the spring, for example in April.\nRebo said: \"The Ukrainians, of course, also see fear in the Russian mobilization and, as I understand it, are preparing their own mobilization.\"\n--\nFollow ERR News on Facebook and Twitter and never miss an update!\nEditor: Barbara Oja, Helen Wright\nSource: Aktuaalne kaamera\nrussia ukraine eero rebo hannes toomsalu russian presidential elections 2024",

    "text": "Park City senior center now open four days a week The center is now open Monday through Thursday; previously, it was only two days a week. The Park City senior center is located on Woodside Avenue, down the street from Library Field. The updated hours are 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Wednesdays the center opens to members in the bridge and mahjong classes. Lunch will still be served Mondays and Thursdays. Registration is required, and a $3 donation is suggested. The president of the Park City senior center board, Liz Novak, said expanding hours will help accommodate growing demand. The center has more than 500 members. “Fortunately, we don't have 500 members come to the center all days that we’re open. But when they do come, we are cheek to jowl,” Novak told the Summit County Council Feb. 28. The council allocated $94,000 for senior services in fiscal year 2024, $8,200 of that specifically for Park City, which Novak said helped expand Park City’s hours. Utah law requires counties to provide senior services. Summit County operates three senior centers in Park City, Coalville and Kamas. “There continues to be a challenge of isolation and loneliness, depression, for a large number of people in the county who are seniors,” said Craig Weekly, another Park City board member. “And yet the senior center movement here in Coalville, in Kamas and in Park City, I think, is doing a tremendous amount to address those issues.” Any Summit County resident 60 and older can join.
