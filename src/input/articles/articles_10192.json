    "text": "总台记者当地时间12日从巴勒斯坦方面获悉，以军当天在加沙地带中部内察里姆走廊附近的一处援助物资分发点开火， 造成至少13人死亡、约200人受伤。\n　　巴勒斯坦方面报道称，以军近期将加沙地带南部城市拉法和加沙中部的援助物资分发点作为袭击目标，造成数十人死亡。11日，该援助中心有28人死亡、数十人受伤。自今年5月实施援助物资分配方案以来，加沙地带遇难者死亡总数已超过140人、另有数百人受伤。\n　　以色列方面对此暂无回应。\n　　今年5月，以色列经由私营援助组织“加沙人道主义基金会”提出援助物资分配方案。根据这一方案，私营企业将负责援助工作、将援助物资运往加沙南部数个所谓“安全分发站点”进行分发，而联合国机构以及已在巴勒斯坦运作数十年的援助组织则被排除在外。这一方案获得美国支持。（总台记者 江浩宇）\n标签：",

De quoi révolutionner la santé publique Chaque jour apporte son lot de nouvelles passionnantes. Le médicament [de type Ozempic, ndt] s'est d'abord attaqué au diabète. Puis il a lutté contre l'obésité, au prix d'une seule injection par semaine. Aujourd'hui, on s'en sert pour traiter les maladies cardiovasculaires et rénales, et on les teste sur la maladie d'Alzheimer et la toxicomanie. Rien n'est encore sûr, mais les agonistes des récepteurs GLP-1 [comme l'Ozempic, ndt] ont tout pour devenir l'une des classes de médicaments les plus efficaces de l'histoire. En devenant moins chers et plus faciles à utiliser, ils promettent d'améliorer considérablement la vie de plus d'un milliard de personnes, avec des conséquences profondes pour l'industrie, l'économie et la société.\nBientôt des génériques planétaires\nDepuis que le sémaglutide [agoniste du récepteur GLP-1, ndt] a été approuvé pour le traitement de l'obésité, il y a trois ans, on se l'arrache aux États-Unis. Après des décennies de \"remèdes miracles\" décevants, ces médicaments fonctionnent. Les influenceurs soucieux de leur image et les financiers fortunés ne sont pas les seuls à les utiliser. Un adulte américain sur huit a déjà pris des \"médicaments GLP-1\". Novo Nordisk, le fabricant du sémaglutide commercialisé sous les marques Ozempic pour le diabète et Wegovy pour la perte de poids, et Eli Lilly, qui fabrique le tirzépatide, une alternative plus efficace, ont à eux deux ajouté environ 1 000 milliards de dollars à la valeur du marché depuis 2021.\nLe phénomène dépasse désormais les frontières des États-Unis. Avec plus des deux cinquièmes de la population mondiale en surpoids ou obèse, la demande en médicaments GLP-1 est avide. Les laboratoires pharmaceutiques s'efforcent de les transformer en pilules, moins chères à produire que les injections, et d'en réduire les effets secondaires. Des versions génériques d'anciens agonistes du GLP-1 arrivent sur le marché. Le brevet du sémaglutide expirera en 2026 au Brésil, en Chine et en Inde ; huit médicaments…\nLe nouvel Economiste",

    "text": "Is Job Hopping A Problem? This CEO Thinks So, But Not Everyone Agrees\nThe entrepreneur mentioned that job hopping was once seen as a red flag but believes it is now challenging to build a strong team when employees leave too soon.\nUline, the office supply company owned by Elizabeth Uihlein, is making headlines over its strong stance on job-hopping among young employees. Referring to them as “The Nomads,\" Elizabeth expressed frustration over staff members resigning before their second anniversary. She attributed the trend to “free insurance, the pandemic, and parenting\".\nA Reddit user shared a photo of a letter she wrote for a magazine, which was also posted on Uline’s website. In it, Elizabeth noted that job-hopping was once a red flag, as past generations valued job stability and career progression. She voiced concern that frequent resignations make it difficult to build a strong, cohesive team.\nShe wrote, “Job hopping used to be frowned on. Red flags on resumes. Something previous generations did their best to avoid. You stuck with a job, showed stability and worked your way up, but boy, how times have changed. What makes it so easy for young workers to pull up stakes and move on? Why don’t they prioritize job security and financial stability more? Maybe, it’s because they don’t have to. At Uline, young people are resigning before their two-year anniversary at a higher rate than we’d like. We call them ‘The Nomads’.\"\nElizabeth Uihlein believes young employees switch jobs too quickly due to several factors. She argues that free insurance, such as staying on parents’ health plans until age 26, makes it easier for them to quit without worrying about coverage. She also points to the COVID-19 pandemic, which normalized remote work and weakened workplace bonds, reducing employees’ commitment to their jobs. Additionally, she criticises modern parenting for being too lenient and focused on friendship rather than independence, leading to a generation that relies too much on their parents. In her view, young people need to be pushed to stand on their own instead of depending on external support.\n“Employers are always on the lookout for young, talented candidates. It’s hard to build a winning team when the rookies you sign think they are free agents before they even take the field,\" Uihlein concluded.\nReacting to the post, a user wrote, “If employers offered us even a modicum of stability, gave us meaningful COLAs, and provided us with half the work-life balance some European countries have, this wouldn’t be an issue. It’s entirely the fault of across-the-board sociopathic American business leadership.\"\n“I’ve very rarely seen someone leave a job for reasons other than money. It’s always the people who don’t want to pay that have a problem it is that simple,\" a comment read.\nAn individual shared, “The entire reason I make a good salary is because I job hopped. I make 30-60% more for going to work for a competitor, and 1-3% cost of living adjustment each year for being a loyal employee. It’s a big fat no brainer.\"\nView All\nView all\nOne more added, “At least she’s being honest about why corporations are against universal healthcare. They use it as a tool to keep you in line.\"\nAccording to Forbes, Elizabeth Uihlein and her husband, who started Uline in 1980, have spent over $70 million on the 2023-2024 election cycle. Initially, they supported Ron DeSantis, but later, they switched their support to Donald Trump.\n- Location :\n- First Published:",

One of the ways to prepare is to create a safety plan, Jordan said.\n“If a person calls, we help them to identify maybe some safe people in their life, who can provide some support,“ Jordan said. “Can they possibly pack a bag and keep it at their home? Do they have someone who is able to provide transportation when they are ready to get out?”\nSafe Berks operates a 24-hour hotline and crisis service with trained staff members who can connect people to emergency shelter, legal services or help come up with a safety plan. A\n Medical Advocacy Partnership Program sends an advocate to hospitals to help those hurt as a result of domestic violence or sexual assault. A staff member is stationed at the courthouse to help those seeking a Protection from Abuse Order from 7 p.m. until midnight.\nDomestic Violence Services of Cumberland and Perry has similar services, including emergency shelter. Staff members are there to answer the phone, even late in the evening on holidays. Executive Director Sonya Browne said she has not seen an uptick in people seeking help during this season, but services stay the same as the rest of the year.\n“I noticed there were a couple shifts done over the holidays where people just wanted to talk, and so our staff, if they have time, they’re there for that also,” Browne said.\nThe data on whether domestic violence increases during the holidays is inconclusive,\nsome domestic violence advocates have noted.\nNational Domestic Violence hotline, which fields domestic violence calls from different states, does not track individual reports and incidents of domestic violence.\nThe hotline’s latest impact report does show there has been an increase of people reaching out for help annually for the last three years. Here are other places that provide emergency domestic violence support, including during the holidays.",

    "text": "CATLETTSBURG A 39-year-old man pleaded guilty on Thursday to multiple charges after throwing the contents of his colostomy bag at hospital workers last summer. Joshua A. Potter, of an unknown address, was jailed following the incident at the King’s Daughters emergency department in early July for reportedly attacking hospital workers with feces after ripping open his own colostomy bag, per previous reports. Potter was indicted shortly thereafter on charges of third-degree assault on medical personnel, third-degree criminal mischief, trespassing and public intoxication. On Thursday, Potter appeared via video conference from the Boyd County Detention Center to enter a guilty plea alongside his attorney, Whitney Davis. Boyd Circuit Judge John Vincent said he was “particularly interested” in the details surrounding the third-degree assault charge before accepting the settled plea agreement between prosecutors and Davis. “Well ...” Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Kierston Rosen began before elaborating on the allegations against Potter. Rosen said Potter attempted to throw “fecal matter” at hospital employees but added, “thankfully,” no worker was hit by Potter’s colostomy contents. In exchange for Potter’s admissions to third-degree assault, public intoxication and third-degree criminal mischief, the Commonwealth proposed to dismiss his charge of trespassing. With the narrowly missed victims’ and law enforcement’s approval, Vincent accepted the plea arrangement and sentenced Potter according to the Commonwealth’s suggestion. Potter was sentenced to 90 days in jail for both public intoxication and criminal mischief (the maximum for both charges) and five years for third-degree assault on medical personnel. In accordance with his plea arrangement, Potter will serve 180 days in jail and the remaining balance of the five-year sentence will be served under supervised probation. One of the terms of his probation is to abide by Vincent’s order to stay away from all KDMC properties, unless in a “dire medical emergency.” Vincent said if Potter violates any probation condition or trespasses on KDMC property, his probation could be revoked — meaning the five-year sentence would be served behind bars.",

    "text": "The Canadian soccer teams would do anything to win matches, even if that means allegedly spying on opponents. The women's national team was caught spying on a private New Zealand practice earlier this week, and that's led to a history of dishonest and rule-breaking practices from the country's national soccer teams being uncovered. Both the men's and women's sides have spied on opponents' closed-off practices \"for years,\" according to a report from TSN . This scandal extends back to at least the 2021 Olympics when the women's national team won the gold medal in Tokyo. The report has caused an ongoing downfall within the country's soccer programs. Here's all you need to know about unraveling scandal. MORE: Canada women's soccer defeats New Zealand to begin 2024 Paris Olympics Canada soccer drone scandal, explained The scandal began to unravel when New Zealand women's soccer players reported a drone flying over their practice a few days prior to their matchup with Canada at the 2024 Paris Olympics. It initially seemed to be a one-time thing, as Canada denounced the \"non-accredited member of the Canada soccer support team\" who committed the act. A report from TSN on Thursday alleges that this has been happening \"for years.\" TSN spoke with two sources with \"first-hand knowledge,\" though neither was named for safety reasons. Spying on opponents was allegedly part of some people's jobs, and the soccer teams told the staff members \"they could lose their positions with the federation if they did not go along with the demands.\" \"In a couple of scenarios, people have been pushed and have been told, 'You have to give 110 percent, and this is part of the job, so if you don’t feel comfortable with doing this, you do not have a place on the team,'\" one source told TSN. \"It’s not something that’s talked about and it’s not something there are a lot of text messages about because of how sensitive this is. Some of the people who have had to do the filming or review the filming have said to a few staff members how uncomfortable it was for them.\" A source detailed that staff members would use bushes, fences, and trees to stay hidden while spying on an opposing team at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Furthermore, the staff knew it was harder to do this in foreign countries. At home, the coaches and executives know where everyone practices and plays. MORE: 2024 Olympic football results, updated LIVE | Who will win women's gold medal in 2024? \"When you're abroad, it requires a little bit more research,\" a source said. \"When you are in Concacaf events, you do have the ability of finding out where the rest of the teams are training because Concacaf, FIFA, and the Olympics, they all publish where the teams are training in one way or another. You also know just by looking at the social medias from the other teams and seeing what pictures they are posting.\" The source said that while this is widely considered cheating, the \"coaches just see it as a competitive advantage and justify it by saying everyone does it.\" Brev Priestman, the Canadian women's national team head coach, apologized for the drone incident that happened earlier that week. Still, the head coach was removed from the team for the 2024 Olympics. Andy Spence, the assistant coach, will take over head coaching duties. \"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" the Canadian Olympic Committee stated. \"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women's National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman, for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.\" While Priestman wasn't officially fired, it's unclear if she will ever return to the team. What the investigation uncovers will likely be the determining factor in that decision The Sporting News will update this story as more information becomes public.",

Voir ça depuis une ville, c’est assez dingue. J’étais comme une enfant devant ma fenêtre. »\nUne photo prise par Mélissa Nocera depuis son domicile à Bègles. (©Document transmis à actu Bordeaux) « On pouvait apercevoir les lueurs rouges à l’œil nu… Évidement pas aussi intensément que sur les photos mais c’était juste incroyable », explique-t-elle.\n« Une occasion en or » En Sud-Gironde , Timothée Gimenez s’est lui positionné à l’écart de la ville pour éviter la pollution lumineuse et profiter des meilleures conditions possibles.\nVidéos : en ce moment sur Actu Visualiser le contenu sur Instagram\nCe jeune photojournaliste a posé son trépied dans un champ à Auros, près de Bazas, pour immortaliser ce moment. « C’est un phénomène rare, c’était une occasion en or », savoure-t-il.\nJ'avais déjà eu l'occasion de voir les aurores boréales du 10 mai donc ce n'était pas une découverte mais ça reste spectaculaire et touchant. Je voulais essayer de faire mieux encore que la dernière fois.\nTimothée Gimenez Ce dernier n’a pas retouché ses photos mais il ajuste les paramètres, comme la luminosité ou le contraste, pour optimiser le rendu.\nLes aurores boréales aperçues ici à Saint-Médard-en-Jalles. (©Document transmis à actu Bordeaux / laurencepoullaouec) Résultat, « les couleurs ressortent davantage qu’à l’œil nu ». « Pour les voir comme sur les photos, il faudrait être à des latitudes comme la Scandinavie ou le pôle nord », précise le jeune homme.\nÀ Bordeaux, à Pessac ou d’autres villes de l’agglomération bordelaise, d’autres photographes ont réussi aussi à immortaliser ces aurores boréales.\nCe jeudi soir était « un des jours où on avait le plus de chances d’en voir cette année », expliquait, auprès d’ actu.fr , Olivier Katz, prévisionniste au Comea.\nSuivez toute l’actualité de vos villes et médias favoris en vous inscrivant à Mon Actu .\n#Aurores boréales",

    "title": "CNBC's Inside India newsletter: The humble onion could be holding India's economy hostage",
    "text": "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe\nhere.\nThe big story\nA curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.\nSo, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.\nAnd it has been for the past year.\nThe price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.\nPoor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has\npreviously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.\nMoney Report\nTemperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.\nFood prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.\n\"The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,\" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. \"Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,\" he added.\nKeeping rates elevated, though, appears to be \"an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,\" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.\nThe anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.\n\"Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,\" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.\nThe government also has the option to remove import taxes — currently set at 40% on wheat — to hold prices down.\nYet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.\nLowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.\nFor now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice. These grains are then redistributed to low-income families at no cost, making it the world's biggest food welfare program.\nThere are signs that these cost pressures are unlikely to abate soon due to further bad weather. This week, at least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods in India's northeastern region, a key rice-growing area.\nBut, an elevated inflation and interest rate environment haven't appeared to deter companies or investors.\n\"You talk to Indian companies, and even with inflation at 6%, they barely bat an eyelid because they're growing at twice that or more,\" said James Thom, lead fund manager of the\nabrdn New India Investment Trust, which trades like an ETF in London. \"[They] are used to operating with that level of inflation for decades.\"\n\"That's just the norm,\" he added.\nNeed to know\nApple's India supplier allegedly excluded married women from jobs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked a government department to look into reports that Apple supplier\nFoxconn rejected married women from iPhone assembly jobs in the country. Foxconn hiring agents and HR sources interviewed by the Reuters news agency cited family duties, pregnancy and higher absenteeism as reasons why Foxconn did not hire married women at the plant. Foxconn said it \"vigorously refutes\" those allegations.\nS&P upgrades Adani Ports, predicts resilient earnings growth. The credit ratings agency lifted its outlook on\nAdani Ports & SEZ from neutral to positive, saying the company will likely see resilient earnings growth and cash flow. Adani Ports' shares have risen nearly three times since the low it hit after the release of an explosive report by short-seller Hindenburg.\n'One of the cheapest ways' to invest in India's infrastructure boom. Infrastructure spending is rising, and Causeway Capital Management's Arjun Jayaraman is bullish on one\npure-play infrastructure stock [subscriber content] which is predicted to benefit significantly. Jayaraman also believes the stock is \"very low risk\" as it is a state-owned enterprise.\nU.S. diplomat says America needs more Indian students for sciences. Kurt Campbell, the deputy secretary of state,\nsaid U.S. universities should welcome more students from India to study sciences, and not from China. He noted that colleges were limiting Chinese students' access to sensitive technology given security concerns.\nWhat happened in the markets?\nIndian stocks are on track for the best monthly gain this year. The\nNifty 50 index closed above 24,000 points for the first time as it heads for a 2% gain this week. The index has risen 10% this year.\nThe benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield has ticked up slightly to just under the 7% mark and is back to where it was two weeks ago.\nOn CNBC TV this week, Amish Shah, head of India research at Bank of America, said that if the Indian government decides to allocate more money toward capital expenditure rather than increase welfare spending in its upcoming budget, it could\ntrigger a stock market rally. BofA expects the Nifty 50 index to rise to 24,500 points.\nMeanwhile, Neeraj Aggarwal, Asia-Pacific chair of Boston Consulting Group, said that India's gain from the world diversifying away from China is still early. However, he added that \"\na lot more work needs to be done\" by the Indian government to promote manufacturing and the creation of jobs.\nWhat's happening next week?\nIndian government bonds will be included in the JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index on Friday.\nEither India or defending champions England will play South Africa in the T20 Cricket World Cup tournament this weekend, June 29. Thursday's semi-final in Guyana has been delayed by rain.\nShares of Indian liquor exporter Allied Blenders & Distillers debut on the stock market on July 1, and steel maker Vraj Iron & Steel lists on July 3.\nJune 28: Indian government bonds included in JPMorgan bond index, U.S. inflation\nJuly 1: Manufacturing PMI: India, Russia, euro zone, U.K. and U.S.\nJuly 2: Euro zone inflation and unemployment rate\nJuly 3: Services PMI: India, Russia, euro zone, U.K. and U.S.\nJuly 4: U.K. general election",

The strong winds associated with the yellow [weather](https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/li/weather.in.Newport/) warning is also set to cause: - Delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport - Coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves - Bus and train services will be affected (with some journeys taking longer) - Short term loss of power and other services - Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges A Met Office spokesperson added: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. \"Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\" Everywhere in Wales set to be affected by the strong wind warning Areas of Wales set to be impacted by the yellow weather warning issued by the Met Office are: - Blaenau Gwent - Bridgend - Caerphilly - Cardiff - Carmarthenshire - Ceredigion - Conwy - Gwynedd - Isle of Anglesey - Merthyr Tydfil - Monmouthshire - Neath Port Talbot - Newport - Pembrokeshire - Powys - Rhondda Cynon Taf - Swansea - Torfaen - Vale of Glamorgan How to prepare for the yellow weather warning and strong winds The Met Office has issued advice on how to prepare for the yellow weather warning over the weekend and the strong winds that have been forecast. A Met Office spokesperson said: \"Give yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary. \"People cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. \"It’s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items. \"If you are on the coast, stay safe during stormy weather by being aware of large waves. Even from the shore large breaking waves can sweep you off your feet and out to sea. \"Take care if walking near cliffs; know your route and keep dogs on a lead. In an emergency, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. \"Be prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.\" The yellow weather warning will be in place across south Wales from 11am on Saturday, December 30 until 3am on Sunday, December 31.
