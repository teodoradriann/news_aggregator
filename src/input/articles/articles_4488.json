    "text": "A pilot has been praised for their quick thinking after an easyJet flight almost collided with another plane in an air traffic control error.\nThe controller is believed to have \"forgotten\" about another plane waiting to take off before allowing an Airbus A320 with 179 people on board, from Gatwick Airport to Bordeaux-Merignac, to come into land.\nAnd the incident on New Year's Eve last year has now been classified as a \"serious encounter\" by a French investigative body.\nThe organisation has pointed the finger at air traffic control for forgetting about the other plane, a Robin DR400 awaiting take-off, and giving the green light for the A320 to touch down.\n✈️ Need quick assistance with a personal touch?\n👉 Introducing our Live Chat & WhatsApp services.\nOur friendly team is ready to answer your questions 👋\n🗨️ Simply message us here for Live Chat ➡️ https://t.co/meUAZqJyYB\n📱 Or here for WhatsApp ➡️ https://t.co/JOHo7CIX1p\n— easyJet (@easyJet) September 20, 2023 Pilots of easyJet flight were 'not aware of the other aircraft'\nFrance's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety said on the day of the incident that \"the shift manager... had reduced the number of controllers to three\" down from six, in a new report.\nIt stated: \"FR traffic then became very dense. The controller ... late authorised the A320 to land, forgetting the presence of the DR400 at the threshold.\n\"The DR400 pilot, having understood that the A320 was authorized to land while still at threshold 23, reported to the controller, who immediately ordered the A320 to abort the approach.\"\nIt explained how the pilots on the easyJet flight were never aware of the other aircraft.\nAn easyJet spokesperson told the Daily Star: \"We are aware of the report regarding the ATC error which confirms that our pilots followed procedures at all times. The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and we will always co-operate with safety investigations.\"\n. @easyJet get a lot of criticism, but I’ve just seen the most beautiful love & care shown to a passenger on my flight with severe anxiety & panic attacks. The pilot even came to see him to reassure him before take off. People can be lovely 💜\n— Anna Yearley Carreira (@AnnaYearley) December 28, 2023 The report continued: \"The tower manager and the controller, surprised, then became aware of the situation. The A320 crew, mainly focused on the endpoint during the final approach, never identified the presence of an aircraft at the runway threshold.\n\"The missed approach was nominally executed by the easyJet crew. The lowest point of the trajectory was located at a height of 103 ft, at a distance of approximately 290 m from the runway threshold. The A320 flew over the DR400 at a height of 178 ft, then continued on the standard trajectory.\"\nThankfully a disaster was averted and the DR400 later got the all-clear for take-off with the Airbus making a smooth landing on its second attempt.\nThe DR400 pilot has also been credited for their quick thinking.\nEasyJet Transport",

    "text": "Off-duty Jackson Local bus driver saves family's dogs from burning home\nJACKSON TWP. – Todd Morris was enjoying his unexpected day off, running errands and visiting his favorite doughnut shop Dough Co. for a sweet treat before heading back to his township home late Wednesday morning.\nHe spotted smoke as he drove along Traphagen Street NW.\n\"It wasn't chimney smoke,\" Morris said.\nHe realized it was coming from behind Jackson Fire Station No. 2, so he turned down the roadway and pulled up to a home at 3826 Amherst Ave. NW. Smoke and flames were shooting from the windows.\nMorris is familiar with the home and the family living there. As a Jackson Local Schools bus driver, he picks up two children from the house every day. Frigid temperatures had closed school that day so he worried if \"his kids\" were inside the burning residence.\nMuscle memory kicked in and he charged toward the door.\nThe retired Jackson Township police officer immediately dialed the fire station's telephone number — something he had learned during safety lessons in kindergarten decades earlier — and reported the fire.\nJackson Local bus driver rescues dogs from house fire\nHe said he banged on the door and got no response. Morris knew he had to do more. He went into the bi-level home - something he had done before on the job - and called out the children's names.\n\"I was doing a search to find my kids,\" the 1989 Jackson High School graduate said. \"I call them my kids because they are from my bus.\"\nMorris searched downstairs and the upstairs, coming close to flames in the living area. Several times he left to get fresh air before continuing his search.\nEventually, he came across the family's two dogs.\n\"They were sitting at the bottom of the steps with a deer in the headlight look,\" Morris said. He helped the pets, carrying one of them, to safety. He took them to his truck, where they were warm and happy enjoying the doughnuts Morris had bought earlier that day.\nOnce emergency personnel began to arrive, Morris called his wife and told her to bring leashes for the dogs.\n\"We're a big rescue family,\" he added. Morris then phoned the district's transportation secretary to get contact information for the family.\nMorris spoke with the mother, explaining the situation and that he was caring for the family's dogs.\nHe took the dogs - a mastiff mix and shepherd mix - home and cleaned them up. Morris learned one of the dogs had neuropathy and has difficulty walking.\nKnowing that the family's world had been turned upside down, Morris wanted to ease their minds a bit. On Wednesday night, the family picked up their pets. Morris made sure to give them toys, bowls and dog food. The family's pet cat was still missing after the fire.\nThe Army veteran says he was at the right place at the right time. He is hopeful any other neighbor would have done the same thing.\n\"I want to think I've done what every other person would have done when you see a family in need,\" Morris said. \"It's a Jackson neighbor helping a Jackson neighbor.\"\nCause of Jackson house fire unclear\nAs of Thursday, the cause of the fire remained under investigation.\nSeveral 9-1-1 calls were received regarding the fire around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. Callers reported flames could be seen coming from the windows of the home.\nThe home was fully involved when firefighters from Jackson Township, Massillon, Green and Canal Fulton arrived.\nThe family of five was not home at the time the blaze broke out. The parents were at work and the four children were at their grandmother's home, officials said.\nThe three-bedroom bi-level home, built in 1952, sustained heavy damage its interior, roof and walls.\nA GoFundMe account has been created to aid the family and has collected more than $16,500 for the family as of Thursday afternoon. A goal of $22,000 has been set.\nTodd Porter, communication director of Jcakson Local, said the district's family support team and counselors have been in contact with the family. Donations of gift cards for the family can be dropped off at Amherst Elementary School or Jackosn Memorial Middle School.\nReach Amy at 330-775-1135 or amy.knapp@indeonline.com.",
