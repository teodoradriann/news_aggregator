    "title": "Sorry, Politico: You Can't Rewrite Declaration of Independence",
    "text": "Politico reporter Heidi Przybyla, a finalist for journalism’s Pulitzer Prize, thinks she knows the Christian faith better than practicing Christians—and, for that matter, the Declaration of Independence. In an [appearance Friday on MSNBC](https://twitter.com/WadeMiller_USMC/status/1761015125673222572), Przybyla said “Christian nationalists” aren’t to be trusted because, in her words, they don’t believe their rights come from any human or governmental institution, but from God. Here is what Przybyla, a national investigative correspondent for Politico who was a Pulitzer finalist [in 2023](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/08/politico-finalist-draft-opinion-overturning-abortion-rights-00095845) for Supreme Court reporting, said: The one thing that unites all of them … as Christian nationalists, not Christians by the way, because Christian nationalists is very different, is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthy authority, they don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from their Supreme Court, they come from God. Well, news flash, Heidi: Most, if not all, traditional Christians believe that our rights come from God, not from any other entity or human or government institution. But let’s take this a step further. The Declaration of Independence, one of America’s founding documents, states where our rights come from. The second sentence reads: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It couldn’t be plainer. Our rights don’t come from people, politicians, social credit systems, or talking heads attempting to rewrite history. They come from God. Somehow, our Founders had the wisdom and foresight to know that this truth would be questioned again and again. So much so that they thought it was critical to make it the subject of the second sentence of the document declaring the United States of America to be an independent country. Yes, Benjamin Franklin’s writings questioned the divinity of Christ. But about a month before he died, Franklin wrote in a March 1790 letter to theologian Ezra Stiles that it was a “question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now.” He maintained that our rights and freedoms come from God. “Freedom is not a gift bestowed upon us by other men,” Franklin’s fellow publisher, John Webbe, [wrote](https://fi.edu/en/science-and-education/benjamin-franklin/7-things-benjamin-franklin-never-said) in 1736 in Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette, “but a right that belongs to us by the laws of God and nature.” John Adams, who became our second president, held that the bedrock of everything the Founders did was taken from Christianity. “The general principles on which the fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity,” Adams [said](https://christianheritagefellowship.com/christian-quotes-from-the-founding-fathers-2/). “I will avow that I then believed, and now believe, that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God.” Benjamin Rush, another signer of the Declaration of Independence, said that the rights written into the founding documents came straight from God. “I do not believe that the Constitution was the offspring of inspiration, but I am as satisfied that it is as much the work of a Divine Providence as any of the miracles recorded in the Old and New Testament,” Rush [said](https://christianheritagefellowship.com/christian-quotes-from-the-founding-fathers-2/). I honestly hope that Przybyla made her gross mischaracterization out of ignorance. It is no secret that the debate over whether the United States was founded as a Christian nation is a hotly contested one, despite what the Founders said in black and white—even Franklin, who wasn’t entirely convinced of the divinity of Jesus Christ. But talking heads on TV don’t get to define what Christians believe, let alone what the founding documents of our country say. We all know they are trying their best to rewrite American history. We absolutely cannot let them get away with rewriting our religion, too. The Daily Signal publishes a variety of perspectives.

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "I-locks Labbé, fundador de Gondwana, dice estar enamorado de Costa Rica Gondwana se presentará nuevamente en el país el próximo 20 de abril. I-locks Labbé, bajista, compositor y fundador de la banda Gondwana, reside desde hace unos años en Cahuita, Limón; y aunque los otros integrantes de la banda de reggae viven en el extranjero, el músico dice que no piensa irse a otro lugar porque Costa Rica “es un paraíso”. Por este motivo, y para promocionar la gira de la banda, Labbé conversó con Teletica.com sobre los inicios de Gondwana, su música y cómo se enamoró de la zona del Caribe. I-locks, como es conocido por sus fanáticos, explicó que Gondwana fue la primera banda de reggae en Chile, y aunque al inicio fue duro, siempre las ganas de trabajar en su música los alentó. \"Como todo, al inicio de la banda fue difícil, pero con muchas gracias de hacer las cosas, y hacerlas bien. Yo soy el fundador de la banda, era un lugar bastante postergado socialmente, entonces fue muy difícil, pero con las ganas que había y con visión de ser una banda de reggae, se nos fueron abriendo las puertas, poco a poco. \"Pasamos 10 años para poder grabar un disco, pero ocupamos esa experiencia para plasmarlo en los discos y trabajos que hemos hecho\", expresó. Sobre su música, subrayó que vienen cosas muy buenas para la banda, y que les ha ido muy bien con su sencillo ‘Cahuita’, que está dedicado a este “lugar de paz y calidez”. \"Se vienen sorpresas. Estamos trabajando en un disco nuevo, con nuevas canciones, hemos sacado dos 'singles', y dos 'singles' que están dedicados a Cahuita, el primero se llama así literalmente, habla de la bondad y de este lugar maravilloso en que yo vivo. \"Y luego, una colaboración con Collie Bubbz y J-Vibe, en un álbum del Cali Roots. Este álbum estuvo nominado al Grammy, son muchos exponentes del reggae internacionales que participaron del disco, y nosotros participamos con la canción 'Do it right'\", añadió. El fundador de la banda dice estar enamorado de Costa Rica, sobre todo del Caribe, desde la primera vez que visitó el país hace 24 años. \"Nosotros vinimos a tocar en Costa Rica en el año 2002, en el marco de lo que fue el primer festival de Reggae Latinoamericano, en Alajuela. En esa oportunidad, conocí a unas personas que me hablaron muy bien de la zona Caribe, y me invitaron. Pude conocer la bondad, la calidez, el paisaje, la fauna y me enamoré. Ahí fue donde dije: 'Yo quiero vivir acá'. Había estado en Jamaica, se parece, pero me gusta mucho la vibra de Costa Rica, al inicio en Puerto Viejo y ahora que vivo en Cahuita\", indicó. I-locks encontró en este lugar el amor, se casó con la limonense Colette Daly, y actualmente tiene dos hijos. Pese a que el grupo musical es como su segunda familia, ama pasar tiempo en Costa Rica, para disfrutar con los suyos. El artista finalizó extendiendo la invitación al público tico a su concierto el próximo sábado 20 de abril, en el Club Peppers. Las entradas están disponibles por medio de [ e-tickets](https://www.eticket.cr/eventos.aspx?idartista=1122), y el evento dará inicio a las 9 p. m.",

    "text": "In Gorlakhandoddi, Gattu Mandal of Telangana, Muslims forcibly removed a statue of Saint Kanaka Haridas, as reported by Organiser. The statue, which was set to be unveiled on May 22, was installed on private land in Jogulamba Gadwal district in Telangana.\nAs per the report , devotees of the Kuruwa community revere Saint Kanakadas as their family deity. On the day of the unveiling ceremony, the community was doing Puja since 4 am. However, some local Muslims arrived at around 7 am in the middle of the ceremonies and forcibly removed the statue.\nThe local Hindus say that the statue was installed on a private plot of land with all proper documentation, and ownership papers in place. However, some Muslim families in the village opposed it, claiming the statue would obstruct the access path to their houses. The complainants say that there is a road on 2 sides for the houses of the Muslims, but still, they oppose the statue, adding that their main objection was for the installation of a ‘Hindu idol’ near their homes.\nThe local Hindus have named Mohammad, Mabusaab, Imam, Ranju, and Nawab as accused. The local Hindus have also alleged that the administration is surprisingly siding with the Muslims on the issue. The village has 20-25 Muslim families living alongside 800 other families, as per the Organiser report.\nReacting to the incident, Dr. Shashidhar, joint secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad Telangana, said, “The act by Muslims of Gorlakhandoddi is condemnable and state police must arrest and punish the culprits. Every day, the hate crimes initiated by Muslims are increasing, and it seems that the state Congress government is silently supporting these radical Muslims, who are found to be aggressors.\nShri Kanaka Dasa, initially known as Thimappa Nayaka, was born in present-day Karnataka in the days of the Vijayanagara Empire. He was a prominent figure among the saints of the Bhakti movement in the 16th century. He is a revered figure among many South Indian communities. Hindus and is celebrated for his spiritual, and literary contributions to the culture. ",

    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The record-breaking heat in Jacksonville Thursday comes just before Florida's new law impacting heat safety requirements takes effect. The law, House Bill 433 , prohibits municipalities from making employers add new heat protections for workers. Some people support the law and some are against it, but they can all agree it's hot to work outside. “I think this temperature has gone up a degree since we’ve been out here, like in the last five minutes,” said Rebecca Isola, owner of Isolabella Farm in Jacksonville. Isola knows what it’s like to work in the heat. “I’m watering these like twice a day,” she said as she pointed to plants in her greenhouse. Isola and another Jacksonville farmer, Brian Lapinski with Down to Earth Farm, said the heat dictates what they can do and when they can do it. “Yeah, it’s miserable,” Lapinski said about the weather. What Isola doesn't have to worry about as a one-woman-band small business is the law prohibiting municipalities or boards from making employers meet additional heat exposure requirements. Businesses still have to follow Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. Sierra Club President Logan Cross does not support the new law. He said it could cost lives. “Why is it bad to pass any local legislation or anything like that that makes it safer for people to work outdoors?” Cross said. But Tim Conlan, president of the local roofing company Reliant Roofing disagrees and supports the new law. He said it would be impossible to manage crews in different counties without regulations consistent across the state. “We might have a crew in every county every day,\" Conlan said. \"And to be able to manage that would be impossible if there was a different set of requirements county to county.” Conlan said they have weekly and sometimes daily safety meetings and heat is the hot topic right now. The National Weather Service says heat is the biggest weather-related killer. According to the CDC, every year extreme heat kills more than 1200 people in the country. The new law takes effect July 1.",
