    "title": "原油跳涨推动石脑油价格上涨 但需求跟进不足或限制涨幅|原油价格_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "转自：新华财经\n6月13日以来，受地缘政治因素影响，原油价格涨幅在10%左右，对石脑油价格虽有利多，但市场供需面拖累下，石脑油价格涨幅仅在3%左右。后期来看，在原油价格走势偏强的预期下，石脑油价格仍有上涨的预期，但由于需求跟进不足，价格上涨难以持续。\n6月中旬，受地缘政治因素影响，原油价格直线上涨，山东地区汽柴油价格走势相对偏强，石脑油价格受利多因素指引，价格亦出现推涨的局面。但石脑油供需面表现依旧偏弱，从幅度来看，价格涨幅不及原油，且上涨动能略显不足。\n截至6月18日，山东地炼直馏石脑油均值在7150元／吨左右，加氢石脑油均值在7450元／吨左右，相比地缘政治因素发生前涨幅在150-250元／吨水平。\n原油方面，中东地缘局势恶化升级，石油供应担忧加剧，6月13日早盘国际油价快速拉涨，涨幅较大。其中，WTI油价一度涨至76美元／桶上方，涨幅达到12%；布伦特油价逼近78美元／桶，涨幅达到10%。随后市场对地缘事件逐渐消化，原油市场进入短时调整局面，但中东局势没有缓和迹象，欧美原油期货本周再涨超4%。从价格来看，截至6月17日收盘，WTI收在74.84美元／桶，均值环比12日收盘上涨6.8美元，涨幅近10%。\n受原油上涨提振，石脑油价格迎来反弹，但直馏与加氢石脑油的均值上涨幅度仅在150-250元／吨水平，涨幅在2.14%和3.47%，远不及原油价格涨幅。原因在于石脑油市场供需面无好转，且伴随价格上涨，业者谨慎情绪明显，对价格上涨带来阻力。\n供应方面，由于炼厂装置负荷调整，市场直馏石脑油供应减少、加氢石脑油供应增加，尽管直馏石脑供应减少但由于需求欠佳，因此对价格支撑力度不足，供应端对价格利空为主。\n需求方面，海科瑞林、东营石化等企业装置检修，另外胜星化工重整装置负荷调整，直馏石脑油需求减少，同时主营单位观望情绪偏强，对重整料、乙烯料虽有询价但暂无订单，因此除部分炼厂刚需采购以外，其他需求鲜有。汽油价格震荡上涨，给予组分原料市场一定支撑，虽加氢石脑油需求有转好，但在价格上涨后，市场谨慎情绪明显，需求依旧集中在低价货源。\n后期来看，石脑油价格仍有推涨的可能，但暂不看好涨价的持续性。\n原油方面，关注美国方面的消息，是否介入成为核心，假如介入，则原油价格继续走高，美原油不排除涨到80美元位置，否则，假如希望和谈，则原油价格将会回到70美元附近，暂时呈现高波动。短期来看，原油价格走势偏强给予石脑油价格利多指引，炼厂仍有推价的可能。\n供应方面，未来石脑油出货企业的开工负荷暂无变化，且部分企业有计划销售直馏石脑油，供应或有增长预期且目前供应充足，对价格有一定拖累。\n需求方面，东营石化有计划开工，直馏石脑油或恢复采购，但采购量难以提振市场行情，另外，其他企业对直馏石脑油以按需采购为主，市场需求无增量。汽油价格有继续推涨的可能，加氢石脑油谨慎向好，但由于市场供应相对充足，且价差较大，因此低价货源需求或有好转但高价需求将持续清淡。\n综合来看，本次石脑油价格推涨的主要驱动因素在于原油价格拉涨，但从价格涨幅来看，石脑油价格涨幅远不及原油价格涨幅，原因在于市场供需面无好转。6月下半月来看，在原油价格走势偏强的预期下，石脑油价格或有继续推涨的可能，但伴随市场高价抵触情绪出现，且市场供需面无好转的情况下，价格难以持续上涨。\n（作者：张瑾怡， 卓创资讯 分析师）\n编辑：吴郑思",

Q: Tanya, your journey in the music industry has been remarkable. Can you share the inspiration behind your upcoming single, “Honey,” set to release on February 16, 2024? Tanya Nolan: Absolutely, “Honey” is a song that delves into the depths of desire and passion. I wanted to create something sultry and hot, a musical aphrodisiac that invites listeners to savor the taste of love. The lyrics paint an enticing picture of intimacy, offering a seat at my table where passion and connection intertwine. It’s about indulging in emotions and declaring, “Order what you want on the menu, ’cause I’ve been saving you a seat at my table. Get it off until you are full.” It’s a journey of love sweeter than sugar. Q: Your previous hits, including “Pace Yourself,” “No Pressure,” and the chart-topping “Good Woman,” have resonated with audiences worldwide. How does “Honey” differ from your previous work? Tanya Nolan: Each song I create is a unique expression of my emotions and experiences. While “Honey” shares the raw emotion and soulful delivery that my fans love, it introduces a new level of sensuality.

Tanya Nolan: Being an entrepreneur in the childcare services industry has shaped my perspective on life and love. It’s about nurturing and caring for others, and these themes often find their way into my lyrics. My experiences as a businesswoman and a musician are interconnected, allowing me to bring a unique blend of authenticity to my music. Q: In addition to your musical endeavors, you’re actively involved in mentoring, real estate development, and spending time with your wife. How do these aspects of your life contribute to your creativity and overall well-being? Tanya Nolan: Balancing different aspects of my life keeps me grounded and inspired.

    "text": "Sem constatar fundamentação concreta e suficiente para a baixa diminuição da pena em função da confissão espontânea, a ministra Daniela Teixeira, do Superior Tribunal de Justiça, aplicou a um réu tal atenuante no seu patamar máximo de um sexto.\nTJ-RS aplicou atenuante em fração de 1/16; ministra aumentou para um sexto\nNo caso julgado, isso representou uma redução de 16 meses. Com isso, a pena foi estabelecida em seis anos e nove meses no regime semiaberto, além do pagamento de 680 dias-multa.\nA magistrada também determinou o retorno dos autos ao tribunal de origem ou ao juízo das execuções para substituição da pena de prisão por medidas restritivas de direitos.\nO homem foi flagrado com mais de cem quilos de cocaína e condenado em primeira instância a 18 anos de prisão em regime fechado por tráfico de drogas. Posteriormente, o Tribunal de Justiça do Rio Grande do Sul diminuiu a pena para oito anos e nove meses.\nFundamentação inadequada A defesa pediu ao STJ uma diminuição maior da pena, pois considerou que o TJ-RS não fundamentou de forma adequada a aplicação da atenuante da confissão espontânea na fração de apenas 1/16 (o que correspondia a seis meses).\nTeixeira observou que o juízo de primeiro grau e o TJ-RS não aplicaram a atenuante “em cima da pena até ali estabelecida”.\nA relatora também notou falta de “fundamentação concreta e suficiente” para o patamar reduzido de diminuição da pena. Por isso, ela registrou “a existência de constrangimento ilegal” e violação à jurisprudência do STJ.\nAtuaram no caso os advogados Matheus Menna , Osvaldo Duncke e Natália Campos .\nClique aqui para ler a decisão\nREsp 2.110.055",
