    "text": "2024-10-24 19:25:00\nA lack d’ “impartiality” of “multiple controversies and a climate of strong internal conflicts ” a distrust of national authorities… The list of “dysfunctions” reproached by the regional health agency (ARS) to the departmental council of the order of doctors (CDOM) of Reunion is long.\nThese grievances led, on Wednesday October 23, the director general of the island’s ARS, Gérard Cotellon, to sign an order dissolving the CDOM, which brings together around 3,300 practitioners. “An exceptional decision” he explains, in order to “restore the conditions of confidence of doctors in Reunion Island”.\nThis dissolution was carried out at the request of the National Council of the Order of Physicians (CNOM), which had already requested it in 2022, without obtaining it. When contacted, the CNOM refused to communicate further and limited itself to recognizing the exceptional nature of such a decision, only mentioning “two precedents known and confirmed by the order” .\nRetaliatory measure In addition to the violent disputes which have pitted doctors against each other for several years, divided between the majority elected to the CDOM in 2021 and its opposition, two closely intertwined cases have prompted the ARS to react. First, the elections of June 21 aimed at renewing half of the departmental council. A vote finally canceled by the administrative court of Saint-Denis, on October 17, following irregularities.\nThen, the criminal and ordinal complaints launched in 2023 by a general practitioner on the island, Lise François, who accuses her ex-husband, Benjamin Dusang, doctor, of domestic violence, who chaired the CDOM between 2021 and June 2024. During the last ordinary elections, two pairs, including that of Ms. François, were prohibited from running, by decision of the CDOM. The doctor then denounced a retaliatory measure.\nRead also | Article reserved for our subscribers In Reunion, the president of the order of doctors accused of violence by his ex-partner\nAdd to your selections\nThe administrative judges agreed with him, finding that the two pairs had been “irregularly ousted”. In his decree, of which The World has taken note, the ARS considers that the departmental council refused to « with place under control » of the National Council, which had opposed the rejection of the candidacies of the two pairs.\n“Relieved” This election only accentuated the accusations of the CNOM, which already criticized Reunion officials for having suppressed Ms. François’ complaint of domestic violence against her former spouse. Following the complainant’s report, in June 2023, the CDOM “limited himself to auditioning Doctor Benjamin Dusang” even though he presided over order on the island, and never heard the complainant, notes the ARS. The CDOM then chose not to refer the matter to the disciplinary chamber, despite the CNOM’s recommendations.\nYou have 24.11% of this article left to read.

The decision‌ to dissolve⁢ the‍ CDOM has certainly‍ caught many by surprise. Can you tell us what prompted this exceptional measure?\nGérard Cotellon: Thank you for⁣ having me.⁢ The‌ decision to dissolve​ the CDOM was not taken ⁣lightly. We identified ‌significant dysfunctions within the organization, including a lack of impartiality ⁣and a climate rife with internal conflicts. This has bred distrust among medical practitioners on‍ the island and has‌ directly impacted their ability to work collaboratively for the benefit of the community.\nInterviewer: You mentioned a series of grievances against the CDOM. ‌Can you elaborate on some of these issues?\nGérard Cotellon: ⁣ Certainly. Among the main ​concerns ⁤were multiple controversies stemming from divisive disputes amongst doctors and irregularities in the recent elections aimed at renewing​ part of the council. ⁢Beyond⁢ that, we’ve seen escalating tensions tied to personal grievances, particularly involving criminal complaints made by a practitioner. These issues have severely undermined the⁤ council’s credibility​ and functionality.\nInterviewer: The National Council⁢ of ​the Order of Physicians had requested this dissolution back in 2022. Why⁣ was the decision made now?\nGérard ‍Cotellon: The situation has reached ⁣a critical ‍point ⁤where trust ​among doctors in ⁤Reunion Island is‌ at an all-time low.‌ With ongoing ​issues unresolved and the cancellation of ⁢the recent⁤ elections adding fuel to the fire, we⁣ felt⁣ immediate action was necessary to restore a functioning medical authority that can effectively oversee and support our health professionals.\nInterviewer: Dissolving an⁣ organization like the CDOM is a significant step. What are the next steps for the medical community in Reunion Island following this decision?\nGérard Cotellon: Our ‍primary goal is to​ create an environment where‍ doctors can⁤ feel secure and supported. We’ll be working closely with stakeholders‍ to establish a temporary governing​ structure that can ensure continuity of services and oversight. In⁣ parallel, ⁣we will initiate a ⁣transparent process for rebuilding‍ the council in a manner that fosters⁤ equity and impartiality.\nInterviewer: It’s ‍clear this ‌is a pivotal moment⁣ for healthcare ​governance ⁤in Reunion. What message would you like to send to⁢ the medical professionals ‍on the island?\nGérard Cotellon: I want to reassure them that we⁤ are committed to restoring ‌their trust, ​and that we recognize the challenges⁣ they face. ⁤This transition will be handled with care and in ​consultation with the medical community so they can⁣ actively participate in shaping a new, inclusive leadership structure that better ⁣serves everyone involved.\nInterviewer: Thank you, Mr. Cotellon, for shedding⁤ light on this important issue. ‌\nGérard Cotellon: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss⁤ this. It’s ‍an important moment for our healthcare system, and I hope for a ​constructive path forward.\nInterviewer: What steps will you take next to ensure that the medical community in Reunion Island can rebuild trust and move forward successfully?\nGérard Cotellon: Our immediate priority is to establish a provisional authority to oversee the medical profession in Reunion. This body will work to ensure transparency and reinstate impartial governance. We will also provide a platform for open dialogue among practitioners. We believe that fostering communication is essential to healing past divisions and preventing such dysfunction in the future.\nInterviewer: Given the intense conflicts, do you anticipate resistance from some members of the medical community regarding this decision?\nGérard Cotellon: Yes, there will likely be mixed reactions. Change can be difficult, especially after so much turmoil. However, we are committed to demonstrating that this measure is in the best interest of all doctors and, ultimately, the public. It’s crucial that we regain trust and create an environment where healthcare professionals can collaborate effectively.\nInterviewer: There have been allegations of suppressed complaints of domestic violence within the CDOM leadership. How will you address or investigate these serious accusations moving forward?\nGérard Cotellon: Addressing such serious allegations is paramount. We will be launching an independent review to examine these claims and any related issues within the council. It’s essential that all professionals feel safe and supported within their working environment, and no grievance should go unheard or unaddressed.\nInterviewer: Lastly, what message do you want to send to the healthcare professionals and citizens of Reunion Island about this decision?\nGérard Cotellon: I want to reassure both practitioners and the public that our goal is to enhance the integrity and functionality of our healthcare system. By dissolving the CDOM, we are taking a necessary step towards rebuilding a healthcare authority that prioritizes the wellbeing of both medical professionals and the communities they serve. We are hopeful that this move will lay the foundation for a stronger, more cohesive medical community going forward. Thank you for having me.",

    "text": "- By [Vivek Raj](https://english.jagran.com/authors/vivek-raj) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 10:42 AM (IST) - Source:JND Shots were fired on Wednesday morning at the residence of the son of Satish Kumar, president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, in Canada’s Surrey. Following this, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been investigating the incident. According to the police, no injuries were reported during the incident. Constable Parmbir Kahlon, the Media Relations Officer for Surrey Police, confirmed that the targeted residence displayed damage consistent with bullet holes. Surrey RCMP responded immediately to the incident, with officers examining the scene, interviewing witnesses, and canvassing the neighborhood for CCTV footage.

Authorities have appealed for information, including any dash cam footage related to the incident. As of now, the identities of the perpetrators remain unknown, and the Surrey Police have not established any connection between this attack and recent threats received by the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey. In a broader context, concerns regarding security and religious tensions have surfaced, particularly in light of previous incidents. In November, Member of Parliament Chandra Arya shared a video depicting alleged Pro Khalistani supporters in Surrey, expressing intentions to cause trouble at the Hindu Laxmi Narayan Mandir. Arya highlighted the vulnerability of Hindu temples to attacks, citing previous instances of hate crimes targeting the Hindu-Canadian community.

A Hindu temple was vandalised in Canada by extremist elements with Khalistan referendum posters in August this year. In April this year, BAPS Swaminarayan temple was vandalised with anti-India graffiti in Windsor, in Canada's Ontario. Meanwhile, in February, the Ram Mandir in Canada's Mississauga was vandalised with anti-India graffiti. In January, a Hindu temple in Brampton was defaced with anti-India graffiti, triggering outrage among the Indian community.

Photo: Aaron Hughes//World Surf League\nI view the 2024 WSL Finals as an inflection point: the start of the Caity Simmers era. With Carissa Moore stepping away from the tour and 37-year-old Steph Gilmore having been away from competition for a year, Caity Simmers has a realistic runway to start stuffing her trophy shelf with world titles.\nOf course, Caroline Marks may want to have a word with me, but Simmers’ surfing is flat-out electric. She’s the most well-rounded surfer on the women’s tour, no questions asked. Before the 2024 season started, I posed the question of who would fill the power void in the absence of Moore and Gilmore. I (not-so-boldly) predicted it would be the 18-year-old Simmers to step up to the occasion, win the world title, and become the consensus best woman on tour. The first part has already come true, while the next two points could come to fruition this week.\nWith the top seed heading into the finals, Simmers is certainly in the driver’s seat to become the first Californian world champ since Tom Curren in 1990 (yup, it’s been a 34-year drought). And the thing about Simmers is that it really doesn’t matter what the forecast looks like. Her Lower Trestles performance surfing is just as strong against her peers as is her Pipeline tube-riding. There is a strong batch of challengers in Molly Picklum, Tatiana Weston-Webb, Brisa Hennessy, and Marks, but let’s not kid ourselves. The title is Simmers’ to lose.\nAnd speaking of the forecast, it has been the talk of the town. I’ve spent the summer in the devastatingly wave-deprived reefs of Santa Cruz and I cannot recall such a dismal run of surf in recent memory. Many Californians – from north to south – have been throwing around superlatives like “worst summer ever” and the Finals forecast is fairly on brand.\nLooking at the forecast through the end of the event window, September 6-14, there isn’t much to get excited about. Many are already speculating that the event will run the first day possible as Surfline is calling for 3-4+ feet. Friday’s south-southwest swell of 2.8 feet at 14 seconds looks like the best California’s most trafficked cobblestone point will offer. The rest of the window appears to be smaller.\nThe passionate surf fans/trolls who have been complaining about ending the year at Lowers will have plenty of ammunition to keep their keyboards warm. We’ll likely see some heats decided by waist-high waves.\nWhile the conditions shouldn’t phase Simmers, over on the men’s side of the draw, everyone is wondering if John John can get world title number three in the small surf. He’s certainly capable of it, but the opposition is going to be brutal. There’s the hometown hero Griffin Colapinto who will have every San Clemente grom on an e-bike causing a ruckus on the sand. There’s the aerial antics of Italo Ferreira that – when he’s on – is essentially impossible to overcome. Then there’s the all-around greatness of Jack Robinson and the buttery carves of Ethan Ewing. For the men, it’s a toss-up.\nIt would be shameful to see John John relinquish his 3,000-point lead, but the stars are aligning to make such a scenario unfold. To thicken the plot, there has been swirling speculation that he might hang ‘em up after this season. I’m pulling for John John to prove his small-wave non-believers wrong and bring this title home. He deserves it, whether or not this is his last hurrah.\nIf the top seeds take it, 2024 could be a uniquely defining year. Think about it. Caity Simmers wins her first of…4 or 5?… titles, while John John earns his last and potentially goes off in search of perfect waves instead of a life on tour. Or maybe he doesn’t win the title and leaves the Final 5-formatted tour due to disinterest. There are several interesting threads to follow there.\nSomething else that’s on my mind: If the forecast is as lackluster as it appears, how does that affect Lowers’ status on the tour and…drum roll…the Olympics? I can’t imagine they would remove California ocean surfing from the CT, but would a poor showing from Mother Nature sway the organizers at LA 2028 about where to hold Olympic surfing? Maybe. I’ve already said I don’t want an Olympic wave pool , but my opinion means diddly-squat.\nLastly, can we get a repeat of Mick Fanning and Kelly Slater in the booth for finals day? I genuinely enjoyed their combined surf genius last time they took over the broadcast. Anyway, I’m secretly hoping they don’t run on Friday because I’ve got a terribly-timed DMV appointment. But if they do, I’ll be watching the potential dawn of the Caity Simmers era remotely via smartphone as I fill out paperwork – the moment that could make California surfing great again.\n Newsletter Only the best.

    "text": "Being Black and pregnant in America can be a deadly combination. With Black women being twice as likely to die during or soon after childbirth than white women, interventions to improve Black maternal outcomes are urgently needed. Some healthcare organizations are turning to virtual care tools to close the care gaps facing the Black birthing population.\nData highlights a shocking chasm between Black and white pregnancy outcomes in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021, which is 2.6 times the rate for white women.\nThe factors driving this disparity include various social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers to maternal healthcare, such as transportation and income. One California-based health system seeks to break down these barriers through virtual healthcare.\nThe UC Davis Health system is creating a new telehealth program to expand access to prenatal and postnatal care for Black patients.\n\"It's beyond just giving someone a bus ticket,\" said Ijeoma Uche, MPH, co-leader of the telehealth project, in an interview. \"It is truly meeting them where they are on their phone, which is something they use every single day. And there's a sense with telehealth, in general, of how we can truly provide patient-centered care and meet moms where they are.\"\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges has recognized the program with a Telehealth Equity Catalyst Award totaling $27,000. The funds will be used to establish video-based perinatal care for Black patients across the UC Davis network. However, as Uche and the UC Davis team work to launch the program, they must ensure that challenges to virtual care access do not hinder the program's goals.\nBarriers to maternal care access Access to prenatal care, which encompasses prenatal and postnatal care, is essential for maternal and infant well-being.\nIt's beyond just giving someone a bus ticket. It is truly meeting them where they are on their phone, which is something they use every single day. Ijeoma Uche, MPH Co-leader of the telehealth program, UC Davis Health The prenatal period ranges from the moment a person is pregnant to when they give birth, while the postnatal, or postpartum, period extends from childbirth to a few years after, explained Uche, who is also a second-year medical student at UC Davis, and co-founder of the Birth By Us app that offers pregnancy and postpartum care resources for Black birthing people.\nWithin the realm of research, the postpartum period ends a year after childbirth, but in real life, this period can extend further.\n\"It's really interesting because when we talk to mamas and birthing people, they always say that we're forever in postpartum,\" Uche said.\nHowever, she added that there is a greater emphasis on prenatal care than care during the postpartum period in the U.S. healthcare system. This is a significant oversight as Commonwealth Fund data shows that 52% of maternal deaths occur after birth, with 21% occurring between one and six weeks postpartum.\n\"Once you have your baby, a lot of that care then transitions into the newborn,\" Uche said. \"And moms only see their providers once in a six-week period of time. ... Although it's very natural, [giving birth is] still a very intensive experience and procedure, specifically if you get a C-section. Imagine you go in, and you have this big procedure, and then your doctor tells you, 'I'll see you in six weeks.' And now, on top of that, you're going home with a new person that you're trying to learn [to care for] and managing your healing process and this huge transition of your life.\"\nUnless it is a high-risk pregnancy, new mothers are generally left to manage the stressors of the postpartum period on their own. As a result of their new and busy schedules, Uche noted they are less likely to attend their postpartum visits.\nAdd to that the U.S. does not have a mandated maternity leave period. As a result, mothers, especially single mothers, are often not able to take time off from work or find child care to make it to their postpartum appointments, she said.\nThen, there is the issue of health insurance coverage. Most health plans cover birthing people through pregnancy; some continue coverage one year postpartum. However, because the postpartum period extends well beyond a year, new mothers might find it hard to find a plan to cover all their needs.\nThese challenges multiply for women of color. Research shows that Black and Hispanic women have significantly less access to paid leave through their employers or government programs and are more likely to be uninsured than their white and Asian counterparts.\nIn addition to patient-facing barriers, there are challenges on the provider side that influence postpartum care access. As a result of staffing shortages , obstetricians and gynecologists are often overworked and burned out.\n\"Gynecology is such a special art, and it takes so much physically and mentally to go through everything to be an amazing physician for your patient. But in terms of what is set in place to allow them to bring their best self every single day and be able to accommodate all the needs their patients have on time with these guidelines, it is beyond them,\" Uche said.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises that the first postpartum checkup should occur within three weeks. However, patients might be forced to see a new healthcare provider if their current provider is unavailable within that time frame. Uche noted that this means patients start new relationships with their providers after undergoing major life changes to which the provider was not privy.\nUsing telehealth to close maternal care gaps Though telehealth was not a new care delivery modality when the pandemic hit, the public health emergency spurred adoption and utilization to new heights . In the maternal care space, telehealth offers pregnant people a convenient and effective way to connect with healthcare providers.\n\"That opened so many doors, especially as we take into consideration moms who are struggling to find child care or struggling to get the car at a certain time if she's sharing a car or her partner is not there to be able to take care of the needs for her to even [be able to] attend that visit,\" Uche said. \"So, I think that technology within itself has catapulted this sense of access to care.\"\nThe new program at UC Davis Health aims to use telehealth to build more than just a sense of access to care -- its goal is true access to care for Black patients. The program will enable Black patients to participate in postpartum visits through video-based telehealth , alleviating numerous barriers to care access.\n\"Instead of saying you can come in, we can give them the option to have this visit with their provider in the comfort of their home and see if that allows them to attend more visits and be more proactive and active in their own care,\" Uche said.\nThe program not only aims to increase the number of Black patients who attend postpartum visits but also to boost patient satisfaction and make these results sustainable in the long term.\nTo achieve these goals, the UC Davis Health team will track the program's efficacy. James Marcin, M.D., director of the Center for Health and Technology at UC Davis Health, explained that a digital health equity dashboard will be used to monitor not only whether a telehealth visit was successful but also reasons for failure, such as technical issues or a lack of cell service or Wi-Fi among the patients.\nThis tracking is critical because as telehealth utilization grew during the pandemic, it became clear that not all groups had equitable access to virtual care modalities. Race, age, location of residency and primary language all play a role in determining access to telehealth.\nUC Davis Health, which utilizes telehealth systemwide, has taken steps to mitigate these barriers, according to Marcin. For example, the health system has expanded the number of languages available for patient education regarding how to use telehealth.\nAssessing patient needs will be critical to building the program, which is still in the early stages of development. As the UC Davis team works on program development, it is committed to keeping the community's needs front and center, adjusting program protocols as required.\n\"One big thing about just this intervention is that it is something that moms are asking for, and I've always had this saying, 'first you listen, and then you build,'\" Uche said. \"And that's what we're trying to do here. ... It's [about] listening and amplifying the voices of communities that are going through these struggles, [people] who see what works for them and what doesn't work for them. And our job is just to continue to build, listen, reiterate, and then go back to the drawing map if need be.\"\nAnuja Vaidya has covered the healthcare industry since 2012.

It's All Kicking Off\nAnge Postecoglou blamed the tiredness of his injury-ravaged Tottenham squad after they suffered a thumping 4-2 defeat at Brighton on Thursday night.\nA brace of penalties from Joao Pedro and strikes from teenager Josh Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan gave the Seagulls a four-goal lead before a late onslaught from Postecoglou’s side.\nAlejo Veliz and Ben Davies pulled back what seemed like consolations, only for Postecoglou’s side to bombard Brighton with a flurry of shots in the closing stages.\nTottenham had a host of players missing through injury and suspension, with key centre back Cristian Romero ruled out before the game for five weeks and Oliver Skipp missing out after picking up a late knock.\n‘We probably looked a little bit tired,’ said Postecoglou. ‘The lads have put in a hell of a shift over the past few weeks.\nAnge Postecoglou watched his side go four goals down to the Seagulls before a late fightback\nTottenham suffered a miserable night on a night where their makeshift defence was exposed\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n‘We looked leggy and Brighton are always a good side. We hung in there until the end and I can’t fault the effort.\n‘The team continue to show character.\n‘We lacked energy tonight – you could tell that and against Brighton that’s going to cost you.\n‘It’s because we’ve got 10 players injured. You can go to the well so many times, the way we play. The players have given everything. That’s all we can ask from them.’\nBrighton forward Danny Welbeck said: ‘It was a good performance.\n‘The first half was brilliant from us and we played some good football in the second half. We hurt them, we exposed their weakness.’",

    "text": "| ||||||||||||||||||||||\n|\n|\nAporcentaje logra que una víctima de negligencia médica obtenga casi 300.000 euros de indemnización | |||\n| |||\nEl equipo de abogados para negligencias médicas de Aporcentaje ha logrado una El caso ganado por el despacho especialista en negligencias médicas AporcentajeEl despacho especialista en negligencias médicas Aporcentaje representaba a un paciente en procedimiento interpuesto ante un Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Barcelona. El demandante padecía problemas de arritmia cardíaca y se le practicó una intervención quirúrgica consistente en una ablación. Se trata de un proceso que consiste en hacer una pequeña cicatriz en el tejido que controla el ritmo cardíaco para normalizarlo. Para realizarla, se practica una incisión en la ingle por la que se introducen catéteres que van hasta el corazón. Una vez allí, se aplica frío extremo o calor que modifica los tejidos cardíacos causantes de la arritmia. Por tanto, se trata en teoría de un procedimiento menos invasivo y peligroso que la operación a corazón abierto. Lo cierto es que en dos las intervenciones realizadas, el cliente sufrió lesiones, la más importante una lesión en el nervio femoral derecho que le ha provocado importantes secuelas. La sentencia del juzgado de BarcelonaLa sentencia del juzgado de Barcelona señala que el daño en el nervio femoral en la segunda intervención se debió a una compresión extrema en el transcurso de la operación. Asimismo, en ella se reprochan otras actuaciones de los médicos. Se critica que el consentimiento informado fue rubricado por el paciente el mismo día de la intervención y que no se advertía de las patologías que luego sufrió. También se indica que la operación duró más de lo habitual y que hubo de pasar, durante ella, de anestesia local a general. La sentencia estima la responsabilidad del médico y su compañía de seguros, entre otras razones al recaer sobre él la obligación de mantener al paciente en la postura adecuada, más aún en una operación con anestesia general. La sentencia indica que en cualquier caso deberían haberse tomado precauciones adicionales debido a los antecedentes del paciente, quien ya había presentado hematomas. De acuerdo con todo ello, la sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Barcelona condena a los demandados por las lesiones causadas. Entiende que el consentimiento informado no cumplía con los requisitos legales y que se infringió la lex artis, pues no se tuvieron en cuenta los antecedentes del paciente. Como resultado, establece una indemnización para este de 160 806 euros (la pedida inicialmente por Aporcentaje) más los intereses y las costas. En total, son casi 300 000 euros.
