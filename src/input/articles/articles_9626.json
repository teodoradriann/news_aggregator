    "text": "Learn how Shift Up utilized real-world models, cinematic experience, and animal research to create Eve’s enemies. Stellar Blade fans are spending so much time in the demo that Shift Up is getting concerned. This game gets me; so hard at times trying to complete to finish hopefully I'll be able to come out victorious The demo was fun but it will take me some time to get used to the parry and dodge timing. But I’m not going to constantly keep playing the demo. I’m looking forward to playing the full game one day and I’ll get my grind on then. Details regarding the review embargo for Sony Interactive Entertainment and Shift Up's Stellar Blade have been revealed. Two days before launch is fine. Same day as preload and... its only 35 GBs so I don't have to reorganize my who whole library just to fit it on lol. Hopefully the game sticks the landing. Demo was a great time so I'm hoping we're not in for another Hogwarts Legacy type of situation. By that I mean, its flaws don't get swept under the rug just because of the controversy the game doesnt deserve. HL was a solid game overall but at its core, it was an above-average Ubisoft-like from quest structure to a physical edition with an online installation requirement to being riddled with SJW shoehorning. If this game gets good reviews that's best, but if it doesn't or is received as mid, I can't imagine the conversation actually focusing on what the reviewers critique but the reviewers themselves. Not as confident as how far ahead Sony has done on its first party stuff, but at least it’s not this day of bullshit. Cautious confidence lol. I’ll be preordering tomorrow. Demo sold me on it. I already know that IGN France is going to be glowing for this game in their review. Sony is sparing no expense on the promotion of upcoming PS5 exclusive Stellar Blade in Asia, as it’s hired Korean cheerleading sensation Lee Dahye to cosplay as protagonist Eve as part of a meet and greet in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Those who pre-order the game will have an opportunity to attend an event with the Dragon Beauties dancer, who’s one of the most prominent models in Taipei right now. Don't know if it's good taste or not. But kind of afraid of where Sony is going recently. didn't realize this was newsworthy. Imagine getting an announcement for each cosplayer hired to promote a game A strong, independent, successful woman promoting a strong, independent videogame character. What's wrong with that?",

    "title": "The Kirk Gibson Center for Parkinson’s Wellness to Begin Construction",
    "text": "In October, the Kirk Gibson Foundation for Parkinson’s , a foundation lead by former professional baseball outfielder and manager, Kirk Gibson , with the goal of “providing inspiration, hope, and help to those living with Parkinson’s,” has recently announced plans for the construction of The Kirk Gibson Center for Parkinson’s Wellness, a first-of-its-kind center serving the Parkinson’s community, located in Farmington Hills.\nWith 30,000 square feet to work with, the center will provide a variety of programs and activities specifically chosen to help and benefit the Parkinson’s community. These programs range from physical activities such as boxing, active stretching, yoga, pilates, tai chi, and dance, to cognitive improvement exercises like speech therapy, music therapy, and art programs. The facility will also hold educational offerings such as fall safety, kitchen safety, and nutrition.\nEverything offered at the center will be free for all members, but members must first undergo the registration process, Steve Annear , the CEO of the Kirk Gibson Foundation for Parkinson’s, explains.\n“Registration is really important,” Annear says. “The reason is that people with Parkinson’s usually have a unique set of symptoms, and it can affect individuals very differently. What we do is we have classes that are set up according to the classification of mobility and ability of the individuals.”\nDuring a press conference on Oct. 1, Kirk Gibson delved into his main vision for the facility:\n“Opening this Parkinson’s Center is more than just a building, it’s a center of hope for everyone fighting this battle with Parkinson’s,” he said. “Every step forward, every breakthrough we make together, reflects the strength we find in each other. This journey is personal, but it’s also for all those who need to know they’re not alone.”\nThe design team behind the wellness center is none other than the Detroit-based architects at Gensler , and Farmington Hills was chosen as the center’s location due to the area’s large Parkinson’s community.\n“There’s something like 8,000 people with Parkinson’s disease within a 30-minute drive of this location, so it’s a great location from that point of view,” Annear said. “The center will be open to anybody that wants to come, no matter where they live. If they’re somewhere else in Michigan and they want to come down and spend a couple of days, it’s available to anybody that wants to walk through the door.”\nIn the past, such facilities in the United States have been detoured due to funding as the type of group classes offered are not funded by insurance.\n“Throughout the US, the group classes such as these are not funded by insurance, so unless people privately step up and offer these kind of group classes, they just won’t happen,” Annear said. “The gap in care is enormous because there is no insurance, so we feel that, for the people in Michigan, we can step up and provide a facility like this that doesn’t really exist right now and provides that kind of programming.”\nThe Kirk Gibson Center for Parkinson’s Wellness is expected to open in mid-2025 as the foundation continues to raise funds to expand the range of programs planned to be offered by the center.\nFor more information on the Kirk Gibson Foundation for Parkinson’s, visit their website at kirkgibsonfoundation.org — and be sure to check out hourdetroit.com for more on Kirk Gibson and Steve Annear .",

    "title": "Tawny Owl’s Grey Color Helps it to Survive in Cold Environments",
    "text": "A recent genetic discovery has revealed that the pale grey plumage of the tawny owl is linked to crucial functions that aid the bird's survival in cold environments. As global temperatures rise, dark brown plumage is likely to become more common in tawny owls living in colder areas.\nColouration in animals and plants is a biological trait that has long fascinated biologists. The variety of colours has been shaped by evolution to aid in a variety of natural interactions. Colouration can help animals blend into their surroundings to avoid predators or attract a mate and can even be linked to physiological properties conferred by pigments.\nThe tawny owl is a nocturnal bird of prey that can be found in woodlands across Europe and western Siberia and their colour ranges between pale-grey and darker-brown. It is believed that the co-existence of both colour morphs is due to adaptations to their surrounding environment.\nDarker individuals are consistently found in warmer and humid environments, while pale-grey individuals are typically observed in cold, dry, and snow-prone environments, such as northern Europe.\n“Based on this assumption, it has been predicted that the warming climate and snow scarcity may lead to a shift towards darker feather colouration in cold regions that have been dominated by grey owls,” says Postdoctoral Researcher Miguel Baltazar-Soares, who led an international team composed by researchers from the University of Turku in Finland, and the University of Lund and the University of Linköping in Sweden.\nHowever, there have not been decisive links between feather colour polymorphism and different environments until now. In a recent study, the researchers assembled and sequenced the entire genome of the tawny owl for the first time and subsequently screened the genome of 370 tawny owl specimens. The researchers found gene variants that link colour polymorphism and potential adaptations to cold environment.\nThe researchers discovered that the combinations of two genetic variants can predict grey coloration in owls with an accuracy of 70% to 100%. These same genes are also likely involved in biological functions that are crucial for the owl's survival in extreme weather conditions. These functions include energy homeostasis, fat deposition, and control of starvation responses, which may be interpreted as adaptations to local environmental conditions.\nAccording to Dr Baltazar-Soares, the functionality of these genetic variants will need to be further verified in future studies. Nevertheless, these results suggest that these co-occurring colour morphs may be an adaptive response to climate conditions.\nThe article was published in Molecular Ecology.",

Prácticamente desde que se inventó el cine, fueron muchos los realizadores que quisieron adaptar en pantalla los textos de la Biblia y han sido muchas las adaptaciones que han llegado hasta nuestros días y que van desde [la visión personal de Mel Gibson](https://www.elespanol.com/series/cine/20170413/208229490_0.html) a reinterpretaciones como la animada El Príncipe de Egipto. Sin embargo, The Chosen va contra la marea de Hollywood, tratando de diferenciarse desde sus humildes orígenes y poniendo distancia de otras versiones de la misma historia. De hecho, esta ficción creada por Dallas Jenkins es incomparable a todo lo anterior y no sólo ha sido muy bien recibida por la comunidad cristiana, sino que también es considerada como una serie muy entretenida y apta para todos los públicos.

Nació como una ficción que financió el público a través de una plataforma de crowdfunding y ha sido la audiencia quien ha determinado que siga adelante. De esta manera, logró hacerse un hueco en el panorama televisivo, incluso proyectando sus episodios en algunas salas de cine y conquistando a los espectadores, que han seguido depositando su confianza en ella hasta el día de hoy.",

    "text": "THE UK government has agreed to give a £500m (US$651m) grant to Tata Steel to build an electric arc furnace at Port Talbot, though 2,500 jobs will still be lost as the firm presses ahead with plans to shut down the site’s only remaining blast furnace.\nTata Steel will invest £750m in the electric arc furnace, which can produce greener steel using renewable electricity to recycle scrap steel.\nIn January, the\n[company announced plans](/news/tata-steel-puts-2-800-jobs-at-risk-with-port-talbot-blast-furnace-closures/) to close both blast furnaces at the site. These burn coke to produce steel and in doing so emit huge volumes of emissions, making Port Talbot the largest source of CO2 in the UK. One blast furnace has already shut down and the second is expected to close by the end of September.\nConcerns are now mounting that British Steel will imminently follow suit and close its blast furnace in Scunthorpe. This would spell the end of virgin steel production from iron ore in the UK.\nOfficials have warned that if these operations are not protected it puts national security at risk and the ability to construct major domestic infrastructure.\nAlasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary of the Community workers union, said: “Decarbonisation should never mean deindustrialisation, and we will need our steel industry to thrive if we are to create a greener, fairer economy.”\nThe steel industry has warned government must do more to level the playing field with overseas steel manufacturers, noting that UK producers are paying up to 50% more for electricity than competitors in France and Germany.\nGareth Stace, director general of the trade group UK Steel, said: “Steel businesses need competitive electricity prices, access to good quality steel scrap, and fair competition from international trade.”\nBasic engineering for Port Talbot’s £1.25bn electric arc furnace project has been completed, Tata Steel said, and it expects to apply for planning approvals by November and for large-scale work to begin in July 2025.\nOrders will soon be placed for the electric arc furnace and ladle metallurgy furnaces, a new coil box and crop shear for the hot strip mill, a cranes package, and for construction management and civil engineering.\nTV Narendran, CEO of Tata Steel, said he looked forward to the speedy execution of the project and that the “complex and ambitious transformation of Port Talbot has the potential to make the plant one of Europe’s premier centres for green steelmaking.”\nThe electric arc furnace is expected to be operational within three years but will support far fewer jobs – just 500 during construction compared to the thousands that will be lost across the closure of both the site’s blast furnaces.\nUnder the terms of the government’s grant, Tata Steel will need to retain 5,000 employees across UK operations. It currently employs around 8,000, with half at Port Talbot.\nThe government says full-time workers who take voluntary redundancy will receive a minimum of £15,000, a £5,000 “retention” payment, and an offer of paid-for training to gain new skills. Meanwhile, up to 400 staff who faced compulsory redundancy will be offered training, full pay for a month and then £27,000 in pay across the following 11 months.\nBusiness secretary Jonathan Reynolds said that while the terms are an improvement on what was being negotiated by the previous government, he acknowledged the deal “falls short of what would be my ideal”.\nPaul Morozzo, senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said more needs to be done to support cleaner industries. “We urge the government to heed the warnings of the past and invest fully in industries of the future. Proper investment in UK green steel production would help our renewable energy supply chain whilst supporting workers and communities in places like Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, rather than having to rely on polluting imported steel to build wind turbines.”\nThe government has committed to invest a further £2.5bn to rebuild and decarbonise the steel industry and to publish a steel strategy early next year.\nCatch up on the latest news, views and jobs from The Chemical Engineer.

Austrian police said in a statement they were increasing security on churches and Christmas markets given a heightened state of alert. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 24-12-2023 04:10 IST | Created: 24-12-2023 04:10 IST German police said on Saturday they were heightening security at Cologne Cathedral following indications of an attack planned for New Year's Eve and in the wake of government warnings in recent weeks about the rising threat of Islamist violence. The police said in a statement they would use tracker dogs to check the cathedral after evening mass and then close it off. On Sunday, Christmas Eve, they would carry out a security check on all visitors, and recommended they get to services early. Police said they could not elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation. German newspaper Bild earlier reported that security authorities in Austria, Germany and Spain had received indications an Islamist group wants to carry out attacks during the Christmas and New Year festivities. In recent weeks Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has warned of the rising threat of Islamist violence in Germany and elsewhere in Europe as the Israel-Hamas war increases the risk of radicalization. Austrian police said in a statement they were increasing security on churches and Christmas markets given a heightened state of alert. \"Given that terrorist actors throughout Europe are calling for attacks on Christian events, especially around Dec. 24, the security authorities have taken the corresponding protection measures in public spaces,\" the police said. The Spanish Interior Ministry announced at the beginning of December a reinforcement of security measures from Dec. 18 for the Christmas holidays, with the anti-terrorism alert at level 4 or \"high risk,\" as it has been since June 2015.

Han intentado hackear sus redes sociales de Instagram y Facebook desde Venezuela (hecho también denunciado)”, dice el documento. “No están seguras ni protegidas en Chile (…) lo que más las aflige es que se les ha negado cabal acceso al expediente de investigación, pero paradójicamente, las últimas diligencias que reafirman la intervención extranjera y de delincuentes altamente peligrosos del Tren de Aragua y otras bandas en este delito se dieron a conocer en un noticiario de televisión abierta”, agrega. “Su situación es de total agobio, y me han pedido formalmente que la República Argentina considere concederles el refugio. Están en total disponibilidad en el corto plazo”, complementa. El documento fue presentado el pasado 4 de julio y la familia de Ojeda ya estaría en Argentina desde el 1 de este mismo mes. Caso Ronald Ojeda Recordemos que el exmilitar Ronald Ojeda fue secuestrado y posteriormente asesinado en Santiago, en febrero pasado, y algunos sectores han apuntado al Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro de estar detrás del crimen. Desde Venezuela, tanto el gobierno como la fiscalía, han comprometido su colaboración en el caso, aunque de momento no han existido avances significativos, como la captura de personas involucradas en el caso que estarían en dicho país.
