    "text": "A local man killed in a Wednesday highway crash is being remembered.\nAccording to Massachusetts State Police, at approximately 11:20 a.m., the Dartmouth Barracks received a report of a three-car crash involving a tractor trailer on Interstate 195 West in the Town of Dartmouth. The caller indicated that one of the operators was not breathing and that person was declared dead at the scene by Dartmouth EMS.\nThe deceased operator was identified as Anthony Moniz, 62, of New Bedford.\nThose who knew Moniz, like Jimmy James, described a supportive friend who was more than the musical talent that he possessed.\n“I’ve known Tony for many years because of the music scene. Tony was that friend that you might not see all the time, but he’s always there, watching and cheering you on. Tony saw me at my worst of times and encouraged (me) to do better. He always made me feel like I mattered, and I don’t just mean musically but as a human being, which meant more to me than anything. Tony would always greet me with a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I’m gonna miss that. I’m gonna miss his smile.”\nThe cause of the crash, and the circumstances, remain under investigation by Massachusetts State Police.",

    "text": "Ottawa is offering a lifeline to people fleeing an escalating civil war in Sudan if they have relatives in Canada who agree to financially support them. Immigration Minister Marc Miller says this new humanitarian pathway is for both Sudanese citizens and other foreign citizens who lived in Sudan when conflict broke out in mid-April. The program applies to people who are either a child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or sibling to a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. Those relatives have to agree to financially support them, though Ottawa has not said how much money this will require. People must apply for the program and complete the typical security and biometric screening used for visa applicants, such as fingerprinting. Duelling militias began a civil war in Sudan this spring that has caused some five million people to flee, including many who were refugees from neighbouring countries.

    "title": "OSIRIS-REx's Final Haul: 121.6 Grams from Asteroid Bennu - Universe Today",
    "text": "After several months of meticulous, careful work, NASA has the final total for their haul of asteroidal material from the OSIRIS-REx mission to Bennu. The highly successful mission successfully collected 121.6 grams, or almost 4.3 ounces, of rock and dust. It won’t be long before scientists get their hands on these samples and start analyzing them. These samples have been a long time coming. The [OSIRIS-REx](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex) (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) was approved by NASA back in 2011 and launched in September 2016. It reached its target, the carbonaceous Apollo group asteroid [101955 Bennu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu), in December 2018. After spending months studying the asteroid and reconnoitring for a suitable sampling location, it selected one in December 2019. After two sampling rehearsals, the spacecraft gathered its sample on October 20th, 2020. In September 2023, the sample finally returned to Earth. There was some serendipity in the way the final total was reached. Some of it hitched a ride outside of the main sample container. There was some drama, too, as stubborn bolts on the TAGSAM head resisted removal and delayed access to the sample contained inside. Personnel from NASA’s Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) had to design, build, and test new tools that they used to finally open the TAGSAM head and access the sample. For OSIRIS-REx to be successful, it had to collect at least 60 grams of material. With a final total that is double that, it should open up more research opportunities and allow more of the material to be held untouched for future research. NASA says they will preserve 70% of the sample for the future, including for future generations. The next step is for the material to be put into containers and sent to researchers. More than 200 researchers around the world will receive samples. Many of the samples will find their way to scientists at NASA and institutions in the US, while others will go to researchers at institutions associated with the Canadian Space Agency, JAXA, and other partner nations. Canada will receive 4% of the sample, the first time that Canada’s scientific community will have direct access to a returned asteroid sample. Asteroid Bennu was chosen because it’s close to Earth and has been observed extensively. It’s a carbonaceous asteroid, which make up about 75% of asteroids. But it’s also a sub-type of carbonaceous asteroids called a B-type. These are much more uncommon than other carbonaceous asteroids, and scientists think they’re very primitive and contain volatiles that date back to the early Solar System. Researchers around the world have been eagerly waiting for these samples. Bennu is a natural time capsule that holds clues to how the Solar System formed, including Earth. It’s also a [rubble pile asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_pile), and OSIRIS-REx showed that Bennu has over 200 boulders on its surface that are larger than 10 meters. Some of these boulders have veins of carbonate minerals that predate the formation of the asteroid. The “O” in OSIRIS-REx stands for Origins, and that’s one of the things scientists hope to learn more about from Bennu. Will the sample contain any organic compounds that could’ve played a role in the appearance of life? If so, that supports the panspermia theory. Laboratory testing will also show how accurate the spacecraft’s instruments were by comparing the samples to what the instruments told us from orbit around the asteroid. This is invaluable feedback for future missions. But the main scientific value in the Bennu sample concerns what the samples will tell us about the asteroid’s origins. Scientists think that Bennu broke off from a much larger parent body before migrating to the inner Solar System. It could hold clues to that journey and how it changed over time. Astronomers suspect that Bennu is actually older than the Solar System itself. It could hold important clues to the gas and dust in the solar nebula that eventually formed the Sun and all the planets. We already have some early results from the Bennu sample. Initial observations showed that the asteroid contains carbon and water. Carbon wasn’t unexpected since the asteroid is a carbonaceous one. Neither was water surprising since scientists have long thought that asteroids were one of the main ways that Earth got its water. While the OSIRIS-REx sampling mission is over, the spacecraft is still going. It’s in its extended mission now, called [OSIRIS-APEX](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-apex/) (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security – Apophis Explorer.) Its target is the asteroid Apophis, which will have a close encounter with Earth in 2029. The mission will study how the close encounter affects the asteroid, including its orbit and trajectory, and any surface changes that Earth’s gravity might trigger, like landslides. The OSIRIS-REx mission is an impressive display of human ingenuity and cooperation. Once scientists get their hands on the samples, we can expect a stream of fascinating results. Who knows which of our ideas about the Solar System will be confirmed and which ones will be discarded? No matter what we learn, it’s guaranteed to be interesting.",

    "text": "Las acciones asiáticas y los rendimientos de los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense cayeron, mientras que el franco suizo y el yen japonés ganaron fuerza debido a las ofertas de seguridad de hoy, tras los decepcionantes datos de las fábricas estadounidenses que aumentaron la preocupación por el crecimiento económico.\nLa actividad manufacturera estadounidense alcanzó en julio su nivel más bajo en ocho meses, con una caída significativa de los nuevos pedidos. Estos datos se conocieron poco después de que la semana pasada aumentaran las solicitudes de subsidios de desempleo en Estados Unidos hasta alcanzar su nivel más alto en 11 meses.\nEl débil informe del ISM manufacturero inquietó a los inversores, lo que provocó una aversión generalizada al riesgo en los mercados financieros, a pesar de que la Reserva Federal de EE.UU. indicó a principios de semana que podría producirse una bajada de tipos en septiembre.\nLas tensiones geopolíticas también contribuyeron al nerviosismo de los mercados, con noticias de la muerte del jefe del ala militar de Hamás, Mohammed Deif, en un ataque aéreo israelí en Gaza el mes pasado, tras la muerte del líder político del grupo, Ismail Haniyeh, en Teherán.\nEl índice MSCI de acciones de Asia-Pacífico, el más amplio fuera de Japón, cayó un 0,8% en las primeras operaciones asiáticas, reflejando una importante liquidación en Wall Street. Los futuros de las acciones estadounidenses siguieron bajando, con el Nasdaq perdiendo un 0,6% y el S&P 500 cayendo un 0,4%.\nLos economistas de Wells Fargo expresaron su preocupación por las prolongadas dificultades del sector manufacturero, señalando que diversas medidas de actividad han alcanzado niveles no vistos desde que comenzó la pandemia, sin el beneficio de unos precios más bajos.\nEn Japón, el índice Nikkei se desplomó un 5%, cayendo por debajo de la marca de los 37.000 puntos por primera vez desde abril, lo que supone una pérdida semanal superior al 3,5%. En ello influyó en gran medida la fuerte apreciación del yen tras la subida de los tipos de interés por parte del Banco de Japón a su nivel más alto en 15 años y sus planes de ralentizar la compra de bonos.\nEl yen avanzó un 0,15% hasta 149,13 por dólar, apuntando a una ganancia semanal del 3%, con los flujos de seguridad del viernes reforzando aún más su subida.\nEl franco suizo alcanzó su nivel más alto desde principios de febrero, a 0,8720 por dólar, beneficiándose también del sentimiento de aversión al riesgo.\nComo reflejo de la preocupación por la ralentización de la economía estadounidense, el rendimiento de los bonos del Tesoro a 10 años cayó a su nivel más bajo en seis meses, el 3,9440%, ya que los inversores buscaron la seguridad de la deuda pública. El rendimiento a dos años, que suele indicar las expectativas de tipos a corto plazo, cayó a su nivel más bajo desde mayo de 2023 en el 4,1090%, la última vez que se vio fue en el 4,1215%.\nLos futuros del mercado sugieren ahora una posibilidad del 29% de una reducción de 50 puntos básicos por parte de la Fed en septiembre.\nLa atención se centra ahora en el informe de nóminas no agrícolas de EE.UU. que se publicará hoy para conocer mejor la situación del mercado laboral y de la economía en general. El director de investigación de Pepperstone destacó la importancia de los datos de nóminas para los operadores de renta variable con sede en Asia, que vigilarán el impacto de la sesión estadounidense en la apertura del mercado del lunes.\nEn cuanto a la evolución de las divisas, la libra esterlina bajó ligeramente hasta 1,2724 dólares, tras el recorte de los tipos de interés por parte del Banco de Inglaterra, que el jueves se situaron en máximos de 16 años. El dólar australiano y el neozelandés cayeron un 0,2%.\nLos precios del petróleo experimentaron una modesta subida en medio de la renovada preocupación por las tensiones geopolíticas que podrían interrumpir el suministro, con el crudo Brent a 79,83 $ el barril y el crudo estadounidense a 76,64 $ el barril.\nEl oro al contado subió un 0,2%, hasta 2.450,62 dólares la onza, ya que los inversores buscaron activos refugio tradicionales.\nReuters colaboró en la elaboración de este artículo.
