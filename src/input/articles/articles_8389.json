    "title": "El regreso de las lluvias causa inundaciones en la Trinchera y la avenida de Vigo en Ferrol",
    "text": "Después de prácticamente diez días ininterrumpidos de sol y tiempo seco , la lluvia ha vuelto a la comarca de Ferrol. Y lo ha hecho con copiosas precipitaciones que han comenzado a causar inundaciones. Lo ha hecho en puntos habituales del callejero urbano de la ciudad. Y en la mañana de este viernes, los bomberos ferrolanos tuvieron que acudir para solucionar anegamientos en la carretera de la Trinchera . Sin embargo, a diferencia de ocasiones anteriores, el problema más grave se produjo en una zona cercana a la nueva rotonda construida para conectar la FE-11 con la avenida de As Pías (FE-14), justo en el límite con el tramo donde no se actuó. El agua anegó por completo la calzada en sentido polígono de A Gándara, que quedó cubierta por una profunda balsa, y que hizo que tuviesen que movilizarse la Policía Local y los bomberos . Aunque la situación dificultó la circulación , la rápida actuación evitó que tuviese que cortarse al tráfico la carretera en este punto. La inexistencia de arquetas y el cambio de la pendiente que trajo consigo la humanización de As Pías en este punto se apuntan como posibles causas de lo sucedido en una vía de titularidad estatal . El Concello de Ferrol puso en conocimiento del Ministerio de Transportes lo ocurrido, para que se adopten las pertinentes medidas. Precisamente, la formación de grandes charcos en la margen de la carretera donde se produjo la inundación ya había sido motivo de queja hace semanas por algunos usuarios de la vía.\nAdemás, otro punto de la Trinchera, cercano a la rotonda de Alcampo, es desde hace muchos años, zona recurrente de inundaciones cuando arrecian las lluvias.\nEste viernes por la mañana los bomberos también realizaron un desplazamiento hasta la avenida de Vigo , en Esteiro, en las cercanías del aulario del campus ferrolano, donde el agua también formó una balsa sobre la calzada.\nSegún los datos de Meteogalicia , en la estación del CIS de A Cabana se acreditaba pasadas las cinco de la tarde un registro de lluvia acumulado de 70,7 litros por metro cuadrado , lo que la convierte en una de las jornadas más lluviosas del último año.\nSegún la previsión meteorológica de este organismo, lloverá hasta pasada esta medianoche. Y para el sábado , los modelos predictivos prevén una tregua, con una mejoría del tiempo que se mantendrá hasta última hora de la tarde. A partir de ahí, la jornada del domingo , 5 de enero, en la que están previstas la mayor parte de las cabalgatas, ya depara lluvias , con algún intervalo de nubes y sol, y temperaturas suaves que llegarán en la zona a los 17 grados, según Meteogalicia.",

    "title": "How many Corydoras in a 5 gallon?",
    "text": "How Many Corydoras in a 5 Gallon? Real talk, folks? Keeping Corydoras catfish in a 5-gallon tank is generally not recommended . While it might be technically possible to squeeze in a couple of the smallest pygmy cory species under very specific conditions and only when they are juveniles, it’s far from ideal and often leads to stressed, unhealthy fish. Corydoras are social creatures that thrive in groups, and a 5-gallon tank simply doesn’t offer enough space for a proper school to exhibit their natural behaviors. Let’s delve deeper into why this is the case and explore more suitable tank sizes for these delightful bottom-dwellers. It is extremely important to consider the well being and requirements of any living thing that you are planning to keep in any enclosed habitat.\nWhy 5 Gallons Isn’t Enough Corydoras, despite their small size, are active fish that need room to explore and forage. A 5-gallon tank provides extremely limited swimming space, which can lead to stress and territorial issues, even amongst these peaceful fish. Here’s a breakdown of the primary concerns:\nSchooling Behavior: Corydoras are happiest in groups of at least 6 or more , allowing them to feel secure and exhibit their natural schooling behavior. A 5-gallon tank is far too small to comfortably house even a small school of pygmy corys once they mature.\nWater Quality: Small tanks are notoriously difficult to keep clean. Fish waste and uneaten food can quickly degrade water quality, leading to ammonia and nitrite spikes that are toxic to fish. Maintaining stable water parameters in a 5-gallon with multiple fish requires frequent water changes and meticulous maintenance, which can be challenging even for experienced aquarists.\nStress: Confined spaces cause stress in fish. Stressed fish are more susceptible to disease and have shorter lifespans. The lack of space to escape, explore, and establish territories can significantly impact their well-being.\nGrowth: While you might purchase juvenile corydoras, they will grow. Even pygmy species need more room as they mature to their adult size. Cramped conditions can stunt their growth and lead to deformities.\nOptimal Tank Size for Corydoras For most Corydoras species, a 20-gallon long tank is generally considered the minimum recommended size to comfortably house a school of 6 or more . This provides adequate swimming space, allows for proper filtration, and makes it easier to maintain stable water parameters. For larger species, such as Bronze Corydoras, a 30-gallon or larger tank would be more appropriate.\nExceptions: Pygmy Corydoras While generally not recommended, very experienced keepers might be able to temporarily house a small group (3-5) of Pygmy Corydoras (Corydoras pygmaeus, Corydoras habrosus, or Corydoras hastatus) in a heavily planted 5-gallon tank as juveniles with very frequent water changes . Even then, this is a temporary solution, and they should be moved to a larger tank (at least 10 gallons) as they grow. It’s important to remember that just because something can be done, doesn’t mean it should be done. Prioritize the well-being of the fish above all else.\nConsider the health of our ecosystem; the well being of our local water systems are closely tied to how we treat all living things. Understanding these connections can lead to better decisions overall, for both animal and the earth’s sake. The Environmental Literacy Council offers excellent resources that can enhance our understanding of these vital interactions.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Corydoras and Tank Size Here are some frequently asked questions to help you further understand the needs of Corydoras catfish:\n1. What is the smallest Corydoras species? The smallest Corydoras species include:\nPygmy Corydoras ( Corydoras pygmaeus ) Dwarf Corydoras ( Corydoras hastatus ) Habrosus Corydoras ( Corydoras habrosus ) These species typically reach a maximum size of around 1 inch (2.5 cm).\n2. How many Corydoras should I keep together? Corydoras are social animals and should be kept in groups of at least 6 individuals to thrive. Larger groups are even better.\n3. Can I mix different species of Corydoras? Yes, you can often mix different Corydoras species in the same tank. They will frequently school together. However, ensure that all species have similar temperature and water parameter requirements.\n4. What tank conditions do Corydoras need? Corydoras prefer:\nSoft, sandy substrate: This allows them to forage naturally without damaging their barbels. Heavily planted tank: Plants provide hiding places and help maintain water quality. Good filtration: To keep the water clean and healthy. Stable water parameters: Aim for a pH of 6.5-7.5, a temperature of 72-78°F (22-26°C), and low levels of ammonia and nitrites. 5. What do Corydoras eat? Corydoras are omnivores and will eat a variety of foods, including:\nSinking pellets: Specifically formulated for bottom-feeders. Wafers: Algae wafers and other types. Live and frozen foods: Such as bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. Leftover food: They will scavenge for uneaten food on the bottom of the tank. 6. Do Corydoras need a heater? Yes, Corydoras are tropical fish and require a heater to maintain a stable water temperature within the recommended range.\n7. Do Corydoras need a bubbler or air stone? While not strictly necessary if your tank has good surface agitation, an air stone or bubbler can help increase oxygen levels in the water, which is especially beneficial in heavily planted tanks or tanks with a high bioload.\n8. Are Corydoras sensitive to medications? Yes, Corydoras are sensitive to some medications, particularly those containing copper. Always research the potential effects of medications before using them in a tank with Corydoras.\n9. How long do Corydoras live? With proper care, Corydoras can live for 5-10 years or even longer , depending on the species.\n10. What fish can I keep with Corydoras? Corydoras are peaceful and get along well with a variety of other community fish, such as:\nTetras Rasboras Guppies Platies Danios Avoid keeping them with aggressive or territorial fish that may bully them. Panda corys can also be a great option for tanks where you can mix other types of cory.\n11. Do Corydoras clean the tank? While Corydoras do help keep the tank clean by scavenging for uneaten food, they do not eat algae and are not a substitute for proper tank maintenance. You still need to perform regular water changes and clean the substrate.\n12. Why are my Corydoras swimming to the top of the tank? Corydoras may swim to the top of the tank for several reasons, including:\nLow oxygen levels: Check your water parameters and ensure adequate surface agitation. Poor water quality: Perform a water change and test your water for ammonia and nitrites. Disease: Observe your fish for other signs of illness and treat accordingly. Natural behavior: Corydoras will occasionally dart to the surface to gulp air, which is normal behavior. 13. What kind of substrate is best for Corydoras? A soft, sandy substrate is ideal for Corydoras as it allows them to forage naturally without damaging their sensitive barbels. Avoid sharp or coarse gravel that can injure them.\n14. Do Corydoras eat plants? Corydoras do not typically eat healthy, established plants. However, they may nibble on decaying plant matter or algae growing on plants.\n15. How do I breed Corydoras? Breeding Corydoras can be challenging but rewarding. It typically involves providing them with a cool water change, a spawning mop or other suitable surface for laying eggs, and separating the eggs from the parents to prevent them from being eaten.",
