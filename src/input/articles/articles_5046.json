    "title": "Old Favourites, New Classics: Lauren Rouse’s Top Games of 2023",
    "text": "Last year, [my GOTY list](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/12/lauren-rouse-top-games-of-2022/) took a lot of influence from what I’d learned from each of the games I’d played and I’d like to do something similar this year. Looking at the games industry more broadly in 2023, there’s a clear takeaway: for some it’s been the best year, for others its been the worst. It’s a joy to see the public absolutely embrace some of these excellent 2023 releases, but it’s been marred by a lot of the hardships the people who make those games have experienced. If there’s any silver lining out of this, it’s that there are a lot of [great projects in development right now](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/12/most-anticipated-games-2024/) that we can only hope will employ some of the talented creatives out there who have been in the firing line. Speaking more personally, my 2023 hasn’t been as big of a gaming year as it has for others. I never have as much time to play video games as I would like and therefore you may be shocked to find a GOTY list that does not include Baldur’s Gate 3 nor Tears of the Kingdom (I’ll get to them one day, I swear). Working as closely with games as we do I think there’s always a certain pressure to constantly be playing the latest greatest thing, but if there’s something I’ve taken away from this year it’s that returning to a comfort game or taking a minute to go back and experience a title you missed is never going to be wasted time. They all have something to teach us. What this list includes is a mix of titles, both released this year and in the past, that I’ve enjoyed playing in 2023. Blanc Something I don’t get time to do enough of is play couch co-op games with friends, but while on holiday earlier this year I had the chance to do just that, and Blanc was the game that rose to the occasion. The lovely little black and white animated indie is from French developers Casus Ludi and puts you and your fellow player into the shoes of a wolf cub and deer fawn. These unlikely friends find themselves separated from their families in a snow storm and must work together to find their way home. Like other co-op games, each character has unique abilities that allow you to progress, forcing you and your companion to work together to solve puzzles. Blanc is a short and sweet experience with a beautiful art-style and two of the most adorable characters that is perfect for bringing friends together. Uncharted 2 As a byproduct of a video game book club [that we do on my podcast Controller Club](https://open.spotify.com/show/6eAkyalUckNzceQGoJwumw), I often find mysel playing older games for the first time, which includes my journey playing through the Uncharted games. This year, it was Uncharted 2, which I felt was a significant step up from the first game. One of my biggest joys about playing through this franchise so long after its release has been seeing the line of progression between games. Uncharted 2 introduces so many of the mechanics that Naughty Dog has become known for, from stealth encounters to blockbuster set pieces, and while I will forever hate the final boss fight in this game, I am wholeheartedly on the ride for Nathan Drake’s story. Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores Horizon Forbidden West was my game of the year in 2022 and I was incredibly pleased that its DLC, Burning Shores, lived up to those standards. Set within the wasteland of what was once Los Angeles, Burning Shores is packed with dazzling apocalyptic recreations of our most modern pop culture locations. Paired with that is the very human story of Aloy who sees real growth as a character in this chapter and manages to finally open herself to real connection. Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores continued to prove it is one of the most beautiful-looking games around, but it was paired with an equally nice story. For me it really rammed home the notion that DLC chapters can still be seminal experiences. Burning Shores also marks one of my first [video game reviews for Kotaku](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/04/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-review/), so it’ll always be that extra bit special for me. Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical Stray Gods is an astounding achievement for a first-time studio. Hailing from Melbourne, Summerfall Studios managed to push the envelope, creating something that uniquely blends genres, stuns with its art style and employs some of the most talented voice actors in the business. The music is catchy too. The further you get into Stray Gods, the more you realise what a miracle it is. The effort that has gone into its branching narrative and dialogue trees, its plot twists, turns and endings, and its plethora of suave Greek mythology characters that could rival those of Hades is simply incredible, and that’s before you add in the musical numbers. This one reminded me of the incredible talent we have in our local games industry. The Last of Us Part 1 and Part 2 [I’m a The Last of Us apologist](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/09/the-last-of-us-day-lets-revisit-what-the-game-means-to-people/), it’s true, but some of my most significant personal gaming moments this year happened while playing The Last of Us Part 1 or 2. It began when I decided to replay The Last of Us alongside the weekly episode drops of the HBO TV show. It was this process that truly made me appreciate how good of an adaptation The Last of Us is – in some places even better than the games – which was so gratifying as a long time fan of the franchise. Following the end of season 1, I found myself in a TLOU void, so I decided to put myself through the pain of The Last of Us Part 2, for the first time since its release in 2020. As it turns out- it’s still pretty traumatic! But this playthrough ended up being bittersweet because later in the year I visited Seattle for the first time and was able to walk through the real locations I’d only ever explored in a video game. The Last of Us 2 already has one of the most emotional stories, but being able to physically be in the same place as Ellie and Abby really hit different. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild While everyone was obsessing over Tears of the Kingdom this year I decided to see what all the fuss was with this Breath of the Wild game. And hey, it was pretty good! This game was my companion during my wisdom teeth recovery this year and what a wonderful companion it was. Running around the glorious fields of Hyrule, cooking a bunch of food recipes I couldn’t hope to eat at the time really helped me forget the painful situation I was in. I still haven’t finished the game but I’m definitely on the bandwagon. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty In my [2020 GOTY](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/12/lauren-rouses-favourite-games-of-2020/) roundup I said that Cyberpunk 2077 would have a place on my list next year. Well, it came a little bit later than expected, but in 2023 Cyberpunk is definitely a game worthy of this ‘best of’ list. I’ll be honest, even in 2020 I found Cyberpunk 2077 to be very enjoyable. I was fixated by its futuristic cityscape and the its ensemble of well rounded side quests and characters. There were bugs, yes, but I could see through them. This year, it’s clear that Cyberpunk 2077 evolved into the game it was supposed to be three years ago. It’s in large part thanks to the addition of the Phantom Liberty DLC, which is possibly the best quest the game has to offer. The story places you in an espionage thriller, where you meet a number of intriguing new characters and must decide which side to take. Phantom Liberty is one of those stories that really engages you in the action with its selection of morally grey decisions, which reminded me just how immersive a good RPG can be. Cyberpunk 2077’s latest success is also due to the commitment of the CD Projekt Red devs, who have continued to back this project even during its darkest hours. In a year marred with so many struggles, it was nice to see a real redemption arc. Hopefully, there are more of those to come. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 If I have to put a label on my favourite game of the year, it would go to Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. It helps that the original game was already pretty incredible, but to follow up such a game with something that was on the same level, if not better, is a real achievement. Spider-Man 2 provided everything the doctor ordered: sleeker graphics, a larger world to explore, new combat abilities and a new chapter with beloved characters. It continued to appease my Marvel appetite by riffing on comic book canon to create a narrative that was familiar but fresh, with new gameplay mechanics that pushed the boundaries of the PS5. There is nothing I enjoyed more this year than whipping around New York in those web wings. It’s also a game with personality that is born out of all those little details the developers have taken time to include with such care. From the unique design of the spider-bots to Miles and Peter’s little interactions when they pass each other in the street, Spider-Man 2 has such style and flair, and it really embodies everything that makes the Spider-Man character so great. I can’t wait for whatever Insomniac [does with it next](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/06/marvels-spider-man-3-spider-verse-game/).

    "text": "El Universal Critican a Walmart por vender plantas anticristianas para Año Nuevo Leer todo el artículo El Universal 28 de diciembre de 2023, 5:32 p. m. · 2 min de lectura\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO, diciembre 28 (EL UNIVERSAL).- Una mujer se volvió viral en redes sociales, luego de criticar a la tienda Walmart por vender \"plantas anticristianas\" en un \"país cristiano\" para la celebración de Año Nuevo.\nPor medio de la plataforma X, el usuario @ZuritaCarpio compartió el video donde se aprecia a una mujer lanzar una fuerte crítica a la famosa tienda departamental por su artículo para fin de año, sin especificar la sucursal.\n\"Estoy viendo estas cosas, fíjense, eh, en un país cristiano, unos elefantes con la trompa para arriba, con una planta y trae unas monedas, dice que es la planta de la abundancia, pero esto es totalmente anticristiano\", expresó la mujer.\nAunado a ello, señaló que la tienda es parte del nuevo gobierno globalista. \"Un Walmart que es parte del nuevo gobierno mundial globalista, parte de estas corporaciones, siempre vendiendo cosas en contra del cristianismo, siempre fomentando muchísimo el Halloween y toda la serie de descristianización\".\nFinalmente, aseveró que \"a lo único que no se han atrevido es a poner cosas Queer y LGBT para la ropa de los niños, no lo dudo que ya estén haciendo aquí esto\".\n----¿Cuánto cuestan las plantas de la abundancia en Walmart?\nDe acuerdo con el sitio de Walmart, la planta de la abundancia con maceta de elefante ronda un precio de 149 pesos; sin embargo, actualmente se encuentra agotado el producto.\n----¿Para qué sirve la planta de la abundancia?\nLa planta de la abundancia, también conocida como planta de jade o árbol de jade, es una planta suculenta de origen africano que se caracteriza por sus hojas carnosas y redondas, que se asemejan a monedas. Esta planta se ha asociado tradicionalmente con la prosperidad y la buena fortuna, y es por ello que se suele colocar en el hogar o en el lugar de trabajo para atraer estas energías positivas.\nSegún el Feng Shui, la planta de la abundancia debe colocarse en la esquina sureste de la habitación, que es la zona de la riqueza y la prosperidad. También se recomienda colocarla en un lugar con buena iluminación, pero evitando la luz directa del sol.\nAdemás de sus propiedades simbólicas, la planta de la abundancia también tiene algunos beneficios prácticos. Es una planta relativamente fácil de cuidar, ya que requiere poca agua y luz. También es una planta muy resistente, por lo que puede sobrevivir en condiciones adversas.\nMÁS POPULARES Mycobacterium abcessus, bacteria que padece Toño Mauri El Universal · 2 min de lectura Cher solicita la tutela legal de su hijo Elijah El Universal · 2 min de lectura Cómo la medicina moderna cambió el estado de salud de Michael Schumacher, según su hermano Ralf LA NACION · 3 min de lectura La extrema medida a la que acudió Matthew Perry para dejar de consumir drogas, según una exnovia LA NACION · 3 min de lectura Silvia Pinal fue hospitalizada: los detalles de su crisis de salud People EN ESPAÑOL · 1 min de lectura",

    "text": "在新能源领域，汽车动力电池的“退役潮”越来越近。有预测称，2025年全国动力电池退役量将达78万吨，2027年达105万吨，2030年达230万吨。\n动力电池的退役潮，也是回收行业的风口，业界正加速布局。有报道称，目前我国电池回收相关企业注册数量逐年增长，目前已达17.2万家。\n对此，上海市政协委员与多位专家学者建议，上海应抓住退役动力电池回收行业机遇期，争当这一领域的技术输出者、标准制定者、行业引领者。\n机遇\n在业界看来，动力电池“退役潮”是一个可预期的风口。\n近十年来，我国新能源汽车实现了销量从万辆级到千万辆级的飞跃。据中国汽车工业协会数据，2014年我国新能源汽车销量约为7.5万辆，2016年约为50.7万辆，到2024年增长至1286.6万辆。\n作为新能源汽车的核心部件，动力电池使用寿命多在8年左右。因此动力电池的退役数量，必将随我国新能源汽车的销量共同飞跃。\n回收行业的重要性，还有赖于动力电池“资源—环境—安全”的三重属性。\n2025国际退役动力电池风光组件资源循环利用大会近日召开，清华大学深圳国际研究生院副教授周光敏介绍，汽车动力电池主要有三元电池和磷酸铁锂电池两类，锂、镍、钴、锰等金属资源含量高，有“城市矿山”之称。每循环利用1万吨退役电池，可减少开发原生矿产2.4万—5万吨。回收利用的经济性也很高，以锂金属为例，原生锂矿中的锂含量仅有0.8%—1.4%，退役电池中的锂含量则普遍超4%。\n由于动力电池中很多元素有污染性，回收利用还关乎生态环境保护。“退役电池若处理不当，每1千克电池可污染6万升水，或污染1平方公里土地50年。”\n井冈山大学校长罗旭彪表示，我国动力电池相关的多种资源对外依存度高，发展回收行业能有效缓解战略资源依赖的矛盾。2024年，我国回收了碳酸锂8.3万吨、镍14.5万吨、钴2.9万吨，满足了锂、镍、钴各20%、25%、11%的需求。\n此次，回收有助于动力电池行业应对原材料价格波动。近年来，动力电池相关原材料价格震荡，2022年11月，均价每吨约5万—12万元的碳酸锂一度跳涨至每吨近60万元。\n因此，动力电池回收正成为一个越来越被看好的新兴行业。\n2018年，《新能源汽车动力蓄电池回收利用管理暂行办法》发布实施，工信部已先后发布5批次共计156家废旧动力电池综合利用“白名单”企业。\n宁德时代董事长曾毓群曾表示，宁德时代已实现对镍、钴、锰材料高达99.6%的回收率，对锂的回收率也达到91%。他预计，宁德时代到2042年将不再开采新矿产资源，全部依靠回收资源进行制造。\n挑战\n可预期的风口，使得如今这条赛道上已挤满了太多“抢跑者”。\n有数据显示，我国现存的17.2万家电池回收相关企业中，超六成企业于3年内成立。2021年相关企业注册2.76万家，2022年注册4.35万家，2023年注册4.64万家，2024年注册4.27万家。\n“现在买设备的，都是买回去放着等风口。”一家动力电池回收设备生产企业的销售经理告诉记者，目前由于设备投资成本、原料采购成本较低，环保要求也较为宽松，企业大多在提前布局。“风口来了，我家设备也不能按现在价格卖了对吧？”\n当前，动力电池回收产能过剩问题相对突出。有报道预测，当前我国电池回收年产能达到380万吨，远超动力电池的年退役量。有从业者认为，这也导致了企业回收价格过高、利润微薄，甚至有“面粉比面包贵”的现象。\n华友循环产业集团运营总监高威乔还关注到，由于产业尚属发展初期，相关政策文件以鼓励、引导为主，缺乏强制性约束。这导致当前市场不够规范，有“白名单”企业拼不过“黑作坊”的现象。\n不少非合规企业成本低，采用抬高回收价格的方式获取资源；合规企业在厂房、设备、环保处理等方面投入较高，反倒缺乏竞争优势。这也使得部分安全环保标准严格、回收技术先进的企业原材料匮乏、开工率不足，盈利状况堪忧。\n2024年12月，工业和信息化部发布《新能源汽车废旧动力电池综合利用行业规范条件（2024年本）》。《规范条件》要求企业在冶炼过程中，锂回收率从85%提高至90%，电极粉料回收率不低于98%，杂质铝含量需低于1.5%等，引导企业强化技术创新，提升工艺水平。同时提出企业应建立产品可追溯、责任可追究的质量保障机制，增加再生利用产品强制性标准要求，进一步提升综合利用产品质量。\n上海电力大学环境与化学工程学院副院长时鹏辉认为，随着市场规模扩大，相关规范性文件必将进一步健全，动态监管和事中事后管理也将进一步强化，推动动力电池回收行业高质量发展。\n引领\n上海是中国新能源汽车的重点发展地区，截至2023年末，上海新能源汽车保有量达128.8万辆，排名全球城市第一。\n上海市政协委员、上海电力大学原校长李和兴认为，上海未来两年将进入动力电池退役高峰期，建议抢抓电池回收行业机遇期，争当这一领域的技术输出者、标准制定者、行业引领者。\n在政策法规层面，强化地方政策支持。制定适应上海市实际的地方性政策法规，形成强制性回收机制，建议借助《上海市生活垃圾管理条例》的成功经验，推出《上海市退役动力电池回收管理办法》。同时，完善激励约束机制。针对符合规范的回收利用企业，给予资金、税收减免等政策支持。\n在管理机制层面，推进区域协同管理。构建长三角区域动力电池回收联动机制、整合资源共享平台。依托上海的交通和产业优势，建设全国示范性的退役动力电池回收中心。构建信息化追溯系统、优化回收网络布局。\n在技术突破层面，支持绿色高效回收技术研发，开发循环利用新模式，以技术创新引领行业发展。\n比如，清华大学核能与新能源技术研究院研究员徐盛明介绍，当前退役动力电池的综合利用有梯次利用和直接回收两条主要途径：对于健康状况较好的电池，对其进行重组，用于一些低要求领域如电动自行车等；对于健康状况较差的电池，经过预处理拆解，然后采用火法、湿法或再生工艺回收。两条主要途径之外，还有一条直接修复的新途径。\n据介绍，直接修复技术能充分利用材料原有晶格结构修复受损材料，相比传统回收方法能耗更低、温室气体排放更少。目前，这项技术已在部分企业投入使用，深圳一家磷酸铁锂直接修复企业近期已将生产线建成投产，年产能4万吨，目前处于满产状态。\n李和兴还建议，上海加速设立技术试点项目，在重点区域设立动力电池回收利用示范工程，集中测试并推广先进技术和新型商业模式，为全国提供经验借鉴。\n比如，2023年4月，上海首家“产学研”一体化的动力电池无害化处理企业——上海动力电池循环利用中心在嘉定区揭牌。据报道，将采用自主研发的全自动退役锂离子电池带电拆解分选成套装备，能耗、效率等指标均处于领先水平。中心的成立有利于汇集上海本地动力电池回收处理力量，推动行业标准的形成和实施，为上海探索出一条更加可行有效的动力电池循环利用道路。\n或许，这样的尝试可以更多。",
