    "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan | The Taliban have deliberately deprived 1.4 million Afghan girls of schooling through bans, a United Nations agency said Thursday. Afghanistan is the only country in the world that bans female secondary and higher education.\nThe Taliban, who took power in 2021, barred education for girls above sixth grade because they said it didn’t comply with their interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. They didn’t stop it for boys and show no sign of taking the steps needed to reopen classrooms and campuses for girls and women.\nUNESCO said at least 1.4 million girls have been deliberately denied access to secondary education since the takeover, an increase of 300,000 since its previous count in April 2023, with more girls reaching the age limit of 12 every year.\n“If we add the girls who were already out of school before the bans were introduced, there are now almost 2.5 million girls in the country deprived of their right to education, representing 80% of Afghan school-age girls,” UNESCO said.\nThe Taliban did not respond to requests for comment.\nAccess to primary education has also fallen since the Taliban took power in Aug. 2021, with 1.1 million fewer girls and boys attending school, according to UNESCO data.\nThe U.N. agency warned that authorities have “almost wiped out” two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan. ” The future of an entire generation is now in jeopardy,” it added.\nIt said Afghanistan had 5.7 million girls and boys in primary school in 2022, compared with 6.8 million in 2019. The enrollment drop was the result of the Taliban decision to bar female teachers from teaching boys, UNESCO said, but could also be explained by a lack of parental incentive to send their children to school in an increasingly tough economic environment.\n“UNESCO is alarmed by the harmful consequences of this increasingly massive drop-out rate, which could lead to a rise in child labor and early marriage,” it said.\nThe Taliban celebrated three years of rule Wednesday at Bagram Air Base, but there was no mention of the country’s hardships, nor promises to help the struggling population.\nDecades of conflict and instability have left millions of Afghans on the brink of hunger and starvation and unemployment is high.",

    "text": "Saving Species Challenge Attracts Global Interest [Indianapolis Zoo](/news/indianapolis-zoo/) 28 Dec, 2023, 17:00 GMT [] 52 applicants in the running for $1 million INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Indianapolis Zoo's bold new conservation initiative will award $1 million to a single organization working to save a species from extinction. The Saving Species Challenge has attracted the interest of conservationists representing 52 species in 46 nations. Each applicant has developed a detailed plan that, if funded, will have a measurable and sustainable impact on the survival of a threatened animal species. The Indianapolis Zoo launched the Saving Species Challenge in April with the goal of funding a plan with the potential to improve the status of species that is currently designated as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Extinct in the Wild) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. The announcement of the 52 applicants comes on the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act in the United States, which has given legal protection to hundreds of species. \"We focus on our mission of protecting nature and inspiring people to care for our world. The Saving Species Challenge is a solid investment in protecting and preserving the diversity of life on Earth,\" said Dr. Robert Shumaker, President & CEO of the Indianapolis Zoo. Conservationists at the Global Center for Species Survival reviewed nearly 200 pre-applications before inviting 79 organizations to submit full applications. The decision of who will be awarded the $1 million Saving Species Challenge grant rests in the hands of a jury of international animal conservationists. \"We were inspired by the quality of the applications we received. I wish we had $52 million dollars to fund every single one of these conservation action plans,\" said Bill Street, Indianapolis Zoo Senior Vice President and Director of the Global Center for Species Survival. Challenge applications not only represent strong geographic diversity, but also biological diversity. Applicants submitted plans to improve the conservation status of 7 amphibians, 17 birds, 3 fish, 3 insects, 12 mammals and 10 reptiles. The Saving Species Challenge is modeled after a concept developed by experts at the IUCN Species Survival Commission. \"Reverse the Red\" aims to downlist species that are assessed on the IUCN Red List. For example, if a species is currently listed as Extinct in the Wild, downlisting it to Critically Endangered would signify an improvement in the species' chance of survival. The winner of the Indianapolis Zoo Saving Species Challenge will have five years to implement their program and show progress. The Zoo will announce the winner in the spring of 2024.

    "text": "di Jacopo Storni - Foto Majlend Bramo Addio alla «casa più bella e fatata» «l'oasi di vecchio Siam» descritta da Terzani che visse qui con la famiglia. Per anni era stata meta di pellegrinaggio degli amanti dello scrittore\nEra l’incubo di Tiziano Terzani e adesso quell’incubo si è drammaticamente avverato. Turtle House non c’è più. La casa fatata di Bangkok dove per anni ha vissuto la famiglia Terzani, ha lasciato spazio a un palazzo per nuove residenze .\nPrima c’erano gli alberi, uno stagno con una tartaruga (per questo venne soprannominata Turtle House), tanti piccoli vialetti di erba e ghiaia, le ampie vetrate in legno dove ha vissuto il giornalista e scrittore fiorentino insieme alla moglie Angela e ai figli Saskia e Folco. Adesso al suo posto c’è il cemento, un grande palazzo con scritto «Walden Asoke. Embrace your pursuit of happiness», l’azienda che si occupa del progetto condominiale che sorge in quest’area della capitale tailandese.\nLa casa come era quando ci viveva Terzani\nGli operai sono impegnati ogni giorno a tirare su questo nuovo grande palazzo. E quindi addio magia, quella magia così amata da Terzani e celebrata in tanti suoi libri tra cui Un indovino mi disse, vero e proprio tributo all’Asia e alle sue secolari tradizioni che resistono all’imperversare della globalizzazione e della modernità.\nEra stato lui stesso a scrivere le preoccupazioni del futuro di quella casa raccontandone il trasloco di tutta la famiglia nei giorni tailandesi: «Ci installammo a Bangkok nella casa più bella e fatata in cui abbiamo mai vissuto, un’oasi di vecchio Siam in mezzo all’orrore del cemento . Turtle House era splendida la notte. I grattacieli che ci crescevano attorno ci toglievano ogni giorno più sole, ma quando calava la sera la casa tornava ad avere quella calda, quieta magia tropicale».\nUna foto scattata 6 anni fa da un visitatore\nLo storico custode Kamsen, amico e collaboratore di Terzani, era rimasto lì per decenni, a guardia della casa. Adesso anche lui se ne è andato.\nUna storia lunga, quella di Turtle House. Dopo aver ospitato i Terzani divenne un ristorante. Seguirono anni di abbandono. Per scongiurarne la demolizione, negli anni scorsi era stata lanciata una petizione che aveva raccolto migliaia di firme . La Società Dante Alighieri di Bangkok aveva avanzato un’offerta per acquistare la casa e realizzare qui la propria sede, oltre che un piccolo museo dedicato al giornalista e alla cultura italiana. L’affare però era saltato. Negli anni, gli appassionati di Terzani che arrivavano dall’Italia e non solo, sostavano in pellegrinaggio davanti alla casa, a volte riuscendo ad entrare in quella che era la piccola foresta nel cuore della metropoli.\nOggi quella piccola foresta è definitivamente scomparsa. Il cemento ha vinto, con buona pace di Tiziano Terzani.\nL'avviso dei lavori: la foto scattata alcuni anni fa\nCosa rimane oggi (Foto Majlend Bramo)\nFoto Majlend Bramo\nFoto Majlend Bramo\nFoto Majlend Bramo\nFoto Majlend Bramo\nFoto Majlend Bramo\nVai a tutte le notizie di Firenze",

    "text": "ANN ARBOR, MI - University of Michigan’s largest free tuition program is getting a hefty expansion as part of the university’s shifting diversity efforts.\nThe Go Blue Guarantee previously covered tuition for in-state families making less than $75,000 in income a year. The Board of Regents announced the expanded threshold of $125,000 during the Dec. 5 meeting.\nThe expansion means more than 2,000 additional in-state and current undergraduate students can qualify for free tuition on the Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint campuses, university officials said Thursday.\nIn addition to annual income, eligible families with assets up to $125,000 also qualify starting in the fall 2025 semester. Since the Go Blue Guarantee was established in 2018, more than 10,000 students will have received it by next fall, officials said.\n“The Go Blue Guarantee breaks down economic barriers and ensures that a world-class education is available to Michigan students from all backgrounds, no matter their family’s economic means,” President Santa Ono said in a statement.\n“It’s an extraordinary commitment to the state and to the future of this state,” Regent Mark Bernstein said.\nThe regents doubled the annual income threshold for the Go Blue Guarantee to better reflect the state of Michigan’s median income, Regent Mike Behm said. The program initially was marked for $65,000 annually and assets up to $50,000.\nThe regents increased the number to $75,000 in 2021, with Dearborn and Flint students needing to have a 3.5 GPA to qualify.\nRegent Denise Ilitch said the expansion is an example of the board “walking the walk.”\n“We are constantly thinking and talking about an affordable, accessible education for all,” she said.\nThe expansion will cost an additional $8.8 million, officials said.\n“As a state university, we have a responsibility to serve the people of Michigan and — given the many pressures of today’s economy — we want to ensure that working-class and middle-class Michiganders can send their children to this great university and benefit from all that it offers,” said Board Chair Katherine White.\nRegent Sarah Hubbard said the expansion is part of a university-wide effort to shift how it handles diversity, equity and inclusion. Between declaring institutional neutrality, eliminating diversity statements on job applications and the Go Blue Guarantee’s expansion, she said “were open for business for people from all walks of life.”\n“People should feel comfortable on this campus expressing diversity of thought and freedom of expression,” she said.\nThese diversity changes are coming at a time where faculty have organized multiple protests this week regarding concerns of cuts to DEI programs. About 100 protesters walked from Ono’s campus home on South University Avenue to the Ruthven Administrative Building prior to the meeting demanding the regents to maintain DEI funding.\nRead more: Feared DEI cuts prompt faculty pushback at University of Michigan\nProtesters chanted about how the upcoming Trump administration could be affecting the university’s DEI changes. Chris Kolb, vice president for government affairs at the university, confirmed that this is a possibility in comments he made to the board.\n“I have been told pretty bluntly that Congress that this administration will use whatever tools they can to have us yield to what they want us to do,” Kolb said.\nPotential areas to increase funding at the university are through the Department of Energy and Department of Defense, Kolb said. However, the university will have to prepare for federal action on DEI issues.\n“DEI is one of the things that they believe needs to be eliminated from higher education,” he added. “They will use whatever tools they can, including the cutting off of finances, to make that happen, and we need to be aware of that as an institution.”\nIf you would like more reporting like this delivered free to your inbox, click here and signup for our weekly newsletter: Michigan Schools.\nWant more Ann Arbor-area news?

    "title": "Man arrested west of Ballarat after allegedly filming burnouts in church car park",
    "text": "A serial offender has been arrested in Beaufort after allegedly using a stolen car to perform burnouts in a church parking lot. David Mitchell, 24, applied for bail in the Ballarat Magistrates' Court after being charged with multiple counts of motor vehilce theft and committing offences while serving a community corrections order. According to a police informant, in the early hours of February 21, 2024, Mitchell, along with a co-accused, allegedly stole two vehicles in an aggravated burglary from a property in Horsham. The pair then allegedly drove the two cars to a house in Beaufort. While on the way, they stopped at a church in St Arnaud, where the co-accused allegedly filmed Mitchell doing \"circle work\" in a church car park. Later on February 21, police attended the Beaufort property, where the allegedly stolen cars were parked outside. Upon the officers' arrival, Mitchell allegedly tried to run from them before being arrested in Beaufort's main street. While trying to flee from police, Mitchell was allegedly seen throwing an object into a nearby bin. A subsequent search of the bin located keys to one of the stolen cars. The police informant said there was a lot of evidence to connect Mitchell to the alleged car theft, which included CCTV footage from Beaufort Library and videos and images taken on the co-accused's phone. They also said Mitchell had an extensive criminal history, and was serving a community corrections order [CCO] at the time of the offence, which he had received in the Victorian County Court for participating in a home invasion. In addition to the Beaufort incident, Mitchell is also facing charges in relation to an Albury car theft in October 2023. There's certainly work by the prosecution to do, [the evidence is] dynamic and evolving but I definitely wouldn't say it's weak.- Magistrate Mark Stratmann Defence lawyer Gorjan Nikolovski said his client should be granted bail as a lot of the police evidence was circumstantial and solely based on the clothing Mitchell was wearing. Because of this, Mr Nikolovski said his client could face an extended period of time in custody while waiting for the matter to be resolved. He also said Mitchell would have stable housing in Melbourne with an ex-partner and their two children. Magistrate Mark Stratmann rejected Mitchell's application for bail as the danger to the public and the risk of the 24-year-old reoffending couldn't be mitigated. He said while the strength of the evidence against Mitchell had been contested, this didn't mean it was invalid. \"There's certainly work by the prosecution to do, [the evidence is] dynamic and evolving but I definitely wouldn't say it's weak,\" he said.

    "title": "Supuestas lágrimas de sangre de una estatua de la virgen era en realidad sangre de una vidente; encontraron su ADN - Semana",
    "text": "Una mujer que se presentaba como mística y atrajo a cientos de fieles a una aldea cercana a Roma, asegurando que una imagen de la Virgen María derramaba lágrimas de sangre, podría ser llevada a juicio tras revelarse, mediante un análisis de ADN , que la sangre en cuestión le pertenecía.Los análisis iniciales del ADN de la supuesta sangre en las lágrimas, llevados a cabo en los laboratorios de la Universidad de Tor Vergata en Roma, arrojaron un resultado contundente: provenía de un ser humano, específicamente de una mujer. Este hallazgo descartó teorías previas que sugerían que podría tratarse de sangre de cerdo o simplemente pintura roja. Unas horas más tarde, una segunda prueba confirmó que el perfil genético del material analizado coincidía con el de Cardia, según el diario ABC. El Dicasterio para la Doctrina de la Fe del Vaticano declaró formalmente falso dos presuntos fenómenos sobrenaturales: la lágrimas de sangre de una estatua en Trevignano y la multiplicación de pizzas y ñoquis que anunciaba, cuyo nombre de pila es Maria Giuseppe Scapulla. Concretamente, decreta falso el presunto fenómeno sobrenatural atribuido a una estatua de la Virgen María situada en el pequeño pueblo italiano de Trevignano Romano, cerca de la orilla del lago de Bracciano, a unos 40 minutos al norte de Roma, que supuestamente derramaba lágrimas de sangre.El departamento del Vaticano que dirige el cardenal argentino Víctor Manuel Fernández explicó en un comunicado que ha analizado este caso “a la luz” de las nuevas normas para proceder al discernimiento de presuntos fenómenos sobrenaturales publicadas el pasado 17 de mayo, en el que se profundiza de forma exhaustiva en los criterios para reconocer las apariciones y establece más mecanismos de verificación. El Vaticano reconoció así “la validez jurídica” de las decisiones del obispo de Civita Castellana, Marco Salvi, en el decreto del pasado mes de marzo, tanto por el juicio negativo sobre los fenómenos sobrenaturales como por la prohibición de celebraciones o peregrinaciones a los lugares de los supuestos sucesos. Además, declara también falsos los presuntos sucesos sobrenaturales de los que dice haber sido testigo Maria Giuseppe Scapulla, de la multiplicación de pizzas y ñoquis en cenas con gente que la sigue, imitando así el milagro de Jesús con panes y peces recogido en los Evangelios. La mujer italiana también había asegurado tener una estatuilla de la Virgen que compró en Medjugorje y que llora sangre. Sin embargo, fue estudiada posteriormente bajo microscopio por un investigador privado y la conclusión a la que llegó es que las manchas de sangre de esta imagen provían inicialmente en de un cerdo, sin embargo nuevas investigaciones aseguraron que provenían de la misma mujer. Este es un caso sobre el que se había pronunciado varias veces en contra la Pontificia Academia Mariana Internacional, un ente dependiente del Vaticano que imparte talleres gratuitos de Mariología y que instituyó un 2023 para estudiar esta y otras supuestas apariciones.
