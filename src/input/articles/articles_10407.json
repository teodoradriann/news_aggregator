    "text": "MADISON, Wis. — The University of Wisconsin-Madison is celebrating 50 years of its women’s athletics programs.\nIt’s a journey that dates all the way back to 1895, when coach Andrew O’Dea consented to being the women’s boating crew coach. Women’s basketball was soon to follow in 1897.\nWhat You Need To Know The University of Wisconsin-Madison is celebrating 50 years of its women’s athletics programs\nOn March 1, 1974, the Athletic Board approved the inclusion of a 12-sport women’s program\nThe first 12 sports included badminton, basketball, cross-country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, rowing, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field and volleyball\nThere are still 12 women’s athletic programs included at UW-Madison, but some have changed over the years But it wasn’t until March 1, 1974, when the Athletic Board approved the inclusion of a 12-sport women’s program, that women’s athletics became official at UW.\nWith a budget of $118,000, Director of Women’s Athletics, Dr. Kit Saunders and all 12 sports moved into Camp Randall Stadium later that July.\nThe first 12 sports included badminton, basketball, cross-country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, rowing, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field and volleyball.\nDuring this time, many female athletes weren’t offered scholarships, and they often had to buy their own uniforms or share with other sports.\nIn 1976, the first partial scholarships were given to the UW women’s basketball team. That grew to 62 total available scholarships in multiple sports by 1977-78.\nThe NCAA and the Big Ten Conference officially recognized women’s athletics and sanctioned national and conference championships in 1981-82. Women’s athletics have earned several national championship team titles since the start, with hockey earning seven, lightweight rowing with five, rowing with two, cross-country with two and volleyball with one.\nThere are still 12 women’s athletic programs included at UW-Madison, but some have changed over the years.\nField hockey was dropped in 1980 for women’s soccer. After winning the national title in March 1983, badminton was dropped. Then, fencing and gymnastics were dropped in 1991 due to budget constraints at the time.\nCurrently, women’s programs include basketball, cross-country, golf, hockey, lightweight rowing, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field and volleyball.",

    "text": "Lined up to face strong sides like Australia and Uzbekistan in the AFC Asian Cup football in Doha next month, India head coach Igor Stimac on Friday said \"strength of character\" will be the parameter to decide who will be included in the final squad. India are clubbed with formidable Australia, strong central Asian side Uzbekistan and tricky Syria -- all above Stimac's team in the FIFA rankings -- in the group stage of the Asian Cup from January 13 onwards. \"All the boys in the (probable) list are similar in their football qualities. What we are looking for the final list of 26 is definitely experience, physical strength, and the final line will be drawn by the strength of their character,\" Stimac said on the All India Football Federation's social media handles. \"This is very important for us as a team, because no matter the talent, if there is no character nothing can be achieved,\" he added. Stimac will announce his final 26 players before the team's departure on Saturday. Regarding areas which the team needs improvement, he said, \"I am looking for defensive compactness, offensive transition, and the set pieces mostly. \"It's also very important to work on man marking inside the box, because I was not happy with that part of our game, in the last few games. We started leaking some unnecessary goals inside the box because marking was not properly done.\" India will face Australia on January 13, before playing against Uzbekistan (January 18) and Syria (January 23). \"All three opponents are technically good, physically strong, with great speed. So, we are not going to have much difference in approach of all these three games. \"The main focus for us will be to check the fitness level of our players at present and see how much we can develop in the next two weeks,\" he said. Stimac is also grappling with injuries to few of his key players. Defensive midfielder Jeakson Singh, who underwent surgery on his left shoulder early last month, was named among the 50 probables but he is uncertain to be in the final 26. Midfielders Glan Martins and Shah Abdul Samad, both Mohun Bagan players, had suffered injuries recently, which has given more headache to Stimac. Central defender Anwar Ali and winger Ashique Kuruniyan, two key players in Stimac's scheme of things, were not named in the 50-player list due to long term injuries. The 1998 World Cup bronze medallist from Croatia said he wanted the players to believe in themselves and enjoy the game during the Asian Cup in Doha, where they will be playing in the stadiums which had hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \"I am sure our fans will turn out in huge numbers to support the Blue Tigers and help them reach the needed level of confidence,\" he said while speaking to the AFC Asian Cup Local Organising Committee. On talismanic captain Sunil Chhetri, the head coach said, \"Chhetri is unbelievable. It's really important for our younger players to have such an inspirational figure as a captain. \"I hope the team can make the nation proud by playing to the best of its abilities.\" Stimac's former team-mate at West Ham and England World Cupper Trevor Sinclair will assist him as part of the Indian team coaching staff during the Asian Cup.",

    "text": "MPOS adopts anti-conflict measures ‘We recognize the pressing need to confront family feuds, reduce the proliferation of loose firearms, dissolve private armed groups, eradicate the scourge of illegal drugs, and combat all forms of criminal activities.’ ZAMBOANGA CITY — The Ministry of Public Order and Safety recently spearheaded efforts to enhance its mechanisms in preventing the occurrence of violent conflicts in the region. MPOS kicked off the initiative during the 4th Bangsamoro Public Order and Safety Conference with the theme “Consolidating the Gains of Building an Enduring Peace” at Koronadal City from 20 to 21 December 2023. MPOS Minister Hussein Muñoz narrated that the event sought to establish and further strengthen coordination and collaboration mechanisms with different law enforcement agencies, and civil society organizations, among others operating in the region. Muñoz believed that to attain peace, it must be acknowledged that an enduring solution lies not only in dismantling structures of violence but also in addressing the root causes that breed social unrest. “We recognize the pressing need to confront family feuds, reduce the proliferation of loose firearms, dissolve private armed groups, eradicate the scourge of illegal drugs, and combat all forms of criminal activities,” Muñoz said. The military — through Maj. Oliver dela Cruz of the 6th Infantry Division stationed in Maguindanao del Norte — expressed the soldiers’ commitment to support the measure.

    "text": "Los aficionados a la astonomía podrán disfrutar de un espectáculo poco común en febrero cuando ocurra el alineamiento más exacto de siete planetas en el cielo.\nDurante enero ya son visibles en el cielo nocturno seis planetas: Venus, Marte, Júpiter, Saturno, Urano y Neptuno.\nPero el 28 de febrero, durante una sola noche, se les unirá Mercurio, en una rara alineación de siete planetas que no volverá a ocurrir hasta 2040.\n¿Qué es una alineación planetaria?\nEn realidad, no es raro que varios planetas puedan verse juntos en el cielo nocturno.\nTampoco es raro ver a los planetas formados en una \"línea\" a través del cielo.\nEsta es una línea imaginaria de la trayectoria aparente del Sol a lo largo de un año, conocida como \"eclíptica\".\nLa eclíptica se debe al hecho de que la Tierra y todos los demás planetas del Sistema Solar se formaron a partir del mismo disco plano de gas y polvo que alguna vez rodeó a nuestro Sol en su infancia.\nEsto significa que todos los planetas del Sistema Solar ocupan aproximadamente el mismo plano orbital (incluida la Tierra) y, por lo tanto, todos siguen más o menos la línea de la eclíptica en el cielo.\nLas diferentes velocidades a las que orbitan los planetas hacen que, en ocasiones, varios de ellos puedan estar alineados aproximadamente en el mismo lado del Sol.\nDesde la Tierra, si las órbitas se alinean correctamente, podemos ver varios planetas en nuestro cielo nocturno al mismo tiempo.\nEs por eso que las llamadas \"alineaciones planetarias\" o \"desfiles planetarios\" son realmente algo inevitable.\n¿Cómo será la alineación planetaria de enero y febrero?\nMercurio, Venus, Marte, Júpiter y Saturno son lo suficientemente brillantes como para ser visibles a simple vista durante las noches despejadas de enero.\nUrano y Neptuno también están allí, pero para verlos se requieren binoculares o un telescopio.\nEn realidad, los planetas no están exactamente alineados. Más bien aparecen en un arco a través del cielo debido a su plano orbital en el Sistema Solar.\nPero la verdadera sorpresa, si el clima lo permite, ocurrirá el 28 de febrero, cuando Mercurio se una a este desfile planetario en un gran espectáculo que podrá ser observado desde la Tierra.\n\"Hay algo especial al ver los planetas con tus propios ojos\", le dijo a BBC Future Jenifer Millard, divulgadora científica y astrónoma de Fifth Star Labs en el Reino Unido.\n\"Es posible ir a Google y obtener una vista más espectacular de todos estos planetas. Pero cuando miras estos objetos, son fotones que han viajado millones o miles de millones de kilómetros a través del espacio para llegar a tus retinas\".\nEl espectáculo puede ser fascinante, pero ¿tienen algún impacto estas alineaciones aquí en la Tierra?\nAlgunos científicos han sugerido que las alineaciones planetarias podrían causar impactos en nuestro planeta, pero la base científica para la mayoría de estas afirmaciones es débil o inexistente.\nComo explica Jenifer Millard, realmente \"es solo una casualidad que estén en esta posición de sus órbitas\".\nLa utilidad de las alineaciones planetarias\nComo señala el periodista de asuntos espaciales y científicos Jonathan O’Callaghan, las alineaciones planterias sí pueden tener un impacto en la vida en la Tierra, en particular en términos de la exploración del Sistema Solar.\n\"Llegar a los planetas exteriores con una nave espacial es difícil porque estos mundos están muy lejos, a miles de millones de kilómetros, y se necesitarían décadas para llegar\", escribe O’Callaghan en BBC Future.\n\"Sin embargo, usar la atracción gravitatoria de un planeta bien ubicado, como Júpiter, para lanzar una nave espacial hacia el exterior puede reducir drásticamente el tiempo de viaje, algo que ninguna nave espacial ha hecho mejor que las naves Voyager de la NASA\", agrega.\nLas alineaciones de planetas han sido utilizadas para investigar muchos aspectos diferentes del Universo, como el descubrimiento y estudio de exoplanetas, los mundos que orbitan alrededor de estrellas distintas al Sol.\nY también hay algunos usos más novedosos, como investigar la existencia de vida extraterrestre en sistemas solares donde los exoplanetas pasan uno frente al otro desde nuestro punto de vista.\nCómo ver la alineación planetaria\nEste evento, que se extenderá por varios días durante enero y febrero, será visible desde distintos puntos del planeta, siempre que las condiciones meteorológicas y la contaminación lumínica lo permitan.\nComo informa la NASA, durante enero en las primeras horas después del anochecer se puede ver a Venus y Saturno en el suroeste, a Júpiter en lo alto y a Marte en el este.\nUrano y Neptuno también están allí, pero se necesita un telescopio para verlos.\nEl momento ideal para observar la alineación es justo después de la puesta del sol, pero se debe tener en cuenta que la hora exacta de salida y puesta de cada planeta variará dependiendo de tu ubicación en la Tierra.\nLa sorpresa especial del espectáculo tendrá lugar el 28 de febrero cuando Mercurio se una a estos seis planetas.\nPara disfrutar el evento, los expertos recomiendan ubicarte en un lugar con cielos oscuros, en zonas alejadas de la contaminación lumínica, como áreas rurales o montañosas.\nTambién se aconseja revisar las condiciones del clima para asegurarte de que el cielo está despejado el día del evento.\nLos expertos de la Queen’s University, en Canadá, recomiendan descargar una aplicación como Stellarium o Star Chart.\nCuando apuntes tu teléfono al cielo, la app te dirá qué objeto del cielo nocturno estás observando.\nLos telescopios y binoculares pueden ayudarle a ver más detalles, como los anillos de Saturno y las lunas de Júpiter.\n*Esta nota fue corregida debido a que una versión previa señalaba erradamente que este tipo de alineación planetaria no se repetiría sino hasta el año 2492.
