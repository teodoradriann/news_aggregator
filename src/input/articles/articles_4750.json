    "text": "Flowers That Grow in Dark don’t need much direct sunlight to bloom, making them perfect for indoor settings!\nIf you are a little sad because the rooms in your house are dark, and it prevents you from enjoying the sight of some beautiful flowers, well, it’s time to smile! The plants on this list will be more than happy to bloom in low-lit spaces!\nFlowers That Grow in Dark\nThese flowers will surely bloom in places that don’t get direct sun – however, do make sure they get a bit of indirect light exposure!\n1. African Violet\nBotanical Name: Saintpaulia\nAfrican violets offer charming purple, blue, pink, or white blooms in shade. For the best growth, provide moderate to low light with a well draining potting mix.\n2. Peace Lily\nBotanical Name: Spathiphyllum\nPeace lilies with glossy dark green leaves and white spathes love warm and low-light spaces – a bright bathroom would be an ideal spot for them!\n3. Dead-nettles\nBotanical Name: Lamium purpureum\nThis one, with its dark foliage and charming blooms, flourish well in deeply shaded areas. Also, make sure they are not in a complete dark place.\n4. Lungwort\nBotanical Name: Pulmonaria\nLungwort blooms in spring with\nsmall pink flowers that soon turn purple-blue. They are a great pick for dim rooms that get a few hours indirect light every day.\n5. Snowdrop\nBotanical Name: Galanthus\nThe Snowdrop thrives in full shade in forestland areas, making them a great pick for low-lit rooms. For more blossoms, make sure they get a bit of indirect light for a few hours.\n6. Moth Orchid\nBotanical Name: Phalaenopsis\nIn dimly lit rooms, the flowering of these\norchids may be less frequent, but still possible. They bloom in white, pink, and purple, often with contrasting markings.\n7. Spider Plant\nBotanical Name: Chlorophytum comosum\nSpider Plants can produce small flowers in low-light conditions, at the end of long stolons. Their blossoms have a star shape and come in white-yellow hue.\n8. Silver Vase Plant\nBotanical Name: Aechmea fasciata\nThis plant can flower in low light; however, it prefers a few hours of indirect light exposure. It grows booms on a spike having pink bracts and\nsmall blue or purple flowers.\n9. Purple Shamrock\nBotanical Name: Oxalis triangularis\nCapable of flowering in low light, the\nPurple Shamrock is however more popular for its stunning foliage. Its flowers are white or pale pink and have a trumpet like shape.\n10. Lipstick Plant\nBotanical Name: Aeschynanthus\nThe plant will happily flower in low lit rooms, though less abundantly. The blooms emerge from dark, tube-like structures, resembling lipstick, hence the name!\n11. Eternal Flame Plant\nBotanical Name: Calathea crocata\nThough mostly grown for its\npatterned foliage, it is capable of flowering in low light, making it ideal for darker rooms. The blooms have an orange-yellow hue and resemble a small flame.\nSome Odd Ones!\n12. Cast Iron Plant\nBotanical Name: Aspidistra elatior\nPopular for its resilience, the\nCast Iron Plant can survive in any growing condition while producing star like flowers at the base in purple hues!\n13. Parlor Palm\nBotanical Name: Chamaedorea elegans\nThe\nParlor Palm can occasionally flower in low light, but it’s not common – so you have to be really lucky to witness them on the plant. They are small and have a yellow tint.\n14. Snake Plant\nBotanical Name: Dracaena trifasciata\nThe champion plant of low light also grow\nwhite or cream flowers that have a strong fragrance! However, it can be a rare event.",

    "title": "Chill out to some granular goodness in Modular Play on Playdate portable",
    "text": "Creator Orllewin didn’t just produce a magical minimalistic modular in glorious black and white on\nPanic’s Playdate mobile system. There is beautiful music to go along with it – and an upcoming free port to Lua (meaning support for other platforms).\nModular Play is an elegant, pedalboard-style modular for sequencers, drum machines, synths, and effects. And coming soon is a port of Granular, an\nexperimental grain sampler for Playdate I wrote about previously. Having Granular in this virtual patchable environment makes it even more irresistible. And yes, it runs on the Playdate, the mobile platform built by Panic in collaboration with Teenage Engineering – the thing that looks like a compact Game Boy with a crank.\nThe month of December has seen wondrous short videos with tranquil sounds emerge on the Öppenlab Yorkshire account – a reference to the Yorkshire home base of the developer. We get some short jams, plus previews of new mods for Modular Play there.\nGranular debut:\nGranular and reversed chime-y sounds, they just never ever get old:\nAdd some beats and sync:\nOh yeah, why did we need AI again? Thumb pianos and music boxes and microphones and humans…\nIt’s beautiful seeing these ultra-portable units. But if you’re not in the mood (or budget) to buy yet another platform, it’s encouraging to see the December Adventure coding project, which aims to port the same Modular Play environment coming to the Lua framework as a free tool. That effort is dubbed, naturally, ModularLöve.\nIt’s also coming along nicely. Not only is this the musical documentation of coding adventures, but it could nicely soundtrack your own coding/patching adventures. (4x LP please!)\nThis software is in-progress and very much unreleased, but it’s strangely mesmerizing just to read through the coding notes and learn a thing or two – or just watch the tool evolve. Orllewin’s December journal is built in Obsidian, the open coding tool that’s become the go-to platform-independent nerd option of choice. (No more getting sucked into proprietary platforms like Evernote and OneNote!)\nDecember Adventure: ModularLöve\nI didn’t know about LÖVE; it’s a really nice open source Lua 2D gaming framework with macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS support:\nIt seems the Granular tool will come to both environments.\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a Panic Playdate, you should absolutely go grab the app for $15.\nModular Play itch.io page (and purchase link)\nThe features above are\ncoming soon to the release, with the Granular module and clock sync.\nPreviously:\nMore on the system:",

    "text": "History will record that Israel committed a holocaust susan abulhawa The Electronic Intifada 22 February 2024\nAttacks on mosques are acts of erasure.\nAbed Rahim Khatib DPA via ZUMA Press It’s 8 pm in Gaza, Palestine right now, the end of my fourth day in Rafah and the first moment I’ve had to sit in a quiet place to reflect.\nI’ve tried to take notes, photos, mental images, but this moment is too big for a notepad or my struggling memory. Nothing prepared me for what I would witness.\nBefore I made it across the Rafah-Egypt border, I read every bit of news coming out of Gaza or about Gaza. I did not look away from any video or image posted from the ground, no matter how gruesome, shocking or traumatizing.\nI kept in touch with friends who reported on their situations in the north, middle and south of Gaza – each area suffering in different ways. I stayed current on the latest statistics, the latest political, military and economic maneuverings of Israel, the US and the rest of the world.\nI thought I understood the situation on the ground. But I didn’t.\nNothing can truly prepare you for this dystopia. What reaches the rest of the world is a fraction of what I’ve seen so far, which is only a fraction of this horror’s totality.\nGaza is hell. It is an inferno teeming with innocents gasping for air.\nBut even the air here is scorched. Every breath scratches and sticks to the throat and lungs.\nWhat was once vibrant, colorful, full of beauty, potential and hope against all odds, is draped in a gray-colored misery and grime.\nBarely any trees Journalists and politicians call it war. The informed and honest call it genocide.\nWhat I see is a holocaust – the incomprehensible culmination of 75 years of Israeli impunity for persistent war crimes.\nRafah is the southernmost part of Gaza, where Israel crammed 1.3 million people into a space the size of London’s Heathrow Airport.\nWater, food, electricity, fuel and supplies are scarce. Children are without school – their classrooms having been turned into makeshift shelters for tens of thousands of families.\nNearly every inch of previously empty space is now occupied by a flimsy tent sheltering a family.\nThere are barely any trees left, as people have been forced to cut them down for firewood.\nI didn’t register the absence of greenery until I happened upon a red bougainvillea. Its flowers were dusty and alone in a deflowered world, but still alive.\nBougainvillea in Gaza.\nsusan abulhawa The incongruity struck me and I stopped the car to photograph it.\nNow I look for greenery and flowers wherever I go – so far in the south (Rafah, Tel al-Sultan) and the Middle Area (Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah). But there are only small patches of grass here and there and an occasional tree waiting to be burned to bake bread for a family subsisting on UN rations of canned beans, canned meat and canned cheese.\nProud people with rich culinary traditions and habits of fresh foods have been reduced and accustomed to a handful of pastes and mush that have been sitting on shelves for so long that all you can taste is the metallic rancidity of the cans.\nIt’s worse in the north.\nMy friend Anas is one of a handful of people who have internet. It’s sporadic and weak, but we can still message each other.\nHe sent me a photo of himself that looked to me like a shadow of the young man I knew. He has lost over 25 kg.\nHunger People first resorted to eating horse and donkey feed, but that’s gone. Now they’re eating the donkeys and horses.\nSome are eating stray cats and dogs, which are themselves starving and sometimes feeding on human remains that litter streets where Israeli snipers picked off people who dared to venture within the sight of their scopes. The old and weak have already died of hunger and thirst.\nFlour is scarce and more valuable than gold.\nI heard a story about a man in the north who managed to get his hands on a bag of flour recently (normally costing $8) and was offered jewelry, electronics and cash worth $2,500 for it. He refused.\nPeople in Rafah feel privileged to have flour and rice reaching them. They will tell you this and you will feel humbled because they offer to share what little they have.\nAnd you will feel ashamed because you know you can leave Gaza and eat whatever you want. You will feel small here because you are unable to make a real dent to assuage the catastrophic need and loss and because you will understand that they are better than you are, as they have somehow remained generous and hospitable in a world that has been most ungenerous and inhospitable to them for so very long.\nI brought as much as I could, paying for extra luggage and weight for six pieces of luggage and filling six more in Egypt. What I brought for myself fit into the backpack I carried.\nI had the foresight to bring five big bags of coffee, which turned out to be the most popular gift among what I brought for my friends here. Making and serving coffee to the staff where I’m staying is my favorite thing to do, for the sheer joy each sip seems to bring.\nBut that will soon run out too.\nHard to breathe I hired a driver to take me to Nuseirat to deliver seven heavy suitcases of supplies, which he ferried down a few flights of stairs. He told me that carrying those bags made him feel human again because it was the first time in four months that he had been up and down stairs.\nIt reminded him of living in a home instead of the tent where he now resides.\nIt is hard to breathe here, literally and metaphorically. An immovable haze of dust, decay and desperation coat the air.\nThe destruction is so massive and persistent that the fine particles of pulverized life don’t have time to settle. The lack of petrol made people resort to filling their cars with stearate – used cooking oil that burns dirty.\nIt emits a peculiar foul smell and film that stick to the air, the hair, clothes, throat and lungs. It took me a while to figure out the source of that pervasive odor, but it’s easy to discern others.\nThe scarcity of running or clean water degrades the best of us. Everyone does their best with themselves and their children, but at some point, you stop caring.\nAt some point, the indignity of filth is inescapable. At some point, you just wait for death, even as you also wait for a ceasefire.\nBut people don’t know what they will do after a ceasefire.\nThey’ve seen pictures of their neighborhoods. When new images are posted from the northern region, people will gather to try to figure out which neighborhood it is, or whose house that mound of rubble used to be.\nErasure I’ve spoken to many survivors pulled from the rubble of their homes. They recount what happened to them with a deadpan countenance, as if it didn’t happen to them; as if it was someone else’s family buried alive; as if their own torn bodies belong to others.\nPsychologists say it’s a defense mechanism, a kind of numbing of the mind for the sake of survival. The reckoning will come later – if they survive.\nBut how does one reckon with losing your entire family, watching and smelling their bodies disintegrate around you in the rubble, as you wait for rescue or death? How does one reckon with total erasure of your existence in the world – your home, family, friends, health, whole neighborhood and country?\nNo photos of your family, wedding, children, parents left; even the graves of your loved ones and ancestors bulldozed. All this while the most powerful forces and voices vilify and blame you for your wretched fate.\nGenocide isn’t just mass murder. It is intentional erasure.\nOf histories. Of memories, books and culture.\nErasure of potential in a land. Erasure of hope in and for a place.\nErasure is the impetus for destroying homes, schools, places of worship, hospitals, libraries, cultural centers, recreational centers and universities.\nGenocide is intentional dismantling of another’s humanity. It is the reduction of a proud, educated, high-functioning and ancient society to penniless objects of charity, forced to eat the unspeakable to survive; to live in filth and disease with nothing to hope for except an end to bombs and bullets raining on and through their bodies, their lives, their histories and futures.\nNo one can think or hope for what might come after a ceasefire. The ceiling of their hope at this hour is for the bombing to stop.\nIt is a minimal ask. A minimal recognition of Palestinian humanity.\nDespite Israel cutting power and internet, Palestinians have managed to livestream a picture of their own genocide to a world that allows it to continue.\nBut history will not lie. It will record that Israel perpetrated a holocaust in the 21st century.\nsusan abulhawa is a writer and activist. She is a founder and director of the Palestine Writes Literature Festival.",

    "text": "NSEMA records 300 fatalities from disasters\nThe House of Representatives, yesterday, raised the alarm over the possible outbreak of communicable diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever and Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) among thousands of victims of the Mokwa flood, which resulted in the death of about 500 people and over 600 missing persons.\nMeanwhile, the state government said that in less than one year, it was overwhelmed with disasters, ranging from the Diko tanker explosion that claimed 80 lives in Suleja, another in Agaie that killed 60 and the recent Mokwa flood that claimed 207 lives, among others.\nThe House resolution was passed sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance on the devastating flooding, leading to loss of lives and property in Mokwa in Niger State and Edu Local Government in Kwara State, sponsored by Joshua Gana and Saba Umaru.\nIn his lead debate, Gana observed that in late May 2025, Niger and Kwara experienced one of their devastating floods in decades, particularly affecting Mokwa town and farmlands in Kwara.\nHe said: “The House further notes that the disaster resulted in over 500 confirmed deaths, with more than 600 people still missing and presumed dead. At least 200 others were injured, and over 4,000 houses were destroyed.\n“It also notes and commend the magnanimity of President Bola Tinubu, who donated N2 billion through the Vice President; the Governor of Niger, who also donated N1 billion, NGOs and well-meaning Nigerians for their contributions and support to ameliorate the plight of the flood victims in Niger.”\nAccording to him, the House is disturbed that there is a heightened risk of disease outbreak in the affected areas. The House urged the federal government, through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), to provide relief materials, including water purification equipment, to prevent disease outbreaks in the affected communities.\nThe Director-General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Abdullahi Arah, in a statement issued to newsmen in Minna, noted that the agency was able to respond quickly to various emergency incidents.\nArah also highlighted various interventions by the Governor Mohammed Bago-led administration within the period and applauded the governor, traditional institutions, community leaders, volunteers and humanitarian partners for their unwavering support in building a safer and more resilient state.\nThe DG also hinted that NSEMA had mobilised resources, deployed response teams, and collaborated with local council authorities and humanitarian partners to provide relief materials and temporary shelter for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from flooding and banditry attacks.\nWhile assuring the agency’s resoluteness in its mission to respond swiftly to emergencies and disasters effectively, he revealed that the agency had stockpiled relief materials at strategic locations across the state for ease of access. The NSEMA boss urged all residents of the state to remain vigilant, comply with safety advisories, and report emergencies promptly.\nMeanwhile, the bodies of a boy and a nine-year-old girl were discovered in a drainage after a heavy downpour in Minna on Tuesday. Initially, residents of the Tunga community in the state capital had thought the flood carried only the girl whose parents were said to hail from Edo State, until the girl’s father was contacted to identify his daughter and discovered that a young male child was also killed in the floods.",

    "text": "Morocco-born killer Ahmed Alid came to the UK to seek asylum having drifted around Europe for years.The former pastry chef and shop owner, convicted of randomly murdering a pensioner walking in Hartlepool town centre, told jurors during his trial he had been jailed in Germany for entering the country without a passport or visa.The 45-year-old was born in Fez, Morocco, but was raised in Algeria, where his grandfather had a business.He left North Africa in 2007, telling Teesside Crown Court via an Arabic interpreter how his shop had been monitored by the intelligence services who were “harassing” him.He arrived in Spain and moved around the continent for years, spending time in Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Austria, never gaining asylum.Alid spent just days or weeks in some countries and years in Germany, where he never achieved his aim of opening a shop.He tried to marry a German woman but had lost his passport in Greece, he told the court, so the marriage could not go through.Late in 2020, he took a ferry from Amsterdam to Middlesbrough where he was arrested by police as he did not have the correct papers and he applied for asylum.Asked by John Elvidge KC, his defence counsel, if that was successful, Alid said: “I didn’t have any answer.”His asylum status was still being processed at the time of the murder of Terence Carney in the street in Hartlepool on 15 October last year, it was understood.He was permitted to work four hours a week, but that did not lead to him getting a job, and he was often seen jogging around Hartlepool to keep fit.Alid was a devout Muslim and prayed five times a day at home, but did not attend a local mosque.He clashed with other asylum seekers living at the Home Office-approved accommodation in Wharton Terrace, in Hartlepool, including arguments about his cleanliness and them leaving alcohol in the communal fridge, which he said was against his religious beliefs.In the days leading up to the attack, they grew concerned about his reaction to the Hamas attacks on Israel.Javed Nouri, the man he tried to murder as he slept in his bed, told police later: “He was sitting on the kitchen chair and checking the news on his mobile phone.“He was laughing and every time they would kill somebody, he would praise God.”He added: “I was very upset from that night and I have seen something terrible and frightening in his eyes.”On Thursday 25 April, a jury unanimously found Alid guilty of murdering Mr Carney, 70, and attempting to murder Mr Nouri and assaulting the two detectives.Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

Le organizzazioni sindacali hanno organizzato la protesta in tutta Italia per riaprire la trattativa con Federmeccanica e Assistal per il rinnovo del contratto collettivo nazionale di lavoro. A sostegno della vertenza dei metalmeccanici e degli scioperi restano confermati il blocco degli straordinari e delle flessibilità in tutti i luoghi di lavoro.\n«Nonostante le mobilitazioni e gli scioperi dei mesi scorsi le posizioni restano distanti con Federmeccanica e Assistal che di fatto non riaprono la trattativa - affermano i sindacati - giudichiamo l'atteggiamento delle controparti, oltre che provocatorio, poco rispettoso nei confronti di tutte le lavoratrici e i lavoratori del comparto che votando la piattaforma sindacale hanno dato dimostrazione di trovare in essa le risposte adeguate per migliorare le proprie condizioni di vita e lavoro».\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori\nVideo © Riproduzione riservata La guida allo shopping del Gruppo Gedi i Consigli.it sceglie e raccomanda in maniera indipendente prodotti e servizi che si possono acquistare online o tramite la consulenza di esperti.
