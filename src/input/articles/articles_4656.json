She also told him he must surrender his national ID card and not apply for replacement travel documents.\nHe has the legal right to anonymity.\nDefence solicitor Morgan Redmond said his client understood the bail terms.\nThe man, accompanied to court by his partner, listened to the proceedings with the aid of an interpreter and was ordered to appear again in September for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.\nLegal aid was granted to the accused, who works full-time, earns about 400 a week, and pays rent.",
