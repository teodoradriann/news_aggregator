    "title": "Houston aerospace industry: City expected to boom as numerous projects, including Odysseus lunar lander, hit key milestones - ABC13 Houston",
    "text": "HOUSTON, Texas -- Feb. 15 was a day to remember for Houston's aerospace industry. The video above is from a previous report . Two projects with Houston origins passed key landmarks. It started with Intuitive Machines, headquartered at Houston Spaceport, launching a payload to the moon from Florida. READ MORE: Odysseus, private lunar lander, successfully touches down on moon's surface \"It's like when your team makes the playoffs,\" Jim Szczesniak, aviation director for the Houston Airport System, which oversees the spaceport, said. It ended with Texas A&M signing a lease with NASA to build a $200 million space institute at Johnson Space Center. The projects are some examples of efforts to achieve new feats in outer space. With new businesses moving in, missions incoming, and developments locking in by the month, Houston aerospace industry officials expect the city to be home to some of the world's most cutting-edge projects and a space exploration hub. At NASA, along with a slate of new missions taking place, the Johnson Space Center is planning a new development called Exploration Park, which will be home to research and testing for future space travel. There has yet to be a set timeline on when it could be built out, but in February, NASA locked in two partnership agreements for the site. Meanwhile, officials expect the Houston Spaceport to be home to many new projects in the coming years, Szczesniak said. Spaceport officials not only expect to add more businesses in the coming years - in a pursuit to make the spot a destination - but companies located there have plans to launch more of their creations into space. It's like when your team makes the playoffsJim Szczesniak - Houston Airport System Meanwhile, companies like Aegis Aerospace, a woman-owned business founded in 2021, are adding to the commercial space sector. \"(JSC) and the commercial work that goes into these space endeavors is a major driving force for the economy in the area,\" Brian Freedman, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, said. At the heart of the industry in the area is NASA's Houston-based Johnson Space Center, which, in addition to employing more than 10,000 people, has several plans and projects that have either begun or are set to begin in the near future. The center will host a few simulated missions to Mars, such as the Human Exploration Research Analog, or HERA, Campaign 7, which began in January. Another project, expected to last a year, will see a four-person volunteer crew work inside a 1,700-square-foot, 3D-printed habit, according to a February news release from the agency. That project could begin in the spring of 2025, and NASA is looking for potential volunteers. Meanwhile, plans for actual space travel could find a home in the agency's Artemis missions, which, while delayed until 2025, could take astronauts around the moon, to the moon's south pole, and eventually to a new space station, named Gateway, that NASA is working to launch in 2025 with the help of other space agencies. READ MORE: NASA delays its Artemis moon missions Those priorities are reflected in its budget over the past decade, which has seen more resources dedicated to exploration, according to budget documents. While NASA's budget overall has increased by about 40% from fiscal years 2014-15 to 2022-23, the exploration portion of its budget is up by more than 70% in that same time. NASA documents show many of these upcoming exploration projects will be controlled from JSC. \"For more than 60 years, JSC has cemented its position as a hub for human space exploration,\" JSC Director Vanessa Wyche said at a Feb. 15 conference. \"The future of Texas's legacy in aerospace is bright.\" The JSC is set to host a new $200 million space institute being built by Texas A&M, which will host the country's first - and the world's largest - simulated lunar and Mars surfaces, Texas A&M Chancellor John Sharp said at a Feb. 15 conference. Once built, it will be the first development on the 240-acre Exploration Park, Wyche said. That new area will host several entities that will research and test to prepare for future space travel. To help build out that area, NASA officials signed a second agreement for the site on Feb. 29 with the American Center for Manufacturing & Innovation, or ACMI. ACMI is calling the development the Space Systems Campus, according to a Feb. 29 release from NASA. It will be an \"applied research facility\" that partners with different government, academia, and commercial entities. They will look to help meet the area's defense and aerospace needs and facilitate the manufacturing of space hardware. Working with NASA is the Houston Spaceport, which currently hosts three companies: Axiom Space, Intuitive Machines, and Collins Aerospace. All three are slated to play pivotal roles in the space industry in the coming years, industry officials said. While Intuitive Machines just launched a payload to the moon, which landed Feb. 22, with materials to study the lunar surface, Axiom is looking to build the world's first commercial space station. The plan is to assemble it at its Houston location over the next few years. To assist in those efforts, the latest development for the spaceport is Taxiway Lima, Szczesniak said. The taxiway will connect the companies to Ellington Field Airport, allowing for international deliveries to be taken directly to the companies at the spaceport. It will come out of Houston Airport System's enterprise fund, costing $16 million. The taxiway is also one piece of the larger puzzle to develop the spaceport into a destination, which could mean developments spanning beyond just aerospace, Szczesniak said. \"Houston's got a tremendous (reputation) historically, but also tremendous potential going forward,\" Szczesniak said. In a nutshell, Houston is Space CityJim Szczesniak - Houston Airport System Aegis Aerospace founder and owner Stephanie Murphy said she foresees the area continuing to grow in the realm of aerospace. Thanks to the various institutions built into the area, there are resources to support both endeavors and companies looking to open up shop here, she said. \"I think we're going to continue growing,\" Murphy said. \"The private and public partnerships ... have been such a successful model. ... It opens up the entrepreneurial spirit here for these companies that are small and nimble.\" Aegis Aerospace is headquartered near Nassau Bay and offers a variety of testing facilities in outer space for both government agencies and private companies looking to collect data. Currently, they have one facility at the International Space Station and are looking to expand their services to the lunar surface, Murphy said. They are also one of the partners chosen to help build out a new institute for the U.S. Space Force's in-space operations, Community Impact previously reported. Szczesniak also expects the growth of the area to continue and is looking at the spaceport to be a potential hub for it. \"In a nutshell, Houston is Space City, and there was an understanding for Houston that we need to take advantage of that,\" Szczesniak said. \"By 2040ish, (industry leaders) think space might be a trillion-dollar industry.\" Murphy described the current state of the industry as almost a \"golden era\" of space. One possible hangup, however, is growth outpacing the available workers, she said. As a result, efforts to increase training are a priority. San Jacinto College's EDGE Center, for example, is offering aerospace courses to help train future workers in the area. \"I think there's an opportunity from universities and local community colleges that have gotten grant money to increase that training,\" Murphy said. According to officials, various businesses, NASA, and the Houston Spaceport, some of the projects that are either planned or ongoing include: This article comes from our ABC13 partners at Community Impact Newspapers .",

    "text": "– Coast Guard crew members from Station Morro Bay rescued four boaters Saturday after their vessel caught fire while under tow approximately five miles off the coast of Cayucos, according to a report on the United States Coast Guard News website . At 9:30 a.m., Coast Guard watchstanders received a report of a disabled 24-foot motorboat located about 200 yards off Whale Rock in Cambria. A 47-foot response boat crew was launched to assist and began towing the vessel. Around noon, the vessel’s engine caught fire during the tow. The Coast Guard crew released the tow line and instructed the four boaters to enter the water wearing life jackets. The crew then pulled all four individuals from the water and provided first aid. After the fire was extinguished by Morro Bay Harbor Patrol, the motorboat sank. The rescued boaters were transported to Coast Guard Station Morro Bay, where they were evaluated by Morro Bay Harbor Patrol and Morro Bay Fire Department personnel. One individual was taken to a San Luis Obispo hospital with minor burns. The cause of the incident is under investigation.",

    "title": "Sawmill closure ‘dire’ for Fraser Lake and its Indigenous communities: chiefs - The Abbotsford News",
    "text": "Local First Nation communities have expressed shock and concern following the announcement of Fraser Lake Sawmill’s permanent closure. West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. announced the decision on Monday (Jan. 22) citing the lack of economically viable fibre in the region. The mill closure will affect 175 employees. In a Jan. 23 statement, Chiefs and councils of Stellat’en and Nadleh Whut’en expressed deep sympathy for those affected by the closure, emphasizing the profound impact on not just sawmill workers but also on related industries such as logging, transportation, and hospitality. The sawmill has long been considered the economic heartbeat of Fraser Lake and the adjacent villages of Stellaquo and Nadleh. Chief Robert Michelle of Stellat’en First Nation conveyed the human toll, stating, “We’ve got members who work at that sawmill, and so does Nadleh. Add to that the job losses from people working in the bush, hauling logs, all the way down to people working in restaurants and pumping gas, and you can see the economic impact for our communities will be dire.” The closure is attributed to challenges faced by mills in the region, including difficulties accessing economical fiber due to salvage harvests following the mountain pine beetle infestation and reduced international demand for dimensional lumber. Despite collaborative efforts between the Indigenous nations and the province to secure a sustainable fiber supply, West Fraser’s decision to shut down the mill came unexpectedly. Chief Martin Louie of Nadleh Whut’en expressed frustration with West Fraser’s actions. “If West Fraser is not interested in supporting the regional economy, then we need to ensure that the forest resources they continue to control - the licenses themselves - are transferred to local interests.” Both Stellat’en and Nadleh are now calling on the province of British Columbia to provide additional resources to help the affected communities. This includes training programs for alternative employment sectors, temporary increases in funding to the municipality of Fraser Lake to maintain essential services, and investments in local economic development. “We stand shoulder to shoulder with our non-Indigenous neighbors as we all endure these lean times together,” Chief Michell emphasized. “We know our territories can and will provide wealth for our nations and our neighbors in the future. Right now, we all need support from our fellow British Columbians to diversify our economies across the north.” READ ALSO: [West Fraser Timber shutters Fraser Lake sawmill, 175 B.C. jobs lost](https://www.interior-news.com/news/west-fraser-timber-shutters-fraser-lake-sawmill-175-bc-jobs-lost-7300167)",

    "text": "No, There's No \"Age Of AI\" or \"Era Of AI\" or \"AI Revolution\" or \"AI Arms Race\", It's Just a Dying Tech Industry Looking to Prop Up Its Valuation Using Hype and False Marketing of Mostly Dysfunctional Tools\nPlease, enough with this nonsense based on theoretical \"use cases\" and sometimes intentional vapourware\nEarlier this week CSS-Tricks published something entitled \"The Importance Of Investing In Soft Skills In The Age Of AI\" (yes, hey hi!) and the latter part seems absurd. Cheaper coders (working for less money), not LLMs, is the real \"issue\". As for hey hi (AI), it can be seen as the catch-all excuse/scapegoat. It's always there in the a corporate propagandists' toolset. Here's a new example of this, in fact one wherein a Microsoft-friendly publisher uses \"hey hi\" (AI) to make a business failure of Microsoft - and now thousands of more layoffs - seem like \"innovation\" to be admired.\nThe title speaks of \"The Age Of AI\", but there is no \"AGE OF HEY HI\"... as ML (machine learning) is over 50 years old in some sense.\n\"Again,\" an associate argues, \"it's still about control. Whoever writes the code controls the computers and they can be controlled by turning them into wage slaves.\"\nWell, in theory we could write and execute our own code, but Microsoft and IBM try to mandate that only SOME code can be run (UEFI 'secure' boot was put inside Linux by Red Hat so as to put Microsoft in control). Therein is the real threat - computers that do not allow the user to run actually secure code, only backdoored garbage (in binary form) from GAFAM et al.\nJudging by new puff pieces like this one, Microsoft is now super-worried that shareholders might realise Azure has failed (the \"hey hi\" smokescreen aside) and possibly still loses money (if not market share, too). Azure is were a lot of those layoffs are happening and have been happening for 5 years already. Microsoft cooks the books to hide what's really happening. The buzzwords help, so bypass those.
