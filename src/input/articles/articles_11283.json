    "title": "Messina, l’area pedonale sul viale San Martino diventa permanente | DETTAGLI",
    "text": "L’istituzione in via permanente dell’area pedonale lungo il viale San Martino a Messina , nel tratto compreso tra le vie Ettore Lombardo Pellegrino e S. Cecilia, con esclusione della sede tranviaria e delle intersezioni con le vie Maddalena e S. Cecilia, è stata assunta con Delibera di Giunta comunale n. 451, esitata oggi pomeriggio nel corso dei lavori dell’Esecutivo di palazzo Zanca, su proposta del vicesindaco e assessore alla Mobilità urbana Salvatore Mondello . La scelta dell’Amministrazione rappresenta un passo importante verso la realizzazione degli obiettivi previsti dal Piano Urbano della Mobilità Sostenibile (PUMS), in linea con le previsioni del Piano Generale del Traffico Urbano.\n“La mobilità si integri con la qualità della vita” “Il nostro impegno – afferma il sindaco Federico Basile – è quello di offrire una Città dove la mobilità si integri con la qualità della vita, promuovendo l’equilibrio tra sostenibilità ambientale e dinamismo urbano. Con la pedonalizzazione permanente di quest’area, stiamo dimostrando come sia possibile ridisegnare il volto di Messina, rendendola più a misura di famiglie, turisti e cittadini. L’odierna decisione non rappresenta solo un intervento sul traffico, ma è parte di una visione più ampia che guarda alla città come uno spazio da condividere, tutelare e valorizzare”.\n“Una delle innovazioni più significative per la nostra città” “La scelta di rendere permanente e definitiva la pedonalizzazione – evidenzia il vicesindaco Salvatore Mondello – rappresenta una delle innovazioni più significative per la nostra città. Una scelta pienamente coerente con l’impegno dell’Amministrazione nel promuovere una mobilità più sostenibile e inclusiva, allineandosi alle direttive delineate dal Piano Urbano della Mobilità Sostenibile (PUMS). Questo passo rappresenta una visione strategica che non solo risponde alle esigenze ambientali della città, ma promuove anche una trasformazione culturale nell’uso dello spazio pubblico, per offrire ai cittadini – conclude il Vicesindaco – uno spazio urbano più sicuro, meno congestionato, in cui è possibile muoversi e vivere in un ambiente più salubre e a misura d’uomo. Una scelta che guarda al futuro”.",

    "text": "The United Kingdom is hitting the brakes on trade talks with Canada after Ottawa decided to not extend two temporary measures put in place after Brexit.\nLondon announced the pause in negotiations today, less than a month before the next round of talks towards a permanent trade deal was expected to take place.\nA special quota for U.K. cheese imports, which offered the same low-tariff access to the Canadian market as the European Union has, expired at the end of last month.\nCanada has also decided not to extend country-of-origin rules set to expire at the end of March, which will likely drive up the price of U.K. goods such as luxury cars.\nTrade Minister Mary Ng's office says the move stems from British \"unwillingness\" to offer something in return, such as budging on a dispute over Canadian meat.\nBoth countries insist they want a fair deal for each other's businesses, farmers and workers.\n\"We reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made,\" reads a statement from the British government.\n\"We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future to build a stronger trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nShanti Cosentino, a spokeswoman for Ng, said Canada is \"disappointed\" in the move.\n\"Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations,\" she said.\n\"The U.K. is a long-standing trading partner, and I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is (a) win-win for Canada and for the U.K.\"\nCanada's cattle sector has been lobbying against a deal with the U.K. over a long-standing dispute on hormone-treated beef and pork.\nThe U.K. has held back on importing meats treated with certain hormones that are widely used by Canadian ranchers, who argue the Brits' concern isn’t grounded in science.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024.",

    "title": "Dunkin' faces potential class-action lawsuit for alleged discriminatory upcharge on nondairy milks",
    "text": "Lactose intolerant coffee drinkers who opt for nondairy alternatives like soy, almond or oat milk in their drinks at Dunkin' may pay as much as $2 more for the alternatives, which a new potential class-action lawsuit claims could constitute discrimination.\nThe suit, filed last month in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeks class certification and represents 10 Dunkin' customers who say they purchased beverages \"that contained non-dairy milk alternatives\" between 2018 and 2023, and \"paid a surcharge\" for either \"plant-based or lactose-free milk\" in California, New York, Texas, Colorado, Massachusetts and Hawaii.\nAccording to legal documents obtained by ABC News, the plaintiffs named in the suit all suffer from lactose intolerance and milk allergies, making it medically necessary \"to avoid consuming drinks that contain milk.\"\nDepending on the date and location, the customers were charged anywhere from 50 cents to $2.15 extra for the substitution, the filing states.\nThe lawsuit seeks damages amounting to no less than $5,000,000, and plaintiffs demanded a jury trial.\nOn Friday, Dunkin' filed a waiver that acknowledged the lawsuit. The company has until March 4 to respond.\nThe lawsuit specifically points to the \"allergen statement\" displayed in Dunkin' stores that advises customers to inform a barista if they have a food allergy before placing an order.\n\"Dunkin will modify its regular beverage offerings to remove sugar or use sugar-free sweeteners at no additional charge for those persons with diabetes or who need to control weight,\" the lawsuit states. \"However, they only accommodate those with lactose intolerance or allergies to milk by imposing a surcharge. There is no expertise or additional work required of Dunkin employees that would substitute whole milk or fat-free milk in place of 2% regular milk, or who would make caffeine-free or sugar-free beverages, to also be able to substitute Non-Dairy Alternatives such as soy, almond, coconut, oat, or other lactose-free 'milk' in place of 2% regular milk.\"\nThe lawsuit claims that because lactose intolerance and milk allergies are both considered disabilities, Dunkin's \"conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act,\" as well as state anti-discrimination laws where the respective customers purchased their beverages.\nThe ADA states that public entities are required to make \"reasonable modifications\" to policies or practices when it's necessary for an individual with a disability to afford their goods, services, facilities, privileges or advantages.\nAs cited in the lawsuit, the ADA also states that \"a public accommodation may not impose a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids, barrier removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, that are required to provide that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment required by the Act or this part.\"\nIn this case, plaintiffs claimed Dunkin' violated the ADA due to the failure \"to make modifications that are necessary to afford goods and services to persons with lactose intolerance but instead imposes a surcharge on this group, purportedly to cover the cost of such measures.\"\nDunkin' did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the lawsuit. The Massachusetts-based coffee chain has not yet issued a public statement on the matter.",

    "title": "Corey Taylor Says Eloy Casagrande Was the Only Drummer “Brave Enough” to Meet with Slipknot",
    "text": "There’s been plenty of time to reflect on Slipknot ‘s hiring of ex- Sepultura drummer Eloy Casagrande as their Jay Weinberg replacement and it seems like the overwhelming consensus is that he’s the perfect fit. The dude just smashes behind the kit, as evidenced by all of the insane performance videos that have been making the rounds online.\nWhile speaking with Revolver , vocalist Corey Taylor went into a little more detail about the selection process and how while most candidates opted to send videos to the band instead of meet in person, Casagrande was really the only one to step up to the plate.\n“I think we just kinda went, ‘You know what? Let’s just tell people.’ It was really as simple as that, you know? Eloy was the only one who was brave enough to get in the room with us. There were a handful of other people that we were looking at, and none of them wanted to jam with us. They just wanted to do their own thing and send it in — a very TikTok thing, you know? And we were like, ‘That’s not the way this works, dude.’\n“Eloy rearranged his schedule to come see us. He was so hungry to jam and just see what would happen that we were immediately impressed just by that alone. He didn’t get it right away — getting to know him was just as important as jamming with him — but by the time we made that decision, we were, like, ‘Let’s tell the world now. He’s earned it.’ Our audience is so used to us kind of keeping our cards close to our chest, but to me it was more refreshing to just kind of come out and go, ‘Yeah, he’s our dude.'”\nCould you fucking imagine getting a call from a major band like Slipknot and thinking “nah, I’ll just send in a video.” What?! You get selected by Slipknot as a potential candidate and you let an opportunity of a lifetime slip away like that?! Yikes.\nWell, I’d say it all turned out for the best. Weinberg’s jamming out with Suicidal Tendencies , ex- Suicidal Tendencies drummer Greyson Nekrutman is now playing with Sepultura, and Casagrande’s with Slipknot. Seems like a win-win-win situation for everyone.\nIf you’d like to catch Casagrande fucking tear it up on the drums with Slipknot live, then good news; there are plenty of live shows coming up throughout the rest of the year. The band’s celebrating the 25th anniversary of their debut album, so you have a real good chance to see them live at some point.
