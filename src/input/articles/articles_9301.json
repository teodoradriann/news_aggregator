    "text": "The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) has confirmed in its latest Global Climate Highlights report that 2024 was the hottest on record. The study reveals a rise of 1.6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times — defined as the level between 1850 and 1900. Previously, 2023 was the warmest year.\nAt the in 2015, 196 world leaders agreed to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and to pursue efforts to keep temperatures below 1.5 degrees (2.7 Fahrenheit).\nSamantha Burgess, C3S deputy director told DW that the world is now “teetering on the edge of passing the 1.5-degree level.”\nShe added that though the average of the , it did not imply the Paris Agreement was broken, as the agreement is based on a mean calculated over decades and not individual years. But “it shows the trajectory we are on,” she said, warning of the impacts.\n“We know from our understanding of the climate system that the warmer the atmosphere is, the more likely we are to have these hazardous extreme weather events and that’s what really impacts people and ecosystems,” she said.\nThe weather impacts of rising temperatures So far, global average temperatures — as measured over decades — have reached 1.3 degrees, an increase that has already seen devastating consequences.\nIn 2024 wildfires scorched parts of the and affected several countries in the region, while parts of Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and by heavy flooding. Heatwaves struck in Europe and West Africa and tropical storms swept across parts of the United States and Philippines.\nScientists working as part of World Weather Attribution, an organization that studies the links between extreme weather and climate change, found that 26 of the events they looked at last year had been made worse or more likely to happen due to rising temperatures.\nHuman burning of fossil fuels for activities such as heating, industry, and transportation is the main driver of global warming, but natural phenomena, like El Niño have also played a part in pushing up temperatures over the past two years, said scientists at C3S.\nWarming oceans raising temperatures in 2025 Typically occurring every two to seven years,, leading to overall average sea surface temperatures that are 0.51 degrees Celsius higher than the 1991 – 2020 average.\nSea surface temperatures are of particular concern to scientists because oceans store around 90% of the heat connected to global warming.\n“It has acted as a buffer over the past half century, or 70 years, for us. We are exceeding that buffer capacity, and we are feeling that in terms of extreme events on land,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of scientific excellence at the Union of Concerned Scientists nonprofit, who was not involved in collating the C3S data.\nAlthough the El Niño phase ended in 2024, Burgess said the ocean is holding onto more heat than in previous cycles which could impact heat levels in the coming year. “Until we see that effectively dissipate into the deep ocean, we’re likely to continue to see very high temperatures, but maybe not record-breaking temperatures,” she said.\nLimiting global temperatures Despite growing alarm over rising global temperatures,. C3S reported that the rate of increase of carbon dioxide was higher than that observed in recent years. The gas, which remains in the atmosphere for 300 to 1000 years, is most associated with rising temperatures.\nSenior climate campaigner at environmental NGO Greenpeace USA John Noel blamed the “grim milestone” of the hottest recorded year on “deliberate obstruction” by fossil fuel executives and political allies.\n“We must dismantle the dangerous corporate delusion that fossil fuel expansion can continue without consequence. Instead, we must embrace the once in a lifetime opportunity to build the zero-carbon infrastructure needed for a safe future that includes everyone,” he said in a press statement.\nMeanwhile, Burgess told DW that without immediate action it was unlikely long-term average temperatures could be kept under the 1.5-degree limit. But she added that the world should not abandon those targets as .\n“[Climate change] is not a future problem that we have to deal with or that future generations will have to deal with, it’s a problem that we need to talk about now and that we need to make sure that whoever we vote for is taking action on issues that are important to us to make sure we can mitigate future climate change and adapt to our existing climate,” she added.\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker",

    "text": "Dave Ramsey offers well-timed advice on buying a house now\nMany people considering buying a home were encouraged in December 2023 when average mortgage rates dropped below 7%.\nPersonal finance personality Dave Ramsey has weighed in with some advice on how (and how not) to approach the opportunity for those who are planning to buy a home.\nRelated: Dave Ramsey has blunt words on what to do with your money now\nBeyond December's mortgage rate developments, expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates in 2024 are on the rise, further fueling the sense that the time may be right to purchase real estate.\nLower rates should also encourage homebuilders to borrow money, which should lead to a greater supply of homes.\nIn 2024, mortgage interest rates could average 6.3%, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nRamsey emphasized that there are plenty of choices available and multiple ways to go about buying a house, but he has a few essential guidelines that he suggests people follow.\nRamsey's recommended math on buying a home\nRamsey begins with his belief that the best way to pay for a home is with cash. This, of course, is not an option available for most people, but establishing that as the most desired method (even in theory) helps inform other decisions to be made.\n\"If that's not feasible for you, the next best thing is a smart home mortgage loan,\" he wrote on\nRamsey Solutions. \"It may be easy to dive headfirst into the mortgage option that will allow you to buy a home with next to nothing down.\"\n\"But a bad mortgage product can be a liability in your financial portfolio,\" he added. \"A home should be a blessing to your family, not a financial nightmare.\"\nThe bestselling author and radio host suggests three preconditions a potential buyer should meet before taking on a mortgage.\nFirst, Ramsey said, be sure you are completely debt free.\nSecond, have three to six months of expenses saved in an emergency fund.\nThird, it's important that you have saved for a big down payment.\n\"We recommend at least 10%, but 20% is even better since it will allow you to avoid PMI payments,\" Ramsey wrote.\nPrivate mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of mortgage insurance you might be required to buy if you take out a conventional loan with a down payment of less than 20 percent of the purchase price, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. PMI protects the lender — not you — if you stop making payments on your loan.\nThe best type of mortgage\nRamsey then explains what he advises is the best mortgage option.\n\"Your home loan should be a conventional, fixed-rate mortgage with a 15-year (or less) term,\" he wrote.\n\"Do not get a 30-year mortgage!\" he emphasized. \"A $175,000, 30-year mortgage with a 4% interest rate will cost you $68,000 more over the life of the loan than a 15-year mortgage will. That's a lot of money you could use to build up your retirement fund or save for your kids' college.\"\nThe host of The Ramsey Show has another piece of advice about the size of a potential mortgage payment.\n\"Your monthly payment should not exceed 25% of your take-home pay. Any more than that will tie up too much of your income,\" he wrote.\nGet exclusive access to portfolio managers and their proven investing strategies with Real Money Pro.\nGet started now.

    "title": "Another former Soviet republic breaks away from Russia",
    "text": "A new conflict is arising in the post-Soviet region, as another former Soviet republic increasingly distances itself from Russia. Nikolai Sevostyanov highlighted two reasons for the rapid deterioration of Moscow’s relations with its historically allied nations.\nRelations between Russia and its seemingly allied nations, which share a common Soviet history, have become alarmingly complex. In this scenario, two primary factors are at play.\nFirstly, there is an escalating migration issue. The chaotic influx of migrants, primarily from the former Central Asian republics of the USSR, coupled with rising crime rates among these groups in Russia, is putting the traditionally cooperative relationships with countries like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and others at risk. At the very least, this tense situation results in increased disagreements and misunderstandings.\nSecondly, there is a political factor. Several neighboring countries are developing nationally oriented policies that, to varying degrees, are linked to a severing of past strong connections with Moscow. This troubling trend is vividly illustrated by the emergence of new history textbooks in Armenia, Uzbekistan, and elsewhere, as noted by Tsargrad host Elena Afonina during the program “We Are Aware.”\nShe discussed the prospects and challenges of Russia’s relationships with its post-Soviet allies with political scientist and orientalist Nikolai Sevostyanov.\nThe Dangerous Politics of Diasporas Initially, the expert addressed the issue of migrants. He believes that the current crisis exacerbates the influence of ethnic diasporas, which, through their lobbying power, effectively interfere with Russia’s migration policy:\nI am personally aware of instances where educated individuals from Dushanbe faced significant challenges moving to Russia. These challenges were often created by their own ethnic groups, known as diasporas. Conversely, individuals arriving from remote locations, especially crisis areas like the regions in Tajikistan near the Afghan border, typically receive necessary documentation without significant obstacles and often even apply for citizenship.\nHowever, the situation that follows is challenging for these migrant workers, who find themselves in an unfamiliar environment upon arriving in Russia.\nIf a person comes from a village that still mentally exists in the 19th century and suddenly finds themselves in Moscow City, they can be overwhelmed. It’s crucial to understand that this does not imply they were born different; the environmental factor significantly influences their experience, accentuating the stark contrast. The notion that migrants are somehow genetically inferior, as some propagate, is criminal and profoundly untrue.\n– explained the interlocutor of “First Russian.”\nHe pointed out that for many years, the domestic media, especially through comedy shows, has created a caricature of migrants as eccentric and subhuman:\nThis portrayal has backfired on us. It leads to an underestimation of those who come here. Newcomers may possess varying levels of education, upbringing, and values.\nEach newcomer has their own purpose in Russia. Sevostyanov noted that many migrant workers are subjected to sustained ideological indoctrination:\nOnce they arrive, they quickly come under the influence of radical preachers. They present a simplistic worldview: why, they ask, should you spend 30-40-50 years working here, hoping to leave something for your children, when you could obtain everything immediately? From the perspective of propagandists from international terrorist organizations, they frame Russians and Slavs as ‘kafirs’ or infidels, who supposedly have no right to ownership. They argue that Moscow was built not by Russians but by Allah, implying that Muslims, as the faithful, have a rightful claim to take it all.\nNikolay Sevostyanov stated that the threat posed by migrants has been underestimated in Russia for many years, as a distorted image of newcomers has been perpetuated through the media. Photo: Tsargrad\nIs There No More Soviet Legacy? Tsargrad’s interlocutor added that there are migrants who are relatively easy to recruit —this is largely a result of the socio-economic conditions in their home countries:\nIf conditions were favorable there, if functional socio-political institutions existed, and if there were adequate educational opportunities, those migrating to Russia would be better prepared for life here.\nRecruiters exploit the low standard of living that migrant workers are accustomed to, their educational deficits, and their lack of understanding of their new environment upon arriving in Moscow and other major Russian cities.\nInitially, when migrants from Central Asia came to Russia in the 1990s, they were prepared. While conditions in their home countries were dire, including a civil war in Tajikistan, they still identified with Soviet culture. Regardless of how one defines this term, they understood their destination. They recognized that Russia is a vast country and that Moscow is a modern city governed by specific rules. Today, many newcomers do not perceive such rules—they seek immediate gratification.\n– the political scientist elaborated.\nPhoto: Sergey Elagin/Globallookpress\nRussia is Being Squeezed Out of Transcaucasia and Central Asia Regarding the political aspect, countries like Armenia, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan promote a skewed image of Moscow as a colonizer through educational materials and the media, falsely portraying it as a power that historically extorted natural resources from peripheral regions.\nSevostyanov, however, emphasized that Russia has never been a colonial power; nearly all territories once part of the Russian Empire and subsequently the Soviet Union not only developed but often did so at the expense of original Russian territories:\nMoreover, those populations received—this was especially noticeable during the USSR—more agency than the Great Russian population. It was precisely these nations and republics that were actively reconstructed and later detached from the RSFSR, which benefitted significantly from the Union budget, receiving far more than they contributed. Specific figures illustrate this well: comparisons can be drawn between what individuals received from the budget in regions such as Voronezh or Orel versus what they received in Dushanbe or Yerevan.\nFurthermore, one can assess the developed industries, educational institutions, hospitals, and strong universities that Moscow established in these regions compared to their current state.\nDespite this, we now encounter textbooks presenting a distorted narrative. Who is responsible for this? It is those same international organizations that desire Russia to withdraw from the region, including culturally. Individuals who grow up learning from such materials develop entirely different mentalities. They often harbor no gratitude toward our citizens who welcomed them here. Quite the opposite, they feel entitled, alleging that we oppressed them, and now we owe them forever.\n– the orientalist commented.\nUzbekistan. Photo: Li Ao/Globallookpress\nHe believes this is evident, particularly in Armenia. Thus, another former Soviet republic is distancing itself from Russia. Meanwhile, a new conflict is brewing in the post-Soviet realm.\nToday, this country is definitively parting ways with Moscow, and it’s doing so to its own detriment. What does this separation mean for Armenia today? It essentially places Armenia under the influence of Turkey and Azerbaijan, escalating regional tensions, as I do not believe that the recent wars in Nagorno-Karabakh are the last ones. I clearly observe a tendency towards increasing strife, aimed at continuing this trajectory. Allowing such materials and narratives to take root in Armenia is, regrettably, digging their own grave.\n– the expert concluded.\nFor further details on the crises in relations with partners in the post-Soviet area, watch the video version of the program “We Are Aware.”\nkemerovo.tsargrad.tv\nA New War Is Coming to the Post-Soviet Space: Another Former Soviet Republic is Breaking Away from Russia Russia’s relations with seemingly allied countries, with which they share a common Soviet past, have become alarmingly complicated. Two main factors are contributing to the rapid deterioration of these relationships.\nChallenges in Migration Policies Firstly, migration has become a critical issue. The chaotic flow of newcomers, particularly from the former Central Asian republics of the USSR, has led to increased crime rates in Russia, further straining relations with traditional allies like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. This situation creates more disagreements and misunderstandings among the countries.\nEthnic Diasporas and National Policies Renowned political scientist Nikolai Sevostyanov highlights how the presence of ethnic diasporas complicates Russia’s migration policies. These groups tend to hold lobbying power:\n“Educated individuals from countries like Tajikistan may find it challenging to integrate due to barriers created by their own ethnic groups. In contrast, newcomers from remote areas often gain easier access to documentation and citizenship.”\nUpon arriving in Russia, many migrants encounter environments vastly different from their homes. As Sevostyanov points out:\n“When someone from a rural area is suddenly faced with the hustle and bustle of Moscow, it can be overwhelming. This disconnect is frequently misconstrued as a lack of ability or difference in nature, which is fundamentally incorrect.”\nMedia Influence and Misinformation The media has played a considerable role in shaping perceptions of migrants. They are often portrayed as caricatures, which only serves to minimize their importance and undervalue their diverse backgrounds:\n“The portrayal of migrants as merely humorous or eccentric figures has led to significant underestimation of their potential contributions.”\nPolitical Factors Undermining Alliances Secondly, the political climate is shifting in several former Soviet republics. A number of these nations are increasingly developing a nationally oriented agenda that encourages a distancing from Moscow. This transformation is evident in educational materials, with new history textbooks promoting anti-Russian sentiments in Armenia, Uzbekistan, and other republics.\nEducation and Identity in Former Soviet States Sevostyanov cites educational changes as a significant marker of this trend:\n“Textbooks are emerging that depict Moscow as a colonizing force, fostering a negative image of shared history, which in turn cultivates a sense of grievance amongst the population.”\nSocial and Economic Strains Migrants often arrive from challenging socio-economic backgrounds. Factors that enable their recruitment by extremist groups are notably linked to the conditions in their home countries:\n“The socio-economic instability and lack of educational opportunities lead to vulnerability among migrants, making them more susceptible to radicalization.”\nImpact on Integration and Security The stark difference in lifestyle and cultural norms can amplify tensions. Sevostyanov emphasizes:\n“The early cohorts of migrants were rooted in Soviet culture, understanding Russia’s complexities. Today’s newcomers often lack this context, leading to friction and misunderstandings.”\nStrategic Shifts in the Region As political narratives evolve, nations like Armenia appear to be making strategic decisions that could have detrimental effects on their stability:\n“Armenia’s distancing from Russia could leave it vulnerable to threats from Turkey and Azerbaijan, indicating a worrying trend of regional escalation.”\nThe Future of Russian Influence in Central Asia and the Caucasus Sevostyanov suggests that the increase of anti-Russian rhetoric in educational resources and media mirrors a broader departure from customary relationships:\n“This cultural shift is being orchestrated by international entities that favor Russia’s exit from the region. The resulting ideology fosters resentment and discontent among newer generations.”\nVisualizing the Shift: Comparative Perspectives Country Current Trend Historical Relations with Russia Armenia Increasing anti-Russian sentiment Traditionally close; recent estrangement Uzbekistan Shifting towards independent policy Former ally; re-evaluated ties Tajikistan Migration challenges and tensions Complex historical allegiance Key Takeaways from the Shift in Dynamics Migritation issues are critical in shaping current relationships. Political narratives increasingly depict Russia as a colonial power. Media representations play a significant role in public perception of migrants and Russia. Educational reforms may further alienate nations from Russian cultural influence.

    "text": "Must-See Michigan Winter Destinations: Mount Brighton [Jennifer Eberbach](/staff/4395666002/jennifer-eberbach/) EDITOR'S NOTE: Each year, journalists in some of Michigan's smaller markets put together a holiday series. This year, our writers wanted to share their favorite winter destinations, to give readers a bucket list for the cold months to come. [GENOA TOWNSHIP](https://www.genoa.org/) — Move over Colorado, there's a ski and snowboard lodge nestled right here in Michigan. And unlike your mountainous slopes, these can be conquered in a day. [Mount Brighton](https://www.mtbrighton.com/) doesn't try to compete with real mountains — it knows better. But the Vail Resorts-owned complex with 130 acres of skiable slopes is a must-visit destination because it's a great place to learn. General Manager Mike Giorgio said its size makes it \"accessible, not intimidating.\" Giorgio said people visit Mount Brighton to learn how to ski or brush up on their skills, sometimes to warm up for an out-of-state vacation. \"So many of our passholders grow up with places like Mount Brighton and hold those places in their heart and then take the next step to go out to Beaver Creek, Kirkwood, Stevens Pass, Whistler. I think that's what we, by design, are trying to create,\" he said. Mount Brighton is 1,330 feet above sea level at its highest point, with a base elevation of 1,100 feet. There are 24 trails, from beginner to intermediate to advanced, plus two terrain parks with jumps, rails, obstacles and other features. \"I think we have some of, if not the best, terrain parks,\" Giorgio said. \"They're probably our highest traffic areas.\" As a daytrip destination, Mount Brighton is about 20 minutes north of Ann Arbor and 43 miles east of Detroit. \"Accessibility to the highway is big, so we have a lot of people who come up from Toledo, and I absolutely think the same for someone from a little bit north of us,\" Giorgio said. \"There's plenty of lodging around Brighton, and Brighton is just a really good place to check out. We've got great dining. The restaurants are awesome.\" Must-See Michigan Winter Destinations: [Rosa Parks Ice Rink](/story/news/state/2023/12/27/must-see-michigan-winter-destinations-rosa-parks-ice-rink/71972638007/) A long history The land where Mount Brighton sits was originally farmland. The ski hill is man-made. The original hill, when it opened for the 1960-1961 season, was smaller than today, with one J-lift to take skiers up. The resort expanded and developed over the decades with more trails, chairlifts, a lodge with a lounge and dining. In 2012, Vail Resorts purchased the business and invested millions in renovations and equipment upgrades. Vail replaced the massive turbine-powered Schneehex snow cannon, nicknamed the \"snow witch,\" with dozens of smaller, state-of-the art snow guns for complete coverage. Vail also completely revamped the lodge and restaurant to mimic the style of western resorts. The main lodge has the Ski Hill Grill and Bruhn's Bar, and a modern-style fireplace. Customers can also visit Ore Creek Mountain Grill. \"As a company we’re invested in making the guest and employee experience the best we can,\" Giorgio said. \"That means building and maintaining strong infrastructure, updating the lodge, making sure we have the best snowmaking equipment, the best lifts, and the best beer on draft.\" Hours of operation at Mount Brighton are subject to change. For the early 2023-2024 season, the resort is open 3-9 p.m. Mondays-Fridays, 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Saturdays and 9 a.m.-8 p.m. Sundays. The ticket window opens 30 minutes prior. Special holiday hours are 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Dec. 26-Jan. 1, Jan. 14-15, and February 18-19. Lift tickets are available to purchase at the resort or in advance online at [mtbrighton.com/plan-your-trip/lift-access/tickets.aspx](https://www.mtbrighton.com/plan-your-trip/lift-access/tickets.aspx). An equipment rental and ski shop are available for visitors who need to gear up. The resort rents skis, ski boots, poles, snowboards and snowboard boots. The Chairlift Ski Shop has other gear for sale, including helmets, hats, goggles, socks, and base layer clothing. Lessons are offered to first-timers, children and adults. While Mount Brighton doesn't have on-site lodging, there are several hotels in the surrounding area. — Contact reporter Jennifer Eberbach at jeberbach@livingstondaily.com.",

    "text": "Doja Cat swiftly returned to social media following a hack where she dissed Iggy Azalea, revealing a fresh new look that captivated her fans. She posted a few casual snapshots on her Instagram account showcasing a ruffled haircut, some with a night vision filter and some without. Her followers were quick to shower her with compliments on her style, evident from the numerous fire emojis, impressed comments, and praises for her beauty and fashion sense on the IG post. It's evident that another transformation is on the horizon, as she prefers not to confine herself for too long. Doja Cat's fashion flair extends to her adeptness in handling wardrobe malfunctions during performances. A recent incident saw her turning a faulty mini-skirt mishap into a memorable moment by ripping it off mid-performance and channeling that frustration into her vocal delivery. While such mishaps are not uncommon among performers, few can claim to address them as uniquely and entertainingly as she did in this instance. However, performers often face challenges beyond their control when it comes to audience engagement during live shows. Doja Cat expressed visible disappointment during a recent tour when a festival crowd failed to sing along with her. While incidents of artists reacting to unresponsive crowds are not unheard of, the varying degrees of their reactions can range from measured to extreme.\nDespite this, it's understandable how disheartening it can be for artists when faced with such situations. Meanwhile, Doja Cat is likely to continue experimenting with her styles despite facing criticism, including a recent tirade from Azealia Banks. She has remained unfazed by trolls thus far, and it seems unlikely that this will change anytime soon. The question remains whether her evolving looks will coincide with new music or if they are merely personal style choices unrelated to her artistry. Either way, her style choices are bold, and we are here for it.",

    "text": "El superintendente de Comunicaciones de la Itaipú Binacional, José Luis Rodríguez Tornaco, destacó los resultados que arrojaron la medición realizada por la consultora Consumer Intelligence (COIN) que señalan que la binacional es una de las instituciones más creíbles de la percepción de la ciudadanía. “Es una tremenda satisfacción y responsabilidad”, expresó en comunicación con la radio 650 AM. Al respecto, mencionó que la entidad mostró a la ciudadanía los trabajos que vienen realizando constantemente. “Hemos decidido mostrarle a la gente todo lo que hace normalmente la Itaipú en materia de infraestructura, atención médica, provisión de agua, las becas del Gobierno Nacional, todo eso hizo que hoy la gente nos premie con la evaluación de ser la entidad pública más confiable”, apuntó.

Negociaciones Por otra parte, se refirió a las negociaciones entre los gobiernos de Paraguay y Brasil en torno a la tarifa energética y la revisión del Anexo C del Tratado de Itaipú, en las cuales ya se ha logrado un gran avance. Al respecto, indicó que esto también representa una gran responsabilidad con la credibilidad ante la ciudadanía. “Es una gran responsabilidad porque hace 50 años, unos paraguayos de bien fueron capaces de sentarse a firmar y a discutir de par a par con el Brasil, y en igualdad de condiciones, un tratado que cambió la historia de Paraguay. Hoy el presidente de la República, Santiago Peña, los consejeros y directores de Itaipú están liderando un sistema de conversaciones con el Brasil, que lo que busca es dejar las bases para los próximos 50 años”, manifestó.
