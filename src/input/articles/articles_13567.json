    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has been trying to frame the November election around two subjects: his legislative accomplishments and former President Donald Trump’s fitness to serve.\nBut Biden’s own vulnerabilities have been getting in the way. High among them for many voters is a sense that the country is in chaos, fueled in part by images of an\noverwhelmed southern border that have flooded television screens and social media feeds since he took office.\nkAm“%96 76?E2?J= E92E :D 4@>:?8 24C@DD E96 3@C56C :D 4@>:?8 :?E@ @FC 4@>>F?:E:6D[” D2:5 $6?] r2E96C:?6 r@CE6K |2DE@[ 2 s6>@4C2E 7C@> }6G252[ H96C6 q:56? :D 5@H? 3J 2? 2G6C286 @7 e A6C46?E286 A@:?ED E@ %CF>A[ :? 2? :?E6CG:6H] “%96 9F>2?

    "text": "Hyderabad: Amid ruckus over the alleged irregularities in the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project, Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy launched a scathing attack against the family of former CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, accusing them of being the \"true enemies\" of the state.\nThe CM said that he would present detailed facts and documents related to the Kaleshwaram Project within two days.\nHe also ruled out the possibility of anyone from the KCR family being inducted into the Congress.\n\"As long as I am in power, there will be no entry for KCR's family into Congress,\" Reddy said.\nPunjabi Social Media Influencer Kamal Kaur Found Dead In Parked Car In Bathinda's Adesh Medical...\nHe further accused Union Minister G Kishan Reddy of obstructing Telangana's development, calling him \"the biggest hurdle to the state's progress.\"\n\"Kishan Reddy is the biggest hurdle to Telangana's progress,\" Reddy said.\nSpeaking about BRS MLC Kalvakuntla Kavitha's letter to her father, KCR, the Telangana CM labelled it a \"film-style drama\" for attention.\nEarlier, Kavitha took potshots at the leaders of her party. Without naming anyone, she said that when her father, KCR, received notices in relation to the Kaleshwaram probe, no plan of action was set up.\nBengaluru Road Rage: Woman Hurls Abuses At Bleeding Biker After Car-Bike Collision Outside Petrol...\n\"When KCR is given notices, there is no action plan.

    "text": "Maguindanao del Norte, Philippines — From being adversaries, soldiers and combatants of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are now allies in ensuring the success of the peace process in Mindanao as members of the joint peace and security committee (JPSC).\nAt a recent interview held at the JPSC office in Barangay Datu Odin Sinsuat in this province, retired Maj. Gen. Francisco Felicidario III of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Von Al Haq of the MILF provided their perspectives on the progress of the peace process in Mindanao.\n“It’s no longer Mindanao at war. It’s a Mindanao in progress and development,” Al Haq said.\nHe noted the shift in discussions from confict to peace in the area.\nAl Haq cited the equitable distribution of peace dividends among various sectors due to the positive impact of peace negotiations.\nHe highlighted the role of the JSPC in maintaining peace and order as a product of peace negotiations.\nFelicidario cited significant improvements in security and mobility compared to previous years.\n“We’re getting there. We’re seeing a lot different from before this,” he said. ”You wouldn’t be here if we were in those times.”\nFelicidario stressed the need to sustain the gains of the peace process, citing the collective responsibility of stakeholders in securing lasting peace.\nHe mentioned ongoing discussions in the security cluster of the government discouraging the use of “conflict-affected areas.”\n“They would want to erase the term ‘conflict-affected areas’ and be more representative of the peace that everybody is enjoying now and the development that’s being enjoyed,” Felicidario said.\nThe JPSC is composed of 15 members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), eight from the Philippine National Police and seven from the AFP. The committee was established since the start of the peace negotiations in the Bangsamoro region in 2019.\nIt has also continued its efforts as first responders to emergencies.\nAlmish Guimba, a former BIAF staff member, noted the transformative impact of peace negotiations on his family’s life, including opportunities for education and growth of former MILF combatants.",

    "text": "TRE-SP cassa mandatos do prefeito e da vice-prefeita de Barueri\nO Tribunal Regional Eleitoral de São Paulo (TRE-SP) decidiu reverter uma decisão de primeira instância e cassar nesta terça, 8, os mandatos do prefeito de Barueri (SP), Beto Piteri (Republicanos) e da vice-prefeita, Dra. Claudia (PSB), por uso indevido dos meios de comunicação social. Piteri e o ex-prefeito, Rubens Furlan (PSB), também foram condenados a oito anos de inelegibilidade.\nDe acordo com a decisão da Justiça Eleitoral, o uso indevido dos meios de comunicação social se deu pela divulgação de vídeos impulsionados no perfil de Rubens Furlan no Instagram. Os materiais divulgavam a campanha eleitoral da chapa eleita e depreciavam o candidato oponente, Gil Arantes (União).\nEm seu voto, o relator Regis de Castilho Barbosa Filho escreveu que Beto e Cláudia foram marcados nas publicações impulsionadas, motivo pelo qual não poderiam \"alegar desconhecimento das publicidades em favor de suas campanhas eleitorais, mesmo porque são apadrinhados políticos do autor das publicações, Rubens Furlan\".\nOs três eram também acusados de abuso de poder econômico, mas o tribunal decidiu que o montante investido na divulgação dos vídeos não pode ser considerado exorbitante e desmedido, características essenciais para a configurar a irregularidade.\nO juiz relator determinou cumprimento imediato da decisão. O TRE-SP informou que, como cabe recurso junto ao Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), os recorrentes podem pedir efeito suspensivo à determinação de cumprimento imediato, para que permaneçam no cargo até o julgamento do recurso.\nNo caso de afastamento do prefeito e sua vice, o presidente da Câmara Municipal assume a prefeitura.\nEm seu perfil no Instagram, o prefeito Beto Piteri afirmou ter recebido o julgamento \"com tranquilidade\", porque a decisão \"não é definitiva\". \"Nós vamos agora para o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, em Brasília, onde vai decidir definitivamente os destinos da nossa cidade. Você já decidiu, sua família já decidiu. A democracia vai prevalecer\", disse em vídeo publicado na plataforma.",

    "title": "‘They’re not taking the same exam:’ Van Jones points out the double standard between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris",
    "text": "Van Jones recently hit the nail on the head by succinctly describing the double standardbetween Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\nWith Election Day less than two weeks away, polls are still predicting an incredibly tight race between Trump and Harris. However, it shouldn’t be tight at all. Harris has a history as a capable and experienced leader with an impressive legal and political career. As President, she has promised to protect women’s rights, give tax breaks to the middle class and small businesses, expand the child tax credit, make healthcare accessible, and promote gun safety regulations. Meanwhile, billionaire corrupt businessman and convicted felon Trump wants to abolish the Department of Education, defund Planned Parenthood, defund schools that teach about slavery , spark the “largest deportation” in U.S. history , and give tax cuts to billionaires. Not only that, but he is allegedly tied to Project 2025, which lays out a plan for banning abortion nationally and dismantling democracy in America. Yet, there’s a chance that Trump could take home the election.\nFinally, Jones came forward to call out the blatant double standard for the presidential candidates.\nVan Jones nails the double standard in the presidential election On October 23, CNN political commentator Jones spoke out about the unfair dynamics in the presidential election. The discussion arose after Harris partook in a Pennsylvania town hall with undecided voters. Strategist David Axelrod later analyzed her performance and noted she had very strong moments and was “well-prepared.” However, he did criticize her occasional “word salad,” in which she’d get off track when asked certain questions, such as about the Israel-Hamas War. Of course, all the media focused on was the one “word salad” criticism. Numerous outlets quickly reported that Harris was brutally “roasted” for her “word salad,” while right-wing pundits laughed and screamed about her supposed incompetence and how she was unqualified to be President.\nHowever, Jones defended her, pointing out the apparent double standard in the race. He stated plainly, “Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are not taking the same exam. And I think it bothers people. They’re not taking the same exam.” The major problem is that Harris is held to an incredibly high standard while Trump is held to no standard. Jones explained, “He gets to be lawless. She has to be flawless. That’s what’s unfair.”\nVan Jones: “Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are not taking the same exam. And I think it bothers people. They’re not taking the same exam. He gets to be lawless. She has to be flawless. That’s what’s unfair.”\npic.twitter.com/EBWNqKlavf\n— Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) October 24, 2024 Jones’ statement quickly started trending on X because it so plainly and simply called out the truth. For example, he references Trump’s bizarre comments about Arnold Palmer’s penis . He acknowledged that Harris might occasionally stumble while speaking, but “she’s fighting for actual ideas that will help real people, and he’s talking about peoples’ penises.” As if that wasn’t proof enough of the double standard, at the same time the media was having a field day over Harris’ “word salad,” Trump received his umpteenth sexual assault allegation and was accused of defending Hitler and making horrific racist remarks about the late Vanessa Guillén.\nLISTEN FOR FREE: Top-rated Progressive shows on SiriusXM Progress\nOf course, MAGA doesn’t care that their candidate is a convicted felon displaying increasingly erratic and bizarre behavior while new skeletons are discovered in his closet by the minute. They’re too busy policing Harris’ supposed teleprompter use and trying to figure out what earrings she’s wearing . It’s not just MAGA, though. Democrats and liberals also have high expectations for Harris, just as they had high standards for Biden and called him out when he displayed an inability to lead. While it’s good that the left cares about who their candidate is, it still adds to the double standard. Harris faces high standards from her supporters and impossible standards from the right, and Trump enjoys zero standards from both sides. Trump could do literally anything and still earn MAGA’s praise, while most Democrats have, sadly, had to resign themselves to not expecting anything but the worst from him.\nThe fact that this unfairness is encroaching on the presidential election is emblematic of a much larger problem within America of holding women and BIPOC individuals to different standards than men and Caucasians. There is no greater indication of the urgent need for change when the archaic notion of expecting perfection from women while chanting, “Boys will be boys,” is playing out in the race for the highest office in America.",

Before the war, having a young woman in charge of an all-male Ukrainian military unit might have given the troops pause.
