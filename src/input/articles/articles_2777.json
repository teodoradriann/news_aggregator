    "text": "Russian vlogger visits Mumbai&#039;s Siddhivinayak Temple: &#039;Truly special day&#039;. Watch A Russian vlogger recently visited Mumbai&#039;s Siddhivinayak temple and took to social media to share her experience. Mariia Chugurova narrated her experience of visiting the iconic shrine in an Instagram video, referring to the visit as &quot;a truly special day&quot;. &quot;Namaste dosto. Today was a truly special day as I had the opportunity to visit one of Mumbai’s most revered and iconic landmarks: The Siddhi Vinayak Temple,&quot; the vlogger wrote in the caption. Detailing her experience of visiting the temple, the vlogger spoke about how all the devotees moved very quickly and admitted that the feeling of visiting the temple as one that was hard to explain. &quot;Today I’m coming to the most famous temple in Mumbai, Siddhivinayak.&quot; &quot;Even when it’s so crowded, so many people, everybody pushing you, everybody trying to move you because you need to do this very fast. But you still have such a blessed feeling. You can’t explain this,&quot; she said in the video. The vlogger further said that while joining the queue of devotees, she could feel &quot;a profound sense of connection&quot; with everyone around her. &quot;The energy within the temple was palpable, and the sense of community was heartwarming. It was a reminder of the power of faith and the unifying force of shared beliefs. Joining the long queue of devotees, I felt a profound sense of connection with everyone around me, each person carrying their hopes, dreams, and prayers.&quot; &quot;I left the temple with a heart full of blessings and a mind at peace, grateful for the experience and the chance to be part of something so timeless and beautiful!&quot; she added in the caption.",

    "text": "You step on the scale, hoping for a change, any change. But the number stares back, unwavering. Sound familiar? You're not alone. Millions struggle with the frustrating question: \"Why can't I lose weight?\" It's easy to get lost in a sea of fad diets, celebrity endorsements (Robert Pattinson on a potato diet, anyone?), and conflicting information. Let's ditch the confusion and explore what really works for sustainable weight loss, especially that stubborn belly fat. Beyond the Scale: It's Not Just About the Number First things first, your weight is just one data point in the larger picture of your health. Don't let it define you! Focus on feeling your best, having energy, and improving your overall well-being. Debunking Common Weight Loss Myths Let's clear the air about some popular weight loss beliefs that might be holding you back: - Myth: All calories are created equal. - Reality: 100 calories of broccoli and 100 calories of chips are processed very differently by your body. Focus on nutrient-dense foods that keep you full and satisfied. - Myth: Carbs are the enemy. - Reality: Your body needs carbs for energy! Choose complex carbs like whole grains and fruits over refined carbs like white bread and sugary drinks. - Myth: You need to do hours of intense exercise. - Reality: Consistency is key. Find activities you enjoy and can stick with long-term, even if it's just a brisk walk every day. The Protein Puzzle: Too Much of a Good Thing? You've probably heard that protein is crucial for weight loss, and it's true! Protein helps you feel full, builds muscle, and boosts your metabolism. But, as with anything, too much protein can be counterproductive, especially on certain diets like the ketogenic diet. \"Did you know eating too much protein can throw you out of ketosis? Depending on how your body reacts, you can intake more or less protein once you're used to a high-fat diet. It's better to be cautious when starting out on a keto diet. If you eat too much protein while on this diet, your body will go through a process called gluconeogenesis. If you eat too much protein, your body will convert it into glucose and store it as fat. You'll feel pretty weak, sluggish, and sick, and worse yet, you'll be kicked out of ketosis. So if you have visions of plate after plate of grilled chicken, think again. When you're shopping at a restaurant, you need super fats: think steak with a good marbling of fat, avocado and oil-rich salads, and a few pieces of bacon on the side.\" Finding What Works for You There's no one-size-fits-all approach to weight loss. What works for your best friend or that fitness influencer you follow might not be the right fit for you. Here's how to create a personalized plan: - Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how different foods make you feel. Do you have more energy after a salad or after a burger and fries? - Experiment: Don't be afraid to try different types of exercise and find what you enjoy. Maybe Zumba is your jam, or perhaps you prefer a peaceful hike in nature. - Be Patient and Kind to Yourself: Weight loss is a journey, not a race. There will be ups and downs. Celebrate your victories, big and small, and don't beat yourself up over setbacks. Ditch the Diet Vlog Comparisons Speaking of journeys, it's easy to fall into the trap of comparing your progress to what you see online. Remember, those perfectly edited diet vlogs and before-and-after photos don't always tell the whole story. Focus on your progress, your goals, and your unique path to a healthier, happier you.

    "text": "PA Media: UK News Protest at Catholic girls school a sign of ‘deeper malaise’ in Northern Ireland Read full article Gráinne Ní Aodha, PA 29 December 2023 at 2:01 am · 4-min read\nA loyalist protest at a Catholic girls school in north Belfast in 2001 was a sign of a “deeper malaise” in Northern Ireland according to Bertie Ahern, new archives show.\nOfficials who compiled documentation of efforts to resolve the protest also noted criticisms of DUP MP for Belfast North Nigel Dodds for his actions, and said that then First Minister David Trimble’s efforts were integral.\nFor months in 2001, locals at Holy Cross primary school in north Belfast stood outside the school as girls and parents walked in\nIrish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern talks with Father Aidan Troy, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of Holy Cross Primary School, Ardoyne, Northern Ireland, at Government buildings in Dublin (Chris Bacon/PA) The protest began following a clash in June 2001 as a man collected his child.\n“He was, according to nationalists, attacked by loyalists when he objected to them putting up paramilitary flags on the Ardoyne Road,” a briefing note stated.\nEfforts to resolve the issue over the summer break failed, and the protests resumed in the autumn.\nLoyalists said they were protesting because of attacks on their community, which they claimed were prompted by the larger Catholic population and wanted better security in the Ardoyne area as a result.\nThe note from November said: “The hate-filled aggression the loyalist protesters showed to the primary school girls and their families has disturbed, dismayed, and angered people throughout Northern Ireland and in the wider world beyond.”\nOn October 18 2001, Fr Aidan Troy had an hour-long meeting with Mr Ahern in which he discussed the impasse over the protest, which had been ongoing for months.\nFr Troy, parish priest of Ardoyne and chair of the board of governors of the Holy Cross school, said that there were around 20 people on both sides of the road in the morning, and 60-70 people on each side in the afternoon.\nAn armed policeman by his vehicle, as security was tightened for the ongoing Loyalist protest against catholic schoolchildren going to Holy Cross Primary School in North Belfast (Paul Faith/PA) “A hard core” of local residents took part in the protests and there was also a “sinister” loyalist paramilitary involvement, as well as people from other loyalist areas taking part, according to notes taken of the meeting.\nFr Troy said that some residents from Glenbryn, the protestant and loyalist area around the school, expressed support for his work, usually anonymously because of the “climate of fear” surrounding those who opposed the protest.\nStory continues He said that some children and parents had been subjected to abuse including “balloons filled with dog excrement and urine, scalding water, stones and a blast-bomb”.\nA blast bomb attack had taken place the day before the meeting on Alliance Avenue.\nOf the 220 pupils at the school, 35 were stressed and receiving counselling and medication, and 10 had been transferred to other schools.\nThe priest expressed concern that the protest could “drag on indefinitely”, as it was a no-cost effort from protesters, and said this could put an “intolerable strain” on the school community.\nHe also said that there was “a leadership vacuum” in Glenbryn, which was an impediment to progress, and the referral to a committee of 14 people with “no common agenda” made it difficult to find a resolution.\nFr Troy also said that while he appreciated the work of police to protect children on the way to school, he was “unhappy” that protesters were allowed to be so close that they were able to “spit at the children” and was confused as to why armed soldiers faced towards the parents and children.\nMr Ahern said that the root causes of the protests were a “symptom of a deeper malaise within Northern Ireland”.\nProtestant residents protest behind an RUC cordon as they demonstrate against pupils and parents making their way to the Holy Cross Girls School in Belfast (John Giles/PA) He offered to raise the issue during a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair the next day, but said that genuine progress could only be achieved through engagement and agreement at local level.\nFergal Mythen, an Irish official in the Security Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, compiled the notes of the meeting on October 22 2001.\nIn notes taken by the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat, dated November 21, it said Fr Troy was “reasonably confident” of an end or suspension to the protest ahead of a meeting with Mr Trimble and deputy first minister Mark Durkan.\nMr Dodds, who was to chair a meeting of residents at Stormont, was noted as a sign of a possible deal, as “Dodds has sat on the loyalist fence on may issues and is not known to stick his neck out unduly”.\nIn a briefing dated November 26, it called Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan’s meeting with Glenbryn residents the previous week, as well as a prompt follow-up letter “instrumental in creating the climate for a discontinuation of the protest”.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/53/67.\nTRENDING Davina McCall stormed off Masked Singer after close friend was

He threatened to set the train on fire if they (Ayodhya pilgrims) continue chanting Ram bhajans and Jai Shri Ram slogans. When the passengers tried to catch hold of him, he jumped out of the train and escaped,” the complaint stated.\nThe Railway police have taken up a case under IPC sections 504, 506 and 295(a).\nSources said the suspect was arrested on the outskirts of Gadag. But the police have not confirmed the arrest yet.\nOn Thursday night, after the incident, the passengers of the Aastha special train staged a protest at Hosapete railway station. The agaitating Ram devotees said they would not allow the train to proceed until the suspect is arrested. SP\nSriharibabu and local BJP leaders managed to pacify the protesters, after which the train continued its onward journey.\nMeanwhile, taking no chances, the police security was beefed up around the railway station. More than 100 police personnel and homeguards were deployed at the railway station on Friday.\nJoshi demands action\nUnion Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi on Friday urged the state government to arrest those who allegedly threatened the passengers returning from Ayodhya, at Hosapete on Thursday night, reports DHNS from Hubballi.\nSpeaking to media persons here on Friday, Joshi said, “Criminals feel safe whenever the Congress comes to power.
