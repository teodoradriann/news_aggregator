    "text": "By Athena Stavrou ,\n2 minutes ago\nThunderstorms and heavy rain are set to hit large swathes of the UK on Sunday just one day after Saturday could possibly be the hottest day of the year so far.\nSaturday is predicted to see temperatures rise as high as 26C in parts of south-east England , including around London, in what would be the hottest day of the year.\nHowever the hot weather could be short lived as a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms is set to come into place on Sunday.\nImpacting large swathes of Wales and western England from north to south, the warning will come into place from midday on Sunday and remain until 10pm.\nThe warning comes with a possibility of flooding, travel delays and power cuts.\nHeavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north whilst growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area,” the Met Office said.\n“Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over 2 to 3 hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.”\nMore follows on this news story....\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "(screengrab) Category: Big on the Internet Alarming New Allegations Against MrBeast Arise From Former Employee Alexandria Lopez | Published: Aug 8, 2024 04:11 pm\nAmid the backlash against the inhumane conditions Beast Games contestants were reportedly forced to endure, even more allegations have been made against MrBeast, also known as Jimmy Donaldson. These new allegations come from a notable source: one of his past employees.\nRecommended Videos Earlier this month, YouTuber Rosanna Pansino revealed several accounts from both current and eliminated Beast Games contestants , who claimed they were being deprived of food, water, sleep, sanitary products, and medical aid. Now, former MrBeast employee Jake Weddle exposed what it’s like to work under YouTube’s most subscribed creator during his collaboration with DogPack404 on the video “I Worked for MrBeast, He’s a Sociopath.”\nJake Weddle revealed horrible working conditions while with MrBeast Several allegations were made against Donaldson during the interview. One viral moment from the video came when Weddle claimed that the MrBeast crew wouldn’t let him sleep and refused to let him turn off the lights during a video shoot.\nHe claimed that he had asked if they would have time for themselves at night. Weddle was denied this, as they claimed it would ruin the time-lapse shots. As he was stuck in a room, Weddle had no access to sunlight or a clock, and lights were on the whole time. He was given melatonin, which did not help. Because of this, Weddle developed insomnia.\nAfter opening up to a friend that they wouldn’t let him turn off the lights, his friend described the situation as a war crime. Weddle claimed it was “24 hours of breaking the Geneva Convention, I guess.” MrBeast reportedly checked on him every other day for an hour.\nAnother allegation that garnered attention was Weddle’s claim that MrBeast and his team knowingly hired a registered sex offender. He claimed Donaldson did his best to cover up any potential scandal to preserve his image. Weddle reveals he heard rumors that the employee in question was on the sex offenders registry due to inappropriate actions against a minor. This is extremely troubling, as his job with MrBeast has him working in an environment where underage people may be present.\nWhen tangible proof arose of the employee’s crimes, Donaldson’s team reportedly covered up the situation. The person in question was reportedly in videos and thumbnails but was always wearing a mask to cover his face and conceal his identity. Weddle claimed he was given the nickname “Delaware” because he was not allowed to go back to the state.\nIn the same video, DogPack404 had an accusation against a member of MrBeast’s team—the cameraman, who he did not name. He claimed that during the “100 Boys Vs 100 Girls” video, several women have come forward and claimed that he had made them uncomfortable. DogPack404 then accused the cameraman of trapping these girls in a circle, forcing them to sleep on rough turf, and attempting to get them on high on paint fumes. He then accused the cameraman of trying to sexually assault these women.\nPreviously, DogPack404 released a video titled “I Worked for MrBeast, He’s a Fraud,” which accused Donaldson of running illegal lotteries and faking his videos. He also accused the creator of selling fake signatures.\nAs of this writing, MrBeast has not responded to the latest allegations.",

    "text": "WESTBROOK, Maine — The family that owns Smiling Hill Farm is doing its best to protect a bee colony that has occupied a farmhouse for decades.\nThe Knight family said a hive with more than 40,000 bees grew within the walls of a home on their property.\nAdvertisement The farmhouse is in need of renovation but instead of killing the bees, the Knight family wanted to save the colony.\n\"For sixty-plus years, there's been bees in this house and it might be longer than that. It might be seventy or eighty,\" said Michael Knight.\nOn Thursday, Andrew MacDonald of Bee Huggah came to Smiling Hill Farm to safely relocate the bees from the farmhouse.\n\"I believe that these bees are worth saving for a number of different reasons,\" MacDonald said. \"They have medicinal value and they pollinate our crops.\"\nMacDonald moved the bees to a hive outside of the farmhouse.\nKnight said Smiling Hill Farm will maintain the outdoor hive. He hopes the bee colony will survive the winter so that it can be relocated somewhere else on the farm.\nTop Picks Rossen roundup: Top consumer stories from the past week New documentary chronicles the history of lowrider car culture Rossen Reports: Protect yourself after Change Healthcare data breach How to find early Amazon Prime Big Deal Days deals from small businesses",

    "title": "Lenovo tops Asia Pacific supply chain ranking for fourth year",
    "text": "Lenovo has maintained its top position in the Gartner Asia/Pacific Supply Chain Top 10 for 2025, the fourth consecutive year it has led the ranking among companies in the APAC region.\nThe list compiled by Gartner recognises supply chain performance across several criteria, highlighting adaptability to growth, use of technology for efficiency and resilience, and sustainability efforts including circular innovation. Lenovo's placement reflects the company's ongoing transformation of its global supply chain and manufacturing network. The 2025 report also placed Lenovo at number eight in Gartner's Global Supply Chain Top 25, an improvement of two spots compared to the previous year.\nThe recognition has been attributed to Lenovo's focus on AI, operational standards, and environmental, social and governance goals. According to Lenovo, these areas have strengthened its presence as a major organisation in global supply chain innovation and adaptability.\nGlobal supply chain\nLenovo's supply chain operates in 180 markets and includes over 30 manufacturing sites across 11 different countries. This global reach has been described as being a crucial asset for managing both geopolitical and economic challenges in recent years.\nTo support customers in the Middle East and Africa, Lenovo is planning to expand its manufacturing base into Saudi Arabia. The company said that this development will extend its regional footprint, capitalise on market opportunities in MEA, and allow faster delivery of products and services for customers in those markets.\nCommenting on the announcement, Amar Babu, President of Lenovo Asia Pacific, said:\n\"It's an honor to be named No. 1 in Asia Pacific for the fourth year and moving up in the global rankings is a powerful validation of our efforts to build a smarter, more resilient supply chain. From AI-powered tools to sustainable logistics, our innovations are helping customers and partners gain an operational edge in a dynamic world.\"\nInvestment in the manufacturing footprint and supply chain network, according to Lenovo, reinforces its ability to remain agile in response to shifts in the global business environment while maintaining service standards.\nAI adoption\nA central element of Lenovo's strategy is the \"Lenovo Powers Lenovo\" approach, using in-house technology and infrastructure to upgrade core operations. The company has increased the use of AI across its supply chain, affecting areas such as manufacturing processes, logistics, sustainability reporting, and customer service functions.\nLenovo has internally developed an AI-enabled tool that provides real-time risk notifications and automates decision-making across its supply chain. The tool is designed to detect disruptions, such as congestion in logistics routes, and then suggest and evaluate alternative logistics options along with related costs. This aim is to support faster and more efficient responses to supply chain challenges as they occur.\nSustainability\nSupply chain leaders in the APAC region have increasingly prioritised sustainability, with a particular emphasis on circular approaches. Lenovo reports integration of recycled materials into over 298 of its product lines, including the adoption of carbon fibre sourced from aircraft manufacturing by-products. Product packaging has also seen changes, with the company using materials derived from sugar cane and bamboo in a bid to promote responsible manufacturing.\nIn addition to its overall ranking, Lenovo received the number three position in the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 and Masters for 2025: High Tech Top 10 ranking.\nThe Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2025 was delivered in research reports dated July 2025, authored by Teh Leng Tan, Sergio Coelho, Alejandro Santalo, and Cori Masters, and in methodology and commentary specified by Gartner. Gartner's methodology assesses companies based on a range of capability, leadership, and performance metrics.\nGartner's official stance notes that the company does not endorse any vendor, product or service featured in its publications. All research represents the views of the Gartner research division and should not be interpreted as statements of fact. Gartner also disclaims express or implied warranties in relation to its findings.",

    "text": "Mining giant Rio Tinto has signed a massive solar and battery storage deal with Australian company Edify Energy that helps secure the future of its Gladstone-based smelter and refineries that are among the country’s biggest consumers of energy.\nThe deal with Edify Energy is particularly significant as it includes a giant battery, sized at 600 MW and 2,400 MWh, that helps fill the gap for “dispatchable” generation to ensure that the Boyne Island smelter and the Yarwun alumina refinery have power when they need it.\nRio Tinto had already signed the two biggest renewable energy power purchase agreements, with the proposed 1.4 GW Bungaban wind project and the 1.2 GW Upper Calliope solar project, and the deal with Edify will include 600 MW of solar from the neighbouring Smoky Creek and Guthrie’s Gap solar farms, as well as the battery.\n“These agreements are integral to repowering our Gladstone aluminium operations with affordable, reliable and lower carbon energy for decades to come,” Rio Tinto Australian chief executive Kellie Parker said in a statement.\n“For the first time, we have integrated crucial battery storage in our efforts to make the Boyne aluminium smelter globally cost-competitive, as traditional energy sources become more expensive.\n“We continue to investigate further renewable energy investments to repower our Gladstone aluminium operations.”\nmore to follow",

    "text": "Charlie Dalin, dans le petit matin vendéen, coupe la ligne de la victoire de sa vie. Collé au bateau, le zodiaque de l'assistance technique, dans lequel se trouve Guillaume, le polynésien, sera le premier à monter à bord. \"Après s'être embrassés et laisser vivre notre émotion, on a tous été faire un tour du bateau pour voir si quelque chose nous sautait aux yeux\" explique Guillaume Combescure, Directeur Technique Imoca Macif Santé Prévoyance . \"La majorité des problèmes, on en avait connaissance, parce que Charlie nous en avait informés\".\nUne victoire dans le Vendée Globe se prépare pendant des années. La compétition océanique est un sport mécanique, et par essence, un sport collectif. Pour Guillaume, cette victoire de Charlie est donc aussi, un peu la sienne. \"Elle est à moi, elle est à nous tous, chaque membre de l'équipe, et de celle qui a fabriqué le bateau, même les sponsors. C'est génial. Il n'y a pas de débat là dessus.\nCharlie Dalin, premier sur la ligne d’arrivée, pulvérise le temps de référence de neuf jours • ©Nefsea Production Guillaume Combescure, architecte de la performance Charlie Dalin, le vainqueur du Vendée Globe 2024/2025 confirme avoir travaillé \"avec une super équipe, les meilleurs du monde. Benj, Math, Guillaume, c'est tous des champions du monde. Le bateau est incroyable. Ils ont été dans un détail fou de préparation. J'avais vraiment un bijou entre les mains pour faire ce tour du monde\".\nLe navigateur normand de 40 ans a remporté, mardi, la 10ᵉ édition de la course autour du monde en solitaire, sans escale et sans assistance. Yoann Richomme, son ami et rival depuis vingt ans, devait prendre la deuxième place. • ©Nefsea Production\nDans ce grand barnum de l'arrivée, les deux hommes ont pourtant trouvé quelques instants, pour eux. Charlie et Guillaume ont su élever leur niveau de compétences. Pour le marin d'Arue, architecte de la performance, chaque détail compte. Depuis la conception jusqu'aux quelques ajustements qui ont suivi sa mise à l'eau. \"Cela fait 3 ans qu'on travaille ensemble, on a appris à se connaître et ce Vendée là, nous a permis de nous connaître mieux\" confirme Guillaume Combescure. \"C'est un gars qui fait confiance à son équipe. Quant au marin, il est jusqu'au boutiste, il a eu la hargne pendant toute la compétition. Donc pour l'équipe technique, c'est trés agrèable\".\n©polynesie Avec Eric Cintas",

    "text": "Canicule : six départements du Sud en vigilance orange pour vendredi, jusqu’à 38 °C attendus\nMétéo France prévoit un « épisode caniculaire non exceptionnel mais assez durable, nécessitant une vigilance particulière notamment pour les personnes sensibles ou exposées ».\nC’était attendu. Météo France a placé six départements du sud de la France, des Pyrénées-Orientales aux Bouches-du-Rhône, en vigilance orange pour canicule pour la journée de vendredi. Le département des Pyrénées-Orientales\nest lui déjà en vigilance orange canicule pour ce jeudi. L’Aude, l’Hérault, le Gard et le Vaucluse viendront compléter cette liste dès vendredi.\nL’institut météorologique prévoit ainsi un « épisode caniculaire non exceptionnel mais assez durable, nécessitant une vigilance particulière notamment pour les personnes sensibles ou exposées ». Jusqu’à 38 °C est attendu vendredi « en plaine », précise-t-il.\nCes fortes chaleurs installées sur le pourtour méditerranéen « vont se maintenir encore plusieurs jours », y compris pendant les nuits qui vont rester « particulièrement chaudes ». En plaine, vendredi, les températures minimales seront souvent comprises entre 22 et 25 °C ; les températures maximales entre 33 et 38 °C, toujours selon Météo France.\nCe jeudi après-midi déjà, des températures élevées et en hausse ont été relevées : 36,1 °C à Perpignan, 36,5 °C à Céret, 37,3 °C à Béziers, 37,5 °C à Pézenas ou encore 35,5 °C à Calvi, en Corse. Sept départements du sud seront par ailleurs vendredi sous le signe d’une alerte jaune canicule : les Alpes-Maritimes et le Var, les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, la Drôme et l’Ardèche ainsi que les deux départements de la Corse.\nVers une vague de chaleur ?\nL’ensemble du pays sera pour sa part touché par une hausse des températures ce week-end et en début de semaine prochaine. « Cette chaleur se renforcera dimanche avec la remontée d’une masse d’air encore plus chaud sur le pays », précise\nMétéo France. Les températures pourraient notamment atteindre 31 °C samedi et 33 °C dimanche à Paris. Dans le détail, l’« épisode de chaleur » sera « durable » dans le Sud-Est, quand son pic « est à ce jour prévu pour la journée de lundi » en Île-de-France et dans le nord-est du pays.\nD’après\nLa Chaîne Météo, la durée précise de cet épisode de chaleur est encore incertaine. Mais, « il semble que celui-ci risque de se prolonger en début de semaine, au moins lundi, avant le déclenchement des orages ». Ce « pic de chaleur » risque également de « devenir une vague de chaleur » avec des moyennes de températures sur un plan national dépassant les 24 °C jusqu’à mercredi. « La durée précise dépendra de l’arrivée des orages, lesquels pourront alors faire baisser les températures », ajoute La Chaîne Météo.\nÀ partir de jeudi prochain., le temps pourrait devenir « nettement plus instable » avec « du vent et des averses qui pourraient s’installer pour le pont du 15 août ».",
