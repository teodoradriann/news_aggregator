    "text": "It’s been more than two months since the first of a series of deviating wildfires rocked Southern California, and the residents from those areas are still feeling its effects.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers spurred into action last month, and now Mookie Betts is doing his part to help the victims of the wildfires, donating $30,000 worth of shoes and other apparel through his 50/50 Foundation.\nThe mission of Betts’ foundation is focused on helping children excel in their pursuits by putting them in the best possible position to do so, both in and outside of sports.\nThey aim to accomplish that through the foundation’s commitment to building groundbreaking sports programs for underrepresented youth and a specific focus on providing resources in the realms of physical activity, nutrition, mental health, and financial literacy.\nBetts is the latest example of the entire Dodgers organization’s commitment to giving back to the community at a time where people need it the most. There have been countless examples over the months since the wildfires began, and current and former Dodgers players have each contributed to the recovery efforts.\nDodgers ownership has been at the forefront as well, raising money , donating resources, and even making a $100 million pledge to the LA Rises Initiative through owner Mark Walter and the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation.\nMookie Betts nominated for 2024 Roberto Clemente Award The work that Betts and his wife Brianna have accomplished since establishing the 5050 Foundation in 2021 resulted with his first nomination for the Roberto Clemente Award last season. Betts also orchestrates his ’50 Feeds LA’ program, with more than $300,000 in contributions to feed thousands of Angelenos in South L.A. over the past three holiday seasons.\nBetts’ work with UCLA Children’s Hospital, Brotherhood Crusade, Crete Academy, financial literacy workshops at local high schools, are just some of many instances where he has served the community.\nHave you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel ?

    "title": "Arsenal vs West Ham final score, result, highlights as boos ring out at Emirates after Hammers soundly beat Gunners",
    "text": "Mikel Arteta's Arsenal dropped three vital points in the title race as they were comfortably beaten 2-0 by West Ham United. It's a result that sees the Gunners remain in second place behind league-leaders Liverpool as they picked up three points at Turf Moor earlier in the week. The Irons took a somewhat controversial lead through Tomas Soucek after Jarrod Bowen picked him out in the box but it appeared that the ball may have crossed the byline. VAR took a lengthy look, like they did when a similar situation occurred during Arsenal's trip to Newcastle earlier in the season, but they decided to stay with the on-field decision. The main camera angle that VAR were looking at was in position behind Bowen's body and it was difficult to tell whether the entirety of the ball was out of play, due to it being hidden by the Englishman's body. West Ham went into the break a goal to the good and then doubled their lead shortly into the second half. James Ward-Prowse's corner found the former Gunner, Konstantinos Mavropanos, who powerfully met the ball with his head to beat David Raya. For David Moyes, he has put an end to a historically miserable record as he won his first Premier League away game against either Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool or Arsenal. Declan Rice then conceded a penalty in injury time to make matters worse for the £105 million signing, who had been jeered all night by his fellow fans. Said Benrahma stepped up to the spot but couldn't beat Raya with the last kick of the match. It's only the Gunners' third defeat of the season, their first at home and they find themselves two points behind Liverpool. Oh and don't forget about the reigning champions, who can go level on points if they win their game in hand. MORE: Premier League table in full FT: That's it! West Ham have done it. They've picked up two huge wins in the space of a week, after beating Man United at the weekend they've now come to the Emirates and ran over Arsenal. 95th minute: PENALTY SAVED! Raya makes a great save to deny Benrahma. 94th minute: Penalty to West Ham! It's Declan Rice who concedes it with a poor challenge in the box. 90th minute: There are five minutes added on. 84th minute: Arsenal really can't create anything clear-cut to find a way back. The Hammers are defending brilliantly. 76th minute: West Ham fans are sensing three points as they chant: \"Declan, what's the score? Declan, Declan what's the score?\" 73rd minute : The visiting side have managed to weather the storm well so far and their support are cheering every pass. Just a little over 15 minutes to go, can they hold onto the lead? 66th minute: A huge chance for the Gunners. This time it's White who clips a cross to the far post and Jesus can't keep his headed effort down. 62nd minute: It appears as though Arteta is preparing to make some substitutions. 56th minute: GOAL! WEST HAM DOUBLE THEIR LEAD! It's a fantastic corner from Ward-Prowse and Mavropanos rockets the header in. 50th minute: As expected, Arteta's side have come out of the interval on the front foot and you get the feeling this could be a long second half for the Hammers. 46th minute: The second half is underway! HT: That's all for the first half and West Ham lead after scoring with their only shot on target through Soucek. 45+4: Odegaard is brilliantly tackled by Ogbonna in the box to deny a potential goal-scoring opportunity. 45th minute: Six minutes of added time after the lengthy goal check and the Paqueta injury. 42nd minute: Saka off the post! West Ham lose the ball in a dangerous position and Arsenal look to capitalise but Saka's right-footed strike rockets off the near post. 37th minute: Arsenal create the chance well but Martinelli's effort is well wide. They need to start testing Areola. 31st minute: Paqueta picks up a knock and is substituted for Said Benrahma. 27th minute: Arsenal have a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left of the 18-yard box but they really mess it up and it's a waste of an opportunity. 20th minute: This stat via Opta isn't fun reading for Gunners fans: Arsenal have beaten West Ham 8 times in the Premier League having conceded the first goal, more than they have against any other opponent in the competition. 17th minute: After a lengthy VAR check to see if the ball remained in play before Bowen teed up Soucek, the goal stands! 13th minute: GOAL! 0-1 WEST HAM! Emerson's delivery is dealt with poorly by Zinchenko whose clearance is right into the path of Bowen and he knocks it back to Soucek who smashes past Raya. 10th minute: Slight chance for the Hammers as Ward-Prowse's free-kick finds Soucek but he can't redirect it goalwards and it goes out for a goal-kick. 4th minute: The Gunners have made a bright start and Martin Odegaard has just found Bukayo Saka with a neat backheel but the Englishman's shot was straight at Areola. 1st minute: We're underway at the Emirates! 15 minutes until kickoff: Nearly time for kickoff at the Emirates. Arsenal fans, you'll be glad to read that Spurs are 2-0 down at Brighton in the first half. 30 minutes until kickoff: Jarrod Bowen is making his 150th Premier League appearance this evening, can he mark it with a goal? 1 hour until kickoff: Team news is out! With Kai Havertz suspended this evening, Leandro Trossard comes in for the Gunners. Angelo Ogbonna starts as the skipper for the visitors. 1 hour 30 mins until kickoff: Bukayo Saka has been involved in 18 goals in his last 17 home games in all competitions, with 11 of those finding the back of the net and assisting seven. There's no place like home... 2 hours until kickoff: At least Declan Rice is playing with Bukayo Saka now! Arsenal will miss the improving Kai Havertz due to a suspension for yellow card accumulation, after picking up his fifth booking of the season against Liverpool last time out. A groin injury for Fabio Vieira means it will likely be Leandro Trossard who steps in for the absent German. Thomas Partey has returned to training and could be brought back into the fold in this match, needing a few substitute appearances before he's ready to start. Takehiro Tomiyasu remains out with a calf injury, and Jurrien Timber is a long-term absentee thanks to his serious knee injury. Arsenal starting lineup (4-3-3): Raya (GK) — White, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko — Odegaard, Rice, Trossard — Saka, Jesus, Martinelli. Arsenal subs (12): To be confirmed Only the knee injury to Michail Antonio is a concern for David Moyes, who otherwise has his full contingent of West Ham players at his disposal. Antonio was injured on international duty with Jamaica back in November, and is \"improving and getting closer\" according to Moyes, but is unlikely to be ready for action just yet. West Ham projected starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Areola (GK) — Coufal, Mavropanos, Ogbonna, Emerson — Soucek, E. Alvarez — Kudus, Ward-Prowse, Paqueta — Bowen. West Ham subs (12): To be confirmed USA: Arsenal vs. West Ham from the Emirates Stadium will be televised in the United States exclusively on NBC's premium streaming service Peacock. UK: Thursday's match will be shown in the UK exclusively on Amazon Prime . Canada: Premier League matches can be seen in Canada all season long on Fubo , the nation's leading streaming service for world-class soccer. Australia: Australia's sole broadcaster for the Premier League is Optus Sport, who recently signed a new deal to telecast the product Down Under for the next six seasons until 2028 .",

Coal supplies the lion's share of humanity's energy, at around 35%, and gas sits in second place at maybe 23%. Next place goes to the first \"clean\" source, hydropower, at about 15% – but that does require a lot of dirty concrete, and it's also reliant on geography, so it's not really a growth area. Nuclear is next, but that's contributing about 9% and dropping. It doesn't produce carbon emissions, and statistically it's the safest power source of them all, but carries an unfortunate stigma due to occasional high-profile accidents like the ones at Chernobyl and Fukushima. Rising sharply are wind and solar power, at 7.3% and 4.5% respectively, and these two form the future backbone of most countries' current decarbonization strategies, in combination with energy storage technologies that can smooth out the annoying offsets between supply and demand. \"Other renewables,\" including geothermal, wave and tidal energy, have barely left the starter's blocks, contributing just 0.34% of global energy. So there's the challenge ahead: create massive amounts of new clean energy generation capacity, enough to replace the coal and gas that power most of the planet, enough to outpace mankind's growing appetite for energy, and enough to cover things like the entire transport sector and other fossil-burning industries that will also be moving to electric power as they clean their acts up. Solar Power We haven't really seen a particularly exciting year in new solar technologies. The record for photovoltaic cell efficiency has probably crept upward in some laboratory somewhere, but cost-competitive commercial solar is about as efficient as it's been for the last few years, and the sector seems to be chugging along fairly nicely. Arizona has resurrected an idea first trialed in India to [place solar cells over canals](https://newatlas.com/energy/solar-canals-arizona/), cooling the water and hoping to prevent it from evaporating it away in the desert heat. A group of middle-eastern researchers have revisited the idea of giant solar updraft towers, adding a ring of cooling downdraft towers around them to create a [double-action clean energy tower that'll generate power 24/7/365](https://newatlas.com/energy/double-solar-updraft-cooling/), provided you build them in deserts and supply them with water for the cooling downdraft towers. And on the more out-there end of the scale, [Caltech's Space Solar Power Project team has successfully beamed energy down](https://newatlas.com/energy/space-solar-power-transmission-test-caltech/) from space and received it on Earth. Buoyed by a hundred million dollars in private funding, this team is working fast to advance its audacious plan to launch a massive 3.5-square-mile (9-sq-km) self-assembling solar array into space, where it'll harvest up to eight times as much energy as panels on Earth can, with no night time to slow it down, and beam that energy down to the surface 24/7. Wind Power There's been a lot of innovative ideas in the wind energy space, a lot of them focused offshore. Most of the world's best wind resources are located over deep water, where it's not practical to build great big fan-on-a-stick turbines that work well in shallow water or on land. So there have been several floating wind ideas fighting to establish themselves as the most technically and economically feasible ways to go grab that power. One of the most radical and fascinating ideas we've been following is [World Wide Wind's contra-rotating vertical-axis wind turbines](https://newatlas.com/energy/coaxial-vertical-floating-wind-turbines/). These promise to generate more power, at less cost, than a fan-on-a-stick, while also being massively more scalable and deployable in deep water. The company announced significant progress in November, [deploying a 19-meter prototype in Norway](https://newatlas.com/energy/floating-contra-rotating-vawt-offshore/). [Another prototype hit the water for T-Omega](https://newatlas.com/energy/t-omega-floating-wind-prototype/), which has created a no-nonsense design more like a ferris wheel, complete with a floating pyramid base. The idea here is bargain-basement cost of manufacture, deployment and maintenance, which the company achieves by eliminating a lot of the stresses on the upper generator by holding it from both ends, among other things. With small-scale wave tank testing complete, the company has now deployed a 1/16th scale prototype near New Bedford, Massachusetts. And we were fascinated by [Touchwind's very strange single-bladed turbine](https://newatlas.com/energy/touchwind-floating-wind-turbine/), which was going into testing with a 6-m prototype in the Netherlands. This odd duck tilts over to harvest more power from slow winds, but helicopters itself upright to reduce its exposure to wind in a storm scenario. Touchwind says this machine will generate more power than standard designs at half the cost. Meanwhile, in the fan-on-a-stick world of current technology, bigger is always better – and [Mingyang Smart Energy announced it's building a goliath of an offshore turbine, a 22-megawatt monster](https://newatlas.com/energy/mingyang-22mw-massive-turbine/) with a rotor diameter over 310 m (1,017 ft), standing taller than the Eiffel Tower. It'll be one of the largest machines the world has ever seen. Moving back onshore, we were interested to learn about Wyoming company Airloom Energy, which has prototyped a [very odd-looking system that places vertical wing-blades on an oval-shaped track](https://newatlas.com/energy/airloom-energy-wind-track/), creating wind turbines that are a third the cost of regular towers and much closer to the ground. With the backing of Bill Gates and Breakthrough Energy, Airloom is working on a 50-kW prototype. And finally, if you're going to build a fan on a stick, at least now you can do it without the massive cranes that have typically been needed. [Lagerway and KoalaLifter have created some very neat climbing cranes](https://newatlas.com/energy/koalalifter-climbing-crane/), which literally shimmy up the tower as it's built, using whatever's there as their base to lift the next bits up. A simple idea, perhaps, but very cool to watch in execution. Geothermal energy All of humanity's energy woes would disappear overnight if we could just tap into the massive source of heat energy under the Earth's crust wherever we wanted to – so there's plenty of activity in a rejuvenated geothermal industry that's looking to vastly expand its capabilities and impact. The banner achievement of 2023 has been from [Fervo, which teamed up with Google](https://newatlas.com/energy/google-fervo-geothermal/) to develop and build an [advanced geothermal plant](https://newatlas.com/energy/fervo-geothermal-test/) in Nevada using a technique similar to fracking from the oil and gas industry. Fervo uses fluid pressure to crack subterranean hot rock, broadening the surface area it can harvest heat from. This makes geothermal accessible and cost-competitive in a much broader range of areas, and could be used to extend and supercharge existing geothermal plants. Sage Geosystems took things a step further, pioneering [a new type of energy storage that uses the Earth below it as a giant bellows](https://newatlas.com/energy/sage-geosystems-huff-puff/). Water is pumped down into fractures in hot rock using renewable energy, pressurizing them enough to push them open. When energy is required, valves are opened and the weight of the Earth squeezes the water back up – but now, it's geothermally heated. Sage says this \"huff & puff\" method effectively gives you a subterranean battery that returns twice as much energy as you put into it. Drilling technology is advancing quickly, too. [Slovakia's GA Drilling showed off a new \"walking\" Anchorbit, as well as a Plasmabit zero-contact drilling system](https://newatlas.com/energy/ga-drilling-deep-geothermal/) that can bore holes through rock as deep as 10 km (6.2 miles) underground. That's a fair bit deeper than most drill systems can do with any sort of speed and affordability, and it makes rock temperatures over 350 °C (662 °F) accessible to most of the planet. One company we've been disappointed not to hear more from this year, though, is [Quaise](https://newatlas.com/energy/quaise-deep-geothermal-millimeter-wave-drill/) – the mob that's working on [using hijacked gyrotrons from the fusion industry to drill the deepest holes in history](https://newatlas.com/energy/quaise-deep-geothermal-drilling-questions/), as far down as 20 km (12.4 miles) underground. This would unlock temperatures around 500 °C (932 °F) nearly anywhere on the planet, so you could retrofit old coal-fired power plants within weeks into geothermal turbines using supercritically heated water, which would give you 10 times more power generation capacity than cooler temperature water. Quaise has been very quiet this year, but last year the company promised full-scale field demonstrations in 2024. So stay tuned! Nuclear fission and fusion power Advanced nuclear fission power had a landmark moment this year, with China claiming the commissioning of the [world's first commercial Generation-IV nuclear power station](https://newatlas.com/energy/china-brings-worlds-first-generation-iv-nuclear-reactor-online/). The Shidao Bay plant uses a high-temperature gas-cooled pebble-bed reactor. But for futurists, much of the juice was in a nuclear fusion sector that's been re-energized in recent years thanks to a number of commercial operations, each of which claims it's got enough nimble startup mojo and technological advances up its sleeve to leapfrog what major governments and international projects have been working on for decades. California company TAE, for example, made the [world's first readings of magnetically confined hydrogen-boron fusion](https://newatlas.com/energy/tae-first-hydrogen-boron-fusion/) back in February, proving the potential of a fusion approach that doesn't require tritium – a key fuel proposed for other reactors, but one that's in very short supply and incredibly difficult to create. On the other hand, H-B fusion needs much, much hotter plasma temperatures – [TAE is shooting for around a billion degrees](https://newatlas.com/energy/tae-fusion-interview/) or more by the early 2030s, when it says it'll have the world's first fusion plant connected to the grid. Mind you, OpenAI's Sam Altman is betting his company Helion will get there considerably faster. [Helion signed a deal in May to provide Microsoft with at least 50 MW of clean fusion power by 2028, or else pay financial penalties](https://newatlas.com/energy/helion-microsoft-fusion-2028/). This outrageously audacious move assumes Helion's unique reactor tech (which claims to generate electricity at less than a third the price of coal) will develop at crazy pace. We're pressing X to doubt on this one for the time being. In other news, the [world's largest tokamak reactor fired up](https://newatlas.com/energy/worlds-largest-tokamak-fusion-reactor-powers-up/) earlier this month in Japan, and the UK's [Tokamak Energy unveiled a commercial fusion plant design](https://newatlas.com/energy/commercial-fusion-power-plant-attractive-alternative-fossil-fuels/) it says should be ready for the early 2030s. There's plenty more to talk about – particularly in the [grid-level energy storage](https://newatlas.com/tag/grid-level-energy-storage/) field, in which companies are popping up all over the place with fascinating ways to store and release excess renewable energy at the lowest possible cost. But you're probably ready for a Christmas brandy at this point, so we'll detain you no further! Suffice to say, there have been plenty of interesting new and resurrected ideas in the clean energy space in 2023, and we expect things to continue to ramp up in 2024 as humanity strives to steer this ocean liner of a climate away from a fast-looming iceberg. See you there!",

    "title": "Problems still plaguing Butte parking garage",
    "text": "Butte-Silver Bow has hired a private security company on an emergency basis to patrol the Uptown parking garage, saying drinking, fighting and other dangerous activities among mostly juveniles demand immediate action. The problems aren’t new and nothing horrific has happened yet, said county Chief Executive J.P. Gallagher, but the illicit behavior has become so frequent and dangerous of late that security patrols at night are needed. Gallagher asked commissioners for emergency spending authority to hire Timberline Security for at least the next two weeks at the garage, located at 60 W. Park St. The council suspended its rules to consider the request on such short notice Wednesday night then OK’d the arrangement. “We’re having an incredible amount of activity, especially with the summer activities, with young people up there drinking, fighting, walking on the rails, and we’re getting it reported by people who live nearby,” Gallagher told The Montana Standard on Thursday. People are also reading… Vehicle gates at each entrance to the garage are lowered each night at 10 p.m. but that hasn’t stopped the activities, much of them occurring on the open-air top story. “There’s just a lot of really dangerous activity that’s been happening throughout the night,” Gallagher said. “Police have been responding, but by the time they pull up, the people disperse. “We are finding an incredible amount of bottles and glass and we clean it up every single day, but it’s turned into a dangerous situation and we think this is the best preventative measure that makes sense,” he said. Under a contract, Timberline will have a security guard patrolling the garage from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. every night through at least Aug. 20. Timberline will be paid $33.25 per hour the first week and $29.50 per hour the second week. The total is $3,074.75 for the two weeks. The contract can be extended after that with council approval and Gallagher says he might ask for that. But he hopes a private company can deliver longer-term solutions to parking problems in the garage and elsewhere. Commissioners recently considered a proposal for that but put it on hold when questions arose about proper bidding procedures. They could choose among new proposals soon. County officials committed to building a parking garage as part of a deal that resulted in NorthWestern Energy building a new $25 million Montana headquarters Uptown. The county’s Urban Revitalization Agency used taxpayer dollars to finance construction of the $7.4 million parking garage on West Park Street and it was completed in 2018. Many of NorthWestern’s employees paid for monthly parking permits. But the kiosk system for hourly parkers hasn’t worked well, use of the garage dropped significantly during the COVID pandemic and never rebounded, and other problems have plagued the facility the past few years. They include vagrancy, human feces and urine found in the building, discarded needles and trash, and teens using it as a party place. The county has responded with more patrols by police and parking officers, increased power washes and cleanings and other moves, but some of the problems have persisted. Gallagher still thinks the problems are fixable. “Until that point, we’re probably going to need security in there, especially at night,” he said.",
