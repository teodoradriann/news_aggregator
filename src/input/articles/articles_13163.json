    "text": "中天新聞網 租金補貼要分攤！盧秀燕嘆無力倒貼 劉世芳：今年不影響 閱讀全文\n倪鴻祥 2025年6月18日 下午8:30 內政部國土署日前函文通知地方縣市政府，指明年推動「300億元中央擴大租金補貼專案計畫」，是因應《財政收支劃分法》修正，要求地方政府自籌10%至40%不等的經費，引發反彈。台中市長盧秀燕坦言「沒有能力倒貼或幫忙出」。對此，內政部長 劉世芳 今（19日）受訪時重申，今（2025）年度的租金補貼不受影響。\n內政部長劉世芳。（圖／中天新聞）\n立法院內政委員會上午審查《住宅法》部分條文修正草案，安排內政部長劉世芳列席說明並備質詢，她在會前接受媒體聯訪時，針對租金補貼要求地方政府分攤一事再度澄清。\n劉世芳強調，現在所謂的租金補助是屬於「非法定」的一般性補助款，跟所謂一般性補助款刪掉25%是不一樣的，因此今年度的租金補貼，完全沒有受到任何影響。\n她說，目前6都政府中已有5都收到國土署的函文，因此該署函文內容其實是回應5都的公務人員，確認明年的預算是否要編列此科目，並請地方按照以往如果有分擔的部分，放到明年的預算編列裡面。\n對於中央要求租金補貼政策要地方政府分攤，台北市長蔣萬安怒批，中央前後矛盾、邏輯錯亂，「話都你在講，刀都你在砍，卻都砍向辛苦的老百姓」（行政院針對財劃法修正案聲請釋憲，卻又據財劃法修正案為理由要地方分攤租金補貼）。\n台中市長盧秀燕也強調，台中還在籌措被中央刪減的32億元補助款，所以「沒有能力倒貼或幫忙出」，她並代租戶向中央請命，要求對全國民眾的租金補貼業務一定要穩定，「不要一下有一下沒有，這樣不好」。\n內政部國土署署長吳欣修表示，租金補貼本來就屬於地方自治事項，且受到立法院三讀通過「財政收支劃分法修正案」衝擊，將增加釋出3753億元給地方，中央補助財源受到排擠，明年度租金補貼將回到2021年以前，中央、地方各自負擔相對比率經費的模式。\n延伸閱讀",

    "text": "Tennessee Names First English-Language Bible Translation in US as Official State Book The legislation received strong support from Republicans in the Tennessee House and Senate, who hold strong supermajorities in both chambers. The first English-language translation of the Bible in the United States will become an “official state book” in Tennessee on July 1. Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, [signed a bill](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/HB1828/2023) on Tuesday that names the Aitken Bible and nine other texts as official state books in the Tennessee Blue Book (an official manual on the state government). This is the first time Tennessee has formally recognized any official state books. The Bible translation was published by Philadelphia printer Robert Aitken in 1782 and received an official endorsement from Congress. The American Revolution, which began in 1776, halted trade with Great Britain and cut off the supply of Bibles, which prompted Aitken to publish an English-language Bible in the country, according to the legislation. Aitken’s translation received its [official endorsement](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Journals_of_the_American_Congress_from_1/sEQUAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22That+the+United+States+in+Congress+assembled,+highly+approve+the+pious+and+laudable+undertaking+of+Mr.+Aitken,+as+subservient+to+the+interest+of+religion+as+well+as+an+instance+of+the+progress+of+the+arts+in+this+country,+and+being+satisfied+from+the+above+report,+of+his+care+and+accuracy+in+the+execution+of+the+work+they+recommend+this+edition+of+the+Bible+to+the+inhabitants+of+the+United+States+and+hereby+authorize+him+to+publish+this+recommendation+in+the+manner+he+shall+think+proper%22&pg=PA76&printsec=frontcover) from the Congress of the Confederation in 1782, which was the American legislative body that preceded the establishment of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The 18th-century resolution states that the lawmakers “highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as subservient to the interest of religion, as well as the interest of the progress of arts in this country.” It further states that the lawmakers “recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of the United States.” The translation, which is a version of the Protestant King James Version of the Bible, is not approved by the Vatican for Catholics. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops lists approved translations of the Bible [on its website](https://www.usccb.org/offices/new-american-bible/approved-translations-bible). Tennessee’s legislation that names the Aitken Bible as an official state book notes that the state is home to “the largest publisher of authentic reproductions of the Aitken Bible,” which is the Aitken Bible Historical Foundation. It adds that Tennessee is home to “three of the five privately owned original first American Bibles remaining in the world today.” The legislation received strong support from Republicans in the Tennessee House and Senate, who hold strong supermajorities in both chambers. The bill faced opposition from most Democrats but received one Democratic vote in the House. Some of the other historic books designated as official state books in this legislation included President George Washington’s “Farewell Address” and “Democracy in America” by Alexis de Tocqueville. The bill also recognized the 1977 book “Roots” by Alex Haley, which discusses slavery in the United States, and the 2016 book “Coat of Many Colors” by the Tennessee-born country singer Dolly Parton. Tennessee lawmakers also [passed a bill](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/HB2125/id/2907729) that would recognize November as “Christian Heritage Month.” The legislation was sent to Lee, but the governor has not yet taken any action on it.",

    "title": "These 4 Altcoins Are Catching Eyes: BlockDAG's 2,380% Jump, XRP's Stability, BNB's Growth & Toncoin's Big Bet",
    "text": "Crypto markets are back in motion, helped along by increased interest from institutions and fresh liquidity from everyday traders. As the environment turns more optimistic, some altcoins are starting to break away from the noise—driven by real use cases and steady development.\nRight now, BlockDAG, XRP, Binance Coin, and Toncoin are building their own momentum. Some are gaining from early-stage traction, others from long-standing influence. But together, they’re all part of the conversation around the best crypto to buy now.\nBlockDAG has put itself on the map with a different approach. It uses a hybrid model, mixing Proof-of-Work and DAG technology to let multiple miners handle transactions at once. That setup helps speed things up and keeps network fees low.\nWhat caught the community’s attention recently was its Keynote 3 on March 28. This update wasn’t just a standard project briefing—it gave a clear view of what’s been done, what’s coming, and how the entire setup works. Features like the BlockDAG Academy were also introduced, providing even more clarity to users and developers.\nSince the presale kicked off, BlockDAG has raised more than $210 million and sold over 19 billion coins. Its token price moved from $0.001 to $0.0248, marking a massive 2,380% jump from its starting point. That alone is enough to make people pay attention.\nBig steps are still ahead, including the Token Generation Event, a mainnet rollout, and listings on major exchanges. With those milestones on the horizon, BlockDAG’s current position makes it one of the best crypto options to watch right now—especially for those looking for projects with proven demand and a strong technical foundation.\nXRP isn’t just a name from past bull runs. Its core use—speeding up cross-border payments—still gives it value. Developed by Ripple Labs, it lets users convert between currencies at a lower cost and faster pace than most traditional platforms.\nRight now, XRP is hovering around $2.26. Some market watchers think it could reach $3, while others are pointing toward a dip to $1.07 if pressure builds. Its use in the payments world helps keep it relevant, even when markets cool off. For anyone trying to weigh up the best crypto to buy now, XRP still brings solid use and familiarity.\nBNB began as a way to cut fees on Binance’s exchange but has since grown into something far bigger. People now use it for everything from travel bookings to retail payments, and it’s become a key part of Binance’s overall platform.\nBNB is currently trading at roughly $630.79. Some forecasts suggest it could go over $1,000 within a year. The demand stays steady, partly because BNB plays a central role in Binance’s regular operations. If you’re comparing long-term hold options, this one still earns a spot in conversations about the best crypto to buy now.\nToncoin’s roots go back to Telegram, and its goal is to make digital transactions quicker and more convenient. It powers The Open Network and helps users send and receive funds without friction.\nTrading at around $3.96, Toncoin has recently seen a boost in trading volume, passing $384 million over a 24-hour span. A $400 million fundraising round also added fuel to the fire. Some believe Toncoin could rise another 60% as adoption grows. For those scanning the market for new ideas, TON brings a mix of big backing and fresh energy.\nEach of these altcoins has its own angle. XRP continues to serve cross-border transactions. Binance Coin powers a giant exchange and its services. Toncoin benefits from being connected to one of the world’s largest messaging apps.\nBut BlockDAG brings something that stands out—a proven 2,380% gain, over $210 million in presale raised, and new features backed by a clearly explained roadmap. With its Keynote 3 release laying out the path ahead and a rising number of users already involved, BDAG may be the best crypto to buy now based on current potential and growth alone.\nJoin our WhatsApp Channel to get the latest news, exclusives and videos on WhatsApp\n________",

    "title": "During coldest days, Nashville provides shelter, warmth to those without a home",
    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — As the cold front moves in, Nashville is working to make sure everyone in the city stays warm. The Office of Emergency Management are conducting cold patrols Sunday to Tuesday. They drive across Nashville, giving out blankets and pointing those without a home to the nearest shelter. The team starts this once temperatures hit 22 degrees or lower. \"It feels really good to get people indoors to the shelters and know they're going to have a safe place to sleep when the weather turns,\" said Matt Cerone, who supervises operations in the field. \"If it's gonna be [close to] zero tonight, that means it's going to get bad,\" said Joe Anderson, who received a blanket Sunday. \"With hypothermia...a lot of times you don't make it.\" Those needing a warm place to stay have a few options. Metro Social Services will open an \"Extreme Cold Weather Overflow Shelter\" at 32-30 Brick Church Pike. It's opening Sunday at 7p.m. and will stay open through Tuesday morning at 10. You can get free transportation through the WeGo shuttle service from the downtown bus station on Charlotte Avenue. Couples and pets are welcome, but those needing shelter should first head to the Nashville Rescue Mission and Room in the Inn. We are under a [Storm 5 alert](https://www.newschannel5.com/weather/dangerously-cold-temperatures-and-accumulating-snow-likely-1-14-24) until Wednesday morning for cold temperatures and snow accumulation. Watch the forecast below.",

    "text": "Christmas came a couple of days late for newly released Gypsy Rose Blanchard – but she still managed to celebrate with family and friends. Her dad Rod and stepmother Kristy were both on hand at a secret Kansas City safehouse on Thursday evening, less than 24 hours after her release from a Missouri prison, DailyMail.com can reveal. Munchausen by proxy victim Gypsy was freed from custody Thursday morning after serving seven years for the murder of her abusive mom Clauddine 'Dee Dee' Blanchard in 2015. Her post-incarceration life kicked off with a night in a budget hotel with husband Ryan Anderson, followed by a trip to Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse - where she posed for DailyMail.com in new sneakers and giggled: 'I love them.' Exclusive DailyMail.com photos show Gypsy Rose's father Rod Blanchard taking out boxes and gift wrapping paper from the garage on Thursday after a belated Christmas celebration at a Kansas City rental home Rod and his wife Kristy reunited with Gypsy for the first time since she was released from prison on Thursday after serving a seven-year sentence Gypsy Rose Blanchard has set up an Instagram account and posted her first post-prison selfie Gypsy's to do list includes a book launch, docuseries and snagging tickets to Sunday's Kansas City Chiefs game where she's hoping for an improbable meet-up with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce . But before that she enjoyed an emotional Christmas reunion Thursday night with her dad and stepmom Rod and Kristy Blanchard at the rented Kansas City home where she's staying with teacher Ryan, 36. A handful of close friends arrived bearing gifts for their newly released gal pal while a TV production crew filmed Gypsy's every move. Rod and his wife Kristy left the house early Friday morning, believed to be on their way back home to Louisiana. Kristy said last week how much Gypsy was looking forward to Christmas surrounded by family – even if Santa would have to wait an additional three days to pay her a visit. 'We're going to do Christmas. I've got a Christmas tree, I've got her so many gifts. I went overboard, actually,' Kristy told NewsNation. 'Oh, we're also doing a spa day … we're going to go get her pedicure, manicure, facial, haircut, colored if she wants, you know, the works, bring her shopping. She can't wait.' The family gathered for an emotional Christmas reunion Thursday night at the rented Kansas City home where she's staying with teacher-husband Ryan, 36 Rod and his wife Kristy left the house early Friday morning, believed to be on their way back home to Louisiana – but not before clearing away the wrapping paper and packaging In interviews last week, relatives described how much Gypsy had been looking forward to Christmas surrounded by family Gypsy (pictured right as a child with her father) is seen left in a prison photo with dad Rod and stepmom Kristy Blanchard On Friday Gypsy celebrated her freedom by taking to Instagram to post her first post-prison selfie . The 32-year-old shared a mirror picture of herself smiling in a blue and white faded sweater and jeans with the caption 'First selfie of freedom!' In the first hour of the image being posted Blanchard gathered more than 160,000 likes and thousands of messages of support. Blanchard spent her first day of freedom shopping for shoes, buying two pairs of sneakers at a nearby mall. She was spotted leaving a Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott in Chillicothe, Missouri , on Thursday – where she had crashed overnight shortly after walking free from prison almost 12 hours earlier. Wearing a distressed sweatshirt, jeans, and only socks on her feet, the ex-con was helped by her husband as she carried her belongings – including two plastic grocery bags full of snacks – to their silver Cadillac sedan, DailyMail.com photos show. They then drove to a local mall where she bought two pairs of sneakers. A handful of close friends arrived bearing gifts for their newly released gal pal while a TV production crew filmed Gypsy's every move Guests arrive to visit at the secret safehouse to visit Gypsy Rose following her release The couple left the $150-a-night hotel around 11.15am in a convoy of cars including producers and a camera crew that have been following the abuse victim around for their Lifetime show. They had rigged up GoPro cameras inside the car to capture her reaction. Gypsy is expected to attend Sunday's Kansas City Chiefs game against the Cincinatti Bengals at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday for an improbable meet-up with Taylor Swift. Hours earlier on Thursday, Ryan Scott Anderson, the teacher she married behind bars last year, was seen pulling into the Chillicothe Correctional Center in northern Missouri, to pick his wife up at 3:20am. His Cadillac sedan, with a Bret 'the Hitman' Hart wrestling decal across the front license plate cover, emerged minutes later to whisk Gypsy away for her first night of freedom at the budget hotel. The 32-year-old felon spent her childhood posing as a wheelchair-bound invalid after Claudine 'Dee Dee' Blanchard shaved her daughter's head, pumped her full of drugs and convinced the world she was suffering from leukemia and muscular dystrophy. Gypsy Rose Blanchard's first stop on Thursday was at an Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse in Liberty, just outside Kansas City, to buy some new shoes after leaving prison in socks Gypsy was snapped in public for the first time since her release from prison after checking out of a Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott in Chillicothe where she spent her first night of freedom The two spent the remainder of the night at a hotel in Chillicothe, before checking out later that morning to head to Kansas City Their 'inseparable' bond ended when Gypsy burst free of her warped mom's control in 2015 by letting her besotted internet boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn creep into their Springfield, Missouri, home to stab 48-year-old Dee Dee to death. Gypsy was jailed for 10 years for the matricide but was granted early parole in September after friends and family begged authorities to take account of the cruel abuse and needless medical procedures she endured while being cynically paraded at charity events and fundraisers. The network's cameras have already been following her every move as Gypsy enjoys her first few days of freedom which will reportedly include a spa, shopping trip and a Kansas City Chiefs game on Sunday - where she's told TMZ she's hoping to bump into Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Fans can look forward to more snippets on social media profiles set up prior to her release including a TikTok page - already boasting 400,000-plus followers - which describes her as a 'public figure/Speaker' and links to her new eBook, Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom. Gypsy's media credits and prison interviews already include Dr Phil, Good Morning America and 20/20, while Hulu, Netflix and Lifetime have all aired TV dramas based on her ordeal. She took part in the 2017 HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, and has an upcoming three-part docuseries, The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, airing January 5 through 7 on Lifetime.",

    "title": "5 Great REITs To Buy In 2024 - Cousins Props (NYSE:CUZ), Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) - Benzinga",
    "text": "Loading... Loading... Investors looking ahead into 2024 will find real estate investment trusts (REITs) to be an attractive sector of the stock market to own. After two years of inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, the tide seems to have turned. The Fed has paused rate hikes for three consecutive meetings and is telling Wall Street to expect three rate cuts in 2024. Some on Wall Street are surmising there actually could be more than three cuts this year, yet REITs have rallied hard recently, taking the Fed at its word.\nWhile it's difficult to say for sure which of the approximate 200 REITs will have the highest total gain over a full year, there are certain measures to look for to assist investors in selecting high-quality REITs that should perform very well over the full year ahead. They are:\nA strong finish in the final two months of 2023 A still moderate price to funds from operations (P/FFO) ratio A dividend yield that's high enough to compete with fixed-income assets, yet low enough to reduce the risk of being a yield trap A payout ratio that still covers the dividend without the risk of a dividend cut Don't Miss: Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%. Take a look at five REITs that encompass most or all of the parameters cited above and could perform well for investors in 2024:\nHealthcare Realty Trust Inc. HR is a Nashville, Tennessee-based healthcare REIT with 697 properties covering 41 million square feet across 35 states. It was established in 1992 with 21 facilities and has evolved into a delivery model in which 72% of its properties are multitenant medical outpatient service buildings on the campus of hospitals or other types of healthcare facilities. Its third-quarter occupancy rate was 90%.\nIn 2022, Healthcare Realty merged with Healthcare Trust of America in an $18 billion deal and became Healthcare Realty Trust. The top locations of its properties include Dallas, Seattle and Houston.\nStart generating passive income through real estate Check out these featured investments from Benzinga's Real Estate Offerings Screener.\nAustin Cityfund Nada Residential Non-Accredited Real Estate Fund Min.

Sign up to get offers directly to your inbox!\nHealthcare Realty Trust has been a major seller of assets since June, disposing of $318 million worth of properties. On Oct. 5, it reaffirmed its 2023 dispositions guidance of $350 million to $450 million. The intent is to increase its portfolio exposure to higher-growth, multitenant, on-campus medical outpatient buildings, and the sales proceeds will be used to fund development obligations and to repay its floating-rate debt.\nOn Oct. 12, JP Morgan analyst Michael Mueller upgraded Healthcare Realty Trust from Neutral to Overweight and announced a $19 price target. Mueller noted that Healthcare Realty Trust should improve its relative valuation in future quarters because of recent gains in occupancy.\nOn Nov. 13, Wells Fargo analyst Connor Siversky maintained an Equal-Weight rating on Healthcare Realty, while lowering the price target from $17 to $16. On Nov. 6, Wedbush Securities analyst Richard Anderson reiterated his Outperform rating on Healthcare Realty and maintained a $17 price target.\nHealthcare Realty has a P/FFO ratio of 11.03, well below the average for REITs of between 15 and 18. Its annual dividend yield of 7.15% has a moderate payout ratio of 78%. Over the last two months of 2023, it performed well, with a total return of 22.23%. This is an improving healthcare REIT with occupancy gains and debt reduction that could perform well going forward. Healthcare Realty's recent closing price was $17.35.\nHost Hotels & Resorts Inc. HST is a Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel REIT with 77 hotels containing 42,000 rooms in large markets across the U.S. Host Hotels has been a member of the S&P 500 since 2007 and is the only hotel REIT in the index . Its hotel brands include Marriott, Hyatt, Four Seasons and Hilton.\nOn Dec. 15, Host Hotels & Resorts announced an 11% increase in its fourth-quarter dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend is payable on Jan. 16 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29.\nOn Jan. 2, Jefferies analyst David Katz maintained a Buy rating on Host Hotels and raised the price target from $21 to $24. That's a 23.5% potential upside from its most recent closing price of $19.42.\nOn Dec. 22, Wells Fargo analyst Dori Kesten maintained an Overweight rating on Host Hotels and raised the price target from $20 to $22.\nHost Hotels had a 17% increase in its revenue per available rooms (RevPAR) between 2017 and 2023, and like many other hotel REITs, it anticipates further RevPAR improvement in 2023. It's still quite undervalued with only a 10.21 P/FFO. The 4.06% dividend yield is slightly less than desirable, but with the recent quarterly dividend increase and only a 41% payout ratio, another dividend increase could be in the cards for 2024.\nHost Hotels has had a total gain of 28.66% since Nov. 1.\nBoston Properties Inc. BPX is a Boston-based office REIT with 190 properties with 53.5 million square feet concentrated in five large cities: Boston; Manhattan, New York; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; and Seattle. The firm calls itself \"the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.\" Boston Properties is a member of the S&P 500.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, Boston Properties had a 90.4% occupancy rate with a weighted average lease term (WALT) of 7.5 years. That compares favorably with several other office REITs. About 10% of its office properties are for life sciences, which means little risk of its employees working from home. Its top 20 tenants include Google, Microsoft Corp., Biogen Inc., Fannie Mae and Bank of America Corp.\nAnalysts have expressed favorable views recently. On Dec. 20, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb maintained a Neutral rating on Boston Properties but raised the price target from $60 to $77. On Jan. 2, Jefferies analyst Peter Abramowitz upgraded Boston Properties from Hold to Buy and raised the target price from $57 to $80. Boston Properties' most recent closing price was $72.10.\nThe office REIT subsector has been scorching hot over the past two months, and Boston Properties has been one of the main beneficiaries of that. It had a total gain of 32.82% over that period. With a P/FFO of 9.92, there is still room for plenty of price appreciation and the dividend yield of 5.44% has a 32.82% payout ratio.\nWith declining interest rates and many companies demanding a return to office work or at least hybrid hours, there is much to like about Boston Properties for 2024.\nCousins Properties Inc. CUZ is an Atlanta-based office REIT, founded in 1958, with a portfolio of 19.1 million square feet of Class A office towers located in high-growth Sun Belt markets.\nMost of Cousins' portfolio consists of newer office buildings, with an average construction year of 2004. Many of its buildings include upscale amenities like exercise facilities, meeting rooms, wellness centers and cafes. Because of this, it's able to command rents that are 24% higher than the Class A average in its core markets of Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; Phoenix; and Tampa, Florida. Its tenants are higher grade and well diversified by industry. Cousins' November occupancy rate of 91.1% was well above many of its office REIT peers.\nCousins' top 25 tenant portfolio includes Bank of America, Briggs & Stratton Corp., HD Supply, Deloitte and the American Cancer Society. The top 25 tenants have a weighted average lease term of seven years. Cousins also has one of the strongest balance sheets among the office REIT subsector.\nOn Dec. 18, JP Morgan analyst Anthony Paolone upgraded Cousins Properties from Neutral to Overweight and increased the price target from $26 to $27. Also that day, Truist Securities analyst Michael Lewis maintained a Buy rating on Cousins Properties and lowered the price target from $28 to $27.\nThere is much to like about Cousins Properties. It's still quite undervalued with a P/FFO of 9.43. The annual dividend yield of 5.18% is well covered with only a 49% forward payout ratio.\nCousins Properties' most recent closing price was $24.71. It had a total gain of 36.26% over the last two months, the best performance of this group.\nFour Corners Property Trust Inc. FCPT is a Mill Valley, California-based diversified REIT, with a focus on owning net-leased restaurants, medical and dental services, automotive services and other retail properties in the Sun Belt. It's been one of the fastest-growing REITs over the past few years.\nFour Corners was created in November 2015 with 418 restaurants spun out from Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI . As time has progressed, many of the Darden properties were sold, but Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants still make up about 51% of Four Corners' total rents.\nFour Corners is one of the most aggressively growing REITs through acquisitions, and its acquisition standards are very carefully planned. Over the past seven years, Four Corners has steadily acquired more diversified properties, and its portfolio includes 1,106 long-term leased properties with 148 brands across 47 states. Four Corners has a strong occupancy rate of 99.8% with a weighted annual lease term of eight years. Its main strategy is to secure properties in a cap rate range between 6% to 7%, but it often exceeds those numbers.\nOn Nov. 1, Four Corners reported its third-quarter operating results. FFO of $0.42 was in line with estimates but above its third-quarter 2022 FFO of $0.42. Revenue of $64.84 million beat the analysts' estimate of $64.69 million and was 15.77% above revenue of $56.01 million in the third quarter of 2022.\nOn Nov. 10, Four Corners announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.34 per share to $0.345 per share. It was the fifth dividend raise over the past five years. The new $1.38 annual dividend yields 5.39%.\nWhile most REITs were fairly inactive around the end of the year, between Dec. 27 and Dec. 29, Four Corners announced it was acquiring two Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen properties in Arizona and Illinois for $4.7 million and two Tire Discounters properties in Ohio and Kentucky for $1.7 million and $1.8 million. The Popeyes properties were in the final stages of construction and have triple-net leases with 20 years of term remaining. The Tire Discounter properties were sale-leaseback contracts.\nFour Corners Property Trust has increased its revenue for 13 consecutive quarters as it continues its massive acquisition spree. Although it has the highest payout ratio (85%) and P/FFO (15.76%) of the group, the ongoing acquisitions in safer, higher cap rate properties and high occupancy rates could make Four Corners a big winner among REITs in 2024.\nThe chart below sums up the various parameters of the REITs cited above:\nNAME SYMBOL P/FFO DIVIDEND YIELD PAYOUT RATIO GAIN OVER PAST TWO MONTHS Four Corners Property Trust FCPT 15.76 5.39% 85% 20.4% Healthcare Realty Trust Inc.

    "title": "Met Office forecasts snow and heavy rain after deadly Storm Gerrit - Wales Online",
    "text": "The last few days of 2023 will see strong winds, rain and even snow featuring in parts of the UK. An area of low pressure which pushes in from the west on Saturday will be the most dominant feature in the forecast leading up to the new year.\nThe challenging conditions brought by Storm Gerrit have now eased, but Friday will be blustery with showers, some heavy, with some central locations likely to see the brightest conditions. During the early hours of Saturday morning a potentially deep area of low pressure will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK.\nAs the system moves eastwards, the boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east will lead to a band of transient snow across some of the high ground of northern England and Scotland. It is possible this snow could fall to lower levels for a brief period of time across Scotland.\nThe flooded Somerset levels between Langport and Muchelney after heavy rain from Storm Gerrit. Langport, Somerset. 27 December 2023. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nNick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”\nThousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday.\nPower company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected.\nCUPAR, SCOTLAND - DECEMBER 28: Residents in the Kinloss Park area start to clear up following the affects of Storm Gerrit on December 28, 2023 in Cupar, Scotland. Almost 8,000 homes are still without power following yesterdays storm which brought blizzards and flooding to many parts Scotland. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”\nNational Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nA supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nResidents in the Kinloss Park area start to clear up following the affects of Storm Gerrit on December 28, 2023 (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.\nDamaged houses can be seen in Carbrook Village in the aftermath of a tornado (Photo by Ryan Jenkins/Getty Images) Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.\nMet Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\n ",
