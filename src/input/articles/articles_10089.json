    "text": "Gastgewerbe: Mehr als jeder dritte neue Angestellte bekommt mehr – Regeländerung sorgt für „spürbaren Einfluss“ bei Geringverdienern\nFür Millionen Menschen in Deutschland führt die Erhöhung des Mindestlohns zu mehr Geld. Einige Branchen und Beschäftigungsarten sind besonders betroffen. Ein Gewerkschafter sagt: „Skandalös“\nBerlin – Mehr als jeder achte neu angestellte Arbeitnehmer in Deutschland wird profitieren. Der Mindestlohn wird angehoben. Das hatte die Mindestlohn-Kommission im Juni beschlossen. Am 1. Januar 2026 sind 13,90 Euro pro Stunde verpflichtend. 8,42 Prozent mehr für Geringverdiener. Das Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB) hat diese Woche eine Studie dazu veröffentlicht. Ein Fazit: 13 Prozent der Neuanstelllungen sind betroffen. Einige Jobs lohnen sich jetzt mehr.\nMehr neue Mitarbeiter betroffen als bereits angestellte Kollegen\nLaut den Studienautoren entsteht ein besonderer Unterschied zu bereits bestehenden Arbeitsverhältnissen: Hier sind lediglich fünf Prozent der Beschäftigten für weniger als 13,90 pro Stunde beschäftigt.\nDie Land- und Forstwirtschaft kann sich besonders freuen: Hier werden 53,2 Prozent der neuen Mitarbeiter profitieren. Wobei hauptsächlich die Landwirtschaft gemeint sein dürfte – hier arbeiten viele Saisonarbeiter aus dem Ausland. In der Vergangenheit gab es Diskussionen darum, ob der neue Mindestlohn auch in der Landwirtschaft gelten sollte. Eine Ausnahme ist aber rechtlich nicht möglich, wie eine Prüfung des Bundesagrarministeriums ergeben hat.\nGewerkschafter findet Zahlung von Mindestlöhnen „skandalös“\nDas Gastgewerbe ist mit 35,3 Prozent bei allen Neueinstellungen betroffen. Das schließt etwa Hotels und Restaurants und Bars ein. Hier profitieren also besonders viele Menschen vom neuen Mindestlohn. Die zuständige Gewerkschaft NGG findet es jedoch „skandalös“, dass das Gastgewerbe nach wie vor eine „Mindestlohnbranche“ sei.\nMark Baumeister von der zuständigen Gewerkschaft NGG sagte: „Den Preis dafür zahlen wir alle: durch Aufstockung der nicht ausreichenden Einkommen jetzt und später bei der Rente.“ Das Gastgewerbe müsse aus dem Niedriglohnbereich raus. Er fordert vom Tarifpartner DEHOGA, dieser müsse „unbedingt“ die Klauseln abschaffen, die es Arbeitgebern ermöglichten, die Tarifverträge in einigen Bundesländern „zum Schaden der Beschäftigten zu unterlaufen“.\nDie Botschaft: Mehr Tariflöhne bedeuten weniger Abhängigkeit vom Mindestlohn. Zuletzt hatte das Bundeskabinett beschlossen, die Tarifbindung bei eigenen Aufträgen zu stärken. DEHOGA-Präsident Guido Zöllick sprach in Bezug auf den Mindestlohn von „massiven Auswirkungen der Erhöhung auf die Betriebe seiner Branche“. Für die Hotellerie und Gastronomie bedeuteten diese „deutlichen Personalkostensteigerungen“ große Herausforderungen, wie er dem Portal Tageskarte berichtete.\nAbgesehen vom Gastgewerbe hat das IAB auch die Zahlen mitgeliefert, wie viele Menschen in Jobs insgesamt betroffen sein werden: Die Mindestlohnerhöhung betrifft demnach 10 Prozent aller bestehenden und neu begonnenen Jobs. Stefan Körzell, Vorstandsmitglied beim Deutschen-Gewerkschafts-Bund (DGB), sagt dazu: „Die Zahlen zeigen, wie groß der Niedriglohnsektor in Deutschland nach wie vor ist. Hier muss mit aller Kraft gegengesteuert werden – für gute Löhne und gute Arbeitsbedingungen.“\nNeben einem steigenden Mindestlohn brauche es laut Körzell eine flächendeckende Tarifbindung – „Unternehmen dürfen sich nicht länger aus der Verantwortung stehlen und müssen Tarifverträge akzeptieren“, sagte er dieser Zeitung. Das neue Tariftreuegesetz der Bundesregierung sei ein erster guter Schritt. „Weitere müssen folgen.“\nMindestlohn soll erhöht werden – Minijobs werden attraktiver\nInsbesondere Minijobs werden attraktiver. Die Erhöhung des Mindestlohns auf 13,90 Euro „würde hochgerechnet etwa 39 Prozent der Minijobs betreffen“, schreiben die Autoren. Nicole Gürtzgen spricht von einem „spürbaren Einfluss“ auf die Entlohnung im Niedriglohnbereich. Sie ist Leiterin des Forschungsbereichs Arbeitsmarktprozesse und Institutionen am IAB. Aber: auch hier Kritik von der Gewerkschaft. Dass vor allem Menschen in Minijobs von Niedriglöhnen betroffen sind, zeige, dass „Minijobs strenger reguliert“ und in „sozialversicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung umgewandelt“ werden müssten, sagte Körzell vom DGB.\nÜbrigens: Einige Menschen profitieren weder vom alten noch vom neuen Mindestlohn. Jugendliche unter 18 Jahren ohne abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung sind vom Mindestlohn ausgenommen, genauso wie manche Praktikanten, Menschen mit Behinderungen, die in Werkstätten arbeiten sowie Langzeitarbeitslose in den ersten sechs Monaten, wenn sie einen neuen Job aufnehmen. Auch Insassen in Gefängnissen sind betroffen.",

    "text": "Alexandria, Va., April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a significant victory for patients and community pharmacies in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed HB 1150 into law today. This is groundbreaking legislation that prohibits state permits to pharmacies owned by pharmacy benefit managers effective Jan. 1, 2026. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents the country’s independent pharmacies, supported the Arkansas Pharmacists Association’s leadership on HB 1150 as it moved through the legislative process.\nAPA is the voice of Arkansas pharmacists and has worked hard to advance HB 1150 and other PBM reform efforts. NCPA, which represents the country’s independent community pharmacies, has also persistently advocated that state and federal policymakers rein in the conflicts of interest and anticompetitive business practices that arise with PBMs vertically integrated upstream with health insurers and downstream with pharmacies. These practices include contract terms that restrict competitors’ access to patients, massive clawbacks, steering patients away from competing community pharmacies, below-cost reimbursements, and punitive audit practices. Prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies via HB 1150 would put an end to these tactics and promote Arkansans’ access to quality pharmacy care.\n“Today is a new day in Arkansas for our patients as the fox will no longer guard the henhouse,” said John Vinson, APA’s chief executive officer. “This bipartisan legislation passed overwhelmingly to protect public health and safety for Arkansans. HB 1150 will stop the abusive self-dealing at PBM affiliated pharmacies that raises prescription drug prices and limits patient access. The pharmacists of Arkansas are very grateful for a courageous legislature and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. We also thank Attorney General Tim Griffin for his support.”\n“Time and time again, PBMs have proven themselves to be resistant to transparency and reform,” said Anne Cassity, NCPA’s senior vice president of government affairs. “HB 1150 is a structural change that gets to the heart of the problem – the conflicts of interest inherent in vertical integration that PBMs have been manipulating to the detriment of patients, taxpayers, and pharmacies. We applaud HB 1150 and are eager to see its provisions implemented in Arkansas and, ideally, throughout the country.\"\nSince the introduction of HB 1150, similar ownership provisions were introduced or amended into bills in Indiana, New York, Texas, and Vermont. Additionally, on April 14, a bipartisan coalition of 39 state and territory attorneys general sent a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass legislation prohibiting PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. A bill to do so was introduced late last year by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Reps. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) – who wrote a letter in support of Arkansas HB 1150 – and Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.).\n###\nAbout APA\nThe Arkansas Pharmacists Association (APA) is the voice of Arkansas pharmacists and is dedicated to promoting public health by advancing the professional and business environment for its members to be successful and fulfilled in serving patients. Founded in 1882, the APA represents over 2,300 members consisting of pharmacists, pharmacy students, pharmacy technicians and members of the industry who support the objectives of the Association. The APA seeks to empower pharmacists to be leaders in integrated healthcare and patient care management as medication experts.

    "text": "[\nStory ProgressBack to home\n]\nMarcus Rashford 'At Home' At Barcelona After Sealing Loan From Manchester United\nMarcus Rashford, who made his United debut in 2015, became an outcast at Old Trafford, with Ruben Amorim publically doubting his commitment and desire.\n- Agence France-Presse\n- Updated: July 24, 2025 08:56 am IST\nMarcus Rashford said his new club Barcelona already \"feels like home\" after the Spanish champions loaned the attacker from Manchester United on Wednesday with a future purchase option. \"Barcelona and Manchester United have reached a deal for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until June 30, 2026,\" announced the La Liga champions in a statement. \"The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.\" Barcelona are paying around 75 percent of Rashford's £325,000-a-week wage ($435,000) while he is at the club, with the player foregoing the rest, according to Spanish reports.\nThe 27-year-old England international was out of favour under United coach Ruben Amorim and spent the final months of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.\n\"I feel like my choice was easy, it's a family club, something I'm used to from my past. It feels like home so I feel like I've made the right decision,\" Rashford told reporters.\n\"I'm just excited to get going and I'm eager to play the first game... it's a special moment for me.\"\nRashford, who made his United debut in 2015, became an outcast at Old Trafford, with Amorim publically doubting his commitment and desire.\nDespite falling out of favour at his boyhood club, Rashford explained he would not criticise the Red Devils.\n\"The situation with United is that the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while, I don't have anything bad to say about Manchester United,\" explained Rashford.\n\"I think it's been an important part of not only my career but just my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them. Football is the same as life and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.\n\"This is my next step, my next chapter. I'm fully focused on this and trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.\"\nRashford will take the number 14 shirt at Barcelona, formerly worn by Thierry Henry among others.\n\"To wear this shirt is an honour and I'm ready to do my best,\" said Rashford.\n\"The club is built on winning and I'm here to try and add to this history.\"\n- 'Ready' for anything -\nIn May, Barca coach Hansi Flick said Rashford and Liverpool winger Luis Diaz were \"fantastic players\" amid transfer links to both, with the club keen to reinforce on the left flank, and also tried to sign Nico Williams.\nLast season the Catalans were irresistible in attack, winning a domestic treble, but had little in the way of back up for key wingers Raphinha and Lamine Yamal.\nRashford could also offer cover for veteran Polish striker Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 in August.\n\"I'm ready for whatever challenges may come, and I'm going to enjoy the ups and the downs, the positives, the negatives,\" said Rashford.\n\"I'm ready for whatever is to come with this club.\"\nRashford, who came through Manchester United's academy, last played for the Premier League club in December, scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances for the Red Devils.\nAt Aston Villa he managed four goals in 17 games before a hamstring injury cut his season short in April.\nBarcelona had trouble registering signings last season with La Liga, including midfielder Dani Olmo, and according to reports may need to find ways to balance the books before registering Rashford and their first summer arrival, goalkeeper Joan Garcia.\n\"Regardless of what happens in the next season, I'm not going to regret my decision,\" said Rashford.\nFew British players have joined Barcelona since the 1980s, when Gary Lineker, Steve Archibald and Mark Hughes all played for the club.\nLineker scored 52 goals for Barca during three years at the club and asked if he could emulate the forward, Rashford said \"I hope so.\"\n\"Of course, it would be good for me to score lots of goals, and be the highest scoring British player to play for Barcelona, but it's more important to me that we win,\" he added.\nrbs/nr/iwd\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "title": "Former Shin Bet head: The war is over and Hamas remains in power in Gaza - Teller Report",
    "text": "Gilon spoke about a massive Israeli intelligence failure (European Archives) Former head of the Israeli Internal Security Service (Shin Bet), Carmi Gilon, said that the war in Gaza has ended, and that the shooting may stop for up to 5 or 6 years. Gilon saw - in an interview he gave to the Israeli Channel 12, excerpts of which were published on Thursday - that the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) received a “strong blow” in this war of revenge, as he described it. But he added that Hamas \"will remain the ruling body in the Gaza Strip as long as there is a vacuum and there is no one to fill it yet.\" Gilon expected that the firing would stop for a period of up to 6 years, after which rocket firing from Gaza might resume, but he said that “the story of what happened on October 7 will not be repeated in my opinion,” referring to the sudden Palestinian resistance attack on Israeli military sites and settlements within the Gaza Strip. Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. He added, \"In my opinion, the war is over, and the only reason for the Israeli army to remain in the field is to return the hostages (the Israeli prisoners in Gaza),\" indicating that military pressure is the only thing that can return them. Regarding the Israeli failure on October 7, Gilon - who headed the Shin Bet between 1994 and 1996 - said, “No one could have imagined this happening. I do not have an explanation related to intelligence, and I believe that as the fighting continues and more facts are revealed about... Hamas' preparations show that the intelligence failure is enormous.\" Since last October, the Israeli army has been waging a devastating war on the Gaza Strip, which as of Thursday left 27,19 martyrs and 66,139 injured - most of them children and women - according to the Palestinian authorities, and caused massive destruction and an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.

    "text": "7月31日，人力资源社会保障部发布《超龄劳动者基本权益保障暂行规定（公开征求意见稿）》，首次明确超龄劳动者基本权益的范围及其保障水平，并为其维权提供了法律依据。\n超龄劳动者，即超过法定退休年龄的劳动者。\n首都经济贸易大学劳动经济学院教授范围表示，此前由于无法直接适用现行劳动法和劳动合同法，超龄劳动者相关权益面临法律保障不足问题，维权时也会遇到依据不明、渠道不畅、体制不顺等困难。\n根据暂行规定，用人单位应当与超龄劳动者订立书面用工协议，明确工作内容、工作地点、工作时间、协议期限、休息休假、劳动报酬、社会保险等事项。用人单位一般不安排超龄劳动者加班，不得安排超龄劳动者从事有职业禁忌等危害其身心健康的劳动或者危险作业。\n针对超龄劳动者难以获得工伤保险保障问题，暂行规定强调，用人单位应当按照国家规定为超龄劳动者参加工伤保险并缴纳工伤保险费。个人不缴纳工伤保险费。\n“将超龄劳动者纳入到工伤保险适用范围，保障了超龄劳动者遭遇工伤后获得赔偿的权利。”中国劳动和社会保障科学研究院劳动人事争议研究室主任黄昆认为。\n退休人员再就业，还能继续领取养老金吗？按照暂行规定，超龄劳动者已享受基本养老保险待遇、职工医疗保险退休人员待遇继续工作的，不改变其享受基本养老保险、职工基本医疗保险待遇。\n“暂行规定充分考虑超龄劳动者享受养老、医疗保险待遇的不同情形，为避免对其就业机会带来影响，对尚未达到基本养老保险或基本医疗保险最低缴费年限的超龄劳动者，提出可以以个人身份继续缴纳有关社会保险费，也可以与用人单位协商通过用人单位参保缴费。”黄昆说。\n如果遇到用人单位恶意欠薪、克扣工资、逃脱保险责任等行为如何维权？\n暂行规定一方面将超龄劳动者的基本权益纳入劳动保障监察、安全生产和职业病防治监督管理的范围；另一方面将超龄劳动者基本权益争议纳入劳动争议调解仲裁的范围，赋予超龄劳动者更加便捷高效的权益保障渠道。\n“这些规定全方位覆盖了超龄劳动者基本权益和其他合法权益保障，构建了司法和准司法部门、行政部门、工会组织多部门协同机制，将推动形成合力，将超龄劳动者基本权益保障落到实处。”范围说，“这是落实积极应对人口老龄化国家战略的必要举措，将让仍有就业意愿和能力的老年人，能够更加安心、舒心地发挥自身劳动价值。”新华社北京7月31日电\n新华社记者 姜琳",
