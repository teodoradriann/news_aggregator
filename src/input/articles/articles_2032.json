    "title": "Plan ahead: Why you should book your holiday 2024 travels now - The Points Guy",
    "text": "It might feel premature to plan your next winter holiday now. However, January can be an ideal time to book travel for next winter using your points and miles.\nMost major U.S. hotel chains and airlines — Southwest Airlines and Choice Privileges are two notable exceptions — let you book award nights and flights 11 to 13 months in advance. Therefore, it's not too soon to start booking your winter 2024 vacation.\nWhy you should book 2024 holiday travel now You'll often find the best rates for peak-season travel when you book early, especially if you're booking with a program that prices its awards dynamically . While a sale price may be offered at some stage during the year, it is unlikely given airlines and hotels have no trouble filling seats and rooms during Thanksgiving and Christmas, given the high demand every year.\nIf you can book an award with minimal change and cancellation fees, it's best to strike early — especially if you're limited to travel during school holidays.\nWith this in mind, here are several trips families should consider booking now.\nBook New Year's Eve 2024 Why not explore the beaches of Bruny Island, Tasmania? KYLE OLSEN/THE POINTS GUY You can book some fantastic New Year's Eve 2024 deals using World of Hyatt points with their attractive award chart rates. Here are the current award and standard cash prices for some of our favorites:\nPark Hyatt New York in New York City : 45,000 points or $1,012 (2.2 cents per point). Hotel 50 Bowery in New York City : 23,000 points or $391 (1.7 cents per point). Andaz Singapore in Singapore : 23,000 points or $434 (1.8 cents per point). Park Hyatt Maldives Hadahaa in the Maldives : 35,000 points or $2,300 (6.5 cents per point). Hyatt Place Dubai Al Rigga : 6,500 points or $355 (5.5 cents per point). Hyatt Centric South Beach Miami : 23,000 points or $906 (3.9 cents per point). Hyatt House at Anaheim Resort/Convention Center California : 18,000 points or $902 (5 cents per point). I can virtually guarantee that these options will disappear — or at least become significantly more expensive — as the 2024 holiday season approaches. The same can be said for airline redemptions. So, go ahead and snag some award tickets with free or inexpensive change and cancellation fees (and then periodically check for price drops ).\nRelated: Our 2023 credit card predictions and trends: What did we get right and wrong?\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy .

But if your family regularly travels to the mountains (or wants to) during the winter season — and you want to maximize your points and miles — now is an ideal time to book a ski trip for December 2024 or January 2025.\nHere are some options for redeeming World of Hyatt points at popular ski destinations for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend next year, which should easily give you at least TPG's valuation of World of Hyatt points.\nHYATT.COM This award availability likely won't last. You might end up snagging a last-minute Hyatt award at a decent rate, but expect rates in programs that use fully dynamic award pricing to skyrocket.\nIf you have a collection of Marriott Bonvoy points, redeem them for five nights and get the least expensive night free on most Marriott stays. If you're seeking total luxury, consider redeeming 540,000 Marriott Bonvoy points to spend five nights just before Christmas at St. Regis Park City .\nAlthough that might sound steep, the same room booked on cash would cost $11,433. That means you'd get around 2.1 cents per Marriott point, almost three times our valuation .\nPrevious slide\nNext slide 1 of 2 MARRIOTT.COM 0 1 A more budget-friendly Marriott option is the Element Basalt-Aspen, which offers complimentary parking. Here, you can reserve a studio king room with a sofa bed and a fully stocked kitchenette with a cooktop, dishwasher, microwave, sink, full-size refrigerator and freezer.\nFive nights here just before Christmas costs 236,000 points or $1,901. By using points, you're getting about 0.8 cents apiece, which is close to our valuation of Bonvoy points .\nPrevious slide\nNext slide 1 of 2 MARRIOTT.COM 0 1 If you're a Hilton Honors elite member, you can also get a fifth night free using points . If you have Hilton points, consider the Hampton Inn & Suites Tahoe-Truckee.\nWhile this property doesn't offer ski in-ski out access, it should open winter award bookings soon. We expect rates around 41,000 to 60,000 points per night.\nRelated: Planning a family ski trip this winter? Here's what you need to know\nBook 2024 Thanksgiving and winter break travel KOLDERAL/GETTY IMAGES Even though cash rates could fall in the next couple of months, don't delay booking award flights for the holidays.\nRight now, if you fancy spending Thanksgiving 2024 in Paris, you can book round-trip business-class flights for 176,000 United MileagePlus miles per person. This is a good deal for such a high-demand travel period when round-trip cash fares start at about $3,000 per person.\nWith United using dynamic pricing , you can expect the number of United miles required for travel during this period to rise sharply the closer it gets to departure. So, this would be a savvy time to lock in a great redemption.\nUNITED.COM Or, for something a little closer to home, you could fly to Miami or Fort Lauderdale for Thanksgiving week for just 21,000 United miles round trip in economy, saving at least $200 off the equivalent cash fares.\nUNITED.COM For Christmas and New Year's 2024-25, different airlines release award seats at different times, though they are usually released between 331 days and 354 days in advance. Check this guide for the dates your program of choice loads seats, noting your preferred travel dates for next winter may not yet be loaded.\nBRITISHAIRWAYS.COM Award space on flights can be unpredictable. So, if you're not finding what you're looking for, consider setting ExpertFlyer (owned by TPG's parent company, Red Ventures) alerts. That way, ExpertFlyer will notify you if a seat(s) becomes available.\nHotel award space generally becomes more limited closer to the holidays. Whether it's a trip to visit grandparents or an action-packed family cruise , take a few minutes to survey potential trips now and make some flexible award bookings.\nRelated: TPG's 10 top family vacation destinations\nBottom line Last-minute award steals can happen, but families with set travel itineraries during peak seasons are best-served planning trips well in advance. Prices are not likely to become cheaper as the date approaches.\nPlans can change, but jumping ahead of the curve with refundable award reservations can make for the ideal vacation.",

    "title": "CLU’s interim president hopes to lead with empathy",
    "text": "Since beginning his role as interim president of Cal Lutheran University on June 1, John Nunes has immersed himself in the campus culture.\nHe can be seen shaking hands with faculty at concerts and athletic events, learning how to speak Spanish to connect with more students, and waving to Thousand Oaks residents from the golf cart he drives around campus. He believes that connecting with the community matters.\n“I’m called and I’m honored to serve,” said Nunes during an interview hours after his Aug. 29 installation ceremony. “I pray every morning and every night and sometimes I say, ‘Just pinch me’ because this job is such a great job and I thank God every day for the opportunity to serve.”\nMost recently serving as the pastor at Pilgrim Lutheran Church in Santa Monica, Nunes considers his current position the next step in his mission.\nHe said his career has been spent in the faith-based nonprofit space in an effort to help marginalized communities flourish.\nHe was CEO of Lutheran World Relief, a member of the Bipartisan Policy Centers’ Academic Leaders Task Force on Campus Free Expression, a senior fellow at the Center for Religion, Culture and Democracy, and president of Concordia College New York from 2016 to 2021 when the school closed.\nHe describes his leadership style as one of decisiveness but, most importantly, empathy.\n“I’ve really worked hard to be collaborative and transparent and to engender an environment where everyone is valued and everyone has a voice,” Nunes said.\nWith students of color making up 54% of its undergraduate population and 38% of the population being first-generation college students, CLU has the ability to transform lives, he said.\n“I come from a family that has flourished due to the benefit of an education and the access to an education,” said Nunes, who holds a doctorate of philosophy from Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago. “Education is the best anti-poverty program that we have in the United States.”\nThough he was hired on a two-year interim basis to replace CLU President Lori Varlotta, whose resignation became effective May 31, he sees his role as more than a mere placeholder.\n“Two years means there’s some work to be done in the interim, and I’m really excited about that,” he said.\nHe plans to lead a thorough analysis of the university’s business model and budget challenges. This will likely result, he said, in difficult decisions that are necessary to adapt the university and its programs to the current environment of higher education.\nEnrollment has dropped roughly 23% since 2019, and from 2019 to 2023, total operating revenue decreased 4%, according to university data.\nPerhaps the president’s top priority, however, will be improving CLU’s relationships in the community.\n“The board is really concerned around strengthening the culture at California Lutheran University, and bolstering trust and confidence and joy on campus among faculty and staff,” Nunes said. “I hope I can be helpful in that.”\nDuring her four years as president, Varlotta faced criticism regarding her relationships with students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors and community partners. Critics claimed former U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly’s lawsuit and the departure of the Los Angeles Rams under her leadership damaged the university’s reputation, and she received an overwhelming vote of no confidence by faculty in January.\nFaculty leaders told The Acorn that Nunes has already improved campus morale.\n“I am very hopeful about Cal Lutheran’s future under President Nunes’ leadership,” said Sharon Docter, chair of the Faculty Senate.\n“Nunes already has established very positive relationships with students, faculty, staff and the broader community. He is an inspirational leader who has a keen understanding of what a special place Cal Lutheran is,” she said.\nMichael Hart, faculty representative to the Board of Regents, said: “I have found him to be thoughtful, open to dialogue and collaboration, and very perceptive.”",

    "text": "Són les 07:30 hores del matí i un vagabund deambula, arrossegant els peus, davant de les portes de l' Escola Andana de Sant Antoni . És un sense llar \"conegut al barri\" i amb qui els veïns ja s'han mobilitzat en el passat perquè els serveis socials li donessin una mà amb la drogoaddicció . En va.\nTWITTER - DANIEL SIRERA\nBrutor, drogues i incivisme en una zona escolar: el dia a dia a la superilla de Sant Antoni Aquests últims mesos, el problema \"s'ha agreujat\". Diversos veïns de la superilla han denunciat tant a Metròpoli com per xarxes socials que l'estat d'aquesta persona sense llar ha empitjorat i es troba en una fase “molt final” .\n“De vegades va amb els calçotets a mig baixar, brut i descalç. L'altre dia me'l vaig trobar i parlava amb algú que no existia, haurà de tenir al·lucinacions ”, ha explicat una veïna a aquest mitjà, que afegeix que l'home ha perdut les seves capacitats.\nXeringues i alcohol Ha explicat com l'ha vist drogar-se davant de la gent , fins i tot amb xeringues que després s'han trobat als jardins davant de l'Escola Aldana. Els seus deliris han arribat a tal punt que parla sol i crida “com un boig” a les persones que passen pel seu costat.\nEscola Aldana de Sant Antoni Òscar Gil Coy Barcelona\nEl sense llar dorm davant de l'escola, una confluència on passen molts nens perquè és la zona d'accés per a l' Escola Ferrán Sunyer , Escola Infantil Apolo 10 i l' Escola Rubén Darío , a més de l'Aldana.\n“La Guàrdia Urbana ens ha dit que si ell no vol marxar, no es pot fer res . Tampoc el poden obligar”, ha explicat la veïna. Durant l'horari escolar, però, els agents s'asseguren que el vagabund s'allunyi del col·legi, tot i que torna per les tardes i els caps de setmana.\nMalgrat tot, als bancs de la superilla del carrer Aldana acostuma a haver-hi altres persones “bevent alcohol” i deixen aquí totes les llaunes i ampolles .\nUna ampolla de cervesa buida als bancs enfront de l'Escola Aldana de Sant Antoni Òscar Gil Coy Barcelona\nNou assentament El focus d'incivisme davant de l'Escola Aldana s'ha expandit i ha arribat a la cantonada del carrer del Comte Borrell amb Marquès de Camp Sagrat . Unes vuit o nou persones han instal·lat un assentament amb tendes de campanya, cartons i ferralla on sembla que “ fan trapitxejos ”, i hi ha un negoci de venda ambulant.\nEls veïns han vist com una parella es dedica a passar droga a les tardes. “És un popurri de coses que ens dona molta inseguretat”, han lamentat.\nA més, aquestes persones sense llar \"han convertit el carrer en el seu lloc habitual de consum de drogues , la qual cosa agreuja la imatge de brutícia i oblit del barri de l'Eixample\".\nDiverses carretillas a la cantonada del Comte Borrell amb el carrer Marquès de Camp Sagrat Òscar Gil Coy Barcelona\n“Abandonament total” Fa anys que els veïns de la superilla de Sant Antoni denuncien l’\" abandonament total \" que pateix el projecte urbanístic els últims anys en aquesta zona de l'Eixample.\nHan reclamat solucions als Consells de Barri, audicions públiques i fins i tot a la Guàrdia Urbana, però \" ningú els escolta\" .\nLa veïna que ha parlat amb aquest digital es queixa perquè des que es va crear la superilla , hi ha més espai i menys trànsit, un fet que a parer seu \" ha propiciat més inseguretat a una zona que fa frontera amb els barris del Raval i Poble Sec.\nDenúncies al ple del districte La consellera del Partit Popular a l'Eixample , Sonia Devesa , ha realitzat diversos precs al ple del districte i en audicions públiques per denunciar la situació al carrer Aldana i la cantonada dels carrers Comte Borrell i Marquès de Camp Sagrat.\nL'última denúncia va ser el 26 de març, de la qual encara \" no ha rebut resposta del consistori\" . També va reclamar solucions al febrer, octubre i agost, quan li van contestar que \"el departament d'atenció social al sense sostre en el servei públic coneixia els fets i feia un seguiment\".\nPati i bancs davant de l'Escola Aldana de Sant Antoni Òscar Gil Coy Barcelona\nDispositiu coordinat de l'Ajuntament Fonts municipals han indicat a Metrópoli que l'Ajuntament intervé en aquest àmbit de Sant Antoni amb un dispositiu coordinat dels diferents serveis municipals, entre els quals hi ha neteja , Guàrdia Urbana , serveis socials o l' Agència de Salut Pública .\n“Existeix i es valora el funcionament del dispositiu coordinat de diferents serveis que permet intervenir i netejar els punts detectats del barri on és necessari intensificar o reforçar l'actuació”, han reconegut.\nDes del consistori, han destacat especialment la feina que fan els equips d'atenció social i els educadors de l'Agència de Salut Pública de Barcelona, que “està pendent de la situació” , per atendre les persones sense sostre i els consumidors de drogues de la zona.\nDues persones dels serveis socials “El problema dels serveis socials al districte de l'Eixample és que només tenen dues persones al carrer, llavors, no arriben a tot”, ha assegurat la consellera del PP.\nUna de les solucions que reivindiquen els populars és injectar més inversió pública a aquest servei, ja que són persones vulnerables que “necessiten ajuda”.\n“Pot ser que si s'hagués intervingut abans amb el noi sense sostre del carrer Aldana, no hauria arribat a l'estat d'ara, que sembla un autèntic zombie quan està drogat. Fa un any i mig no estava tan malament. A què esperem? A què es morin al carrer? Això és inhumà”, ha criticat Devesa.\nPunt de seguretat Al principi de la legislatura, explica la consellera del PP, van demanar des del partit que es realitzés un consell de seguretat a l'Eixample . Durant la seva celebració, van demanar un punt de policia per a l'àmbit de sota el Mercat de Sant Antoni, ser un punt calent, però \"no van obtenir resposta\".\nUna carretilla a la cantonada del Comte Borrell amb el carrer Marquès de Camp Sagrat Òscar Gil Coy Barcelona\nA pesar de la lluita veïnal persistent, als residents els costa cada cop més alçar la veu per \"por a les represàlies que poden patir\".\nMolts d'ells s'han obert comptes anònims a xarxes socials per denunciar públicament el que succeeix als seus carrers. “És una confluència on passen molts nens i hi ha drogues i inseguretat. Els veïns ens hem mogut tot el que hem sabut, però ningú fa res ”, han lamentat.\n*Aquest article ha estat traduït automàticament usant intel·ligència artificial\nNewsletter Metropoli Apúntate a la newsletter de Metrópoli, para recibir las noticias más importantes de la ciudad.

    "text": "Désireuse de poursuivre et d'amplifier la modernisation des formations sanitaires et sociales, dont elle est l'une des pionnières, la Croix Rouge Française a présenté il y a quelques semaines un état des lieux d'un projet ambitieux et innovant. Baptisé APP'IM SASO, ce programme, sélectionné dans le cadre d'un appel à projet « compétences et métiers d'avenir » (AMI CMA) lancé en 2022, est porté par Croix Rouge Compétence, l'organisme de formation de l'association d'aide humanitaire en collaboration avec un consortium composé des groupes VYV 3 et Colisée, deux acteurs spécialisés dans le secteur sanitaire et social et de deux sociétés spécialisées dans les nouvelles technologies (My Serious Game et Domoscio).\n Secteur en pleine transformation « Ce programme a pour objectif de répondre aux défis grandissants d'un secteur en pleine transformation qui connait de des mutations rapides tant technologiques qu'organisationnelles », explique Amélie Rochefort, cheffe du pôle ingénierie pédagogique chez Croix-Rouge Compétence. APP'IM SASO a pour objectif, non seulement de concevoir un dispositif de formation immersif et transverse aux filières sanitaires et sociales, mais également d'apporter un accompagnement au développement des compétences des acteurs de la formation.\nOutils numériques de pointe Au-delà de l'acquisition de connaissances théoriques, APP'IM SASO met l'accent sur la pratique professionnelle, en intégrant des outils numériques de pointe. « Grace à des simulateurs de conversation, des environnements immersifs et des serious games, les apprenants sont plongés dans des situations concrètes et réalistes. Ces outils permettent de développer des compétences transversales et collaboratives, directement applicables sur le terrain », précise Amélie Rochefort. Le simulateur de dossier patient informatisé permet, par exemple, aux apprenants de prendre des décisions « éclairées », de collaborer avec des équipes pluridisciplinaires et de s'adapter à des contextes variés.\nAlternance entre théorie et pratique « L'alternance entre théorie et pratique, couplée à l'individualisation des parcours grâce à l'intelligence artificielle, permet aux apprenants de progresser à leur rythme tout en devenant immédiatement opérationnels », explique Amélie Rochefort. Au total, 20 scénarios de découvertes métiers vont permettre 8 000 mises en situation de candidats sur les 3 ans. Plus de 16 000 apprenants seront accompagnés par le dispositif immersif et digitalisé sur les parcours de formation de niveau bac et infrabac et 11 000 pour le niveau licence. Par ailleurs, 300 formateurs seront formés à l'animation de formation multimodale et 300 maîtres d'apprentissage-tuteurs seront formés à l'accompagnement d'apprentis. Enfin,10 parcours de formation adaptatifs permettront l'individualisation des parcours de 18 000 apprenants sur les 3 ans.\nDéveloppement de neuf compétences « Notre projet est ambitieux car il doit permettre le développement de neuf compétences au travers de six domaines de connaissances », souligne Amélie Rochefort. Outre la contribution budgétaire du consortium (1 million d'euros), le projet a reçu le soutien financier de l'État, via la Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (2,5 millions d'euros).",
