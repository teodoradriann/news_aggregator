    "title": "Central America's Solar Revolution and the Rooftop Revolution in the U.S.",
    "text": "In the heart of Central America, a revolution is quietly unfolding. It’s not fought with guns or protests but with panels and policies. As the sun rises over Panama, Guatemala, Jamaica, Colombia, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic, it brings with it the dawn of a new era in energy. The catalyst? Solar power, heralded as the most cost-competitive energy source in the region until 2050. This revelation comes from a comprehensive report, shedding light on the burgeoning focus on solar energy across Central America and beyond.\nA Bright Future: Solar's Dominance in Central America\nThe landscape of Central America, blessed with abundant sunlight, is witnessing a transformative shift towards renewable energy. A myriad of renewable energy tenders and projects are unfolding across the region. Countries are embracing the sun’s bounty, recognizing solar power’s pivotal role in their energy future. Panama's vast solar farms, Guatemala's community solar projects, and the Dominican Republic's ambitious solar initiatives underscore a collective march towards sustainability. These efforts are not just about harnessing the sun's power but are a testament to a region's resolve to rewrite its energy narrative.\nChallenges and Opportunities: The Path to Solar Adoption\nHowever, the journey to solar dominance is strewn with challenges. The deployment of solar technology faces hurdles, from financing woes to grid infrastructure inadequacies. These obstacles underscore the urgent need for innovative financing models and critical upgrades to the existing grid infrastructure. The report highlights these issues while also pointing to the opportunities they present. For instance, the advent of new financing mechanisms could unlock vast solar potential, making renewable energy accessible to more communities across the region.\nRooftop Revolution: The U.S. Embraces Solar\nMeanwhile, far from the Central American isthmus, the United States is witnessing a rooftop revolution. The newly released 'Rooftop Solar on the Rise' report illuminates the significant growth of small-scale solar energy. Astonishingly, rooftop solar alone possesses the potential to fulfill 45% of the nation's electricity demand. This growth is not incidental but the result of supportive public policies, community programs, and clean energy initiatives championed by local and state leaders. These efforts underscore the critical role of legislation and public engagement in driving the adoption of rooftop solar, setting a precedent for other nations to follow.\nYet, the path to a solar-powered future is not without its hurdles. The European Technology and Innovation Platform for Photovoltaics (ETIP PV) recently published a whitepaper that delves into the socio-economic and technological challenges facing solar deployment. It discusses the importance of social acceptance, public engagement, and the need for a skilled and diverse workforce. Furthermore, it calls for innovative research to reduce the use of critical raw materials and for the design of grid tariff schemes that promote community acceptance and sustainable growth. The document is a clarion call for a balanced approach to solar energy deployment, emphasizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks to ensure sustainability.\nIn conclusion, as Central America and the United States continue to chart their courses towards a solar-powered future, they do so in the face of both vast opportunities and significant challenges. From the need for innovative financing and grid infrastructure upgrades to the importance of community acceptance and public engagement, the journey is complex. Yet, the commitment to a sustainable energy future, underscored by the growing focus on solar power, shines as a beacon of hope. It's a narrative of transformation, marked by the collective efforts of nations to harness the sun's endless bounty for a brighter, cleaner tomorrow.",

    "title": "Portland General Electric's Q4 2023 Earnings Surpass Expectations and Set a Path for a Decarbonized Future",
    "text": "In a recent financial disclosure that has caught the attention of investors and industry analysts alike, Portland General Electric (PGE) unveiled its Q4 2023 earnings, surpassing expectations amidst a landscape of operational challenges and market uncertainties. With analysts projecting earnings of $0.878 per share and sales hitting $740.2 million, a notable increase of 7.75% from the previous year, PGE has not only met but exceeded these forecasts, marking a significant turnaround from the prior year's losses.\nFinancial Milestones Amidst Market Volatility\nIn an impressive display of resilience, PGE reported a GAAP net income of $68 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. This performance, up from $50 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the same period of 2022, underscores the company's robust strategy in navigating the turbulent energy market. This achievement is particularly noteworthy considering the analysts' anticipation of a profit per share of $2.56 for the current fiscal year, a stark contrast to the previous year's loss of $2.61.\nStrategic Initiatives for a Decarbonized Future\nAmidst this financial comeback, PGE has not lost sight of its long-term strategic goals. Early in 2023, PGE made a significant move by filing its first combined Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and Clean Energy Plan (CEP) with the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC). This comprehensive strategy outlines PGE's roadmap to achieve ambitious emission reduction targets by 2030, 2035, and 2040, signaling a committed shift towards an equitable and decarbonized grid. The plan estimates a need for approximately 3,500 to 4,500 MW of renewable energy and non-emitting capacity to meet the 2030 emissions reduction benchmark. On January 25, 2024, OPUC gave its nod to PGE's IRP, albeit with certain conditions, reinforcing regulatory support for PGE's quest for near-term resource additions as detailed in the Action Plan.\nProactive Measures Against Wildfire Risks\nIn addition to its strides in clean energy, PGE has proactively addressed the growing concern of wildfire risks exacerbated by climate change. The utility's 2024 Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) submitted to the OPUC outlines a detailed approach to mitigating wildfire risks. This plan not only reflects PGE's commitment to safeguarding its operations and the communities it serves but also earmarks significant financial investment towards these efforts. The 2024 WMP anticipates $45 million in operations and maintenance costs, with an additional $43 to $49 million allocated for capital investments in various wildfire mitigation activities. This strategic foresight underscores PGE's holistic approach to operational sustainability and community safety.\nPortland General Electric's Q4 2023 earnings report paints a picture of a company on the rise, adeptly navigating the complexities of the modern energy landscape. By outperforming financial expectations and laying down solid plans for a sustainable and secure future, PGE is setting a precedent for how utilities can operate efficiently and responsibly in an era of uncertainty. As the company continues to invest in renewable energy resources and innovative solutions to mitigate environmental risks, its journey remains a beacon of progress and resilience in the face of challenges.",

    "title": "'Doctor Who' Episode 'The Well' Earned Praise From Deaf Consultant",
    "text": "The scariest episode of this Doctor Who season also was an illuminating one, for showrunner Russell T Davies.\nThe Saturday, April 26 episode, “The Well” — which series leads Ncuti Gatwa and Varada Sethu both flagged (in the video above) as the season’s “scariest” hour, and “a psychological thriller” — takes place 500,000 years in the future, on a brutal planet that is home to a devastated mining colony which has only one survivor.\nRose Ayling-Ellis with Varada Sethu and Ncuti Gatwa Courtesy of Disney Rose Ayling-Ellis, an English television presenter and writer of children’s books whose previous acting credits include EastEnders and Casualty , plays that lone survivor of an unspeakable incident, named Aliss.\nAyling-Ellis has been deaf since birth, but that quality was not endemic to the character as originally conceived.\n“Aliss wasn’t written as a deaf character,” Davies told TVLine ahead of the new season. “But then Rose’s name came up, and she’s acted for long time on British television, and I instantly said yes. Because she’s just wonderful .”\nDavies went on to say that one reason to “cast diversely,” as he happened to do here, is because all involved can learn a thing or two along the way. In turn, an episode of TV can only get better.\n“It was a delight to work with Rose. As I talked with her, we put things into the script I never would have thought of,” he recalled. “She modified things, and we modified things….”\nAfter submitting the script for “The Well” for a compliance reading — where typically “they tell us what we’ve gotten wrong , which is exactly the way it should work,” Davies explained — this time “it came back with such a glowing report.”\nIn fact, one of the few notes he did receive celebrated a line of dialogue, about how hearing people can get paranoid around those who are quietly signing. “ I’ve never seen that said out loud before ,” is what Davies said the impressed consultant on deafness reported back.\nAs for Ayling-Ellis’ acting performance as Aliss, “I don’t want to give away too much…,” the showrunner hedged, adding: “Is she the villain? Maybe she’s behind it all?”\nBut this much he affirmed: “Oh my God, she gives so much that your heart absolutely goes out to her. I’m so lucky to talk about her, and to work with her.”\nWant scoop on Doctor Who , or for any other TV show ?

    "title": "‘Sannyasins should not intermingle with politics’",
    "text": "By Jayant B Dave The transformation into a higher ideal or reality is the goal of life, as inner spiritual transformation is far more significant than outer secular life. This renunciate life is common to all religious faiths and calls for renunciation of worldly possessions and, more importantly, ahamkara, ego, and attachments. The glory of religions will be lost if we remove these hermits, who lead a life of renunciation and divine contemplation. They are harbingers of divine wisdom and peace. The fourth ashram, stage, of life called sannyas facilitates attaining realisation of Supreme reality and liberation; the previous three ashrams are preparatory and gateway to sannyas. This inner transformation can be perceived most vividly in the lives of spiritual luminaries. Swami Sivanan daembodied this transformation from professionalism to sagehood, intellect to intuition, self-sacrifice to self-enlightenment,apara vidya to para vidya, and ignorance to realisationof Self. Worldly greatness is nothing compared to spiritual enlightenment. Scriptures – sruti, smriti, and epics such as Mahabharat – describe renunciation’s supreme glory and splendour. Sannyas is necessary even if one has attained advaitic realisation, as exemplified by Ramakrishna, his Guru Totapuri, and Rishi Yajnavalkya. Sannyas sublimates worldliness and establishes one in abstract meditation. The ochre-coloured cloth reminds one of the pledge to lead an austere life in search of the Divine every moment. Just as we have postgraduate students and research scholars in modern education, we need their counterparts to study and research subtleties of mind, meditation, and atman, the substratum behind orderly existence. Sannyas and Vedant are inseparable. Wherever vedant is present, the highest form of sannyas must be found; otherwise, it becomes mere intellectualism. Sannyas without vedant or parabhakti is devoid of fruit. When both merge, a sage of supreme wisdom emerges. Sannyas empties an individual of ego, and vedant fills him with positive truth, says Swami Sivananda. He recommended a combination of meditation and service to sannyasins. They purify the world even by staying in remote places through their thought vibrations. Being followers of the pure nivritti way of life, they should not intermingle much with politics or societal world except for guiding others on philosophy, religion, and spiritual subjects. His recommendation to renunciate was to sit in a quiet room for amoment. Enquire, cogitate, investigate, and realise the glory of living in Atman. Sannyasins should, on their part, be rooted in cosmic consciousness. They behold the oneness of Self, and the benefit to all beings is spontaneous. Adopting the life of a sannyasin when the quest for contemplating on Brahmn/ Self ripens or living life in the spirit of renunciation is essential. According to Swami Sivananda, happiness comes when an individual merges with God. Self-knowledge is the solution to multifarious problems in life. June 1 marks the centenary of Swami Sivananda’s sannyas diksha Top Comment {{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}} [...

    "text": "A winter weather advisory was issued by the National Weather Service on Friday at 6:04 a.m. in effect until 5 p.m. for East Slopes of the Oregon Cascades.\nThe weather service states, \"Snow Above 4000 feet. Additional snow accumulations between 1 and 3 inches around pass levels and between 4 and 8 inches in the higher elevations.\"\n\"Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low visibilities to create difficult driving conditions,\" says the weather service. \"Slow down and use caution while traveling.\"\nWinter weather driving safety: Navigating the chill with expert tips from the weather service Winter weather can make driving treacherous, leading to over 6,000 weather-related vehicle fatalities and over 480,000 injuries each year. When traveling during snow or freezing rain, prioritize safety by slowing down. In near-freezing temperatures, it's safest to assume that icy conditions exist on roadways and adjust your driving accordingly. Be cautious of ice accumulating on power lines or tree branches, which can lead to snapping and falling hazards. If possible, avoid driving in such conditions. If you must venture out, opt for routes with fewer trees and power lines. Never touch a downed power line, and immediately dial 911 if you come across one. Here are additional winter weather driving tips:\nShare your travel plans:\nWhen traveling out of town in hazardous winter weather, inform your family or friends of your destination, planned route, and estimated time of arrival.\nPrepare your vehicle:\nEnsure your gas tank is full and equip your vehicle with essential winter supplies such as a windshield scraper, jumper cables, a small shovel, flashlight, cell phone, blanket, extra warm clothing, drinking water, and high-calorie non-perishable food.\nStay calm when stranded:\nIf you become stranded, stay composed. Notify someone about your situation and location. Avoid attempting to walk to safety. Attach a cloth to your car's antenna or mirror to signal that you require assistance. Make your vehicle more visible by using the dome light and flashers.\nBe mindful of snow plows:\nKeep an eye out for snow plows and provide them with ample room to pass. Only overtake a plow when you have a clear view of the road ahead.\nCheck road conditions:\nBefore embarking on your journey, verify the current road conditions to make informed travel decisions.\nStay safe on wintry roads with these valuable winter driving tips from the weather service, and reduce the risk of accidents during challenging weather conditions.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "text": "You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit [image gallery](/image_purchases) to purchase the image. Former Dunedin singer Marla Kavanaugh says she cannot return to New Zealand because she fears for her life after savage online attacks, hate mail and media coverage following her performance of the national anthem before the All Blacks’ match against Fiji in San Diego last month. Kavanaugh’s mother, Kathi Craig, and her stepfather, Malcolm Hopwood, yesterday issued a statement saying the \"vitriol, hate and accusation\" towards their daughter had made her feel so vulnerable she did not return home for a scheduled concert this month. The concert had been postponed. \"We fear we’ll never see our daughter here again.\" \"Despite the positive reception she received from the crowd in the stand and New Zealanders at the after-match function, more than 50,000 Kiwis, in the privacy of their own homes, attacked her performance. \"Over the days that followed they continued to attack her personally, her family and then went on to threaten her life and her safety on Facebook, Tic Toc [sic], Instagram and other social media outlets.\" Just over a fortnight on, extreme messages continued to be received. In addition to social media, New Zealand newspapers and radio chose to publicise the criticisms and personal attacks, \"even to the extent of running a poll\", they said. They were particularly concerned about a comment made on Three’s 7 Days programme, where Kavanaugh was described by panellist Vaughan Smith as \"Dunedin’s most well-known murderer\". The reaction went far beyond expressions of opinion about her classical voice, they said. Kavanaugh, originally from Dunedin, performed at the Edinburgh Tattoo in 2022 and recently sang at Tartan Week in New York. Kavanaugh had also performed in concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York and in Europe and Russia. Mr Hopwood said he had laid a complaint with Warner Bros Discovery regarding the 7 Days comment, and would be referring it also to the New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority. \"There is a duty of care from those people who monitor social media, TV3 [Three] and New Zealand Rugby who engaged her and then sat back and let events unfold,\" Ms Craig said. \"Until Megan Alatini, who we so appreciate, spoke up about the impact that unnamed personal attacks can have on people in the public eye, no-one sought to align themselves with her and what she was going through. \"As a mother I feel for my daughter and the pain and hurt she is experiencing from people who wouldn’t put their name to such loathsome comments.\" Mr Hopwood said he hoped NZR would play a recording of the anthem at the All Blacks v Argentina match in Wellington tomorrow \"so the blood-letting doesn’t happen again and people can concentrate on the words\". A New Zealand Rugby spokeswoman said the organisation had reached out to Kavanaugh to offer its support and thank her for being involved in the San Diego test. \"NZR also stands firmly against abuse of any kind. It does not meet the values of rugby. But Mr Hopwood told the Otago Daily Times it had taken a week before a member of the rugby union contacted his stepdaughter and she should have received a call to ask after her wellbeing \"much earlier\" than that. He would have expected the chief executive to personally become involved. \"I also believe they could have championed her, which they never have. \"She was engaged by them and when the hate mail arrived, there was little involvement by them — and still there is little involvement.\" A spokeswoman for Warner Bros Discovery, which owns Three, said 7 Days was a comedy show that discussed the previous week’s topical affairs. \"In the week this episode aired, Kavanaugh’s performance was discussed at length across multiple media platforms. \"While panellists take part in this show and express personal opinions, we assessed it to be unlikely the general public would have interpreted Mr Smith’s comments as an accusation that Ms Kavanaugh is a murderer. \"Three does not condone hate speech or threats to individual safety and we wish Ms Kavanaugh all the best in her career.\" Mr Hopwood said what Smith said had no qualification to it, and people could take from it the literal truth of his words. \"It just came out as an ugly statement ... there was no comedy about it. Yes, it was a comedy programme, but there was no humour in what he said.\"",

    "text": "消费清单背后的家长钱包新考验。\n一年一度高考季， 为了犒劳孩子，一场消费狂欢正在拉开帷幕。最新款电子设备、心仪已久的旅行目的地、医美套餐、考驾照，这些被称为\"高考四件套\"的消费清单，正在成为新晋大学生家庭的标配。翻开家长们的消费记录，数字令人咋舌。一部新款手机七八千元，一次毕业旅行三四万，再加上各种隐形消费，一个普通家庭为庆祝孩子金榜题名的花费不可小觑。不少家长在社交平台晒出的账单，也引发了众多共鸣。在消费热潮的背后，除了父母对孩子的疼爱，也暗藏着攀比的压力。当“别人家孩子”都拥有最新款电子产品时，不少家长坦言”不买怕孩子受委屈“。商家更是抓住这一商机，推出各种毕业季限定优惠，进一步刺激着家长们的消费神经。这份考后消费清单，是给孩子最好的成人礼，也是家长们钱包的新考验。“花十万送孩子上大学”高考前，为了给儿子打气，我和他爸爸提前跟他商量了考后奖励的事情。孩子在班里虽然不算特别拔尖，但也一直挺努力，为了激励他在最后阶段好好冲刺，我们跟他承诺，只要考上一本线，就奖励他两万块钱，让他自由支配这笔钱。孩子听到这个特别激动，经常跟我提起上大学之后要怎么规划这笔钱，也算是对他这三年辛苦的嘉奖吧。高考完肯定得给他换新电子设备，孩子早就做好了功课。手机选了Apple 15pro，电脑选了Macbook Air m3，趁着暑期教育优惠活动，总共花了一万四左右。本来想着要给他再买个ipad，但孩子觉得现在用处不大，所以想等大三考研的时候再买。他最大的兴趣就是打游戏了，虽然我觉得打游戏没什么问题，但是整个高中阶段，为了不影响学习，还是严格控制他玩游戏的时间。现在高考结束，就给他买了他一直想要的Switch游戏机，他特别激动，每天晚上都拉着他爸一起玩。出国旅游是我们早就答应孩子的奖励。他向往已久的新加坡之旅终于实现了。为了这次旅行，我跟他爸提前做了不少攻略，订机票、选酒店、规划行程，他一考完我们就去了，想趁着还没出成绩先好好放松一下，大概花了四万元。孩子玩得特别开心，我觉得这个钱花得挺值的，毕竟多出去看看总是好的。暑假孩子还准备去考个驾照，我已经给他报好了驾校，花了5000多，等报完志愿就开始学。这几天成绩出来了，孩子发挥得挺不错，上一本没什么问题，就是报志愿让我们全家都有点焦头烂额，需要考虑的事情太多了，每天都在研究录取分数线和专业排名的事情，实在是太忙了。不过该有的奖励肯定一样都不能少，我跟他爸开玩笑说：“现在想风风光光地送个孩子上个大学，没有个十万块钱还真下不来。”“孩子懂事不攀比，觉得够用就行”我们家孩子是美术艺考生，为了考自己理想的大学，女儿这几年真是用全力了，努力学习集训，我觉得真挺不容易的。高考结束后，朋友圈里满屏都是家长的晒单。什么最新款手机、笔记本电脑、平板电脑、智能手表，我觉得大家有点夸张，多少有点攀比的感觉。但肯定还是要问问孩子想要什么，毕竟这几年这么辛苦，合理的要求我们都想尽力满足。结果发现孩子特别懂事，一点不攀比，什么都跟我们商量着来，也没有不给买就不高兴的破事儿。我们本来想着得给她换个新款的iphone，但她觉得手机够用就行，不用太贵的，自己做了攻略，挑了一个vivo的手机，花了2500块，小姑娘爱美，想着拍照好看就行。因为她要学设计类的专业，所以对电脑的配置要求还是比较高，我们当然全力支持，选了联想的拯救者Y7000P，花了8000块钱，学设计的这个配置也能带得动了。其他的花费就是做做头发做做美甲什么的，上高中一直没法打扮自己，高考完孩子最激动的事情就是可以变美了。陪她染了头发做了美甲，一共花了1000多。关于旅游计划，我们一家达成了共识：\"与其去景点人挤人，不如去上海姑姑家放松几天\"。女儿从小就和姑姑特别亲，每年暑假都盼着去上海。在姑姑家的小区里散步，去熟悉的咖啡馆看书，这样的假期反而更让人期待。算下来，女儿高考后的花费远没有其他家庭那么夸张，但每一分钱都花在了刀刃上。最让我欣慰的不是省下了多少钱，而是女儿展现出的懂事和理性。在这个物质丰富的时代，能够保持清醒的消费观，懂得量力而行，这份成熟远比任何昂贵的礼物都珍贵。“高考结束第二天，开启变美计划”看着女儿高考结束后如释重负的样子，我和她爸爸都知道，她心里惦记着一件重要的事——割双眼皮。其实，这个想法她高二就有了，每次照镜子都会对着自己的单眼皮叹气，但为了不影响学习，我们跟她约定好等高考后再考虑这件事。高考结束的第二天，女儿就翻出手机里收藏的各种整形医院案例给我们看。为了确保安全，我们真是全家出动做攻略。又是查医院的资质和医生的执业资格，又是在小红书上进医美交流群，向做过手术的家长取经。我们跑了三家医院面诊，每到一个地方，女儿都会认真地和医生沟通自己想要的款式，我和她爸则更关心手术的安全性和恢复期的问题。最终我们选择了一家三甲医院的整形科，虽然价格比私立医院贵一些，但胜在安全有保障。手术现在已经做完了，所有费用算下来差不多1万多。我觉得这个钱花得挺值，之前就看韩国那边流行给孩子变美基金嘛，我们也算是帮孩子完成变美的计划了，让她能更自信地去上大学。除了这个最重要的事情，其他的花费就在买电子设备和旅游了，手机电脑其实她一直都有，但还是想换个更新款的手机，我们也答应了，花了5000多。孩子辛苦这么长时间了，犒劳一下也是应该的。至于旅游计划，女儿早早就和闺蜜们约好了要去三亚玩。她说等眼睛恢复得差不多了，正好可以戴着新买的墨镜去海边拍照。为了培养她的独立能力，我特意准备了一万元的旅游基金，让她自己负责规划行程、预订酒店。我觉得这是一个很好的锻炼机会，以前都是我们带着她出去，这次全都让她自己来，而且有同龄朋友一起，也让她享受享受自由的感觉。“养宠物、做眼睛，花3万实现孩子心愿”高考结束那天下午，我去考场门口接女儿，立刻就问了她想要什么，她歪着头想了半天，说除了养猫和做眼睛手术，其他的没什么缺的了。手机是高二时姑姑送的生日礼物，虽然用了两年，但保护得很好，女儿说完全够用，没必要换新的。不过考虑到大学学习需要，我们还是决定给她买台笔记本电脑。最后选了Matebook14，花了4799元。女儿挺开心的，说这下写论文、做PPT都方便了。我知道她一直心心念念的就是养猫，每次路过宠物店都要在那儿看好久，但之前学习太忙了，也就没提这件事。高考前她就跟我们约定，等考完一定要实现这个愿望。现在终于到了兑现的时候，我们前几天带她去猫舍挑了一只金渐层，花了3800元，再加上杂七杂八的猫咪用品，一共差不多5000块钱。另一个重要决定是做全飞秒手术。女儿从初中就开始戴眼镜，运动时特别不方便。我们咨询了好几家医院，最后在三甲医院选了口碑最好的医生，花费差不多一万八。手术约到了7月份，她一直期待能把眼镜摘掉，也马上就要实现了。所以算下来我们差不多花了3万块钱，虽然数额不算小但是也没有那么夸张，主要是满足了孩子一直期待的小愿望，我们都挺开心的，就算是给她的毕业礼物了，毕竟也是迈入人生的新阶段了。",
