    "text": "Digiday is at Possible giving you the latest industry news out of the event in Miami. More from the series →\nLinda Yaccarino continues to cast X as the anti-media media company — a disruptive alternative to what she and Elon Musk believe is the dusty, broken fourth estate.\nIt’s a contentious claim, especially in an era when President Donald Trump is once again at war with the press. But sitting for a fireside chat with Anthony Pompliano, creator of From the Desk of Anthony Pompliano, on X at Possible this afternoon in Miami, Yaccarino insisted the platform’s (self-reported) numbers back her up.\nAccording to the platform’s CEO, X has nearly amassed 600 million monthly active users (MAUs) globally — a small increase on the 586 million MAUs that were reported in X’s own tools in January, but not a huge increase on the 570 million MAUs X claimed it had reached back in September 2024.\nStill, nearly a third (31%) of that user growth is coming from Gen Z — drawn in, apparently, by a taste for authenticity and disposable income. Yaccarino pointed to their projected $36 trillion in spending power by 2024 as proof.\n“X has emerged as the world’s most powerful culture signal, it really has become the global town square,” she said. “Where ideas collide, debate happens, truth rises and truly every voice is welcome.”\nSuggesting that X has “bypassed or leap frogged legacy media,” Yaccarino claimed that 65% of its users identify the platform as their No. 1 news app.\n“The new population, new generation, fueled by technology which has freed information, all of data and content consumption has changed forever,” she said.\nIn many ways, these comments reflect the twisted reinvention of Twitter’s premise. Before Musk bought it in October 2023, the social network prided itself on being a hub for credible news and trusted sources. Now, the divisive billionaire wants X to be the source — arguing again and again that unfiltered speech should replace what he dismisses as “legacy media.”\nNowhere is that shift clearer than in how X handles misinformation, hate speech and other content most users would rather avoid. The company scrapped many of its automated moderation systems in favor of “Community Notes” — crowdsourced fact checks and context from the user base — which now, according to Yaccarino, has 1 million “community noters” globally. In her view, the feature is “good for the world” because it’s “retraining us to respect the truth,” she noted.\n“I think it’s really, really hard for legacy media to fact check and fight misinformation in real time, at the scale, the way X can, and now Community Notes, being the ecosystem leader,” she said.\nBut the tool was never meant to carry the full weight of content moderation. It was designed to supplement, not replace, more robust systems like internal review teams and AI tools for flagging obvious falsehoods.\nSince X launched this feature globally in December 2022, others have followed suit, from Meta to TikTok, effectively deciding that people don’t need journalism when they have each other.\n“We’re super excited that first Google, then Meta, more recently TikTok is partnering and following our lead in a dramatic ecosystem change of fact checking and aggressively fighting misinformation,” Yaccarino added.\nIf X’s higher ups want to position the platform as the antidote to news then AI is the engine driving the drive. That’s how Yaccarion spun Musk’s decision to sell X to his AI startup xAI. While its widely seen as a financial play — fold X into the AI boom and benefit from the revenue bump But its just as likely a data play: merging the two companies would give xAI access to the digital exhaust of X’s users to help train its models.\n“When you bring those two things together, you have this profound differentiator because the other AI offerings are static, and they are not powered by the real time data of X combined with the super, super capabilities of X,” said Yaccarino.\nFor better or worse, X is unique\nLike many of the other platform CEOs, Yaccarino certainly wasn’t afraid to talk her platform up and discredit the competition during her conversation with Pompliano.\n“If you compare X to the other platforms, the other platforms are where you go to lean back, dare I say tune out,” she said. “X is number one in attentiveness compared to all the other social platforms. So you’re leaning in, you’re seeking out information.”\nCompared to Yaccarino’s previous stage efforts as CEO of arguably one of the most talked about and controversial platforms, this time around at Possible, she had confidence in abundance.\nBut what was very absent from the chat, given Possible is an advertiser event, was any real clue about how X is managing to sway those advertisers to spend on the platform. And it seems like that thought wasn’t lost on the audience either.\nIn the queue to get into Inspiration Hall ahead of Yaccarino’s stage moment, Digiday asked execs waiting in line about how they thought the audience would receive her this time around, given the series of mixed headlines about X and its leadership over the past couple of years.\nTwo media agency execs, who asked not to be named, expressed mixed opinions. “I think there is some simmering resentment that might uncork, but we’ll see,” said the first agency exec, who was barely audible as an onstage DJ spun earsplitting Reggaetón as the audience trickled into their seats.\n“I think it would be very disrespectful,” if she was heckled in any way, said the second exec. “But we’d like to hear some assurances that ad sales negotiations with X will take place in the marketplace and not in court,” they added.\nBut Pompliano never touched on lingering brand safety concerns on the platform, or the legal actions it has brought to advertisers that have been reticent to market via X.\n— Jim Cooper contributed reporting to this story",

    "text": "It’s almost a throwback to summer this weekend in Southern Indiana as temperatures near 80 degrees make a brief comeback. While far from muggy, more humid air flowing in as soon as Saturday morning will keep low temperatures from dipping much past the lower 50s. This and abundant sunshine mixed with a few clouds Saturday afternoon sets us up for high temperatures near and just above 80 degrees. You’ll likely be able to get away with shorts and T-shirts the whole day and into the evening as temperatures won’t fall terribly much Saturday evening, with 70s likely until just after dark. We’ll wake up to upper 50s and lower 60s on Sunday morning, which is certainly warm for this time of year. Despite a cold front and a few clouds moving through in the afternoon on Sunday, we’ll only see a very small chance for an isolated shower and sprinkle during that time. High temperatures will also get close to 80 degrees again as the cooler air behind this cold front won’t arrive until late Sunday evening. That cold front will be the catalyst for a markedly cooler weather pattern next week, one that takes us down into frost territory by Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings. This is when overnight lows will get down into the 30s across the region. While a freeze is somewhat unlikely, rural and suburban frost potential is certainly there. High temperatures in the afternoons next week will only top out in the 50s and 60s. weekend FORECAST SATURDAY Partly sunny HIGH: 82° SUNDAY Partly sunny Isolated shower (10%) HIGH: 80°",

    "text": "GA based Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. - Savannah is urging the community to get in touch with a wrongful death lawyer if a loved one recently passed away under suspicious circumstances. If their passing was the result of another party’s misconduct or negligence, a wrongful death claim can help survivors obtain compensation for their loss and suffering.\nKenneth S. Nugent, P.C. offers the community a free initial consultation if they wish to speak with a legal professional regarding their options. Upon examining their case, the firm will explain what can be done to move forward. Further, the firm works on a contingency basis, so they will accept payment for their services only if the case has a positive outcome. See more here: Wrongful Death Lawyer Macon .\nThe firm states, “A loved one’s sudden passing is always a traumatic event, and most people in this situation will want little more than to grieve their loss in peace. Unfortunately, there are often a number of practical concerns that must be dealt with regardless, such as funeral expenses, loss of income, medical bills and so on. We’re here to reassure you that you will not have to face these concerns on your own — and we will pursue the compensation you are legally entitled to on your behalf.”\nThe firm has represented numerous clients in such cases, and they say that a common theme among survivors is the belief that no amount of compensation would be able to equate the loss of their loved one. While this is incontestably true, compensation is intended to alleviate their suffering as much as possible, and the firm strongly advises survivors to pursue it, especially if the deceased individual was the sole income earner in their family.\nWrongful death cases are notoriously complex, and it can be a daunting prospect to navigate the legal system. This is why it is advisable for anyone in this situation to hire an experienced wrongful death lawyer who will investigate and advocate on their behalf. Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. has a long history of successful cases, and they are proud to offer their services to anyone who needs assistance with a wrongful death claim.\nThis assistance can take many forms. According to the firm, it is often necessary to obtain evidence to establish liability, proving conclusively that the death in question was a result of negligence (or even an intent to harm). The team may gather evidence, interview witnesses, review medical records, consult with experts and so on as the case proceeds.\nWorking with a firm as reputable and large as Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. also has a number of other advantages. Experts, for instance, are more likely to work with such firms, especially if they have an existing working relationship. The insights from such professionals, such as accident reconstruction specialists, can do much to support a wrongful death claim and ensure a successful outcome.\nThis is extremely important since insurance companies (and defense attorneys) will likewise do their utmost to avoid liability altogether or at least minimize settlements in wrongful death cases. Countering them requires both an intrinsic knowledge of the law as well as deep negotiation skills, backed by strong evidence. The best way to combine these factors and present an ironclad claim is to work with a wrongful death lawyer who is accustomed to dealing with such challenges.\nThe firm makes it a point to make every client feel as if they are valued and prioritized at all times, and this applies in all manner of cases. “Amazing experience,” says one client of the firm. “I had a minor car accident so it wasn’t going to pay them out that much, but they still treated me great, and the communication was exceptional. My case manager, Amanda, always responded within a day to any of my questions or concerns, and my legal assistant, Lauren, literally replied within minutes of my emails every time! I was always kept in the loop, and everything was thoroughly explained to me. I would 1000% recommend, their good name has absolutely been earned!”\nSavannah residents may contact the firm via phone or email to schedule their free initial consultation. Further details regarding wrongful death cases, the firm’s broader services and more can be found on the official website of Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C.\n Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. - Savannah,\nKenneth S.

    "text": "Une nouvelle année débute et, avec elle, la promesse de projets d’ampleur pour de futurs entrepreneurs. Certains ont déjà fait du chemin et savent que 2024 sera l’année où ils ouvriront leur franchise. Pour ceux-là, voici 4 idées d’activité pour ouvrir une franchise en 2024. Quels sont les domaines où se développent la franchise ? Quel secteur d’activité choisir pour se lancer ? En 2024, certains secteurs semblent particulièrement attractifs et promettent d’être porteurs. Voici le top des secteurs franchisés en 2024. L’année 2024 sera marquée par la mise en place de Ma Prime Adapt’. Cette aide financière est conçue pour faciliter l’adaptation du logement des personnes en situation de perte d’autonomie ou de handicap. Gérée par l’Agence nationale de l’habitat (ANAH), elle doit entrer en vigueur lundi 1er janvier 2024. Cette offre de l’État va populariser le marché de l’adaptation en France, augmentant ainsi naturellement la demande. Elle représente une belle opportunité pour les acteurs du marché de l’aménagement. C’est le cas de réseau de franchise comme DOMetVIE et Mobilaug qui se préparent à répondre à cette demande. Créé en 2012, [DOMetVIE](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/franchise/dometvie/) est le premier réseau de franchise dédié à l’adaptation du domicile des seniors et PMR, afin de leur permettre de rester chez eux le plus longtemps possible en toute sécurité et confort. Le réseau compte aujourd’hui 60 points de vente. Pour ouvrir une agence DOMetVIE, le futur franchisé doit apporter au moins 30 000 euros pour un investissement global de 80 000 euros. [MOBILAUG®](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/franchise/mobilaug/), quant à elle, favorise depuis 2015 la rupture de l’isolement social et permet à toute personne à mobilité réduite, senior ou en situation de handicap, de se sentir à nouveau bien chez elle, de retrouver l’accès à toutes les pièces de son domicile et de vivre une vie de famille normale. Pour ouvrir une franchise Mobilaug, le candidat à la franchise doit apporter au minimum 25 000 euros pour un investissement initial de 74 000 euros. Dans un contexte économique français en constante évolution bancaire, réglementaire et juridique, le rôle du courtier en financement professionnel s’impose comme un métier d’avenir. En facilitant l’accès au financement pour les entreprises, ces professionnels contribuent au développement économique du pays et accompagnent les dirigeants d’entreprise dans leur prise de décision stratégique. Parmi les acteurs de ce secteur, on retrouve l’enseigne [CrediPro](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/franchise/credipro/), dédiée à tous les entrepreneurs, quels que soient leurs projets ou la taille de leur entreprise. Depuis 2009, le réseau a accompagné plus de 14 600 chefs d’entreprise pour près de 4 milliards de crédits obtenus grâce à plus de 100 courtiers présents en France, métropolitaine et DOM-TOM. Pour devenir franchisé CrediPro, il faut un apport minimum de 25 000 euros, pour un investissement de 50 à 80 000 euros. De son côté, [Pretpro.fr](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/franchise/pretpro-fr/) est un réseau national d’experts dédié au financement des professionnels. Née en 2006, l’enseigne développe une solution d’accompagnement à la recherche de financement des réseaux de franchise dans un premier temps, puis s’étend à tout type de professionnels indépendants ou en franchise. Pour rejoindre Pretpro.fr, le franchisé doit apporter au moins 15 000 euros pour un investissement total de 25 000 euros. La Loi climat et résilience adoptée en août 2021, a sonné le glas des passoires thermiques et autres bâtiments énergivores pour atteindre un objectif de neutralité carbone en 2025. L’un des grands chantiers de cette loi est l’immobilier et le gouvernement a renforcé l’arsenal visant à réduire la consommation des bâtiments. Les propriétaires bailleurs et les particuliers, encouragés par des systèmes d’éco prêts à taux zéro, de subventions ou encore de primes comme MaPrimeRénov’, se lancent dans des travaux de rénovation globale comprenant un versant rénovation énergétique. Une aubaine pour le secteur du bâtiment et ses acteurs. Parmi ces professionnels, on retrouve [Uniso](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/franchise/uniso-france/), une marque 100% dédiée au marché de l’isolation extérieur de maisons individuelles. Créée en 2014, l’enseigne se développe en franchise depuis 2017 et compte aujourd’hui 15 implantations en France. Pour ouvrir une franchise Uniso, l’entrepreneur devra apporter 70 000 euros pour un investissement de 100 000 euros. La rénovation thermique représente une réelle opportunité dont [Camif Habitat](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/franchise/camif-habitat/) s’est saisie dès l’adoption de la nouvelle réglementation, en 2021. Depuis, [l’enseigne forme ses franchisés à la réalisation d’audits énergétiques](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/articles/camif-habitat-pret-a-repondre-au-boom-de-laudit-energetique/), désormais obligatoires avant la vente d’un logement classé F. Pour devenir franchisé Camif Habitat, l’entrepreneur doit apporter entre 15 000 et 20 000 euros, pour un investissement global de 60 000 euros. La seconde main est devenue une tendance de fond. Porté par les évolutions sociétales et le contexte inflationniste, le marché de l’occasion affiche une belle croissance en France. En 2021, ce secteur représentait 9 milliards d’euros de chiffre d’affaires. Et les chiffres vont continuer de s’affoler puisque le cabinet Xerfi estime que le secteur pèsera 10 milliards d’euros en 2025. De quoi faire les affaires des [enseignes historiques du secteur ](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/articles/achat-vente-doccasion-lenjeu-du-juste-prix/)comme [Easy Cash](https://franchise.lexpress.fr/franchise/easy-cash/) dont les points de vente affichent des chiffres d’affaires de 1,9 millions d’euros, soit une progression de 20 % par rapport à trois ou quatre ans. Pour rejoindre l’enseigne, le franchisé doit détenir un apport minimum de 150 000 euros, pour un investissement de départ de 650 000 euros.",

(KOLO) - The Carson City Sheriff’s Office and the Carson City School District are working together to create an initiative that helps teach parents and students how to respond to concerning activities or social media posts.\nThey call it: Report, Don’t Repost.\nThe main goal is to minimize the reposting or posting of threats of violence or possible incidents because that makes it harder for law enforcement to identify where an incident may be occurring or originated.\n“We so frequently are so tangled in a web of ‘where did this threat originate from’ and ‘how can we best approach who all is involved.’ The reposting just creates more data and people we have to go through, and it seriously hampers investigations,” says Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong.\nIf students or parents come across posts that threaten violence, harm or injury, they are encouraged to:\nAvoid reposting with others, as this only escalates fear and panic.\nTake a screenshot of the post.\nReport the post to local law enforcement, a school administrator or teacher\nCopyright 2024 KOLO.

    "text": "All-inclusive? Von wegen: Wie Hotels ihre Gäste austricksen\nZum Frühstück Sekt und „Käse bis zum Horizont“: Ein Hotelexperte verrät, wie sich all-inclusive für Hotels rechnet und für welche Urlauber es sich lohnt.\nWas haben\nEltern mit Kindern und Menschen, die im Urlaub gerne viel Alkohol trinken, gemeinsam? Für beide lohnt sich am ehesten ein Urlaub im All-inclusive-Hotel, sagt der Hotel- und Gastroexperte Michael Bauer. „Die Rechnung geht für den Gast nur auf, wenn man gerne Alkohol konsumiert. Sonst wird es schwierig, den Preis zu rechtfertigen“, erklärt er BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA. Auch Eltern gehören zur Zielgruppe, weil Kinder ständig etwas essen und trinken wollen würden. „Mit einem All-inclusive-Paket nervt das nicht mehr.“\nDrei Cappuccinos zum Frühstück, um 10 Uhr den ersten Prosecco,\nKinder, die abwechselnd Fanta, Eis oder Pommes fordern – für die entsprechenden Zielgruppen rechnet sich das All-inclusive-Paket also. Doch mit welchen Strategien beeinflussen Hotels ihre Gäste, um am Ende trotzdem Gewinn zu machen?\nTricks, wie All-inclusive-Hotels ihre Gäste im Urlaub beeinflussen\nHotels kalkulieren genau, was ihre Gäste konsumieren. „Bei Getränken rechnet der Hotelier zum Beispiel mit Pauschalen: Mehr als vier Cappuccinos trinkt niemand“, sagt Bauer. 4,70 Euro Wareneinsatz pro Person würde in etwa für Kaffee und Frühstück reichen. Beim Speisenangebot am Bufett würden die Hotels mit günstigen Sattmachern und Füllern arbeiten: „Hühnerbeine kosten fast nichts, Spaghetti-Salat macht satt und ist billig. Frische Komponenten findet man da oft nicht“, sagt Bauer. Beim Dessert sehe es ähnlich aus: Wassermelonen und Softeis für die Kinder – das sei günstig und fülle das Bufett.\nMit einfachen Tricks erwecken\nAll-inclusive-Hotels bei ihren Gästen den Eindruck einer breiten Auswahl. „Ein gutes Beispiel ist der Käse am Bufett. Da wird billiger Käse im Block gekauft, und ein guter Küchenchef schneidet ihn in Scheiben, Dreiecke und Würfel, legt ihn auf silberne Platten und präsentiert ‚Käse bis zum Horizont‘. Der Kunde denkt dann: ‚Was für eine Auswahl!‘ Aber in Wahrheit ist es immer derselbe Käse“, sagt Bauer. Mit kleinen Gläsern am Bufett könne das Hotel seine Gäste bei den eher teuren frischen Säften bremsen. „Sie müssten öfter gehen, und das macht fast niemand.“\nAuch bei alkoholischen Getränken hätten die All-inclusive-Hotels ihre Strategien. Inländische Spirituosen, Bier und Wein seien dabei, aber kein Bordeaux-Rotwein aus erster Lage. Stattdessen gebe es günstige Marken, die als Tischwein in vielen Clubs ausgeschenkt werden würden. „Teure Export-Spirituosen schließt der Hotelier aus, um sich abzusichern“, sagt Bauer BuzzFeed News Deutschland.\nWoran Gäste ein wirklich gutes Hotel erkennen\nDer Experte verrät, woran Gäste ein wirklich gutes Hotel erkennen: „Am Müsli!“ Gute Hotels hätten meist eine Getreidemühle, würden das Getreide frisch schroten. Manchmal werde es dann über Nacht in Orangensaft eingelegt. Am nächsten Tag kämen Apfel,\nNüsse und Beeren dazu. „Das sind die kleinen Details, an denen man erkennt, ob ein Hotel Qualität liefert oder spart“, erklärt Bauer.\nAll-inclusive-\nUrlauber wissen schon bei der Buchung, was sie am Ende bezahlen und können sich frei auf dem Hotel-Gelände bewegen. Damit dieses Konzept nicht von Touristen aus anderen Hotels ausgenutzt werde, gebe es in All-inclusive-Hotels sehr starke Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, weiß der Hotelexperte Bauer. „Die Anlagen sind vom Zutritt her gut geschützt, mit Security und Bändchen. Externe erkennt man schnell, etwa an anderen Handtüchern“, sagt er. Doch das Bändchensystem habe Schwachstellen. Es gebe nicht viele Hersteller, und Muster könne man sich gegen Geld besorgen. „Wenn jemand wirklich tricksen will, ist das immer möglich.“",

Más de una veintena de magrebíes iban a bordo de esta pequeña embarcación, que por fortuna ha podido alcanzar la costa sin incidentes.

Detrás de estas expediciones abundan las mafias, que cobran precios muy elevados a personas vulnerables prometiéndoles el desembarco en tierras europeas.\nA finales del pasado año, murieron cuatro inmigrantes en esta misma zona tras ser arrojados desde una patera taxi. A bordo de la embarcación viajaban al menos 37 migrantes que habrían pagado entre 3.000 y 12.000 euros por el trayecto entre Kenitra (Marruecos) y Cádiz.\nLa Asociación Unificada de la Guardia Civil ha lamentado que «mientras la patrullera del Servicio Marítimo está en la Feria de Sevilla, el trabajo en nuestras costas no cesa.
