    "title": "Baseball-sized hailstones hit Texas as 200,000 across South remain without power",
    "text": "Hailstones the size of baseballs landed in Texas on Thursday, as a spate of storms and severe weather left more than 200,000 energy customers across five states in the South without power as cleanup operations begin. Footage verified by NBC News from Johnson City, Texas, shows enormous hailstones at least 5 inches in diameter — large enough to break an SUV's rear window. One hailstone was an estimated 6.25 inches across, which would make it the second largest ever found in Texas. There only been four verified hailstones over 6 inches since 1950. Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes brought havoc to the Midwest and then through the Southeast this week, where at least three people died as a result of weather events. Hail the size of golf balls hit Granbury, Texas. Canaan Horn Almost 95,000 energy customers in Alabama were without power as of 7 a.m. ET, according to PowerOutage.us , as well as 57,000 in Mississippi and 50,000 in Florida. Georgia and North Carolina each had about 17,000 power outages. The bad weather is over for most but some 7 million people are at risk of severe weather Friday morning, with an \"enhanced risk\" of intense storms and winds of up to 70 mph for parts of Florida, the National Weather Service office in Jacksonville said. NBC News Dallas-Fort Worth spoke to families in Pecan Plantation, southwest of Fort Worth, whose houses were battered by hail the size of golf balls. Medic Lydia Torres told the station that the sound of hail landing on her ambulance was like a bomb. \"It sounded like bombs were hitting the top of the ambulance. Especially when it hit the top of the windshield, you could see the glass start to shatter everywhere,\" she said. She said she and her partner were on a call when hail forced them to scramble for shelter. \"It looks like a paintball hit him in the back of his shoulder blades,\" she said. Windows and skylights were smashed across the community, although some children were keen to collect the hailstones as frozen souvenirs. Meanwhile in Maury County, Tennessee, which experienced widespread destruction from tornadoes this week, Columbia Fire & Rescue released drone footage showing the extent of the damage and the scale of the cleanup operation to come. Entire houses have been laid to waste, while large sections of wooded areas are now without trees. County officials offered affected residents advice on how to separate and dispose off the debris . As for next week, flash flooding is a big concern along the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, where between 5 and 7 inches of rain is expected.\nPatrick Smith Patrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.\nKathryn Prociv Kathryn Prociv is a senior meteorologist and producer for NBC News.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "SRI RACHA, Thailand – In a captivating display of faith and reverence, villagers from the serene town of Sri Racha embarked on a pilgrimage to seek blessings from an ancient and revered entity: the “Mother Takhian” tree trunk. This remarkable tradition unfolded within the sacred grounds of Khao Chong Lom Temple, where spirituality intertwines with nature. The centrepiece of this pilgrimage is the awe-inspiring “Mother Takhian” tree trunk, measuring an impressive 4.5 meters (approximately 14.8 feet) in length. Locals believe that this venerable tree harbours good fortune, and recent events have only strengthened their conviction. The catalyst for this pilgrimage was the recent emergence of a lottery jackpot winner in the vicinity. Word spread like wildfire, and villagers flocked to the sacred tree, hoping to tap into its mystical energies. The “Takhian” tree’s storied past adds to its allure: it first captured attention in 2018 when it was discovered in an old well. Subsequently, it was offered at Wat Phan Sadetnai Temple in Bo Win Sub-District, where its reputation as a bearer of blessings began to take root. In 2020, the ancient tree found its permanent abode at Khao Chong Lom Temple, nestled amidst lush greenery and serene surroundings, where both locals and devoted pilgrims are drawn to worship Thao Thong Lon. Devotees gather regularly to pay homage and seek blessings, particularly during the lead-up to lottery draws. As part of the age-old tradition, offerings are made to both Thao Thong Lon and the sacred “Mother Takhian” tree trunk. These offerings include traditional Thai attire, cosmetics, clay dolls, and red coloured soft drinks, an expression of reverence and gratitude. The intertwining of human devotion and natural spirituality underscores the deep-rooted beliefs that persist in this region.",

    "text": "ART\n“Hi ha risc de danys irreparables”\nEl director del Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC), Pepe Serra, va assenyalar ahir que té l’“esperança” que el jutjat d’Osca valori la qüestió tècnica del risc de dany en la retirada i trasllat de les pintures murals del Monestir de Sixena. En una trobada amb els mitjans, va assegurar que hi ha un “risc cert, avaluat científicament, de deteriorar el bé”, va dir que els estudis científics portats a terme avalen aquests riscos i va negar que sigui una tàctica dilatòria en aquesta fase d’execució de la sentència ferma.\nSerra va defensar la posició que ha mantingut el museu, ratificada per l’acord del seu patronat i l’incident d’execució presentat davant del jutjat, de preservar el bé i que “complir la sentència implica sotmetre-les a un risc gran de danys irreparables”. També va lamentar que el museu està “condemnat” a executar la sentència i que no existeix la possibilitat que ho facin els tècnics aragonesos. “No tenen l’obligació, ni tampoc han manifestat la voluntat de fer-ho”, va assegurar, i “és important que quedi clar que la responsabilitat ha recaigut en el museu, que està advertint que fer-ho suposa un risc molt gran”.\nPer això, el museu prepara un escrit d’oposició amb nous informes i estudis. “Des de l’inici del litigi sempre s’ha dit que complir la sentència implica sotmetre les obres a un gran risc de danys irreparables”, va subratllar, i va assenyalar que les peces són “vestigis materials” d’una obra que es va calcinar i són “molt fràgils”. Així mateix, es va mostrar preocupat al no tenir prou informació del lloc de destinació de les obres.\nD’altra banda, el grup municipal de Junts per Catalunya de Lleida ha registrat una moció al ple de la Paeria per a la preservació i conservació de les obres. El document pretén manifestar el rebuig de la Paeria a una sentència que “prioritza les reivindicacions polítiques a la preservació del patrimoni històric”.\nSerra nega ingerències polítiques i que dimiteixi\nEl director del MNAC va negar que hi hagi ingerències polítiques i va afirmar que en tot moment el seu pla “tècnic i artístic” s’ha vist “completament ratificat”. Així mateix, va deixar clar que no s’ha plantejat la dimissió, va dir que se sent “molt avalat” i que “no seria el seu estil” abandonar el vaixell en un moment com aquest. Serra també va elogiar la decisió del patronat del MNAC de mantenir viva la comissió de tècnics malgrat que el Govern d’Aragó ha retirat els seus. Mentrestant, el ple de les Corts d’Aragó va aprovar ahir iniciatives presentades per PSOE, PP, Vox, Aragó-Terol Existeix, PAR i CHA per reclamar al MNAC la devolució de les obres. El Jutjat d’Osca va rebutjar dimarts iniciar encara el procés d’execució forçosa a l’espera de rebre les interlocutòries del Suprem que confirmen la sentència.",

Meanwhile, BDCTP GLOBAL is actively exploring emerging areas such as DeFi and NFT to enhance the diversity and attractiveness of its products and services. The platform plans to launch a series of blockchain-based innovative financial products in the next few months, which will further expand its influence in the global market.
