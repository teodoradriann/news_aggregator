Este 7 de eneroВ celebramos el cumpleaños de Arkadas, el perrito pastor alemán que fue donado por Turquía a México.\nLa Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Sedena) le organizó una fiesta petfriendly a este binomio canino en Campo Marte donde hasta le hicieron su pastel.\nMira: Suaves graduados: Perros se reciben como guías para personas ciegas\nAsí fue el primer cumpleaños de Arkadas Recordemos Arkadas es pastor alemán que fue donado a México en mayo del 2023. Esto luego de que Proteo, perro rescatista, perdiera la vida durante sus labores de búsqueda y rescate tras el grave terremoto en Turquía.\nSu nombre, Arkadas, significa amigo y desde su llegada a México se decidió que entrenaría también para ser binomio de búsqueda y rescate del Ejército y Fuerza Aérea Mexicana. Y precisamente es entrenado por el mismo dueño de Proteo, el el policía militar Carlos Villeda Márquez.\nLa fiesta de Arkadas fue este domingo 7 de eneros, donde desde las 08:00 hasta las 11:00 se celebró al cachorro en el Monumento a los Binomios Canófilos el Ejército y Fuerza Aérea Mexicanos “Proteo”, el cual está ubicado en el Campo Marte.\nDesde días anteriores, la Sedena había invitado a la gente a participar en este festejo llevando a sus propio lomitos.\nEn videos en redes sociales se puede apreciar que estuvieron otros binomios de la Sedena celebrando el cumpleaños de Arkadas. Incluso apareció Cadete, el perrito sin hogar que desfiló el 16 de septiembre y fue adoptado por el Ejército.\nCadete, perro adoptado por el ejército, en el cumpleaños de Arkadas.

    "title": "Maps show best areas in U.S. to see northern lights Friday night",
    "text": "The northern lights made an incredible display over much of the United States on Thursday — and might make a return appearance Friday night.\nThe aurora borealis was visible as far south as Florida on Thursday. Photos show the sky lit up in red and purple, even in some brightly-lit areas like New York City and Chicago .\nThe strong geomagnetic storm that created such a show has subsided, according the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but some parts of the U.S. may again see the northern lights tonight. Here’s what to know.\nWhere will the northern lights be visible tonight? The northern lights will be visible for parts of the northern U.S., according to the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center’s aurora forecast . The aurora will be visible over much of Canada and Alaska, but the northern lights can also be seen from as far as 620 miles away if the conditions are right, NOAA says.\nParts of Idaho, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin may be able to see the lights Friday night. On the East Coast, the aurora might be visible in northern New York and parts of Vermont and New Hampshire. Areas of Maine may also see the northern lights.\nThe lights will appear to the north when it’s dark outside. If you can’t see them with the naked eye, they may be visible through a phone camera or other device.\nWhat time will the northern lights be most visible? The northern lights are most visible just after sunset or just before sunrise, NOAA said. The aurora is not visible during the day. Dark, cloudless skies with little artificial light provide the best viewing experience.\nWhy have the northern lights been so visible lately? Over the last several months the sun has been incredibly active, unleashing a series of coronal mass ejections from its surface, CBS Boston reported. That’s resulted in multiple visible aurora shows.\nThe geomagnetic storm responsible for Thursday’s stunning skies is now subsiding, CBS Boston reported. That means there will be less chance of seeing the aurora on Friday, but there may be more opportunities in the future.\nShawn Dahl, a forecast coordinator with the Space Weather Prediction Center, told CBS Boston that the northern lights have been so intense lately because of where the sun is in its 11-year solar cycle . Dahl said that “we are in the midst of solar maximum.”\n“What that means is the sun is now this twisted-up mass of strong magnetic fields, and some of these are so localized and intense they reveal themselves as these sunspot groups,” Dahl said. “That’s the source of a bunch of the space weather storms that we’re looking for and predict.”\nWhat causes the northern lights? The northern lights are caused by interactions between the sun’s solar winds and the Earth’s protective magnetic field, according to NOAA . Those two phenomenons result in geomagnetic storms and increased geomagnetic activity .\nThe higher the geomagnetic activity is, the better your odds are of seeing the aurora. Increased geomagnetic activity means the aurora will become brighter, more active and visible farther from the poles of the planet, NOAA said.\nEven moderate solar wind creates the aurora, NOAA said, so there is usually a weak aurora visible from somewhere on Earth. The best places to see these weaker auroras is close to the planet’s poles, like in Greenland or southern Argentina. If you see the aurora near the North Pole, it’s nicknamed the northern lights. The same phenomenon near the South Pole is called the southern lights.\nKerry Breen\nKerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com. A graduate of New York University’s Arthur L.

BillionToOne's Pioneering Study Demonstrates 100% Accuracy for Non-Invasive Fetal RhD Detection in US Population 28.02.25 00:17 Uhr Werbung Peer reviewed research published in Green Journal shows BillionToOne's NGS technology excels in testing diverse US populations\nMENLO PARK, Calif. , Feb. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BillionToOne , a molecular diagnostics company with a mission to create powerful and accurate tests that are accessible to all, announced today the groundbreaking results from a recent large US-based clinical study demonstrating 100% accuracy in its non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) for fetal RhD status. This is BillionToOne's third peer reviewed study of its fetal antigen assay, and the second published in The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the official journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), also known as \"The Green Journal,\" which showcases the accuracy and clinical validity of BillionToOne's fetal RhD NIPT.\nApproximately 15% of pregnant individuals in the US are RhD-negative. However, in ~40% of these pregnancies, the fetus is also RhD-negative, making RhoGAM administration unnecessary. To date, BillionToOne has conducted RhD testing on 469 participants through clinical validation studies, while providing over 150,000 commercial RhD tests to patients nationwide.\nThis study demonstrates that BillionToOne's proprietary next-generation sequencing (NGS) with Quantitative Counting Template™ (QCT™) technology provides conclusive results with 100% accuracy. BillionToOne's study included all samples, including difficult to identify variants such as RHDѰ and RHD-C-DE , which are often excluded in other studies; therefore, it reflected true clinical performance. Across 401 pregnancies, the test achieved 100% sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value when compared to the ground-truth neonatal RhD serology.\n\"This study provides compelling evidence that our QCT™ technology can revolutionize prenatal care for RhD-negative individuals in the US,\" said Jennifer Hoskovec , VP of Medical Affairs at BillionToOne. \"Our approach accurately determines fetal RhD status even in the presence of complex genetic variants, representing a significant advancement over existing methodologies.\"\nA critical differentiator of BillionToOne's technology is its unique ability to detect challenging RhD variants that other commercial tests typically exclude. The study demonstrated 100% accuracy in identifying fetal RHDѰ variants, found in approximately 25% of Black Rh-negative individuals, and RHD-CE-D hybrid variants. Other commercially available fetal RhD NIPTs are unable to detect the fetal RhD status when these variants are present in the pregnant individual, limiting applicability in a general obstetric population. This capability is particularly crucial for ensuring accurate testing across diverse populations, especially in the US.\nThe research demonstrates clinical validity, with healthcare providers already implementing the test results to guide RhoGAM administration. The study observed a significant reduction in unnecessary RhoGAM administration for pregnancies with RhD-negative fetuses as clinician confidence in the test grew over time.\nThis third major fetal antigen publication from BillionToOne follows a recent ACOG clinical practice advisory update supporting the use of non-invasive cell-free DNA screening for fetal RhD during the RhoGAM shortage, and also as an option in alloimmunized pregnancies when amniocentesis is declined. These ACOG updates cited BillionToOne's previous studies.\n\"By accurately identifying fetal RhD status, we can avoid unnecessary RhoGAM administration in approximately 40% of patients carrying RhD-negative fetuses,\" said first author of the study, Dr. Julio Mateus Nino , MD, Maternal & Fetal Medicine. \"BillionToOne's QCT™ technology also provides critical information for patients with RhD alloimmunization, giving physicians the tools to guide antenatal management based on actual fetal genotype rather than assumption. This is a meaningful advancement in personalized prenatal care that benefits both patients and healthcare systems.\"\nAbout BillionToOne\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, California , BillionToOne is a precision diagnostics company on a mission to make molecular diagnostics more accurate, efficient, and accessible for all. The company's patented Quantitative Counting Template™ (QCT™) molecular counting platform is the only multiplex technology that can accurately count DNA molecules at the single-molecule level as early as 9 weeks gestation.

    "text": "National Budget 2024-25\nMPs to lose tax-exemption privilege on car imports\nThe members of parliament (MPs) are likely to lose the long-standing privilege of exemption from customs duties and taxes on import of cars, jeeps, and microbuses as the government would amend the associated law.\nIn his budget speech on Thursday, finance minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali encouraged all to come out of the culture of tax exemption and asked the minister concerned to make necessary amendments to the law related to tax exemption for the parliament members.\n“We are encouraging everyone to pay tax and to come out of the culture regarding tax exemption. A noble example will be set if the public representatives amend this privilege and lead everyone to come out of tax exemption culture,” he said.\n“I am requesting the concerned honourable minister to make necessary amendment in the members of parliament (remuneration and allowances) order, 1973 accordingly,\" he added.\nCurrently, the parliamentarians are entitled to import cars without bearing any duty, a practice which has been in place for 36 years. However, it leads to a substantial loss of revenue for the government.\nIt was learned that the imposition of import duty is being considered due to the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $4.7 billion loan scheme.\nAs per the law, one importing a car worth Tk 10 million would face an immensely higher cost, including 25 per cent import duty and 500 per cent supplementary duty, totaling at Tk 65 million.",
