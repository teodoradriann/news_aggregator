Because my dad knew his stuff on this topic, I’ve understood since I was a teenager that Jesus was Jewish, but I didn’t know much about the history of the land/region at the time. At Honest Reporting, Jerusalem-based writer Emanuel Miller explained [the complexities](https://honestreporting.com/jesus-was-jew-not-palestinian/) in-depth: Jesus was born in Judea, a client kingdom of the Roman Empire, and identified as a Jew. Jews living there at the time would most likely have described themselves as living in the Land of Israel. Anyone referring to “Palestine” in the first century C.E. would have earned themselves strange look, especially from the indigenous Aramaic-speaking Jews. The land was subject to all the religious laws in Judaism that apply in Land of Israel. A century later, the area was renamed. After a Jewish revolt was crushed in the 2nd Century CE, the vast majority of Jews were exiled and the Roman emperor Hadrian subsequently had the region entitled “Syria Palestina” after the Jews’ ancient enemies, the Philistines, in an antagonistic move designed to demonstrate that the Jews were no longer owners of the land. Put simply, an Aramaic-speaking Jew living a century before this change of name would never have called himself Palestinian. Indeed, while the New Testament mentions Israel and the Jews repeatedly, Palestine is not mentioned even once. Jordan Cope, who is the director of policy education with the pro-Israel group “StandWithUs,” tackled the argument in an Jerusalem Post op-ed [published](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-779313) on Christmas Eve: In reality, Jesus was a proud, observant Jew who lived in his indigenous homeland of Judea and Galilee – from manger to grave. The myth that Jesus was Palestinian, a ploy designed to invite Christians to support Palestinian nationalism, often morphs into deliberate efforts to deny Jews their history, indigeneity, and right to sovereignty in Israel. Ironically, as Jews seek to combat rising antisemitism, now might be a good time to set the record straight on Christianity’s most important figure. […] The term Palestine derives from Philistia after the land of the Philistines, a people originally from the Aegean coastline (modern-day Greece and Turkey). Goliath was defeated and the Philistines disappeared centuries before Jesus was born. After Imperial Rome defeated the third Jewish uprising, Roman forces massacred and expelled massive numbers of Jews from Judea and renamed it: Syria Palaestina. This was in 135 CE, over a century after Jesus’s death (sometime around 27-33 CE). The new name was “to minimize Jewish identification with the land” and punish the rebellious Jews by naming the country after their biblical enemies. As evidenced by the Romans, the erasure of Jewish memory, identity, and culture from Israel has become a mainstay tactic for antisemites over millennia. Even the New York Times of all places had to issue a correction in 2019 to an [op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/reader-center/jesus-images.html) published around Easter that [falsely claimed](https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-times-correction-jesus-palestinian-op-ed) Jesus “most likely” was Palestinian: The op-ed, titled “As a Black Child in Los Angeles, I Couldn’t Understand Why Jesus Had Blue Eyes,” read: “Jesus, born in Bethlehem, was most likely a Palestinian man with dark skin.” The New York Times issued the correction one week after it ran the story and received a barrage of criticism. “Because of an editing error, an article last Saturday referred incorrectly to Jesus’s background,” the Times wrote. “While he lived in an area that later came to be known as Palestine, Jesus was a Jew who was born in Bethlehem.” It was changed to: “But Jesus, a Jew born in Bethlehem, presumably had the complexion of a Middle Eastern man.” In short, saying “Jesus was a Palestinian” is a lot like the “ [from the river to the sea](https://legalinsurrection.com/2023/11/rashida-tlaib-gaslights-on-from-the-river-to-the-sea-gruesome-nova-festival-footage-proves-shes-lying/)” chant. It’s anti-Semitic to the core, and it deserves a sound debunking every time it is uttered. — Stacey Matthews has also written under the pseudonym “Sister Toldjah” and can be reached via [](https://legalinsurrection.com/subscribe/) [DONATE](https://raisedonors.com/legalinsurrectionfoundation/general) Donations tax deductible to the full extent allowed by law.",

    "text": "NEW YORK (1010 WINS/WCBS 880) – A man was arrested for slashing the throat of a church caretaker who asked him to stop urinating on a car in the East Village, police said Friday. Roberto Ortiz, 28, was nabbed Thursday in the East Village and charged with attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of a controlled substance, and false personation. His address is listed as a men's shelter on the Bowery. Police believe Ortiz is the man behind the brutal slashing at East 14th Street and First Avenue on the evening of Jan. 21. The victim—a 54-year-old man who works as a caretaker at the Immaculate Conception Church—was outside the church on East 14th Street at 5 p.m. when he saw a man urinating on a car. When he asked the man to stop, the man whipped out a box cutter and slashed him across the neck, police said. The victim was rushed in critical condition to Mount Sinai Beth Israel, where he received 16 stitches to his neck. The victim later told the New York Post that he decided to confront the man when he saw him urinating on a church wall. \"I can’t let that happen,\" the victim said. The attacker went into a rage and started shouting obscenities at him before cutting his throat. \"I just felt something hot coming down my neck, then I realized I had blood all over my body,\" he said. There have been several reports in recent weeks of public urinators attacking people who confronted them. An NYPD officer was injured in Inwood on Jan. 22 by a man who drove a car at officers who'd caught him urinating in public. And in the West Village on Feb. 14, a man was stabbed in the stomach by a man who he'd asked to stop urinating on a building in the middle of the afternoon, police said.",

Além do desmame, a cantora passa por reabilitação fisioterápica e fonoaudiológica, essenciais para sua recuperação. \"Ela está em um período de internação prolongada para realizar reabilitação e o processo de desmame da traqueostomia\", afirmou o comunicado da instituição.\nARTISTA ESTÁ INTERNADA DESDE JULHO\nA hospitalização de Nana começou no final de julho, quando foi diagnosticada com arritmia cardíaca. A condição exigiu internação na Unidade Coronariana, seguida de uma cirurgia para implante de marca-passo no início de agosto. Após a alta, em 13 de agosto, a artista retornou ao hospital no dia 28 do mesmo mês para novos cuidados. Desde então, permanece sob supervisão médica intensiva.\nO procedimento para o implante do marca-passo foi essencial para corrigir sua arritmia e evitar complicações futuras. A cirurgia, considerada de médio porte, consistiu em inserir o dispositivo por uma pequena incisão no tórax, conectando-o ao coração por meio de eletrodos. Apesar do sucesso do procedimento, a fragilidade da saúde de Nana exigiu monitoramento contínuo e tratamentos complementares, incluindo a traqueostomia.\nFilha do lendário Dorival Caymmi e da cantora Stella Maris, Nana é um dos nomes mais respeitados da música brasileira, com uma carreira marcada por interpretações intensas e emocionantes. Seu estado de saúde mobiliza fãs e colegas de profissão, que torcem por sua recuperação.\nVer essa foto no Instagram",

    "title": "Did twitch always suffer from depression?",
    "text": "Did Twitch Always Suffer from Depression?\nTwitch, the popular live streaming platform, has been a major hub for gamers and esports enthusiasts. However, in recent years, the platform has faced numerous controversies and criticisms surrounding mental health, particularly depression. But did Twitch always suffer from depression? Let’s dive into the history of the platform and explore the answer to this question.\nEarly Days of Twitch\nTwitch was founded in 2011 by Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, and it initially focused on live streaming video games. The platform quickly gained popularity, and by 2013, it had become the go-to destination for gamers to watch and interact with each other. During this period, the platform was relatively small, with a dedicated community of gamers and streamers.\nThe Rise of Twitch\nAs Twitch continued to grow, it became a major player in the gaming industry. In 2014, Amazon acquired the platform for $970 million, and it continued to expand its user base and offerings. The platform introduced new features, such as live streaming of music and art, and it became a major hub for esports and gaming events.\nThe Dark Side of Twitch\nHowever, as Twitch grew in popularity, it also faced increasing criticism and controversy surrounding mental health, particularly depression. Many streamers and viewers began to speak out about the pressures and stresses of the platform, including the constant need to perform, the pressure to maintain a certain image, and the lack of support for mental health.\nThe Impact of Depression on Twitch\nStudies have shown that the gaming industry, including Twitch, has a significant impact on mental health. A study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that gamers who played for more than 4 hours a day were more likely to experience depression and anxiety. Another study by the University of Oxford found that gamers who played for more than 6 hours a day were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.\nThe Effects of Streaming on Mental Health\nStreaming on Twitch can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly depression. Streaming can be a source of stress and anxiety , as streamers feel pressure to perform, maintain a certain image, and interact with their audience. The constant need to be \"on\" and entertaining can be exhausting and draining, leading to feelings of burnout and depression.\nThe Lack of Support for Mental Health\nDespite the growing awareness of mental health issues, Twitch has been criticized for its lack of support for streamers and viewers. There is no dedicated mental health support system in place, and many streamers have reported feeling isolated and unsupported. The platform’s focus on entertainment and community has led to a lack of attention to mental health, and many streamers have spoken out about the need for more support and resources.\nThe Impact of Depression on Streamers\nDepression can have a significant impact on streamers, including:\n• Loss of motivation : Depression can make it difficult for streamers to find the motivation to stream, leading to a decline in their streaming schedule and overall performance.\n• Decreased engagement : Depression can lead to a decrease in engagement with the audience, as streamers may feel overwhelmed or disconnected from their community.\n• Increased stress : Depression can increase stress and anxiety, leading to a decline in overall well-being and mental health.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, while Twitch has always had a dedicated community of gamers and streamers, it has only recently faced significant criticism and controversy surrounding mental health, particularly depression. The platform’s lack of support for mental health has led to a growing awareness of the need for more resources and support for streamers and viewers. As the platform continues to grow and evolve, it is essential that it prioritizes mental health and provides a safe and supportive environment for all users.\nTable: The Impact of Depression on Streamers\nEffect\nDescription\nLoss of motivation\nDepression can make it difficult for streamers to find the motivation to stream, leading to a decline in their streaming schedule and overall performance.\nDecreased engagement\nDepression can lead to a decrease in engagement with the audience, as streamers may feel overwhelmed or disconnected from their community.\nIncreased stress\nDepression can increase stress and anxiety, leading to a decline in overall well-being and mental health.\nBullets: The Need for Mental Health Support on Twitch\n• Dedicated mental health support system : Twitch needs a dedicated mental health support system in place to provide resources and support for streamers and viewers.\n• Increased awareness : Twitch needs to increase awareness of mental health issues and provide education and resources for streamers and viewers.\n• Reduced pressure to perform : Twitch needs to reduce the pressure to perform and entertain, and provide a more relaxed and supportive environment for streamers and viewers.\n• Increased support for streamers : Twitch needs to provide more support for streamers, including mental health resources, counseling, and therapy.",

    "text": "[Society](https://www.panorama.am/en/news/society)15:36 29/12/2023 Armenia Mother See condemns violence against Jerusalem Armenian community The Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin issued a statement on Friday condemning the violence against the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the local Armenian community. The full statement is provided below. \"With deep concern, we learned about the ongoing provocative actions around the Cows' Garden estate belonging to the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. On December 28, more than three dozen armed men invaded the territory of Cows' Garden, carried out violent actions, as a result of which clergymen of the Patriarchate and members of the local Armenian community received various physical injuries. It is obvious that the provocateurs are once again trying to seize the Cows' Garden estate through terror, threats and violent actions, violating the procedures established by the law. Strictly condemning what happened, we hope that the Israeli authorities will respond legally to the criminal acts against the Patriarchate and the Armenian community, the culprits will be held accountable and the repetition of similar cases will be excluded. We express our support to the military Brotherhood of Saints Hakobyan of Jerusalem and the Armenian community, asking for God's help.\" Related news [Lemkin Institute concerned by threats to integrity
