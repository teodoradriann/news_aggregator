    "title": "Prosecuting Trump Is Different From Persecuting the Innocent | Opinion",
    "text": "Trump supporters and their opponents spar outside of the criminal court where former President Donald Trump was on trial on May 29, in New York. One accusation that you can never level at the contemporary Republican Party is &quot;taking things in stride.&quot; Since former President Donald Trump&#039;s swift and unanimous conviction on 34 felony counts in Manhattan last Thursday, Republicans across the country, from pundits to presidential candidates, have absolutely lost their minds, promising revenge and retribution by prosecuting Democrats everywhere for... well, they&#039;ll get back to you about that. The thing they want you to know is that they will now use &quot;lawfare&quot; to prosecute Democrats for unnamed crimes as both retribution and deterrent. And just like what gets released into the atmosphere every time a flimsy MAGA balloon pops, it is mostly hot air. Republicans want everyone to know that they are extremely angry about Trump&#039;s convictions. &quot;It&#039;s time to fight fire with fire,&quot; wrote Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who also took the time to make absurd comparisons to communist show trials. Trump advisor Stephen Miller asked, &quot;Is every Republican D.A. starting every investigation they need to right now?&quot; Former Trump advisor Stephen Bannon—who is, notably, about to go to prison—also urged &quot;dozens of ambitious backbencher state attorneys general and district attorneys&quot; to &quot;seize the day.&quot; (You might be wondering: what is a backbencher attorney general? Don&#039;t get hung up on the details! Just get mad and buy some Trump conviction merch!). The takeaway is that they are so outraged by what they regard as politically motivated prosecutions that they are promising to engage in politically motivated prosecutions. Insert your favorite take on the goose and gander metaphor where appropriate. In the overheated imaginations of MAGA diehards, having random district attorneys in Texas invent criminal cases against Democrats will deter future Democrats from pursuing charges against Republicans who try to perpetrate coups in broad daylight. Unfortunately for them, more than eight years of threatening to prosecute leading Democrats from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama and now President Joe Biden has failed to alter Trump&#039;s basic legal trajectory, which was all but destined to end in felony convictions given his predilection for committing felonies. The best way for Republicans to avoid prosecution—as 99.99 percent of them somehow manage to do day after day—is not to commit crimes and then engage in sloppy after-the-fact cover-ups. Another problem for this nationwide vengeance campaign is that elected Republicans in the House of Representatives haven&#039;t been able to get an impeachment inquiry off the ground despite years of furious digging into the Bidens&#039; affairs. Despite an investigation that has lasted more than a year, Republicans knew they didn&#039;t have much of anything on the president, other than that his troubled son engaged in some influence-peddling years ago. They don&#039;t even have the votes for the kind of half-baked, party-line impeachment that they used against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. As proof of concept for what the far right would like to spend its time doing in the wake of Trump&#039;s convictions, it was a pretty embarrassing spectacle for its leading architects. Knowing that their impeachment quest is dead, outraged Republicans instead promised to obtain the recording of Biden&#039;s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. The horror! Livid Republicans also might want to take a minute to check in with members of their beloved hard-right Supreme Court supermajority, who are taking a break from getting wined, dined, and yachted by billionaires to determine whether presidents wield near-dictatorial powers that make them totally immune from prosecution, before and after they leave office. If Trump wins the election in November, he may very well find himself without any plausible options to retaliate against Joe Biden, even if he can convince some hapless goon to use the attorney general position for naked persecution. And almost any moves prior to the election by Republicans to frivolously prosecute other Democrats could be blunted on Biden&#039;s way out the door with his pardon powers. Republicans should also consider the optics. Robust public opinion majorities in the United States support the investigations of Trump&#039;s efforts to the overthrow the American constitutional system of government in 2020-2021, and believe that his convictions in Manhattan last month were just and proper. Outside the MAGA echo chamber, there is no such groundswell of desire to investigate or prosecute Biden for the very simple reason that not even Trump&#039;s most subservient allies in the House could produce a plausible case. Voters are unlikely to approve of efforts by &quot;backbencher attorneys general&quot; to fabricate cases against Democratic officials, especially when Trump&#039;s allies are out there saying the quiet part out loud as usual. The more that big, mad MAGA media misanthropes and their elected handmaidens talk explicitly about making up cases to persecute people, the less they will be able to focus on the handful of issues that are imperiling Biden&#039;s re-election prospects. Swing voters who are just starting to pay attention to this infernal election might not love what they are hearing from Republicans who seem more focused on retaliation than they are on solving problems. They might just start asking themselves whether Donald Trump has a more coherent plan to bring down Joe Biden than he does to bring down grocery prices and then vote accordingly.

    "title": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car",
    "text": "CINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "title": "Recordando a Allende: Boric conmemora nacionalización del cobre destacando que es el \"sueldo de Chile\"",
    "text": "Recordando a Allende: Boric conmemora nacionalización del cobre destacando que es el “sueldo de Chile” Hoy se cumplen 53 años de la nacionalización del cobre, ocasión donde el presidente Gabriel Boric visitó la división Chuquicamata de Codelco y dio un discurso donde recordó a Salvador Allende y la importancia del mineral para la economía nacional. Previo a la ceremonia de conmemoración, el mandatario visitó las instalaciones desde donde se controlan las operaciones de la mina, para visitar la división subterránea. Luego, Boric brindó el discurso donde sostuvo que “Chuquicamata simboliza la decisión soberana que tomó nuestro país hace 53 años de hacerse dueño del cobre y tomar en sus manos su destino, dando pasos decisivos hacia su soberanía y, como dijera Allende en si discurso del 4 de septiembre de 1970, dar paso a la segunda independencia, la independencia económica de Chile”. Por otro lado, y en línea con lo dicho el año pasado, el Presidente enfatizó en el cobre como “el sueldo de Chile”, tal como lo hizo el ex mandatario Salvador Allende. Boric en conmemoración de la nacionalización del cobre Fuera de esta rememoración, Boric también defendió a la minera estatal de las críticas o cuestionamientos que han surgido en el contexto de las dudas sobre si podrá recuperar sus niveles de producción de cobre. Por ello, señaló que Codelco tiene un futuro “auspicioso” y que “tiene el desafío de aumentar progresivamente su producción a 1,8 millones de toneladas de cobre fino en 2030″. Y en ese sentido, destacó la decisión de “no extraer todas las utilidades de Codelco, sino destinar un 30% de ellas a reinversión en la empresa”. Además, enfatizó en que “¡Codelco no se privatiza! Es más, Codelco no sólo no se privatiza, sino que avanza en nuevas funciones y exploraciones, como lo estamos haciendo con el litio, que tiene que ser profundamente chileno”. Estrategia Nacional del Litio Finalmente, en línea con lo anterior, el mandatario recalcó los avances de la minera de cobre al sector del litio, en el contexto de la Estrategia Nacional del Litio y las diversas alianzas público-privadas que se están llevando a cabo. En esta línea, Boric deslizó que “esto fue motivo de debate y en el sector del gran empresariado no cayó bien, pero no importa porque no les caemos bien (…) Pero acá las decisiones se toman soberanamente por los Gobiernos elegidos, y la decisión de que los salares estratégicos el Estado tenga participación mayoritaria y Codelco va a ser fundamental en aquello, fue una decisión de la que me enorgullezco”. Este martes, desde el Gobierno señalaron que finalmente serán 81 las manifestaciones de interés que se analizarán para el desarrollo de proyectos de litio en Chile. En general, participaron 54 empresas y consorcios de 10 países distintos, mientras que la mayoría de manifestaciones vinieron desde Chile (no necesariamente de empresas nacionales), seguido de Canadá con 11 junto con Australia y Suiza con 4 cada una. Desde el ministerio de Hacienda destacaron que la cantidad de respuestas estuvo por sobre las expectativas iniciales; y de los 26 salares, 16 acapararon el interés de las compañías.",

    "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL — Workers from Clearwater Marine Aquarium have released 11 cold-stunned Kemp’s ridley sea turtles back into the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe turtles were released earlier this week near Cape Canaveral after two months of rehabilitation, the aquarium said in a news release Thursday. They were part of a group of 16 turtles that arrived at the facility from the New England Aquarium in Massachusetts in December. The other five turtles are still receiving care.\n“We are excited to share that 11 of our Kemp’s ridley patients are fully recovered and have been cleared for release by us, as well as Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission,” Shelly Marquardt, a veterinarian at the Clearwater aquarium, said in a statement. “All 11 were ready to go back home to the east coast of Florida into a warmer part of the Atlantic Ocean.”\nHundreds of sea turtles suffer hypothermia and severe debilitation every year in the colder waters of Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts, as the cold-blooded reptiles are unable to regulate their body temperatures.\nRehabilitation facilities in the Northeast frequently collaborate with other facilities to treat cold-stunned turtles. A total of 52 sea turtles were flown this past winter to Florida, where they were treated by Clearwater Marine Aquarium, as well as Mote Marine Laboratory, Florida Aquarium and Loggerhead Marine Life Center.",
