    "text": "Watching clips of legends like Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, and even Mesut Özil must have inspired many young Gooners to dream of making it in professional football. Boys looked at these legends and told themselves, “When I grow up, I want to be like them.”\nInterestingly, girls who want to make it in football have also looked up to these male footballers. For instance, Arsenal Women’s Swedish international Rosa Kafaji, who signed for Arsenal last summer, looks up to Brazilian football legend Ronaldinho.\n“Ronaldinho has been an inspiration since I was younger, and that’s how I try to play,” Rosa says . “I want to be creative, have fun on the pitch, try to score, and create chances.”\nIs it okay for girls to look up to male footballers, or is it about time they look up to female players like Alessia Russo, Daphne van Domselaar, and Caitlin Foord and say, “I want to be like her”?\nWell, Arsenal’s Australian international, Caitlin Foord, has been speaking about what needs to happen for women in football to emerge as role models for girls.\nShe boldly claimed, “You can’t be what you can’t see.”\nFrom those words, one can’t help but hope that the women’s game continues to be embraced and that broadcasters see the value in showcasing it.\nI recently watched a clip of a girl dubbed “mini Aitana.” I believe she’s called that because of her quality, despite her young age, and her resemblance to Aitana Bonmatí on the pitch.\nI’d imagine she’ll look up to Aitana Bonmatí winning 2 Ballon d’Ors back to back and tell herself, “I want to be like Aitana.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by GIRLACTICO (@girlactico)\nIn the future, we want to hear girls speak about how some of our Gunners, like Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, Alessia Russo, Kim Little, and Emily Fox, inspired them to be the players they are.\nArsenal v man city women With the growth in the women’s game in recent years, and particularly the fan following and bums on seats at Emirates that Arsenal Women have amassed, it’s highly likely that our Gunners are already inspiring the next generation of female footballers, don’t you think?\nMichelle M\nFollow JustArsenal’s Gooner Women on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?

We've received your submission.\nBack to Reading Published July 25, 2024, 8:06 p.m. ET One of the biggest pieces that was potentially going to hit MLB’s trade market is heading to the injury list just days before the deadline.\nA’s closer Mason Miller was put on the 15-day IL with a broken left pinky on Thursday, complicating a potential trade for the hard-throwing right-hander.\nMiller, 25, fractured the finger on his non-throwing hand after putting “his hand down awkwardly” while preparing for an exercise, according to MLB.com’s Martin Gallegos .\nMason Miller has been one of the best closers in baseball this season. Getty Images\nThe closer has been utterly dominant this season, striking out 70 batters over 40 ⅔ innings with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves for Oakland.\nMiller is averaging a whopping 100.9 mph on his fastball in 2024, according to Baseball Savant, the fastest heater in the big leagues.\nA rookie this season, Miller is under club control for five more seasons and isn’t eligible to become a free agent until after the 2029 season, making him an even more appealing piece for teams looking to improve this year and beyond.\nExplore More Jerry Jones' paternity countersuit comes to stunning end Jerry Jones speaks out after 'sensitive' paternity trial reached surprising end Former ESPN star in serious talks to join Craig Carton's FS1 show A broken pinky will take Mason Miller out of action for at least a couple of weeks. Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\nEven before the injury, the A’s appeared disinclined to move their young closer, with ESPN’s Buster Onley reporting Wednesday that Miller was “out of play in the trade market” despite Oakland sitting at 41-63 and in last place in the American League West.\nEven Miller himself threw water on a potential trade out of the Bay Area recently.\n“I don’t anticipate me really heading out this year,” Miller said earlier this month . “The value I’m bringing right now to the team, I think they want to hold on to that, and I’m happy to be a part of that group.”\nA’s manager Mark Kotsay echoed the same sentiment around the All-Star Break.\n“I don’t [think Miller will be traded]. For us, where we’re trying to go, what we’re trying to do, to build something from within, he is a big part of that development. I can’t say 100 percent because I don’t make those decisions.

    "text": "A driver had to be rescued from a submerged car as Storm Gerrit battered Dumfries and Galloway on Wednesday.\nThe drama unfolded on the old military road from Lochfoot to Dumfries.\nPower was cut to dozens of homes as the storm raged.\nAnd transport was hit badly with flooding and falling trees blocking roads, while train services were disrupted. Dozens of homes were affected by power cuts and persistent heavy rain which also caused some localised flooding across the region, including the Whitesands in Dumfries.\nDumfries and Galloway Council took the step of posting a Virtual Operations Support Team (VOST) warning list of live incidents on roads and of flooding to keep the public informed.\nTrains were cancelled on Wednesday from Glasgow to Dumfries and yesterday there were no early services from Kilmarnock to Dumfries.\nBrooms Road in Dumfries was badly flooded\nA message posted on Facebook on Wednesday told how the Boathouse cafe and restaurant at Glencaple near Dumfries would be shut due to flooded access roads.\nAnd another social media post on Wednesday told how a driver had to be rescued on the old military road.\nMeanwhile, police said yesterday that cars were trapped on Glencaple Road due to warning signs being ignored.\nThe Bankend Road\nThe Met Office said that 20 to 45mm of rain was expected in 24 hours until yesterday in Scotland along with winds reaching 60 to 70mph in some areas.\nAnd according to meteorologist Geoff Monk of Laurieston, the storm was much more remarkable for rain amounts than wind speeds.\nSpeaking at 1pm on Wednesday, he said: “From 2am this morning we have had 50mm – it was absolutely throwing it down. And west of Glasgow they had 35mm in six hours.\n“It’s a really wet system but it is pushing north quite quickly. We have had the worst but that’s not to say it’s finished.”",

La resolución 448 del Ministerio de Seguridad Nacional apuntó a focalizar la intervención del Estado en el 10% de los municipios del país. Se trata de sectores que concentran el 70% de la población nacional y el 90% de los homicidios dolosos. El denominado Plan Territorial de Reducción de Homicidios y Violencia Relacionada o Plan 90/10 formó parte del esquema estratégico de seguridad lanzado por la ministra Patricia Bullrich en diciembre de 2024, que permitió alcanzar una tasa de homicidios de 3,8 cada 100.000 habitantes, la más baja en 25 años.\nLa resolución fue publicada hoy en el Boletín Oficial y fue elaborada a partir del análisis del mapa de los asesinatos en la Argentina que reveló que los homicidios están frecuentemente asociados a otras formas de violencia, como la intrafamiliar y la juvenil.\n“Estas violencias, a su vez, retroalimentan un ciclo que aumenta la probabilidad de incidentes letales, por lo que es fundamental abordar estas dinámicas para tener un impacto sostenible en la reducción de homicidios”, se consignó en la resolución.\nEntre los objetivos del plan figuran la reducción de los factores de riesgo, desarrollar políticas de prevención y fortalecer los vínculos de confianza entre las comunidades y las fuerzas de seguridad federales.\nReplicarán en varias ciudades la experiencia del uso de fuerzas federales en Rosario marcelo-manera-7533 - LA NACION",

    "title": "Tacleada estratégica: alumnas Tec colaboran para los Broncos de Denver | Tecnológico de Monterrey",
    "text": "25 estudiantes del Tecnológico de Monterrey campus Santa Fe desarrollaron planes de publicidad para los Broncos de Denver, equipo de la National Football League (NFL).\nLas y los estudiantes colaboraron con los Broncos a través de la materia: Publicidad, estrategia creativa y producción. La profesora Marcia López, coordinadora de esta clase, gestionó la alianza con el equipo de la NFL.\n“El reto de la clase era que los Broncos ampliaran su base de fans en México y en Latinoamérica a través de un plan de publicidad”, explica Marcia López, profesora de la Escuela de Humanidades y Educación.\nLas 5 alumnas con las mejores propuestas fueron invitadas a Denver para conocer las instalaciones de los Broncos y asistir a su último partido de la temporada el pasado 5 de enero del 2025.\n“Trabajar con una marca internacional nos hizo conocer nuevas estrategias y proponer ideas que en México tal vez no se han intentado. Tuvimos que pensar fuera de la caja para crear algo sorprendente”, comenta Mariana Silva, integrante del equipo ganador del reto.\nAlumnas Tec desarrollan plan de publicidad para equipo de la NFL\nLas y los estudiantes del Tec campus Santa Fe trabajaron durante un semestre, entre agosto y diciembre del 2024, buscando crear un plan de publicidad que le permita a los Broncos de Denver ampliar su base de fanáticas y fanáticos en México y Latinoamérica.\nEl equipo de Dafne Ledesma, Larizza Muñoz, Mariana Silva, Nadia Ferreira y Samantha Gómez, alumnas de séptimo semestre de la Licenciatura en Mercadotecnia, diseñó las propuestas ganadoras de este reto.\n“Diseñamos 3 propuestas. La que más llamó la atención fue la de crear un servidor en Discord para que fans de los Broncos pudieran conectar durante los partidos o a través de dinámicas durante la temporada”, explica Mariana Silva.\nDiscord es una plataforma que permite crear comunidades digitales, privadas o públicas, donde las personas pueden chatear, realizar llamadas de voz y video grupales, y compartir fotos y videos.\nLa segunda propuesta de las alumnas está enfocada en la mercadotecnia experiencial, la cual considera que las personas eligen un producto o servicio por la vivencia que se les ofrece antes de una compra y durante su consumo.\n“Propusimos implementar un evento en un cine para que fans de los Broncos fueran a ver un partido con sus amigas y amigos, conocieran más fans y así, creen un sentido de pertenencia más fuerte” añade Dafne Ledesma.\nDe acuerdo con las alumnas, uno de los desafíos a los que se enfrentaron al diseñar sus propuestas fue el de entender a su público objetivo y la pasión por el fútbol americano.\n“Conocíamos la NFL, siempre vemos el Super Bowl por el medio tiempo, pero no sabíamos tanto del deporte.\n“Nuestro público objetivo eran adolescentes hombres, entonces fue complicado entender qué querían y con base en eso, decidir qué tienen que hacer los Broncos para conectar con ellos”, menciona Larissa Muñoz.\nA pesar de no estar tan familiarizadas con el deporte, las alumnas lograron diseñar sus propuestas con ayuda de la empatía y la investigación.\n“A mí hasta me aburría el fútbol americano y con esto aprendí que vale la pena aprender de todo, hasta de lo que no te gusta, y más porque la mercadotecnia se trata de entender al público y de ofrecerle algo genuino”, asegura Samantha Gómez.\nEl equipo de mercadotecnia de los Broncos de Denver decidirá cuáles propuestas de las alumnas implementarán, de acuerdo con la profesora Marcia López.\n“La mercadotecnia se trata de entender al público y ofrecerle algo genuino\".- Samantha Gómez.\nEl impacto de colaborar con organizaciones internacionales para estudiantes Tec\nDe acuerdo con Larizza Muñoz, para las y los estudiantes del Tec siempre es emocionante enterarse con qué organización van a colaborar en sus materias y más en casos como este.\n“Había rumores de que trabajaríamos con un equipo de la NFL. Cuando nos dijeron que iba a ser con los Broncos, pensamos: ¡No puede ser, qué increíble!”, relata Larizza.\nDafne Ledesma considera que colaborar con una organización de renombre como los Broncos fue muy enriquecedor para su desarrollo profesional.\n“Trabajar con una marca tan importante como los Broncos nos permitió hacer un proyecto más profesional y un plan de publicidad mucho más extenso”, asegura Dafne.\nAparte de la experiencia profesional que les brindó el reto, las alumnas ganadoras y la profesora Marcia López fueron invitadas a Denver para conocer las instalaciones de los Broncos y asistir a su último partido de la temporada en contra de los Chiefs de Kansas City.\n“Fuimos 4 días. Nos dieron un tour privado de su estadio, conocimos las oficinas de mercadotecnia, nos dejaron ver sus verdaderos trofeos del Super Bowl y tuvimos acceso al campo antes de que iniciara el juego. Pudimos ver a todos los jugadores desde muy cerca”, cuenta Marcia López.\nLarizza Muñoz destaca al día del partido como uno de los más icónicos del viaje por la relación que tuvo esta experiencia con su proyecto.\n“El día del partido estábamos súper emocionadas, desde temprano listas con nuestros jerseys. Después de tanto estudiar al público y tratar de entenderlo, ser una fan más en el estadio fue muy lindo”, comenta Larizza.\nPor último, la profesora López asegura que existe la intención de trabajar de nuevo con los Broncos de Denver en la materia: Publicidad, estrategia creativa y producción.\nTAMBIÉN QUERRÁS LEER:\nNotas Relacionadas",

    "title": "RAY MASSEY: BMW ups the ante with 356 mile range 340hp all-electric i5 eDrive40",
    "text": "Para marcar el comienzo de 2024, he estado conduciendo la nueva berlina Serie 5 de octava generación de BMW y, específicamente, el primer modelo i5 totalmente eléctrico de gama alta.\nLos jefes de BMW dicen que este 5 ofrece la tecnología y el lujo de la limusina cumbre de la serie 7, y puedo confirmar que este es el caso.\nLos precios van desde £ 51.000 para el 520i de gasolina de 208 CV, capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 7,5 segundos y alcanzar 225 km/h. Hay dos opciones híbridas gasolina-eléctrico. En el otro extremo del espectro, el i5 M60 xDrive con tracción total de 601 caballos de fuerza que probé alcanza las 62 mph en la mitad de ese tiempo (un superdeportivo de 3,8 segundos), hasta 142 mph, y costará alrededor de £100,000.\nPero como muchos compradores serán usuarios de automóviles de empresa y negocios, las ventajas fiscales sobre los clientes privados en efectivo o con acuerdos financieros reducirán drásticamente el costo total.\nEl interior inteligente, moderno y ordenado se siente espacioso y diseñado con buen gusto.\nElectrizante: el i5 eDrive40 totalmente eléctrico de 356 millas de autonomía y 340 CV de BMW\nEs un toque de ciencia ficción, de una manera sofisticada. Es grande e imponente, pero elegante. Y la aceleración es formidable y suave.\nIncluso hay una banda sonora del compositor de Hollywood Hans Zimmer para acompañar el lanzamiento.\nTambién es el primer BMW que presenta juegos en el automóvil a través de la gran pantalla central. Los interiores Verganza sin cuero se ofrecen de serie: son los primeros BMW en el Reino Unido en hacerlo.\nEl alcance declarado del EV M60 es de entre 285 y 316 millas, según las especificaciones. Pero prepárate: todo eso cuesta £97,745. Y con más de £17,000 de ‘extras’ en mi auto, eso llevó el total a más de £115,000.\nLa iluminación interior cambia según su modo de conducción o estado de ánimo. Incluso hay una opción de arte digital. El frenado regenerativo significa que puedes conducir “con un solo pedal” sin necesidad de aplicar los frenos, al mismo tiempo que generas y almacenas carga adicional.\nEn el rango justo debajo y con prácticamente el mismo kit (aunque menos potencia) se encuentra el i5 eDrive40 totalmente eléctrico de 340 hp, desde £ 74,550 con un alcance de hasta 356 millas y 0-60 en 6 segundos. Las versiones Touring Estate se unirán a la gama en primavera.\nRealmente choqué esos cinco de celebración con el nuevo BMW i5 eléctrico, el buque insignia de la octava generación del Serie 5 desde la década de 1970.\nEl sistema de información y entretenimiento del tablero de pantalla panorámica curva y el ambiente interior me hicieron sentir como el Capitán Kirk de Star Trek al mando de la Starship Enterprise. Casi podía imaginarme al Dr. McCoy diciéndome al oído: “Es un Jim serie 5, pero no como lo conocemos”.\nPero si bien es de alta tecnología y lujoso, no es ostentoso ni ostentoso. Rezuma sofisticación. El Capitán Kirk se sentiría como en casa conduciendo esto por placer y ocio en sus días libres explorando el universo.\nSin embargo, realmente tienes que tener cuidado con el velocímetro y afinar tu pie derecho para evitar alcanzar inadvertidamente la velocidad máxima en esta veloz limusina ejecutiva de alta gama inspirada en la división Motorsport o ‘M’ de BMW. La aceleración es fenomenal.\nEs más largo (se extiende hasta 5 metros), más ancho y más alto y con una mayor distancia entre ejes y una mayor presencia en la carretera en comparación con su predecesor.\nEl interior inteligente, moderno y ordenado se siente espacioso y diseñado con buen gusto.\nLos jefes de BMW dicen que este 5 ofrece la tecnología y el lujo de la limusina cumbre de la serie 7\nEl i5 será difícil para todos, excepto para los compradores privados más adinerados.\nIdeal para las autopistas sin restricciones de Alemania. Pero ten cuidado en otros lugares.\nMás largo (se extiende hasta 5 metros), más ancho, más alto y con una mayor distancia entre ejes y una mayor presencia en la carretera en comparación con su predecesor, el nuevo 5 promete y ofrece mayor comodidad para los asientos y espacio para las piernas, especialmente en la parte trasera.\nLleva los niveles tecnológicos de la limusina insignia de la serie 7 a la serie ejecutiva 5, lo que demuestra que 7 en 5 realmente funciona.\nY vaya, ¿puedes acumular rápidamente una factura de extras opcionales?\nLos extras instalados en mi coche, que elevaron el total a más de £115.000, incluyeron: £1.750 para el estilo exterior M Carbon; £ 3300 por un paquete de tecnología plus que incluye pantalla frontal; y un paquete Comfort Plus que agrega asientos delanteros y traseros con calefacción, asientos delanteros ventilados de comodidad adicional y bellamente diseñados, y una tapa del maletero eléctrica.\nMi propia experiencia de conducción se produce cuando las últimas cifras muestran que uno de cada cuatro BMW vendidos en el Reino Unido el año pasado fue totalmente eléctrico. Y eso sólo puede acelerar,\nBMW Group UK informó 28.723 matriculaciones de vehículos totalmente eléctricos en 2023, un aumento del 34 por ciento con respecto a 2022, y representa una cuarta parte del total de 111.734 ventas.\nEn el sector empresarial la proporción es aún mayor: la mitad de todas las matriculaciones son vehículos totalmente eléctricos (BEV).\nComo indiqué anteriormente, el i5 será difícil para todos, excepto para los compradores privados más adinerados. Pero para los ejecutivos que adquieren uno como vehículo de empresa y se benefician de generosos beneficios fiscales, es una opción mucho más inteligente desde el punto de vista económico.\nAsí que, a riesgo de corregir el infinitivo dividido más famoso de la historia de la radiodifusión, de la propia Star Trek, permítanme concluir: el i5 es realmente un coche eléctrico en el que ir con valentía.\n¿Cabrá en mi garaje? BMW i5 M60 xDrive berlina\nPrecio base: £97,745 Precio según lo conducido con extras: £115,244 Gama de 5 series con precios desde: £ 51.000 (para 520i gasolina)\nLongitud: 5.060 mm Ancho: 1.900 mm Ancho (incluye espejos): 2.156 mm Altura: 1.505 mm Asientos: 5 Peso en vacío: 2.380 kg\nTransmisión: Automático Propulsión: Eléctrico – a partir de 2 motores eléctricos Conducir: todas las ruedas motrices Fuerza: 601 CV Emisiones: Cero\n0-62 mph: 3,8 segundos\nRango: 284,6 a 315,7 millas (según las ruedas y las especificaciones)\nConsumo de energía (kW por 62 millas/10 km): 18,4 a 20,5\nVolumen de equipaje: 490 litros\nTiempos de carga: Caja de pared trifásica de 22 kW hora – 4,25 horas; Cargador rápido de 11 kW: 8,25 horas; Cargador rápido CC al 80 por ciento: 30 minutos\nRango adicional de impulso de CC de 10 minutos: 156 millas\nMolestia por coche abandonado\nMás de 53.000 coches abandonados fueron abandonados a la vuelta de la esquina el año pasado, según revelan nuevos datos sobre libertad de información obtenidos por el especialista Scrap Car Comparison (scrapcarcomparison.co.uk).\nY cualquiera que haya experimentado los problemas que esto causa, como me pasó a mí durante casi un año, con los ayuntamientos y la policía reacios a actuar, sabe lo exasperante que puede ser.\nProblemas: más de 53.000 coches abandonados fueron abandonados a la vuelta de la esquina el año pasado\nFuera de Londres, la capital de los automóviles abandonados en el Reino Unido es Coventry, que alguna vez fue la principal ciudad fabricante de automóviles de Gran Bretaña, con 1.898, seguida por Brighton & Hove (1.889), Leicester (1.765) y Manchester (1.664).\nLos ayuntamientos de Londres representaron más de 29.500 del total de 53.794 coches abandonados, y Bromley encabezó la lista con 2.239 en el año hasta septiembre de 2023.\nEn Escocia, las cifras más altas se registraron en Edimburgo (1.087) y Glasgow (1.043).\nEl informe también revela que enero de 2023 fue el mes en el que se registró el mayor número total de vehículos abandonados en el año en todo el país: un total de 3.666.\nEl informe señala: “Esto podría deberse a una variedad de factores, como un aumento en el robo oportunista de automóviles y el uso de vehículos mientras la gente estaba en celebraciones festivas, o a personas que optan por abandonar un motor viejo y costoso a medida que los bolsillos se aprietan en los meses de invierno”. .’\nSin embargo, los expertos añaden también que algunos concesionarios de coches ‘informales’ también utilizan la vía pública para aparcar sus vehículos no vendidos.\nTambién se roban algunos coches abandonados.\nDavid Kottaun, director de operaciones de Scrap Car Comparison, afirmó: “Cuando un coche se vuelve demasiado difícil de utilizar o mantener, algunas personas pueden simplemente optar por abandonarlo.\n«Los vehículos abandonados pueden crear problemas de acceso si el coche bloquea una entrada, un camino o incluso una carretera, además de correr el riesgo de dañar el entorno en el que se encuentran abandonados debido a fugas de fluidos peligrosos. También exige los recursos de los ayuntamientos que investigan y retiran el vehículo.\n“Aunque a veces un vehículo puede ser abandonado debido a delitos como el robo, en la mayoría de los casos, cuando alguien ha decidido abandonar su vehículo, potencialmente está perdiendo la oportunidad de ganar dinero al desguazarlo.\n“Si un automóvil es demasiado viejo para conducirlo o no se puede reparar, aún podría ofrecerle valor a través del valor de chatarra, por lo que nunca es una buena idea simplemente abandonar un vehículo”.\nSitio web: https://www.scrapcarcomparison.co.uk/blog/scrap-car-report-statistics/\nLa falta de puntos de recarga podría afectar las ventas\nEl incumplimiento del gobierno de sus objetivos en materia de puntos de carga públicos corre el riesgo de frenar las ya lentas ventas de automóviles eléctricos, dicen los concesionarios de automóviles.\nSin embargo, los precios de los autos eléctricos nuevos podrían caer a medida que la ley obliga a los fabricantes a producir un porcentaje cada vez mayor de vehículos eléctricos, y es probable que algunos se vendan con pérdidas.\nUna gran afluencia de vehículos chinos nuevos y más baratos también aumentará la presión a la baja sobre los precios, dice el editor de Auto Express, Steve Fowler.\nAfluencia: los precios de los coches eléctricos nuevos podrían caer, ya que la ley obliga a los fabricantes a producir un porcentaje cada vez mayor de vehículos eléctricos.\nLas predicciones siguen al anuncio del RAC de que el Gobierno no había cumplido su objetivo de carga de vehículos eléctricos de alta potencia para servicios de autopistas en 2023.\nLa encuesta de la NFDA sobre concesionarios de automóviles mostró que casi seis de cada diez encuestados que no estaban interesados en comprar un vehículo eléctrico lo atribuían a la falta de instalaciones de carga en el Reino Unido.\nAlgunos enlaces de este artículo pueden ser enlaces de afiliados.
