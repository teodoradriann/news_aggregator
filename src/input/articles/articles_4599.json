    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Transcribing content is an emerging opportunity that freelancers of all kinds might want to consider. If you’ve been wondering\nhow to make money transcribing, then companies like Rev, Scribie, and TranscribeMe offer jobs for beginners to get started in the transcription world. SpeakWrite, GoTranscript, and Audio Transcription Center are additional reputable companies that offer well-paying transcription opportunities.\nWe’ll go over seven audio transcription jobs as well as their average pay rates, benefits, and more.\n[Key takeaways](#key-takeaways) [The 7 best transcription sites that pay](#the-7-best-transcription-sites-that-pay) [1. Rev](#1-rev) [2. Scribie](#2-scribie) [3. SpeakWrite](#3-speakwrite) [4. TranscribeMe](#4-transcribeme) [5. GoTranscript](#5-gotranscript) [6. Audio Transcription Center](#6-audio-transcription-center) [7. Fiverr](#7-fiverr) [What’s required to be a transcriptionist?](#what’s-required-to-be-a-transcriptionist) [How to choose the best transcription jobs](#how-to-choose-the-best-transcription-jobs) [FAQs](#faqs) [Best transcription sites that pay: bottom line](#best-transcription-sites-that-pay-bottom-line) [Methodology](#methodology)\nKey takeaways\n- Transcriptionists convert spoken language into written text for various industries, including healthcare, law, media, and academia.\n- Typists must be comfortable with using a blend of artificial intelligence (AI) and human editing to transcribe audio. Many companies use both.\n- Rev has one of the largest catalogs of freelancers, with an average pay rate of $156 per month.\n- Audio Transcription Center and TranscribeMe both pay about $15 to $20 per audio hour, which makes them relatively high-paying options.\n- Fiverr helps freelancers of all kinds list their services for hire — including transcriptionists.\nThe 7 best transcription sites that pay\n1. Rev\nRev is a popular global transcription service that was created primarily as a remote working option, focusing on speech-to-text services. The company’s team of freelancers offers audio transcription, video captions, subtitles, and live captions for Zoom.\nIt has a network of over 72,000 freelancers that use speech recognition AI to quickly and accurately transcribe a variety of programs. However, freelancers shouldn’t rely on Rev to make a full-time living, as the average freelancer makes just $156 in monthly earnings.\n2. Scribie\nScribie employs a network of over 50,000 freelancers. The company provides a remote work option and helpful AI tools to make transcribing each audio clip as easy as possible.\nOn average, Scribie freelancers make $5 to $20 per audio hour. How much you earn depends on your skill level and how many scripts you get through. Luckily, most audio files are only about six minutes long, which makes it easy to complete many transcriptions in a short amount of time.\n3. SpeakWrite\nSpeakWrite focuses on insurance, business, and legal transcription jobs. Freelancers must meet a short list of requirements to get started, including typing 60 words per minute with very few errors. You must also provide your own equipment, and previous transcription experience is a plus.\nSince SpeakWrite promises clients three-hour turnaround times for certain work, expect to have short deadlines for your work. That said, you can choose your own schedule, and the options are flexible, as SpeakWrite operates 24/7. Typists earn one half cent per word, and some shifts offer a 10% bonus.\n4. TranscribeMe\nLike many transcription companies, TranscribeMe prioritizes remote transcription work and a flexible schedule you can design yourself. TranscribeMe offers customers AI-powered and typist-checked transcriptions and translations.\nStarting typists make anywhere from $15 to $22 per hour at TranscribeMe. Most typists don’t earn a full-time wage, averaging just $250 each month in income. For those who stick with the company, there are opportunities for advancement. Members of these special teams earn $60 to $70+ per audio hour.\n5. GoTranscript\nGoTranscript is one of the largest transcription sites in the world, offering English, Spanish, German, and French translations. The company frequently has openings on its careers page, particularly for Spanish translators.\nGoTranscript offers slightly more competitive pay, with top earners bringing in $1,215 per month. Average typists and translators don’t earn a ton, however. Freelance transcriptionists can expect to earn $150 per month on average with GoTranscript.\n6. Audio Transcription Center\nAudio Transcription Center provides transcription services for academic institutions, government agencies, historians, financial organizations, and archival organizations. The company has offered these services since 1966, making it a well-established organization. In keeping with its strong commitment to accuracy, typists must take a transcription test and type at least 80 words per minute with 98% accuracy.\nAlthough the Audio Transcription Center has a higher standard for its transcriptionists than most, its pay is actually slightly lower, running from $15 to $18 per hour. That said, beginners can start their transcribing career with Audio Transcription Center, as no prior experience is necessary to apply.\n7. Fiverr\nFiverr isn’t a transcription-specific site, but freelancers of all kinds can list their services on its platform. When Fiverr began, most services cost customers just $5, but freelancers set their own prices now.\nUnlike other companies on this list, you’re responsible for the business side of the equation as well as providing the transcription services. You must create and manage your listings and pricing and attract a regular clientele to earn consistent income.\nWhat’s required to be a transcriptionist?\nBecoming a transcriptionist is an attainable side hustle option for most people who have a computer to work from and a reliable internet connection, as well as some other skills companies look for in typists and translators.\nWhether you're aiming to dive into the world of general, medical, legal, or language transcription, the following are the fundamental requirements to excel in the field:\n- Fast typing speed and accuracy: A proficient transcriptionist must have a strong command of keyboard skills. Most companies require a minimum typing speed of 60 words per minute and a high accuracy rate.\n- Attention to detail: You should be able to maintain focus for extended periods and stay consistent in speed and accuracy to produce error-free transcripts.\n- Bilingual abilities: Many transcription companies appreciate freelancers with the ability to speak English and other languages like Spanish or French.\n- Strong grammar skills: A strong command of the language being transcribed, including its grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary, is necessary for producing accurate written content.\n- Excellent listening skills: A transcriptionist must be able to translate spoken words into written words quickly and accurately, even in cases of poor audio quality or background noise.\n- Reliable technology: A reliable computer and a high-quality headset or headphones are essential to ensure optimal audio clarity and a seamless transcription process.\n- Research abilities: Thorough research skills and the capability to fact-check are necessary, particularly when transcribing technical or specialized content such as legal or medical documents.\n- Stellar time management and organizational skills: Effective time management and organizational abilities are essential to meet deadlines and manage multiple projects simultaneously.\nHow to choose the best transcription jobs\nIf you’re considering becoming a transcriptionist, you may be surprised to see how many companies offer this as a side hustle. To narrow down the best option for your schedule and payment preferences, think through the following:\n- Consider your interests and expertise: Look for transcription opportunities that align with your interests or areas you specialize in. Areas such as legal and medical transcription can leverage your existing knowledge and skills, which may lead to more fulfilling and lucrative opportunities.\n- Look at the payment structure and rates: Most audio transcription jobs pay pennies per word, but the more assignments you can take on, the more money you can make. Compare the compensation structures, such as pay-per-audio-minute, pay-per-word, or hourly rates, to make sure you choose a service with competitive pay.\n- Consider the flexibility offered: Balancing your side hustle with other commitments is easier when you have the freedom to adjust your side-hustle schedule. Work with companies that give you full choice over when you work.\n- Read reviews: Research the reputation of transcription companies by exploring online reviews, testimonials, and feedback from other transcriptionists. Choose clients with a positive track record of timely payments and clear communication since they tend to have a more stable work environment.\n- Assess the technology requirements: Ensure that the audio transcription jobs you choose fit within your technical capabilities and equipment. Does the company require a Mac? PC? A headset? A foot pedal? Make sure you’re comfortable providing these things on your own.\nFAQs\nHow do you get into audio transcribing?\nPeople with a working computer and internet connection can enter into the audio transcribing business. It takes strong typing and listening skills, but those willing to learn can find sites willing to work with them. To get started, consider taking general transcription courses and crafting a professional resume.\nHow much do audio transcribers make?\nMost audio transcribers make anywhere from a hundred dollars to a couple of thousand dollars each month. For the most part, $15 to $25 per hour is the common pay range.\nWhat transcribing site pays the most?\nTranscribeMe’s highest-paid transcribers make $60 to $70 per hour, which is one of the higher rates in the industry. Generally, the more you transcribe and the longer you stay with a company, the higher your rates will be.\nHow long does it take to transcribe one hour of audio?\nHow long it takes to transcribe one hour of audio varies from person to person. Generally, the average transcriptionist takes four hours to transcribe an hour-long audio file. However, this timeframe can significantly increase for challenging audio with accents, technical terminology, or background noise.\nBest transcription sites that pay: bottom line\nFor certain freelancers, transcription jobs can be one of the\nbest side hustles, offering the convenience of working from home and the ability to manage your own schedule. But you should know that the earning potential in this field is often limited, especially for beginners. Despite this, getting into the industry as a novice is relatively straightforward. You just need typing skills, your own equipment, and a willingness to familiarize yourself with transcription software.\nFor experienced transcribers looking to maximize profits, TranscribeMe and GoTranscript pay a premium. Those looking for the most flexibility should consider SpeakWrite and Rev, which are entirely remote and operate 24/7. Alternatively, you can consider\nfreelance jobs for typists.\nMethodology\nThe companies we chose for our best transcription job sites may be current or past FinanceBuzz partners.

    "title": "Hawaii Democrats Advance Legislation Attempting To Remove Donald Trump From Ballot",
    "text": "Hawaii Democrats have advanced legislation that could remove Donald Trump from the state’s ballot. The bill, introduced by Hawaii state Sen. Karl Rhoads, aims to “specify that election ballots issued by the chief election officer or county clerk shall exclude any candidate who is disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; article XVI, section 3 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii; or another constitutional or statutory provision.” Although the bill doesn’t explicitly name Donald Trump, the proposed legislation would aim to “prohibit electors of presidential and vice presidential candidates from voting for any presidential or vice presidential nominee who has been disqualified pursuant to Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as determined by any federal court, or as determined by the state supreme court in an election contest.” “Maine’s Democratic Secretary of State and Colorado’s Supreme Court cited the insurrection clause in barring Trump from their state ballots,” Fox News noted. Hawaii Democrat introduces bill to ban Trump from ballot [https://t.co/xRbNU8eSS4] — Fox News (@FoxNews) [January 24, 2024] [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawaii-democrat-introduces-bill-ban-trump-ballot?intcmp=tw_fnc) reports: The bill passed its first reading on Monday. Trump’s campaign has repeatedly categorized efforts to block him from the ballot as aiming to disenfranchise American voters. Maine’s Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, appealed a judge’s ruling on Friday that put on hold her decision to remove Trump from the ballot until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a similar case in Colorado. Bellow, a Democrat, said she also wants to ensure Maine’s highest court has the opportunity to weigh in before ballots are counted in the March 5 primaries. The timelines are tight as Super Tuesday approaches. The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in the Colorado case on Feb. 8, which likely means there would not be enough time to meet statutory deadlines for Bellows to reissue a ruling on Trump’s ballot status and for additional appeals to be filed before Election Day. Lawsuits in Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona and Oregon aiming to block Trump from the 2024 ballot have already been dismissed on procedural grounds, Newsweek reported. Journalist Nick Sortor questioned the motives of Hawaii Democrats wanting Trump removed from the ballot. “Hawaii Democrats have introduced legislation to keep President Trump OFF the ballot for the 2024 election. Are they afraid Hawaii is going to FLIP from blue to RED after Biden ABANDONED the people of Maui after the fires? Or maybe they’re afraid Trump will expose the RAMPANT corruption out here in Hawaii?” Sortor wrote. 🚨 JUST IN: Hawaii Democrats have introduced legislation to keep President Trump OFF the ballot for the 2024 election Are they afraid Hawaii is going to FLIP from blue to RED after Biden ABANDONED the people of Maui after the fires?

He has been kicked off ballots in Maine and Colorado, because of the same constitutional amendment. But the decisions in both of those states were paused on appeal. The US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the Colorado case in early February.",

    "text": "Students Compete To Design Earthquake-Safe, Sustainable Housing This week, 30 of Aotearoa New Zealand’s top architecture, engineering and construction students competed to design an affordable and sustainable housing development in the heart of Ōtautahi Christchurch. The winners of this year’s ArchEngBuild challenge were announced by Minister for Building and Construction Hon Chris Penk at a prizegiving at Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetū last night (Thursday). The winners are Ella Knapton, architecture student at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington; Francis Orendain, construction management at Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki, and Douglas Goncalves, structural engineering at The University of Auckland. The judges commended the sheer complexity of the work: “They had 48 hours to work together to come up with an incredibly well-resolved concept and a depth of knowledge that was really impressive.” Overall, the judges were impressed with the students’ optimism and creativity in solving some of today’s biggest challenges – including resilience, sustainability and affordability in New Zealand buildings. “The students we saw today are going to change the building industry. Our industry can be tough – but these students are hitting the real world with the right attitude and focus on collaboration and communication,” said the judges. Minister for Building and Construction Hon Chris Penk said: “New Zealand’s housing needs to be affordable, and it needs to be resilient. We have some of the most unaffordable housing in the world, with over a quarter of renters spending more than 40 per cent of their income on housing. This is hurting New Zealanders and it’s hurting the economy. “Finding more efficient ways to build houses that are affordable, but also warm, durable, and safe from natural hazard should be the key motivators for the building and construction industry.” he says. “These students are the future of the industry,” ArchEngBuild is run by the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ) and Concrete New Zealand. Claire Falck, CEO of BRANZ, says collaboration is the heart of the ArchEngBuild competition. “Every year we challenge these architecture, engineering and construction students to work together, to help drive collaboration in the industry. It’s amazing what they come up with and how they work together,” she says. “At BRANZ, we work to encourage collaboration across the building and construction industry to find solutions to challenges around housing. ArchEngBuild gives people the opportunity to work together and understand each other at the beginning of their career and take those skills into the industry.” The ArchEngBuild Challenge is in its 11th year. Past ArchEngBuild students have described the challenge as one of the best experiences of their studies and the only chance they had to understand how to work with other architects, engineers and construction managers in multidisciplinary teams. The judges were: - Cass Goodwin, Regional Manager at Batchelar McDougall Consulting Ltd - James Woods, Managing Director at Image Construction & Image Projects - Victoria Threadwell, Senior Building Scientist at Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment - Bernadette Muir, NZIA Fellow and Principal Academic Staff Member at Ara Institute of Canterbury ArchEngBuild 2024 is sponsored by Concrete NZ, Metals New Zealand, WIDE, New Zealand Timber Design Society, and Southbase. It is supported by Te Kāhui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects, Te Ao Rangahau Engineering New Zealand and the New Zealand Institute of Building. ArchEngBuild took place from Tuesday 2 July - Thursday 4 July at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha University of Canterbury.",

    "title": "Al menos 834 pacientes psiquiátricos fueron atados el pasado año en Euskadi",
    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nEdición\nAl menos 834 pacientes psiquiátricos tuvieron que ser sometidos a una sujeción el pasado año en Euskadi. El tiempo medio que permanecieron con su capacidad ... de movimiento limitada fue de 3,7 días, aunque hubo casos de enfermos que permanecieron atados hasta 18 jornadas. Así se recoge en la documentación remitida por el Departamento de Salud al Parlamento vasco. En este informe se incluyen datos de las unidades psiquiátricas en los hospitales de agudos de Osakidetza y de las redes de salud mental de Bizkaia y de Álava. También figuran datos de los centros especializados con los que Salud tiene concertada esta prestación sanitaria, en especial en Gipuzkoa. Aunque en algunos casos no se incluye información sobre el número total de pacientes que tuvieron que ser sometidos a una contención física. De ahí que la cifra final de enfermos psiquiátricos a los que se tuvo que inmovilizar en 2024 en Euskadi pueda ser superior a los 834.\nOsakidetza publicó en junio la última edición sobre las recomendaciones para la prevención y reducción del uso de contenciones en adultos. En ella se establece que esta medida debe emplearse «de forma excepcional, con la mínima intensidad posible, la duración estrictamente necesaria y se debe llevar a cabo respetando los derechos de la persona y su privacidad, con un trato digno y tras utilizar todas las técnicas y medios alternativos» con anterioridad.\nPese a ello el pasado año se empleó en 1.920 ocasiones en los, al menos, los 834 enfermos psiquiátricos citados. El Departamento de Salud especifica que «un mismo paciente ha podido ser contabilizado en más de una ocasión, por traslado entre hospitales o entre unidades de un mismo centro». Este informe ha sido remitida por la consejería a la Cámara vasca a petición de Rebeka Ubera, parlamentaria de EH Bildu.\nEn la respuesta se recoge que de todos estos pacientes 48 fueron sometidos a sujeción en las unidades de psiquiatría infanto-juvenil que Osakidetza tiene en los hospitales de Basurto, Donostia y Santiago. Se trata de equipos que tratan a menores de edad.\nExisten medidas de contención tanto farmacológicas como mecánicas. Entre las segundas se encuentran las barras laterales (para evitar caídas de la cama), cinturones abdominales y pélvicos, chalecos, muñequeras y tobilleras. También, según figura en la guía de Osakidetza, se han desarrollado dispositivos textiles, como ropas o sábanas ajustables a la cama con velcro o cremalleras que solo dejan libre una o varias partes del cuerpo\nEntre los factores de riesgo que predisponen a emplear sujeciones se encuentran la edad avanzada, los cambios cognitivos provocados por delirios y demencias, los antecedentes de caídas o la dependencia creciente. Entre los motivos por los que se inmovilizó en 2024 a enfermos ingresados en centros psiquiátricos se encuentran descompensaciones psíquicas, estados de agitación con agresiones a sanitarios o a otros pacientes y autolesiones.\nLos protocolos de Salud establecen que «siempre que no quede más remedio que realizar una contención, ésta deberá ser extremando las precauciones y medidas de seguridad, con una vigilancia y monitorización de la persona para evitar el riesgo de aparición de eventos adversos».\nPero antes de llegar a atar al paciente se trata de agotar otras alternativas terapéuticas. Los propios especialistas pueden fijar de antemano con los enfermos qué medidas preventivas adoptar cuando comienzan a mostrar signos de estrés previo a una crisis mental. Entre ellas se encuentra escuchar música, hablar con familiares, pasear, leer, abrazar un peluche o tomar medicación, entre otras, para evitar perder el control y tener que ser sometido a una sujeción.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?

    "text": "Full list of police-recorded antisemitic and Islamophobic offences, by force\nThe figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests.\nHere is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021.\nThe figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK.\nThe data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change.\nAll figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents.\nSystems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nSome forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate.\nNot all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end.\n– Avon & Somerset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nThe force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed.\n– Bedfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\n– British Transport Police\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22\n– Cambridgeshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime.\n– Dorset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1\n– Durham\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam.\n– Gloucestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”.\n– Greater Manchester\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34\nThe force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish.

Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion.\n– Gwent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nThe force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries.\n– Hampshire & Isle of Wight\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4\n– Hertfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record.\n– Humberside\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2\n– Kent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6\nThe force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached.
