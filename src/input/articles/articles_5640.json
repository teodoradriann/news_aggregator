    "title": "B.C. civil lawsuit against Sex Pistols guitarist alleges 1980 sexual assault",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — A Vancouver woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. and punk rocker Stephen Jones of The Sex Pistols alleging he sexually assaulted her as a teenager while she was a movie extra more than 40 years ago.\nA B.C. Supreme Court statement of claim filed by the plaintiff says she was 14 years old and working on the movie \"Ladies & Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains\" when Jones supplied her with marijuana, then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room.\nThe court has placed a publication ban on the woman's name.\nHer lawyer Jason Gratl said in an interview that he could not comment about why the lawsuit was brought 44 years after the alleged events.\n\"I only wanted to say one thing and it's that she kept a diary,\" Gratl said.\nThe notice of claim filed Wednesday says Paramount didn't take adequate steps to warn minors or their parents about the risks of working on the set with Jonesor impose contractual terms restricting his contact with young extras or using illicit drugs.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court.\nParamount did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones could not be reached for comment.\nNeither Paramount, nor Jones have filed a statement of defence.\nThe lawsuit says Paramount hired Jones, who was 24 at the time, for a role in the film because of his reputation as a \"punk rocker\" who consumed excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and engaged in sexual misconduct, including with underage girls.\n\"The defendant Paramount was banking on the defendant Jones’ reputation and history to market 'The Fabulous Stains,'\" the statement says, adding the company \"also hired other well-known punk rock musicians as actors for the same purpose.\"\nThe statement says that despite this knowledge, the company did not take steps to protect young workers.\nThe movie, about disaffected teens in a punk rock band, was released in 1982.\nThe legal action says the woman is seeking damages, claiming the alleged assault \"caused her to suffer psychological injury, including loss of self-esteem, loss of self-worth, injurious self-imaging and identity, and loss of trust in intimacy and potential partners.\"\nThe lawsuit says she was hired as one of the hundreds of extras playing fans for the all-girl feminist rock band. Jones had been hired to play the role of a \"socially volatile punk rock guitar player in a fictitious all-male band, The Looters.\"\nIt says that on April 13, 1980, the teen went to the Denman Inn, \"a location under the direction and control\" of Paramount, with the intention of inviting the movie's lead actor, Diane Lane, to go roller skating.\nWhen she entered the lobby, it says Jones approached her, told her he had Lane's number in his hotel room and asked her to go with him to get it. Once they were inside his room, it says Jones gave her marijuana, and he then turned off the lights and closed the curtains.\nThe document says she understood that meant he was likely to make sexual advances, she told Jones she did not consent and was \"only 14, 1-4.\" It says despite this, he pulled her onto his bed, climbed on top of her then kissed and molested her.\n\"The plaintiff repeatedly and expressly told the defendant Jones 'no' and tried to move his hand away, and finally wriggled free from him and left the room,\" the notice of claim says.\nThe lawsuit says she was initially \"both repulsed and flattered by this unwanted sexual attention from someone she believed to be a rock star and movie star.\"\nBecause she was confused by what had happened, the document says she did not tell her parents and it wasn't until she was older that she \"felt sexually violated and sexually ashamed and angry\" about the alleged assault.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "ASU launches groundbreaking partnership to address water insecurity in Arizona\nFor the past two years, Arizona has contended with record-breaking heat and over 1,000 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County alone. However, the county is just a microcosm of the rest of the state, where it is estimated that thousands of households go without reliable water access each day.\nA team spearheaded by Amber Wutich, President’s Professor in Arizona State University's School of Human Evolution and Social Change and director of the school’s Center for Global Health, is making strides to support water-insecure communities and households.\n“The media keeps insisting that Phoenix is the most unsustainable city in the U.S., but the reality is that, at ASU, we’re leading the way in developing innovative engineering and social infrastructures to help humans survive and thrive in the face of water scarcity, excess heat and other climate stressors,” Wutich said.\nUnder the banner of Arizona Water for All (AW4A), Wutich and her team are combining social infrastructure with physical infrastructure and creating community partnerships to address water insecurity in Arizona. AW4A is one of the five pillars of the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative (AWII), a $40 million, multiyear partnership with the state of Arizona led by the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory in collaboration with the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering.\nInitially formed to advance water security in communities along the U.S.-Mexico border, Wutich’s pillar of AWII has expanded to design innovative approaches to holistically address water insecurity across Arizona.\nIn November, Wutich and AW4A announced two new first-of-their-king partnerships with Northern Arizona University (NAU) and the University of Arizona (U of A) that will support water-insecure communities across the state.\n“When we work with the University of Arizona, we can partner with border communities in Arizona’s Sonoran desert. And when we work with Northern University Arizona, we can partner with Navajo, Hopi and other Indigenous nations in the high desert mountains,” Wutich explained.\nThe growing AW4A network is a first of its kind in Arizona, bringing together communities across the state to address water insecurity at a broad level.\nNAU partnerships to address diverse experiences of water insecurity\nLucero Radonic, an associate professor at NAU’s Department of Anthropology and School of Earth and Sustainability, will be leading research in Coconino County at the Water, Society and Policy Lab.\nHer goal is to continue to train the next generation of researchers on how to engage with diverse community actors and institutions for the advancement of water security.\n“In the lab, we think about water security, both at the household level — do you have enough reliable quality water to drink? — and at the landscape level — do we actually have healthy river systems and water-conscious land-use planning?” Radonic explained.\nShe is currently working to identify trends in experiences of water hauling in rural, unincorporated communities, which she described as a “widely unexplored area.” Radonic is looking to establish new partnerships under AW4A to collaborate with water experts asking similar questions, particularly on Navajo and Hopi tribal lands. Her research will also support Wutich’s research in communities along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n“I think it's important to recognize that the experiences around water hauling here are super diverse. Even within the Coconino Plateau where we are located,” Radonic said. “The reasons behind different groups’ water-hauling experiences are equally diverse and always tied to histories of land and water development.”\nAccording to Radonic, one of the most important components of the AW4A partnership is bringing the issue of water security to a broader audience.\n“I don’t think many people know that water access and insecurity can take so many different shapes. To me, creating awareness is very important,” Radonic said.\nU of A to use storytelling to research water injustice in southern Arizona\nFor southern Arizonans, water security is an ever-present discussion, according to Megan Carney, the director of the U of A’s Center for Regional Food Studies.\n“Living in the desert, in an arid climate, and with the future of water feeling precarious makes water a very precious resource. With the state of Arizona producing many different agricultural commodities that are really water intensive, people are constantly worrying about water access, long-term availability and the cost of water, which is increasing,” Carney said.\nThe U of A’s partnership with AW4A will enable Carney to continue her community-based collaborative research into perceptions of food and water insecurity in Arizona’s Sonoran Desert. With a well-known lack of infrastructure and access to services throughout much of Arizona’s borderlands, Carney hopes her research will result in increased local participation in water-related decision-making.\n“We will be hosting a series of community dialogues with residents to convene folks around questions of water insecurity, how they experience it in their daily lives, how they navigate it, the ways that we might be able to increase both their knowledge of, and participation in, decision-making around water and other resources in this part of the state,” Carney said.\nShe will also dedicate resources to the Future of Food and Social Justice Youth Storytelling Project, which engages yearly undergraduate cohorts in environmental storytelling through various mediums. The program is a device to empower students from historically underrepresented communities to share their experiences in an effort to shape the environmental future of their communities.\n“What our lab aims to do is uplift the knowledge that youth bring with them from various aspects of their lives and help them cultivate their unique voices. We want them to get their stories out into the world so that they can help imagine and shape their futures around questions of environmental justice,” Carney said.\nDuring Carney’s partnership with AW4A, lab participants will focus on water and justice.\n“Partnering with our sister universities, Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona, is essential because it helps us bring the strengths of working with different peoples and ecologies,” Wutich said. “It’s an honor to work together across our beautiful, diverse state to improve people’s water and lives.”\nSDG 06 Clean Water and Sanitation\nSDG 09 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure\nSDG 10 Reduced Inequalities\nSDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities\nSDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production\nStaff\nWater\nWater futures\nWater Management\nFaculty\nTempe campus\nEnvironment and sustainability\nhttps://news.asu.edu/college-unit/school-human-evolution-and-social-change\nCommunity\nThe College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\nMore Environment and sustainability\nThere's a rattlesnake in your backyard: What do you do?\nA snake slithers onto your back porch one sunny morning.What do you do?Call a relocation expert, grab a shovel and try to kill the reptile, or do nothing?That moral quandary is at the center of…\nPettinger to guide Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine's sustainable technologies to market\nThere’s a lot of daylight between coming up with a good idea and turning that idea into something people can use.Katie Pettinger is here to help bridge that considerable gap.

    "text": "Apuntando al fallo del tribunal chavista que ratificó la victoria de Maduro, el Mandatario dijo que “no hay duda que estamos frente a una dictadura que falsea elecciones y reprime al que piensa distinto”. Cancillería reiteró que la postura de Chile sigue siendo “no reconocer el supuesto triunfo”.\nResumen Síntesis generada con OpenAI El presidente Gabriel Boric criticó duramente el fallo del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (TSJ) de Venezuela, que ratificó la victoria de Nicolás Maduro en las elecciones presidenciales del 28 de julio, calificándolo como una “consolidación del fraude”. Boric denunció el régimen de Maduro como una dictadura que falsea elecciones y reprime la disidencia. El canciller Alberto van Klaveren y Boric confirmaron que Chile no reconoce el resultado, sumándose a un llamado internacional para la publicación de todas las actas y una revisión imparcial. Desarrollado por El Mostrador Endureciendo el tono sobre la situación en Venezuela, el Presidente Gabriel Boric afirmó que el fallo del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (TSJ) del país caribeño —acusado de servir al chavismo gobernante— que ratificó este jueves la victoria de Nicolás Maduro, “termina de consolidar el fraude” en las cuestionadas elecciones presidenciales del 28 de julio.\n“El régimen de Maduro obviamente acoge con entusiasmo su sentencia que estará signada por la infamia. No hay duda que estamos frente a una dictadura que falsea elecciones, reprime al que piensa distinto y es indiferente ante el exilio más grande del mundo solo comparable con el de Siria producto de una guerra”, apuntó el Mandatario a través de la red social X.\nTambién te puede interesar: Tribunal Supremo de Venezuela ratifica cuestionada victoria electoral de Maduro Protesta global contra Maduro se desarrolla en 16 ciudades de Chile y 350 del mundo “He visto a los ojos a miles de venezolanos que claman democracia su patria y que hoy reciben un nuevo portazo. Chile no reconoce este falso triunfo autoproclamado de Maduro y compañía. Seguro por nuestra postura recibiremos (como es costumbre) insultos por parte de sus autoridades. No saben que como decía Huidobro ‘el adjetivo cuando no da vida, mata’, y ellos han asesinado la palabra democracia”, subrayó.\nGabriel Boric recalcó que “la dictadura de Venezuela no es la izquierda”. A su juicio, “es posible y necesaria una izquierda continental profundamente democrática y que respete los derechos humanos sin importar el color de quien los vulnere. Un progresismo transformador que mejore las condiciones de vida de su pueblo, construyendo comunidad en vez de individualismo, encuentro por sobre polarización. Hacia allá caminamos en Chile”.\nEn paralelo, el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Alberto van Klaveren, dijo que la decisión del TSJ no le sorprende, “como corresponde a un régimen autoritario”. Desde La Moneda, el canciller enfatizó que el anuncio “no modifica en lo más mínimo nuestra posición”.\n“Nosotros no reconocemos el resultado anunciado por el Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE) y nuestra posición es simplemente no reconocer el supuesto triunfo de Nicolás Maduro”, manifestó el ministro van Klaveren.\nEl canciller resaltó que Chile se sumó al llamado de veintidós países de América, Europa y África, además de la Unión Europea, que solicitaron la “inmediata publicación de todas las actas originales” y la verificación “imparcial e independiente” de los resultados.\nLa validación del resultado por parte del TSJ fue ampliamente cuestionada por la oposición venezolana, en particular por el abanderado de la principal coalición opositora Edmundo González Urrutia, quien señaló que “ninguna sentencia sustituirá la soberanía popular”. Varios partidos antichavistas se sumaron a la crítica y advirtieron que la decisión judicial sobre las presidenciales “auspicia la persecución política” en el país.\nDesde las elecciones del pasado 28 de julio en Venezuela, el Presidente Boric ha enfatizado la necesidad de conocer la totalidad de las actas electorales, tanto de veedores internacionales independientes como de la oposición, que el Consejo Nacional Electoral aún no ha dado a conocer de manera desagregada.\nSegún el Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela (CNE), el líder chavista obtuvo el 51,20 % de los votos (5.150.092 apoyos), frente al 44,2 % de los sufragios de González Urrutia (4.445.978 votos).\nA partir del 10 de enero, fecha en la que comienza el nuevo mandato, Maduro asumirá un tercer período consecutivo para un sexenio al mando del país, gobernado por el chavismo desde hace 25 años.\nDesde que llegó al poder en marzo de 2022, Gabriel Boric ha sido una de las voces más duras en la región contra Maduro, una postura que le ha diferenciado de otros líderes progresistas, como el brasileño, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, o el colombiano, Gustavo Petro.\nLacalle Pou asegura que se confirmó “el fraude” El presidente de Uruguay, Luis Lacalle Pou, también aseguró que el fallo del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Venezuela, confirma “el fraude” que denuncia la comunidad internacional. “El régimen de Maduro confirma lo que la comunidad internacional viene denunciando: el fraude. Una dictadura que cierra todas las puertas a una vida institucional y democrática de su pueblo. No debemos callar ni cesar en defensa de la causa venezolana”, publicó el mandatario en sus redes sociales.\nUruguay figuró, junto a España, la Unión Europea y Estados Unidos, entre los 22 países que solicitaron el viernes pasado la “inmediata publicación de todas las actas originales” de las elecciones del 28 de julio en Venezuela y la verificación “imparcial e independiente” de los resultados de esos comicios.\nMisión de la ONU denuncia falta de imparcialidad La Misión de Determinación de los Hechos de la ONU para Venezuela, dedicada a la investigación de los derechos humanos en este país, denunció “la falta de imparcialidad” tanto del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia como del Consejo Nacional Electoral. Ambas entidades “han desempeñado un papel dentro de la maquinaria represiva del Estado”, señalaron los miembros de la instancia creada por el Consejo de Derechos Humanos de Naciones Unidas, poco después de conocerse el fallo del TSJ.\nEn una declaración emitida a través de redes sociales, la presidenta de la Misión, Marta Valiñas, sostuvo que el chavismo ejerce una “injerencia indebida sobre las decisiones del TSJ a través de mensajes directos a magistrados y declaraciones públicas de Nicolás Maduro y Diosdado Cabello”.\nEl jurista chileno Francisco Cox, otro de los miembros de la Misión, recordó que hace dos años la Asamblea Nacional (Legislativo venezolano), de mayoría oficialista, modificó la membresía del Comité de Postulaciones Judiciales para poder controlarlo. En esas circunstancias eligió a los actuales veinte magistrados y magistradas del TSJ, cuya presidenta, Caryslia Rodríguez, “es militante del gobierno y ha ejercido cargos de elección popular”, recordó.\nTambién el actual presidente del CNE, Elvis Amoroso, ha sido diputado de la Asamblea Nacional por el partido de gobierno, y en el cargo de controlador general fue el responsable de “la inhabilitación arbitraria de María Corina Machado”, agregó Patricia Tappatá, integrante de la Misión.\nEl TSJ asumió la supuesta “validación” de los resultados electorales a solicitud de Maduro, quien presentó un recurso de amparo -que nunca se conoció- por el que fueron convocados los 10 excandidatos presidenciales, aunque Edmundo González Urrutia declinó asistir.",

    "text": "Melania Is On Everyone's Lips After Brutal Testimony At Trump's Hush Money Trial Melania Trump may not be physically present in Donald Trump's hush money trial, but she's still ever so present in everyone's mind. Despite [his unamused expression in court, Donald's](https://www.nickiswift.com/1567743/donald-trump-facial-expressions-fraud-trial-day-5-speaks-volumes/) case is historic as it has become the first time a former president has faced a criminal charge on 34 counts of falsifying records for his alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Daniels was reportedly given hush money by Donald's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, at the end of the 2016 election to keep quiet about their romance. With the trial beginning, Melania became a crucial part of the case and remains on everyone's lips. Trump's team is trying to convince the jury that the payment toward Daniels was to protect his wife and not because he didn't want to sway voters away from his campaign, although that's what the prosecution believes. But Trump's team took a major blow after National Enquirer publisher David Pecker took the stand. The prosecution asked Pecker whether he thought Donald's motive to bury the story about him and Daniels was for Melania or the campaign. The publisher [responded](https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1783539845383495978), \"I thought it was for the campaign.\" They then asked whether the former president ever seemed worried about Melania finding out about his affair with Daniels; Pecker [answered](https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1783540881686982763), \"No.\" Pecker's testimony was damning to Donald's defense, and as the trial continues, we expect the former first lady to continuously be brought up in court as the prosecution attempts to prove Donald paid Daniels to protect his campaign. David Pecker's testimony proved to the public Donald Trump was in it for himself It's unclear what the jury thinks about David Pecker's testimony in Donald Trump's criminal case, but to many, it's clear that Trump never paid Stormy Daniels to protect Melania Trump but rather to protect himself. On X, formerly known as Twitter, people weighed in on Pecker's testimony, and many had the same thing to say. One person [tweeted](https://twitter.com/FourYearsBetter/status/1783548852240334941), \"[He] Doesn't care about Melania or any of his family. Especially not about Barron's graduation. He only wants to protect his image and money.\" Not only was Pecker's testimony proof to many that the former president gave hush money to Daniels for his image, but so is the fact that Melania has not shown up to support her husband during the trial. Since day one, Melania has skipped out on appearing in court, although you may have thought she was there because [her lookalike Margo Martin has been by Donald's side](https://www.nickiswift.com/1562634/melania-nowhere-found-trumps-first-day-court-clone-margo-martin-by-his-side/). Still, between Pecker's testimony and Melania's absence, this speaks volumes to the public and where they think the truth lies. One person [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JoJoFromJerz/status/1783543884586324350), \"No family present in court again to 'support' Donald Trump, who repeatedly told David Pecker and Michael Cohen that he wanted his affairs hidden in order to help himself politically, not to 'protect' Melania or anyone else.\" They continued, \"It was all about him. What he wanted. As it always is.\" Melania Trump's former aide believes she's watching the trial It's known that Melania Trump likes to avoid her husband, Donald Trump's, legal issues no matter what. In August 2023, on the heels of his fourth indictment, a source told [People](https://people.com/melania-trump-private-life-donald-trump-georgia-indictment-7644462), \"She [Melania] hates all of the legal problems and says very little about them anytime anywhere. She leads her own life.\" It seems the former first lady is continuing to take that approach with the hush money trial, but her former aide, Stephanie Grisham, believes Melania is still keeping a close eye on the case. Grisham told [ CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/04/23/melania-trump-hush-money-trial-stephanie-grisham-ebof-digvid.cnn) in April, \"I can guarantee [Melania] is watching every ounce of coverage.\" The former aide grew close with Melania over the years and thinks she will pay close attention to the details revealed in the case. She said, \"Melania is very much about proof, show proof,\" continuing, \"And so if some more damaging stuff should come out that she didn't know about because, of course, her husband continues to deny all of the details here, about Stormy especially.\" In the past, when [Melania seemed to address her husband's affair with Stormy Daniels](https://www.nickiswift.com/1263300/melania-trump-addressed-donald-affair-stormy-daniels-before/), she paid no mind to it. Now, she continues to ignore the drama surrounding Daniels and Donald, at least publicly. However, deep down, Grisham thinks Melania is as tuned in with the trial as everyone else is.",
