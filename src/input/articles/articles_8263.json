    "text": "TIRUPATI: Visible policing, conduct of awareness programmes, enhanced vigil on anti-social elements and focus on conviction helped bring down the crime rate in the year 2023, said superintendent of police (Kurnool) G Krishnakanth.Addressing the media here on Friday after an year-end crime review meeting, he said 33 murders were registered this year against 39 in 2022 and 45 attempt to murder cases registered this year against 86 in 2022, showing a significant decline.SP Krishnakanth attributed the fall in dacoity and house breaking incidents this year to the reorganisation of police beats, use of technology to document fingerprints, constant watch on notorious offenders and better coordination with their counterparts in neighbouring districts and states.“This greatly helped in zeroing in on criminals and also in recovery of stolen goods”, he added.The ‘mobile recovery mela’ helped in restoring stolen mobile phones to their owners. The department recovered as many as 6719 mobile phones worth Rs.14.61 crore. Victims can lodge their complaint at http:kurnoolpolice.in/mobiletheft with details of their lost mobile phones. Similarly, the police cracked the whip on matka, cricket betting and gambling rackets by slapping 592 cases, arresting 1833 persons and seizing cash to the tune of Rs.1.51 crore during the year.",

    "text": "Los últimos días del año llegaron con un clima bastante inusual para la temporada veraniega, la cual se ha visto plagada de lluvias y repentinos cambios de temperatura. Una vez más, el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) lanzó una nueva alerta respecto a esto y dio a conocer que se esperan [ tormentas severas ](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/clima/alerta-meteorologica-nivel-amarillo-por-tormentas-severas-y-fuertes-vientos-a-que-hora-se-larga/)en cierto sector del país. Alerta meteorológica nivel amarillo por temperaturas extremas: qué zonas sufrirán la ola de calor y hasta cuándo Luego del temporal que azotó gran parte de la provincia bonaerense, el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) lanzó una alerta amarilla que trae preocupación a los ciudadanos. En esta oportunidad, los fenómenos meteorológicos que se harán presente en algunas provincias del país son [ tormentas severas](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/clima/alerta-meteorologica-nivel-amarillo-por-tormentas-y-caida-de-granizo-que-zonas-estan-en-peligro-y-cuando-mejora/) y la caída de granizo. En ese sentido, la alerta amarilla se encuentra dirigida para las localidades cordobesas de Santa Rosa de Calamuchita, San Alberto, San Javier y Santa María. Pero no solo en ese sector, sino también en la provincia de San Juan, específicamente en Chacabuco, Junín y Libertador General San Martin. Ese sentido, la alerta amarilla regirá no solo para las últimas horas del jueves 28 de diciembre, sino también para el inicio del viernes 29. Qué significa la alerta amarilla por tormentas severas De acuerdo con la entidad encargada del clima a nivel nacional, la alerta amarilla corresponde a “posibles fenómenos meteorológicos con capacidad de daño y riesgo de interrupción momentánea de actividades cotidianas”. En caso de que dicha alerta sea por tormentas severas, el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional da una serie de recomendaciones para que los ciudadanos tomen precauciones. En ese sentido, la entidad no solo recomienda alejarse de los árboles y evitar salir, sino también evitar estacionar el auto cerca de posibles plantaciones o construcciones que podrían derrumbarse. Otra de las tantas recomendaciones que da la entidad meteorológica es mantener los hogares cerrados, informarse por autoridades y, además, tener una mochila lista en caso de emergencias con la documentación necesaria y los números importantes en caso de cualquier eventualidad inesperada.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

We love it,\" said Kelly Jones, who came down with her kids. Once they got the all clear, friends Beatrix and Leni knew they had to come down. \"The driving ban was lifted and that is awesome because I'm not gonna walk,\" said Leni Nowak. Sledders got creative with their methods for getting down the hill. From the old school toboggan to the new school Amazon cardboard box. And one crew got out the garbage bags. \"It's kinda slick like the bottom of a sled, if it's taut you can kind of fly down and it's really easy...you just kind of penguin down,\" said Simon Reda, Canisius High School student. It's that kind of day you just can't pass up. \"Well, I thought...I'm gonna have school tomorrow, so may as well embrace the snow now,\" said Eloise Eagan. Except, she won't have school, BPS schools will be closed on Tuesday, making this a four-day weekend. So you'll see a lot of people back tomorrow. \"People dread winter, but not us. This is our favorite time,\" said Jones.",

    "text": "With the winter storm season ramping up, rainfall across the state has begun to refill reservoirs. By Tuesday, water reservoirs were at about 64 percent capacity, well above the 30-year average of 55% for the month of December. After last year's historically wet winter, many of California's largest water stores were at or near capacity during the summer months of 2023. But over the last six months, the state has used up some of its stored water. The two largest reservoirs, Lake Oroville and Lake Shasta, dropped from nearly full in June 2023 to around two-thirds full by Christmas. Still, the reservoirs are now in much better shape than they were in December 2022. The images below from the California Department of Water Resources show Lake Oroville at the West Branch Feather River Bridge in December 2022 and December 2023. On Dec. 21, 2022, when the photo on the left was taken, Lake Oroville stood at just 29% of its capacity. By Dec. 14, 2023, when the photo on the right was taken, that figure was 66%. The images below show the same area when Lake Oroville stood at 100% of capacity on June 12, 2023, and again on Dec. 14, 2023, at 66%. The series of atmospheric rivers that drenched the state in late 2022 and early 2023 revived California's water storage. In the images below, Lake Oroville's Bidwell Bar Bridge is pictured on Dec. 21, 2022, and on June 12, 2023. The dramatic difference between the photos shows the amount of water more than tripling in around six months, rising from dangerously low levels to brimming. With another potentially wet winter ahead, reservoirs could be full once more. Experts have projected a warm, wet El Niño winter. But despite several recent storms, another key metric of water storage is well below historical levels. The state's snowpack was at just 29% of normal on Dec. 28, according to DWR data. The photos below from Enterprise Bridge on Lake Oroville show the amount of water more than doubling from December 2022 to December 2023. The levels, which had dropped to about one quarter of capacity last year before filling up entirely by summer 2023, are now at around two-thirds full. Even with last year's wet winter and the downpours that have begun this year's storm season, California's groundwater remains depleted and could take much longer to be replenished.",

El motivo sería la salud de Alperovich que, indicó ese portal, se deterioró. A mediados de julio, la Sala de Feria de la Cámara Nacional de Casación en lo Criminal y Correccional de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires rechazó por unanimidad el recurso interpuesto por la defensa de el ex gobernador para que se lo excarcele. El pasado 18 de junio, la Justicia condenó al político a la pena de 16 años de prisión por los delitos de \"abuso sexual simple\", reiterado en tres oportunidades (dos en grado de tentativa); otros seis hechos de violencia sexual agravados por acceso carnal, mediando intimidación, abuso de relación de dependencia, poder y autoridad, todo en concurso real entre sí, en perjuicio de su sobrina segunda y ex colaboradora laboral. Además, se decretó su inhabilitación perpetua para ejercer cargos públicos a nivel nacional, provincial y municipal y la prisión preventiva. En el fallo, los jueces Daniel Morin, Mauro A. Divito y Jorge L. Rimondi, alegaron que \"una condena no firme, impuesta después del corriente juicio oral y público, llevado a cabo ante el juez de la causa y respetando las formas sustanciales relativas a la acusación, defensa, prueba y sentencia, resulta un parámetro más que razonable para valorar la existencia del riesgo procesal de fuga\". Y agregaron: \"No caben dudas de que Alperovich cuenta con sobrados medios para eludir el resultado del proceso, lo que torna las derivaciones del juez de mérito respecto del riesgo de fuga por demás razonable\". \"No es posible soslayar que el Estado tiene un deber de diligencia reforzado y obligaciones con respecto a la mujer que hacen que las consideraciones efectuadas en la sentencia respecto del riesgo de revictimización lejos estén de derivarse de la instrumentalización del imputado (...), sino de la necesidad de asegurar los compromisos internacionales contraídos\", añadieron. \"Los argumentos de la defensa, relativos a las condiciones de arraigo y a la conducta procesal precedente de Alperovich, no resultan suficientes para conmover los fundamentos del a quo que han sido recogidos en esta resolución ni las medidas alternativas aparecen bastantes para contrarrestar el riesgo aludido\", completaron. En esa línea, los jueces remarcaron que el tiempo de encierro que lleva el imputado \"no se exhibe desproporcionado, máxime en función de la sanción impuesta\" y, de igual modo, sostuvieron que, \"con alguna dilación, está recibiendo el tratamiento médico necesario\". Mientras que en otra línea, añadieron: \"El correcto comportamiento procesal que supuestamente habría demostrado en el caso el imputado no resulta suficiente para neutralizar el riesgo de fuga que deriva del sustancial progreso de la acción penal que importa el dictado de su condena a 16 años de prisión, luego de sustanciado el juicio\".",

    "text": "The Delhi Police have recorded the statements of at least eight people in connection with the low-intensity blast that took place near the Israeli embassy on Tuesday evening, officers aware of the case said on Thursday.The officers said investigators are scrutinising footage from CCTV cameras installed around the site of the blast, and are preparing a list of suspects seen in the vicinity using facial recognition technology by matching their images with the available database of human faces.“We have recorded the statements of almost all people who claimed to have heard the blast. They included security guards of nearby private bungalows and government buildings. We are currently preparing a list of suspects and are verifying their antecedents,” said a senior police officer associated with the probe, asking not to be named.Investigators said the role of at least four people is under the scanner as their movement around the embassy and the blast site that was captured on CCTV footage seemed suspicious, but these four are yet to be identified.Meanwhile, the police are yet to receive forensic reports of the exhibits collected from the site of the blast by Delhi’s forensic science laboratory (FSL) as well as by forensic experts from the National Security Guard (NSG) and National Investigation Agency (NIA), officers said.According to the senior officer quoted above, the exhibits lifted from the site include soil, grass, leaves and some garbage items lying around. “The experts of all three agencies would focus on ascertaining the nature of the blast and find out the explosive item or chemical that was used. The forensic examination reports of all three agencies will be examined to establish if there is any commonality in regard to the nature of the blast and explosive items used. Further legal action depends on their outcome,” the officer said.Separately, an officer from an anti-terror unit roped in for assistance, on condition of anonymity, said that a few ball bearings and the broken dial of a watch were collected from the blast site by forensic experts.“As no visible residue of any explosive or chemical was found at the blast site, it’s difficult to say whether the recovered items were related to the explosion or they were just part of the garbage lying nearby. Only the forensics will be able to find a correlation,” the officer of the anti-terror unit said.",
