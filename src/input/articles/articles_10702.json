    "text": "Case Insights:\nFrom Powerhouse to Pariah: Legendary defense attorney David Kenner faces potential disbarment following a criminal contempt conviction. Breach of Trust : Prosecutors revealed Kenner gave protected discovery to unauthorized individuals in violation of a protective order. Ties to High-Profile Clients : What could Kenner’s misconduct mean for Suge Knight, Tory Lanez, and the security of protected witnesses and confidential information? By Samuel Lopez – USA Herald\nLos Angeles, CA – Once celebrated for defending rap moguls like Marion “Suge” Knight, veteran attorney David Elliot Kenner now stands on the precipice of professional ruin.\nThe LA Times wrote an article about Kenner in 1996 called “Lawyer for Rap Mogul Known for Aggressive Work” written by Henry Weinstein.\nHe was a man who once held the fate of superstars in his hands, but today is fighting for his very right to practice law.\nKenner’s license to practice law in California—active since January 5, 1968—is at risk after a criminal conviction for contempt of court under 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) ​. His violation? Disclosing confidential discovery materials in a federal case to individuals explicitly barred from access—an act prosecutors described as “willful, intentional, and reckless” ​.\nIn United States v. Prakazrel Michel , the government charged Kenner with criminal contempt, alleging he “willfully, intentionally, and recklessly” violated a May 14, 2019 protective order​. According to court records:\n“Kenner shared and caused to be shared covered discovery material with persons to whom he was not permitted to provide the material under the terms of the order.”\nThe discovery material included grand jury documents and sensitive information meant only for defense counsel, and other authorized individuals.\nOver a period spanning from December 14, 2022, to March 3, 2023, these unauthorized individuals accessed confidential documents​ and grand jury minutes about his Grammy-winning client, Prakazrel “Pras” Michel , one of a trio who founded the 1990s hip-hop band The Fugees.\nKenner ultimately pleaded guilty. On January 26, 2024 , he was sentenced in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to one year of unsupervised probation and a $5,000 fine ​.\nThe plea was a stunning twist in a complex espionage case involving the former rapper.\nKenner’s history of State Bar violations includes an incident on March 22, 2002, when a conviction record was transmitted under State Bar court case No. 02-C-10990. Another violation occurred on April 17, 2003, resulting in disciplinary measures that included probation without an actual suspension. His most recent disciplinary action took place on June 27, 2024.\nThe Stakes at the State Bar Court With his criminal conviction now final, the California State Bar Court initiated formal disciplinary proceedings under Business and Professions Code §§ 6101-6102 ​​.\nAs of July 18, 2024 , the State Bar Court ruled that Kenner’s misconduct merited a formal hearing to determine:\n“Whether the facts and circumstances surrounding the violation of which respondent was convicted involved moral turpitude or other misconduct warranting discipline, and if so found, the discipline to be imposed.”\nUnder California law, conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude —conduct contrary to justice, honesty, or good morals—can result in summary disbarment . The stakes could not be higher: if found guilty, Kenner will be permanently stripped of his ability to practice law.\nThe State Bar Court has scheduled the next status conference for May 5, 2025 before Judge Dennis G. Saab​. Trial dates and potential discipline will hinge on whether Kenner’s actions are adjudged to meet the high standard of “moral turpitude.”\nAbatement or Delay? In a separate maneuver, Kenner’s legal team recently negotiated a Stipulation and Proposed Order to Abate Action ​. This agreement, signed November 14, 2024, temporarily pauses proceedings pending resolution of a related State Bar investigation ( Case No. 24-0-17730 )​.\nThe parties acknowledged in court documents:\n“The Parties discussed and agreed upon an approach for a universal settlement that includes the present action as well as the Respondent’s pending State Bar Investigation.”\nThus, while Kenner’s discipline remains pending, the clock is ticking.\nFallout: What Does This Mean for Suge Knight and Others? Kenner’s recent attempt to withdraw from Suge Knight’s defense —denied by a Los Angeles judge who ruled it was too close to trial—now takes on ominous significance. Is Kenner’s sudden desire to bail out linked to his own legal peril?\nGiven Kenner’s mishandling of confidential materials in the Prakazrel Michel case, serious questions arise about his access to protected information in other high-stakes matters—especially Knight’s ongoing civil retrial.\nKenner has also represented Tory Lanez, who was convicted of shooting and harassing Megan Thee Stallion .\nKenner’s recent conduct begs the question, if he mishandled protected materials in the past, could confidential information, witnesses, victims, or informants now be at risk?\nCould Kenner’s current or former clients possess leverage over Kenner—knowing he violated protective orders before—and use that information to pressure or manipulate him?\nKenner’s downfall should serve as a flashing red warning to the entire legal community. Protective orders are not suggestions; they are binding court orders with the force of law.\nAs articulated in the protective order Kenner violated:\n“No discovery material shall be provided to any individual or entity except as provided herein… or as further ordered by the Court.”\nViolations of such orders endanger witnesses, taint trials, and erode the integrity of the justice system.\nNo lawyer—no matter how high-profile—can place personal interests above their sworn ethical duties. – Samuel Lopez\nThe coming months will determine whether Kenner is allowed to remain a lawyer—or if his decades-long career will be erased under the heavy gavel of the State Bar Court.\nOne thing is certain: the legal community, the entertainment world, and the broader public will be watching.\nCase citation: Kenner, David Elliot.

    "text": "El presidente del Organismo Internacional de la Energía Atómica (OIEA), Rafael Gross (EFE/EPA/KIMIMASA MAYAMA) El director general del Organismo Internacional de la Energía Atómica ( OIEA ), Rafael Grossi , confirmó que visitará la próxima semana la central nuclear de Kursk, en Rusia, con vistas a evaluar el impacto en estas instalaciones del conflicto que se vive en la zona .\n“La actividad militar en las inmediaciones de una central de energía nuclear supone un grave riesgo”, dijo Grossi, que confía en revisar de primera mano la situación sobre el terreno. Aspira, añadió, a realizar una evaluación “independiente”.\nGrossi ya se ha reunido con el representante permanente de Rusia ante las organizaciones internacionales en Viena, Mijail Uliánov . Según el OIEA, Moscú informó a la agencia de que ha localizado restos de un dron en el interior del complejo de la central, a unos cien metros del edificio que almacena el combustible ya agotado, después de un supuesto ataque ucraniano perpetrado este jueves.\nLa central nuclear de Kursk se ubica en la ciudad de Kurchátov , a unos 60 kilómetros de la frontera con Ucrania. La región es desde hace unas semanas escenario de una inédita incursión de fuerzas ucranianas, que ya tendrían bajo su control casi un centenar de localidades.\nPor su parte, Ucrania negó este jueves que sus tropas intentaran atacar la central nuclear.\nUn edificio dañado por ataques ucranianos, tras la invasión de las fuerzas ucranianas en la región de Kursk, en Kursk, Rusia (Rusia, Ucrania) EFE/EPA/STRINGER Kiev rechaza de esta forma unas declaraciones realizadas horas antes por el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin , en las que acusaba a Ucrania de haber tratado de atacar la central durante la pasada noche sin dar más detalles al respecto.\n“El escenario deseado por Rusia, según el cual las Fuerzas Armadas de Ucrania estarían atacando la Central Nuclear de Kursk para acusarlas de terrorismo nuclear, no se sostiene”, dijo el jefe del departamento para combatir la desinformación del Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Nacional y Defensa de Ucrania, Andrí Kovalenko, citado por la publicación Kyiv Independent .\nKovalenko aseguró que “todo apunta al hecho de que Rusia puede llevar a cabo por sí misma esta provocación” para acusar a Ucrania ante la opinión pública internacional.\nUcrania y Rusia se han acusado en repetidas ocasiones mutuamente de atacar la central nuclear de la región ucraniana de Zaporizhzhia, bajo control de Rusia desde los primeros días de la invasión militar rusa.\nEstas mismas acusaciones cruzadas han empezado a repetirse ahora respecto a la central nuclear de Kursk, situada en territorio bajo control ruso en esa región fronteriza con Ucrania en la que Kiev ha tomado el control de algunas zonas.\nInstalan refugios de hormigón en Kursk Las autoridades rusas de Kursk, escenario de una incursión fronteriza ucraniana, comenzaron hoy a instalar refugios de hormigón en la homónima capital regional y anunciaron iguales planes para la ciudad nuclear de Kurchátov.\nSegún informó en Telegram Alexéi Smirnov, gobernador interino, el jueves empezó la construcción en los principales lugares de concentración de población, como plazas públicas.\nTambién se instalarán esos refugios junto a las principales paradas de autobús de Kursk, ciudad de menos de medio millón de habitantes.\nSmirnov precisó que ya se han elegido los lugares para erigir refugios en la localidad de Zhelesnogorsk, que no llega a los 100.000 habitantes.\nAdemás, en breve se anunciará el número de refugios que se construirán en la localidad de Kurchátov, conocida por acoger en sus inmediaciones la central nuclear de Kursk.",

    "text": "New Zealand to Train 10,000 Frontline Workers in Family and Sexual Violence Response\nThe training spans a wide array of agencies—justice, corrections, and police—with tailored content aligned to each sector’s role in supporting victim-survivors and preventing further harm.\n- Country:\n- New Zealand\nIn a major step to strengthen the frontline response to family and sexual violence, the New Zealand government is rolling out extensive new training for staff across critical public services. The initiative, which aims to train 10,000 workers over the next two years, forms a core element of the country’s broader Te Aorerekura strategy to prevent and respond to violence.\nTargeted, Practice-Focused Training\nKaren Chhour, Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence, emphasized the transformative potential of this training: “This will ensure victim-survivors receive best practice support and will empower staff to safely recognise, refer, and respond to family and sexual violence.”\nThe training spans a wide array of agencies—justice, corrections, and police—with tailored content aligned to each sector’s role in supporting victim-survivors and preventing further harm. “This is not just a box-ticking exercise,” Chhour said. “It’s about building the confidence and competence of those who are often first in contact with victims.”\nTraining Highlights Across Agencies\n-\nMinistry of Justice: Over 800 court-related staff have already received specialist training, with the ministry targeting an additional 500 personnel annually going forward.\n-\nDepartment of Corrections: More than 4,700 staff have undergone essential-level family violence training, aimed at enhancing safety both within correctional facilities and among the communities corrections staff serve.\n-\nNew Zealand Police: The training curriculum for new recruits was redesigned in 2024 to include a dedicated two-week module on family violence. In its first year, over 550 recruits completed the program, and projections suggest over 850 will be trained by the end of 2025.\nPart of Te Aorerekura Action Plan\nThe rollout is a key component of the second Te Aorerekura Action Plan, New Zealand’s national strategy for eliminating family and sexual violence through a unified, multi-agency approach.\n“The Action Plan sets out a number of bold but necessary targets,” Minister Chhour said. “Achieving them will require sustained cross-agency collaboration and reinforced commitment across the public sector.”\nChhour praised the early progress as a sign of growing alignment and urgency among government departments, noting that the integrated response model was already delivering measurable improvements in service delivery and victim engagement.\nA Cultural and Structural Shift\nTe Aorerekura envisions not only procedural improvements, but a cultural shift in how agencies understand, discuss, and tackle family and sexual violence. Training is seen as a foundation for embedding that change, especially at the frontline where victims often seek help first.\n“This boldness is needed to improve the support provided to victim-survivors and will empower these frontline workers to undertake their roles with the greatest care,” Chhour said.\nAs the training programs expand, the government expects more than just improved individual capabilities. It anticipates a more coordinated, trauma-informed, and survivor-centered approach to family and sexual violence—one that helps reduce re-traumatization and promotes long-term safety and wellbeing for individuals, whānau, and communities across Aotearoa.",

    "title": "Year in review: Controversy strikes in Mount Anthony-South Burlington baseball game",
    "text": "One of the more bizarre sequences you will ever see on a baseball field took place May 4 when South Burlington visited Bennington. Was it a home run? That question befuddled many in attendance that spring day – including the umpiring crew – during Mount Anthony baseball’s 4-3 victory over South Burlington.\nThe play in question came off the bat of MAU’s Connor Hannan in the bottom of the third inning and the score even at one. The MAU slugger crushed a line drive to left center that smashed off the top of the outfield fence and ricocheted back into play in the outfield. Hannan put on the breaks at second as both runners that were on base crossed home plate, giving MAU a 3-1 lead.\nAfter a moment of standing on base, the infield umpire signaled it was indeed a home run. Hannan made the trot to home plate and was greeted by the entire MAU roster and put his team up 4-1.\nNot so fast.\nSouth Burlington manager Luke Goyette was there to contest the call before Hannan could even cross home plate, leading to a discussion between the umpiring crew. The Wolves manager claimed that the ball never left the field of play.\nAfter chatting for a couple of minutes, the umpires sent Hannan back to second base, changing the ruling on the field to a double.\nThe controversial call centered around if the ball first hit the net draped over left field, which is considered out of play and thus a home run, or not.\nThe ball could clearly be heard bouncing off the top of the fencing from the third baseline.\n“I feel like I saw a home run,” MAU manager Trevor Coyne said after the game. \"It clearly hit the net, and I think when it hit the net it hit the fence posting and bounced back, which is what I saw.\"\nAs soon as Hannan was issued back to second base, MAU’s coaching staff approached the crew to get an explanation on the reversed call – which led to further discussion and investigation.\nAfter a meeting at the mound, members from both coaching staffs and the umpiring crew made the trek to the outfield to examine the scene of the play.\nAfter further consideration the umpires once again reversed the call, this time back to the original ruling of home run, and Hannan made his second trot home. The break in play lasted roughly 15 minutes as things got sorted out.\nGoyette said the confusion stemmed from the ground rules explained before the game, but added the play wasn't the deciding factor in the outcome.\n\"The umpires went back and forth, and per the rules we were explained to, none of it fits,\" he said. \"But I think it's cleared up, and (MAU) played really well.\"\nHannan's blast was the outlier in what was otherwise a pitching duel between himself and South Burlington's Nick Kelly. The Wolves lefty tossed five innings, striking out eight batters, walking two and allowing three earned runs.\n\"He threw well,\" Goyette said. \"He used his pitches and tried to miss barrels.\"\nHannan was just as competitive on the bump for the Patriots, tossing a complete game in his first pitching outing of the season. Hannan, coming off a hamstring injury, grinded out 111 pitches. He let his defense do the work for him, striking out just four batter, but his control was on point. The MAU starter issued just one walk, and limited the Wolves bats to six hits throughout.\nThe two teams met again in the Division I semifinals on June 6, with MAU once again emerging with a\none-run victory. The win clinched MAU's first trip to the Division I state championship since 2011. CVU went on to be crowned champions, defeating MAU 6-0 in the title game on June 10.",
