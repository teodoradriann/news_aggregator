    "title": "PCX Markets sees sharp rise in demand and impact from recycling, upcycling projects",
    "text": "PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles rank as one of the most recycled and upcycled waste materials. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO IMPACT through upcycling and recycling credits on PCX Markets, which helps fund plastic waste recovery, skyrocketed by 1,500 percent in 2023 as large corporations looked for new ways to meet sustainability goals and compliance requirements. The sale of those credits helped fund the upcycling or recycling of 9,000,000 kg plastic waste last year alone. The jump in demand for credits issued by recycling and upcycling projects, which channel much-needed funding into the waste management sector, illustrates how the Philippines&#039; new Extended Producer Responsibility Act is fueling the effective and economically viable development of a circular economy. One of the projects on the PCX Markets platform is an upcycler based in Bulacan that uses plastics from beverage cartons and other low-value flexible items, like sachets, to create boards for use in construction and furniture. An overall rise in demand for credits in 2023 helped support this upcycler&#039;s operating costs; as a result, they aim to triple their processing capacity by September of 2024. Another project on the marketplace, based in Davao, recycles PET bottles into flakes that can be used in various products such as plastic containers, PET straps and fibers used in clothing. Rising demand for credits has helped reduce the volatility brought on by fluctuations in demand for flakes, giving this recycler the confidence to invest in more capacity for 2024 and beyond. The recycler estimates that the new infrastructure will allow them to process an additional 1 million kg of plastic waste into flakes every month, representing a 15 percent increase over last year. In 2022 the Philippines passed an Extended Producer Responsibility Act requiring corporations with assets over PHP 100 million to recover and divert 20 percent of their accountable plastic packaging footprint by the end of 2023. The recovery and diversion target increases to 40 percent by end of 2024, and in increments of 10% every year until 80% by end of 2028 and beyond. Under the law, companies have a range of strategies to choose from, including reducing their plastic packaging footprint through elimination of unnecessary plastics, use of reusable and recyclable packaging or inclusion of recycled content, and implementing recovery and diversion programs. This can include plastic credits, which fund the cleanup and responsible processing of the equivalent amount of plastic waste. All strategies and programs intended to be used for EPR compliance are to be verified by independent third party auditors. The Philippines is at the epicenter of the world&#039;s plastic waste crisis. The country consumes over 2,150,000 metric tons of plastic each year. Just 9 percent is recycled and according to a 2020 WWF report a whopping 35 percent0 makes its way into the environment. Like most emerging markets, part of the problem is the lack of waste management and recycling infrastructure, from collection through to transportation and responsible processing. Companies that want to complement upstream reduction efforts by funding downstream plastic waste recovery can purchase credits issued by projects, including recyclers and upcyclers, that want to raise funds to expand capacity. One credit cleans up one metric ton of plastic pollution. PCX Markets expects demand to continue to increase throughout this year, helping fund the expansion of recycling and upcycling capacity in 2024 and beyond.",

    "title": "Better sleep is a protective factor against dementia",
    "text": "Dementia is a progressive loss of cognitive abilities, such as memory, that is significant enough to have an impact on a person’s daily activities.\nIt can be caused by a number of different diseases, including Alzheimer’s , which is the most common form. Dementia is caused by a loss of neurons over a long period of time. Since, by the time symptoms appear, many changes in the brain have already occurred, many scientists are focusing on studying the risk and protective factors for dementia.\nA risk factor, or conversely, a protective factor, is a condition or behaviour that increases or reduces the risk of developing a disease, but does not guarantee either outcome. Some risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, such as age or genetics, are not modifiable, but there are several other factors we can influence, specifically lifestyle habits and their impact on our overall health .\nThese risk factors include depression, lack of physical activity, social isolation, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption and smoking, as well as poor sleep.\nWe have been focusing our research on the question of sleep for over 10 years, particularly in the context of the Framingham Heart Study . In this large community-based cohort study, ongoing since the 1940s, the health of surviving participants has been monitored to the present day. As researchers in sleep medicine and epidemiology, we have expertise in researching the role of sleep and sleep disorders in cognitive and psychiatric brain aging.\nAs part of our research, we monitored and analyzed the sleep of people aged 60 and over to see who did — or did not — develop dementia.\nSleep as a risk or protective factor against dementia Sleep appears to play an essential role in a number of brain functions, such as memory. Good quality sleep could therefore play a vital role in preventing dementia .\nSleep is important for maintaining good connections in the brain . Recently, research has revealed that sleep seems to have a function similar to that of a garbage truck for the brain: deep sleep could be crucial for eliminating metabolic waste from the brain , including clearing certain proteins, such as those known to accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.\nHowever, the links between deep sleep and dementia still have to be clarified.\nWhat is deep sleep? During a night’s sleep, we go through several sleep stages that succeed one another and are repeated.\nNREM sleep (non-rapid eye movement sleep) is divided into light NREM sleep (NREM1 stage), NREM sleep (NREM2 stage) and deep NREM sleep, also called slow-wave sleep (NREM3 stage). The latter is associated with several restorative functions. Next, REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep) is the stage generally associated with the most vivid dreams. An adult generally spends around 15 to 20 per cent of each night in deep sleep, if we add up all the periods of NREM3 sleep.\nSeveral sleep changes are common in adults, such as going to bed and waking up earlier, sleeping for shorter periods of time and less deeply, and waking up more frequently during the night.\nSleep stages, and the role of deep sleep for brain health. (Andrée-Ann Baril) Loss of deep sleep linked to dementia Participants in the Framingham Heart Study were assessed using a sleep recording — known as polysomnography — on two occasions, approximately five years apart, in 1995-1998 and again in 2001-2003.\nMany people showed a reduction in their deep slow-wave sleep over the years, as is to be expected with aging. Conversely, the amount of deep sleep in some people remained stable or even increased.\nOur team of researchers from the Framingham Heart Study followed 346 participants aged 60 and over for a further 17 years to observe who developed dementia and who did not.\nProgressive loss of deep sleep over time was associated with an increased risk of dementia, whatever the cause, and particularly Alzheimer’s type dementia. These results were independent of many other risk factors for dementia.\nAlthough our results do not prove that loss of deep sleep causes dementia, they do suggest that it could be a risk factor in the elderly. Other aspects of sleep may also be important, such as its duration and quality.\nStrategies to improve deep sleep Knowing the impact of a lack of deep sleep on cognitive health, what strategies can be used to improve it?\nFirst and foremost, if you’re experiencing sleep problems, it’s worth talking to your doctor. Many sleep disorders are underdiagnosed and treatable, particularly through behavioural (i.e. non-medicinal) approaches.\nAdopting good sleep habits can help, such as going to bed and getting up at consistent times or avoiding bright or blue light in bed, like that of screens.\nYou can also avoid caffeine, limit your alcohol intake, maintain a healthy weight, be physically active during the day, and sleep in a comfortable, dark and quiet environment.\nThe role of deep sleep in preventing dementia remains to be explored and studied. Encouraging sleep with good lifestyle habits could have the potential to help us age in a healthier way.\nThis article was originally published in French\nSleep Dementia Mental health Brain Lifestyle Aging Physiology Health Healthy eating REM sleep Alzheimer's disease Framingham Heart Study Sleep cycles Healthy eating habits",

Fans dürfen sich auf Innovationen freuen!\nIngolstadt/London – 2026 wird ein besonderes Jahr für die Formel 1. Erstmals seit Jahren kommt mit Cadillac ein neues Team in die Serie. Und auch Audi steigt gemeinsam mit Sauber als Hersteller in die Königsklasse ein. Nach einigen personellen Veränderungen nimmt das Projekt nun langsam an Fahrt auf.\nSo eröffnete das Team Anfang Juli sein Technologiezentrum in Biecester Motion unweit des Silverstone Circuit. Und auch einen Titelpartner hat das künftige Formel-1-Team von Audi bereits gefunden. Am Mittwoch stellte die VW-Tochter Revolut als neuen Partner vor.\nFormel-1-Partnerschaft von Audi und Revolut geht über Sponsoring hinaus\n„Audi betritt die Formel 1 mit einem klaren Anspruch: Die Plattform als technologisch relevante und wirtschaftlich nachhaltige Investition in die Zukunft der Marke Audi zu nutzen“, betont Markenchef Gernot Döllner. „Mit Revolut haben wir einen Partner gefunden, der unsere Ambitionen und Haltung teilt. Als globale Bühne bietet uns die Formel 1 die Chance, gemeinsam neue Zielgruppen zu erreichen und für unsere Produkte zu begeistern.“\nDie Partnerschaft zwischen Audi und dem globalen Fintech-Unternehmen Revolut geht über ein reines Sponsoring hinaus. Zusammen wollen beide Marken eine neue Art und Weise der Fan-Interaktion an Rennwochenenden etablieren. Dazu gehören einmalige Erlebnisse „für eine neue Generation von Motorsportbegeisterten“ sowie exklusive Vorteile für Revolut-Kunden.\nFormel-1-Fans profitieren von Partnscherschaft von Audi und Revolut\nZudem soll Revolut Buisness umfassend in die Finanzprozesse des Formel-1-Teams von Audi integriert werden. Auch hier sollen die Fans von der Partnerschaft der beiden Unternehmen profitieren. „Revolut wird nahtlose Checkout-Lösungen für Team-Merchandise bereitstellen und so ein hochwertiges, intuitives Einkaufserlebnis ermöglichen“, betont Audi in seiner Pressemitteilung.\nEine Frage bleibt jedoch noch unbeantwortet: Auf welchen Namen wird das Team von Audi-Sauber im kommenden Jahr hören? Als Titelpartner dürfte Revolut auch hier prominent vertreten sein. Wie genau der Rennstall aber heißt, wird spätestens mit der Meldeliste der FIA bekannt. (smo)",

    "text": "July was a brutal weather month. Many regions across our country experienced extreme weather patterns. Wildfires, excessive heat, monsoon rainfall, tornadoes and a strong hurricane ravaged numerous sections of our country. Locally, our weather featured hot and dry conditions. Our rainfall is sparse. We need steady soaking rains. My lawn is brown and cut every two weeks or so, but only the high spots. My hedges are another summer story. Hedges love hot and humid weather. They grow quickly in these conditions, thus needing regular trimming. My July morning runs featured a disturbing sight. Many leaves are withered, changing color and dropping due to our extended dry weather. Running past these July leaves produces a chill. It’s too early for falling leaves. A recent July news story has me scanning the roadside for a view of mysterious objects. Apparently for several years, and mostly out west, monolith structures are appearing in the strangest locations. The most recent monolith appeared on a Colorado farm. This monolith was taken down by the landowners due to the crop damage and trash left behind by curious gawkers. These monoliths attract huge crowds, creating numerous issues for the land owners. Consequently, this monolith was removed. The landowner used a large excavator to remove this nine-foot-tall, four-foot-wide and eight-inch-deep monolith. The land owner said he’s storing the monolith. There was no mention of the monolith’s weight. There were numerous monolith sightings out in the western United States. These structures appear, creating news stories. So I scan my surroundings, looking for the first Greater Johnstown monolith. Well, it could happen. Another July news story created a “Wow!” on my morning run. It seems that every July 1, retired baseball player Bobby Bonilla receives a $1.19 million check from his former team, the New York Mets. This is a great example of astute and savvy financial planning. Bonilla hasn’t played in 20 years. These guaranteed payments are received every year until 2035. Another area along my running routes made the July news. Back in 1975, 74 acres or so on Schoolhouse Road in Richland Township was sold by the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown to the MetLife Insurance Co. I ran by, watching that building and grounds undergoing construction and landscaping. Eventually, I ran past the employees driving to work. The MetLife parking lot became my shortcut to the Pitt-Johnstown cross country course. Now, this old MetLife building and grounds are being sold back to Pitt-Johnstown. The rezoning process is underway. Just what will Pitt-Johns-town do with that building and grounds? Although I never had any issues running up and down Schoolhouse Road, this area’s unique geographic location created winter driving issues for many MetLife employees. The wide-open old farm fields surrounding the Greater Johnstown Career and Technology Center and the MetLife building was a driving nightmare for these employees. The winter winds formed huge drifts across Schoolhouse Road. I ran around them, but motorists had to stay on the road. Despite the valiant efforts by the Richland road crews, Mother Nature always won. The end result of these wintry road conditions were numerous complaint letters published in The Tribune Democrat’s letters to the editor section. Another local news story featured a fascinating opportunity. Windber Area School District agreed to purchase the Iron Horse Sports Complex, located in Paint Township. This athletic site is a state-of-the-art sports venue. A key component is the large under-roof practice facility. Windber’s athletic teams and the band can now practice year-round in a dry environment. The Iron Horse purchase by Windber was a wise decision. The student and public benefits are enormous. Yet many voiced their opposition to this purchase. Using our recreational opportunities is key to a healthy life. We end on an incredible note. Kaylee Frederick, a 19-year-old Pitt-Johnstown student, recently completed her second Death Valley Badwater 135 run. This 135-mile race begins at the Badwater Basin and finished at the Mount Whitney portal. Ninety-seven runners began this race, but only 79 finished the course. Frederick completed the grueling nonstop course in 36:13:31. She cut four hours off her 2023 finishing time. Well done, Kaylee Frederick! George A. Hancock is a local runner and writer.",
