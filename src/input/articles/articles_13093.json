    "text": "eSIM: a Technology that Reduces Costs and Enhances Business Flexibility 02-27-2025 11:20 PM CET | Associations & Organizations\nPress release from: ABNewswire\nIn a world where mobility is driving productivity, how companies manage to cross the line of mobile responsibility makes a difference, and it should reduce the cost of the business and make global connectivity easier. The eSIM (embedded SIM) has come to be looked at as a way to simplify business device manageability and escalate operational agility.\nThe implementation of eSIM technology enables businesses to disconnect from physical SIM card infrastructure while reducing roaming costs combining line management through a single platform and escalating their communication security. The modern business world relies heavily on telecommuting and mobile working operations while eSIM Plus [ https://esimplus.me/ ] solutions transform bandwidth control models for companies.\nWhat Does eSIM Cut Costs From Business?\nThe implementation of eSIM within corporate telecommunications systems creates substantial financial savings throughout different operational areas. Companies can reduce their budget costs and enhance operational excellence through the elimination of physical SIM expenses along with excessive roaming fees.\nElimination of Roaming and International Connectivity Costs\nOne of the biggest bills that businesses with extensive mobile workforces incur is global roaming charges, which are one of the largest fees globally because they depend greatly on domestic and provider standards. With an eSIM, employees can:\n* The solution allows businesses to obtain SIM cards that support local data plans through 190 different countries without requiring new cards during international travel.\n* Amps up money conservation by guarding users from the high border fees of common operators.\n* Users can maintain secure fast internet access using eSIMs instead of flex data plans during their trips on a contract in any flexible manner.\nWhen sales representatives need to work between Spain, France, and Germany their eSIM will activate local data plans without requiring them to worry about additional costs or SIM changes.\nReduction of Costs in Corporate Lines Management\nThe procedure for handling mobile lines that also requires management intervention and top-up funds involves these steps:\n* The organization manages physical SIM card acquisitions and dissemination together with new device and employee replacements.\n* The establishment of new communication lines together with their setup and configuration requires to be misdirected time and resources.\n* The company maintains strict carrier contracts, suffers limitations in free access, and receives limited tariff flexibility.\nThe elimination of these problems is possible through eSIM technology because it allows the following benefits:\n* The system enables real-time access to modify lines through remote capabilities.\n* A single platform can control all corporate numbers.\n* Using eSIM eliminates two security risks: first, users avoid losing their SIM card, and second, they achieve improved data security.\nCost Optimization in Data Plans\nEvery employee has different connectivity requirements. With eSIM, companies can:\n* Personalize data plans from the user profile (executives, sales, technicians, etc.).\n* Automatically monitor and manage your data consumption to avoid worthless data excess charges.\n* See usage in real-time, helping with a better budget.\nAlso, thanks to options such as eSIM Plus, operators can enjoy special discounts and preferential prices, which lead to bigger savings.\nLower SIM Card Logistics and Distribution Costs\nEmployees' physical SIM card operations require expensive logistical processes of buying, shipping, and renewing the cards between employees. Companies lower business costs through the employment of eSIM since distant assignment and control eradicate the need to physically transport the SIM cards as well as the replacements.\nIncreased Durability and Reduced Risk of Loss\nMultiple expenses arise because physical SIM cards often become damaged or are lost, so their replacements become necessary. Embedded eSIM enables removal of such risks because it resides inside the device which also decreases replacement costs of damaged or lost cards.\nFlexibility and Total Control in Device Management\nCorporate management of mobile phones together with cost savings is diminished upon deployment of eSIM. Technology provides companies with more effective management of connection links, and higher security together with easier distant access to the networks regardless of geographical location.\nRemote and Centralized Management\nRemote administration of the ability of eSIM is facilitated through:\n* IT administrators can turn on, off, or change plans with no touch-n-link type intervention.\n* Lines can even be activated in minutes, without ever having to expect SIM card delivery.\n* Numbers can be easily reconfigured sotallying staff rotation with no requirement for any actual device mods.\nIncreased Security for Corporate Data\nDespite having traditional SIMs easily being stolen, lost, or duplicated in this it hurts businesses a great deal. Upon using eSIM:\n* The possibility of SIM theft is eliminated as it is pre-installed with the device.\n* Data is more protected because unauthorized access is prevented.\n* Biometric authentication can secure each device.\nMulti-Device Support\neSIM is not only for smartphones, but you can integrate the same into:\n* Business tablets for meetings, presentations, or any other fieldwork.\n* Smartwatches with LTE, allow you to stay connected hands-free and phone-free.\n* IoT (Internet of Things) devices that need \"real-time remote\" to collect data, operate logistics, or manage fleets.\nThis makes eSIM highly flexible for businesses that have to link up multiple devices without being physically constrained.\nFlexibility for Hybrid and Remote Work Models\nThe increasing hybrid work structure makes it possible for employees to maintain network connections across any workplace through eSIM features. Distributed companies operating in various regions gain access to high-speed mobile connectivity through eSIM functionality while omitting the need for physical SIM requirements.\nRemote Management of Mobile Lines\nRelevant organizations can handle every corporate line through a single unified interface which provides:\n* The system allows line management through a remote interface instead of manual handling.\n* A few clicks can let employees switch numbers and select new operators on the platform.\n* The same device enables employees who work in different locations and handle numerous business sectors to handle multiple profiles.\neSIM Plus: The Best Choice for Enterprises\nThe market presents eSIM Plus as a top-notch solution when your company demands dependable eSIM functionality:\n* Coverage in more than 190 countries, ideal for internationally mobile work teams.\n* Simplified management of multiple corporate lines, without administrative complications.\n* Scalable and personalized data plans for different employee classes.\n* Discounts and favorable pricing for businesses through savings on telecommunications impacts.\nOrganizations are presently relying on eSIM for dynamic telecommunication management via a secure and economical solution. The technology is a vital tool for every organization size due to its remote line management roaming charge reduction and data usage optimization features.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: eSIM Plus\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail:Send Email [ https://www.abnewswire.com/email_contact_us.php?pr=esim-a-technology-that-reduces-costs-and-enhances-business-flexibility ]\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://esimplus.me/\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.

    "title": "Comment on Funding Shifts Corrupting Christianity: Trump & Compassion Intl Lanka by Sumihiro",
    "text": "IFES in Sri Lanka\nUS President Donald Trump, elected by America’s Christian right, shut down the best of the US Government – especially USAID. A short reprieve has come from federal courts. The stay was ordered mainly because the stoppage reversed funds authorized by Congress and would violate contracts. It would leave the destitute in the lurch.\nIn Sri Lanka, our Election Commission gets government funds for basics. But there is a lot more to be done. We had merely to ask the International Federation of Electoral Systems (IFES). It had a large bureau in Colombo under Beverly Hagadorn to work closely with us. USAID’s Colombo Director Reed Aeschliman was approachable and paid us courtesy calls.\nIFES supports ECSL in responding to emerging electoral threats, safeguarding democratic principles, and building the leadership capacity of women, youth, and people with disabilities.\nThese efforts for democracy are endangered.\nFaith in Heroes is Peculiar\nDespite our intellectual endowments, faith has a way of making us hold on to what defies reason. Many American Christians voted for Trump for selling golden Bibles and despite his boasting of conquests grabbing women by their genitals. For Americans who voted for him, their faith in heroes like Trump is unshakeable, like for the American tele-evangelicals Jimmy Swaggert and Jim Bakker who retained many followers even after exposure.\nWe see this in a Trincomalee district Grace Fellowship free-church Pastor Selvarajah Jeyakanth who ran an orphange where a worker was imprisoned for years and fined by High Court Judge Ilancheliyan (for abusing retarded girl inmates). Another died in jail during trial. Judge Ilancheliyan blamed Jeyakanth.\nJeyakanth’s donors in London took long to wake up to his iniquities. A reluctant inquiry visiting from London, could not convince donors to stop funding him. His original, main London backer Metropolitan Tabernacle, finally disowned him and the Lanka Evangelical Fellowship of Churches (LEFC) on 31 Aug. 2023.\nSuch unwavering support we see for Trump; and for Sai Baba in surviving the BBC exposure of his massaging the genitals of teenaged boys with oil.\nThat is faith in heroes!\nIndia’s Crackdown on NGOs\nTrump’s kick in our stomachs came after India’s Hindutva Narendra Modi began a crackdown on NGOs. In Jan. 2022, he stripped nearly 6,000 NGOs of their permits to accept overseas funding as required in FCRA – Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (Inside Development, 13 Jan. 2022).\nOver 20,000 Indian NGOs have lost their FCRA licenses since 2011. On 1 Jan. 2022 India withdrew the licences of 5968 entities including Oxfam India, the Ramakrishna Mission and Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity. This then stops subgrants to smaller agencies, many of which have shuttered up.\nWith pushback, some 70 organizations had their licences restored, including Ramakrishna Mission and Sisters of Charity. Most others did not even try reapplying. Many Christian organizations quit India.\nRamakrishna Mission, Compassion Intl. and World Vision\nRamakrishna Mission survives exposure. Geoffrey Falk (2016) in Stripping the Gurus: Sex, Violence, Abuse and Enlightenment dissects Ramkarishna saying he had large breasts (gynecomastia) and menstruated. Relatives gifted him “feminine outfits and gold ornaments, to suit his own relatively feminine body.”\nThe story about Ramakrishna’s abuses of power begins with Swami Vivekananda’s lectures at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893. Ramakrishna would suckle his male devotees posing as their girlfriend or mother and always touched or caressed them lovingly (Narendra Sil, 1998). After meeting his foremost disciple, Vivekananda, for the first time, in the throes of an “agonizing desire” to see the young man again, Ramakrishna confessed:\nI ran to the northern quarter of the garden, a rather unfrequented place, and there cried at the top of my voice, “O my darling, come back to me! I can’t live without seeing you!” […] There were other boys who also came here; I felt greatly drawn towards some of them but nothing like the way I was attracted toward [Vivekananda] (Sil 1998, Disciples, 1979)\nSimilarly, A. Roland In his JSTOR article (that won many awards as Indians and Columbia students wanted it banned) “Ramakrishna: Mystical, Erotic, or Both?” in Springer (37(1), 1998), studying Jeffrey Kripals’s 1995 book Kali’s Child says that “Ramakrishna, the most revered nineteenth-century spiritual teacher in India, was a conflicted, tormented homosexual, sexually abused by his temple patron, gurus and others. Of them Swami Vivekananda, became world-renowned.”\nDespite such exposés, the Ramakrishna mission failed to disappear.\nGiven the hostility of India’s pro-Hindu Modi, a major Christian organization, Compassion International, shuttered up on 15 March 2017. World Vision whose FCRA licence was suspended in Nov. 2022, battles on, relying on 28,000 internal donors.\nImpact on Sri Lanka: Christian Corruption\nForeign donor funds have since been diverted here. Funding develops loyalty to churches giving free lunches and employing the unqualified. The freechurches have poor congregations, and are almost fully foreign-funded, retaining absolute congregational loyalty to their illiterate Pastors. Congregations and clergy generally lack our OLs but some boast of Indian doctorates, and get extensive foreign travel.\nMinistry Watch, a respected reporter on Christian Ministry (12 April 2023) terms Compassion International’s partner Hillsong Churches as “Scandal Plagued,” accusing Compassion of egregious spending and of not promoting child sponsorship for which funds were raised. Compassion International in exchange for $1 million a year raised for children, has a contract with Hillsong Churches that offers perqs to Compassion executives. US tax investigators have raided Compassion affiliates’ offices to see if the organization was funding religious conversion.\nThe contract also states that Hillsong and Compassion would work together to provide field exposure trips for Hillsong leaders, the worship team, and other key team members. “Costs for such trips, including videography will be paid by Compassion,” it said. However, Ministry Watch observes corporate sponsorship is not a donation but a questionable business agreement.\nThere are now Singapore-, US- and Scotland- funded new free churches for Pastors Vijeyenthiran (Reformed Presbyterian) in Jaffna and his brother Partheepan in Mullaitheevu. From these sources and Holland, funds flow for land, apartments, and big cars to Jaffna, Mannar, Trincomalee, Thambalakamam, Batticaloa and the hill-country. A Rs.110-lakh van gifted to a church in Trinco is written in the Pastor’s name.\nMembership is growing. Naturally!\nUniversities Spreading Illiteracy\nWorldwide, administrators are taking over education. Now the determining factor is employability (Economist, 8 April 2023). Culturally valuable subjects are down, particularly English, history, philosophy and theology. Educatonal management, after admitting many unqualified people into challenging fields to keep up budgets, also posit that if an admitted student fails, it is the instructor’s fault. Combined, the unfit pass.\nTheology without Accountability\nThe biblical imperative to tithe (10% of income) keeps funds flowing into western churches. Despite falling western church attendance, tithes are steady because those who tithe do not quit church. Tithes continue flowing abroad.\nLocal Born-Agains from foreign funds give a full salary to their assistant pastors whom the foreign-funded colleges are forced to admit. They go back to their churches every weekend and even midweek to evangelize as required by board-members despite written college discipline rules. Theology standards drop. Pastors graduating claim national degree status.\nIn a free-church, Grace Church Mannar, the Pastor from Uyilankulam returned without a degree after years abroad on scholarship. His Grace Church friends got him on to a College Board without elections as President of the degree-granting College although he was an academic flop.\nAt another Mannar church, Grace and Truth Fellowship, the Pastor who as full-time College Principal (and continuing as Grace Church Pastor) got scholarships for his Assistant Pastors for supposed fulltime study, was authorized salary and loans constitutionally disallowed for Board Members by the nondegreed Uyilankulam Grace Church Pastor, now his College President, and predecessors.\nThe Uyilankulm nondegreed Pastor effectively pilfered money as an unelected College President, while paying his friend, the salaried Principal (who was also Treasurer and Board Member and was therefore constitutionally disallowed a salary). This was facilitated by ensuring that all other Board Members were, despite the constitution, unelected and from his Grace Churches (headquartered in Wellawatte) controlling other Grace Churches throughout the North-East. Pastor Suresh “the Archbishop” of Grace Churches was an invited counsellor to the College Board when the college was swindled. Raghavan Alphonsus, then of Save the Children, also had some involvement.\nThe Uyilamkulam Pastor received large remuneration as Pastor. He gets more, coordinating Compassion Lanka projects and running Nambikay Farm in Mannar funded through his sister-in-law (s-i-l) Jakolien’s Dutch organization. He would be taxable if his combined income exceeds Rs. 100,000.\nA Swiss engineer helping the nondegreed Pastor-President pointed out a 15% gap between material received for a new Conference Hall and material invoiced. Jakolien ignored the shortfall for years when her b-i-l was College President – until the management changed in a Dec. 2018 election. As the thefts came to light after Jakolien’s b-i-l and Pastor-College President and his friend the Grace Church Co-Pastor-Principal were displaced, she queried the theft.\nThe Pastor-Principal did not repay his unlawful loan when he was forced out by the new Board. He runs three projects with Rs. 40,000 – 80,000 per Director or Coordinating Pastor say his folk.\nAt one church, there were 3 Compassion projects with church people employed at Rs. 40,000-80,000 per month says a senior Pastor. Millions are involved.\nAs Baptist Canadian Mission pumps an already funded skills training centre in Lindulla, explosive battles are raging over funds and authority, say students.\nA church in Boswell Place, Colombo 6 bought with foreign funds was sold to a builder friend of the Reformed Pastor and brother who demolished an 8-year-old chapel and were gifted an apartment complex there by the builder! It is believed that the vast wealth accrued by the sale is kept in bank accounts. The apartments are now rented at close to Rs. 200,000 a month. There is no evidence of taxes paid.\nEarlier it was nondenominational churches that had one man shows with no accounting. Now corruption is spreading to mainline churches with a subscription base. The Methodist Church in Kilinochchi took Compassion funds for projects under the Minister’s wife and several relatives. Being a mainline church there is some order and the Minister has been transferred. The America-Ceylon Mission also has large Compassion projects.\nInquiry into Corruption\nCompassion International Lanka and other foreign churches and organizations, need to be transparent in their annual reports about the multiple projects handled by Pastors and churches, the number employed and emoluments, every income source, and whether they are getting payments for their family members. Even if disclosed, their illiterate congregations cannot understand annual reports, especially if in English as they usually are when existing.\nHefty church salaries, benefits, use of money given to the poor stored in banks and rents on Colombo owned apartment and whether declared and duly taxed, are unknowns that foreign sponsors and recipients need to be forced to disclose.\nIf not, the donating foreign churches should be kicked out of Sri Lanka. Even as these donors corrupted us, they themselves were corrupted as they supported corrupt nepotism through their official Jakolien, her b-i-l as nondegreed College President giving fake degrees, and allowing their funds to be used without accounting. The Grace Churches have much to account for.\nWith large funds involved, corruption is easy like when Anglican bishops with staff polished in administration took prohibited money in millions from endowments and got their auditors to approve it. (A retired Anglican priest has written widely to ask for forensic audits of the most recent three Anglican Bishops’ personal bank accounts).So this article itself with lawyers, accountants and auditors good at helping do bad will make it easy to move money and hide shortcomings.\nFree-church Pastors have always cultivated politicians to help overcome potential inquiries. Before the recent elections they cultivated SLPP politicians like Kapila Athukorala. He has taken Rs. 504,000, violating the limits set by “Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act” (Island, 11 Feb. 2025). Nebulous friends will rarely want any inquiry of anyone.\nClean free-church pastors say that persons like Pastor Selvarajah Jeyakanth and many from Trinco have close NPP connections so there can be no viable inquiry.\nTo this government that has promised to cleanup and is doing that to its credit, the challenge is to ensure that they do not allow people excusing corruption into their corridors of power and their counsel.\nChristianity of the Trump brand has invaded us. Our Christianity is being corrupted by foreign funded born-again Pastors sustained in corruption from within. Even once good mainline churches like the Anglican, charismatic Pentecostal and Reformed Churches are susceptible through widespread corruption. The more financially self-sustaining churches seem to escape because their leaders cannot be bought.",

    "text": "The rain did not succeed in dispersing the citizens from Independence Square who were determined to feel and repeat the New Year's Eve in Podgorica. Some visitors were happy to close their umbrellas and indulge in the music and the rain, while the restaurateurs from the cottages thought of those in need of shelter. Thus, they spread umbrellas, under which visitors gathered drinks and food. The first evening of the new year was marked by the performance of musician Tina Džankić, after which the Highway band performed, playing foreign, domestic and regional hits. After them, Bane Nedović performed, who started and ended the two-hour performance with the national anthem of Podgorica. \"The impressions are wonderful, we enjoyed ourselves on stage. Our city is the most beautiful in the world and we have to love it. When five, ten or 15 people come to the concert, a thousand people, it's irrelevant. The important thing is that they enjoy themselves as they did tonight,\" says Nedović for Media Bureau. The citizens point out that it was worth coming, and that it is important to support Montenegrin music creators. Even on the first evening of January, there were foreigners at Trg Nezavisnosti, who said that they were comfortable in Podgorica and that they were impressed by the music program. The capital has also prepared a full-day program for today. Apart from the Independence Square, the houses and the music stage are on the squares of Bećir-bey Osmanagić in the Old Town and St. Petar Cetinjski. Bonus video:",

As confirmed on its official Steam page, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC will require to link their PlayStation Network account. The game is, of course, a purely single-player experience (including the remaster’s roguelike mode No Return), but as with other Sony titles on PC of late, it will come with the PSN overlay and support for Trophies.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is due out for PC on April 3 .

    "title": "Moncloa minimiza el \"somos imprescindibles\" de Podemos: \"Necesitan protagonismo\"",
    "text": "Podemos quiere reinterpretarse. Busca un resquicio para volver a condicionar la política de un país que ya estuvo parcialmente bajo su dominio. Entre los mandos del partido morado crece el sentimiento de la rebeldía primigenia de esta formación y, sabedores del escaso margen que ofrece el Congreso, reivindican su perfil propio y la potencia de sus cuatro votos que asumen como “imprescindibles” para traducirlos en una posición de fuerza al más puro estilo Junts. Sin embargo, desde Moncloa optan por minimizar su postura de máximos y reducirla a un afán de protagonismo para sacar de nuevo la cabeza a la izquierda del PSOE.\nLos morados, ahora en el Grupo Mixto, empiezan a ser plenamente conscientes del potencial que pueden tener en esta legislatura. Las mayorías aguantan a tientas sobre el filo de la navaja, siempre con la amenaza de caer en cualquier momento. Podemos construyó un discurso contestatario al Gobierno desde su salida del Grupo Plurinacional, pero con el tiempo ha ido puliéndolo hasta llegar a la consulta propuesta esta misma semana.\nCuatro votos \"imprescindibles\"\nLa líder del partido, Ione Belarra, flanqueada por el resto de la dirección, convocó una consulta a las bases ideada para fortalecer su posicionamiento. Al menos así lo conciben en el fuero de la formación, que consideran que ahora sí tienen las “manos libres” a la hora de delimitar sus posiciones, habida cuenta de que no conforman el bloque de socios de la coalición. De hecho, se han encargado de desmarcarse desde el inicio, llevando según qué negociaciones al límite.\nPor ahí van los tiros del reacondicionamiento del partido en este último año. Una especie de regreso a los orígenes, con un discurso más duro contra el Partido Socialista, resucitando la idea del bipartidismo como eje de todos los males. Relato que, por otro lado, busca equiparar a sus antiguos socios con el Partido Popular. Posicionamiento de máximos que previsiblemente se verá reforzado por las bases del partido en la consulta, pero no sólo de cara al exterior, sino también en la negociación con el propio PSOE.\nCreen que demandas tales como la intervención del precio de los alquileres, así como la ruptura de relaciones con Israel son plenamente asumibles para cualquier formación que se precie de izquierdas. La propia Belarra lo ha advertido durante toda esta semana: “Seremos muy firmes”. El objetivo no es sino replicar la estrategia que siguió Junts con la ley de amnistía. Así lo explican en privado altos dirigentes morados: si el PSOE acabó aceptando el sapo de Puigdemont, deberían hacer lo propio con sus dos principales condicionantes. En resumen, lo que vale para los neoconvergentes, también tiene su ámbito de aplicación en los “votos de izquierdas”.\nContexto de debilidad\nEstas mismas fuentes abundan que el Ejecutivo está sumido en una época de crisis. La fortaleza de la coalición no es tal y ven a los socialistas en una posición de debilidad. No aceptarán el discurso del PSOE de que es “imposible”, porque también lo era la amnistía. Con esta maniobra lo que buscan es conseguir un hito un contexto donde las movilizaciones de vivienda y Koldo hacen mella en la fachada del Ejecutivo.\nLa secretaria general de Podemos también ha apuntado en esta dirección desde los micrófonos de Radiocable este jueves. Belarra, que tuvo un agrio enfrentamiento con la ministra de Vivienda en el Pleno del miércoles, cree que el PSOE está “nervioso” porque saben que “van en serio” con sus exigencias para negociar los Presupuestos Generales del Estado. “No aceptan que haya una izquierda a su izquierda que le plante cara, que vaya más allá de los límites del PSOE y que responda a sus votantes, no a las presiones del PSOE”, resume la líder de los morados.\nPodemos imputa cierta “exaltación” a Isabel Rodríguez cuando ésta aseguró que con el alquiler de sus tres viviendas no podría pagar la mitad del chalé de Galapagar. Golpe directo a Pablo Iglesias que Belarra lo interpreta como una representación del “nerviosismo” que se respira en Ferraz y Moncloa porque son conscientes de que los morados están dispuestos a hacer valer su ‘sí’ a los Presupuestos a cambio de la ruptura con Israel y la reducción por ley de los alquileres un 40%.\nLa líder del partido es consciente de que la “operación Sumar” les dejó “muy debilitadas”, pero ha advertido que no será obstáculo para “dejar de hacer política” o usar sus cuatro votos “imprescindibles” para “mejorar la vida de la gente”. De hecho, ha recordado que ya facilitaron “gratis” la investidura de Pedro Sánchez. Favor, dicen, que no volverá a ocurrir. De hecho, en su plan por convertirse en el Junts de la izquierda, asumen incluso su narrativa y advierten de que si Moncloa acepta sus requisitos podrán “sobrevivir”.\nAfán de “protagonismo”\nPese a las amenazas, en Moncloa no terminan de tomarse en serio el nuevo papel de Podemos. Algunas voces del Ejecutivo comentan en privado que sus exigencias responden a la necesidad de “protagonismo político”, por lo que esperan que impere el sentido común a la hora de negociar y supriman condiciones que son inviables, como la imposición por ley de la rebaja de los alquileres.\nEstas mismas voces imputan, además, un diagnóstico erróneo en las filas moradas al plantear requisitos de este calado al partir de la creencia de que no habrá mayoría suficiente para aprobar las cuentas. Sobre todo porque en Moncloa creen que aún queda mucha tela que cortar como para acastillarse en una postura tan poco comprensible.\nPor ello, resuelven que las demandas de Podemos no responden si no a la necesidad de sacar la cabeza en el espacio a su izquierda y marcar perfil propio tras la ruptura con Sumar. No contemplan, por tanto, un escenario en el que los morados se desmarquen del ‘sí’ del bloque de la investidura en una votación presupuestaria, enfatizando su firme posicionamiento de izquierda. Así las cosas, relativizan los golpes en el pecho de sus antiguos socios de gobierno y esperan que acabe imponiéndose el sentido común.",

    "title": "December jobs report: Wages up, hiring steady as job market ends year strong",
    "text": "7:06\nNews Story\nThe health care industry continues to add jobs, in part because of the U.S.’s aging population. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\nFriday’s jobs data showed a strong, resilient U.S. labor market with wages outpacing inflation — welcome news for Americans hoping to have more purchasing power in 2024.\nThe December jobs report unveiled another unemployment rate below 4%, as it has for two years, at 3.7%, the same as it was for November. The economy added 216,000 jobs, many of which were concentrated in health care, local government, construction and social assistance, which includes child care, social workers and home care aides,\naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nDemocrats celebrated the news and took it as an opportunity to voice their frustrations with Republicans as policymakers grapple with another possible government shutdown over\nU.S.-Mexico border policy and other issues. Congress has deadlines of Jan. 19 for four government spending bills and Feb. 2 for eight government spending bills.\nPresident Joe Biden\nstated on Friday morning that the jobs data “confirms that 2023 was a great year for American workers.\n“The strong job creation continued even as inflation fell to the pre-pandemic level of 2 percent over the last six months …,” he added.\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, touted the strong jobs report and stated, “Now is not the time to reverse our progress on the economy. I remain committed to opposing any effort that gambles with the lives of everyday Americans in order to engage in political grandstanding.”\nEconomists and data analysts provided States Newsroom with their takeaways on key news in the report, from wages to job growth in healthcare.\nWage growth and cooling inflation provide relief\nWages are outpacing inflation, with average hourly earnings increasing by 15 cents and rising by 4.1% over the past year, well over\n3.1% inflation. With inflation coming down fairly quickly, wages are solidly above inflation, economists said.\nMoody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said wage growth is now firmly above the rate of inflation, which means people’s real purchasing power is improving.\n“They got creamed back in 2021 and particularly in 2022 when inflation outpaced wages,” Zandi said. “And I think that’s one reason why people are so uncomfortable with their financial position, but that’s improving now and improving very quickly as wage growth remains strong and firm and inflation is lower and continues to moderate.”\nElise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, added that lower wage workers in particular have seen that increased purchasing power for longer.\n“For the last six months, the average hourly earnings for private sector workers has been beating inflation so their purchasing power has increased and on average, over the last few months, we also know from other data that lower wage workers have been seeing stronger wage growth,” she said. “They’ve been beating inflation for a lot longer. Overall, the purchasing power has certainly been increasing as inflation has been coming down faster.”\nHealth care and government continue to add jobs\nThe government workforce grew by 52,000 people with the majority of those jobs — 37,000 — in local governments. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average gains of jobs per month in 2023 was more than double the average for job growth in 2022.\nGould said there still seems to be room for government employment to continue to grow.\n“We still have a lot of catching up to do there because when we think about government employment, it has not kept up with population growth in any way,” she said. “You would think that the services that are being provided by the government would need to grow even more. So I think there’s a fair amount of room there that we are not back to normal in that sense.”\nHealth care also continues to see job growth, which Gould expects to continue partly because of the U.S.’s aging population. Health care jobs rose by 38,000 in December. Ambulatory health care services and hospitals added 19,000 jobs and 15,000 jobs, respectively.\nZandi sees these sectors as mostly playing catchup after the private sector crowded out some of these jobs during the recovery by offering higher pay.\n“Private businesses were willing to pay up big wage increases to hold on to workers and hire new ones,” he said. “And that was impossible for local governments or for hospitals to keep up with. But now that the private sector is fully recovered, we’re now starting to see these other sectors be able to hire again, find workers and bring them on the payrolls.”\nEconomists watch for signs of a slowdown\nEconomists had mixed responses to the changes in the labor force participation rate and employment-population ratio, which both fell 0.3% percentage point in December. The labor force participation rate sheds light on the economy through the percentage of working age people in the labor force, which includes both those actively seeking work and people who are currently employed. The employment-population ratio shows the number of people employed as part of the working age population.\nGould said she’s watching this data closely to see whether these changes are a source for concern but she says it’s important to keep in mind that unemployment is still very low.\n“Is that just volatility in the series or is there something to watch for?” she said. “…It’s not indicative of some huge problem but it’s something we want to keep watching. I didn’t like the drop in employment, particularly prime-age employment and participation is soft.”\nZandi said it’s hard to read too much into any month-to-month change in this data yet but that the labor market is slowing down a bit.\n“I think the general pattern in the data shows that the job market is resilient, continues to create lots of jobs, and unemployment remains low. But it is throttling back. Job growth is definitively slowing and other measures of the strength of the labor market are, are moderating. You’re seeing fewer hours of work and temp employment is declining,” he said.\nOn the labor force participation rate, Zandi said he suspects that participation is not going to continue to rise.\n“Boomers are retiring en masse and that’s going to wash out any increase in participation by other groups. Broadly speaking, I think the report is consistent with an economy that remains strong but is slow and consistent with getting inflation back to something we all feel comfortable with,” he said.\nTrends in state pay\nData\nreleased by ADP, a payroll processing firm, on Thursday, confirmed Zandi’s view on a cooling labor market as pay increases for people staying at their jobs were down in December from November. ADP’s median year-over-year pay change was higher in states such as Montana, where pay shot up 8.2% and Idaho, where pay rose 7.5%. New Mexico and Arizona also had higher increases in pay compared to many other states at 6.7% and 6.2%. Washington, Oregon, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota also had pay growth over that time period.\nLiv Wang, lead data scientist at the ADP Research Institute, told States Newsroom that ADP saw higher pay growth for lower-paid workers during the recovery.\nWang added in an email, “….some of the states with higher percentage increases in pay have lower median pay levels. This is true for some states in both the Northwest and Southwest. This same trend also applies to the Leisure and Hospitality industry, which has been leading pay increases. However more broadly, pay gains have slowed down recently and the pay premium for changing jobs has been falling.”\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

    "text": "As descobertas podem ter um impacto importante principalmente ao abrir um novo caminho para novas e mais eficazes terapias contra o Alzheimer. — Foto: Epoca Negocios Pesquisadores da Universidade de Columbia, nos Estados Unidos, identificaram uma nova variante genética que foi associada a uma redução em até 70% no risco de indivíduos com predisposição desenvolverem a doença de Alzheimer, forma mais comum de demência. Segundo os cientistas, apenas nos EUA milhares de pessoas podem estar protegidas do diagnóstico graças à mutação.\nEles explicam que a variante parece estar ligada a uma maior capacidade do indivíduo de eliminar formas tóxicas da proteína amiloide do cérebro por meio da barreira hematoencefálica. O acúmulo dessa proteína forma placas no órgão e é considerado uma das poucas causas conhecidas do Alzheimer.\nVeja Mais A barreira hematoencefálica é uma estrutura permeável que reveste o sistema nervoso central e, de maneira resumida, regula o transporte de substâncias entre o sangue e o cérebro, evitando, por exemplo, a entrada de agentes tóxicos.\nDe acordo com os cientistas, esse achado pode levar a um novo caminho no desenvolvimento de terapias que simulem a ação da mutação genética e utilizem a barreira para evitar a formação das placas amiloides, tanto para prevenir, como para tratar a doença. O trabalho foi publicado na revista científica Acta Neuropathologica.\nA variante foi identificada no FN1, um gene que produz a fibronectina, uma proteína presente na barreira hematoencefálica em baixas quantidades, porém de forma mais abundante em pacientes com Alzheimer.\n\"É um caso clássico de uma coisa boa em excesso. Isso nos fez pensar que o excesso de fibronectina poderia estar impedindo a eliminação dos depósitos de amiloide do cérebro”, diz Caghan Kizil, líder do estudo e professor de Ciências Neurológicas da Universidade de Columbia, em comunicado.\nCom um peixe-zebra com um modelo do Alzheimer, animal muito utilizado em estudos que simulam o corpo humano, os pesquisadores confirmaram essa hipótese e observaram que uma redução na fibronectina presente na barreira de fato aumentava a limpeza da amiloide no cérebro e reduzia outros danos biológicos ligados à doença.\nJá com a ideia em mente de que a atuação no gene que produz fibronectina poderia ser um novo alvo terapêutico, os cientistas começaram então a investigar se haveria alguma mutação genética em seres humanos que naturalmente impedisse o acúmulo da fibronectina e consequentemente o das placas amiloides do Alzheimer.\nPara isso, eles analisaram sequenciamentos do código genético de centenas de americanos acima de 70 anos que carregavam uma outra mutação genética APOEe4. Isso porque essa conhecida variante aumenta significativamente o risco de Alzheimer, em até duas a três vezes. Então, eles decidiram investigar o DNA das chamadas “pessoas resilientes”, aquelas que carregam o APOEe4, mas não desenvolvem a doença, para procurar um efeito protetor.\n“Elas podem nos dizer muito sobre a doença e quais fatores genéticos e não genéticos podem proporcionar proteção. Nossa hipótese era que essas pessoas resilientes podem ter outras variantes genéticas que as protegem do APOEe4”, explica Badri N. Vardarajan, professor de Ciências Neurológicas em Columbia e especialista no uso de abordagens computacionais para descobrir genes da doença de Alzheimer.\nA estratégia levou os cientistas a identificarem a variante no gene FN1. O achado foi ainda confirmado por outros pesquisadores das universidades de Stanford e Washington, em coortes distintas de pacientes com o APOEe4: aqueles com predisposição ao Alzheimer de fato eram protegidos pela mutação no FN1, que por sua vez regulava a produção da fibronectina.\nAo todo, as duas análises envolveram 11 mil participantes, o que possibilitou dados mais completos que apontaram ainda uma estimativa de que, entre os pacientes com APOEe4, a variante recém-descoberta reduz em até 71% os riscos de ter o Alzheimer. Entre os que ainda assim desenvolvem a doença, adia em cerca de quatro anos o diagnóstico.\nAlém disso, os pesquisadores estimaram que de 1% a 3% dos indivíduos que carregam o APOEe4 têm a mutação protetora, o que compreende entre 200 mil e 620 mil americanos. Mas Kizil destaca que não são apenas aqueles com o APOEe4 que podem estar mais protegidos:\n“Há uma diferença significativa nos níveis de fibronectina na barreira hematoencefálica entre indivíduos cognitivamente saudáveis e aqueles com doença de Alzheimer, independentemente de seu status APOEe4\", diz.\nPotencial terapêutico\nPara o pesquisador, as descobertas podem ter um impacto importante principalmente ao abrir um novo caminho para novas e mais eficazes terapias contra o Alzheimer.\n\"Qualquer coisa que reduza o excesso de fibronectina deve proporcionar alguma proteção, e um medicamento que faça isso pode ser um avanço significativo na luta contra essa doença debilitante”, afirma.\nHoje, os tratamentos mais avançados são anticorpos que eliminam as placas amiloides do cérebro, porém eles têm pouco efeito clínico: apenas retardam, e pouco, o declínio cognitivo. Os remédios também são pouco acessíveis, têm custos elevados e levam ao risco de provocar quadros de hemorragia graves durante a aplicação, que é injetável.\nMais recente Próxima Cientistas desenvolvem novo super-antibiótico eficaz contra bactérias multirresistentes",

    "text": "The ChatGPT Pro subscription, which grants access to the advanced GPT-4 model, has rapidly gained traction worldwide, especially in India. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Rakesh Kumar Updated on: 10 Jan 2025, 8:01 am 2 min read\nCopied\nNEW DELHI: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently shared a surprising admission on X (formerly Twitter) about the company’s financial difficulties surrounding ChatGPT Pro subscriptions.\nAltman stated: “Insane thing: we are currently losing money on OpenAI Pro subscriptions! People use it much more than we expected.” This revelation has raised questions about the sustainability of OpenAI’s pricing model for its popular ChatGPT Pro service.\nPro and its popularity\nThe ChatGPT Pro subscription, which grants access to the advanced GPT-4 model, has rapidly gained traction worldwide, especially in India. At $200 per month (roughly ₹17,000), the Pro subscription offers professionals, businesses, and students significant benefits, such as faster response times, priority access during peak hours, and advanced GPT-4 capabilities. These features make it an attractive option for those seeking to improve productivity and creativity.\nIrony: Financial strain of increased usage\nDespite the strong uptake, Altman’s comments highlight a major challenge: usage levels have far exceeded OpenAI's initial projections. The high demand for Pro subscriptions has led to unsustainable operational costs. The GPT-4 model, like other large language models, requires vast amounts of computational power, which leads to escalating cloud computing and server costs. While the Pro subscription was designed to help offset these costs, the surge in usage has made it difficult for OpenAI to maintain profitability.\nBalancing accessibility with sustainability\nAltman’s admission shines a light on the difficult balancing act that tech companies must navigate between offering powerful, accessible tools and ensuring financial sustainability. OpenAI’s goal to democratize AI access through affordable pricing for Pro subscriptions is now facing scrutiny as the company grapples with the unexpected rise in operational costs.\nIndia: A key market for ChatGPT\nIndia has emerged as a significant market for ChatGPT, with professionals across education, IT, and content creation increasingly adopting the Pro subscription to enhance their work processes and efficiency. The affordable pricing in India compared to global rates has contributed to the widespread popularity of ChatGPT Pro among Indian users.\nWhat’s next for OpenAI?\nAltman’s comments have sparked considerable curiosity about OpenAI’s next steps, particularly as the company faces these financial challenges. This curiosity has only intensified after Altman’s recent prediction that AI could replace humans in many jobs by 2025, adding further complexity to the conversation about AI's role in the workforce.\nAs OpenAI navigates its financial hurdles, it will need to find a way to balance its mission of providing accessible AI tools with the reality of high operational costs. The future of ChatGPT and other OpenAI products could hinge on the company's ability to address these challenges while maintaining its vision of democratising artificial intelligence.",
