    "text": "The hunt for a New York City apartment has gone from frustrating to downright feral.\nThis summer, renters are battling it out like never before, all for a shot at a roof over their heads in a city where landlords are calling the shots and jacking up prices to astronomical levels.\nTake Aurielle Catron, a 29-year-old security engineer who braved the NYC jungle in search of a two-bedroom in Bushwick. After a brutal month-long search and 52 viewings, Catron landed a rent-stabilized fourth-floor walk-up for $3,200 a month.\nIt wasn’t her dream pad — it’s missing a laundry room and elevator — but after losing a bidding war that saw a $2,800 unit shoot up to $3,600, she was just relieved to have a place to call home.\n5 Bidding wars for rentals are now common in the Big Apple, with landlords using aggressive tactics to maximize profits. Christopher Sadowski “People are willing to say, ‘Hey, if you give me this apartment, I’ll pay like $200, $500, $600 over asking for rent,’” she told Bloomberg , which reported on today’s general rental scramble. “I can’t compete with that.”\nExplore More How the ultra-rich are souping up their high-tech bunkers for the end times Inside the world's most luxurious motorhome — a $2.5M megamansion on wheels Here's who bought La Dune in Southampton, which once asked $150M, at auction for $88.48M in cash But it’s not just about losing bids. For Amber Melhouse, 49, the stakes were even higher. Forced out of her Brooklyn pad when the landlord hiked the rent by $1,350 a month — too much for her to handle after a divorce — Melhouse’s search for a smaller place turned into a horror show.\nAt one studio viewing, she showed up half an hour early, only to find a line of four people ahead of her and a swarm forming behind her. The place was snatched up before she even had a chance to apply. Now she’s crashing with friends, considering giving up her small pet-care business, and wondering if she’ll have to leave New York altogether.\n“I feel like this whole apartment-hunt experience has been a test of whether I’m meant to stay in New York. Like, is this New York’s way of kicking me out?” Melhouse told the outlet. “I don’t want to leave because my whole life is here.”\n5 Renters like Aurielle Catron and Matthew Braganza are struggling to find apartments, often having to compromise on location and amenities, or putting together extensive personal profiles just to be considered. Christopher Sadowski This savage rental market isn’t just a collection of horror stories — it’s the grim reality for thousands of New Yorkers this summer. Bidding wars, outrageous rents and lines of desperate apartment hunters snaking around the block are the new normal. It already has been for several years.\nAccording to Jonathan Miller, president of appraisal firm Miller Samuel, the tables turned in favor of landlords right after the pandemic.\n“Landlords resumed control and landlords could dictate terms that were more and more favorable for them,” he said.\nIn fact, some of these tactics are straight-up dirty tricks. Real estate agents are stoking bidding wars by underpricing apartments, pulling in hordes of hopefuls to open houses and then picking the highest bidder or the tenant with the best financials.\n“There’s too many TikTok brokers now that are trying to do things to go viral,” Douglas Elliman agent Keyan Sanai told Bloomberg. “At the end of the day, we’re in the business of sales. But 80% of the rental market competition is real.”\n5 Long lines and bidding wars have been hallmarks of the New York rental market since the days following COVID. Bloomberg via Getty Images This summer, with recent grads flooding the market and mortgage rates so high that even the thought of homeownership is off the table, renters are in a pressure cooker.\nFor some, like Cornell grad Matthew Braganza, the search for a pad became more grueling than the hunt for a job.\nDespite landing a solid accounting gig, Braganza had to jump through hoops — like providing personal references, his LinkedIn profile and a cover letter — just to stand out from the pack. After seeing nearly 100 apartments, he gave up on living solo and is now sharing a Lower East Side place with three roommates.\n“I had a harder time finding an apartment than I did finding a job,” Braganza said. “It felt like I was competing with a million people.”\n5 Bidding wars are at an all-time high, with 24% of new Manhattan leases and 28.2% of Brooklyn deals turning into fierce battles for the highest bid. Helayne Seidman Agents like Compass’s Thomas Hollingsworth are taking full advantage of the desperation. For applicants with thin rental histories or limited income, he’s demanding college transcripts.\n“If you were an A student, we are much more likely to trust that you will be successful in your job and able to pay your rent,” Hollingsworth said. “If you were a dropout or got all Ds, we’re going to be much more cautious.”\nAnd don’t think for a second that the bidding wars are entirely organic. Some brokers are playing dirty, holding back-to-back open houses and booking appointments just minutes apart, creating a frenzy that drives rents even higher.\nColdwell Banker Warburg’s Bill Kowalczuk admitted that these tactics almost always push offers above the asking price. It’s the kind of strategy that’s making New York’s “Wild West” market more chaotic than ever.\n5 According to Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, landlords have regained control and are now dictating terms that heavily favor them. Getty Images The rent madness hit new heights in June when bidding wars exploded in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with nearly a quarter of new leases in both boroughs caught up in the frenzy.\nHollingsworth himself put up a “basic” $2,000 fourth-floor walk-up studio in central Manhattan on Second Avenue that brought in 100 people and 20 applicants, eventually leasing to someone who offered $2,075 and was “generally pleasant” to work with.\nAn applicant who bid just $25 more but proved difficult to deal with was passed over, sparing the landlord from a potentially troublesome tenant, Hollingsworth said.",

    "text": "How to Create Faux Grass Cloth Walls Create the timeless look of a grass cloth wall treatment using this simple paint-and-brush technique to simulate the real thing — at a fraction of the cost. Grass cloth has been used as wallcoverings in Asian homes dating back as far as the first century. Traditional grass cloth was made of natural materials such as silks, grasses, bamboo and hemp. Because of its unique texture and history, grass cloth stands apart as both organic and luxurious. Grass cloth wallpaper is timeless and never goes out of style. It is again growing in popularity as a way to add texture and dimension to a room or feature wall. Its downside is that it is expensive to purchase, difficult to clean and requires a degree of skill to install properly. However, using standard wall paint, glaze and a special brush, you can mimic the look and create the upscale organic vibes of traditional grass cloth, with the added bonus of being able to choose any color. Tools and Materials: - paint - paint roller [clear mixing glaze](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Valspar-Clear-Satin-Water-based-Clear-Glaze/1000380325) [weaver brush](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Marshalltown/5003418901?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-lwn-_-ggl-_-PLA_LWN_127_Cleaning-_-5003418901-_-online-_-0-_-0&gclid=CjwKCAjwv8qkBhAnEiwAkY-ahjANGcFg4JkbqkWawej2mrSYLycjvJHtolaHdbwy04m1JFFLHZVqAxoCKEEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - painter’s tape - measuring tape - level 1. Mix the Paint Pour clear mixing glaze into paint at a ratio of two parts paint to one part glaze. Stir well. 2. Divide Wall Into Sections Painted grass cloth walls mimic the look of wallpaper, so first divide the wall into 3-foot (or even) sections. Use a measuring tape and a level to mark vertical lines. You will be working one section at a time and will be painting every other section. Apply painter’s tape to the outside of each mark based on the sections you will be painting first. 3. Paint Use a standard paint roller to apply paint to the wall. Work quickly and do not allow the paint to dry. Cover the entire first section to the painter’s tape. 4. Brush Wall Grab your weaver brush. Hold the brush vertically at the upper left-hand corner of the section and drag the brush horizontally across the paint, creating fine lines. Use a steady, slightly firm pressure. Repeat this motion down the entire height of the wall, overlapping each row slightly over the row above. Then, starting in the upper left-hand corner again, hold the brush horizontally and drag down the length of the wall. Work across the wall, again slightly overlapping each row. 5. Repeat the Process Skip one section and repeat the entire process in the third section. Work from the upper left to the lower right on this section as well. Let painted sections dry overnight. 6. Paint Skipped Sections Gently remove the painter’s tape and ensure the paint is completely dry. Apply painter’s tape just over the painted edge (if the paint has not dried completely, you risk the tape pulling the paint from the wall.) Repeat the painting process. Let dry completely before removing the tape. 7. Admire Your New Walls Elevating your style with added texture doesn’t have to be difficult and this simple project proves it. Grass cloth adds a unique, organic vibe to any space with only small investments of both time and money. Jennie Andrews Jennie Andrews",

    "text": "Microsoft taglia altre 650 posizioni dalla divisione gaming: un nuovo 'sacrificio' dopo l'acquisizione di Activision Blizzard, produttore di \"Call of Duty\". L'eliminazione di ruoli principalmente aziendali e di supporto in Microsoft Gaming ha lo scopo di \"organizzare la nostra attività per un successo a lungo termine\" dopo l'acquisizione costata 69 miliardi di dollari, ha detto il capo dell'unità Phil Spencer ai dipendenti in una nota visionata dall'AFP. \"Oggi è uno dei giorni difficili\", ha detto Spencer nella nota. \"So che affrontare altri cambiamenti come questo è dura\".\n Il sindacato Communications Workers of America (CWA), che include membri del settore dei videogiochi, ha definito \"estremamente deludenti\" i licenziamenti che arrivano sulla scia dell'annuncio di 220 licenziamenti da parte della sussidiaria di Sony Interactive Entertainment Bungie a luglio.\n \"Licenziamenti spietati come questi sono diventati fin troppo comuni\", ha detto Samuel Cooper, produttore senior di World of Warcraft e membro della CWA, in un comunicato degli organizzatori sindacali.\nMicrosoft lo scorso gennaio ha licenizato 1.900 persone dalla sua divisione gaming, ovvero l'otto percento del personale, mentre consolidava l'acquisizione di Activision Blizzard.\nSpencer allora disse ai dipendenti che Microsoft e Activision si erano impegnate a trovare una \"struttura dei costi sostenibile\" per far crescere il business del gaming, che impiegava 22.000 persone e includeva la divisione Xbox. Microsoft ha lanciato a gennaio 2022 l'acquisizione che l'ha resa la terza azienda di gaming al mondo per fatturato. Nessun gioco o dispositivo verrà cancellato, né alcun studio verrà chiuso come parte degli \"aggiustamenti\" apportati all'unità gaming di Microsoft, ha assicurato Spencer.\nI licenziamenti sono diventati comuni nel settore dei videogiochi, con Sony PlayStation che all'inizio di quest'anno ha annunciato il taglio dell'otto percento della sua forza lavoro globale. Definendola \"triste notizia\", ;;il capo della PlayStation Jim Ryan ha detto che la riduzione avrebbe interessato 900 persone in tutto il mondo, compresi gli studi di produzione di videogiochi. Lo studio PlayStation London dell'azienda, fondato nel 2002 e specializzato in progetti di gioco in realtà virtuale, è stato chiuso.\nIn totale, l'anno scorso l'industria tecnologica ha perso circa 260.000 posti di lavoro secondo layoffs.fyi, un sito web con sede in California che monitora il settore. Finora quest'anno i licenziamenti sono stati 136.360, scrive il sito, da parte di 435 aziende tecnologiche.",

This occurred as the beleaguered natural gas company outlined significant efforts to stave off its potential bankruptcy.\nTellurian is working to stave off bankruptcy concerns The company has struggled with multiple headwinds in the funding and construction of its massive $25 billion Driftwood Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plant project. Shares plunged in October after the company formally asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to delay the plant's opening by another two years, to 2029.\nTellurian then raised eyebrows in early November by issuing a \"going concern\" warning in its third-quarter report. It pointed out that the $59.3 million in cash reserves on its balance sheet at the end of September wouldn't be sufficient to cover its obligations and fund working capital needs for next year.\nIn a letter to shareholders published Thursday morning, however, Tellurian Chairman Martin Houston noted the company has already made substantial progress since he took the helm three weeks ago. Its moves to improve liquidity and bolster its balance sheet so far include a nearly 50% reduction in general and administrative expenses, a new $37.9 million debt-for-equity swap with its principal lender, and an increased stake (to 7.3% from 5.2%) from institutional investor Chatterjee Fund Management.\nWhat's next for Tellurian investors? Mr. Houston pledged \"to be as open and transparent as we can, with the expectation that this will allow you greater trust in assessing our progress.\"\nThat's all well and good, of course, and it's great to see the company moving aggressively to improve liquidity. Still, Tellurian's \"going concern\" warning still highlights that this is a very high-risk stock with a significant risk of bankruptcy .\nStory continues There might be significant upside for risk-tolerant investors willing to bet Tellurian can climb out of this hole. But with plenty of other healthier natural gas stocks in this market, I'm personally content watching Tellurian's progress from the sidelines.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tellurian right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Tellurian, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Tellurian wasn't one of them.
