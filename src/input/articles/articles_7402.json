    "text": "In a few recent articles, I have drawn attention to the importance of basing our thinking and actions on moral foundations, irrespective of religious or ideological belief, or other value systems. Today, I discuss some war issues, notably the terrible Israel-Palestine War in Gaza. In spite of political and other opinions, we must realise that in the end we are responsible as individuals and groups, and we cannot hide behind anybody.\nAlthough we must, each of us as individuals and groups, take responsibility for what we think, say, and do—even about violent conflicts and wars—we are also products of the time, place, and culture we belong to, the “Zeitgeist” of our time, and more. Particularly important is the religious belief we may have, and the moral values deriving from religion, described in the holy books. Yet, we also know that people of entirely different religions may have similar moral values, or we may discover that other religions than our own have very high, even higher moral standards than we have in our own religion. Also, we know that people who belong to entirely different political parties, based on different ideologies and thinking, still can be influenced by the thinking and moral foundations and standards of people they don’t generally agree with.\nSometimes, we hear that people who are socialists or on the left in politics say that they may find conservatives on the right to be both fair and morally admirable. They wouldn’t agree politically, but they could find in themselves a corner in the heart where they could see the true moral foundations of the policies of the political opponent, building on a liberal openness to people who think differently. Furthermore, we also all have an ‘inner compass’ which tells us what is right and fair, yet, with the limitations that I mentioned above concerning the time, place and culture we grew up and live in. The religious and other associations we belong to, and the environment we are a part of, influence our thinking and actions, often unwittingly to ourselves. But in all this, we are still always responsible as individuals and groups for what we say and do. That means that people in Israel supporting the country’s government, or having direct tasks in the current war, can also be held responsible. The same goes for the Hamas leaders and the Palestinian people. Each person and group is morally responsible.\nLet this be a background for viewing the situation in the Middle East, historically and temporarily, and the ongoing outrageous conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the terrible war in Gaza, now about 20 months old, where the Israeli military has killed some 60,000 people, many children and women, since 7 October 2023. We remember that date in horror. It was when the Gaza-based Hamas carried out the terrible terrorist attack inside Israel, killing close to 1,200 innocent people and injuring many more. About 200 were taken hostage and brought to the underground tunnels in Gaza, where almost 60 persons are still held, but only about 20 are believed to be alive.\nThere is no excuse or justification for the terrible terrorist attack and the hostage-taking with deep suffering of innocent people. Yet, we can understand that it took place, again without excusing it. But it was a result of the decade-long Israeli occupation of Gaza, and the overall treatment of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, and the Israeli state blocking any movement towards a durable two-state solution, or any other peaceful solution acceptable to the Palestinian people, and also the Israelis.\nIt should be underlined that Israel’s revenge for the terrorist attack has gone far beyond what can be termed revenge. Also, the actions are particularly cruel, beyond what can be accepted even in war; recently, food is used more and more as a military weapon. The international community, and the USA in particular, on whose support Israel depends, has shown slow and half-hearted support to reduce the holocaust that goes on. Recently, though, some European countries speak up more clearly in support of the suffering Palestinians. Let us hope it will have some concrete positive impact, not only symbolic, although that is important, too.\nAs we know, major mistakes are made during and after wars and military conflicts, indeed so at the creation of Israel after WWII in 1948, without giving fair treatment of the Palestinian people. The mistakes made by the UK and the West that time cast dark shadows until this time, affecting the Jews and Palestinians, indeed witnessed in the current war in Gaza. Let us pray for the people on both sides of the devastating conflict and ask for a new peaceful era for all children of the “Land of Abraham/Ibrahim”. We should bear in mind that the three religions play an important role in the Israeli and Palestinian land, historically and today, making it more difficult to find peaceful solutions, but it should have made it easier.\nThis year, the major Muslim and Christian events fall about the same time of year, including Ramadan and Lent, ending with Eid-ul-Fitr and Easter. Last weekend, Eid-ul-Azha was marked by Muslims. Whitsun, also called Pentecost, was celebrated by Christians, marking the founding of the Christian Church, and Jesus’ disciples receiving the Holy Spirit, believed to have taken place ten days after Ascension Day when Christians believe that Jesus/Isa ascended into heaven, fifty days after Easter Sunday. Muslims believe ascension to have taken place later. His second coming is described both in the Quran and the Bible. We are reminded of the many similarities between the two world religions, and other religions, too, including Judaism.\nIn the Land of Abraham/Ibrahim, the Jews, Muslims and Christians have many holy sites. There should be peace and harmony among the cousins in faith, not antagonism and war, which is the situation today. The people who live there, and play a direct role in what goes on now, have a special responsibility, religiously, morally and politically. It ought to be possible to allow all to live and worship side by side. Also, people elsewhere in the world should do more to live peacefully and respectfully together, side by side, and hold ecumenical meetings and services.\nLast Sunday, I watched an ecumenical service on the Internet from a small town called Arna outside the city of Bergen on the Norwegian west coast. I found it particularly moving to listen to a Norwegian of Saami ethnicity, a small nomadic minority group living in the far north of the country, traditionally keeping reindeer animals for a living. They have a unique way of singing, monotonous and almost without words, called ‘Joik’ or ‘Yike’, which they developed when they herded their animals for long hours. In earlier times, it was seen as an un-Christian way of singing, part of a heathen tradition. Yet, this Sunday, the ‘Kyrie, Eleison’ liturgical prayer was sung by a young Saami man, and it was easy to recognise the influence of the Saami song tradition. ‘Kyrie, Eleison’ is Greek, meaning ‘God, Have Mercy’. Let that today be our prayer for the Israel-Palestine War and the people on both sides, and the way we all see and talk about the war, and other wars, too. We must search for new and better ways of living peacefully together with people of the same or different religions and cultures, on true moral foundations.\nAtle Hetland\nThe writer is a senior Norwegian social scientist with experience from university, diplomacy and development aid.

    "title": "Martin Pollack: Those against supplying weapons to Ukraine don’t quite understand what pacifism means",
    "text": "Despite the geographical proximity of the two countries — Austria and Ukraine — Austrians know little about Ukraine and don’t quite understand it. Russia’s active “cultural diplomacy” has created the conditions for Austria to view the world through the prism of pro-Russian narratives. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is slowly changing the situation. What can we do to speed up the process? We will discuss this in a conversation with Austrian writer Martin Pollack, author of the books “The Dead Man in the Bunker,” “Contaminated Landscapes”, and “Topography of Remembrance”, which help to interpret World War II. Chytomo: Russia and Austria have long had close political affiliations, and many Austrians still see the situation through the Russian optics. No need to repeat that Austrian politicians were the first to placate Putin after the annexation of Crimea. Martin Pollack: Attitudes in Austria were extremely pro-Russian. That’s true. At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Austrian writer Franzobel (real name Stefan Griebl) published an incredibly stupid text “Lob der Feigheit” (Praise for Cowardice) in “Der Standard.” In it, he suggested that Ukrainians shouldn’t fight, but surrender instead. Yes, your territory would be occupied, he wrote, and Ukraine, perhaps, would disappear as a state for a short period of time, but you would all be alive. Does Putin plan to occupy Ukraine for a “short period of time?” No, his plan is for Ukraine to disappear forever. Austria’s attitude toward sanctions against Russia isn’t clear yet. There are many reasons for this. Economic relations are the first reason. Austrian and Russian banks are interlinked to a great extent. Russian gas is the second reason. Austria depended on Russia for up to 80 percent of its gas. Austrians, of course, were aware of the situation, but they said that Russian gas was cheap, and Russians — reliable partners. They said so even in 2014 when Crimea and eastern Ukraine were occupied. The third reason is that many Austrians see Russia as being closer to them than America. There is a strong anti-American sentiment in Austria. It is interesting that Austria suffered from the Soviet army, not the American army. To put it in primitive metaphors, Russians raped women, while Americans gave them chocolate. “The deep Russian soul” and “great Russian literature” is something people say, but they have never read Dostoyevsky, Lermontov, or Tolstoy. Nevertheless, they are convinced that Russia has a great culture, and America has only nonsense. RELATED: Georgi Gospodinov: ‘We have to be better readers than Putin and his circle’ Chytomo: It is obvious that people in Europe did not quite understand Russia’s true intentions both after the annexation of part of Georgia in 2008 and after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Do you think that Austrians have already realized the Kremlin’s intention to destroy the collective West, Europe and America? Martin Pollack: I don’t think so. Back in 2014, I said it wasn’t just about Ukraine or Crimea, but about the whole of Europe. Many people disagree and state we need to negotiate with Putin. That’s exactly what all Austrian politicians think. Chancellor Karl Negammer went to see Putin at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. What he did was ridiculous. Everyone knows that Austria is not a major political player. It only showed Russia that they are not isolated because European politicians are coming to talk to Putin. The understanding of the real situation is still lacking in Austria. The root of this problem is that Austria cannot comprehend what Ukraine actually is. One of my friends, an aristocrat born in Prague involved in Eastern Europe studies for a long time, asked me two years ago: “Martin, is Ukraine a state? Isn’t Ukrainian language a Russian dialect?” These are Putin’s exact words: that Ukraine never existed. Many Austrians believed this. And this changed with the outbreak of a full-scale invasion. The brutality of Russia, the massacre Russian troops had committed, demonstrates barbarism, not the “mysterious Russian soul” and great culture. Chytomo: I would like to go a bit deeper into the topic of the pro-Russian worldview. In my opinion the prevalence of this view is due to the fact that Ukraine wasn’t present in the information field for many years, and Slavic studies departments mostly taught Russian, not Ukrainian or other Slavic languages. In addition, Russian cultural diplomacy was quite powerful. I remember an exhibition in the Albertina, the largest art gallery in Vienna where Stalin and Nicholas I of Russia stood together. In his recent interview, Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage Museum, argued that the Russian presence abroad is an instrument of cultural dominance and that an exhibition in Paris, for example, means a Russian flag over the Bois de Boulogne. It seems to me that this pro-Russian attitude is deeply ingrained in Austria. What needs to be done to make Austrians accept what is hidden behind cultural diplomacy? Martin Pollack: There are many discussions on this topic in the field of music. For example, the famous musician Anna Netrebko has both Austrian and Russian citizenship. Many people said she only worked in the culture field, not in politics. Nonsense. She is, of course, involved. It isn’t hard to find pictures of her proudly standing with the DPR flag. She said she didn’t know what kind of flag it was. Oh come on… Of course she knew where she was standing and what kind of flag it was. There is also a Greek-Russian conductor, Teodor Currentzis (he played the main role in DAU, a film by Ilya Khrzhanovskiy), who is very popular in Europe. There are discussions about whether he can perform. At first, he was given a chance to perform. Although in 2014 he took Russian citizenship when Putin offered it to him. In Vienna, people love music and are crazy about opera. Austrians literally worship Netrebko. This is a good argument for Russians. We wage a war, but here is our culture. We are not barbarians. Our art is the pinnacle of culture. No one can do it better than us. Chytomo: What can we do to change these pro-Russian optics? Martin Pollack: What you need to do is to spread Ukrainian culture. It is possible. Serhiy Zhadan, for example, is very popular here, but I must admit that a mostly marginalized group of people is interested in Ukrainian literature. Actually, not many people are interested in literature as a whole. It is true that Anna Netrebko does not sing an ode to Putin. She sings Italian opera. But she is involved in Putin’s affairs, just like many other artists. They have earned incredible amounts of money in the West and live here. And what do those who shout about the decaying West do? Their children go to school in Switzerland, Austria, or Britain. They also buy their villas there. We need to work continuously. We have to invite Ukrainian authors, grant them scholarships, and the opportunity to live in the West longer. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, I organized a big event at the Volksstheater in Vienna. I was in the hospital at the time, undergoing chemotherapy. I started calling everyone who could help. Representatives of the theater agreed and supported the idea. Everything was organized during two weeks, and it was a great success. Austrian authors read works by Ukrainian authors. It was an incredible event, almost 600 people came to see and to listen. The publicity was incredible. Doing this is extremely important. This should be done individually, no need to wait for an institution to do it. Unfortunately, there is not much interest in Eastern Europe. This also applies to language. Germans and Austrians go to the Czech Republic and speak German there, expecting to be understood. But this is the Czech Republic, not Germany. This is the colonial experience, the consciousness from the time of Nazism, the idea that Slavs are somehow worse. That the West has a high culture and should bring this culture to the East. Chytomo: In your book “Contaminated Landscapes,” you write about the land and the places that have lost hundreds, thousands of people. As an author who has worked with such a complicated topic, do you see history repeating itself and the rise of the ideology of fascism in the 21st century? Martin Pollack: I really can’t say that everything is the same, that Putin is Hitler, and that everything is repeated exactly, but it is true that many things are repeated. In particular, territorial claims like “Russia is where Russians are.” Germans did the same about the Sudetenland. There are many obvious analogies. For example, Russians committed a massacre, and like all criminals, they try to hide their crime. No corpse — no crime. They try to bury the bodies, to make it look like nothing happened. The Nazis did the same thing. Moreover, they approached the issue like gardeners: they planted trees and flowers on the gravesites. So that there was no trace of it. In Ukraine, there was no time for this now, but the intention is the same. Russians are trying to hide the truth from the world. They are trying to camouflage it. Exactly the same thing happened in Katyn, when Russians said that the executions were carried out by the Nazis. It could have been Nazis, but in this case it was Russians. That’s the way it was. This is the logic that Putin is using now. He is lying. Putin is lying and he knows that his interlocutor knows that he is lying, but he is lying anyway. No one dares to say, “Hey Putin, you are lying.” It’s politeness, diplomacy, and fear. This is where Putin triumphs. It is his internal triumph, because he lies to the face of the whole world. RELATED: Yuri Andrukhovych on irony during war, ‘quarantining’ Russian’ and why he believes in a Ukrainian victory Chytomo: When I see news about mass graves in Bucha, Izyum or Lyman, torture, rape, I often think of your books. It’s hard to accept the fact that history is repeating itself. In the 21st century, a time of democracy and freedom, Russia is committing genocide. As you wrote, in Nazi times there were many inactive observers. And now the world is watching this tragedy and cannot or does not want to stop it. Martin Pollack: I wonder why feminist organizations have not reacted critically to these numerous rapes. Women are incredibly brave. If you look at the protests in Poland, Belarus, or even Russia, there are many women participating in them, taking the initiative. I think the feminists community’s reaction to Russian atrocities was too weak. Unfortunately, rape is a form of war. It is a weapon. Russians use rape as a weapon. To break people morally, to destroy them. This is the experience of World War II. Response of the West is delayed, everyone is too cautious. There are letters from German intellectuals who write that we must return to dialogue with Russia. Even Jürgen Habermas, an incredibly wise and sharp thinker, stated this. Those who say there’s nothing we can achieve using weapons have a poor understanding of the concept of pacifism. Right now, something can only be done with weapons. Conversations will be held later. First of all Russians must be defeated, destroyed and their troops must be withdrawn from the entire territory of Ukraine. There must be no compromises. It’s so funny that here in the West they say that Ukraine will not be much smaller if we give up a small part of it, like Luhansk or Donetsk. There are people who say: well, many Ukrainians speak Russian. Yes, of course, just like there are Swiss who speak French, there are Swiss who speak Italian. No one would say that they are French or Italian. There are countries with linguistic diversity. Thank God there are! Chytomo: You have been working on comprehending the theme of World War II. I often think of Theodor Adorno’s words about what kind of literature is possible after Auschwitz? In your opinion, what kind of literature is possible after Bucha, Izyum, and other occupied cities where people are being killed in real time? Martin Pollack: It is impossible to fully comprehend the war so far, it is too early. But we need to document it. In Europe, it was believed that such evil was no longer possible, that we were living in different times. I am a child of war, born in 1944. I was in a house that was bombed for over 48 hours, we were hiding in the basement. Then they had to dig us out of the rubble. And it was easy to overlook a small child… I often think that my life began in war and will end in war. We are used to living in safety. That there are human rights, and a person goes skiing and hundreds of ski lifts go up and down for you. These are human rights for the younger generation. They think that this is the world, that it consists of this. They go out in the evening until 3 a.m. and they have enough money and a car. This is how they grew up. Now we face a new challenge, because we also have to fight for democracy. Democracy is not given by God, no. It is not a water tap that you open and water pours out. No one asks themselves: where does this water come from? It doesn’t matter where it comes from. Many people think that it is the same with democracy. That it is here, no one is killing us, that we live in a democratic country. Yes, with many shortcomings, but we don’t have to do anything because everything is functioning as it is. We have to make efforts every day for democracy. We have to fight, criticize, and protest.

    "title": "National reports, claims against Father Rupnik dominate 2023 headlines about abuse",
    "text": "Efforts continued throughout 2023 to tackle clerical sex crimes in the Catholic Church, with church or state reports being published in several European countries and the case of Father Marko Rupnik making numerous waves of headlines.\n\"There are very basic principles in crisis management that the church is finally learning to implement,\" said Yago de la Cierva, communications professor who teaches at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome and author of a book on crisis management for the church.\n\"One of them is: investigate what happened and report it to your stakeholders, they have the right to know, so prevention starts on truth,\" the crisis expert told OSV News. \"But even more important is taking care of victims. Their first need is not economic compensation nor vengeance, but information about what happened and why.\"\nIn de la Cierva's native Spain, the bishops' conference pledged amends when a parliament-appointed commission, headed by ombudsman Ángel Gabilondo, reported that one in 10 citizens had suffered abuse as minors, around 1.13% said that the abuse occurred in the religious sphere and, of these, 0.6% said they have been sexually abused by a priest or religious.\nHowever, many of the Gabilondo report's recommendations had already been adopted, the conference added, while media claims of 400,000 church-related victims were \"false and unfounded.\"\n\"We express pain for the damage caused and reiterate our plea for forgiveness -- we also wish to work together towards a comprehensive reparation for victims,\" the Madrid-based conference said in an Oct. 31 statement.\n\"While abuses committed in the church are a cause of pain, the extrapolations made from this report's data do not correspond to the truth or properly represent those priests and religious who loyally dedicate their lives to serving the Kingdom,\" the Spanish bishops said.\nThe expert stressed, however, that \"the Spanish bishops didn't take the initiative in launching an investigation, as the Vatican suggested in February 2019, during the so-called abuse summit. Only when they saw the government doing it on its own did they finally decide to take action. But they arrived on the scene late, and lost the narrative battle,\" de la Cierva said. \"Much better to be proactive,\" he emphasized.\nThis was the approach taken by bishops in neighboring Portugal as they reiterated safeguarding commitments, after an independent commission, headed by attorney Pedro Strecht, presented a 500-page report in February with 512 abuse testimonies.\nHowever, Octávio Carmo, chief editor of the Portuguese church's Ecclesia information agency, criticized the Strecht Commission's reliance on anonymous testimonies and said only 17 of the 104 alleged clergy abusers named in its report were still working as priests.\nPope Francis met abuse victims privately in Portugal Aug. 2 during the church's World Youth Day festival, for which staffers and volunteers received training on abuse prevention.\nDuring an evening liturgy, the pope said the church still needed \"humble and ongoing purification,\" recognizing that anger over abuse had contributed to a \"growing detachment from practice of the faith,\" after the Portuguese report said at least 4,815 minors were sexually abused by clergy -- mostly priests -- over seven decades.\nA study in Switzerland, sponsored by the church, commissioned from Zurich University in 2021, and published in 2023, highlighted \"systemic problems,\" noting that the country's six Catholic dioceses still showed varying degrees of \"professionalization\" in countering abuse.\nA big European church still struggling with transparent investigation of abuse is that of Poland. The country's bishops confirmed March 14 they also would appoint a team to investigate clergy crimes.\n\"The wait for the commission is indeed quite long,\" Marcin Przeciszewski, director of Poland's Catholic Information Agency, or KAI, told OSV News. \"But it is also worth understanding the main person responsible for it -- Archbishop Wojciech Polak of Gniezno, delegate of child protection of the Polish bishops. He is clearly preparing that commission patiently and -- yes -- slowly -- but he does that in order to include different stakeholders, like religious orders, and get the real backing of the bishops' conference,\" he said.\nArchbishop Polak, apologized for his church's past \"naivete,\" after a report in the Rzeczpospolita daily suggested much higher rates of child abuse by Catholic clergy had occurred under communist rule than previously believed.\nThe October Synod in Rome also discussed the issue of abuse and its synthesis report acknowledged that \"concrete gestures of penitence\" were still needed to address \"structural conditions that abetted abuse.\"\nThe report mentioned a problem many bishops faced, and because of it -- failed to take action \"in the difficult situation of having to reconcile the role of father with that of judge.\" It might be appropriate, the report noted, to assign \"the judicial task to another body, to be specified canonically.\"\nChurch experts were busy investigating cases In Latin America in 2023, with the adjunct secretary of the Vatican's Dicastery for Doctrine of the Faith, Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna, paid a summer visit to Peru to investigate Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, a lay society of apostolic life, following a parliamentary commission's report on its activities.\nThe Sodalitium's 1971 founder, Luis Fernando Figari, was sanctioned by the Vatican in 2017 after accusations of systemic abuse against dozens of Sodalitium members. However, nothing had been done \"to hold the abusers responsible,\" theologian Rocio Figueroa, a former member and abuse victim, told OSV News in July.\nIn neighboring Bolivia, 20 former abuse victims brought legal action Oct. 3 against the Jesuits for protecting pedophile clerics in order-run schools, following the posthumous publication of diary confessions by Spanish Jesuit Father Alfonso Pedrajas by the Spanish El Pais daily in the spring. The publication sparked accusations against other priests in Bolivia and an investigation pledge by the country's bishops, as well as a letter to the pope by Bolivian president Luis Arce, requesting access to Vatican files.\nIn the United States, a number of Catholic dioceses filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code during the year: the dioceses of Albany and Ogdensburg, New York, and Oakland and Santa Rosa, California, and the archdioceses of San Francisco and Baltimore. In December, the Diocese of Sacramento, California, announced it will file for bankruptcy by March.\nIn February, the Diocese of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, reached an $18 million settlement and pledged further actions for abuse survivors. It came three years after the diocese declared bankruptcy. In July, the Diocese of Syracuse, New York, reached a multimillion dollar settlement in its June 2020 bankruptcy case, in an effort to redress both current and potential abuse claims. On Nov. 27, the Diocese of Rockville Centre, New York, proposed a $200 million settlement of 600 child sex abuse claims. Facing over 200 lawsuits alleging sex abuse filed since New York state lifted the statute of limitations on such cases, the diocese filed for Chapter 11 in Oct. 1, 2020.\nWhat sparked probably the biggest outrage, however, in the Catholic world in 2023 regarding abuse, were claims against Slovene mosaic artist Father Marko Rupnik.\nFather Rupnik was expelled from the Jesuit order June 9 because of his \"stubborn refusal to observe the vow of obedience.\" The artist had been accused by several women of sexual, spiritual and psychological abuses that occurred over a 30-year period, according to media reports. He remained a priest after his dismissal from the Jesuits, and was received into the Diocese of Koper, Slovenia, at the end of August in response to his request.\n\"How distressing this must be for the religious sisters who were his victims,\" Antonia Sobocki, director of the British-based LOUDFence organization, told OSV News. \"People are so tired of seeing the church and its moral authority sacrificed on the altar of the careers of such clerics.\"\nOn Oct. 27, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis was lifting the statute of limitations in order to investigate numerous accusations of sexual abuse by the priest.\n\"I am grateful to Pope Francis for reopening the case and letting a canonical judge examine the facts,\" de la Cierva said. \"But punishing the guilty (if that's the case) is only a part of restoring justice. Even more important is to take care of the victims from the past and avoid new victims. And to do so, an investigation is better than a trial. Pope Francis himself mentioned that cases of sexual abuse of minors and vulnerable adults need transparency, and canonical trials are the opposite of transparent,\" the crisis expert said.\nIn another development in the Rupnik situation, the Vatican announced Dec. 15 it had ordered that the Community of Loyola, a religious community of women founded in Slovenia with the assistance of the priest, be dissolved.\nAn abuse survivor told OSV News a \"much stronger focus\" was needed on victims. \"It's important that speech is now becoming genuinely free as more people feel called to speak out,\" said Daniel Pittet, a university librarian and author of \"Father, I forgive you.\"\n\"Beyond accepting that lies were told and mistakes made, it's essential to recognize how much people were hurt by the church, rather than concentrating solely on preventive and punitive measures,\" Pittet underlined.\nDe la Cierva added that \"some people have said the Rupnik case is for Pope Francis what the case of Cardinal McCarrick was for John Paul. I am not sure about that, but at least they have one thing in common: the need for an external investigation. It's not a case of vengeance, but needing to know in order to learn for the future.\"",

    "text": "Caracas -. Solo juntas, las naciones del Sur Global, podremos defender el derecho de los pueblos y las naciones a vivir en paz, afirmó hoy el ministro para Relaciones Exteriores de Venezuela, Yván Gil. En su cuenta X, antes Twitter, el alto diplomático bolivariano, que participa en la XIX Cumbre del Movimiento de Países No Alineados (Mnoal), con sede en Kampala, Uganda, indicó que transmitió en la reunión “el mensaje fraterno, combativo y solidario” del presidente Nicolás Maduro. Gil manifestó en la red social que el Mnoal está llamado a “asumir su papel central” en la lucha contra quienes propician la guerra eterna y promueven planes para frenar, entre otros, la consolidación de un nuevo mundo multipolar emergente. Durante su intervención la víspera en el foro de alto nivel, el canciller sudamericano expresó la necesidad de avanzar en la convocatoria de una Conferencia Internacional de Paz sobre Palestina, la cual, opinó, debe estar auspiciada por la Organización de las Naciones Unidas. El jefe de la diplomacia venezolana puntualizó que ese encuentro mundial debe abordar las causas raigales del conflicto israelí-palestino y fomentar la plena realización de ese pueblo árabe en sus derechos inalienables como establecer un Estado libre e independiente. Además, dijo, facilitar su ingreso pleno derecho como miembro de las Naciones Unidas, que “ha sido demorado ya por suficiente tiempo”. Exhortó a alzar nuestras voces y a avanzar con “urgencia, determinación y contundencia” en la exigencia de el cese al “fuego inmediato, duradero, sostenible y respetado” en la Franja de Gaza, donde más de 24 mil palestinos, en su mayoría mujeres y niños, murieron por la agresión sionista. Gil denunció la total impunidad con que actúa la potencia ocupante en ese enclave, que a su juicio constituye un verdadero genocidio contra ese heroico pueblo, que más del uno por ciento perdió la vida en esta última escalada del conflicto. Llegó la hora de que el Movimiento de Países No Alineados asuma con “mayor determinación y sentido de urgencia”, el rol protagónico que le corresponde en los esfuerzos destinados de avanzar por la causa de Palestina, que sigue siendo, dijo, principio central del Mnoal contra la opresión y la ocupación, remarcó. En su discurso, el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores bolivariano abordó también el tema de las medidas coercitivas unilaterales y señaló que estas son manifestaciones “modernas de neocolonialismo”, al violar en masa los derechos humanos de los pueblos. Apuntó que esas acciones de presión son el “principal obstáculo” para la consecución de los planes nacionales de desarrollo de los países y pueblos.",
