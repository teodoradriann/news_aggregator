    "text": "A band of storms that blew through Northeast Florida on Friday morning packed a punch with wind gusts reaching up to 70-plus mph. The winds knocked down trees, damaged houses and affected traffic across Jacksonville and beyond. MORE: Tractor-trailer toppled on Dames Point Bridge, power knocked out at Duval schools as strong storms move through area On the Northside, a home security camera captured the moment winds uprooted a tree and sent it falling across a road. Trees fell onto vehicles in the Avondale and Biltmore areas. And trees fell onto homes on the Westside and in Columbia County. In Oceanway, a resident sent a photo of a tree that fell through their kitchen door near the intersection of Yellow Bluff Road and New Berlin Road. Another video shared with News4JAX showed shingles flying off apartment building roofs into a parking lot at the Shore House Apartments in the Holiday Hill area. In the Lackawanna area, there were power lines down and an uprooted tree fell onto a house. Police and firefighters responded to help people out of the damaged home. SEND US YOUR PICS: Use SnapJAX and be an Insider Once the morning storms were gone residents all over the city picked up the debris. One was Ronald Smart Sr.. “I’m used to seeing stuff like that happen,” he said. The winds mangled his canopy. On the Northwest side of the city, Kirk Bailey had a tree crash into his home while his fiancée was inside. “The wind, the whistling and then boom. And it split the whole thing, you can see the outside from the inside,” she said. This maple tree isn’t the first tree to topple over in front of their home. Now they want to get other trees cut down to prevent this from happening again with a future storm. Off Dunn Avenue, Specialty Cartz and Partz had part of its metal roof ripped off by winds, but everyone was OK. Here are some of the strongest reported winds in the area on Friday morning: - 73 mph at the top of EverBank Stadium - 66 mph at Mayport - 65 mph at Huguenot Park - 62 mph at Craig Airport - 59 mph at NAS Jax Jennifer Calendar was driving to work when the storm moved through Jacksonville. “Everything was flying everywhere. My car was moving with the wind,” Calendar said. The National Weather Service said it had no sustained rotation tracks as the squall line came through, but added that it’s possible there might’ve been some short-lived spin-ups, also called gustnadoes. The highest wind gusts were measured at 73 mph, but up on the Dames Point Bridge, it would been close to 80 mph. MORE: Storms slam parts of Florida, Mississippi and elsewhere as cleanup from earlier tornadoes continues When the storms moved outcrews began to cut down trees and clean up. And as the community cleaned up from the fast-moving storm, more patience will be needed for the thousands of customers waiting for their electricity to be restored from downed power lines. Those power outages began Friday morning from as far as Tallahassee to Jacksonville. The one good thing, temperatures will be much cooler due to the cold front so the heat will be easier to deal with while customers wait for the power to come back on.",

    "title": "Why The Astrology World Can’t Stop Talking About The Jupiter Uranus Conjunction",
    "text": "You would think the year’s biggest moment in astrology would be an eclipse or a series of ruthless retrogrades . But in 2024, the biggest astrological happening is the simple conjunction of two planets: Jupiter and Uranus.\nIn astrology, a conjunction is when two planets align in the same part of the sky, under the same zodiac sign . It’s a frequent occurrence among other astral combos, but these two planets have the ability to see big disruptions, changes or manoeuvres on a macro and micro scale.\nThe conjunction of Uranus and Jupiter is set to occur on April 21, 2024 (or April 20, if you’re in the northern hemisphere), following an already significant month of eclipse seasons and mercury retrograde .\nUranus is the planet of rebellion and revolution, while Jupiter is about belief and big picture. Together, they could be pretty wild. According to astrologer Emma Vidgen, known online as @emma_vee , the Jupiter Uranus conjunction is “probably the big moment of the year that everyone’s going to be talking about from an astrology perspective.”\nSo, let’s dive in, shall we?\nWhat Is A Conjunction In Astrology? First thing’s first: what is a conjunction?\nWhen two planets are “conjunct” it means they are in (or around) the same place, in the same sign. If you think of the sky like a large circle divided into 12 sections or ‘houses’, with each house ruled by a different star sign. Then imagine Jupiter and Uranus are lining up at the same degree in the Taurus sector as they both track their usual orbit.\nIn astrology, each planet represents its own themes and features, and the relative closeness of these planets when conjunct, sort of represents a collision or melding of these themes.\nConjunctions happen all the time between many combinations of planets. However, some specific combinations may be more rare than others. The last conjunction between Jupiter and Uranus, for instance, was in 2011, and the next one will be in 2037.\nWhat could Jupiter conjunct Uranus mean for you? Image: Getty What Does The Jupiter Uranus Conjunction Mean? As with all planetary happenings, they mean different things to different people. The Jupiter Uranus conjunction will, according to Emma, be a big moment for society at large.\nAs Jupiter moves its period of time in the sign of Taurus, it will meet Uranus towards its finale in the sign.\nUranus is the planet of rebellion, uprisings, defiance and revolution. Jupiter, being the planet of belief and big picture, this collision is going to be huge, Emma says.\n“Jupiter/Uranus conjunctions are historically a time of big revolutions,” Emma explains. “So, there’s the possibility of this rising-up of people based on belief. It will be a very significant moment from a more macro perspective.”\nIn astrology, a map of the sky might look something like this. The houses are numbered 1-12, and the sign of each house will be different depending on your birth chart. Image: Getty What does the Jupiter Uranus conjunction mean for you? While you will certainly witness or feel the effects of these macro-level changes, on a personal level this planetary conjunction is an invitation to shake off any self-imposed restrictions.\nIf you know where Taurus is in your chart, consider how the planet of defiance might lead to bigger things for you in that area. For instance, if you have Taurus in your 5th house of romance, play and creativity, the Jupiter Uranus conjunction might be a good time to take a chance on a new idea or lover.\n“Look for those spontaneous opportunities to say yes to things you might not otherwise,” Emma encourages. “Accept the invitation you normally wouldn’t, go on the date with that person who is a bit outside your remit of what you would normally consider.”\n“It’s really about breaking free of these constraints that we tie ourselves up in. It’s really exciting.”\nRead about all the major moments in 2024 astrology, here.",

    "title": "Politico Reporter Unloaded a 'Dangerous' Commentary About Christianity on MSNBC",
    "text": "This segment was low-hanging fruit, but it’s always a good reminder to know what your enemy is thinking and their end game, often televised on MSNBC and CNN. MSNBC is by far the worst of the two, and ex-NBC News reporter Heidi Przybyla, now with Politico, demonstrated that Thursday night with her screed against Christianity. Of course, it was framed under the guise of Christian nationalism. Still, the commentary was very much grounded in mainstream concepts about where rights come from, as Thomas Jefferson is the person who wrote about what Przybyla found unsettling (via [Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/opinion/msnbc-guest-panics-over-christians-believing-rights-come-from-god-instead-of-earthly-authority/)): Here— Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] [February 23, 2024] After being asked how members of Congress were reacting to Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-LA) leadership, which was characterized as an “infusion of Christian nationalism into the body politic of the House,” Przybyla proceeded to butcher her interpretation of the distinction between Christians and Christian nationalists. After warning that Christian nationalists “have a lot of power in Trump’s circle,” she insisted that “the one thing that unites all of them, because there’s many different groups orbiting Trump, but the thing that unites them as Christian nationalists — not Christians, by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different — is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority. They don’t come from Congress, they don’t come to the Supreme Court, they come from God.” Recommended Wild clip. This is one of their journos, not a pundit.— Guy Benson (@guypbenson) [https://t.co/8lLSfOiZl3] [February 23, 2024] During the pandemic, Przybyla [couldn’t accurately](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2020/04/16/nbc-reporter-again-peddles-shoddy-article-about-hydroxychloroquine-n2567092) comment on a story about an Arizona couple who allegedly took hydroxychloroquine, which led to deadly results. The outlet tried to blame Trump, but the pair ingested chloroquine phosphate, fish tank cleaner, which isn’t the same thing. Stop publishing garbage like this.— AG (@AGHamilton29) 1) Family doesn’t actually know cause of death. 2) Every drug has risks and side effects. Implication here is that this drug is particularly dangerous and the doctor was irresponsible in prescribing it, which is a smear without evidence. [https://t.co/CPxfu6oVZK] [April 16, 2020] Catholic Bishop Robert Barron saw the clip and took to social media to comment on it, calling the segment the ‘one of the most disturbing and frankly dangerous things I’ve ever seen in a political conversation.’ Bishop Barron pointed out that Jefferson is the one who penned the concept of our inalienable rights coming from God while adding the obvious: rights that come from the government can be taken away. Hence, why this flawed government theory is fertile ground for totalitarianism. He noted that this isn’t a religious nationalism but “one of the sanest principles of our democratic governance.” Friends, I wanted to share some reflections with you concerning a recent clip I saw from— Bishop Robert Barron (@BishopBarron) [@MSNBC], which was one of the most disturbing and frankly dangerous things I’ve ever seen in a political conversation. [@HeidiReports] [@politico] [pic.twitter.com/3KO9LY4eXh] [February 23, 2024] Our rights come from God; the government exists to secure them, not produce them. Ms. Przybyla doesn’t seem to get it yet, either. Thank you.— Heidi Przybyla 🌺 (@HeidiReports) While there are different wings of Christian Nationalism, they are bound by their belief that our rights come from God. If you are Hindu, Jewish etc, this might help you understand the next part of my point, which is they are using this for a man-made policy agenda. [https://t.co/7FoVJh1UTx] [February 23, 2024]",
