    "text": "“Every single person on the street today is a child of God,” Audrée-Anne Bauer told The Catholic Register as she and others in the youth group at Mission St. Irenaeus parish distributed food bags contained fresh fruit, cheese and muffins along with the water and coffee. “A priest once told me: ‘If you ever see someone in distress, sad or in poverty, you can almost picture the image of Jesus in the suffering and poverty. You can think, would I do it for Jesus? If the answer is yes, then you should do it for His children,’” she added. Mission Saint Irenaeus parish straddles the boundary between Montreal’s Little Burgundy and St. Henri neighbourhoods. It’s a block north of the trendy Atwater Market and nearby upscale condos that overlook the Lachine canal. It’s also across the street from busy Lionel Groulx Metro, a lower town gathering spot for the impoverished, the addicted, and those with nowhere else to go. The church offers the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite or Tridentine Mass. Its youth group comprises young Catholic adults 18-35 years old who come from all parts of city. The group has always had a heart for the poor, sometimes reaching out to them after Sunday Mass. In mid-afternoon on Boxing Day, 12 volunteers walked up the long hill that crests at Ste. Catherine Street. There, the bustling Alexis Nihon shopping centre stands kitty corner to Cabot Square Park, a favoured resting place of Montreal’s downtown downtrodden. The volunteers carried with them the food and refreshment they’d spent time in the church basement putting into bags for distribution. Youth group member Eloucia Vernet told the Register she was there offer a “snack done with love” to those who needed love as much as sustenance. “During Christmas many people find themselves with friends, family and their stomachs are full. Meanwhile, others are completely abandoned,” Vernet said. “ My goal today was to make a homemade snack for them that was done with love, to let them know that we are thinking of them and that they are not alone. Even if we can’t help them every day, today this is a small charity gesture we can extend.” Francesco B., sipping on a hot coffee extended to him, agreed to talk about his experience but didn’t want his last name used. He had been out on the street since 2016, and now lives in a Metro station because the shelter where he was staying was so violent. He worked part-time at a car wash but health problems forced him to quit. “There is no safe place anywhere in reality. The moment someone has bad intentions towards others and has committed a crime in the past, he will repeat it because it’s his only way of making money. It’s severe. It’s become that way globally,” Francesco said. He expressed gratitude for the youth outreach: “It means a lot. I know it’s sincere. I feel it. You know, in life the wind can change at any moment.” Mike, 62, originally from Mauritania, has been on the streets since 2013. He sleeps in a shelter, but says he often prefers to spend the night at a local McDonald's that is open until 5 a.m. He confirmed there is a lot of violence in the shelters. Most homeless met by the youth group admitted to being in their circumstances due to divorce or mental health issues. The outreach was considered successful and gave the youth future ideas about the needs of the homeless. “We managed to get food to people out there that were in need,” said Matthew Poirier, a young Catholic adult from B.C. who was visiting family at Saint Irenaeus. “You could see it by the way they talked and acted. Some of them had a big smile. We were just trying to make them feel better, and a bit more joyful in the holy season that is Christmas.” The only thing I would add for next time is maybe on the hygiene side, socks, etc. But all in all, it was a successful and good outcome.” Poirier suggested perhaps next year clean socks and other items on the “hygiene side” could be distributed along with food and refreshment. In October 2022, Quebec's public health institute [reported](https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/inc/documents/ministere/salle-de-presse/Fiche_technique_Resultats_denombrement_2022_23-09-01_VF.pdf) a rising rate of homelessness throughout Quebec. Montreal was the hardest hit city with 4 690 homeless. Statistics Canada says there are 25, 000 to 35, 000 people homeless in Canada. But for Audrée-Anne Bauer, the hard cold numbers weren’t the selling point for being on Montreal’s streets among the disadvantaged the day after the celebration of Christ’s birth. “It was for the glory of God. That would be our motivation,” she said.",

    "text": "Heavy rains continued to batter parts of Kerala on Friday, prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue an ‘orange alert’ for three southern districts. This alert applies to Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta, indicating the possibility of very heavy rainfall ranging from 6 cm to 20 cm in these areas.\nIn addition, a ‘yellow alert’ was issued for six other districts across the state, signifying heavy rainfall between 6 cm and 11 cm. These warnings highlight the ongoing intensity of the monsoon season in Kerala, which has led to widespread weather disruptions.\nThe Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has also stepped up its advisory efforts, cautioning the public about the risk of strong winds accompanying the rainfall. The authority has shared safety guidelines, urging residents to remain vigilant, especially in flood-prone and landslide-prone regions.\nThis follows Thursday’s alerts when the IMD issued a ‘red alert’—the highest level of warning—for three districts and an ‘orange alert’ for five others. The heavy downpours have raised concerns about potential disruptions to daily life, waterlogging, and damage in vulnerable areas, with authorities closely monitoring the situation.\nWith inputs from PTI",

(Image:DC) Hyderabad: Thousands of Muslims participated in a vibrant procession, on foot, on bikes and on vehicles, to celebrate Milad-un-Nabi, following the Zohar namaz at Macca Masjid on Thursday. Originally set for Tuesday, the event was postponed by two days due to Ganesh idol immersion and Liberation Day.\nBefore the procession commenced, religious scholars delivered speeches emphasising the Prophet’s messages of peace, harmony, and brotherhood. The Markazi Milad Juloos Committee has been organising this procession for the past two decades. Shujauddin Ifteqari, a committee member, remarked, “This event helps many young people learn about the Prophet and his timeless teachings.”\nHazrat Syed Kamil Pasha, Aashiq Khan Rasool, Syed Junaid Pasha Quadri, Dr Hafez Mohammed, Mahmood Hussain, and Syeed Quadari were among those who attended the procession.\nThe procession travelled through various locations, including Falaknuma, Volta Hotel, Yahiya Pasha Dargah, Macca Masjid, Haj House, Patherghatti, Alijah Kotla, Lal Darwaza crossroads, Charminar, Gulzar Houz, Madina, Nayapul bridge, Salar Jung Museum, Salajung Rotary, Purani Haveli, Etebar Chowk, and Bibi Bazaar.\nIn Secunderabad, mosques were beautifully illuminated for Milad-un-Nabi, and hundreds of youth participated in a procession starting from Chilkalguda crossroads, passing through Sitaphalmandi, Vidyanagar, and Amberpet. Local Milad celebration committee members warmly welcomed participants, offering fruit juice and water.\nAlso, blood donation camps, which began three days earlier in conjunction with Milad, continued on Thursday. At a drive held at Masjid Dargah Hazrath Syed Budde Shah Wali in West Marredpally, many youths came forward to donate blood. Committee members expressed gratitude for the community’s support, stating, “Saving lives is at the heart of the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.”\nA large gathering was also held at Jamia Masjid Himayat Ali Khan on the Osmania University campus, attended by numerous faithful.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "Actualité santé | News 24\nUn nouveau vaccin cible avec précision les tumeurs cérébrales mortelles\nRésumé: Un nouveau vaccin peut mobiliser le système immunitaire pour cibler et attaquer avec précision les tumeurs cérébrales cancéreuses, en particulier les gliomes, l’un des types de tumeurs cérébrales les plus mortelles. Ce travail révolutionnaire démontre que le système immunitaire de l’organisme peut être dirigé vers des protéines cibles présentant des mutations cancéreuses dans les tumeurs, marquant ainsi une avancée significative en immunothérapie.\nLes essais cliniques ont confirmé que cette approche, axée sur la mutation IDH1 présente dans de nombreux gliomes, est à la fois sûre et efficace. Cette réalisation a été récompensée par le prix « Percée de l’année 2024 », reconnaissant son potentiel d’impact à grande échelle dans le traitement du cancer.\nFaits clés :\n- Les chercheurs ont conçu des vaccins qui dirigent le système immunitaire pour cibler la mutation IDH1, cruciale dans de nombreux gliomes.\n- Des essais ont montré que ces vaccins sont sûrs et capables de générer des réponses immunitaires ciblées.\n- Cette immunothérapie de précision pourrait conduire à des applications plus larges dans divers cancers.\nSource: DKFZ\nLes recherches de Michael Platten ont un objectif majeur : il veut faire progresser la guérison de l’une des formes les plus mortelles de tumeurs cérébrales, connue sous le nom de gliomes.\nSes travaux ont montré que le système immunitaire des patients peut être mobilisé grâce à de nouveaux vaccins contre cette forme de cancer. Les défenses de l’organisme sont alors capables de prendre des mesures très précises contre les protéines modifiées qui conduisent la croissance tumorale.\nMichael Platten sera récompensé pour ses découvertes révolutionnaires par le prix « Percée de l’année 2024 » décerné par la Falling Wall Foundation à Berlin le 9 novembre 2024.\nPlatten est chef de l’unité de coopération clinique neuroimmunologie et immunologie des tumeurs cérébrales du centre allemand de recherche sur le cancer (DKFZ) et directeur du département de neurologie du centre médical universitaire de Mannheim (UMM). Depuis octobre, Platten est également président de l’Association européenne de neuro-oncologie (EANO).\nSon implication dans la pratique clinique est un élément essentiel du succès scientifique de Platten : « Mon inspiration vient principalement des patients qui luttent chaque jour contre cette maladie dévastatrice », déclare Platten.\nIl estime qu’il est d’une importance capitale que les scientifiques développent des solutions qui apportent des améliorations réelles et tangibles à la vie des gens, poursuit le chercheur en cancérologie.\nBriser le mur des vaccins contre les tumeurs cérébrales\nDes essais cliniques ont déjà confirmé que son idée d’activer le système immunitaire à l’aide de vaccins contre les cellules tumorales fonctionne. Lors de ces essais, les vaccins se sont révélés sûrs et efficaces.\nLa preuve que son vaccin peut déclencher une réponse immunitaire ciblée dans la tumeur cérébrale d’un patient a été pour lui un moment décisif, explique Platten.\nThérapie tumorale de précision\nCe qui rend les découvertes de Platten si spéciales, c’est la précision avec laquelle le système immunitaire peut attaquer les cellules cancéreuses après activation par les nouveaux vaccins : il reconnaît d’infimes différences entre les protéines normales et celles présentant des mutations cancéreuses dans leur modèle.\nSon équipe a découvert que la mutation dite IDH1 joue notamment un rôle clé dans de nombreux gliomes. Cette mutation se produit dans près de 70 pour cent des gliomes de bas grade ou à croissance lente.\nL’immunothérapie développée par Platten cible précisément cette mutation IDH1 afin de générer une réponse immunitaire large et efficace englobant toutes les cellules tumorales, même si elles diffèrent génétiquement les unes des autres. Les cellules cancéreuses peuvent ainsi être éliminées de manière très spécifique.\nApplication non seulement contre les tumeurs cérébrales\nÀ l’aide d’outils avancés de bioinformatique et de biologie moléculaire, son équipe a développé des immunothérapies cellulaires spécifiques qui peuvent potentiellement être utilisées non seulement contre les tumeurs cérébrales mais également contre d’autres types de cancer.\nL’idée derrière cela est que les mutations identifiées sont présentes dans toutes les cellules tumorales d’un patient, ce qui est crucial pour que les vaccins soient efficaces.\nPlatten souhaite également que ses recherches inspirent la prochaine génération de scientifiques. Son conseil aux jeunes chercheurs est le suivant : « Soyez courageux, posez des questions, travaillez en équipe et partagez vos connaissances. Et si nécessaire, n’ayez pas peur de vous lancer dans des domaines de recherche complètement nouveaux.»\nSommet scientifique Falling Walls 2024\nLe titre « Percée scientifique de l’année de Falling Walls » est décerné chaque année. Il récompense les avancées scientifiques les plus significatives dans diverses catégories de l’appel mondial Falling Walls. Les lauréats présentent leurs travaux révolutionnaires à un public mondial lors du Falling Walls Science Summit à Berlin le 9 novembre 2024.\nMichael Platten est l’un des dix lauréats dans la catégorie Sciences de la vie et finalement le lauréat de la Percée de l’année 2024 dans les Sciences de la vie.\nÀ propos de cette actualité sur la recherche sur le cancer du cerveau\nAuteur: Sibylle Kohlstädt\nSource: DKFZ\nContact: Sibylle Kohlstädt – DKFZ\nImage: L’image est créditée à Neuroscience News\nRecherche originale : La conférence pourra être suivie en ligne le 9 novembre de 17h15 à 17h30 : https://falling-walls.com/foundation/people/michael-platten",
