    "text": "Jéssica Bate-Estaca fará um duelo verde e amarelo no próximo sábado (7), contra Natália Silva (Foto: Reprodução) Pensando nisso, Bate-Estaca concedeu uma entrevista ao podcast \"Trocação Franca\" e declarou que, caso vença seu duelo, vai falar com Dana White e pedir uma disputa de cinturão, independente de qual for a categoria. A paranaense garantiu que aceita lutar pelo cinturões peso-mosca, peso-palha e até mesmo o cinturão \"BMF\" (lutador mais casca-grossa). O título \"BMF\" para mulheres ainda não existe, mas Jéssica já garantiu uma adversária para uma eventual disputa do simbólico cinturão: a ex-campeã e membro do Hall da Fama da organização, Joanna Jedrzejczyk, que deixou o MMA em 2022 e atualmente tem 37 anos. \"Vou falar para o Dana White que não importa, pode ser no peso-palha, peso-mosca, pode ser o cinturão BMF, o que tiver disponível para mim eu quero. Eu quero uma disputa de cinturão. Eu já andei conservando com a Joanna Jedrzejczyk e ela disse que voltaria (da aposentaria) se fosse uma luta pelo cinturão BMF. Acho que seria uma boa luta. Se não, a Angela Hill, que não nega fogo para nada, ela está sempre lutando em tudo, ou a Valentina Shevchenko\", declarou Bate-Estaca, que seguiu: \"Qualquer uma dessas meninas seria muito bom, mas com a Joanna seria um ícone diferente. Eu iria fazer uma estratégia totalmente diferente. Ela já disse que não lutaria no peso-palha, mas sim no mosca, e para mim seria até melhor, porque é uma categoria onde eu me sinto muito bem e não iria ficar prejudicada com corte de peso. Acho que a gente faria um show, uma luta muito legal e eu ia descontar (a derrota sofrida para Joanna, em 2017)\", finalizou a brasileira. Aos 32 anos de idade, Jéssica Bate-Estaca é ex-campeã peso-palha e atual quarta colocada do ranking da divisão até 52kg. A lutadora chegou à segunda vitória seguida na carreira ao derrotar Marina Rodriguez no UFC 300, em abril. Antes disso, a brasileira havia derrotado Mackenzie Dern no UFC 295, em novembro do ano passado, se recuperando de três reveses seguidos. Como profissional, a paranaense tem agora 38 lutas, com 26 triunfos e 12 resultados negativos.",

    "title": "Undersea Cables Latest Target of China's Hybrid Warfare Strategy",
    "text": "In December, European officials launched an investigation into the sabotage of undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea , allegedly severed by a Chinese-flagged vessel. Earlier this month, a similar incident near Taiwan centered around a Chinese vessel suspected of severing an undersea fiber-optic cable. The vessel in question was operating under multiple flags and identities in violation of international norms, likely in an effort to conceal its identity and obscure any links to Beijing. These incidents exemplify China’s use of “gray zone,” or hybrid warfare tactics—irregular, non-combat operations aimed at applying military pressure to adversaries, though pressure that falls short of eliciting a strong military response that could lead to open conflict.\nRecent incidents involving undersea cables align with China’s broader hybrid warfare strategy, a calculated blend of military and non-military tactics designed to achieve geopolitical goals while avoiding direct confrontation. The targeting critical infrastructure such as undersea cables highlights China’s ability to disrupt communication networks, undermining Taiwan’s economic stability and national security. Apart from the physical damage, these acts send a clear psychological message, generating uncertainty and emphasizing the vulnerabilities of Taiwan and its allies.\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has an established record of employing hybrid warfare as a strategic tool to assert dominance and destabilize opposition. In the South China Sea, Beijing’s approach integrates political, economic, military, and societal tactics to advance territorial claims and consolidate control over disputed areas while avoiding direct conflict. Key elements of the strategy include leveraging nonmilitary forces, such as the coast guard and maritime militias , employing intimidation tactics like ramming, shadowing, near-collisions, and using military-grade lasers.",

    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. — Two sisters have filed multi-million dollar lawsuits against a Virginia Baptist church, claiming the church leaders did not stop sexual abuse by a youth group assistant. The women claim the abuse took place between 2006 and 2009, beginning when the women were 6 and 10 years old. Gerald R. Thomas, a now-convicted sex offender, is accused of grooming and sexually assaulting the girls on an almost weekly basis during church youth programs. The youth group operated at Bethany Place Baptist Church in North Chesterfield. It was acquired by Coastal Church, LLC in 2023 and was rebranded as Coastal Church – Bethany Campus. The church has multiple locations in Hampton Roads, including Chesapeake, Gloucester, Hampton, Williamsburg and Yorktown. Court documents list the church as being based in Yorktown. The sisters, who were not identified in court documents, said they were assaulted for years on church property and \"often in full view of other staff and volunteers,\" according to a statement from the sisters' attorneys. \"Despite multiple red flags and direct observations by Bethany Place leadership, no meaningful action was taken to protect the girls or remove Thomas from access to children,\" the statement said. The sisters claim that church leaders and volunteers witnessed Thomas engage in inappropriate behavior, including isolating the girls and inappropriately touching them in public settings. The lawsuits claim no internal reports were filed, and no steps were taken to remove Thomas. Thomas was arrested and charged in 2010 after one of the sisters reported the abuse to her school counselor, which prompted a mandatory investigation. He pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual battery in 2010 in cases involving both sisters, according to the sisters' legal counsel. Thomas was found guilty in 2020 of abusing a third underage victim. Bethany Place is accused of failing to implement protective policies, such as proper adult-to-child ratios, background checks, and prevention of one-on-one interactions between adults and children. The lawsuit claims the incidents came after warnings and national guidelines issued by the Southern Baptist Convention and the Centers for Disease Control. The lawsuits are demanding accountability on five claims: assault and battery, gross negligence and reckless disregard, breach of duty (including from a custodial relationship), negligent retention and vicarious liability. Each sister is seeking $50 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages, citing years of emotional trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder. They also claim a loss of quality of life and earning capacity.",

    "text": "A Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) enviou nesta quinta-feira (27) ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) parecer para manter a prisão dos irmãos Domingos e Chiquinho Brazão e do ex-chefe da Polícia Civil do Rio de Janeiro Rivaldo Barbosa. Eles estão presos desde março deste ano pelo suposto envolvimento no assassinato da vereadora Marielle Franco e do motorista Anderson Gomes, em 2018.\nNo parecer, o vice-procurador Hidenburgo Chateaubriand afirma que os três acusados devem continuar presos. A custódia, segundo a PGR, é necessária para garantia da ordem pública e o andamento das investigações. O pedido de soltura foi feito ao Supremo pela defesa dos acusados.\nNotícias relacionadas: Moraes abre novo inquérito para apurar assassinato de Marielle . STF torna irmãos Brazão réus pelo assassinato de Marielle .\n“Esse quadro, em virtude do qual se justificou a decretação das prisões que os denunciados pretendem agora ver revogadas, não sofreu nenhuma alteração. Os elementos fáticos permanecem rigorosamente os mesmos, não havendo, portanto, motivo para que se desfaçam as decisões que foram, com base neles, proferidas”, argumentou o procurador.\nO pedido para soltar os três acusados foi feito ao ministro Alexandre de Moraes, que é relator do caso. Segundo as defesas, não há perigo de fuga e medidas menos gravosas podem ser determinadas pelo ministro.\nNa terça-feira (18), o Supremo transformou em réus o conselheiro do Tribunal de Contas do Rio de Janeiro (TCE-RJ), Domingos Brazão, o irmão dele, Chiquinho Brazão, deputado federal (sem partido-RJ), o ex-chefe da Polícia Civil do Rio de Janeiro Rivaldo Barbosa e o major da Policia Militar Ronald Paulo de Alves Pereira. Todos respondem pelos crimes de homicídio e organização criminosa.",
