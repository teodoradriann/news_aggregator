    "text": "Connecticut jumps ahead of Massachusetts, as 4 of 6 New England states boost their minimum wages Minimum wages go up in four of the six New England states on January 1. For years, Massachusetts has led the minimum wage race in New England. That ends in 2024, when Connecticut's rate — now tied to inflation — goes from $15 an hour to $15.69. At a [September press conference](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2023/09-2023/Governor-Lamont-Announces-Minimum-Wage-Will-Increase-in-January), Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, estimated the increase will mean a direct raise for 10% of Connecticut workers. And it'll put upward pressure on wages for others, Gov. Ned Lamont said, as many businesses have to go well over the minimum to attract employees. \"You're going to have to pay a little more to make it worth it,\" Lamont said. The minimum wage in Massachusetts is holding steady at $15 an hour, with no scheduled increases on the books. Rates in Maine ($14.15), Rhode Island ($14) and Vermont ($13.67) all increase on Jan. 1. New Hampshire's rate has long been stuck at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, last raised in 2009. While proposals to increase Massachusetts' minimum wage have not advanced in the past year, a coalition of groups is pushing for a ballot question to get rid of the state's lower minimum wage for tipped workers. Employers are supposed to make up the difference between the $6.75 rate and the state's $15 minimum wage, but [studies](https://files.epi.org/2014/EPI-CWED-BP379.pdf) have found confusion and logistical hurdles to this happening. Another proposal would boost the state's lower rate for some farm workers. At a Massachusetts [legislative hearing](https://malegislature.gov/Events/Hearings/Detail/4762) this fall, advocates pointed out what many in the state don't know about minimum wage rules. \"Fifteen dollars an hour for virtually everybody except farm workers, who get $8 an hour,\" said Bill Newman, a lawyer with the Massachusetts ACLU. \"That's the law.\" There are another set of farm workers, those in the United State with federal visas, who are entitled to a federal prevailing wage topping $16 an hour, attorney and Western New England University law professor Claudia Quintero told lawmakers. But those protections do not apply to farm workers who are year-round residents of Massachusetts, she said. \"Many of the workers are seasonal,\" Quintero said. \"And many struggle with basic necessities during the winter months.\" Quintero, who leads the Fairness for Farmworkers Coalition, noted these workers also have no overtime protections. Both issues are addressed in [pending legislation](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S1837). The state Farm Bureau [opposes the bill](https://mfbf.net/file/95/WhitePaper2023_FinalFinal316-1.pdf) because of the overtime changes, but is [open to doing away](https://mfbf.net/file/93/Policy%20Book%202023.pdf) with lower minimum wage, saying most farms pay [much more](https://mfbf.net/file/47/NewsandViews_AugSept2021Web.pdf). A sponsor of the bill, state Sen. Adam Gomez, of Springfield, said the proposal does not currently have momentum on Beacon Hill. \"The conversation is still ongoing and moving. There's no dead-set kind of moving forward that we're going to see any kind of traction with the Legislature on this bill,\" Gomez said in an interview. \"But we want to make sure that were still advocating for the ... voices of the voiceless.\" Gomez acknowledged these are not easy times for farm owners given this year's flooding. But he noted the state has provided millions of dollars in relief, and wants to make sure that aid also reaches agriculture's lowest-paid workers. NEPM's Elizabeth Román contributed to this report.",

Severe thunderstorms have eased across eastern Australia but are expected to redevelop around eastern Queensland and northeast NSW from December 30 into the New Year. Parts of Australia are set to face wet and potentially wild weather on New Years Eve and New Year's Day. BoM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms are possible for parts of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible in Queensland between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" Ms Scully said. \"Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia.\" Showers and storms are possible across parts of southern and eastern Australia, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria on December 29. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend concentrating in north-east NSW, and south-east and central Queensland. BoM said there are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday. BoM has encouraged the community to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings using the BOM Weather app and website. Queensland will also experience heatwave conditions along the east coast affecting Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and areas surrounding Cairns. Northern and Western Australia will also face heatwave conditions with temperatures reaching the mid to high 40 degree Celsius in some areas. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "title": "Google NotebookLM Can Now Try to Find Sources for You",
    "text": "NotebookLM, the AI-powered notebook and research tool with Google Gemini, just received yet another update. Google has added 'Discover sources' as a new option to help you find sources for whatever you're working on.\nWith the new Discover Sources feature in NotebookLM, users can now do web searches directly within the app, saving time and effort. The new 'Discover' button can be found in the Sources pane next to the 'Add' button. When users click this button, a search box will appear that asks them to describe their topic of interest. After entering a topic, NotebookLM's advanced search engine, powered by Google's Gemini technology, kicks into action.\nNotebookLM then searches the web and collects possible sources related to the user’s request. The app then uses advanced algorithms to review these sources and pick the most relevant and credible ones, considering factors like content quality and how well they match the topic. The outcome is a curated list of up to ten recommended sources, presented clearly.\nEach source comes with a short, annotated summary that explains its relevance to the user's query, making it easy to assess and choose. This annotation feature greatly cuts down the time needed to sort through many search results, focusing on those most useful to the user.\nUsers can fully control which sources they want to add to their NotebookLM project. They can select all ten recommended sources at once or pick the ones that suit their needs best. Once added, these sources integrate seamlessly into the NotebookLM ecosystem and are ready for use in features like Audio Overviews, FAQs, and Q&A functions.\nThis should make a more efficient workflow and allow users to utilize their new sources within existing projects without interruption. Moreover, these sources stay accessible in the notebook for later review, citation, and note-taking. For newcomers or those seeking inspiration, Google will also add an 'I'm Feeling Curious' button. This is found beneath the text field and generates sources for random topics.\nGoogle is using its advanced Gemini AI model to operate NotebookLM. Gemini’s powerful abilities let NotebookLM execute complex web searches, analyze results, and curate highly relevant sources quickly. This strong engine provides a level of accuracy and efficiency that surpasses traditional search methods.\nRelated\nGemini's New Canvas Feature is The Ultimate Writing/Coding Buddy\nWhile you probably don't want a whole program written by AI, it can help you come up with solutions in specific snippets so your code is more efficient and functional. If you're going to do that, though, you might as well use it with Gemini's Canvas—it will make it way easier to check if that code actually works.\nIf you use Wordtune, then the library feature seems very similar to this. Unfortunately, Wordtune's feature tends to mess up a lot and needs constant updates, but it seems like NotebookLM is doing so well that it's adding more features. You'll need a Google One AI plan if you want more of these advanced features from NotebookLM. I wouldn't say you need it unless you work in an environment where you use the same sources repeatedly.\nEven still, this update is a major advancement in the app’s capabilities. I don't doubt that finding sources is a time-consuming process. Researching on its own takes a while, but this should make it easier. However, Google isn't always the most reliable, so I would be careful of just trusting whatever sources it puts in front of you.\nIt's always best to do independent research and double-check what you're given. Things like these tend to take everything given to them as fact, and websites aren't always correct. It's still good to start researching, and you can always add more sources, so be on the lookout for the rollout, which should be coming in a week. You can check it out from the official NotebookLM website.\nSource: Google",

    "title": "Star Trek: Emissary Opening Credits Gives Fans Everything They Want",
    "text": "Star Trek: Emissary Opening Credits Gives Fans Everything They Want\nNo franchise does cool fan productions quite like\nStar Trek. over the years, we’ve been treated to fan films like Star Trek: Of Gods and Men that bring back some of the actors from The Original Series and ambitious series like Star Trek: Continues that completely recast the iconic original crew.\nNow, Deep Space Nine superfans David Frank and Christian Lerch have used their extensive experience in motion graphics to create the ultimate love letter to the\nbest Trek series of all. Below, you can view their killer trailer for Emissary, an imaginary Trek show named after the DS9 pilot episode.\nEven though this trailer for Star Trek: Emissary is focused on teasing a series that might have come out decades ago, it clearly takes its design inspiration from Star Trek: Picard. One of the better aspects of that official show on\nParamount+ was that it integrated elements (past, present, and future) of Picard’s life to create a trailer that felt very intimate.\nAfter viewing this amazing trailer, we’ve only got one question for Paramount: when are we getting a Picard-style show featuring Benjamin Sisko?\nEmissary’s trailer does the same thing regarding the life of Deep Space Nine’s Benjamin Sisko, and that means it is filled with great Easter eggs for fans to discover.\nFor example, near the beginning of the Star Trek: Emissary trailer, we can see an image of the Earth transformed into a baseball, symbolizing how baseball superfan Sisko keeps a ball on his desk as a memento of home.\nThere are some cute textual gags thrown in, including the fact that the fictional show is presented by “Terok Nor Television.” As Trek fans can tell you, Terok Nor was the official Cardassian name for the space station before\nStarfleet rechristened it “Deep Space Nine.”\nThe trailer for Star Trek: Emissary also draws inspiration from the most traumatic moment in Sisko’s life. At one point, we can see a Miranda-class vessel flying towards Picard’s head from when he was transformed into the evil\nLocutus of Borg. This is a reference to the ship Sisko served on (the USS Saratoga) during the Battle of Wolf 359, and his wife was killed during this infamous battle against the Borg.\nEven though this trailer for Star Trek: Emissary is focused on teasing a series that might have come out decades ago, it clearly takes its design inspiration from Star Trek: Picard.\nLater in the Star Trek: Emissary trailer, we can see the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards last glimpsed in the first season of\nPicard. This is where Sisko worked and recovered after the loss of his wife, and it’s where he helped design his future ship the USS Defiant, which also makes an appearance in the trailer.\nBeyond the details of Sisko’s own life, the trailer also includes beautiful glimpses of his future life with the Bajoran people, including a look at a Prophet (or “wormhole alien”) as well as one of the special orbs the Prophets sent to the Bajoran people.\nThe Star Trek: Emissary trailer ends with a glimpse of Sisko surrounded by the familiar white light that indicates he is speaking with the Prophets. These\naliens are nonlinear, and that’s certainly appropriate to the trailer: Sisko’s interactions with the Prophets while reluctantly serving as their Emissary is one of the narrative through points that connect the very beginning of Deep Space Nine to the very end.\nAfter viewing this amazing trailer (and believe us, these are just a few of the awesome Easter eggs), we’ve only got one question for Paramount: when are we getting a Picard-style show featuring Benjamin Sisko?\nAt this point, we’re ready to start praying to the Prophets if that’s the only way to bring\nAvery Brooks back to this franchise.",
