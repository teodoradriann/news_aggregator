    "title": "Romain Pison's Novi Glamping: Where Sustainable Luxury Meets Nature",
    "text": "Have you ever felt life was moving too fast, making it hard to connect with what truly matters? Romain Pison, an entrepreneur and the founder of Novi Glamping, knows that feeling all too well. Born and raised in the mountains of France, Romain grew up surrounded by nature's purest beauty—long hikes, crisp mountain air, and the serenity of the outdoors were just part of daily life. However, as he moved to urban environments, the connection to nature faded, replaced by the rush of city living.\nThis personal journey is only part of the story. For over a decade, Romain Pison has been deeply involved in sustainable development projects across the globe, from agroforestry initiatives in Africa to carbon offsetting projects in Scotland. His expertise in environmental projects has driven his passion for sustainable tourism, and he has dedicated his career to balancing environmental impact with economic viability. This wealth of experience has directly shaped the vision for Novi Glamping, where ecotourism meets luxury in a way that respects the environment without compromising comfort.\nRomain wasn’t alone in his quest to reconnect with nature. Friends, colleagues, and countless others shared his longing for a peaceful retreat, yet many were reluctant to give up the comforts of modern life. This shared desire inspired him to create Novi Glamping, a company specializing in luxurious and unique glamping experiences that offer a perfect blend of nature and comfort. Novi Glamping provides luxury short-term rentals in beautiful natural settings just outside urban areas, designed to offer a peaceful, off-grid escape with all the modern amenities, without the sense of being isolated or secluded. Each site is carefully chosen to ensure tranquility while remaining connected to the conveniences of nearby towns. Learn more at www.noviglamping.com.\n\"NoviGlamping isn't just about camping; it's about reconnecting with nature and each other,\" says Romain Pison, CEO and Founder of Novi Glamping. \"We wanted to create spaces that bring people closer together, away from screens and schedules, in a setting that’s both natural and luxurious, but never too far from where life happens.\"\nRomain's vision for Novi Glamping emerged from a personal need—he and his wife were searching for ways to reconnect with nature without compromising on the sophisticated comforts they loved. Frustrated by the lack of high-quality options in the U.S., they decided to create their own. More than just luxury tents, Novi Glamping provides thoughtfully designed spaces where guests can fully immerse themselves in nature while enjoying a refined and elevated experience.\nThe first NoviGlamping site is set to open in Spring 2025 in Virginia, nestled in the serene Shenandoah National Park, and less than two hours from Washington DC. This location will provide guests with a unique retreat where nature meets sophistication, all within reach of vibrant communities. The second location will open just two hours from Los Angeles, bringing the ultimate glamping experience near Joshua Tree National Park. Both sites are perfect for those who crave a reconnection with nature, but without sacrificing the comforts and luxuries of modern life. The other planned locations include the Catskills, less than two hours from New York.\nRomain's journey from sustainable development to eco-tourism highlights his dedication to creating meaningful, responsible travel experiences. \"Sustainability isn't just a buzzword; it's a way of life,\" Romain explains. \"Through Novi Glamping, we aim to make eco-luxury-tourism accessible, stylish, sophisticated, and deeply connected to nature, but always mindful of our environmental footprint.\"\nThe Novi Glamping experience is more than just an escape; it's an opportunity to reconnect with nature, yourself, and the people around you. Whether it’s a weekend getaway or a longer stay, Romain Pison’s expertise has ensured that each Novi Glamping site offers not only a luxurious retreat but also a commitment to sustainability.\nRomain Pison's innovative approach to blending luxury, nature, and sustainability through Novi Glamping showcases his vision for eco-tourism as more than just a trend but a lasting way to reconnect with what matters most. So, when was the last time you truly felt connected to the outdoors or the people around you? Perhaps it's time to rediscover that balance with Novi Glamping—where peace and connection meet, without ever feeling out of touch with the world.\n*The San Francisco Weekly newsroom and editorial were not involved in the creation of this content.",

    "title": "Slain mother told 911 dispatcher she was trying to leave Clinton Twp. home",
    "text": "Jordan Wheeler was trying to leave her and her estranged husband’s Clinton Township house with her two young sons last fall when Steven Wheeler shot her multiple times in the head.\nA six-minute recording of Jordan Wheeler’s 911 call was played in a courtroom Thursday at the preliminary examination for Steven Wheeler, 30, who is charged with first-degree murder and felony firearm possession for fatally shooting Jordan Wheeler near the front door in the home with the boys nearby.\n“He put his hands on me. I have it on video,” she tells Macomb County Sheriff’s dispatcher Taryn Grady. “I’m trying to get my kids stuff so I can get out of here. I’m trying to get my kids out of here. I also believe he has been drinking.”\nAsked by Grady to describe what happened minutes before, Jordan says, “He grabbed me and tried to push me out of the home,” she tells the dispatcher.\nSteven Wheeler can be heard in the background denying it, and Jordan says, “It’s on video.” That video on her phone was shown in court.\nThe dispatcher then asks whether “he has guns.”\n“Yes, he has guns” that are “somewhere in the house, probably in the bedroom,” Jordan replies.\nThe dispatcher moments later asks, “How many children are in the home?”\nBut Jordan doesn’t answer and five seconds later four or five gunshots are heard on the recording.\nGrady repeatedly asks, “What is going on?”\nSteven Wheeler twice yells from afar, “I shot her in the f—— head,” and then says, “I’m done. I put her out.”\nMinutes later Wheeler was arrested by Clinton Township police officers in front of the house on Woodward Street near 15 Mile Road and Groesbeck Highway.\nJordan Wheeler’s phone was found outside, brought there by the defendant, according to testimony.\nSteven Wheeler was bound over to Macomb Circuit Court on first-degree murder and felony firearm possession following the hearing in front of Judge Steven Sierawski in 41A District Court in Sterling Heights although the case is under 41B District Court jurisdiction. The three judges at the Clinton Township court recused themselves because Jordan Wheeler is the sister of Kelly Femmineo, the wife of 41B Judge Jacob Femminineo. The case was reassigned to the Sterling Heights court.\nBrett Vanderpool, Jordan Wheeler’s brother, said after the hearing the family approves of the ruling.\n“First-degree (murder) is absolutely correct,” he said. “It’s all we have on our mind right now. We won’t settle for anything else.\n“He’s a monster. He’s an evil human being. He needs to face what he’s done.”\nVanderpool praised his 10-year-old nephew, Colton Wheeler, for taking the stand.\n“Colton was as brave as they come,” he said. “He stood right in the face of the monster that took away the most precious thing of his life and told the story, the truth, of his mother.”\nBut the family wished Colton didn’t have to testify, Vanderpool added.\n“I think all of our hearts break seeing his child on the stand,” he said. “A child shouldn’t have to experience that.”\nThe hearing was attended by the Femminineos and several other family members.\nThe judge’s ruling followed arguments at which Assistant Macomb Prosecutor Kelsey Heath said first-degree murder should stick because Wheeler had time for a “second look” to reconsider his decision to shoot his wife as she was about to exit the front door.\n“He walked up right behind her and shot her five times,” Heath said. “He fired till there was no bullets. She was on the phone to leave.”\nSierawski denied a request by Wheeler’s attorney, Noel Erinjeri, to reduce the charge to second-degree murder despite contending.\n“There was no second look,” Erinjeri said. “He is in an argument.”\nErinjeri said if his client had time to think about it, he wouldn’t have shot Jordan while she was still on the phone with law enforcement.\nTwo of the couple’s three children were at the home that night, last Oct. 19, as part of Steven Wheeler’s parenting time with them after the couple had separated and were in the midst of divorce proceedings in Macomb Circuit Court. Jordan Wheeler and her children were living with Kelly and Jacob Femminineo.\nColton testified he and his brother called their mother at about 9:30 p.m. because their dad threw a tablet computer at one of them in anger. Steven Wheeler also had knocked a hole in a wall in a hallway in the home.\n“Like a good mom, she goes right over there,” Heath said during her arguments.\nWhile their mom was on the 911 call, the two boys ran from the home carrying things, one a few seconds after the other, less than 30 seconds before the shooting, according to ring camera video shown in court. One of boys was still on the porch when the shots from the .45-caliber handgun were fired, and gun flashes can be seen in the video.\nJordan Wheeler’s body was found against the living room couch with a pool of blood under her, police officers testified. She was wearing a T-shirt, jacket, pajama pants and slippers, they said.\nOne officer testified he saw two wounds, one to her face, under her left eye, and the other on the left side of her head.\nAt the township police station, Wheeler admitted to killing his wife in two interviews about five and 15 hours after the incident, according to township Detective Jay Anderson.\nWheeler agreed to waive his Miranda right to an attorney at the first interview though Anderson said he appeared intoxicated. Anderson said Wheeler told him his intoxication did not affect his memory after the incident.\nAbout 10 hours later, Wheeler gave his Miranda consent though his blood-alcohol level showed a slight intoxication level at 0.032%. Wheeler again made admissions and changed his prior statement that he was cleaning the gun when Jordan arrived. He admitted he retrieved it from the bedroom, and Anderson said he found the gun case on the floor and a empty slot on a shelf in the closet that could’ve been the gun’s storage spot.\nWheeler is scheduled for a May 13 arraignment by Judge Julie Gatti in Macomb County Circuit Court in Mount Clemens.\nHe remains held it he county jail without bond.",

    "title": "Maine continues to see high hepatitis C infections despite overall declining rate",
    "text": "For nearly a decade the rate of new acute hepatitis C infections in Maine has increased dramatically, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The national average has also increased. Figures are per 100,000 population.\nMaine has consistently had the highest rate of new acute hepatitis C infections in the nation going back to 2020, however there may be more factors to consider when looking at why it’s so high, such as the state’s push to get more people tested and the rise of injectable drug use.\nHepatitis C causes liver inflammation, and can cause liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer and premature death.\nFor several years, Maine’s infection rate was relatively low, though still higher than the national average. In 2019, the rate almost doubled from 1.7 cases per 100,000 population in 2018 to 3.2 cases, according to data on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.\nThat rate ballooned to 11.9 cases in 2020, much higher than the national average’s 1.3 cases per 100,000 population that year, according to CDC data. Hepatitis C infections have also been rising nationally over the years but not to the same level as Maine.\nNew infections started increasing nationally about 25 years ago when the opioid crisis began, according to Dr. Dora Mills, MaineHealth public health physician and chief health improvement officer.\nWith the rise of opioid use, the practice of injecting drugs also increased, which is one of the primary ways hepatitis C is contracted, she said. Maine is one of the hardest hit states by the opioid epidemic.\n“We know that hepatitis C infections have increased across the county the last 20 years due to opioid crisis, because the opioid crisis has led to a lot of injectable drug use and injectable drug use is one way that hepatitis C is transmitted,” she said.\nOther common ways of infection are through blood products, blood to blood contact, and a baby can contract the virus from its mother during birth, Mills said. More people die of hepatitis C than AIDS/HIV. Hepatitis C symptoms can begin within weeks or months after exposure.\nTesting for the virus was also less common two decades ago and it was not as readily available to people, she said.\nIn 2020, the CDC expanded its recommendation of who should get tested, according to Maine Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Jackie Farwell. It now recommends that everyone be tested at least once in their lifetime for hepatitis C and AIDS/HIV, and people with higher risk factors should be tested frequently. Pregnant people should be tested with each pregnancy. This combined with more available testing has led to an increase in testing, according to Mills. Though she does not know the exact reason why the rate of new infections increased, Mills said she thinks these two factors played a big role.\n“In Maine, I think we did a particularly good job of testing,” she said. “So, the health systems, the community health centers and … public health – Maine CDC – have worked very closely together the last 10 years or so to make sure that people do get tested. So, I think we’ve had very good success in testing.”\nHowever, since 2020 that new acute infection rate has decreased every year, down to 6.8 cases per 100,000 population in 2022, which is the most recent data, according to information on the CDC’s website.\nState estimates place the 2023 rate of new acute infections in Maine at 5.6 cases per 100,000, with a 39% decrease in the overall number of new infections compared to 2022, according to Maine Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Lindsay Hammes.\nHowever, state and federal infection rate data cannot be compared exactly because both gather infection data differently, Hammes said. State data includes probable infections whereas federal data only counts confirmed cases. Confirmed cases are determined through RNA testing, whereas positive antibody tests are considered probable cases.\nMills said she thinks the state is seeing a decrease in overall new acute infections since 2020 because many people have already been tested, resulting in fewer people who need testing. She also thinks a modest decrease in illicit drug use, an increase in administering treatments and the cure, along with an increase in resources for safe use, such as Syringe Service Programs, have attributed to the decline.\nThe number of drug overdose deaths has decreased in the past couple of years, which could indicate that fewer people are using illicit drugs, she said.\nNearly a decade ago if someone tested positive for the virus they had it for the rest of their lives, but now there is a treatment that cures people of the virus, she said. There are also many more programs around the state that give people using injectable drugs clean needles. It makes them less likely to reuse needles, which leads to a higher risk of contracting the virus.\nIt is important to give people the tools to help them stay healthy – even if they use illicit substances – for their own health and to protect others, she said. If there are fewer people who have higher risk factors with the hepatitis C virus in Maine then people in the general population who do not have high risk factors are less likely to contract the disease as well.\n“It reduces the transmission amongst those who are drug addicted, who use … injectable drugs as well as everybody else,” she said.\nSymptoms of acute hepatitis can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain and jaundice, according to a May 30, Maine Department of Health and Human Services news release .\nDHHS recommends people talk to their health care providers about being tested, get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B, and wash their hands frequently. Maine provides a confidential online form that can connect people to a hepatitis navigator to seek testing and treatment.",

    "text": "David Fink follows a line of straw and uses a baler in one of his fields Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2023, at Heidel Hollow Farm in Germansville.\nFive Lehigh Valley farms, totaling more than 230 acres, will be preserved under a state investment program that protects them from future residential or commercial development.\nGov. Josh Shapiro’s office recently announced that more than 1,500 acres on 22 farms in 11 counties were part of a $5.8 million investment using state, county and local funds.\nPennsylvania partners with county and local governments and nonprofits to buy development rights so farm owners ensure their farms will remain farms and never be sold to developers.\nLehigh County ranks fourth statewide in the number of farms preserved and is fifth in total acreage. It expects the 400th farm to be preserved this spring. According to the county’s website, 397 farms covering more than 27,600 acres have been preserved.

    "text": "Pharmacies across the country will cease activities this Friday . It will be at noon and will be accompanied by a summons to the Courts to file an injunction against Javier Milei's DNU which, among its numerous articles, also deregulates pharmaceutical activity.\nThis was announced by the Argentine Pharmaceutical Confederation (COFA). The appeal will be to stop the implementation of the decree of necessity and urgency that the President presented in a message broadcast on national television. \"It puts the health of Argentines in extreme vulnerability,\" they said about the consequence of the DNU on their activity.\nThe presentation, according to the president of the entity, Ricardo Pesenti, will be accompanied by a rally in front of the Palace of Courts, in the center of Buenos Aires, while pharmacies will close their shutters for an hour, starting at noon.\n\"This is not a political measure. In fact, many pharmacists voted for this government . However, we believe that there is a lack of knowledge of the serious consequences that this DNU brings,\" Pesenti said.\nPharmacies will have shutters down between 12 and 13. Photo: Fernando de la Orden\nThe presentation of the amparo measure will take place this Friday at 13 p.m. It will be done with a rally in front of the Palace of Courts, in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of San Nicolás, next to the cessation of activities in pharmacies throughout the country, between 12 and 13.\n\"With the false argument of lowering the price of medicines, the DNU leads to the destruction of the pharmaceutical profession, undermining 20 articles of Law 17,565 on professional practice,\" the Pharmaceutical Confederation said in a statement.\nWhat does the DNU say? DNU 70/2023, through the amendment of Law 17,565, eliminates the requirement that \"medicines called over-the-counter and pharmaceutical specialties, regardless of their condition of dispensing, may only be carried out throughout the territory of the Nation, in authorized pharmacies\".\nIt also leaves out the text that specified that \"so-called over-the-counter medicines must be dispensed personally at the counter by pharmacists or people authorized to dispense them,\" COFA said.\nDue to Milei's DNU, there will also be changes in pharmacies. Photo: Rafael Mario Quinteros\nAt the same time, the measure dictated by the Government opens the door to the sale of medicines in other shops. This is determined by annulling the provisions of the law, which stated that \"the sale and dispatch outside these establishments is considered illegal practice of pharmacy and, without prejudice to the penalties established by law, those who carry it out may be denounced for infringement of the Penal Code\".\n\"It also leads to the end of pharmacies that are in the most remote neighborhoods, in the villages, benefiting the chains that are concentrated in the large urban centers,\" the entity detailed.\nIn addition, he warned that, with these measures, \"medicines are not going to go down in price, because the price is set by the laboratories, not the pharmacies.\" And he added: \"What is going to happen is that the health of Argentines is made extremely vulnerable by removing sanitary controls on medicines.\"\n\"If there are deviations in quality, manufacturing problems, adulteration or counterfeiting, there is going to be no way to detect it in a timely manner or to withdraw those products from the market,\" he said.\n\"Pharmacists are essential, especially today, in a context of crisis in the health system, with an increasing demand for care. We provide fundamental services such as blood pressure control, application of vaccines, injectables, cures, medication management,\" COFA concluded.\nWith information from Télam\nAGE",
