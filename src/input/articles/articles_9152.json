    "text": "Le contenu local de l’éolien rebondit à l’Assemblée nationale Hydro-Québec s'apprête à augmenter considérablement la production éolienne. (Photo d'archives) Photo : Radio-Canada / Sandra Fillion Interpellée par l’opposition sur le contenu québécois de la filière éolienne, la Coalition avenir Québec n’a ni confirmé ni infirmé son intention de ne pas exiger de contenu québécois et local dans la fabrication d’éolienne et la construction des futurs parcs d’Hydro-Québec. La députée de l’opposition, Marwa Rizqy, et son collègue, Enrico Siccone, ont talonné le ministre délégué à l’Économie, Christopher Skeete, jeudi matin, sur la question du contenu québécois dans le développement de la filière éolienne. Tandis que de nombreux parcs éoliens ont été construits avec des obligations contractuelles sur les exigences de contenu québécois et régional, l’ex-ministre de l’Énergie, Pierre Fitzgibbon, [n’aurait pas fixé de telles conditions](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2080289/energie-eolienne-hydro-quebec-projets), et ce, dans un contexte où Hydro-Québec veut augmenter considérablement sa capacité de production d’énergie éolienne. Cette semaine, le député de Gaspé, Stéphane Sainte-Croix, a indiqué que la CAQ n’envisageait pas d’aller de l’avant avec l’imposition de critères sur la fabrication et la construction des parcs. En Chambre, jeudi, la députée Marwa Rizqy a repris une question du conseiller municipal de Gaspé, James Keays tandis que Enrico Ciccone a relayé la demande du maire de Gaspé, Daniel Côté, d’inclure des clauses d’approvisionnement local dans les appels d’offres d’Hydro-Québec. Est-ce que le député de Gaspé peut se lever et expliquer pourquoi il laisse tomber son monde?, a demandé Enrico Ciccone. C’est le ministre délégué à l’Économie, Christopher Skeete, qui a finalement répondu en mettant de l’avant les différentes initiatives de son gouvernement pour favoriser l’achat local, mais sans répondre directement aux questions des deux députés libéraux. On s’apprête à doubler le parc éolien québécois et on se dit : Ah non! C’est correct, on va prendre des pales qui vont venir d’ailleurs, peut-être de Chine. Alors, je cite le maire de Gaspé : Encourager l’économie chinoise, il y a une limite à ça aussi , a conclu à la fin des échanges, la députée libérale Marwa Rizky Cet avis est partagé par le député de Matane-Matapédia, Pascal Bérubé, qui qualifie la position de la CAQ d’inacceptable. Ceux qui vont faire de l’argent sont en Asie et en Europe et on laisse tomber une donnée élémentaire qui s’appelle le nationalisme économique. Ça inquiète beaucoup de monde dans l’industrie , dit-il. [Plusieurs voix en faveur du retour du contenu local dans la production éolienne](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2080578/eolienne-energie-renouvelable-turbine-marmen) se sont aussi fait entendre lors du Colloque sur les énergies renouvelables en juin dernier à Carleton-sur-Mer.

    "title": "EPA Unveils New Detection Methodology to Combat PFAS Contamination in Plastic Containers",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking stride toward safeguarding public and ecological health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has unveiled a new detection methodology to identify the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in plastic containers. This innovative approach, capable of detecting PFAS contamination at the minuscule concentration of 0.002 parts-per-billion, represents a pivotal development in the ongoing battle against these hazardous chemicals. The revelation comes amidst escalating concerns over the ubiquity of PFAS, often dubbed 'forever chemicals', due to their persistent nature and potential to wreak havoc on marine ecosystems and human health alike.\nUnveiling the Invisible Threat\nThe EPA's latest methodological breakthrough enables the direct detection of 32 PFAS compounds from the walls of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers. This proactive measure is part of a comprehensive strategy to stem the tide of PFAS infiltration into the environment. By issuing orders to halt the production of PFAS-laden products and providing testing data on pesticide products, the EPA aims to ensure that these items do not harbor PFAS residues. Furthermore, the agency has taken decisive action by removing 12 PFAS chemicals from the list of approved inert ingredients in nonfood pesticide products, while also assessing the leaching potential of PFAS from HDPE containers into stored liquids.\nA Call to Arms Against 'Forever Chemicals'\nThe urgency of addressing PFAS contamination is underscored by findings from environmental analytical chemists at Florida International University, which reveal the permeation of these chemicals into Biscayne Bay, Florida. Major contributors to the presence of PFAS in the bay include failing septic systems, wastewater leaks, and aqueous film-forming foam utilized by military and airport facilities. Although the detected levels of PFAS fall below advisory levels for human health, concerns mount over their sufficiency in protecting marine life and humans consuming fish from the affected waters. This situation highlights the intricate challenge of mitigating the impact of PFAS on marine ecosystems and underscores the necessity for federal and state agencies to establish robust guidelines and action plans.\nCharting a Course Toward Remediation and Awareness\nIn response to the daunting task of identifying and monitoring the thousands of different PFAS structures, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a new database. This repository, containing spectra for 132 PFAS compounds, is poised to play a crucial role in environmental pollution monitoring. By facilitating access to mass spectrometry data, the database aims to empower scientists to detect known and unknown PFAS compounds, thereby advancing efforts in environmental health, toxicology, exposure risk assessment, and remediation efficiency. As a testament to the spirit of collaboration and data sharing within the scientific community, the database is accessible to researchers complete with a user guide for simplified navigation and offline use.\nThe EPA's multifaceted approach to tackling PFAS contamination, from the introduction of a novel detection methodology to the legal actions against companies manufacturing PFAS-contaminated products, reflects a steadfast commitment to using sound science to prevent these chemicals from entering the environment. Coupled with the ongoing efforts to protect marine ecosystems and human health from the adverse effects of PFAS, these initiatives underscore the critical importance of vigilant monitoring, stringent regulatory measures, and public awareness in the quest to mitigate the pervasive threat posed by 'forever chemicals'. As the fight against PFAS contamination advances, the collective resolve of regulatory agencies, scientists, and the community at large will be paramount in safeguarding our environmental and public health legacy.",

    "title": "This Is What to Do When Your Boyfriend Talks to You Like A Crap",
    "text": "A perfectly healthy relationship is when couples are able to communicate smoothly with each other. Arguments are okay but when your boyfriend starts to speak to you in an offensive way, it's time to think over the relationship. Nobody wants to be talked to in a crap way, especially a girlfriend. But is your boyfriend doing this to you? Check out all these things that you have to do when your boyfriend talks to you like crap.\nContents\n1. Tell Him that You Don’t Like It The first thing to do when your boyfriend talks to you like crap is to tell him. He has to know that you don’t like it. You must be honest because he can’t read your mind. Take some time to talk seriously with him. Here are some ideas on things to say to your boyfriend when he's being a jerk to help you out.\nThe sooner the better, don’t wait until it gets worse. Your feelings matter in the relationship so tell him that the way he talks to you is not okay at all.\n2. Ask Him to Change the Way He Talks to You What to do when your boyfriend talks to you like a crap? Telling your boyfriend about how you feel might not be enough. You also have to ask him to change the way he talks to you. Even if he says that he will, pay attention to his changes because actions speak louder than words. If he cares about you then he will make an effort to change. But here's how to tell your boyfriend you don't like something he does effectively.\n3. Help Him to Become Better You can also help your boyfriend to become better in terms of how he talks to you. Encourage him to change his behaviour. Based on psychology, positive response will make someone believe that they’re on the right path. Appreciate any positive effort that he makes. However, your boyfriend may not like this. But that’s how you know if he really loves you. A boyfriend who cares about his girlfriend will feel bad and change his bad habits for her.\n4. Look at the Situation The next thing that you can do when your boyfriend talks to you like crap is to assess the situation. Does talk to you like when he’s in a certain mood or all the time? Did you do something that made him upset or angry? Here's all the blessed things to say to your boyfriend when he's having a bad day which may help your situation.\nIf it’s a one-time thing then you can give him another chance. But if it’s something that he does often then you may need to rethink your relationship.\n5. Talk to Someone about It In case you’re confused or upset with how your boyfriend acts, find someone you can talk to. It could be a friend or someone else who is close to you. Having another person’s perspective can really help you out. They can offer you emotional support or give you the advice that you need.\n6. Find Out How He Talks to His Friends What you can also do when your boyfriend talks to you like crap is to observe how he talks to his friends. Is he nicer? Do you think he treats you worse than how he treats his friends? If your answer is yes then there could be something deeper about how he talks to you. You need to figure it out because this is an unfair treatment for a girlfriend. If it's something related with his baby mama, here's what to do when your boyfriend talks to his baby mama everyday .\n7. Give Him the Silent Treatment You can try to give him the silent treatment when you don’t like the way he talks to you. But be cautious because this might fire back to you. Your boyfriend might rethink his actions and decide to change. However, he might become angrier and say more crap things to you.\n8. Threaten Him with a Break Up Only do this as a last resort. When you have no idea what to do, threaten to break up with him if he doesn’t change. This is something that is more extreme than the silent treatment. If he loves you, he will do anything to make you stay. If he doesn’t then he won’t care if you leave. Yeah, that's what to do when your boyfriend talks to you like a crap.\nThis is When You Know You Have to Leave Him Does your boyfriend's words hurt you even more? Take a look at the reasons below on why you need to ditch him:\n1. He Continues His Behaviour When your boyfriend refuses to change, you should leave him. It’s the ultimate thing to do when your boyfriend talks to you like crap. There is only a very small chance that he will stop talking in a very rude way.\n2. He Becomes More Vulgar with His Words Ever notice that your boyfriend uses more vulgar words than ever before? That’s when you have to start thinking about leaving him. According to experts, this could be categorised as verbal abuse. You need to realise that it might only get worse so you have you to leave him as soon as you can.\n3. He Starts to Get Physical Walk away from your boyfriend if he gets physically abusive towards you. You know that’s not right. In case you’re having difficulty leaving him, confide in someone you trust. They could help you get out of the situation.\n4. He Says Sorry but Repeats His Mistake Yes your boyfriend apologized but he keeps making the same mistake. He still talks to you like crap. The truth is, he doesn’t care. His apology will never be sincere. Here are some tips on what to do when boyfriend tells white lies all the time .\n5. You Don’t Feel Loved and Appreciated When your boyfriend talks to you like crap, it will make you feel horrible. You don’t need this. When you don’t feel loved and appreciated by your boyfriend, you need to leave. Find that one person who will love you with all his heart.\n6. You Know You Deserve Better Sometimes there’s a voice inside you that whispers ‘you deserve better’. Listen to it. Don’t pretend as if he’s the best thing in the world. It’s hard but you know you deserve better.\nThink carefully about your relationship when your boyfriend won't stop talking crap to you. Most importantly, listen to your heart.",

    "text": "18-year-old shot after high school graduation in Boston’s Seaport By Kimberly Bookman , Dakota Antelman June 13, 2024 Share\nBOSTON (WHDH) - An 18-year-old was shot and taken to an area hospital Thursday shortly after her high school graduation in Boston’s Seaport neighborhood, officials said.\nPolice responded to the area of 200 Pier 4 Boulevard near 11:45 a.m. after a report of a shooting, according to Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox.\nOnce on scene, Cox said, officers found the teen suffering from non-life-threatening gunshot wounds. She was then rushed to the hospital.\nPolice said the victim had just attended her graduation for Boston Collaborative High School. Though the school was holding a graduation ceremony at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Cox said the shooting did not happen at the graduation itself.\nPolice said that there were two crime scenes Thursday — one inside a parking garage near the museum and another on Pier 4 Boulevard, where a black car involved had parked. Witnesses said the recent high school graduate in the passenger’s seat of the car was shot.\n“I hear, ‘She’s shot,’ and then everybody’s screaming and yelling, and I ran over and I started dialing 911,” said witness Alexa Wirth.\nAnother woman, Sam Miller, also saw the incident.\n“There was blood on their arm, not sure where the gunshot was, but they were pulled out and taken into the stretcher,” Miller said.\nCox said the incident did not appear to be a random event. Though an investigation was ongoing, he said there may have been some sort of altercation before shots rang out.\nCox asked for the public’s support as the investigation continued, urging anyone with information about this incident to reach out to authorities.\n“To say this is an unfortunate incident would be an understatement,” said Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden. “This is a travesty. This should not happen.”\n“High school students attending a graduation on a beautiful day like today shouldn’t have to have that day marked by a shooting taking place and a young woman having to go to the hospital,” Hayden said.\nHayden said authorities were “in the sprawls of an active investigation” and said officials will pursue this case vigorously. He said his office will work to bring the person or people behind this shooting to justice.\n“When you think of the fact that someone is leaving one of the most important days of their lives, in a positive way, to have them come out to now, one of the worst days, I’m sure, of their lives, is really unacceptable in this city,” said state Rep. Russell Holmes, who works nearby in Seaport.\nHe said he saw the aftermath of the shooting.\n“I saw some kids running away, very active, don’t know if they were one of the suspects, but when I pulled up, that’s what caught my attention,” Holmes said.\nHe said the people were wearing caps and gowns.\nSKY7-HD was over the scene near 12:15 p.m. and spotted several police vehicles parked in the area. Police had an entire block of Pier 4 Boulevard taped off near its intersection with Northern Avenue.\nThe shooting happened in a busy part of the Seaport that was bustling with activity near midday. Many onlookers gathered in the area while the police investigation continued.\n“Never in my life did I imagine that there was a shooting here, so this is quite shocking,” said Terrance Flynn, who works in the area.\nAs of 4 p.m., police have not made any arrests and have not recovered the weapon involved.\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

    "text": "El World Economic Forum y la firma de asesoría KPMG han publicado el reporte Circular Industry Solutions for a Global Plastics Treaty , que identifica 24 casos de éxito a nivel global en soluciones para la contaminación por plásticos, con el objetivo de inspirar a los estados miembros de la ONU. Entre los casos seleccionados se encuentra ECOCE A.C., una asociación civil ambiental sin fines de lucro de México , destacada por su contribución al desarrollo de la industria del reciclaje en el país.\nEl informe , que analizó 59 casos de éxito alrededor del mundo, eligió a ECOCE en la categoría de “Reciclaje”. Esta organización, fundada hace veintidós años por la industria de bebidas y alimentos, ha promovido una adecuada gestión de residuos de envases y empaques en México. ECOCE ha sido esencial en el desarrollo del reciclaje de envases de PET , alcanzando una tasa de recuperación del 63%, y administra el Plan Nacional Privado Colectivo de Manejo de Residuos de Envases Post-Consumo de PET, PEAD, Aluminio y otros materiales. Además, trabaja en el reciclaje de empaques flexibles.\nEl Lic. Jorge Terrazas, director general de ECOCE, expresó: “Nos sentimos muy honrados por este reconocimiento. Es el resultado de una gran suma de esfuerzos entre industria, gobierno y sociedad civil, para implementar soluciones de fondo y a largo plazo”.\nEl reporte subraya la importancia de entender las soluciones industriales existentes para implementar una estrategia global efectiva sobre el tratado de plásticos. Destaca la necesidad de políticas públicas bien estructuradas y definiciones claras para abordar la contaminación plástica, la cual es multifactorial. Las acciones de ECOCE, como sus programas de educación y acopio, han promovido el reciclaje y la adecuada separación de residuos sólidos urbanos.\nECOCE reafirma el compromiso de la industria asociada en la transición hacia la circularidad de los plásticos. Se subraya la necesidad de regulaciones armonizadas sobre la gestión de plásticos en México, con objetivos realistas y adecuados para cada región geográfica.\nEn marzo de 2022, 175 países adoptaron una resolución en la Asamblea de Medio Ambiente de la ONU (UNEA-5.2) para desarrollar un instrumento internacional jurídicamente vinculante que aborde la contaminación plástica, incluyendo el medio marino. La última sesión del Comité Intergubernamental de Negociación (INC-5) se llevará a cabo en noviembre de 2024 en Busan, Corea, para redactar la versión definitiva del tratado, que se espera sea adoptado por los estados miembros de la ONU y avance hacia una economía circular de los plásticos.\nSigue leyendo… Claudia Sheinbaum presenta a la tercera parte de su gabinete para asumir la tarea histórica de acompañarla a consolidar el segundo piso de la Transformación",

Meanwhile, Sector 62’s air quality remains moderate, with high PM10 levels posing potential health risks for sensitive groups.\nNoida Fights Triple Fires, Air Quality Dips\nPhoto : PTI\n(Noida: Residents of Noida saw a tense and smoky Wednesday as three massive fires broke out in different parts of the city. Thick plumes of smoke filled the air, reducing visibility and causing panic among locals. Fortunately, no casualties have been reported in any of the incidents.\nSlum Fire Near Sector 63 Called For Emergency Response\nThe first blaze erupted in the Chotpur slum area near Sector 63, sending thick smoke billowing into the sky. Fire officer Pradeep Kumar confirmed that several fire tenders arrived promptly to tackle the flames.\n\"We reached the spot immediately and started controlling the fire. Within half an hour, we managed to bring it under control. Thankfully, no one was injured,\" he said.\nRaging Flames at Dumping Grounds and Expressway\nIn a separate incident, a fire broke out at the Noida Authority’s dumping ground in Sector 32. Strong winds fanned the flames, making them spread rapidly across the landfill. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but emergency teams worked quickly to contain the situation.\nLater in the day, another major fire started at a garbage dump near Sector 128, close to the Greater Noida Expressway. The flames spread to nearby forested areas, alarming residents as thick smoke clouded the roads.\nVideos circulating on social media showed bright orange flames lighting up the night, with smoke hanging heavy in the air. Fire brigades and police rushed to the scene and controlled the situation.\nChief Fire Officer Pradeep Kumar confirmed that all three fires were eventually brought under control. \"The fire has been doused, and our teams are now focusing on cooling operations to prevent any reignition,\" he assured.\nNoida AQI Today\nThe air quality in Sector 62, Noida, is currently moderate, which may cause mild discomfort for sensitive groups. PM2.5 levels, which represent fine dust particles, averaged 52 µg/m³, ranging from 35 to 76 µg/m³. This indicates moderate pollution that could cause minor breathing issues for people with respiratory problems. PM10 levels, which measure larger dust particles, were significantly higher, averaging 119 µg/m³ and reaching a peak of 164 µg/m³, which is a cause for concern as prolonged exposure may impact breathing and overall health. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels were moderate, averaging 21 µg/m³, while Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels remained low at 15 µg/m³, posing no immediate health risks. Ozone (O3) levels were also within safe limits, averaging 45 µg/m³, which does not pose a significant threat. While the overall air quality is not hazardous, sensitive individuals like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory issues may experience discomfort, particularly due to the high PM10 levels.\n(With inputs from news agencies)\nGet\nLatest NewsLive on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines fromMahakumbh 2025,Delhi Election,Noida News,Cityand around the world.Trending:\nAvni Arya author\nAvni's journey at Times Now began in August 2023 after successfully completing a one-month internship.

    "text": "Thursday, June 6th 2024, 5:02 pm State lawmakers are putting pressure on the State Department of Education. House Republicans served State Superintendent Ryan Walters with two subpoenas. Meanwhile, House Democrats are calling for Walters to be impeached. News 9’s Capitol Reporter Haley Weger sat down with Walters to get his response. There are dozens of questions being raised over federal grant funding for Oklahoma schools, contracts of high-paid employees at the State Department of Education, and whether or not Walters has violated state law. There have also been requests kicked up to the Attorney General. Representative Mark McBride (R-Moore), asked AG Gentner Drummond to investigate the employment status of Matt Langston, Walters' Senior Advisor for the administration. In a letter to the AG, Langston was referred to as a possible “ghost employee.” The State Superintendent denied any wrongdoing Thursday, saying if the AG did investigate, he wouldn't find anything out of the ordinary, calling the recent moves an \"attack.\" Walters had much more to say about McBride's accusations. News 9 will have updates on Friday, plus a response from McBride himself. June 6th, 2024 June 6th, 2024",

    "text": "Agartala (Tripura) [India], September 19 (ANI): Tripura has witnessed a significant rise in tourist footfall over the past few years, Chief Minister Manik Saha said on Thursday while addressing a gathering at the inauguration of tourism facilities.\nHe also blamed the previous state governments for not working to increase tourism in the region adequately, saying that they blamed the central government and neglected Tripura.\nAlso Read |\nRG Kar Hospital Rape-Murder Case: Junior Doctors Call Off Protest Partially in Wake of Flood Situation in West Bengal.\n\"The number of tourists is on the rise, and it will continue to increase. People often visit Sikkim, Darjeeling, Meghalaya, and other parts of the Northeast, so why not Tripura? Those who were in power for many years never worked towards promoting Tripura's tourism. They simply blamed the central government and neglected Tripura. There are numerous hidden treasures in the state. Since the BJP formed the government, we have been exploring these hidden spots. We have also introduced the Tripura Tourism Policy to attract investors, and investors are indeed showing interest,\" CM Saha stated.\nWhile addressing a gathering after the inauguration of tourism facilities at the Sulma Dongur Tuisoi Waterfall, located in Sanaiya Reang Para, Dhalai district, he also highlighted that in financial year 2023-24, 4.7 lakh domestic tourists and over 75,000 international tourists visited Tripura.\nAlso Read |\nJPC Meeting on Waqf Amendment Bill 2024: Heated Debate Between Muslim Representatives and Committee Members Over Property Seizure.\nThe Sulma Dongur Tuisoi Waterfall is located at 130 km distance from Agartala.\nThe CM further highlighted that the state has benefited from former Indian Cricket Team captain, Saurav Ganguly, becoming the ambassador for Tripura tourism.\n\"After Saurav Ganguly, the former captain of the Indian cricket team, became the brand ambassador for Tripura Tourism, tourist footfall has increased,\" he added.\nStressing on the importance to use social media for promotion of tourism, he said, \"If we can effectively use social media to promote such attractions, more people will visit. Tripura has many hidden gems that people are unaware of. We are leveraging social media and brand ambassadors to promote Tripura Tourism. More efforts are needed to make Tripura better known.\"\nThe CM also highlighted initiatives like organising light and sound shows, the PRASAD scheme to renovate the Mata Tripura Sundari Temple and the Swadesh Darshan 2.0 scheme.\n\"Additionally, we have organized light and sound shows that highlight the princely regime at Ujjayanta Palace. It is essential to treat tourists from outside Tripura with politeness, ensure their safety, and make them feel welcome. Under the PRASAD scheme, we are renovating the Mata Tripura Sundari Temple, and the work is nearly complete. Once the development work is finished, even more visitors will come. Additionally, under the Swadesh Darshan 2.0 scheme, the development of tourist spots in Agartala and Unakoti has been principally agreed upon,\" he added.\nTourism Minister Sushanta Chowdhury, Dhalai Zila Parishad Sabhadhipati Sushmita Das, MLAs Manoj Kanti Deb and Swapna Das Pal, Tripura Tourism Director Prasant Badal Negi, Dhalai District Magistrate Saju Vaheed, and Dhalai SP Avinash Rai were also present during the inaugration.
