    "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — The City of Columbia kicked off its first Black Maternal Health Week, an idea that was kickstarted by a University of South Carolina student.\nThe goal is to raise awareness about black maternal health in our state while educating women and mothers on the available resources to help advocate and educate themselves during childbirth.\nEbony Christie came up with the idea for the health week. \"I really wanted to shine a light on the issues that are not always talked about,\" she said.\nChristie is a junior public health major currently attending USC. \"One of the biggest things was the black maternal mortality rate across South Carolina,\" she said.\n To get the project rolling, she reached out to Columbia City Councilwoman Aditi Bussells.\n\"Black women are three or four times more likely to die from pregnancy related complications compared to white women,\" Bussells explained.\nDr. Kiri-Claudia Allen Harrington echoed these disparities, which she said happen due to multiple factors including healthcare, underlying chronic conditions, structural racism, and implicit bias.\n\"If we do the advocacy work, and come together and really focus on closing disparities in health care in community resources we won't be having this conversation,\" Harrington said. \"To be honest with you, if we make birthing safer for Black mothers and indigenous mothers and Latino mothers, it will become safer for everyone.\n In order to make birthing safer within the state Dr. Harrington said it will take more than one contributing factor….\n\"Wat are the resources where people are getting education, access to the doctor, fresh foods. and housing security and transportation security, so it's just not one factor.\"\n\"I want young people like myself to know to always be aware, do your research and find something you're passionate about. work hard at it and with that you will be able to make it a bigger issue and bring more awareness and change to that,\" said Christie.\n The events held during Black Maternal Health Week are the following:\nSaturday, April 6 from 11am-3pm - “Mom’s Market”: Health Fair for Moms, Families, and Babies\nLocation: Drew R.

    "text": "Retiran funciones en la iglesia a cura acusado en España de traficar viagra Tras su detención, fue puesto \"en libertad provisional\" por el juez de instrucción. Un cura de una parroquia del oeste de España fue apartado temporalmente de sus funciones por la Iglesia esta semana tras ser implicado por la justicia en un caso de tráfico del estimulante sexual masculino Viagra. El sacerdote de Don Benito, un municipio de 35,000 habitantes de la región de Extremadura, fue detenido el lunes \"por supuesto tráfico de sustancias estupefacientes\", admitió, en un comunicado, la diócesis de Plasencia, de la que depende la parroquia. Tras su detención, fue puesto \"en libertad provisional\" por el juez de instrucción, precisó la diócesis, que expresó su \"dolor y consternación por el sufrimiento y escándalo\" provocado por los hechos. Esperando el \"esclarecimiento\" de lo ocurrido, la diócesis consideró \"conveniente, en este momento, apartarle temporalmente del ejercicio público del ministerio y de su oficio de párroco\". Según informan los medios de comunicación españoles, el sacerdote se dedicaba al tráfico de Viagra y productos afrodisíacos con un hombre descrito como su amante, que también fue detenido durante la operación policial, y desde entonces se encuentra en prisión preventiva. Los dos hombres, que llevaban varios meses bajo vigilancia, utilizaban un apartamento alquilado por el sacerdote para almacenar estos productos, según el diario El Español, que informa de que la noticia causó \"incredulidad\" entre los feligreses.",

    "text": "Independence activist Tony Chung is pictured in a street in Hong Kong, China January 8, 2019. Picture taken January 8, 2019. REUTERS/James Pomfret/File Photo\nBy Kanishka Singh\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) – The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post.\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\nIn November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under the sweeping national security law in 2020 and denied bail.\nBeijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces, and extremism with up to life in prison.\nKEY QUOTES\nThe trauma of detention and continued surveillance left Chung with a feeling of “immense pressure and fear,” compelling him to leave, he told the newspaper.\nChung also said he was made to take part in a compulsory “deradicalization” program in detention.\nGuards “kept telling us (him and others in prison) that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,” Chung was quoted as saying. “We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn’t disagree or argue back.”\nChung was eventually released in June 2023 after his time was reduced for good behavior, according to the Washington Post. He plans to continue his studies and told the Post he will contribute everything he can in exile, “just as before.”\nCONTEXT\nChung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect.\nProsecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home.\nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio)",

    "title": "Lil Wayne Recalls Staggering Amount Of Fan Letters He Received In Jail",
    "text": "Lil Wayne’s 2010 jail stint helped him better understand the impact he had on his fans. The\nprolific rapper reflected on his time behind bars during an appearance on Joel Madden’s Artist Friendly podcast. Weezy mentioned the enormous amount of fan letters he received in jail and how the outpouring of support truly showed him what his music meant to people.\n“I was able to see that through letters when I was locked up,” he told Madden. “I got locked up at the height of my career. Those letters that came in and it was so—just by the amount, plain and simple. Me and the prison, we had to form a process to where you only could get—we’ll give you the mail on a Tuesday and we gotta give it back to your people or something because it would be a fire hazard in my cell. It was over 10,000 [letters] a day.”\nLil Wayne noted how his confinement created a focus on his fans that did not exist when he was a free man. He said the letters provided him with a more personal connection to his fans as opposed to a passing interaction in public.\n“I’m sitting the cell, I ain’t got nowhere to go,” he said. “You’re not catching me walking to a stage or walking off a stage or walking in the mall … I can’t do nothing but sit here and read this letter and pay attention. And one thing about writing a letter, that’s one of the purest forms of showing whatever it is, your expression.”\nLil Wayne spent eight months in the Rikers Island jail after pleading guilty to a felony gun charge. He was released in November 2010. Weezy\npleaded guilty to another gun charge in 2020, but former President Donald Trump pardoned the New Orleans native in 2021.",

    "title": "Congo-Brazzaville: Pointe-Noire - Deux trafiquants de produits de la faune condamnés à deux ans de prison ferme - allAfrica.com",
    "text": "Le Tribunal de grande instance de Pointe-Noire a condamné, le 11 juin, deux trafiquants de produits de la faune pour détention, circulation et commercialisation des trophées d'espèces animales, notamment une peau de panthère et sept pointes d'ivoire, représentant quatre éléphants tués.\nLes deux détenus, Philippe Mboumba et Davy Mancacath, vont purger deux années de prison ferme et écopent d'une amende solidaire d'un million FCFA et de deux millions autres de dommages et intérêts qu'ils verseront à l'Etat congolais. Avant le verdict, plusieurs audiences portant sur cette affaire avaient eu lieu à Pointe-Noire, au cours desquelles ils avaient reconnu les faits qui leur ont été reprochés.\nL'interpellation de ces deux délinquants fauniques avait été effectuée par les agents de la région de gendarmerie de Pointe-Noire, en collaboration avec la direction départementale de l'Economie forestière avec l'appui technique du Projet d'appui à l'application de la loi sur la faune sauvage (Palf). Ces individus avaient été déférés devant le parquet de la République le 13 mai dernier.\nUne source proche de ce dossier rapporte que les deux individus seraient dans un vaste réseau de trafic de produits de la faune. La peau de panthère et les pointes d'ivoire étaient ramenées du district de Madingo-Kayes par l'un d'eux pour être revendues à Pointe-Noire. Il serait également un fournisseur de munitions aux chasseurs. L'autre, quant à lui, l'aiderait dans le trafic de ces produits. Un crâne de gorille a, d'ailleurs, été trouvé exposé dans le salon de sa maison, à l'issue d'une perquisition.\n% Le commerce illégal de produits de la faune conduit à l'extinction des espèces animales sauvages à travers le monde. Le Congo, qui s'est engagé à protéger ses espèces animales en voie d'extinction, reste vigilant et sanctionne tous ceux qui entravent la loi en matière de protection de la faune sauvage.\nLa même source réaffirme que le travail, régulièrement accompli par les autorités dans cette lutte contre la délinquance faunique, produit des effets positifs. Le 31 mai dernier à Brazzaville, deux présumés trafiquants avaient été pris pour ces même délits, à savoir la détention, la circulation et la tentative de commercialisation de deux pointes d'ivoire. La procédure judiciaire inhérente à cette affaire est en cours.\nLire l'article original sur Les Dépêches de Brazzaville .",

    "title": "AI craze driving Nasdaq 100’s best run since 1999: Markets wrap",
    "text": "A banner year for stocks is drawing to a close, with gains in big tech leaving the market near all-time highs amid the artificial-intelligence exuberance and dovish Federal Reserve bets.\nIn the run-up to the final closing bell of 2023, the Nasdaq 100 marched toward its best year since 1999 amid a $7 trillion surge. The S&P 500 approached a record — and is roughly 1% below the average full-year gain predicted in a recent survey with analysts, who forecast the index would end 2024 at 4,833.\n“If the stock market can break through that record high in any significant way as we move through January, it’s going to be very bullish on a technical basis,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co. “Whenever the market is rallying strongly at the beginning of a new year — when a lot of people are adjusting their investment-game plans — it tends to exacerbate the rally.”\nIn a rates-obsessed world, the stock market saw a massive reversal this year after suffering its worst annual selloff since 2008. As traders ramped up bets the Fed is done with its hiking campaign — and will start easing policy in 2024 — global bonds are set for their biggest two-month gain on record.\nThe S&P 500 traded just a few points away from its all-time high of 4,796.56 — extending its 2023 advance to 25%. Treasuries dropped after a weak $40 billion sale of seven-year notes. The dollar rose against most of its developed-market peers. The yen climbed as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda continued to prepare the ground for the nation’s first rate increase since 2007.\nFrom Nvidia Corp. to Microsoft Corp., the seven-largest U.S. tech stocks were responsible for 64% of the gauge’s rally this year through last week as the AI frenzy took off. The Nasdaq 100 is up 55% this year.\nThe ‘Magnificent Seven’ — which also includes\nAmazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post 22% earnings growth next year, twice the S&P 500’s advance, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The key is how much of that is already baked into share prices, especially with expectations for a soft landing building.\n“Companies that have a defined and clear AI strategy with easy-to-follow metrics will likely continue to do well in 2024,” said Michael Landsberg at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Companies that have a hard time explaining their AI value proposition will not see a repeat of 2023, where most large tech was buoyed by the excitement and not necessarily the details of AI.”\nInvestors have flocked to big tech in part on bets that they are best positioned to capitalize on AI due to their vast scale and financial strength.\nThose bigger profits have brought valuations down from nosebleed levels — but they’re still lofty. The Nasdaq 100 is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from a peak of 30 in 2020, it’s well above the average of 19 times over the past two decades.\nAlthough there has been a relatively high number of stocks with gains of over 100%, there haven’t been many outperforming the S&P 500, Bespoke Investment Group noted. In a typical year, on average, 48.7% of the benchmark’s members post larger gains than the index itself. In 2023, less than 30% of its members are outpacing the index.\n“This leads one to question whether the leaders (or laggards) continue to lead (lag) in the year ahead,” the Bespoke strategists said. “Looking at the past, the picture is not exactly favorable for that sort of rotation in either direction.”\nThe market is “sitting on big gains” and most participants just want the year to end to register those gains, according to Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter.\n“But I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that when everyone seems to be leaning on one side of the proverbial canoe, it pays to move to the middle.”\nWarnings about a market that’s flashing overbought signals have been raising concern about a pullback, with some market observers saying that traders have gone too far, too fast in pricing in a dovish Fed pivot.\nWhile the recent ebbing of inflation is positive for the Fed, some other figures showing economic resilience could fuel consumer spending — working against the central bank’s aim to slow the pace of growth. That poses risks for the bond market heading into the new year.\nFalling yields have also driven the dollar lower in 2023, with the greenback on pace for its worst year since the onset of the pandemic. Much of the decline materialized in the fourth quarter on growing wagers that the Fed will sharply loosen policy next year.\nThe drop in Treasury yields has effectively relaxed financial conditions in the U.S. and “are hardly compatible with sustainably low inflation,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote.\n“The rally in the sovereign space looks overdone — hence the rally in stocks and the selloff in the U.S. dollar look overstretched,” she wrote in a note.\nAbout a week ahead of the all-important U.S. jobs report, traders were unfazed by data showing initial jobless claims rose to 218,000. Economists forecast a still-healthy 170,000 increase in December payrolls, consistent with resilient labor demand that has been key in powering the economy.\nElswehere, oil retreated for the fourth time in five sessions as rising inventories at the key U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, partly offset a drop in national stockpiles to paint a mixed picture for demand.\n(With assistance from Richard Henderson, Robert Brand, Jessica Menton, Elena Popina, Ishika Mookerjee, Jeran Wittenstein and Carmen Reinicke.)\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.
