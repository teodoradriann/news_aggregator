    "title": "Non- Brahmin Priest Complaint of Being Banned from Tamil Nadu Temple Entry - The CSR Journal",
    "text": "Two non-Brahmin priests have been appointed at a Tamil Nadu temple to undertake a landmark cast inclusive reform by the state government. The new priests have accused the hereditary priests of barring them from entering the sanctum sanctorum (main complex of the temple), where Lord Murugan recite. The priests also alleged that they have been restricted to performing rituals only in the secondary shrines at the Kumaravayalur Subramania Swamy Temple in Tiruchirapalli. The priests, S Prabhu and Jaipal, were appointed in 2021 after the Tamil Nadu government initiated to open the priesthood to all casts. However, they have never been allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the temples, despite serving for over three years.\nPetition from Priests In a formal petition, addressing Chief Minister MK Stalin and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endorsement (HR&CE) department, Jaipal and Prabhu complained that their inclusion has not been ensured despite legal and administrative backing for their role.\nIn the formal petition, they wrote “We were appointed by the government under a historic scheme that enabled individuals from all castes to become temple priests. But since our appointment on August 14, 2021, we have not been allowed to perform pooja inside the sanctum sanatorium of the presiding deity. Now, with the kumbabishekam scheduled for February 19, we are being completely sidelined.”",

    "text": "Even with a [regulatory crackdown](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/crypto-prices-stabilize-after-plunging-on-sec-crackdown-jitters.html) on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past year, the price of bitcoin rose steadily through most of 2023, and [now sits at around $43,610](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=) — a nearly $18,000 increase in value since September. Bitcoin hit a peak value of around $68,000 in November 2021. But by November 2022, it had lost more than 75% of that value following the collapse of FTX, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. And now, it's bounced back up again. Other popular cryptocurrencies have followed a similar trajectory in what has been a remarkable turnaround for an industry battered by scandal. But why now? A pending decision on cryptocurrency ETFs seems to be driving demand Investors have been buying cryptocurrencies ahead of the [ much-anticipated approval of the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/26/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-may-be-coming-in-january-2024.html), which is expected later in January. Pending approval, a slew of investment firms are expected to offer ETFs, most notably Blackrock, [the largest asset management firm in the world](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/13/how-blackrock-amassed-over-9-trillion-in-managed-assets.html). An ETF is an investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset or index — in this case, bitcoin. The advantage of a bitcoin or crypto ETF is that it would offer a way for investors to benefit from the price movements of bitcoin without owning the cryptocurrency directly. If approved, cryptocurrency ETFs are expected to be traded on traditional SEC-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, [according to CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/04/will-2024-be-the-year-of-the-bitcoin-etf/). That would open up the cryptocurrency market to a wider array of buyers who don't use cryptocurrency exchanges already. In anticipation of ETF approval, investors have been piling back into the market, which has driven up the price of bitcoin. \"It really opens the door for all kinds of demands. And if demand goes up, price goes up,\" says Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC's [Financial Advisor Council](https://www.cnbc.com/advisor-council/). Boneparth holds investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are other factors at play, too. The Federal Reserve has signaled that its [interest rate hike cycle is over](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/fed-interest-rate-decision-december-2023.html), an encouraging sign for the economy as inflation continues to fall. This has made riskier assets like crypto more attractive to investors. Another factor is bitcoin's \"halving,\" which is [expected in April](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/crypto-market-eyes-interest-rates-expected-bitcoin-etfs-2024-2023-12-11/). Halving is a built-in mechanism related to bitcoin mining that periodically reduces token supply. Decreasing the supply of bitcoin is expected to further stoke demand. To break it down, the factors behind the recent surge in bitcoin prices are \"60% bitcoin ETF, 20% halving and 20% economic conditions,\" says Boneparth. However, \"be mindful about the relentless upward [price] movement over the past few months,\" says Owen Lau, executive director at financial services company Oppenheimer & Co. \"A lot of the good news appears to have been priced in.\" Bitcoin remains a risky investment Cryptocurrency is widely seen as a speculative asset that doesn't derive its value from an underlying entity. It's also extremely volatile, sometimes with price fluctuations of 5% to 10% in a single day. There are no guarantees that it will retain any of its current value, either. As such, financial planners typically advise against investing more than you're willing to lose. \"Bitcoin is the best performing asset class in the last 10 years,\" says Boneparth. \"But owning that performance comes with a large amount of risk.\" DON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?

( [WRDW](https://www.wrdw.com/2024/08/07/new-details-emerge-baby-death-that-led-3-arrests/)/Gray News) - Three people were arrested when a baby died after being wrapped in a wet blanket and placed in front of an air conditioner, according to police. According to arrest warrants, 3-month-old Josiah Noel Seright was found unresponsive at a Budget Inn hotel in Augusta, Georgia, early Tuesday. Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen said Josiah was pronounced dead at 2:30 a.m. at the hospital on Tuesday. The three suspects, the baby’s mother, 19-year-old September De’Asia Seright, 42-year-old Diane Lamish Seright and 39-year-old Antonio Bennie Nash were charged with felony murder and child cruelty in the second degree. According to arrest warrants, Josiah was wrapped in a wet blanket in his car seat in the hotel bathroom while September Seright was in the shower. September Seright then placed Josiah in front of the air conditioner, set at 61 degrees, “for an unknown amount of time” while she was lying on a couch and the other two suspects were lying in a bed, according to the arrest warrants.

    "title": "LG unveils new AI robot 'companion' that promises to boost your mood | Tom's Guide",
    "text": "LG is kicking off its CES extravaganza with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a “Zero Labor Home.”\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for issues, watch your pet and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience. And with help from Qualcomm’s Robotics RB5 Platform , it uses artificial intelligence to learn your interests and behaviors, and get better over time at serving as a friendly home robot.\nIn a statement , LG called its robot a “moving smart home hub” and said that it’s designed to “free customers from household chores.” And at first blush, it seems to do just that.\nThe robot, which will debut at CES 2024 next week, is able to connect to all of your smart home devices and even switch them off if they’re not in use or you’re not home. And speaking of when you’re not home, the device is capable of moving from room to room to identify whether windows are closed or lights are on and send you notifications to let you know.\nAdditionally, LG said that its robot is intelligent enough to monitor your pets while you’re away and allow you to access real-time video to see what they’re up to when you’re not home. And just in case you’re worried about your furnace not working, the robot can analyze your home’s temperature, humidity and indoor air quality, and let you know when something is awry.\nHelpful or creepy?\n(Image credit: LG) But it’s when you return home that the cute little robot turns, well, a bit creepy. According to LG, its device can greet you at the door and will analyze your face, the sound of your voice, and other information to assess your emotional state. It’ll then play music or other audio to boost your mood. Oh, and if you happen to be someone who forgets your medication schedule, it can keep that in line, too.\nIn order to achieve all this, LG’s robot has a host of components, including a camera, speaker and sensors that can help it assess indoor air quality and other things going on around the house. And with help from voice- and image-recognition software, along with natural language processing, it can identify problems as they happen.\nThe robot is part of a broader push by LG to expand its smart home lineup with products that take you out of the equation. Indeed, the robot is just one of what LG has promised would be a steady lineup of devices that aim at that Zero Labor Home concept.\nBut whether you’ll want to have a robot following you (and your dog) around the house all day is hard to say. LG plans to showcase the robot at its CES booth next week. The company didn’t reveal pricing or availability.",

    "text": "Un sacerdote de Florida es investigado por morder la mano de una feligresa durante la Eucaristía dominical en un supuesto “intento de defender la Comunión”, según la declaración jurada del caso citada este viernes por medios estadounidenses. El incidente ocurrió el pasado 19 de mayo en la Iglesia de Santo Tomás de Aquino en la ciudad de St. Cloud, al sur de Orlando. Según información de CNN, en la misa de la mañana el sacerdote Fidel Rodríguez se negó a darle la Comunión a una mujer porque ella no se había confesado. El sacerdote bendijo a la mujer y le aconsejó “recibir el sacramento de la Penitencia (confesión) antes de recibir la sagrada Eucaristía”, explicó en un comunicado la Diócesis de Orlando. La mujer regresó para la misa del mediodía y cuando fue a recibir la Comunión, el padre Rodríguez le preguntó nuevamente si se había confesado, y ella respondió que “no era asunto suyo”. Luego, la mujer metió la mano en la bandeja de la Comunión, agarró las hostias y comenzó a romperlas. El padre Rodríguez intentó sujetar a la mujer, pero ella se negó a detenerse. Durante el forcejeo, la feligresa empujó al sacerdote. En respuesta, él le mordió la mano. Tras el incidente, la Diócesis defendió las acciones del padre Rodríguez.”Si bien la Diócesis de Orlando no tolera altercados físicos como este, de buena fe, el padre Rodríguez simplemente estaba intentando evitar un acto de profanación de la Sagrada Comunión, que, como sacerdote, está obligado a proteger”, dijeron en un comunicado. El padre Rodríguez admitió lo sucedido a la Policía y dijo que estaba actuando en defensa propia. La mujer se negó a recibir atención médica y las autoridades fotografiaron la marca de la mordedura, según los documentos judiciales citados por CNN. La policía de St. Cloud ha enviado el caso a la Oficina del Fiscal de Florida para que decida si impone cargos al sacerdote. EFE",
