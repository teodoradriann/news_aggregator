    "text": "(Reuters) - 3M spin-off Solventum forecast annual profit above analyst estimates on Thursday, betting on strong sales of its wound care and surgical sterilization products.\nMinnesota-based Solventum is one of the largest providers of sterilization devices, wound dressings, medical tape and other hospital consumables used by healthcare facilities.\nMore than half of its revenue comes from its MedSurg business, which provides wound dressings and surgical equipment. Sales in the segment were $1.17 billion during the quarter.\nThe company's performance has come under scrutiny from activist investor Nelson Peltz.\nPeltz's Trian Fund Management said in a letter to shareholders in January the company should simplify its segments to improve execution at its core medical surgery business.\nTrian, which owns around 5% of Solventum's shares and is the largest active shareholder, also said divestitures could accelerate the company's ability to reduce debt.\nContract drug manufacturer Thermo Fisher Scientific said earlier this week it will buy Solventum's purification and filtration business for about $4.1 billion.\nPeltz's hedge fund plans to push Solventum towards further business separations, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\nThe company forecast 2025 adjusted profit to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.65 per share, the midpoint of which is above analysts' average estimate of $5.49 as per data compiled by LSEG.\nThe forecast includes its purification and filtration segment, the company said.\nSolventum reported total sales for the quarter ended December 31 of $2.07 billion, a 1.9% rise from a year earlier.\nSolventum's organic sales growth was primarily driven by the MedSurg and dental solutions segments, it said.\nThe company's net income fell to $30 million, or 17 cents per share, in the quarter, from $272 million, or $1.57 per share, a year earlier.\n(Reporting by Sneha S K in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)\nShare © Reuters - 2025",

A statement issued on Friday by the state Attorney-General for Justice, Mr Lawal Pedro, said the governor also commuted 39 inmates on death row to life imprisonment. According to Pedro, Sanwo-Olu signed the release order on December 20 on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Prerogative of Mercy and in cognizance of the new year celebration. The approval for the release of the inmates was in line with the commitment of the governor to decongest correctional facilities in the state as part of the justice sector reforms. The commissioner said that the Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy in reaching its recommendations exercised due diligence in its deliberation of the applications in line with the applicable guidelines. “The Council took note of the information provided by the correctional authorities, the nature of offence, period of incarceration, age, health and behavioral conduct of the inmates,” Pedro said. The exercise was in pursuant to the provisions of Section 212 (1) (2) of the 1999 Constitution of The Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

    "title": "Facebook users concerned by lack of action on drug ads | CTV News",
    "text": "More Facebook users are speaking out, telling CTV News they're being inundated by ads for drugs while accessing the social media site.\nOn Wednesday, CTV News spoke with Calgarian Eric Priddle who said he noticed more questionable Facebook ads on his feed when he started posting updates about his sobriety journey.\nAfter sharing his story, multiple viewers reached out to CTV News to complain about the same issue, saying ads for everything from cocaine nasal sprays and MDMA moon rocks to Percocet, Xanax and ketamine were showing up on some their news feeds.\n\"The picture on the advertisement was quite literally, people snorting cocaine off of a glass table,\" said Layne Ollenberg.\n\"I clicked on it thinking 'What's this all about?' And yeah, sure enough it was for sale, like you could pick your quality of cocaine as if it was gasoline on this website, so I reported it.\"\nOllenberg says he submitted a report to Meta – Facebook's parent company – a couple of months ago, and was informed a week later that the ad \"did not violate their community standards.\"\n\"It gave me the option to appeal that decision, which I did. About a week after that, I had my Facebook account deactivated permanently for going against community standards on drugs and sale of illegal substances,\" Ollenberg said.\nMeanwhile, Joshua MacNeil says he experienced a similar occurrence.\nHe says he was frustrated to see ads for drugs so he reported them but received the same response, that they didn't violate the community standards.\n\"I was confused and angry, you know, just thinking about other people who have been in recovery like myself,\" said MacNeil.\n\"I read the comments to the most recent CTV article saying that 'Meta takes this seriously' and there's 'zero tolerance for it,' but that's not at all what my experience with Meta was when I reported it.\"\nMeta commits to removing ads\nMeta told CTV News earlier this week that the \"buying and selling of pharmaceutical and non-medicinal drugs\" is prohibited on its platform and that ads of that nature are removed when it is made aware.\n\"Our systems are designed to proactively detect and enforce against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads for violating our drug policies,\" said the statement. \"We continue to invest resources and further improve our enforcement on this kind of content to keep our platforms safe.\"\nThe company also noted it efforts to make vital resources easier to find, directing people to mental health resources when they search for certain terms and blocking negative terms associated with illicit drug sales.\nMeta to ditch fact checking Meta's chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that the company plans to ditch fact-checking on Instagram and Facebook.\nThe move is a concerning one for people like cybersecurity expert Tom Keenan, a professor in the School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape at the University of Calgary.\n\"Meta used to have human fact checkers that were mainly for political stuff, but I suspect that if a fact checker saw an ad for methamphetamine or cocaine, they would probably flag that,\" said Keenan.\n\"Now you've got an algorithm to do it, and you've also got the community. The problem is there's a lot of code words out there, so I did some research, and 'four loaves of bread' means 'four kilos of heroin.' Other words like 'Tina' are short for amphetamines, so the bad guys have all kinds of language to try to evade the fact checking whether it's an algorithm or a human being.\"\nKeenan says those code words are likely how many scammers or sellers of illicit drugs get their ads through Facebook's review system.\n\"What typically happens is that they look for customers on platforms like Facebook, then they ask them to move over to the dark web, to something that's encrypted to actually do the transaction.\"\n\"So they're not buying and selling on Facebook, but they're certainly using Facebook to advertise drugs.\"\nCTV News has reached out to Meta to follow up on why reports for harmful drug ads were allowed to stay on the website even after they were reported. We have yet to receive a response back.\n'The cracks are really large' Staff Sgt. Lon Brewster with the Calgary Police Service's drug unit say officers regularly attend drug calls in person, but online investigations add a layer of complexity.\n\"The cracks are really large for these people selling drugs online, it's not even that they're slipping (through them), they're walking right through, because I think there's never been a really massive focus on the online portion of drug investigations,\" Brewster said.\n\"We've really noticed in the last year an uptick not just on social media, but also through direct to mail. You know, even stuff that's coming through Canada Post and those sorts of things, where they're just sending this right to some people's houses, advertising some of these things.\"\nBrewster says these types of crimes are challenging for the justice system.\n\"You're dealing with multiple jurisdictions, and not just provincial boundaries, we're talking international boundaries as well.\n\"We're all trying to work together to figure out how it's going to look. At the end of the day, you have somebody who's trafficking drugs, they're trafficking an illicit substance, and it's out goal to find these people, charge them and have them go to jail.\"\nBrewster also warns that many of the ads tend to be scams to seize a user's identity or banking information.\n'Challenging' legal situation Doug King, a professor of criminology at Mount Royal University, says there isn't much that members of law enforcement in Canada can do from a criminal perspective when it comes to advertisements for illicit substances on social media that are coming from other countries.\n\"There's not much that Canada can do about this on Facebook. We can only go after the people who decide to buy them and try to bring them into the country,\" he said.\n\"It's a very limited criminal scope and authority in Canada to do something about it.\"\nKing went on to say that the recent proroguing of government announced this week could also have detrimental impacts given that the Online Harms Acts (Bill C-63), meant to address a range of harmful content online, has now been stopped in its tracks.\n\"The Government of Canada was going to pass legislation to be a more active player in monitoring social media, and that part was very controversial, right? It was one of the many things that people didn't like about the Trudeau government,\" said King.\n\"Whether or not another government will bring it back, we'll see. So, Canada was ready to take a little bit more of an aggressive role, and that got caught up in the politics of the day. So we'll just have to see what happens afterwards.\"\nProtect yourself online Kathy MacDonald, a cyber crime expert, is warning people to take precautions to protect themselves online.\nShe suggests social media users should do everything they can to prevent the cross-tracking of their information.\n\"Block cookies. Information is bought, traded and sold to third parties who will then send targeted advertising. If a person has visited or searched a website connected to a product, sure enough advertisers will connect,\" MacDonald said.\n\"For example, if you search Safari for a sporting device, suddenly that sporting device will show up on your feed on Meta. Cross-site tracking may help. Use a Virtual Private Network to help anonymize Internet searches. Monitor your Location Services and turn off as needed.\"",

    "text": "Taxat-Senat. Engagement pour la sauvegarde du patrimoine. Depuis maintenant 44 ans, les Amis du Vieux Taxat sont engagés dans la restauration de l’ancienne église Saint-André de Taxat qui tombait en ruine. Ils ont relevé le défi lancé par Marguerite Chesseret, habitante de Taxat et proche voisine de l’église dans les années 70 : « Il faut sauver l’église de Taxat », une tâche à la fois laborieuse et passionnante qui connaît un aboutissement en cette année 2024.\nUne journée portes ouvertes a été organisée samedi. Les visiteurs* ont ainsi pu découvrir une rétrospective photo commentée des différents travaux réalisés, rencontrer les artisans, écouter les commentaires sur les fresques et suivre les allocutions qui ont retracé la vie de l’église Saint-André historiquement et techniquement.\nL’association va maintenant plus particulièrement s’attacher à faire de Saint-André de Taxat un espace culturel. Des dates sont déjà arrêtées : jeudi 11 juillet, à 20 heures, concert de flûtes japonaises ; samedi 10 août, à 19 heures, concert de jazz New Orléans suivi d’un repas avec l’orchestre les Grolles ; mardi 13 août, à 20 heures, épopée musicale italienne par le Brioude Consorts et les Pommiers soufflants.",

    "text": "Yellow weather warning in place for rain and snow The alert is in place across much of Scotland on Saturday. A yellow weather warning for rain and snow has been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. The warning is in place from 8am until 3pm on Saturday and up to 25mm of rain is expected in lower levels of Scotland, according to the Met Office. A period of sleet and snow, turning to rain on Saturday, may lead to some flooding and travel disruption. Bus and train services may be affected, with journey times taking longer, with some spray and flooding on roads. Some interruption to power services is also likely. This week, Storm Gerrit caused travel disruption across the UK. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining properties will be reconnected on Friday. Travellers faced disruption across the rail network with operators urging passengers to check their journeys before setting off. Andy Page, Met Office chief forecaster, said: “Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm (1-2in), while up to 25mm (just under 1in) of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. “Across Wales and southern England, wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.”",

    "text": "- By [Aashish Vashistha](/authors/aashish-vashistha) - Published: Sat, 24 Feb 2024 07:56 AM (IST) - Source:JND In a major setback for the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka, the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill 2024, failed to pass in the state legislative council. The bill allowed the government to collect 10 per cent of the income of temples that have revenue worth more than Rs 1 crore. The bill sparked a massive controversy, with the BJP accusing the Congress of implementing ‘Anti-Hindu’ policies. The bill was passed in the state Assembly, however, failed to pass in the legislative council where the BJP has more MLCs than the Congress. There are 30 MLCs from the Congress, 35 from the BJP, eight from the JD(S), and one seat is vacant in the council. The Karnataka government passed the 'Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowment Amendment Bill 2024', mandating the state government to collect 10 per cent tax from temples with income over Rs 1 crore and 5 per cent from institutions with revenues between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore.
