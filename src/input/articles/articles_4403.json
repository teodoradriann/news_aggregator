    "text": "Aviation Unions Threaten Nationwide Protest over Continuous Deductions from Agencies IGR\n*Reconsider your planned protest, Keyamo appeals, schedules September 17 meeting with unions’ leadership\nChinedu Eze and Kasim Sumaina in Abuja\nAviation unions across the country have threatened to embark on nationwide protest, September 18, 2024, over continuous deduction of remittances from the Internally Generated Revenues (IGR) of aviation agencies.\nThe unions which had canvassed an end to the deductions stated that the protest, which will take place at all airports nationwide, is a response to the failure of the federal government to exempt these agencies from the deductions.\nThe affected agencies, including the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), and Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB).\nBut in a quick response, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, Thursday, appealed to unions in the sector to reconsider their planned protest on September 18, 2024, and allow for dialogue to take place.\nHe noted that government believes through constructive engagement, a mutually beneficial solution can be reached, ensuring the safety and sustainability of the aviation sector.\nKeyamo, in a statement made available to the presss in Abuja, said while he acknowledges the concerns raised by the unions within the aviation sector regarding the deduction of 50% of Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) at source by the government, he wants to assure all stakeholders that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR is looking into the concerns raised.\nThe miffed unions explained that these agencies are cost-recovery organizations and not profit-making entities and as such, they cannot survive on half of their incomes.\nThe unions warned that critical safety activities within these agencies are already being compromised due to the financial strain imposed by the deductions, noting that this has emasculated their operations and may degenerate further if the deductions are not halted.\nThey further cautioned that they would not be held responsible if the aviation industry becomes dysfunctional due to these financial constraints.\nThe statement read in part: “All efforts on our part have failed to impress upon the federal government that all the agencies are cost-recovery, and not profit-making, organisations.\n“As such, they cannot survive on half of their incomes under any model of administration or any other guise whatsoever. The ultimatum given to the Minister of Aviation has expired since the end of August 2024.\n“Information available to us indicates that some important safety-critical activities of the agencies are grinding to a halt under the yoke of the deductions.\n“It has therefore become incumbent upon us as trade unions and workers in aviation to inform the public and the government that we shall bear no responsibility if the industry becomes dysfunctional as a result of financial incapacity due to the deductions at source.\n“All State Councils, Women Commissions/Committees, Youth Councils, and branches of our unions nationwide are to fully mobilise for, and ensure full compliance with, the success of the peaceful protests.”\nThe joint statement which was signed by the secretaries of the unions stated that they had given the Minister of Aviation an ultimatum, which had expired, and are now warning that they will not be held responsible if the industry becomes dysfunctional as a result of financial incapacity.\nThe unions have called on all state councils, women commissions, youth councils, and branches nationwide to mobilize and ensure the success of the protest while further actions will be decided and communicated if the protest does not achieve the desired result.\nAccording to Keyamo, “We understand the strain this has placed on the sector’s ability to address critical safety and operational needs, and we take these concerns very seriously.\n“We wish to assure the unions and all stakeholders that, the Honourable Minister of Aviation and His Excellency, Mr. President, are fully aware of the situation and are working diligently to find a resolution.\n“The government is committed to ensuring that the aviation sector continues to operate efficiently and safely.”\nHe further said that in response to the concerns, the Ministry has scheduled a meeting with the leadership of the unions on September 17, 2024.\nThis meeting will provide a platform to openly discuss the issues at hand and allow His Excellency, Mr. President, sufficient time to intervene and address the unions’ concerns comprehensively.\nWe thank the unions for their patience and understanding and assure them that their voices are being heard and their concerns are being addressed.\nRelated Articles\nFAAN Relocation: Much Ado About Nothing Ayo Yusuf\nFAAN’s Bizarre N2.5bn Flights, Hotel Accommodation Cost Ayo Yusuf",

I want to be a myth buster, says European solar strategist Kahya Engler when asked about the financial burden of transitioning to solar. The cost to invest in solar energy has come down a lot. She's been working to promote the renewable technology for nearly two decades. Her most recent venture is with the Netherlands' commercial rooftop leader Sunrock, helping expand its business across Europe. To her, the case is simple. We all have daylight, and solar panels work on daylight, she says from Sunrock's Amsterdam office, where even the interior design pays homage to the sun. We're ready to go. But key to continued growth, says Engler, is consistent government policies that encourage solar — something that's faltered in Canada, and may be at risk in Europe too. Solar revolution Investment in the 70-year-old renewable technology is now greater than all other energy generation technologies combined, according to the International Energy Agency's [latest investment report (new window)](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024), published this month. While Canada lags behind in [solar (new window)](https://ember-climate.org/data/data-tools/data-explorer/) adoption, many places including Germany, China, Japan and even the United States are moving quickly. In fact, on certain days, some places are generating so much energy, the price to purchase it is dropping below zero, [prompting concerns about storage capacity (new window)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-02/bursts-of-free-power-raise-red-flags-for-green-tech-investors?embedded-checkout=true) for the abundant power source. The financial backing is putting the global commitment to [triple renewable energy capacity (new window)](https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/cop28-climate-deal-un-united-nations-analysis-1.7057835) by 2030 in reach, according to some analysts. Even if the transition is propelled by economics alone, with no further policy drivers to help, renewables could still cross a 50 per cent share of electricity generation at the end of this decade, BloombergNEF's 2024 New Energy Outlook states. Over the last decade, global solar generation has [risen twelvefold (new window)](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/06/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf.pdf), but some countries are buying in more than others. While [Germany (new window)](https://www.solarpowereurope.org/press-releases/new-report-eu-solar-reaches-record-heights-of-56-gw-in-2023-but-warns-of-clouds-on-the-horizon)has the most capacity for solar power generation in Europe, the Netherlands is the continent's current leader in solar energy per capita. The Netherlands embraces solar Solar now accounts for more than [16.6 per cent (new window)](https://ember-climate.org/topics/solar/)of electricity generation in the country, putting it well above Canada's 1.1 per cent, and the global average of 5.5 per cent. Renewable energy obviously has been a big topic since 2000 in Europe, but the Netherlands was a relatively slow starter, says Engler. It really grew very, very fast. Sunrock specializes in commercial rooftop solar, and has quickly expanded across Europe since it was founded as a small startup in 2012. The market leader now has upwards of 160 employees and more than five million square metres of operational solar photovoltaic systems (solar panels). Project manager Bart Meij says using otherwise empty rooftops offers an untapped revenue stream for building owners is an easy sell. [The property owner] can rent his roof and we can place solar on it. Win, win, says Meij. Storage on the inside, green energy on the roof. Double use, which is better than single use. Each project takes several months of preparation, and a few weeks of installation before it starts feeding energy to the grid. Solar can be built very fast compared to many other power resources, says Sara Hastings-Simon, an energy systems researcher at University of Calgary. That was of particular value when the war in Ukraine broke out, she says, and exposed Europe's reliance on Russian gas as a vulnerability. Canada lags in solar generation In Canada, where traditional energy streams haven't been threatened by conflict, solar hasn't had the same pick-up, sitting at just more than one per cent of electricity generation. Hastings-Simon also points out that much of Canada's overall electricity mix comes from hydropower, which is a low-carbon source. But when compared to investment in fossil fuels — the demand for which the International Energy Agency says [ will peak at the end of the decade (new window)](https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/iea-report-world-energy-outlook-2023-1.7005194) — investments in solar remain low. [ANALYSISAlberta gives cold shoulder to wind and solar industry, as the rest of the world is clamouring for more (new window)](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-renewables-wind-solar-ban-moratorium-1.7126195) And changing provincial policies in [Ontario (new window)](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-proud-cancel-green-energy-1.5368745) and Alberta in particular have driven away both domestic and international investment over the last decade, according to solar industry experts. It's undeniable that [renewables] have become more politicized here in Canada, in recent times, Hastings-Simon says. Alberta hosted three quarters of Canada's investment in wind and solar in 2022, according to the Government of Canada, but the province put a [six-month moratorium (new window)](https://thenarwhal.ca/alberta-moratorium-renewables/) on new renewables projects last summer, followed by new [regulations (new window)](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-renewables-wind-solar-ban-moratorium-1.7126195) when the moratorium lifted in February. Critics say the rules still stifle growth. I think it's fair to say that the policies that are being put into place are going to have an impact and slow investment into solar, says Hastings-Simon. Changing politics create instability for business Engler fears changing politics in Europe could slow the transition there as well. National elections and the European Union vote last month have [given power to more populist voices (new window)](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-63/clip/16073761) on the continent, calling the future of Europe's guiding climate policy — known as the European Green Deal — into question. There is obviously a risk that this progress … might slow down, which obviously then has consequences for us as a business, but also for climate change, said Engler. It's very important that there's a continuation of the vision. She says consistency and certainty allow for ambition. The more positive the regulations, the faster we can really make this a reality.

Il marchio fai da te prevede di ridurre la forza lavoro fino a 100 dipendenti nella sua sede, vicino a Lille, ovvero uno su sette, mentre anche il suo concorrente Leroy Merlin ha recentemente ridotto la sua forza lavoro nella sua sede centrale. funzioni.\n“Un contesto competitivo in continua evoluzione”\nQuesto sistema fa parte di un piano strategico di Castorama lanciato a marzo, che mira a ripristinare la sua redditività e aiutarla a rimanere competitiva “in un contesto competitivo in continua evoluzione”, ha aggiunto l'azienda. Dopo aver sperimentato il boom del fai-da-te durante la pandemia di Covid-19, il settore è in preda alla disillusione in Francia.\nLeggi anche: Economia. Il mercato del fai da te ha avuto un anno di successo nel 2020\nNel terzo trimestre, le vendite di Castorama sono diminuite del 4,9% su base annua, secondo gli ultimi risultati di Kingfisher pubblicati lunedì. Il gruppo britannico, proprietario anche di Brico Dépôt (le cui vendite sono diminuite del 3,3% nello stesso periodo), ha imputato questi deludenti dati “Morale debole dei consumatori e condizioni meteorologiche sfavorevoli”.\n130 partenze a Leroy Merlin\nGrande rivale di Castorama, Leroy Merlin ha inoltre proceduto negli ultimi mesi ad una risoluzione contrattuale collettiva presso la sua sede di Lezennes, nella periferia di Lille, che ha comportato l'uscita di 130 dipendenti, ha indicato la marca l'AFP Venerdì 29 novembre 2024, conferma delle informazioni di Les Echos.\nLeggi anche: In Francia il mercato del fai da te rallenta ma non si ferma\nIl fatturato di Leroy Merlin “ha registrato un calo in linea con il mercato”, ha aggiunto un portavoce, senza fornire ulteriori dettagli. “La causa principale è il calo delle transazioni immobiliari e delle nascite”, il che sminuisce il lavoro svolto dai francesi, ha spiegato.",

    "text": "La estrella de Hollywood dueña de Alpine compra un equipo en Colombia\nLuego de su exitosa incursión en Wrexham y meterse en el mundo de la Fórmula 1, ahora Ryan Reynolds desembarca en el país cafetero como inversor de La Equidad.\nFranco Colapinto sorprendió al mundo de la Fórmula 1 al confirmarse su pase a Alpine como piloto de reserva, una escudería que dentro de sus numerosos inversores cuenta con Ryan Reynolds, estrella de Hollywood que irrumpió en el mundo del fútbol con Wrexham y ahora desembarcó en el fútbol sudamericano.\nMirá también\nOtra locura por Colapinto: un fanático se tatuó su casco tras la confirmación de Alpine\nSe trata de La Equidad, que anunció a sus hinchas que ahora pertenece al grupo NX Colombia, dentro del cual dicen presente el inversor inmobiliario estadounidense Albert Tylis y el empresario Sam Porter, quien a su vez es dueño de Necaxa (México).\nEn calidad de inversores también dicen presentes Ryan Reynolds y Rob McElhenney, actores de Hollywood y dueños del Wrexham FC, entidad de la que tomaron las riendas en nivel amateur y llevaron a la tercera división del fútbol inglés. A su vez también participan del proyecto Eva Longoria (actriz), Shawn Marion (exjugador de la NBA, campeón con Dallas Mavericks en 2011 y cuatro veces All-Star) y Scott Galloway (también conocido como \"Prof G\"; podcaster y emprendedor).\nEsta es la primera incursión para Reynolds en el fútbol sudamericano y la tercera entre todos los deportes, al ser parte de uno de los grupos inversores que poseen acciones de Alpine, escudería donde Franco Colapinto iniciará la campaña 2025 de la Fórmula 1 como piloto de reserva con la ilusión de hacer con uno de los dos asientos.\nUn actor de Hollywood, un boxeador, futbolistas y más: los inversores detrás de la nueva escudería de Colapinto\nFranco Colapinto será piloto de reserva de Alpine durante la temporada 2025 de la Fórmula 1 tras haber llegado a un acuerdo para dejar Williams y así se sumó a la escudería francesa que tiene detrás un conglomerado de figuras de talla internacional en distintos deportes y otros ámbitos que son los inversores que permiten sostener a la marca en la categorías más importante del automovilismo. Entre ellos hay futbolistas, un actor de Hollywood, un boxeador y más.\nEs que la escudería, que anteriormente era conocida como Renault en la Máxima, pertenece a esta marca que tiene el mayor poder de decisión pero desde mediados de 2023 un 24 por ciento de las acciones corresponden a The Investor Group, un consorcio empresarial conformado por grupos como Otro Capital, RedBird Capital Partners y Maximum Effort Investments. Esta última justamente es liderada por dos actores: Ryan Reynolds, muy conocido por interpretar al personaje Deadpool, y Rob McElhenny.\nPero no son los únicos. otro de las figuras que han sabido aportar dinero que de manera indirecta va para Alpine son el jugador del Liverpool Trent-Alexander Arnold, fanático de los autos y quien ya supo visitar el paddock del equipo, el futbolista español Juan Mata, los jugadores de fútbol americano Patrick Mahomes y Travis Kelce, el exitoso boxeador inglés Anthony Joshua, el golfista Rory McIlroy, y el tenista alemán Alexander Zverev, entre otros.\nLos actores llegaron a poner unos 200 millones de euros y están acostumbrados a incursionar en el mundo del deporte porque son propietarios del club Wrexham de Gales, que compite en la tercera categoría del fútbol inglés. Incluso, como movida de marketing, en julio cuando se llevó a cabo el Gran Premio de Bélgica, tres días después que se estrenó “Deadpool y Wolverine”, la tercera película de la trilogía, y la escudería francesa utilizó un livery especial en su auto.\n\"La incorporación de estos atletas internacionales ganadores de campeonatos e inversores deportivos reforzará la asociación estratégica de Otro Capital con Alpine F1, combinando experiencia de primera calidad en diferentes áreas del ecosistema deportivo e impulsando el alcance de Alpine F1 a un mundo de nuevos aficionados\", fue el comunicado de Alpine cuando anunció hace un año y medio el desembarco de estas figuras. Ahora ellos tendrán bajo su ala el sueño del argentino y de todo un país.\nNo te pierdas nada",
