    "title": "Tips For Stopping From Micromanaging Your Employees | Times Square Reporter",
    "text": "views Many employees are concerned about micromanagement in workplaces, which leads them to walk off the job. Employers do not realise they are being controlled freaks, which builds a toxic work culture. Micromanagement makes employees feel like they are being monitored at every split second. They feel unnecessary stress and think they are not trusted at all. Micromanagement sets a tone of mistrust that lowers the morale and motivation of your employees. Upon finding that your workplace culture is subject to micromanagement, they will start quietly quitting and marking time until a good opportunity comes your way. In the end, your business will suffer. Many employers do not give a toss to what employees are leaving or not, but chances are you lose the best employees. Hiring is not complicated, and perhaps you may have a lot of money to spend on the recruitment process at every turn, but remember that you cannot always be lucky enough to hire the best candidate for your company. Micromanagement restricts the scope of freedom of your employees to work and keeps them on the prowl for good job opportunities. As soon as they grab them, they leave you. Micromanagement is not just good for your own growth as an employer. It hampers your ability to focus on important things, such as effective strategies used to improve sales. It rather focuses on the number of hours employees spent in the office and how much time the computer screen was idle. Ways to stop micromanaging your employees Here are the ways to stop micromanaging your employees: · Reflect on your behaviour First off, you need to ask yourself why you micromanage your employees. You need t understand where this is coming from if you actually want to control your micromanagement behaviour. · Are you a sort of a person who wants to dive into details? · Do you simply not trust your employees? · Do you have a gut feeling that they are not doing their job perfectly? You must find an excuse for why you love micromanaging. You might think that productivity will be hampered if you do not intervene. Too much is on the line, and things go wrong if you do not track every minute of your employees. Well, whatever excuse you have for micromanagement is bad and will certainly affect your business in the long run. You should focus on things that help your team to grow. As a result, your business will grow as well. Therefore, it is vital for you to stop micromanagement. · Get feedback Employers and employees often lose connection. If your company follows a strict hierarchy, there is a greater chance of a disconnection between you and your team. Managers or team leaders might manipulate you. It is not always possible that your junior staff are lagging behind. Sometimes, they are restricted to work within their scope of liberty. Despite a strict hierarchy, you should establish a connection with everyone. Nothing can get in your way to reach out to your employees. Feedback is essential from your employees. Ask them about the workplace or work culture. Is there anything they want to make changes in? You might believe that your employees hardly have any problem with your micromanagement, but they might be annoyed by your constant hovering. Feedback is paramount to understand how damaging your micromanagement is. Make sure you appoint someone to get feedback in a confidential way. Employees would not want you to know who said what. Unless you know the impact of your micromanagement on your employee’s performance, you would not be encouraged to turn over a new leaf. · Define expectations In order to deal with micromanagement, you should clearly define expectations. Everybody, including your managers in your company, should know what role they are supposed to play. Clearly communicating their roles can help keep their efforts in the right direction. Make sure your managers do not get highly involved in every task. The junior staff must be able to get things done independently. Otherwise, most of your time will be wasted tracking them. Ask your leaders to provide their teams with support as and when needed, which is what their job is. Leaders are not supposed to perform their jobs. Keep calling on the meeting periodically so you know everyone knows what they are expected of and what they have to do to meet them. · Provide training opportunities The lack of leadership skills is one of the greatest reasons for micromanagement. You do not trust your employees to do their job right. You should try to provide them with training. Even though they have experience in their field, management training can help address areas of improvement. Try to provide onboard training to managers and other employees so everybody knows what they are supposed to do. Proving onboard training is expensive, and therefore, many employers rebuff its need. Well, it will help you save a lot of money in the long run. You should try to ignore these expenses for the sake of long-term benefits. In case you do not have enough money to provide your employees with onboard training, you can take out a [business loan with instant approval](https://www.figuralloans.com/business-loans.html). These loans can help fund your small needs; however, you must have a good credit rating and a strong repaying capacity. The size of the loan will be decided based on your profile. · Encourage your team to come up with their own solutions Sometimes, employers are forced to micromanage because the team does not think outside the box. It will cause unnecessary intervention by you, and things will get out of control. You should encourage your team to think outside the box. Make sure that they come up with new solutions to help you increase sales. In fact, your hiring should be based on cognitive skills. Assign them a situation to see how they deal with it. Creativity and analytical thinking are a must to set yourself apart from your competitors. · Prioritise what matters Micromanagement creeps in when you have multiple tasks, and you want to manage all of them at once. This is not the right technique to get your business done. Try to delegate your work. Keep important and critical projects for you, and the rest should be delegated to your team. You still have a lot of work to do, but try to prioritise. It is quite impossible to handle all projects together. You should take up the project based on the priority. This will help you stay more oriented. Make sure you create a list of to-do tasks at the end of the day before clocking off. Stick to that list so you know what has to be done and when. Planning in advance will help you stay organised. The bottom line Micromanagement is bad for the growth of your business. Most of your employees will feel annoyed, disgruntled and mistrusted, and therefore, they will start quitting. You are at stake of losing your best employees. Though you can hire new people, it is not likely that every time you run into a good candidate. Identify why you mismanage and try to fix your behaviour.",

    "text": "Read full article Reuters 2024 was the first year above 1.5C of global warming, scientists say Kate Abnett and Alison Withers January 10, 2025 at 5:02 a.m. · 3 min read Link Copied 1 / 2 2024 was the first year above 1.5C of global warming, scientists say FILE PHOTO: Volunteers continue cleaning up following floods in Valencia\nBy Kate Abnett and Alison Withers\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The world just experienced the first full year in which global temperatures exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial times, scientists said on Friday.\nThe milestone was confirmed by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), which said climate change is pushing the planet's temperature to levels never before experienced by modern humans.\n\"The trajectory is just incredible,\" C3S director Carlo Buontempo told Reuters, describing how every month in 2024 was the warmest or second-warmest for that month since records began.\nADVERTISEMENT The planet's average temperature in 2024 was 1.6 degrees Celsius higher than in 1850-1900, the \"pre-industrial period\" before humans began burning CO2-emitting fossil fuels on a large scale, C3S said.\nLast year was the world's hottest since records began, and each of the past ten years was among the ten warmest on record.\nBritain's Met Office confirmed 2024's likely breach of 1.5C, while estimating a slightly lower average temperature of 1.53C for the year. U.S. scientists will also publish their 2024 climate data on Friday.\nGovernments promised under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent average temperatures exceeding 1.5C, to avoid more severe and costly climate disasters.\nThe first year above 1.5C does not breach that target, which measures the longer-term average temperature. Buontempo said rising greenhouse gas emissions meant the world was on track to soon also blow past the Paris goal - but that it was not too late for countries to rapidly cut emissions to avoid warming rising further to disastrous levels.\nADVERTISEMENT \"It's not a done deal. We have the power to change the trajectory from now on,\" Buontempo said.\nThe impacts of climate change are now visible on every continent, affecting people from the richest to the poorest countries on earth.\nWildfires raging in California this week have killed at least five people and destroyed hundreds of homes. In 2024, Bolivia and Venezuela also suffered disastrous fires, while torrential floods hit Nepal, Sudan and Spain, and heatwaves in Mexico and Saudi Arabia killed thousands.\nClimate change is worsening storms and torrential rainfall, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more water, leading to intense downpours. The amount of water vapour in the planet's atmosphere reached a record high in 2024.\nBut even as the costs of these disasters spiral, political will to invest in curbing emissions has waned in some countries.\nADVERTISEMENT U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has called climate change a hoax, despite the global scientific consensus that it is human-caused and will have severe consequences if not addressed.\nThe U.S. experienced 24 climate and weather disasters in 2024 in which the cost of damages exceeded $1 billion, including Hurricanes Milton and Helene, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nChukwumerije Okereke, a professor of global climate governance at Britain's University of Bristol, said the 1.5C milestone should serve as \"a rude awakening to key political actors to get their act together\".\n\"Despite all the warnings that scientists have given, nations... are continuing to fail to live up to their responsibilities,\" he told Reuters.\nConcentrations in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, reached a fresh high of 422 parts per million in 2024, C3S said.\nADVERTISEMENT Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at U.S. non-profit Berkeley Earth, said he expected 2025 to be among the hottest years on record, but likely not top the rankings.\n\"It's still going to be in the top three warmest years,\" he said.\nThat's because while the biggest factor warming the climate is human-caused emissions, temperatures in early 2024 got an extra boost from El Nino, a warming weather pattern which is now trending towards its cooler La Nina counterpart.\n(Reporting by Kate Abnett and Ali Withers; Editing by Nia Williams)",

    "text": "Estamos en tiempo de celebraciones religiosas y todavía aun en España son muchas las personas que de una forma religiosa o no siguen las tradiciones de estas fechas tan importantes para los católicos. Por este motivo, uno de los platos más habituales en las celebraciones y fiestas familiares que tendremos con motivo de las vacaciones de Semana Santa es el tradicional potaje de vigilia.\nEsta receta típica de la Cuaresma y del importante Viernes Santo de Semana Santa es un plato de cuchara y legumbres, que a diferencia de los más habituales en nuestra geografía, incluye bacalao en lugar de con complementos cárnicos de cerdo por lo que es apta para cumplir las tradiciones religiosas que piden que no se coma carne en esta época del año cada viernes hasta después del domingo de resurrección.\nPara toda esta liturgia y necesidades de la época, como todo potaje, se trata de un guiso que se hace partiendo de un sofrito, se remoja con un caldo y se cuecen las legumbres hasta tenerlas en su punto. Después, se añade el pescado y los elementos más tradicionales como el huevo duro y las espinacas, sirviendo todo junto de forma que los ingredientes se mezclen en cada plato.\nTodo esto deja un plato exquisito y contundente, especialmente para los días lluviosos y fríos que veréis como deleita a vuestros invitados que pedirán que el plato no solo sea de Cuaresma y sea participe de muchas comidas en otras épocas del año, especialmente en las menos cálidas. Pues es un guiso ideal para darle calor al cuerpo.\nIngredientes del potaje de vigilia para 6 personas 1 Puerro 2 Tomates 1 Cebolla 1 Pimiento verde 300 gr de bacalao 2 Huevos 300 gr de garbanzos 1 Manojo de espinacas Medio litro de caldo de pescado Modo de hacer el guiso Para empezar comenzamos cociendo los huevos en agua abundante durante 10 a 12 minutos. Pelar y reservar. Cortar las tajadas de bacalao o si queréis hacerlo con bacalao fresco, recordad que aún es temporada del bacalao skrei del norte, aunque una pieza congelada también puede valer y hacer buen uso. Para esta receta vamos a cortar tiras alargadas y finas del lomo del bacalao para repartirlas mejor. Cortar las espinacas en trozos pequeños.\nSeguimos realizando un sofrito con cebolla y pimiento verde. Y añadir un puerro picado dejando pochar durante diez minutos. Incorporar los tomates rallados y el caldo de pescado a nuestro plato para ir completando el asunto.\nPoco a poco vamos triturando el sofrito con la batidora y dejándolo fino , retornándolo a la cacerola. Cuando vuelva a hervir, agregamos las espinacas y el bacalao, dejando que todo hierva durante unos cinco minutos. Incorporamos los garbanzos cocidos y dejamos que cuezan durante un minuto. Si usáis garbanzos secos, tendréis que dejarlos en remojo una noche y cocerlos dos horas a fuego lento o 18 minutos en olla rápida. Después se usan tal como acabamos de indicar.\nApagamos el fuego, agitamos la cacerola agarrándola por las asas y recolocamos el contenido . Colocamos los huevos duros cortados en cuartos sobre el resto de ingredientes y llevamos a la mesa en la misma cacerola en la que se ha cocinado, sirviendo allí a los comensales que estarán dispuestos a degustar el plato con una buena jarra de sangría o limonada, muy típicas de la época y ligadas también a estas festividades. O bien con algún vino tinto que marida muy bien con el plato.\nPor todo esto, la receta de potaje de vigilia es una clásica y esencia de nuestro país en la época de Cuaresma y Semana Santa y es un plato que suele comerse como plato único, si acaso acompañado un primer aperitivo de buñuelos de bacalao también muy tradicionales para los más atrevidos y comilones.",
