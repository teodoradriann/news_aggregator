    "text": "LUDINGTON, Mich. (WJRT) - A Pinconning man is accused of threatening guests at a hotel on the west side of the state, leading to a partial evacuation and felony charges. The Mason County Sheriff's Office says deputies and Michigan State Police troopers responded the Comfort Inn on U.S. 10 in Ludington around 6:25 p.m. Wednesday to investigate a man who pointed a gun at two other guests. Investigators determined the suspect, 40-year-old Daniel James Bendtsen, was accused of making the threat and was armed with a gun. Police say they reviewed surveillance video from the hotel to confirm the allegations. Authorities determined where Bendtsen was staying in the hotel and evacuated that part of the facility before they established communication. After talking with police, Bendtsen surrendered around 9 p.m. and arrested. He was arraigned Thursday on two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and four weapons charges. He remained in custody Thursday at the Mason County Jail on $100,000 bond while awaiting further court proceedings.",

    "title": "Scientists link new gene to high Parkinson's disease risk",
    "text": "A team of scientists has revealed a breakthrough discovery, linking genetic variants in the gene ITSN1 to a significantly elevated risk of Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative condition that affects nearly 2 per cent of adults older than 65 years.\nThe work, led by an international team of researchers at Baylor College of Medicine, AstraZeneca and the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children’s Hospital, could pave the way for new treatments aimed at slowing or preventing Parkinson’s disease progression.\nParkinson’s disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, still has no cure.\n“To tackle this unmet need, we analysed genetic data from nearly 500,000 UK Biobank participants and discovered that individuals carrying rare ITSN1variants that impair the gene’s normal function face up to a tenfold higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease,” said author Dr Ryan S Dhindsa, assistant professor of pathology and immunology at Baylor College of Medicine.\nThese findings, published in Cell Reports, were subsequently validated across three independent cohorts comprising more than 8,000 cases and 400,000 controls.\nNotably, ITSN1 carriers trended toward earlier age of disease onset. What makes this discovery so significant is the exceptional magnitude of the effect of ITSN1 in increasing Parkinson’s risk, especially when compared with variants in other well-established, genes such as LRRK2 and GBA1.\n“We focus on rare genetic mutations because they often confer large effects on disease risk that reveal critical disease mechanisms. These genetic discoveries not only deepen our understanding of Parkinson’s biology but also unveil promising new targets for therapeutic intervention,” Dhindsa explained.\nITSN1 plays an important role in how neurons send messages to each other – a process called synaptic transmission – making it particularly relevant to Parkinson’s disease, a condition in which disruption of nerve signals leads to the typical symptoms of impaired gait and balance, tremors and rigidity.\n“We also showed in fruit flies that reducing ITSN1 levels worsens Parkinson’s-like features, including the ability to climb. We plan to extend these investigations to stem cell and mouse models,” Dhindsa said. IANS",

    "text": "Longtime NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson will take over as head coach at Delaware State, Victory Formation Media and ESPN reported Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the latest data point in a growing trend of FCS football teams hiring well-known former players -- with little to no prior coaching experience -- in an effort to stand out. Jackson, 38, has no connection to Delaware State but according to ESPN, \"it has always been a dream\" of his to coach at an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities). Earlier this month, Norfolk State hired Michael Vick to take over the Spartans' program. Vick, who also reportedly heard from Sacramento State, hails from the Norfolk, Va., area. Norfolk State is one of Delaware State's rivals in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. Colorado coach Deion Sanders spent three seasons (2020-22) as the head coach of Jackson State before moving up to the FBS level. His only prior coaching experience came at the high school level, including at his own short-lived charter school in Texas, \"Prime Prep Academy.\" Jackson last played for the Baltimore Ravens in 2022. He is best known for two stints with the Philadelphia Eagles (2008-13, 2019-20) and played for a total of six teams in a 15-year NFL career. Jackson caught 641 passes for 11,263 yards and 58 touchdowns, adding four rushing touchdowns and four punt return touchdowns in 183 career games. Delaware State went 1-11 in 2024 (0-5 MEAC) and fired coach Lee Hull after the season. The Hornets have not had a winning season since going 6-5 in 2012. --Field Level Media\nReports: Delaware State hires DeSean Jackson as head coach\nOriginally published on fieldlevelmedia.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.",
