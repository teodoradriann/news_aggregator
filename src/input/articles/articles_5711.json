    "text": "Today, the National Geographic Society announced the launch of the National Geographic Museum of Exploration, a sustainably-built, must-visit experience as part of its reimagined campus in the heart of Washington, D.C. Scheduled to open in mid-2026, the public attraction, fueled by cutting-edge technologies, will feature one-of-a-kind National Geographic curated exhibitions, immersive and educational experiences, a state-of-the-art theater, restaurant and retail store.\nThe Museum of Exploration will accelerate the Society’s mission to illuminate and protect the wonder of our world. As a global nonprofit organization, the new Museum of Exploration is a pivotal step forward in the Society’s goal to build on its legacy of convening its global community of National Geographic Explorers — scientists, conservationists, storytellers and educators — who advance knowledge, inspire action and share their remarkable stories with the public.\nAffectionately known as the “Home of the Explorer,” the Society’s historic headquarters occupies a city block in downtown Washington, D.C., and has evolved significantly over the past century. With support from JLL, HITT Contracting and Hickok Cole, the renovated public attraction will comprise over 100,000 square feet.\nImage Courtesy of: REDVERTEX\n“The Museum of Exploration marks a historic chapter in the Society’s mission to advance exploration, science, education and storytelling, bringing these experiences to life in ways that spark curiosity, create lasting memories and invite everyone to embrace their inner Explorer,” said Jill Tiefenthaler, CEO of the National Geographic Society. “We’re excited to welcome visitors to experience our mission through immersive, unforgettable moments that deepen their connection to the wonder of our world.”\nWhen visiting the Museum of Exploration, guests will enter through the 11-foot yellow border, discovering wonders of the world that the Society has illuminated for decades:\nRolex Explorers Landing: An exhibition dedicated to the innovative equipment and stories from awe-inspiring expeditions, featuring the work and artifacts of Explorers. Immersive Experience: Visitors will have the chance to step into the role of an Explorer, immersing themselves in thrilling experiences and fieldwork in exciting and remote locations worldwide. State-of-the-Art Theater: A 400-seat theater with innovations that will envelop visitors in stunning audiovisuals through National Geographic films and stories. Nighttime Courtyard Experience: Washington, D.C.’s first spectacular outdoor nighttime experience that brings the wonder of our world to life through arresting visuals that National Geographic is known for, coupled with projection mapping, interactive media and audioscapes. And much more, to be announced in the coming months!\nImage Courtesy of : REDVERTEX\n“For 136 years the National Geographic Society and its iconic yellow border have served as a global beacon for exploration, curiosity, innovation and wonder,” said Jean Case, chairman of the board of trustees of the National Geographic Society. “This new Museum of Exploration will build on that legacy, bringing all who visit the museum exciting opportunities to virtually travel to the front lines of the unknown with our Explorers, and help to inspire the next generation of changemakers.”\nEducation meets exploration at the Museum of Exploration, where learning experiences ignite curiosity and wonder in the Explorers of tomorrow. When school groups visit, they’ll cultivate their Explorer Mindset, the same attitudes and skills that drive Explorers to inquire, build knowledge, and think critically and creatively to solve the world’s most pressing problems.\nInclusivity and accessibility have been instrumental in the museum’s design and visitor experience. Braille instructional text, tactile and sensory maps, intuitive app support with visual descriptions, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretations of media, refrigerators available for guest medication storage, all-gender restrooms, and wellness rooms that can be used for nursing and low-sensory time are some of the offerings available. All exhibition spaces will feature English and Spanish text, and the experience-based spaces will have Spanish subtitles. Resources will also be available in multiple additional languages.\n“This experience is set to become a staple of the Washington, D.C. community — particularly within the Golden Triangle neighborhood — and it’s important we build upon our legacy as a historic institution in this city,” said Emily Dunham, chief campus and experiences officer at the National Geographic Society. “We are committed to making a positive impact at every level, inspiring the Explorer in all visitors and uniting the public on a common mission to become global stewards of our extraordinary planet.”\nThe Museum of Exploration will open its doors in 2026 to inspire current and future generations in the Washington, D.C. region and worldwide to learn about, care for and protect the planet. Visitors will leave knowing what it means to be an Explorer and that exploration is for everyone. They will be inspired to become explorers by engaging in, observing and documenting the world around us.

    "text": "Chernobyl soil declared ‘safe’ for farming 38 years after nuclear disaster This means that the large farmlands, which were classified as contaminated and had been left alone since the disaster in 1986, can be once again used for growing crops. Reactor number 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear plant at which the explosion occurred in 1986. Radiation levels have gone down below the levels regarded as unsafe at large farmlands near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster site, according to surveys carried out in the area. This means that the large farmlands, which were classified as contaminated and had been left alone since the disaster in 1986, can be once again used for growing crops. This can help Ukraine’s growing demand for farmland, more so at a time when the war with Russia has led to a major part of its arable land turning into combat zones. Chernobyl disaster and aftermath The [explosion](https://interestingengineering.com/science/chernobyl-a-timeline-of-the-worst-nuclear-accident-in-history) at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant 38 years ago marked a terrible tragedy in human history. The toxic clouds that spread over Soviet territory exposed approximately 8.4 million people to nuclear radiation. Over 250,000 people developed cancer, and approximately 100,000 cases ended up being fatal, according to [Greenpeace](https://archivo-es.greenpeace.org/espana/PageFiles/182800/chernobylhealthreport.pdf). Beyond the damage incurred by human beings that pervades to this day, the Chernobyl disaster wreaked havoc across the landscape by causing extensive damage to crops, plants, and infrastructure. Decades later, several surveys have been [carried out](https://southwestnuclearhub.ac.uk/radiation-mapping-chernobyl/) at the disaster site using robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and more to find out the radiation levels in the area. These surveys were aimed at finding out the radiation’s effect on the flora and fauna, and also about how much of it still continues to be present in the area. In a new [article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2435255-farmland-near-chernobyl-nuclear-reactor-is-finally-safe-to-use-again/) by New Scientist, Valery Alexandrovich Kashparov from the National University of Life and Environmental Science of Ukraine states that over 80 percent of the surveyed area around the disaster site can be used again for agricultural activities. Kashparov’s team has been surveying the area for over a decade and it came to the conclusion based on the radiation levels it found in the region. Radiation levels in farmlands around the disaster site According to the report, the biggest health threat following the disaster was posed by iodine-131 isotope. However, it just has a half-life of eight days, and has reduced to negligible levels in the following years. However, others like caesium-137 and strontium-90 which have an over three decade shelf life are still present in the area – although with levels more than halved. This is only in the areas which are far removed from the disaster site. The survey found high radiation levels in the main exclusion zone, which surrounds the nuclear reactor site. This site has turned into a forest, and it may be given the status of a nature reserve in the coming years. Earlier in 2023, Volodymr Illienko, from the National University of Life and Environmental Science, carried out a survey to measure radioactivity levels on 2600 hectares of land around Narodychi and Vyazivka. “We didn’t find a higher level than permissible,” New Scientist quoted Illienko. However, other researchers have stated that they have found high radiation levels in some areas but this wouldn’t transfer to the crops or the produce. Moreover, if farming is resumed in the area the produce will definitely be checked for radiation. There are some other problems which remain to be sorted before the land can be allotted the uncontaminated category, and that includes taking the local population into confidence. The compensations will stop flowing once this happens, and this will have a large scale impact. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES Further, the ownership of the land will also have to be decided, but these measures are more political than technical, and can be sorted out sooner than later – if the administration deems fit.

    "text": "A North Carolina General Assembly bill meant as a compromise on changing the state’s mask law would also change campaign finance law to allow more dark money donations.\nAll state Senate Democrats walked out in protest ahead of the vote on Thursday.\nThe measure passed 28-0 in the 50-member Senate. Republican Senate leader Phil Berger called out each Democratic senator’s name during the vote, but they had all left the chamber.\nDemocrats painted it as a way to benefit the Republican candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson.\n“What we’re really concerned about is out-of-state billionaires flooding money into our state, without any accountability,” Sen. Mary Wills Bode told The News & Observer later Thursday.\nThe campaign finance part of the bill eliminates some rules about reporting campaign contributions put in place by the State Board of Elections. It also eliminates the requirement that a political group’s assistant or deputy treasurer reside in North Carolina.\nBerger said the changes were made because Republican lawmakers felt they “needed to be done as a way to level the playing field in terms of money” coming to candidates from four partisan political groups, the Democratic Governors Association, Democratic Attorneys General Association, Republican Governors Association and Republican Attorneys General Association.\nIn May 2020, the State Board of Elections issued an advisory opinion to the Democratic Governors Association saying that certain federal political committees that get money from corporations can’t give money to state political-party committees, because that would go around the ban on corporations giving directly in North Carolina.\nBerger told reporters after that the law still prohibits corporate contributions and the bill “just makes it an equal situation as far as those types of organizations bringing money into North Carolina.”\nBerger described the majority-Democratic Board of Elections decision as enabling money from the Democratic governors and attorneys general groups to come directly into state parties in unlimited amounts, but preventing the same for Republicans.\nAsked if the change is to benefit the campaigns of Robinson and U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, who is running for attorney general, Berger pointed to the board’s action.\n“If you believe that the dollars raised by those outside groups are dollars that were being prevented from coming into North Carolina as a result of the ruling of the Democratic majority on the Board of Elections, then folks can draw that conclusion. I think the need was to make sure that we did not allow to continue a disadvantage that was created by a partisan Board of Elections,” Berger said.\nShortly after the Senate adjourned Thursday, Senate Democrats held a news conference outside the Legislative Building in downtown Raleigh to explain why they left.\nSenate Democratic Whip Jay Chaudhuri said the bill “allows for undue influences of millionaires now to give money to candidates without any disclosure under state law.”\nAsked about Berger saying it “evens the playing field,” Chaudhuri said he sees it differently.\n“I don’t read it that way,” he said. “So I don’t know the complexities of what he was talking about. I mean, I find the whole process suspect to be honest with you, because they just introduced this language here today without any notice to us whatsoever.”\n“They’re certainly changing the rules in the middle of an election, a gubernatorial election,” and doing so to benefit the Republican candidate, Chaudhuri said.\n“It is absolutely about Robinson,” he said. “I think the Republicans are probably running into limits as to how some of their larger donors could give money. That’s my sense. And this frees that up.”\nWalkout and protesting the process\nBerger said Senate Democrats walked out because he doesn’t “think they had any way to defend what the State Board of Elections has done. And so they decided to leave and not say anything on the floor about it. I also think that they abandoned their constituents by not registering their votes.”\nBode told The N&O on Thursday that what is ringing Democrats’ “alarm bells is the continuous theme of unaccountability.”\n“This pay-to-play politics and lack of transparency has just been a theme throughout the supermajority this biennium. And this is just a continuation of that.”\nBode said it’s also about the process.\n“We cannot have a robust, thriving democracy if the people who are supposed to understand and vote on a bill, get it within minutes of walking onto the floor.”\nAdding unrelated sections to bills happens from time to time, Western Carolina University politics professor Chris Cooper noted.\n“Nonetheless, there’s little doubt that masking and campaign finance changes aren’t exactly the same kinds of issues. This will put legislators in a quandary and calls to mind the infamous motorcycle bill from a few years ago that was amended to add provisions on women’s reproductive health,” Cooper said.\nHouse Minority Leader Robert Reives, a Chatham County Democrat, also took issue with the process and its timing related to the governor’s race.\n“This new campaign finance legislation has never been seen before, but Republicans have attached it to an unrelated conference report that cannot be amended. This eviscerates individual campaign finance limits and allows billionaires from out of state to funnel unlimited money into a committee,” Reives said in a statement.\n“They are changing the rules in the middle of an election that is already underway in an attempt to buy the governor’s mansion in North Carolina,” Reives said.\nDemocratic Sen. Michael Garrett told reporters that if lawmakers were “really trying to make campaign finance stronger and strengthen it, and increase transparency here at the General Assembly, we have a process that bills follow. It should go before a committee, we should have experts testify before committee, we should hear from the public.”\n“But this bill was dropped on us while we were in session. So if the Republicans are really interested in strengthening campaign finance laws, we all would welcome that conversation and love to be a part of it. But that’s not what this is,” Garrett said.\nMelissa Price Kromm, executive director of North Carolina For the People Action, told The N&O in a statement that there is one connection between campaign laws and masks.\n“It’s safe to say that the changes put a bigger mask on the flow of money into N.C. politics — the changes create new ways for mystery money to corrupt elections. So more hypocrisy jammed into a bill alleging to unmask threats to the public,” Kromm said.",

    "text": "Dec 29 Dec 29 We Wish You a Merry Christmas! Valerie Gus and Milo had a good Christmas, even though Gus was on the naughty list. Since it was Milo’s first Christmas, we had to introduce him to all of the family traditions.\nIt started on Christmas Eve. The boys donned their festive bandanas and we went out for pizza at Via 313. It’s the perfect spot because (1) they are open on Christmas Eve, (2) it is delicious, and (3) all four of us love their cheese sticks.\nAfter pizza, we drove around looking at Christmas lights. We found some pretty good displays (and wondered where people store all their decorations the rest of the year!) Then it was time to go to sleep until morning.\nChristmas morning, Milo got to experience something new - clothes. He was a good sport about wearing his Christmas pajamas and didn’t seem bothered by them at all. Gus was his normal helpful self and tried to melt into the floor while I put his pajamas on.\nMilo got several new toys. He loves toys and is so good about not destroying them or eating any part of the toy. After Gus and Milton, we don’t quite know how to handle this behavior.\nGus didn’t get as many treats as he would have since he ate them during his closet spree, but he still got some Kong squirt stuff and a food dispensing toy.\nBoth boys got goodie boxes from Best Bully Sticks and giant bones to eat outside. (Hopefully Gus won’t try to swallow it whole!)\nAfter opening presents, playing with new toys, and eating some treats, we enjoyed a Christmas feast. Milo could hardly contain his excitement for everything and we decided Gus doesn’t care for asparaGUS because it was the last thing he ate from his bowl!\nI’d say it was a successful first Christmas because Milo seemed worn out!\nWe will leave you with one last photo, a blooper. Milo is giving David major side-eye for making him pose by the Christmas tree.",

    "title": "Over 30,000 Boeing Workers Are Preparing to Strike - Business Insider",
    "text": "Over 30,000 Boeing workers, or about 20% of the company's employees, are preparing to strike on Friday after rejecting a new labor contract.Workers in Washington and Oregon voted against an agreement that Boeing and the labor union for machinists and aerospace workers proposed on Sunday. The vote was the first full contract vote in 16 years. It did not come out in Boeing's favor: almost 95% voted to reject the contract and 96% voted in favor of striking.\\\"The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,\\\" Boeing said in a statement Friday. \\\"We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.\\\"Under rules set by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the labor union for Boeing employees, at least two-thirds of unionized workers have to vote in favor for a strike to begin or a contract to be rejected.\\\"IAM members from across North America stand in solidarity with our members in the Pacific Northwest and California,\\\" the union said in a statement released Thursday. \\\"Our goal is to get a strong contract that meets the needs of our members.\\\"On Thursday, dozens of employees marched to a union hall near Boeing's 737 Max plant in Renton, Washington, blowing whistles, banging drums, and holding up signs calling for a strike.Photographs from outside the Renton facility showed workers picketing overnight.The strike would pause most of the American aircraft maker's production, a headache for the company grappling with safety and reputation concerns after taking several hits this year. It is also a big blow to its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who stepped into the role about six weeks ago.A day before the vote, Ortberg urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company's recovery.According to an estimate from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The last strike, in 2008, shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day, Reuters reported.The rejected contract would have increased workers' general wages by 25% over the length of the four-year contract. Boeing would also build its next commercial plane in the Seattle area, as long as the program is initiated within four years of the contract. The tentative labor contract, which included a pay increase over four years, was touted as another win for the beleaguered company.The proposal left workers unsatisfied, Jon Holden, president of the IAM's district 751 and lead negotiator on the Boeing contract, told Reuters on Monday.\\\"They're angry,\\\" Holden told Reuters. \\\"It's hard to come off of 10 years when you lost so many things that were critical.\\\"Some union members had been pushing for a much higher wage hike— up to 40% — and the return of the company's pension plan, which it discontinued a decade ago, Holden said.",

    "title": "Quand Alger passe outre les fondamentaux d’une diplomatie saine",
    "text": "Dans cette Algérie sous la gouvernance d’un président dont on n’ose pas prononcer le nom, c’est « un réel bien-être » que d’être Algérien. À l’entendre dans ses sorties médiatiques, dictées ou pas, celui qui de toute évidence occupe un rôle plutôt marginal (marionnette parmi tant de pantins), dans la structure du système militaire, n’a de cesse de débiter mensonges et illusions dupes. Aussi, est-il donc de notoriété officielle, en s’adressant au peuple, de balayer les notions de chômage, de détentions arbitraires d’opinion, de pénuries, de coupures d’eau et d’électricité, de promesses non tenues, d’inflation, de corruption de crise et de mécontentement sociale pour ne pas dire colère…, la liste ici, rassurons-nous, n’est pas des plus exhaustives, quelques autres bribes viendront chemin faisant. Le dernier discours présidentiel et le dernier de son mandat adressé au peuple algérien en est l’illustration même tant il est « superbe et criant de vérité ». C’est douloureux en même temps de voir ce que cette forme d’idéologie peut faire à tout un pays. D’aucuns, des aboyeurs et caresseurs patentés dans le sens du poil, payés pour ce faire du reste, l’apprécient et gobent aisément cet état de fait. L’image du Royaume, bien entendu invariable ennemi du duo sénile du régime d’Alger, n’échappe pas à cette morosité ambiante à l’Est de l’Eden. Ce coup-ci, c’est à cause de la lointaine Marrakech et des travaux de la réunion ministérielle de coordination sur l’initiative internationale du Roi Mohammed VI pour favoriser l’accès des pays du Sahel à l’Océan Atlantique, qu’on en a pris pour notre compte. Et vas-y que j’accuse, à la Zola, le Maroc de chercher l’isolement géopolitique de l’Algérie en la privant, dans sa stratégie sahélo-saharienne, de trois de ses éléments clés, le Mali, le Niger et le Burkina Faso. Mais la véritable raison de l’isolement ne se limite pas qu’à ces trois pays. D’autres, tels que l’Espagne, la France, la Libye, et plus récemment, le Mali, les Émirats arabes unis et l’Arabie saoudite, en savent des choses, tant et si bien du reste que cela suscite une réelle inquiétude. Cette dernière, on la trouve dans la politique singulière géostratégique d’un régime qui s’accommode volontiers de conflits en accumulant maladroitement toutes sortes d’inimitiés, à en perdre, si des fois, il les possède, les fondamentaux d’une diplomatie saine. Ceux-ci, pourtant reposent sur plusieurs principes essentiels visant à promouvoir des relations régionales et internationales constructives, stables et bénéfiques pour toutes les parties concernées. Malheureusement, le régime des deux séniles d’à côté, ne dispose pas de cette faculté de faire et s’en trouve, du coup, dans la quasi-impossibilité d’en user les vertus. Une diplomatie saine repose sur le respect mutuel entre nations, indépendamment de leurs différences culturelles, politiques, économiques ou idéologiques. Cela implique tout d’abord, le respect des souverainetés nationales et des choix internes. Ce qu’Alger n’est pas en mesure d’offrir. La communication ouverte et transparente est cruciale quand on cherche un dialogue ouvert, franc et transparent pour résoudre les divergences et promouvoir la compréhension mutuelle. L’illustration, on la voit dans la fuite en avant pour ce qui des tables rondes, pourtant résolutions du Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU. Ce n’est là, rien qu’une réaction impulsive face à des difficultés, caractérisée par le refus ou l’incapacité de faire face aux problèmes de manière directe et responsable. Maintenant, croire qu’Alger privilégiera la résolution pacifique de différends de voisinage à travers des canaux diplomatiques et d’organisations internationales, c’est un peu l’histoire d’une certaine réalité des problèmes, et une certaine incrédibilité des solutions. Surtout quand la confiance, pilier fondamental de toute relation diplomatique fait partie de ces principes essentiels aux fondamentaux d’une diplomatie saine, vient à manquer. Les pays doivent s’efforcer de construire et de maintenir la confiance en respectant les accords conclus, en honorant les engagements et en évitant les actions unilatérales susceptibles de compromettre la confiance mutuelle. La diplomatie saine encourage la coopération entre les nations. Cela peut se manifester à travers des partenariats économiques, des accords commerciaux, des collaborations scientifiques, des efforts humanitaires communs, etc. Mais à cet égard, Alger ne fait pas le poids. Inutile de répéter ici, les attitudes hostiles et haineuses des capos d’Alger telles que la fermeture du gazoduc Maghreb-Europe (GME), les restrictions de l’espace aérien, Gara Djebilat, El Arja, et des vertes et des pas des mûres… En outre, Alger a même accentué ses déclarations officielles dans une tentative de légitimer son positionnement diplomatique en qualifiant les actions du Maroc de « provocations » et de « pratiques hostiles », sans toutefois préciser clairement la nature de ces prétendues « provocations » qui, en réalité, n’ont jamais été observées. Le duo sénile d’Alger ignore en fait qu’une diplomatie saine repose sur des principes de respect, de coopération, de transparence et de résolution pacifique des conflits, visant à créer un environnement régional, voire mondial plus stable et prospère.",
