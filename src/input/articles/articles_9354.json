    "title": "SWAT team arrests 3 and seizes fentanyl, meth, guns in raid on Forsyth County thrift shop",
    "text": "By Tom Regan ,\n59 minutes ago People who live and work near the Possum Gizzards Thrift Store in Forsyth County are reacting to a raid that resulted in three arrests and the seizure of methamphetamine, fentanyl, and over a dozen firearms.\n“I think I was more scared about the guns being over there than anything. That’s a lot of guns,” Dawn Pendley said.\nShe works at a business next to the thrift store and watched as a SWAT team surrounded the shuttered shop last Wednesday. She saw deputies arrest three people including a woman.\n“It’s a little scary,” Pendley told Channel 2’s Tom Regan.\nAccording to the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office, Carl Wilford was arrested and charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, possession of Fentanyl with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm and hindering the apprehension of an escaped person.\nTRENDING STORIES:\nManhunt called off for ‘armed and dangerous’ suspect with AR-15 after chase, GSP K-9 shot Fani Willis, Fulton DA’s Office removed from President-elect Donald Trump’s case in Georgia Big Lots to start going out of business sales at all remaining locations Joshua Massie is charged with possession of methamphetamine and hindering the apprehension of an escaped person.\nBrianna McCarthy is charged with possession of methamphetamine, and ID fraud. Authorities say she was wanted in Gwinnett County after escaping from jail two years ago.\nThe manager of a gas station across Canton Highway from the thrift store told Regan she wasn’t surprised to see deputies raid the store last week.\n“This community has known for a long time that that’s a meth house. When I got here in the morning, 3 o’clock every morning, they were out there with flashlights. I think it’s great they finally got them, because they got them off the streets, got fentanyl off the streets which is killing people. But not only that, they got a fugitive,” store manager Bobbi Shepard said.\n[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter ]\n2",

    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vosoritide’s first global phase 2 study showed an average increased growth rate of 1.8 cm per year in children with hypochondroplasia, a genetic cause of short stature in children, according to researchers from Children’s National Hospital.\n“This is the first medicine that has been developed to specifically target the pathway involved in hypochondroplasia,” says\nAndrew Dauber, M.D., chief of Endocrinology at Children’s National. “These findings will help inform future studies of vosoritide for addressing growth disorders.”\nThis clinical trial funded by BioMarin is the first-of-its-kind to treat children with genetic short stature who do not have achondroplasia.\nThe team found the annualized growth velocity increased by 2.26 standard deviation (SD) and the height standard deviation score (SDS) increased by 0.36 SD during the treatment period versus the observation period. Hypochondroplasia specific height SDS increased by 0.38 SD, according to the trial published in\neClinicalMedicine.\nThe authors studied 24 children with hypochondroplasia. Half were female and 22 out of 24 had the p.Asn540Lys variant in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The mean age was 5.86 years old, and the baseline height was between -4.78 SD to -2.27 SD. The trial consisted of a 6-month observation period to establish a baseline annualized growth velocity followed by a 12-month intervention period during which vosoritide was administered daily via subcutaneous injection at a dose of 15 micrograms/kg/day.\nThe researchers found the absolute annualized growth velocity increased from a mean of 5.12 +/- 1.36 cm/year during the observation period to 6.93 +/- 0.93 cm/year during the intervention period for a mean difference of 1.81 cm/year for children with this condition. During the trial, the researchers also noted there were no treatment-related serious adverse events and no one discontinued therapy.\nThe study findings also showed standing height SDS increased by 0.37 SD during the year of treatment or 0.41 SD using hypochondroplasia specific growth charts.\nOther growth-related conditions included in this phase 2 trial were Noonan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Costello syndrome, NPR2 mutations and Aggrecan mutations. This manuscript includes only information specific to hypochondroplasia. Full data for all conditions studied in the trial will be available at a later date.\n“Patients have come from all over the world to be part of our trial,” Dr. Dauber says. “We’re excited to see how well tolerated the medication was and how some patients had excellent responses.”\nMedia contact: Beth Riggs |\nbriggs@childrensnational.org\n###\nAbout Children’s National Hospital\nChildren’s National Hospital, based in Washington, D.C., was established in 1870 to help every child grow up stronger.Today, it is the No. 5 children’s hospital in the nation and ranked in all specialties evaluated by U.S. News & World Report.

    "title": "Arsenal sure didn't look like Premier League title-winners in loss to West Ham",
    "text": "LONDON -- The debate over whether [Arsenal](/football/team?id=359) can handle a [Premier League](/football/league/_/name/ENG.1) title run-in just grew louder. After falling short last season despite holding an eight-point lead at the beginning of April, the principal challenge this time around for manager Mikel Arteta was evolving the Gunners into a more robust proposition to last the pace. There had been clear signs of progress in that regard this season, but the manner of [Thursday's 2-0 defeat](/football/match/_/gameId/671218) to [West Ham](/football/team/_/id/371/west-ham-united) will spark familiar questions about whether Arsenal can triumph in what is threatening to be a multiway fight to be champions. - Stream on ESPN+: [LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)](/espnplus/fixtures/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS) - Read on ESPN+: [Ranking the faves in all of Europe's competitions](/football/insider/story/_/id/39145448/ranking-champions-league-europa-league-conference-league-favorites) A row will continue over the opening goal given the ball may have drifted out of play as [Jarrod Bowen](/soccer/player/_/id/201089/jarrod-bowen) pulled it back for [Tomás Soucek](/soccer/player/_/id/230666/tomas-soucek) to score after 13 minutes. VAR official Craig Pawson took a long look but no camera angle could conclusively overturn the on-field decision and a goal was awarded. Regardless, Arsenal lacked the composure associated with serial title-winners. Their defending -- which led to [Gabriel Magalhaes](/soccer/player/_/id/236322/gabriel) hitting the ball against [Oleksandr Zinchenko](/soccer/player/_/id/217482/oleksandr-zinchenko) to give Bowen a chance to pounce -- was calamitous on the first goal. Their response in possession was even more troubling. Wasting chances at one end and conceding another soft goal at the other was a recipe for disaster. The pre-match talk of a summer signing coming back to haunt his former club came to pass but not in the manner anyone expected. This ended up being a night to forget for [Declan Rice](/soccer/player/_/id/238262/declan-rice) as ex-Arsenal defender [Konstantinos Mavropanos](/soccer/player/_/id/242705/konstantinos-mavropanos) scored his first Premier League goal with an excellent 55th-minute header. After excelling for his new club time and again this season, Rice endured the taunts of West Ham fans for the final 20 minutes or so here as a result of his £105 million summer move to Emirates Stadium. Rice's form has been a big factor in Arsenal's apparent evolution but, in a moment that perfectly encapsulated their regression here, he gave away a penalty in stoppage time, bringing arguably the biggest cheer of the night from the away end. Few seemed to care that [David Raya](/soccer/player/_/id/196176/david-raya) saved substitute [Saïd Benrahma](/soccer/player/_/id/194543/said-benrahma)'s spot kick as the final whistle came seconds later. Arteta has rightly praised the home atmosphere in recent times, given the transformation from the toxic disconnect that provided the soundtrack to the end of Arsene Wenger's time in charge -- but there was a tension in the air against the Hammers that did not dissipate all evening. There wasn't the maturity in Arsenal's play that we have come to expect, perhaps most obviously evidenced by their play in the final third. [Gabriel Jesus](/soccer/player/_/id/217289/gabriel-jesus) headed the ball over on 66 minutes and Martin Odegaard forced [Alphonse Areola](/soccer/player/_/id/148987/alphonse-areola) into a fine save at the end, but there was little else of note despite registering 77 touches in West Ham's box -- the most on record since 2008-09 in a single Premier League match for a team who failed to score. [Bukayo Saka](/soccer/player/_/id/280555/bukayo-saka) (who hit the post in the first half), [Emile Smith Rowe](/soccer/player/_/id/266697/emile-smith-rowe) and [Eddie Nketiah](/soccer/player/_/id/259486/eddie-nketiah) all registered shots on target in the final 12 minutes but none of them required anything other than a simple stop by Areola. Arteta, however, believed they created enough to win the game. \"When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing,\" Arteta said. \"But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30, I don't know how many touches in the box, how many situations, how many opportunities to score and we haven't done it. In football you have to do that better if you want to win. \"It's what it is. We have to try to generate. If we don't score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That's the only thing. I can't imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn't enough to win the game.\" Their failure in front of goal will also only strengthen the argument a new striker is needed in January. \"All we have is the players we have, the players I love the most,\" said Arteta. \"What we have to do is try to get better situations, more training, raise the confidence and that's it. They've done it [before].\" West Ham and manager David Moyes continue to defy expectations. After winning last season's Europa Conference League and selling Rice for a club-record fee, they now find themselves in sixth place on 33 points, the highest figure they have ever collected at this stage of a Premier League season. No wonder Moyes suggested the club is \"getting ready to talk\" about a new contract with his existing deal expiring at the end of the season. Thursday was West Ham's first win in this fixture since 2015 and, more remarkably, Moyes' first league away win at Arsenal, [Chelsea](/football/team?id=363), [Liverpool](/football/team?id=364) or [Manchester United](/football/team?id=360) in 73 attempts. \"Football is played in many ways and tonight we did the part that maybe isn't talked about as much,\" said Moyes. \"Brilliant defending. We did a good job on Arsenal tonight. They had lots of the ball, too much for my liking, but we did a great job.\" Asked about his team's aspirations for 2024, Moyes added: \"We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team.\" Arsenal, meanwhile, are in a different place. They believe they can be the top team. But this defeat showed there is more work to do.",

    "text": "Carrots, from their lush (and edible) green tops to their orange (or white, yellow, purple) roots, are not only visually appealing but also rich in essential nutrients that can benefit your overall well-being.\nAs their name suggests, carrots are abundant in plant compounds called carotenoids. These pigments not only give carrots their characteristic color but also play a crucial role in maintaining healthy eyesight. The age-old adage of eating carrots for better vision isn’t just an old wives’ tale! Carotenoids, particularly beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, are known to support eye health by protecting against age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.\nWhether you prefer to munch on them raw, roast them to caramelized perfection or bake them into cakes, carrots retain their carotenoid content through various cooking methods. Adding a touch of fat or oil to your carrot-based dishes can enhance nutrient absorption, ensuring that you reap the maximum benefits from these colorful root vegetables.\nLooking for inspiration to incorporate more carrots into your diet? Below are 9 ways to enjoy these root vegetables at any time of day — yes, even in desserts!\nCrispy Carrot Tacos (Tacos Dorados de Zanahoria)\nThese are deceptively easy and don’t need much beyond raw carrots and salt. You’ll need toothpicks to secure them closed while cooking.\nHoney Sesame Carrot Salad\nInstead of roasting the carrots, let their natural crunch and flavor shine in this raw salad.\nRecipe from Edible San Diego\nTip-to-Top Barbeque Maple Glazed Carrots with Carrot Top Salsa Verde\nAs the name suggests, this recipe uses the entire carrot — from tip to top — and can be served as a starter, main course or side dish.\nRecipe from Edible Rhody\nCarrot Cake Breakfast Cookies\nIf you love the exterior crunch, do not seal the cookies in an airtight container or they will get soft. Keep the lid ajar!\nRecipe from Edible Bozeman\nCarrot Lox\nMarinated in a savory blend of tamari, liquid smoke and nori, the thinly sliced carrots develop a rich, smoky flavor reminiscent of lox.\nRecipe from Edible Ottawa\nRoasted Carrot Ginger Soup\nYou stir in the ginger at the end of cooking, so you can adjust the amount to your spice level.\nRecipe from Edible Jersey\nCarrots with Mint Caper Tapenade\nThe roasted carrots rest on a bright green bed of fresh tapenade made with four simple ingredients: mint, capers, walnuts and olive oil. This dish can be served warm or at room temperature.\nRecipe from Edible Monterey Bay\nCarrot Mustard Cake\nDon’t knock it ’til you try it. This cake pairs well with an equally unique Mustard, Honey & Fennel Ice Cream.\nRecipe from Edible East Bay\nCarrot Salad with Spices & Pistachios\nWhen it comes to using carrots in a salad, we often think about grating them to add crunch and color. This recipe takes a completely different direction as the carrots are steamed instead and served cold.\nRecipe from Edible Boston",
