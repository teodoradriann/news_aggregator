    "text": "Over 300 People Remove Nearly A Tonne Of Manukau Harbour Rubbish In One Morning\nWhile the cost of living crisis continues to impact New Zealanders at the supermarket, the fuel pump, and the roofs over our heads, Saturday’s turnout - over 300 people who removed 8,950 litres of rubbish (880kgs) - at the Hirepool Big Clean in Onehunga shows that protecting the environment is still a key priority for Kiwis.\nSustainable Coastlines co-founder Sam Judd MNZM said \"this area has a number of big challenges with pollution, poverty and more, but it gives me hope that so many people care and want to do something about it.\" \"Across 15 years of clean-ups, both here and abroad, I’ve never seen an area worse affected by microplastics,\" says Judd.\nMore than 300 individuals showed up to take part in the event, organised by charity Sustainable Coastlines in collaboration with Hirepool - in only half a day.\n\"We know how tough it is out there for people at the moment, so to see groups of mates, families with young kids and individuals using their time, energy, and resources to protect the ocean is really heartening,\" says Judd. \"We actually had to close registrations as we had too many people sign up,\" he says.\nThe Hirepool Big Clean event was designed to raise awareness about the impact of plastic pollution on marine animals and humans, as well as giving communities a chance to make a difference to their local coastline.\nThe Manukau is a key habitat for the critically endangered Māui dolphins, which are threatened by human activity including fishing, plastic ingestion, and entanglement. Life-size models of the taonga species, supplied by the Māui and Hector’s Dolphin Defenders, helped to drive the message home. It is also a breeding ground for the keystone species of the Great White Shark - who frequent the area with giant pregnant females releasing their pups in the harbour. Shark scientist Dr Riley Elliot says that \"Every May and June - North Island harbours are pupping and nursery grounds for Great White Sharks, \"what we put into that nursery ground - directly affects these animals and their food chain.\"\nWe have seen that when silt, sediment and rubbish come into harbours that they nest in, they leave,\" says Dr Elliot, \"it’s like a tui - when you chop the tree down, they have nowhere to nest - so if you pollute these crucial habitats then we won’t have these apex predators calling our harbours home anymore.\nLitter is a known issue in Manukau Harbour, where Sustainable Coastlines’ Litter Intelligence programme has recorded higher-than-average litter density. The latest data shows 525 litter items per 1,000m² in the area - higher than Auckland’s overall average of 422 and well above the national average of 305.\nPlastic waste is especially prominent. One survey at Onehunga Wharf revealed that 92% of collected litter was plastic, with 6,416 plastic pieces per 1,000m². Further surveys are needed to build a long-term picture, but it’s clear that plastic pollution is a major issue in this area.\n\"This tells us that something needs to happen with policy and with industry, not just individual behaviour change, but first, let’s start with community,\" says Judd, \"when people understand the issues and they're empowered to take action, the flow-on effects can be amazing.\"\nHirepool CEO Brian Stephen praised the volunteers for their commitment: \"Seeing so many people come together to protect our coastline is truly inspiring. The effort and enthusiasm of everyone involved highlights the real impact we can make when we work as a community.\"",

The host began to bleed blood in copious amounts and would not stop until he went back into the church and swallowed the host. Catholic school was pretty weird at times.\nHowever, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts to trickle from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass.\nHowever, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts to trickle from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass.\nOur communicant was taught the errors of his ways, and was brought back to Christ.

    "text": "play videoplay video Video duration: 14 minutes 18 seconds 14:18 Military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi described the statement of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) - regarding the Israeli prisoners as “a very successful message in terms of timing.” Today, Saturday, Abu Ubaida, spokesman for the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, revealed the identity of 4 Israeli prisoners who were killed in raids by the Israeli occupation on the Gaza Strip. He said in a statement on his Telegram page: “After examining the identities of the rest of the dead, we confirmed that Itzik Al-Jarat, Alex Densig, Ronen Tommy Angel, and Eliyahu Margalit were killed.” According to Al-Duwairi, Al-Qassam’s statement is an “eloquent and poignant message” stating that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not concerned about the prisoners, and that their issue is not a priority for him. He believed that the timing of the statement was “very precise and very embarrassing,” especially as it comes after the Cairo ceasefire negotiations in Gaza, which ended without reaching an agreement, and one of the reasons for the failure - according to Al-Duwairi - was the issue of prisoners, as Hamas will not release the prisoners before Ceasefire in Gaza. The military and strategic expert believes that the temporary truce will not serve either the Palestinian cause or the Hamas movement. He said, “If the American approach gives me 6 weeks with trivial matters in terms of the arrival of food supplies...what then?” The first announcement by the Al-Qassam Brigades regarding the prisoners was published before the Palestinian delegation went to Cairo for negotiations, and it was revealed at that time in a video that 7 prisoners were killed as a result of the Israeli bombing. In the same context, Al-Duwairi said - in the military analytical pause on Al Jazeera - that the minimum on the list of Israeli goals is the release of their prisoners held by the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip, but they failed to achieve that goal. Field developments Regarding field developments in Gaza, especially the military operations of the occupation in Khan Yunis, south of the Strip, Al-Duwairi said that the occupation army is seeking to find a person, the head of the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip, Yahya Al-Sinwar, even though the Hamas movement and Al-Qassam do not depend on one leader, and they were martyred. Many leaders. The Israeli Broadcasting Authority said that military operations concentrated in Khan Yunis were seeking to find Al-Sinwar. Al-Duwairi pointed out that fighting between Palestinian resistance fighters and the occupation forces has continued for 3 days in the Hamad area, west of Khan Yunis. Regarding Al-Qarara, north of Khan Yunis, which is witnessing Israeli bombing, the military expert said that its situation is different, because it represents the bottleneck through which supplies pass to the occupation army. He also spoke about the occupation's focus on the central Gaza Strip area, and stressed that during the period of the attack on the camps, the occupation forces were unable to enter the Nuseirat camp, indicating that there is a tendency to reignite the area again.

    "text": "Amber Bean ’24 and the rest of Merrimack College’s [Relay For Life](https://secure.acsevents.org/site/STR?pg=entry&fr_id=106867) organizing committee are working hard this year to celebrate more birthdays of those diagnosed with cancer. “The theme of this year’s event is a birthday party,” Bean explained. “We’re going to decorate [Lawler Arena](https://merrimackathletics.com/facilities/lawler-rink/4) like a huge birthday party. We’re going to have a cupcake food truck. But what we’re really excited about is our guest speaker.” This year’s speaker was Tia Bee Stokes, who rose to popularity on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. After being diagnosed with leukemia in 2020, she used TikTok dance videos to document each of her days battling the disease. “She became a really inspirational figure to people, myself included, (through documenting) her entire journey, the ups and downs through all of it,” Bean said. “She’s in remission now and she’ll give us a survivor speech during the opening ceremonies.” Merrimack’s Relay For Life took place on Saturday, April 20, in Lawler Arena. A national fundraising effort launched by the American Cancer Society, Relay For Life participants are sponsored by friends and family to walk as many laps during the event. As of Monday, April 22, Merrimack’s event raised more than $44,000. Students and staff have been planning since this past August. Throughout the school year, they have sought donations at football games, sold T-shirts and snacks in residence halls and partnered with Chipotle in North Andover, MA, for a fundraising event. “It’s really been awesome to see our fundraising goal go from zero to now more than $27,000 raised,” Bean explained. “Also, it’s amazing to see the dedication from our committee members and directors for this cause. Everybody puts in so much work.” Bean first got involved with Relay For Life as a freshman. In the following two years, she served as advocacy director and was responsible for reaching out to cancer survivors, caregivers and current fighters to have them participate in the event. Now, she is one of Relay For Life of Merrimack’s four event leads overseeing all aspects of the event. “It’s been a lot more work than I’ve ever done in the past but I’m loving it,” Bean said. As a [human development and human services](/academics/education-and-social-policy/applied-human-development-and-community-studies/majors/human-development-and-human-services/) and [elementary education](/academics/education-and-social-policy/education/majors/education/elementary-education/) major, Bean hopes to someday work with elementary school children although it wasn’t what she initially sought out during her first year at Merrimack. “Merrimack was kind of one of the only schools I looked at that had this human development and human services major,” she recalled. “It didn’t tie me down to elementary education – I could still explore other professions that work with kids.” This fall, after graduation, she’ll be enrolled in Merrimack’s [teacher education fellowship program](https://choose.merrimack.edu/education-masters-graduate-programs/?utm_source=localiq&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=teachereducation&scid=4317192&cid=4466034&tc=Cj0KCQjwiYOxBhC5ARIsAIvdH51Xu1mp8u7AhQn8eL1A1sRRQBh32e7j1v7jd-pc8V0ZO4qZkPcqz44aAkL4EALw_wcB&rl_key=114448c98c6141d4e9a0bfa4b1a36005&kw=40059660&pub_cr_id=639051549533&dynamic_proxy=1&primary_serv=choose.merrimack.edu&device=c&network=g&targetid=kwd-1985010998767&loc_physical_ms=1018095&rl_track_landing_pages=1&rl_retarget=1) and pursuing a master’s degree in moderate disabilities. “I’ll be working at South Elementary School in Andover, MA, in fourth-grade special education,” Bean explained. “I might decide special education is my track or I might stick with the general education classroom, but I want to get that basic knowledge in special education. Even as a general classroom teacher, I’m going to have all types of students in my class.”",

    "text": "Rocío Muñoz-Ledo\n(CNN) — La nueva ley de inmigración en Texas, que otorga a las autoridades locales la facultad de arrestar a inmigrantes, “viola la Constitución de Estados Unidos”, advirtió este jueves el Departamento de Justicia en una dirigida carta al gobernador Greg Abbott. El departamento también amenaza con demandar la medida, a menos de que Abbott no la implemente.\nLa carta, obtenida por CNN, marca la escalada más reciente entre el presidente Joe Biden y Abbott sobre la gestión de la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México.\nA principios de este mes, Abbott promulgó una ley, conocida como SB4, que permite a las fuerzas locales detener a migrantes y a los jueces emitir órdenes para deportarlos de Estados Unidos.\nLa nueva ley de inmigración de Texas siembra confusión e incertidumbre a lo largo de la frontera\nLa Casa Blanca criticó la ley, al calificarla de “increíblemente extrema”. Se espera que entre en vigor en marzo.\nEl vicesecretario adjunto de Justicia, Brian Boynton, dijo en su carta a Abbott este jueves que “Estados Unidos tiene la intención de presentar una demanda para prohibir la aplicación de la SB 4 a menos que Texas acepte abstenerse de implementarla”.\nSi bien el gobierno federal está “comprometido a… asegurar la frontera”, escribió Boynton, la ley de Texas es “contraria a estos objetivos”.\n¿Cómo es la nueva ley de Texas que penaliza la entrada irregular de migrantes al estado? Las claves de la polémica ley SB4\nEl actual aumento de migrantes que registra la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México ha ejercido una inmensa presión sobre los recursos locales y federales. La amenaza legal de este jueves sigue a una demanda del Departamento de Justicia contra Texas por el uso de barreras flotantes en el río Grande. Una batalla que sigue su curso en los tribunales.\nHacer cumplir la ley de inmigración es una responsabilidad federal y los opositores a la medida de Texas argumentan que esta es inconstitucional.\nLa nueva ley ha desatado oleadas de miedo en toda la comunidad latina de Texas, que representa el 40% de la población del estado. Grupos de derechos civiles, incluida la Unión Estadounidense de Libertades Civiles, presentaron una demanda para bloquear la medida.\n¿Qué acordaron México y EE.UU. en su reunión sobre migración? Puntos clave\nLa amenaza del Departamento de Justicia de demandar se produce inmediatamente después de conversaciones de alto nivel entre altos funcionarios estadounidenses y mexicanos esta semana.\nLos funcionarios de ambos países describieron las conversaciones como productivas y se espera que los funcionarios mexicanos visiten Washington el próximo mes para continuar las discusiones.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Let the Spring Festival red envelopes return to their \"original meaning\", this year's young people have new tricks - Teller Report",
    "text": "Reading Tips During the Spring Festival this year, \"New Year's money catching up with monthly salary\" once became a hot topic on social networks. During an investigation back home, a reporter from the Workers' Daily learned that as living standards improve and some young workers enter a new stage of life, the amount of Spring Festival red envelopes given has indeed increased, but some people are also trying new styles of Spring Festival gifts. This way, the Spring Festival red envelopes can return to their “original meaning”. \"The red envelopes for my parents and other elders, plus the New Year gifts prepared in advance and the new clothes I bought for my parents, probably cost me nearly a month's salary.\" On February 25, just after the Lantern Festival, I stayed in Beijing on duty. Fan Ze, who works at the post, calculated his \"red envelope consumption\" during this year's Spring Festival and said frankly that the pressure is not small. During the Spring Festival this year, \"New Year's money catching up with monthly salary\" once became a hot topic on social networks. Some citizens left messages online saying that the New Year's money given out in recent years has been increasing from 10 yuan and 20 yuan to 500 yuan and 600 yuan. During an investigation back home, a reporter from the Workers' Daily learned that the increasing amount of Spring Festival red envelopes in recent years has indeed brought extra pressure to young people who go out to work hard. Especially in rural societies where human relationships are valued, many people have been hurt by this. Think through. In response, many places have used various methods to guide people to give New Year's money reasonably, and some young people have tried new ways of giving gifts during the Spring Festival to return the Spring Festival red envelopes to their \"original meaning.\" Red envelope pressure under multiple factors \"I didn't go back to my hometown in Henan to celebrate the New Year this year. My parents must be a little lonely at home, so I want to make up for it with red envelopes.\" Fan Ze, 28, works alone in Beijing this year. This is his first time celebrating the New Year in a foreign land. Since he couldn't go home, he chose to buy more New Year's goods for his family and send red envelopes to relatives and friends to send blessings. When I calculated it after the holiday, I didn’t expect to spend nearly 6,000 yuan, which is my monthly salary. In Fan Ze's impression, receiving red envelopes was the most anticipated moment during the Chinese New Year as a child. \"Whether it's blessings from elders to younger ones, or filial piety from younger generations to elders, sending red envelopes during the New Year is part of our traditional customs, which means blessings and good luck, so our family has always adhered to this tradition.\" Fan Ze said, as life goes by As my level improves, the amount of New Year's money also gradually increases. The amount I gave this year ranges from 200 yuan to 2,000 yuan, which is higher than the average amount when I was a child. In addition, for many young people working hard outside, different life stages have also brought about changes in red envelope spending. \"I got married in October last year. This is the first Spring Festival we have celebrated since we established our family, so this year relatives on both sides will give large red envelopes, and we also have to prepare some thoughts for the children on both sides.\" She lives in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Xinna showed reporters the thick stack of red envelopes she received during the Spring Festival this year. The reporter's investigation revealed that in some rural areas, newlyweds will receive red envelopes from relatives and friends on the first Spring Festival. After that, they will not receive red envelopes during the Spring Festival. Instead, they will prepare lucky money for the younger generations of both families. In this regard, Xinna said that this is also the custom in her hometown. These New Year red envelopes are considered to be financial support for the establishment of a small family. \"In the past few years, we have had two and three children, and the amount has doubled.\" Wenbin, from his hometown in Henan, has been working outside the home for 7 years. Although the amount of a single red envelope has not increased year by year, the birth of nephews and nieces also requires him to prepare more red envelopes. , \"Directly guarantee half of the year-end bonus.\" Spring Festival red envelopes are not only about the amount \"Should the older, unmarried, and employed people give New Year's money to the younger generation?\" \"My relatives gave my children 500 yuan during the Chinese New Year. He has two children, how much should I give to each child?\"...Many netizens posted on social platforms, saying, How much red envelopes should be given, to whom and when, \"this is also a science.\" \"Giving out red envelopes is inevitable, and those who accept them must find a way to return them. New Year's money originally carried the elders' blessings for their children, but now the amount is increasing year by year. Excessive expenditures give young people like me a headache. Not to mention some elderly people in their hometown who have no source of income.\" Wenbin told reporters about the pressure and troubles he faced. For him, the population flow and migration in rural areas have made the exchange of red envelopes during the Chinese New Year a problem. \"Most of my peers, like me, work outside all year round. We may only see each other once during the Spring Festival, but we have relatives, so we have to give.\" Wenbin also mentioned that some elders follow their children to live in the county, and some The time is not convenient to go to New Year greetings, so I have to use my mobile phone to send red envelopes. \"Do I need to receive new year's money when I first start working?\" Li Lu, who returned to her hometown in Fujian, doesn't think so. When she first started working, she even needed to advance her salary and borrow red envelopes from her wallet. \"I don't think it's necessary, but I can't stand my parents' demands. They think this is a coming-of-age ceremony after starting work. During the Chinese New Year, I have to give red envelopes to my nieces and nephews, and I was told to give them at least 300 yuan each.\" She prefers to follow the actual requirements. Decide whether to give red envelopes based on the level of interaction. \"New Year's money is a blessing and a feeling, not a comparison.\" \"In Guangdong, red envelopes are called 'profit', which is meant to express blessings and pray for peace. The amount is usually 5 yuan or 10 yuan.\" Lili, who lives in Guangzhou, Guangdong, told reporters that as a traditional custom, elders give lucky money to younger generations. The embodiment of the flavor of the year. \"We give out a lot of them, and children who meet friends, relatives, and colleagues will give one to get a lucky draw.\" Let the Spring Festival red envelope return to its \"original intention\" Faced with the pressure of receiving red envelopes during the Spring Festival, many people have begun to choose new ways and practices to express their blessings to their loved ones while avoiding comparisons in terms of amounts. \"This is a set of cultural and creative commemorative coins for the Year of the Dragon. Put them in red envelopes. Going to every house to pay New Year's greetings during the Chinese New Year will look particularly festive. The children also have a lot of fun. We also hope to use this to try something that everyone is happy to accept. This is a way to replace red envelopes.\" Xiaoqian, whose hometown is in Tianjin, purchased many small gifts with Spring Festival and Year of the Dragon elements in advance this year. In her opinion, it is a happy thing to go home and give out lucky money during the Chinese New Year. If you have money, give money, but if you don’t have money, give out your thoughts. “I hope everyone can act according to their ability and understand each other.” On e-commerce platforms, sales of many Spring Festival gifts have surged this year. Stationery gift boxes, small gold medals, and cultural and creative gifts with blessings are particularly popular. For example, a set of notebook gift boxes from the Forbidden City Cultural and Creative Industries has sold more than 40,000 units as of mid-February. Many people commented on the product that it is both beautiful and practical to give as gifts during the Spring Festival, and it also has strong traditional cultural elements. . Yang Ying, deputy director of the New Media Office of the Urban Network Department of the China Urban and Small Town Reform and Development Center, pointed out in his investigative article that New Year's money, as an important element in traditional culture, has always carried the meaning of blessing and auspiciousness. However, with the development of society and the changes of the times, the forms of lucky money are also constantly evolving. The emergence of new forms not only enriches the cultural connotation of the traditional custom of lucky money, but also embodies the beautiful vision of urban and rural residents for future life. It not only realizes the harmonious coexistence of Spring Festival culture and modern economy, but also reflects the younger generation of parents' attention to culture and the rise of innovative thinking. It is the proper meaning of the return of lucky money to its original meaning. In recent years, many places across the country have also used various methods to guide people to reasonably send lucky money. The Civilization Office of Fuyang City, Anhui Province recently stated in reply to questions reported by netizens that it will guide rural people to establish correct concepts about New Year's money; guide grassroots to incorporate the reasonable distribution of New Year's money into village rules and regulations; learn from and promote effective practices from other places, and promote rational savings. Resolutely oppose comparison and waste. Our reporter Zhou Ziyuan",

    "text": "Toda persona física que desarrolle una actividad económica en España tiene la oportunidad de reducir hasta un 130 % la cantidad que pagará en la declaración del IRPF del año siguiente, si realiza un aporte a proyectos culturales que se desarrollen en el país. Esta iniciativa del Ministerio de Cultura y Hacienda apoya al sector audiovisual, musical y artístico y a la vez libera de cargas impositivas a los trabajadores autónomos. Para ofrecer una asesoría de primera sobre este tipo de gestiones del IRPF autónomos o empresas, el grupo Proincentiva, como filial del despacho de abogados Ventas Legal, se enfoca en la creación de sinergias entre el mundo empresarial y el cultural. Especialistas en sinergia Proincentiva está conformado por un equipo multidisciplinar de abogados y economistas expertos que unen sus conocimientos con emprendedores y creativos de la cultura para generar la sinergia necesaria que, por un lado, propicie la monetización de los costes de los productores y, por otro, ofrezca oportunidades de ahorro fiscal a los autónomos y empresas. El beneficio fiscal está plasmado en el artículo 39.7 de la Ley de Impuesto sobre Sociedades, donde se establece que cualquier empresa o autónomo que apoye proyectos culturales tendrá derecho a la deducción de entre el 120 % y el 130 % de su IRPF o su Impuesto de Sociedades. Esto significa que no solo se genera ahorro fiscal, sino hasta un 30 % de rentabilidad, ya que el sector privado recupera la aportación más una plusvalía. La normativa representa una de las fórmulas de ahorro fiscal más interesantes que existen en ley tributaria española, que cuenta con el aval del Ministerio de Cultura y la Agencia Tributaria. Servicio personalizado Proincentiva buscará para cada uno de sus clientes el proyecto cultural que mejor se adapte a su realidad y que a la vez le aporte prestigio y visibilidad como contribuyente. Un ejemplo de reducción de carga fiscal para autónomos es cuando el particular debe pagar 40.000 € en IRPF por los beneficios generados y decide aportar 20.000 euros a un proyecto cultural. Gracias a este apoyo, obtendrá una deducción de 26.000 € en su próxima declaración de la renta y solo deberá pagar 14.000 € de los 40.000 € iniciales, lo que representa una rentabilidad de 6.000 € de beneficio, de manera totalmente legal y transparente. Los autónomos interesados en acceder a este beneficio deben rellenar el formulario de contacto en la página web de Proincentiva y revisar los detalles de las dos modalidades posibles para su aportación. El acompañamiento del despacho se realizará hasta el final de las transacciones, incluyendo firma en notaría. El apoyo que ofrece el despacho es totalmente gratuito, ya que la comisión será aplicada al productor cultural que recibe el dinero. Además, las deducciones fiscales impulsan el beneficio económico para los autónomos y empresas y también para los productores de espectáculos, quienes se suman a un proceso de ganar/ganar.",
