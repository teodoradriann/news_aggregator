    "title": "William French: Why America must support Ukraine",
    "text": "America’s support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion is in our critical national interest. It mirrors the challenge that our nation confronted in 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to support Great Britain with arms needed to fight Nazi Germany forces that were attacking Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France.\nThat spring, Hitler’s armies marauded west. The American public was not eager to engage in a second European war. Roosevelt did what he could to support Great Britain in its darkest hour because he understood that this was in America’s national security interest. He had the breadth of vision to see how our fate was bound to the outcome of this new conflict.\nAmerica today faces a similar situation. Ukraine — a democratic country and one aligned with the European community — has been viciously attacked by a Russian dictator who is seeking to extinguish a bordering nation that is showcasing the benefits of integration with European states enjoying free markets, freedom of expression, and democratic institutions and elections.\nPeople are also reading…\nIt took the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor to galvanize America. In response, Roosevelt declared war on Japan, and that allowed our nation to fully mobilize its strength to engage in World War II and push for victory.\nPresident Joe Biden rightly seeks to send more military aid to Ukraine for the same reason that Roosevelt in 1940 sought to aid Britain. Biden, like Roosevelt, is a serious leader. But he is being hobbled by a Republican-dominated House that takes orders from Donald Trump, who wants to slow or stop U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\nTrump’s fondness for Russian President Vladimir Putin was on shocking display at a joint news conference with Putin in July 2018 in Helsinki. Trump was asked if he believed that Russia had perpetrated hacking during the 2016 election to push votes toward Trump and away from Hillary Clinton. He responded that Putin had assured him that Russia had not done so and that Trump believed him. In doing so, Trump sided with Putin’s word over the “high confidence” assessments of our FBI, CIA and National Security Agency.\nThis is who Trump is. He accuses any agency that goes against his beliefs or personal interests as being part of some nefarious “deep state.” Trump is alone across the last half century of American presidents to bad-mouth NATO and express fawning admiration for a Russian dictator.\nWhat happened? The Republican Party was once known for its seriousness when it came to protecting national security. That was a key part of its brand. Throughout the Cold War, the Republican Party was steadfast in its concern about the Russian threat.\nAnd now? That party is holding up the funds that Biden wants committed to the support of Ukrainian forces. Republicans truck out the old excuses. “Too much. Just can’t afford it.” And: “We shouldn’t send money to foreigners when we have massive needs at home.”\nWe need to put all this in context. The U.S. is the world’s largest economy currently approaching $27 trillion in gross domestic product. The U.S. is also the world’s greatest military power. We spend roughly $1 trillion per year on national defense. This is greater than what the next 10 countries combined spend.\nIn 2022, Russia spent $87 billion on its military; its GDP stands at less than $2 trillion, placing it 11th among national economies. Mexico stands just below Russia in 12th place.\nAmerica today doesn’t suffer from insufficient military strength, in other words. We suffer from too many in our society being distracted by stories designed to pull our attention away from real issues and tangible national and global threats.\nA current big lie is that any billions given to Ukraine is somehow “foreign aid” and thus a gift to foreigners and something taken away from America.\nThe Republican Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and John McCain would immediately see the parallels between Russia’s attack on Ukraine and Adolf Hitler’s attack west on Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France. But today’s GOP is beholden to Trump, who knows little of our nation’s history and cares little beyond his self-interest and sense of grievance.\nIt is clearly in America’s national security interest — and in our interest for the world’s international stability — to support Ukraine with all of our power. In Putin, we face our generation’s Hitler.",

    "text": "Today, anything and everything either has a price or is categorized as worthless. This grander-then-grand fake binary now pervades every nook and cranny of every ecosystem on planet earth. But who decides what does and what does not have value? Is the decider even human? Or, perhaps, a Russian “bot,” or an algorithm originating on Wall Street or the City of London. Our world has become otherworldly as machines cancel all recollection of anything real, revealing only recycled hallucinations, delivering its images on a perpetual conveyor belt we call the “24-hour news cycle.” Over a century ago humans were simply left alone with our consternation, wallowing neck-deep in neo-Puritan confusion and anxiety which began the “thingification” of masses of working people, which transformed people into being objects of working power. Labor was bought and sold, creating a dehumanized existence. Stripped bare of anything human, the working poor were forced to sell themselves to survive. People are also reading… Technology has changed, but conditions for the working poor has remained inhumane. In a June 24, 2024, interview, surrealist poet Annie le Brun (1942-2024) was asked: Are we seeing a return to Puritanism? Le Brun replied: Yes, and it goes hand in hand with a deregulation that is not just financial or climatic, but general, and that is spreading with the commodification of everything. Hence the worrying disorderly return of all the forms of conformism to which people seek to cling, through reactions stereotyped by the identity they have chosen for themselves. We “Americans” are the clear winners in the contest for who is the most violent society in an increasingly violent world. There is nothing that has not been bombarded with the combination of American Empire’s arsenal of military and psychological weapons. Yes, we’re #1 in production of “bunker-buster” bombs. There is concurrently widespread misperception in our society that the Internet and digital technology seems to expand our possibilities of communication. As the Internet increasingly reaches into our inner, once-private lives, without us being remotely aware of it, we are being herded (“nudged”) into a prison of meaningless images being used to control and manipulate humanity worldwide. Global capital’s deadly grasp now extends far beyond extracting commodities, exploiting nature and enslaving man’s physical labor. Humanity is now facing new weapons designed to erase water-based and sunlight-based life and replace it with programmable matter, or “life” on a silicon chip. The Davos billionaires’ demented ideas about enslaving, domesticating and harnessing Mother Earth’s life forces into a steel-cold, lifeless global bio-computer system are counting on the blockchain and AI as an ultimate settler-colonizer singularity. The dominators, small men, want control over it all. They cannot see they’re planting the seeds of their own demise. Like Icarus flying too close to the sun, already their vulgar machinations are vaporizing, plunging into the sea. Remember the ancestors who led this struggle for centuries, for millennia. Remember the history of Indigenous genocide and enslavement. Comprehend that where “smart-city” programming and Agenda 21 originated is in the inconceivable nightmare of an imaginary world where everything can be bought. And remember that it is often at the darkest moment that reversal can begin to manifest itself. Seeds of passion and love are more powerful than anything they can throw at us. Have faith, resist, revolt, remain patient, loving and strong until the sun does its thing. Imagine and nurture the inner love which sees and feels in nature the power and ground of being, which is creatively active through nature. Never consent to being a thing. Hold nothing back. And most important of all remember: Nature bats last.",

    "title": "Weinstein’s Conviction Is Overturned: 5 Takeaways",
    "text": "In a 4-to-3 decision on Thursday, New York’s highest court overturned Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 conviction on felony sex crime charges , a reversal that horrified and dismayed many of the women whose decision to speak out against Mr. Weinstein, a prominent Hollywood producer, accelerated the #MeToo movement.\nThe New York Court of Appeals agreed with Mr. Weinstein’s defense team that the trial judge who presided over the sex crimes case in Manhattan, Justice James Burke, made a critical error when he let prosecutors call as witnesses several women who testified that Mr. Weinstein had assaulted them, even though none of those allegations had led to charges.\nThe women became known as Molineux witnesses, a term that refers to trial witnesses who are allowed to testify about criminal acts that the defendant has not been charged with committing. In writing for the majority, Judge Jenny Rivera said permitting such testimony in Mr. Weinstein’s case had served to wrongly “diminish defendant’s character before the jury.”\nThe ruling, four years after Mr. Weinstein was convicted of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant and of raping an actress, did not surprise many legal analysts who had questioned whether prosecutors had taken too big a risk in their efforts to win over the jury.\nIn its decision, the court came to the conclusion that prosecutors had done just that and, along with Justice Burke, had violated a central tenet of criminal trials: Defendants should be judged only on the charges against them.\nHere are five takeaways from the court’s ruling:\nThe court cited “egregious errors.” The court said the trial’s fairness had been compromised by two key prosecution strategies: the use of Molineux witnesses and the prosecutors’ disclosure that if Mr. Weinstein took the stand in his own defense, they would ask him about dozens of allegations of other crimes and boorish, frightening behavior.\nBefore the trial, during what is known as a Sandoval hearing, Justice Burke said he would let prosecutors question Mr. Weinstein about 28 allegations that included physically attacking his brother, threatening to cut off a colleague’s genitals with gardening shears, throwing a table of food, and screaming and cursing at hotel restaurant staff after they told him the kitchen was closed.\nThat threat made it impossible for Mr. Weinstein to take the stand even though he was “begging” to testify in his own defense, his lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said during oral arguments before the Court of Appeals in February.\nIn its majority opinion, the court agreed.\n“The threat of a cross-examination highlighting these untested allegations undermined defendant’s right to testify,” Judge Rivera wrote. “The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial.”\nThe three dissenting judges slammed the majority. Three judges — Madeline Singas, Anthony Cannataro and Michael J. Garcia — dissented in a pair of scathing opinions that accused the majority of continuing “a disturbing trend of overturning juries’ guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.”\nThe judges said the court had ignored evidence that the Molineux witnesses had established: that Mr. Weinstein had displayed a pattern of coercion and manipulation.\nJudge Singas said the ruling would make it harder to use such witnesses in future sexual assault cases.\n“Men who serially sexually exploit their power over women — especially the most vulnerable groups in society — will reap the benefit of today’s decision,” she wrote.\nJudge Cannataro said the additional witnesses the prosecution had presented had helped upend the still-pervasive notion that a sexual assault must involve “the stereotypical stranger in a dark alley who isolates his victim or waits for her to be alone before launching a violent assault.”\nThe case clearly caused tension among the court, evident in a series of back-and-forth statements between the judges, with the majority defending itself against the dissenters’ claims that the ruling weakened the ability of accusers to push their cases through the criminal court system.\n“We do not ‘shut eyes to the enduring effect of rape culture on notions of consent, and intent,’” Judge Rivera wrote, referring to part of Judge Singas’s dissent. “On the contrary, consistent with our judicial role, our analysis is grounded on bedrock principles of evidence and the defendant’s constitutional right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial.”\nVictims and activists are devastated but remain determined. Dawn Dunning, one of the Molineux witnesses who testified against Mr. Weinstein, said she was asked after the ruling if she regretted testifying.\n“My answer is a resounding ‘no,’” she said in a statement. “I am a stronger person for having done so, and I know that other women found strength and courage because I and other Weinstein survivors confronted him publicly. The culture has changed, and I am confident that there is no going back.”\nShe and others encouraged Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, to retry the case. The 2020 case was tried under Cyrus R. Vance Jr., Mr. Bragg’s predecessor. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Bragg said that he would retry the case.\nAshley Judd , the first actress to come forward with allegations against Mr. Weinstein, called the news “unfair to survivors.”\n“We still live in our truth,” she said. “And we know what happened.”\nMs. Judd appeared with several other sexual assault survivors and activists on Thursday at a hastily arranged news conference on the 29th floor of the Millennium Hilton in Midtown.\nTarana Burke, the founder of #MeToo, said one of the overarching goals of the movement — to get the court system to take sexual assault cases more seriously — is “long, strategic and thoughtful.”\n“The bad thing about survivors is there are so many of us,” she said. “But the good thing about survivors is that there are so many of us.”\nMr. Weinstein’s conviction in California still stands. Mr. Weinstein, who had been serving a 23-year sentence at Mohawk Correctional Facility in upstate New York, learned about the decision after someone at the prison showed him a news report about the ruling, according to his lawyer, Mr. Aidala.\nHe talked to Mr. Aidala just after 10 a.m., about an hour after the ruling came down.\nMr. Aidala said Mr. Weinstein “wasn’t emotional, like crying,” but he was “very gracious, very grateful.”\nEven with the conviction overturned, Mr. Weinstein is not a free man. He is still facing a 16-year sentence in California, where a jury convicted him in 2022 of raping a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel . He was to serve that term after his New York sentence. Now, he could be transferred to California, but he will most likely be transferred from state prison to Rikers Island, the jail complex in New York City, as he waits for Mr. Bragg to decide whether to push for another trial.\n… But he will soon appeal it. After Thursday’s decision came down, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer in California, Jennifer Bonjean, said she expected the ruling to help him when he appeals his California conviction on May 20.\nA jury in Los Angeles Superior Court deadlocked on charges of sexual battery by restraint, forcible oral copulation and forcible rape in December 2022. Those charges were related to accusations brought by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker and the wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, and Lauren Young, a model and screenwriter.\nBut the jury found Mr. Weinstein guilty on three other counts — rape, forcible oral sex and sexual penetration — involving an Italian actress who testified that he attacked her in a hotel room in 2013. The jury acquitted Mr. Weinstein of one count of sexual battery involving a massage therapist.\nIn that case, as in New York, prosecutors were allowed to use witnesses who accused Mr. Weinstein of sex crimes that he had not been charged with. However, the laws around such witnesses are different in California.\nJurors in the California trial were “overwhelmed with this bad character evidence that was not legitimate, that tainted the whole trial in California from our perspective,” Ms. Bonjean said.\nThe post Weinstein’s Conviction Is Overturned: 5 Takeaways appeared first on New York Times .",
