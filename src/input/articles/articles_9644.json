    "title": "Opera 109.0",
    "text": "It may not enjoy the same level of attention as other heavyweight web browsers, but there’s still a lot to like about Opera. Rebooted in June 2013 as a Chromium-based variant, the new Opera’s early history was a troubled one, with many long-established features absent. Even now, some aren’t coming back – specifically Opera’s old built-in mail client, which is available on its own as\n[Opera Mail](/article/30349-opera_mail).\nThe reboot was prompted by Opera’s decision to abandon its own proprietary web rendering engine (Presto) in favour of Google’s open-source Chromium engine. This left Opera room to focus more on the user interface, and while it’s taken a while to get all the key functionality back, Opera is now starting to fire on all cylinders, particularly now bookmark support has been restored after various failed attempts to move to a different way of storing favourites.\nThe redesigned Start page gives you a choice of three views: Speed Dial lets you place key favourites front and centre via a series of tiles, which includes the ability to group related sites together. The Discover tab can be customised to show you news and updates from a variety of topics focused on your chosen location.\nAnd finally, the restored bookmarks can be displayed as a list or as a grid containing thumbnail preview images (or site icon). What was stored in the now-defunct Stash can be found here. It’s very flashy, but the key thing is it’s logical, and it works.\nOther handy features include Opera Turbo – technology also found on its mobile browser that compresses data while you browse to speed up website loading. It’s designed primarily for slower networks but will work on any network you choose. Also look out for Tab Previews (simply roll your mouse over any tab for a pop-up preview of its contents, which are dynamically updated along with the page itself).\nOpera is still a work in progress, but it’s come a long way in the 15 months since we reviewed the first release of this new reboot. It’s now starting to feel like a genuine alternative to the better-known browsers out there.\nVerdict:\nIt's taken a while, but Opera's rebooted web browser is finally starting to come of age, particularly now it's restored key features like bookmarks. Well worth trying alongside your regular browser.",

    "title": "Booming recycling market benefits environment - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "From pre-loved clothing and handbags to furniture and books, the trade in secondhand merchandise is growing rapidly in China — delivering not only bargains, but also green benefits. The trend represents a change in Chinese people's mindset, as more consumers are recognizing the value of extending the life span of products through reuse and recycling. By embracing the secondhand market, they are not only finding cost-effective alternatives but also contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly way of life through the recycling of goods. Kang Lin, in her 40s, is originally from Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and now calls Hong Kong home. A seasoned traveler, she lived in Oxford, the United Kingdom, for a year and a half, Shanghai for a year, and Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, for 12 months. For Kang, buying secondhand goods is more than just a cost-saving measure — it's a lifestyle choice that celebrates sustainability and uncovers hidden treasures from the past. \"When I lived overseas, buying secondhand was the most cost-effective option since these items were inexpensive, and I didn't mind discarding them when I left,\" she said. \"It's also environmentally friendly, as it prevents usable items from going to waste — my unwanted items may be desired by others, and vice versa.\"",

    "title": "Inside the Vatican choir's historic performance at Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi",
    "text": "When Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al Azhar signed the historic Document of Human Fraternity in Abu Dhabi in 2019, the seeds of a ground-breaking performance were sown.\nAccompanying the two religious leaders was Monsignor Marcos Pavan, the choirmaster of the Sistine Chapel Choir which, for more than 1,500 years, has assisted the Pope in official duties and liturgical services. As plans for the Abrahamic Family House were being finalised, the Brazilian priest wondered then if his celebrated ensemble would eventually make its Middle Eastern debut.\n“During that visit we saw the plans for the Abrahamic Family House and I remember all of us were moved,” he tells The National .\n“What stayed with me after my return to Rome was the spirit of this place and we started working on a way for the choir to return to Abu Dhabi if the opportunity arrived.”\nWith Abrahamic Family House officially opened last year, Monsignor Pavan and the choir made their way to the multi-faith complex for a stirring performance organised by Abu Dhabi Festival on Thursday.\nPositioned in-front of the altar at St Francis Church and dressed in official black suits and red tie, the choir’s hour-long programme featured works spanning 500 years, with pieces from 16th century Italian composer Giovanni Da Palestrina to cardinal and composer Domenico Bartolucci, who was also a former musical director of the choir and died in 2013.\nSheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak, the Minister of Tolerance and Coexistence, also attended Thursday's performance.\nThe Sistine Chapel Choir performing Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi. Chris Whiteoak / The National Monsignor Pavan says the choir's rich history, dating back to its establishment by Pope Sixtus IV in 1475, shows the important role music has always played in Catholicism.\nIn addition to its primary role of providing music for liturgical services of the Pope at the Vatican – including major events during Christmas, Easter and papal conclaves – the choir is also dedicated to preserving the musical forms of Gregorian chants and Renaissance polyphony, a genre of choral music which flourished from the 14th to the 16th century.\n“Music in itself is spiritual because it is a language that transcends words and speaks directly to the heart,” Monsignor Pavan says. “When you are sad there is always music to sing and when you are happy aren't we often humming? For each condition of the human heart there is a soundtrack and what the choir does, particularly when it comes to liturgical services, is to assist in creating that sacred atmosphere.”\nThe Sistine Chapel Choir comprises 20 men in the role of tenors and basses, and 30 boys who function as sopranos and altos. While the adults are often professional singers, the boys receive free musical and academic education at the Schola Puerorum, the choir's inhouse school in Rome.\nWith no official accommodation provided, students are often based in Rome and its surroundings.\nWith young members often leaving the choir as their voices change at the onset of puberty, Monsignor Pavan, who led the choir for over two decades, says annual auditions are held each year at local parishes and schools in Rome.\nDating back to the 15th century, the Sistine Chapel Choir is one of the oldest functioning music groups in the world. Chris Whiteoak / The National So what does he look for during these listening sessions? “You have to understand that many of them audition when they are as young as eight,” he says.\n“So when they sing, one can quickly understand that they have a good voice that we can work with to make it better. But what we are looking for also is whether they have this natural inclination to sing. If I can hear that, I can really begin to understand the situation.”\nAs for those leaving the choir at the onset of maturity, Monsignor Pavan says the conversation is gentle without sugar-coating the truth.\n“They are sad but that is the natural order of things. There is still plenty of life to live,” he says. “Many of them go on to continue their music careers as singers, pianists or organists, and some even come back to the choir years later as adults.”\nREAD MORE How the Abrahamic Family House inspired an epic symphony of peace, love and tolerance That said, it’s not only the students who depart with life lessons. Monsignor Pavan, who also performs pastoral duties with the students, says they inspire him every day.\n“The sacrifices they make to be part of this choir is extraordinary. Some of them live far away from Rome and must leave the house very early to come to the school,” he says.\n“They do this because they love to sing and be part of something beautiful. That’s motivation. That’s inspiration.”\nUpdated: May 31, 2024, 2:29 PM",

    "text": "Longview pastor leads Martin Luther King Jr. Day March despite snowy weather LONGVIEW, Texas (KLTV) - For more than a decade, Pastor Damien Reese has marched on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and he plans to keep the tradition this Monday, despite the winter weather. “There’s a feeling that comes over you when you march,” said Pastor and Event Coordinator Damien Reese. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, he wears a black suit, black tie and white shirt, just like Dr. King did. “I respect his leadership, and I want to emulate his movements, some of his words,” said Reese. He is part of the group that has organized this event for the past 30 years in Longview. “I’m honored to be part of this history because each year I learn something more,” said Reese. The [Longview Area Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance ](https://www.facebook.com/events/1119180259089585?ref=newsfeed)had initially decided to cancel the march due to inclement weather, but after feedback from its members and community, they decided to relaunch it. “It will take something extremely drastic to cancel the march, as long as we are psychically able. God gives us strength and agility to march. I believe we owe it to Dr. King,” said Reese. Those who participate in the march will be given the option to walk or follow behind with a vehicle. This year’s theme is a famous quote. “We want to focus a little bit on leadership, so that those who follow can get in line behind those who lead,” said Reese. Reese will march once again this year, despite the weather, because for him this is a way to honor Martin Luther King Jr. “Each year the importance grows, the importance to march, the importance to be a part,” said Reese. The march is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Monday. For those participating, you can choose to march or drive your car from Broughton Park to Mt. Olive Baptist Church. An interfaith service will take place immediately after inside the church. Copyright 2024 KLTV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Haley rectifica luego de las críticas por no mencionar la esclavitud como causa de la Guerra Civil\nLa candidata presidencial republicana acusó sin pruebas al votante que le preguntó sobre la causa de la Guerra Civil de ser una “planta demócrata”\nLa candidata presidencial republicana, Nikki Haley, intentó aclarar este jueves unos comentarios polémicos que han generado una ola de críticas en su contra en los que no mencionó la esclavitud como la causa de la Guerra Civil.\n“Por supuesto, la Guerra Civil tuvo que ver con la esclavitud”, dijo Haley en una entrevista radiofónica de New Hampshire, según\n recogió The Hill. “Lo sabemos. Esa es la parte fácil. Lo que estaba diciendo es ¿qué significa para nosotros hoy? Lo que significa para nosotros hoy tiene que ver con la libertad. De eso se trataba”.\nMás tarde, según\ninformó el New Hampshire Journal, la candidata republicana acusó sin pruebas al votante que le preguntó sobre la causa de la Guerra Civil de ser una “planta demócrata”.\n“Biden y los demócratas siguen enviando plantas demócratas para que hagan cosas como esta para que los medios reaccionen”, dijo la republicana. “Sabemos cuando están allí, sabemos lo que están haciendo. ¿Por qué Biden hace eso? ¿Por qué no se lo hace a ningún otro candidato? Es porque sabe que lo derroto por dos dígitos”.\nY añadió: “También es porque saben que quieren competir contra Trump. Están tratando de ayudar a Trump, han intentado ayudar a Trump todo este tiempo”.\nPor esa misma razón, argumentó, el votante no se identificó ante los periodistas.\n“Esto es lo que hacen, y estoy tratando de devolverles las preguntas. En este caso, esto es lo que pasó, pero sí, esto es lo que están haciendo. Y si notas que no mencionó nada sobre la esclavitud, no habló de eso, porque esa no era la intención. Esa nunca fue su intención”, aseguró Haley.\n¿Cuál fue la polémica?\nLa exgobernadora de Carolina del Sur y embajadora de las Naciones Unidas, fue criticada el miércoles por la noche después de que un votante le preguntara directamente a Haley: “¿Cuál fue la causa de la Guerra Civil?”, a lo que ella dio una respuesta larga, ignorando mencionar la esclavitud, que fue el motivo de la Guerra.\n“Creo que la causa de la Guerra Civil fue básicamente cómo iba a funcionar el gobierno: las libertades y lo que la gente podía y no podía hacer”, dijo Haley al comienzo de su respuesta.\n“Necesitamos tener capitalismo. Necesitamos tener libertad económica. Necesitamos asegurarnos de hacer todo lo posible para que las personas tengan libertad de expresión, libertad de religión, libertad de hacer o ser lo que quieran sin que el gobierno se interponga en su camino”, continuó en su larga respuesta.\nDespués de que el votante respondió diciendo que le parecía “sorprendente” que Haley no hubiera usado la palabra “esclavitud” en ningún momento de su respuesta, la candidata le repreguntó: “¿Qué quieres que diga sobre la esclavitud?”.\nCríticas bipartidistas\nLuego del intercambio de Haley con el votante, varios líderes, tanto demócratas como republicanos, salieron a criticar a la exembajadora.\nEl presidente Joe Biden respondió con una publicación en X, diciendo: “Se trataba de esclavitud”.\nMientras que el presidente del Comité Nacional Demócrata, Jaime Harrison, dijo en un comunicado: “Esto no es difícil: condenar la esclavitud es la base para cualquiera que quiera ser presidente de Estados Unidos”.\nPor el lado republicano, el PAC que respalda al expresidente Donald Trump comentó que Haley “claramente no está lista para el horario estelar”.\n“Nikki Haley está luchando. Haley no pudo decir que la Guerra Civil fue sobre esclavitud y cree que Dubuque está en New Hampshire”, escribió el MAGA PAC en un comunicado. “De hecho, Haley ahora afirma que la cuestión de la Guerra Civil era una ‘planta’. El problema es su respuesta, no la pregunta. Haley claramente no está lista para el horario estelar”.\nEn la misma línea, el también rival de Haley en las primarias republicanas, Ron DeSantis, dijo a los periodistas en Iowa que la explicación de Haley sobre la Guerra Civil era una “ensalada de palabras incomprensibles” y la llamó “una candidata no lista para el horario de máxima audiencia”.\nCon información de\nNBC News.\nSigue leyendo:",
