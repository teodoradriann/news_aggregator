El medallista de bronce centroamericano, en 2023, aprovechó sus virtudes en la media y larga distancia, según informa el sitio Jit.\nEntre tanto, en la división de 92 kg, Nelson Williams no tuvo dificultades para vencer al anfitrión Lin Feng Xie. El agramontino se exigió a fondo desde el inicio, evitando dejar margen a dudas, teniendo en cuenta la condición de local de su rival.\nPreviamente, Saidel Horta (57 kg) fue verdugo, por 4-1, del kazajo Assylzhan Serikbay. «He podido sacar a relucir la experiencia acumulada a lo largo de mi carrera, y ganar asalto por asalto con lo justo, sin desgastarme», dijo.\nHoy se efectuará el cartel final. En aras de concretar tres medallas de oro, los antillanos cruzarán guantes ante tres locales. Horta lo hará con Ping Lv, Cuéllar será rival de Shi Han Hu, y Williams de Han Xuezhen.\nHasta el momento Cuba contabiliza una medalla de plata y cinco bronces, según reportó la Agencia Cubana de Noticias, saldo que podría mejorar de ganar los cubanos en sus presentaciones.",

    "text": "A rally outside NSW Labor headquarters on July 10, organised by Stop the War in Palestine – Sydney, expressed support for Western Australian Senator Fatima Payman. It was addressed by trade union and student activists, as well as Lachlan Good, who resigned from Labor over its poor treatment of Payman, including its refusal to implement policy to recognise the state of Palestine. “I resigned from the ALP last week, after being a member for many years and an office bearer, in reaction to the resignation of Senator Payman and the disgusting treatment she has faced from the parliamentary caucus,” Good said. “Recognition of the Palestinian state is ALP policy … as determined by the national conference, by its delegates elected by affiliated unions and rank and file members.” For Labor MPs to refuse to implement that binding policy and to pressure Payman to resign was “disgusting”, Good said, adding that it “betrays its basic values, its democratically elected delegates and its members”. Teacher unionist and member of the Teachers and School Staff for Palestine (NSW) Olivia Serougi, urged other members of Labor to follow Payman’s lead and “break ranks with the Labor leadership”. “The Labor government should recognise the state of Palestine. They should expel the Israeli ambassador,” she said. “Our government should impose immediate sanctions on Israel. “Every time Israel massacres civilians, every time Israel burns children alive, [Palestinians] look around the world to countries like Australia for consequences. Yet none come and so the horror just continues.”",

Familias reciben apoyos La gobernadora junto a la presidenta del Sistema DIF Quintana Roo atendieron personalmente y de forma directa a familias que perdieron sus patrimonios. La gobernadora Mara Lezama Espinosa llevó a la comunidad La Ceiba y a las colonias de Bacalar todos los apoyos para superar la emergencia ocasionada por las inundaciones, como son los paquetes alimentarios, enseres domésticos, servicios médicos y las acciones de nebulización, termonebulización y control larvario para prevenir enfermedades. En La Ceiba, la gobernadora de Quintana Roo continuó atendiendo y resolviendo en territorio, 24/7, las necesidades de las familias afectadas por las inundaciones ocasionadas por las lluvias atípicas que cayeron sobre la región, como lo ha hecho desde el día 1 de la emergencia. “Seguimos en recorridos, en la comunidad La Ceiba, en Bacalar, con todos los equipos de emergencia de los tres órdenes de gobierno, para atender a las familias afectadas por las inundaciones. Continuamos entregando paquetes alimentarios y seguiremos distribuyendo la ayuda a quienes más lo necesiten para no dejar a nadie atrás” expresó la Gobernadora. La fortaleza de estas acciones está, en gran medida, en el trabajo que realiza el Sistema DIF Quintana Roo, encabezado por la presidenta honoraria Verónica Lezama Espinosa, pues desde el día 1 hasta esta mañana, ha contribuido 24/7 en territorio y de manera directa en la preparación de 1 mil 842 alimentos calientes y realizado 1 244 censos; además de la entrega de 1 mil 519 despensas. Acompañada de autoridades del Ejército, Marina, Guardia Nacional, así como de funcionarios y brigadistas del gobierno del estado y municipal, la gobernadora del estado entregó en Bacalar apoyos como refrigeradores, camas, despensas, de forma directa y transparente, así como con amplio sentido humanista y solidario.",

    "text": "Destiny Church says biker vests are ‘korowai, not gang patches’ Destiny Church says biker vests are ‘korowai, not gang patches’ Public Interest Journalism funded through NZ On Air Destiny Church bikers will continue to wear their Tu Tangata leather vests because “they are korowai, not gang patches”, says church matriarch Hannah Tamaki. New legislation on Monday outlawed the wearing of gang patches in public, and offenders who break that ban could be fined up to $5000 or jailed for six months. The gang patch ban extends to funerals and tangi. Tamaki told the Herald the 90 bikers who ride under Destiny Church’s Tu Tangata Iwi Tapu patch would continue in the church colours. Half of the 90 Destiny bikers were former gang members who traded their Black Power and Mongrel Mob patches for the religious insignia. “We don’t consider Tu Tangata Iwi Tapu a patch or a gang. It’s a korowai,” Tamaki said. The Tu Tangata, Iwi Tapu bikers on a bike run. A korowai is a traditional woven Māori cloak and is worn as a mantle of prestige and honour. “It’s only worn for special events and as a group, it is not for everyday wear. “There are bike clubs also who only wear their vests on organised rides and tangi. - [Heather du Plessis-Allan: What will happen with the new gang patch ban?](/on-air/heather-du-plessis-allan-drive/opinion/heather-du-plessis-allan-what-will-happen-with-the-new-gang-patch-ban/?utm_source=zb&utm_campaign=article_link&utm_content=related) - [Crackdown: $5k fine for wearing gang patch in public under new law](/news/politics/gang-crackdown-government-to-introduce-legislation-to-ban-gang-insignia-in-public-places-and-gathering-in-groups/?utm_source=zb&utm_campaign=article_link&utm_content=related) - [Chris Cahill: Law should allow officers to take gang patches off people](/on-air/mike-hosking-breakfast/audio/chris-cahill-law-should-allow-officers-to-take-gang-patches-off-people/?utm_source=zb&utm_campaign=article_link&utm_content=related) “This Government has shown its true colours with the scrapping of the Māori Health Authority and its anti-Māori agenda with the gang patches. “But we will stand up to it.” The Tu Tangata Riders. Brian Tamaki also fired a warning shot to Police Minister Mark Mitchell. “There is a fine line as well between criminal gangs and law-abiding citizens,” Tamaki said. “All sorts of clubs and groups have uniformed insignia and to be pulled up by police and told to remove tops, jackets, tees will contravene our rights. “A few can’t ruin it for the many and I think Police Minister Mark Mitchell needs to be clear that Tu Tangata Iwi Tapu Riders is accomplishing huge work in turning the lives of these gangsters around. “In fact, National’s worry about gang membership rising should be encouraging them to wear the Tu Tangata Korowai - it’s reforming gangsters quicker than government agencies.” But he also agreed with the gang patch ban. “I agree the gang patches have to go. They instill fear and recklessness,” Tamaki said. The Destiny bikers were in Hawke’s Bay last week for a memorial ride to mark one year since Cyclone Gabrielle. Tamaki said the group were warmly welcomed by locals. “Our last weekend ride was a memorial ride for the Bay, a year on from Cyclone Gabriel. It was a great time to catch up and hear how the people in the flood-hit places are doing. “A year on, there is still a lot of mahi to be done. “Many whānau are still working through some challenges.” Hawke’s Bay community advocate and lifetime Black Power member Denis O’Reilly said Tamaki’s people did some fantastic work following the devastation of Cyclone Gabrielle. He met with the Tu Tangata riding group last month. O’Reilly said the new gang patch ban was pure politics and theatrics to appease the masses.

Identified as Mohammad Shafi, a former Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), the deceased man was giving the Muslim call to prayer at a mosque in the city's Gantmulla area, reported Greater Kashmir. Police have cordoned off the area and more details are awaited. “#Terrorists fired upon Shri Mohd Shafi, a retired police officer at Gantmulla, Sheeri #Baramulla, while praying Azan in the mosque and succumbed to injuries. Area has been #cordoned off. Further details awaited. @JmuKmrPolice,” the Kashmir Zone Police wrote on X. The 72-year-old is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter, reported KNO, a news agency. A few days ago terrorists ambushed two Army vehicles in Poonch, killing five soldiers and injuring two others. This comes days after Jammu and Kashmir police dismantled a terrorist module assigned to target off-duty policemen in Srinagar. Three terrorists were apprehended for their involvement in the assault on a police constable in Srinagar's Bemina area on December 9. On December 9, police constable Hafiz Mohammad Chad was shot dead by the terrorists in Hamdania Colony of Bemina. They were identified as Imtiyaz Ahmed Khanday and Danish Ahmed Mala, both from Bemina, and Mehran Khan from Rainawari. The trio was operating under the guidance of a Pakistan-based handler named Hamza-Burhan, originally from Pulwama.",
