    "title": "Steve Sarkisian's battle with alcoholism: How becoming sober helped Texas coach reach College Football Playoff - Sporting News",
    "text": "\"Texas is back\" has been uttered more than a few times over the last decade, but only now do the Longhorns truly appear to be back.\nWith a College Football Playoff berth in hand after a one-loss season to finish off its Big 12 tenure, Texas sits two wins away from a national championship and boasts one of the nation's top quarterbacks in Quinn Ewers.\nBefore Texas completed the ultimate turnaround, however, coach Steve Sarkisian had to turn his own life around. Alcoholism once left Sarkisian's coaching future uncertain, but he's found a home as leader of a Longhorns program that has a chance to re-emerge as a perennial title contender.\nMORE:\nFirst look at Texas' 2024 schedule as SEC tenure begins\nHere's what you need to know about how Sarkisian overcame alcoholism, as well as how he credits his success at Texas to his long journey to sobriety.\nSteve Sarkisian's battle with alcoholism\nLike many public figures, not all of Sarkisian's battle played out privately. He took an indefinite leave of absence while serving as USC's head coach in 2015 after showing up to a pre-practice meeting intoxicated, and the school fired him the following day.\nOther incidents were subsequently reported, with\nESPN reporting Sarkisian's assistants believed he was intoxicated during a game against Arizona State two weeks before his firing. The Los Angeles Times also detailed a handful of alcohol-fueled incidents involving Sarkisian during his time at Washington.\nSarkisian's alcoholism battle was a years-long struggle, but hitting rock bottom at USC helped finally push him to get to the help he needed and stay sober.\nSarkisian told CBS Sports in 2017 that then-Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia's decision to take himself off the postseason roster and enter a rehab facility for alcoholism in 2015 inspired him to seek help. Even after rehab, Sarkisian continued to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\nA little help from Nick Saban also helped keep Sarkisian on the right path. Saban gave Sarkisian a chance early in the 2016 season when he hired the former USC coach as an offensive analyst. Sarkisian replaced Lane Kiffin as the program's offensive coordinator at the end of the season, but that stint was brief. By February 2017, Sarkisian was hired by the Atlanta Falcons as their offensive coordinator.\nSaban still kept Sarkisian in mind and re-hired him as Alabama's offensive coordinator in 2019, giving Sarkisian a chance to coach Tua Tagovailoa, DeVonta Smith, Mac Jones and a slew of other NFL talents over the next two seasons. Sarkisian's success in Tuscaloosa, along with his continued commitment to sobriety, ultimately led to his opportunity to become the head coach at Texas ahead of the 2021 season.\nSarkisian also credits Saban with saving his life. Alabama administers a comprehensive physical exam for its coaching staff before every season, and that exam turned up a heart condition for Sarkisian that required emergency surgery in 2020.\nSarkisian has completely recovered, but had the issue not been detected, he was \"potentially days and certainly weeks away from suffering a life-ending heart aneurysm,\"\naccording to Yahoo Sports.\nMORE:\nSN's College Football Playoff predictions\nSarkisian enjoyed a full-circle moment when Texas went into Tuscaloosa and upset Alabama in September. Without that win, the Longhorns wouldn't be in the playoff and potentially staring down a rematch with the Tide in the championship game.\nTo get there, though, Sarkisian must defeat one of the teams he coached while he was still fighting to overcome alcoholism. Texas will face Washington in the Sugar Bowl for a chance to play for a championship, and a victory would take a resilient Sarkisian one step closer to the pinnacle of college football.\nWhen did Steve Sarkisian become sober?\nSarkisian has been sober since he entered rehab after his firing at USC in 2015. He thinks about how his stint with the Trojans unceremoniously ended \"every morning when he wakes up,\" according to Yahoo Sports, and Sarkisian has used that moment to keep himself on the right path ever since.\n\"I think it really shaped me, quite frankly,\"\nSarkisian said in a 2021 radio interview describing the adversity he went through.\" Sarkisian added that his \"perseverance to fight through\" his battle with alcoholism has helped him better connect with the everyday struggles his players experience.\nNow eight years sober, the mere fact Sarkisian is standing on the sideline as a College Football Playoff head coach could serve as inspiration to anyone going through what the the 49-year-old coach experienced.",

    "text": "[Rory McIlroy](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/13/24100119/players-championship-rory-mcilroy-defend-pga-tour-jay-monahan) joined a bit of history at [The PLAYERS Championship](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/12/24099020/players-championship-2024-sb-nation-staff-predictions) Thursday, carding a record-tying 10 birdies during a 7-under 65 round. That places McIlroy into a tie atop the leaderboard with Xander Schauffele. After a disastrous final round at the [Arnold Palmer Invitational,](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/10/24096516/pga-news-rory-mcilroy-arnold-palmer-invitational-plummet) the Northern Irishman spent the last few days working on his game. “It’s probably been one of my best days in a while, which is nice,” McIlroy said. Those 10 birdies [tie the record](https://x.com/JustinRayGolf/status/1768333529807782305?s=20) for a single round at The PLAYERS. It’s also the most McIlroy has made in 641 days, dating back to the final round of the 2022 Canadian Open, per the Athletic’s Justin Ray. Only four other players have made 10 birdies in a round, with the most recent being held by Justin Thomas when he won here in 2021. Rory McIlroy: 10 birdies, tying— Justin Ray (@JustinRayGolf) [@THEPLAYERS]record for a single round and his most in a PGA Tour round in 641 days (final round of 2022 Canadian Open). McIlroy gained well over 3 strokes with his approach play today - a stark contrast from his early season struggles. [March 14, 2024] Putting has been one of his weak spots recently, but he leads the field thus far after picking up 3.593 strokes on the greens. His approach game was also much improved, which is another thing he has prioritized. The 2019 PLAYERS champion picked up 3.778 strokes in his approach game— the second-best in the field. He began his day on the back nine with three straight birdies. The four-time major winner added three more birdies to his scorecard in the next five holes before he dropped a shot at the 18th. McIlroy got back to 6-under on the par-5 2nd after making a tap-in birdie. His eighth circle on the scorecard came at the 4th, with another to follow at six. He dropped a shot on seven, where he recorded a double-bogey. That hole included a lengthy discussion between him, Jordan Spieth and [Viktor Hovland](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/14/24100734/viktor-hovland-pga-tour-jay-monahan-liv-golf-sweep-under-rug), on where he should drop after hitting the ball into the water off the tee. McIlroy returned to 7-under on the 9th when he made that historic 10th birdie from 17 feet. “It was disappointing not to get that up-and-down on 7, but that’s probably why I give it a little mini-fist pump on 9 to feel like I got one of those shots back,” McIlroy said. Rory McIlroy birdies his final hole of the day to tie the lead and cap off an excellent opening 65 at TPC Sawgrass.— Golf Channel (@GolfChannel) : Golf Channel & [@peacock]| [#THEPLAYERS] [pic.twitter.com/Yr9fzfsi0D] [March 14, 2024] McIlroy’s fist pump says it all. He was thrilled with his round despite hitting into the penalty twice. To make 10 birdies on [TPC Sawgrass](https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/3/12/24097805/pga-tour-players-championship-tpc-sawgrass-toughest-4-holes) is not an easy feat. “It would be nice to shoot 62 and not have two in the water, I guess,” McIlroy said. The last few years have seen him struggle on Day 1 of this event and put him in a hole. McIlroy won’t have to do that this week. “It goes back to I didn’t have many expectations out there today because I was like, ‘Okay, feels good on the range and feels good in practice, but let’s see how it is when you’ve got a card in your hand,’” he said. “There’s something to be said for that, sort of lessening the expectations and going out there and seeing what happens.” McIlroy will look to build off that 65 Friday as he tees off alongside Hovland and Spieth at 1:40 p.m. ET.

    "text": "BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) – Participants who have completed a series of workshops on groundsmanship over the past month have hailed the initiative.\nOver 100 men and women went through theoretical and practical sessions geared towards education and re-education on the rudiment of their crucial role of pitch preparation and outfield maintenance in preparation for the ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup 2024 West Indies & United States.\nFormer Barbados left-arm spinner Winston Reid, the lead curator for the Barbados Cricket Association (BCA), said the workshops were a good idea.\n“This is something that should be encouraged, and I know the staff here benefitted tremendously,” he said.\n“It was a wonderful eye-opener, an education in many ways; it was enlightening and interactive … and the responses I got from the others who participated, said to me it was clear they too benefitted in a meaningful way.”\nReid, who is based at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, the venue for the final of the T20 World Cup to be played on Saturday, June 29, had a hugely successful cricket career, playing over 100 matches at the senior level for Barbados.\nHe joined the staff at the historic venue 19 years ago ahead of the ICC Men’s (50 overs) Cricket World Cup 2007 and has supervised the work at the iconic ground over that time.\n“The reason behind the workshop was to improve in every way we can and to do better at our jobs,” Reid said.\n“We are gearing up towards the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which will be the biggest event we have ever hosted. We will be staging the final at this magnificent venue, so we want to make sure everyone is fully equipped.”\nHe said: “Not only for Kensington, but for curatorship at all the other venues around the island and the region. We want to see better pitches and fields and playing conditions for our players to show their skills and to entertain the fans in the stands.\n“So, this was a very timely workshop series, which augurs well for the game in the West Indies going forward.”\nSix territories in the Caribbean will host matches in the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup, which will be played from June 1 to 29.\nThe Caribbean, which hosted the event 14 years ago, will hold matches at Kensington Oval, Vivian Richards Cricket Ground in Antigua, National Cricket Stadium in Guyana, Daren Sammy Cricket Ground in St Lucia, Arnos Vale Sports Complex in St Vincent, and Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad.\nThe event will be the largest in the tournament’s history with 20 international teams playing 55 matches across nine locations.\nIt is the first time that the United States will host matches at a T20 World Cup, with 16 first round contests split between the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium a little outside the city of New York, Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in the city of Dallas in the state of Texas, and Broward County Stadium in the city of Lauderhill in the state of Florida.\nCWI manager of cricket operations and head of cricket for the T20 World Cup, Roland Holder, said the series was crafted by the organisers and designed to up-skill existing curators across the Caribeban by exposing them to international best practices for pitch preparation and applicable maintenance.\nThe former Barbados captain and West Indies batsman said the workshops were also designed to simultaneously expand the cadre of curators in the Caribbean by identifying new talent with the appropriate combination of theoretical knowledge and practical exposure, to lend further expertise to match venues to deliver a world-class event in June.\nA CWI Curators’ Manual was also produced in the lead up to the workshop and will be disseminated to the curators to help them in their work.",

    "text": "Margot podría alzarse con su primer Globo de Oro gracias a ‘Barbie’, película que cuenta con 9 nominaciones, entre otras, la de Mejor Actriz. Sale a la luz cuánto ha ganado Margot Robbie con la película de ‘Barbie’ Silvia Vázquez - 28/12/2023, 21:34 El ‘efecto Barbie’ ha llegado a los Globos de Oro 2024 gracias a Margot Robbie. Con un total de 9 nominaciones , la aplaudida película en la que da vida a la muñeca más famosa de la historia parte como la gran favorita de estos galardones y ha convertido a la actriz en una de las invitadas más esperadas de la edición.\nSu aparición sobre la alfombra roja de estos premios, considerados la antesala de los Oscar, no ha defraudado. En línea con la estrategia de lookazos rosas que siguió durante la gira promocional de la cinta por todo el mundo el pasado verano, Margot ha llegado este 7 de enero al Hotel Beverly Hilton de Beverly Hills en Los Ángeles (California) con (rosa)\nLa intérprete se mide esta noche en la categoría de Mejor Actriz de Comedia o Musical con otras grandes de Hollywood, como Jennifer Lawrence, Natalie Portman o Emma Stone. De salir victoriosa, este sería el primer Globo de Oro de Margot Robbie , que ya ha estado nominada en otras tres ocasiones anteriormente pero nunca se ha llevado la estatuilla a casa.\nEl estilo de Margot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2023: la antesala de 'Barbie'\nComo decíamos, esta no es la primera vez que la actriz asiste, deslumbrante, a los Globos de Oro. De hecho, en la pasada edición de 2023 fue una de las invitadas más aclamadas. Pese a que asistía como nominada a Mejor Actriz en una Película Musical o de Comedia por su papel en 'Babylon' , Margot ya nos dejó un aperitivo de lo que nos depararía el año al escoger un vestido rosa que parecía ser un guiño a ‘Barbie’ , cuyas primeras imágenes ya habían salido a la luz en aquel momento aunque todavía quedaban meses para el estreno. En concreto, optó por un vestido de tul de seda con transparencias y aplicaciones de cristales, plumas en la falda y broche joya en el escote , que lleva el sello de Chanel , ‘maison’ con la que mantuvo una prolífica relación durante años.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2023 con vestido de Chanel\n/ Getty Images 2021: postpandemia\nNo es casualidad por tanto que en 2021 la intérprete también confiara en esta casa francesa para pisar la ‘red carpet’ de los Globos de Oro, la última antes de la caída en desgracia de estos galardones que sufrieron el boicot de Hollywood . ¿Su apuesta? Un diseño estampado de la colección primavera-verano 2021 que dejaba los hombros al descubierto y que lució en esta atípica gala , celebrada entre Los Ángeles y Nueva York por razones de seguridad frente al Covid . Como productora principal de la película, Margot presentó el tráiler de la película ‘Promising Young Woman’, nominada en la categoría de Mejor Película de Drama.\nTodos los looks de la alfombra roja de los Globos de Oro 2021 24 fotos\n2020: alianza con Chanel\nDe la misma forma, un año antes Margot Robbie estaba nominada a los Globos de Oro 2020 por su papel en la película ‘Bombshell’ a Mejor Actriz de Reparto y brilló gracias a un look de colección de Alta Costura de 2019 de Chanel creado por Virginie Viard, con cuerpo de lentejuelas y falda tubo blanca.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2020 con look de Alta Costura de Chanel\n/ Getty Images 2018: primera nominación\nEn la histórica edición de 2018 que tiñó de negro la alfombra roja en respuesta al caso Weinstein, Margot se decantó por un vestido de Gucci con hombros estructurados y escote de infarto en el que destacan los bordados metalizados a modo de lazo y flores. Aquella fue la primera vez que acudía como nominada, concretamente en la categoría de Mejor Actriz Protagonista en Película Cómica o Musical por la cinta ‘I, Tonya’ , con la que además debutó como productora.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2018 con vestido de Gucci\n/ Getty Images 2015: su debut en los Globos de Oro\nNoticias relacionadas La escena de 'Barbie' que Greta Gerwig se negó a cortar a pesar de las presiones: \"Es el corazón de la película\" ¿Quién es Tom Ackerley, el discreto y atractivo marido de Margot Robbie? Para remontarnos a la primera vez que Margot estuvo en los Globos de Oro tenemos que retroceder hasta 2015. Su carrera había despegado poco antes gracias a su participación en ‘El lobo de Wall Street’ junto a Leonardo diCaprio, por lo que era de una de las primeras ‘red carpets’ importantes a las que asistía. Para la ocasión eligió un vestido columna de Gucci, en color marfil, con aplicaciones de pedrería y una abertura de infarto que le cedía protagonismo a sus zapatos ‘peep-toe’ en verde esmeralda.\nMargot Robbie en los Globos de Oro 2015 con vestido de Gucci\n/ Getty Images",
