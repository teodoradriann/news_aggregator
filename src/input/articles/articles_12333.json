    "text": "Organizan concierto 'Música por la vida' por Reyna, duranguense con cáncer; ¿cuándo y dónde?\nCLAUDIA BARRIENTOS\nPasar por un proceso de cáncer implica un gran desafío y muchos recursos económicos, inclusive si la atención se recibe a través de instituciones públicas, por lo que cualquier apoyo de la sociedad marca una gran diferencia a favor de las familias que atraviesan por esta situación que nadie desea vivir.\nReyna Sánchez tuvo su primer diagnóstico de cáncer a finales de 2023. A sus 38 años atravesó por un difícil tratamiento que duró más de un año e incluyó quimioterapias, mastectomía y radioterapias, logrando vencer el cáncer de mama.\nSin embargo, hace un mes, cuando estaba en el proceso para la remisión, se le hizo un nuevo estudio en Monterrey, ya que no se hace en Durango, y se le detectó un nódulo en la tiroides que también es cancerígeno.\n“Es un poco menos agresivo, gracias a Dios, pero a final de cuentas es una enfermedad que te la dicen y hay que darle desde el principio porque se puede ir para otro lado”, compartió.\nEn este proceso, su esposo y sus hijos han sido su gran impulso, pero Reyna requiere también el apoyo de la sociedad, ya que este tipo de tratamientos implican mucho dinero.\n“Es un proceso muy complicado donde no alcanza el recurso, así te estés atendiendo en instituciones públicas, y sobre todo cuando son privadas, no alcanza el recurso”.\nAgradecidos por el apoyo recibido\nAl conocer el caso de Reyna, varias personas con un loable altruismo se unieron para organizar un concierto para recaudar fondos. Es el caso de Laura y su esposo Roberto, quien hace tiempo atravesó por una complicación médica que puso en riesgo su vida. La familia recibió el apoyo de muchos duranguenses hasta lograr salir adelante, por lo que ahora están apoyando a Reyna para que también recobre su salud.\nAsimismo, quienes integran la Rondalla SEMS, así como la Rondalla EXA-ITD y el Cuarteto Minueto tuvieron la gran disposición de llevar a cabo el concierto “Música por la Vida”, donde todo lo recaudado servirá para apoyar a la joven madre.\nLa cita es este viernes 25 de julio a las 6:00 p.m. en el Teatro Ricardo Castro. Los boletos ya están a la venta, con un costo de 100 pesos y se pueden adquirir en la taquilla.\nTambién se puede apoyar de manera directa con los datos que se encuentran a través de la página Reyna Sanavi.",

    "text": "CHUKAI, Dec 31 (Bernama) -- The easing of weather conditions in Terengganu provides much-needed relief to keropok keping ikan (dried fish crackers) traders here, as it has allowed them to go back to their daily routine, including drying the popular snack in the sun.\nMohd Bukhori Zainal Abidin, 50, was met by Bernama when he was flipping the dried thin slices of crackers, said that the supply at his shop has been affected, due to the incessant rain since the beginning of the month.\n“Compared with last year, this year has been worse, as the rainy season started at the same time as the school holiday. A large portion of the crackers were damaged by the rain. We can only dry them today.\n“Fortunately, we also stocked up early for sales this holiday season,” he said.\nHe added that a batch of crackers, weighing 50 kilogrammes (kg), can generate an income of RM900, and is in high demand among locals and visitors, especially during the holiday season.\n“Alhamdulillah, I really hope that it will be fine weather till evening. Crackers that we dried today can be sold tomorrow.\nEarlier today, Bernama reported that the third wave of flooding, which hit Terengganu starting on Dec 23, has now fully recovered.\nAccording to the Terengganu Disaster Management Committee (JPBNT) secretariat, the last temporary evacuation centre in the state at Dewan Serbaguna Taman Perumahan Wakaf Tengah in Kuala Nerus, which housed six people, was closed at 2 pm today.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

    "text": "NBKC Bank has high-yield business savings in the form of a money market account. If you’re looking for a good annual percentage yield (APY) rate without the stress of maintaining a minimum balance or coming up with a hefty required opening deposit, then NBKC Bank’s Business Money Market account is a great option. You only need a negligible 1-cent balance in your account to earn 2.50% APY. There’s also no minimum opening deposit, which is one of NBKC Bank’s trademark account features.\nNBKC Bank is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)-insured online bank with branches in Kansas City, Leawood, and Overland Park. You can open an account on the bank’s website.\nPros\n- 2.50% APY\n- $0.01 minimum balance requirement to earn interest\n- Free monthly ATM refunds of up to $12\nCons\n- No branches outside Kansas and Missouri\n- Only incoming domestic wires are free\nFeatures\n- Free NBKC Business Debit Mastercard\n- Limited to six transfers or withdrawals per month\n- Online and mobile banking\n- No fees to deposit checks at the branch or via the mobile app\n- Certificates of deposit (CDs) and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans also available\nHow NBKC Bank Stacks Up With Its Competitors\nAPY\nMonthly Fee\nATM Fee\nMinimum Opening Deposit\nBusiness Money Market\n2.50%\n$0\nNone at NBKC Bank ATMs and MoneyPass ATMs; refunds up to $12 monthly for nonnetwork\n$0\nPrime Alliance Business Savings\n3.85% to 4.25%, depending on balance\n$0\nN/A; no debit card issued for savings\n$0\nLive Oak Business Savings\n4.00%\n$0\nN/A; no debit card issued for savings\n$0\nWhen NBKC Bank Is a Good Fit\n- You want to earn competitive interest: With a 2.50% APY on balances of 1 cent and above and no maintenance fees, you can open a money market account and earn higher interest compared to other banks’ regular business savings accounts.\n- You want access to a wide array of bank products: The bank offers business checking, CDs, and SBA loans.\n- You want to save on ATM fees: NBKC Bank refunds up to $12 per month for transactions made at nonnetwork ATMs. This is why it’s part of our list of the\nbest business savings accounts.\nWhen NBKC Bank Is Not a Good Fit\n- You prefer in-person banking but are based outside of Kansas and Missouri: NBKC Bank only has five branches in Kansas and Missouri—so you can consider Chase, which has branches nationwide.

But less than half of 1 percent are actually identified.\nIn Hawaii, advocates say sex tourism creates demand.\n“We know that traffickers are women also. So we have conferences here, we have military here, we have local people that still will buy sex from children. So we have to make sure that we’re getting out there and a child is anybody under the age of 18. Right? Because sometimes we look 17. And we look like an adult, but we’re not,” said Tammy Bitanga, program director of Ho’ola Na Pua.\nShe adds the average age of the first sexual exploitation in Hawaii is 11 years old, younger than the national average of 14 years old.\nAnd it’s usually by somebody they know.\n“It’s not the stranger danger, or the kidnapping type of thing. It’s more like it’s a boyfriend, it’s a friend, it’s a family member, and then you get involved in that experience,” she said.\nAdvocates for survivors are urging the public and government to do more to support children at risk.\nNonprofit Hoola Na Pua says It only takes 2 days for a runaway youth to be approached by a trafficker.\nAbout 69% of victims experience homelessness, while more than 60% have a history of being in foster care.\n“We need donors and supporters and community members to come alongside and join us with our programs. We have a mentoring program. We’re always looking for mentors in our community,” Bitanga said.\nThe public is invited to sign waving events across the state on January 11 for National Human Trafficking Awareness Day.\nEvents go from 4-6 p.m. at these locations:\nOahu: Ala Moana Blvd, Corner of Atkinson Dr & Ala Moana Blvd Hawaii Island: Hilo Bay Front near Kamehameha Statue and Kailua –Kona, Henry Street Kauai: Līhuʻe Rice Street, fronting Historical Monument & Garden Maui – UH Maui College Wear blue to show your support. Pre-made signs will be available. Register by calling 808-445-3131.\nParticipation will also include recognition and respect for the Blue Campaign, a federal campaign to educate the public, law enforcement and other industry partners to recognize the indicators of human trafficking, and how to appropriately respond.\nA Red Sand Ceremony will also be held on January 31.

    "text": "Un magico Diallo trascina il Manchester United alla rimonta sul Southampton: Garnacho titolare, Rashford sempre fuori\nNel 3-1 in rimonta del Manchester United sul Southampton di Ivan Juric, nel segno di uno scatenato Amad Diallo (prima tripletta, in appena 12 minuti, in Premier League per l’ex Atalanta), va segnalata la gestione che il tecnico dei Red Devils Ruben Amorim ha avuto per due dei calciatori più chiacchierati sul mercato negli ultimi giorni.\nAltra esclusione dalla lista dei convocati per Marcus Rashford, che per la quinta volta nelle ultime 6 partite ufficiali non è stato preso in considerazione dall’allenatore portoghese. La sua partenza è ormai imminente e nelle ultime ore è il Borussia Dortmund ad essere balzato in pole position su tutte le principali concorrenti, Milan e Barcellona su tutte.\nSeconda consecutiva da titolare invece per l’argentino Alejandro Garnacho. Primo nome per il Napoli di Antonio Conte per rimpiazzare Kvaratskhelia, che si trasferisce al Paris Saint-Germain. Un segnale chiaro della volontà dei Red Devils di non lasciarlo partire, nonostante il classe 2004 abbia aperto al trasferimento. Il club inglese ha sparato altissimo, chiedendo non meno di 70 milioni di euro per dargli il via libera.\nAltra esclusione dalla lista dei convocati per Marcus Rashford, che per la quinta volta nelle ultime 6 partite ufficiali non è stato preso in considerazione dall’allenatore portoghese.
