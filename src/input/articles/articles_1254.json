    "text": "In today’s competitive restaurant industry,\nusing AI to increase sales has emerged as a powerful strategy for boosting revenue and enhancing customer experiences. Conversational AI presents exciting opportunities for upselling and cross-selling that can have a big impact on a restaurant’s bottom line.\nWith AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, restaurants can provide personalized customer recommendations based on their order history, preferences, and real-time behavior.\nThe Power of AI-Driven Recommendations\nAI systems can analyze vast amounts of data to suggest complementary items, premium upgrades, or special promotions at the most opportune moments during the customer’s journey.\nFor instance, an AI chatbot might recommend a perfectly paired wine with a customer’s entrée selection or suggest a dessert that complements their meal. The beauty of using AI for upselling and cross-selling lies in its ability to make these suggestions in a non-intrusive, highly relevant manner, increasing the likelihood of customer acceptance.\nPersonalization and Timing\nAI-powered interactions with customers are one of the most important advantages as you can optimize timing and personalization. Unlike other systems, with AI algorithms, a customer’s past order behavior patterns can be analyzed along with other factors such as time of day or weather in order to calculate the best time to provide the offer.\nThis targeted approach yields additional sales and, in general, a better overall dining experience and consequently higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nVoice AI in Restaurants\nThe restaurant industry is embracing voice AI technology as an efficient, hands-free way to engage with customers.\nRestaurants can easily introduce voice-activated ordering systems that reconcile orders while offering up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. For example, a voice AI system could suggest to the customer that he add a side dish or switch to a premium beverage option during the ordering process.\nChatbots for Enhanced Customer Service\nAI-powered chatbots can serve as virtual concierges, instantly responding to customer inquiries and offering personalized recommendations. These chatbots can be integrated into a restaurant’s website, mobile app, or social media platforms, allowing customers to easily access information about menu items, specials, and promotions.\nChatbots can subtly introduce upsell opportunities by engaging customers in conversation and gathering valuable data on customer preferences. Sometimes, you can leverage the customer data to create targeted promotions for your email marketing.\nAI systems are very good at pulling large volumes of customer data and identifying patterns and preferences. For instance, if a retailer knows a client often orders vegetarian dishes, the AI system could suggest new menu items with plants or offer an attractive price cut on a plant-based premium entrée.\nEnhancing the In-Restaurant Experience\nWhile much of the focus on AI in restaurants has been on digital interactions, there are also opportunities to enhance the in-restaurant experience. AI-powered digital menus can dynamically adjust based on inventory levels, item popularity, and individual customer preferences. These smart menus can highlight recommended pairings or showcase limited-time offers, encouraging customers to explore new options and potentially increase their spending.\nPredictive Analytics for Inventory Management\nAI can also be crucial in optimizing inventory management, indirectly impacting upselling and cross-selling efforts. By accurately predicting demand for various menu items, restaurants can ensure they have the right ingredients to support promotional offers and special recommendations.\nChallenges and Considerations\nWhile the potential benefits of AI in restaurants are significant, there are challenges to consider. Privacy concerns and data protection regulations must be carefully addressed to maintain customer trust. Additionally, restaurants must balance AI-driven recommendations and the human touch many diners value in their dining experiences.\nConclusion: The Future of AI in Restaurants\nThe key to making it work is thoughtful implementation. However, continual refinement and commitment to using AI to augment, rather than automate away, the human elements of hospitality that bring dining out to life are the keys to success.\nWith AI technology improving, you will see more refined applications in the restaurant business. Predictive menu planning and AI-powered loyalty programs are but a few of the possibilities for improving customer interactions and driving sales.\nPublished by: Annie P.",

Investigações realizadas no âmbito da Operação Salus et Dignitas, conduzidas pelo Grupo de Atuação Especial de Repressão ao Crime Organizado de São Paulo (Gaeco), apontaram que os denunciados exigiam, de forma indevida, dinheiro de empresários a título de “taxa de proteção” contra ataques de dependentes químicos. Em áudio obtido pelos promotores, um dos acusados afirma que, caso algo acontecesse com algum dos comerciantes pagantes, 18 guardas civis seriam imediatamente destacados para fazer a segurança do local, revelando, segundo a investigação, a prestação de serviços de segurança privada durante o plantão do serviço público. Foi encontrada ainda uma lista indicando as empresas que haviam realizado o pagamento, assim como a data limite para o repasse de recursos. Considerando apenas a conta bancária de um das integrantes da milícia, houve a movimentação de mais de R$ 240 mil.",

    "title": "ASIA/MYANMAR - A Catholic church hit by bombing in Chin State - Agenzia Fides",
    "text": "diocese of Mindat\nMindat (Agenzia Fides) - The Myanmar army has carried out air strikes that have seriously damaged the Catholic church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Mindat, in the state of Chin, in the northwest of the country. This church had recently been chosen as the cathedral of the diocese of Mindat, erected on January 25 by Pope Francis, separating the territory from the diocese of Hakha.\nAccording to local sources of Fides, in recent months Mindat has been the scene of clashes between the Chinland Defence Force (CDF) and the Myanmar army. The CDF, which emerged in opposition to the military junta, managed to take control of the territory and, in January, officially declared the area as “liberated”. In several border regions, these militias have allied themselves with ethnic armed groups that have been fighting for greater autonomy for decades.\nThe bombing of the cathedral took place on February 6, but news of it has only just come to light. Several bombs hit the building, damaging the roof and stained glass windows, rendering it unusable. No injuries were reported, as priests and faithful had left the area due to insecurity and fighting. In recent days, local priests had carried out inspections of the church to plan for upcoming liturgical celebrations, including the consecration of the newly appointed bishop, Father Augustine Thang Zawm Hung, until now parish vicar of the Sacred Heart in Mindat. The attack has caused consternation among the faithful, although the community has expressed its determination to repair the church. “We are very sad that our church has been hit by the bombs. It is a wound in our heart. But we will not let ourselves be defeated. We will rebuild it,” said the local priest, Fr. Paulinus. “We are certain that the Lord will ‘bombard’ us with his grace and blessing: this will bring peace and prosperity to our people.” The diocese of Mindat, located in the south of Chin State, has a population of about 360,000 inhabitants, of whom about 15,000 are Catholics, in a region that is predominantly Christian of other denominations. The diocese has 23 parishes, 48 diocesan priests, three religious men, 21 nuns, as well as 40 minor seminarians and seven major seminarians. As the faithful of Chin face these difficult times, in the archdiocese of Yangon a special jubilee pilgrimage was held on February 9 to the Marian shrine of Nyaungbelin, in the Bago region, on the occasion of the feast of Our Lady of Lourdes. More than 3,000 people took part in the pilgrimage, praying for peace and entrusting themselves to the Virgin Mary.\n“Bishops, priests, religious and Catholic faithful, together with Buddhists, Muslims and Hindus, have prayed to Our Lady of Lourdes for peace in Myanmar and in the world,” said a statement from the diocese.

    "title": "South Australia's historic dry start to 2024 pushes farmers into serious and severe rainfall deficiency - ABC News",
    "text": "In short: South Australian farmers are dry seeding after one of the driest starts to the year on record for some districts. It was the eighth-driest and 10th-coldest April for SA since records began and there is little rain expected for the rest of May. What's next? Farmers are encouraged to plan for options such as stock containment and filling feed gaps until decent rains arrive. South Australian farmers say they are struggling to stay positive after a dry start to the year in some key agricultural regions.\nIt has been the eighth-driest April on record in the state and three dry months have pushed some growing areas into serious and severe rainfall deficiencies.\nBureau of Meteorology senior climatologist Jonathan Pollock said the past three months were the driest on record for parts of the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula and Mid North.\nIt has been a dry start to 2024 for many areas. ( Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology )\n\"That's the driest on record for that February to April period with data going all the way back to 1900,\" Mr Pollock said.\n\"We did get some above-average rainfall back in January, but since then it's been drier than average, and that looks set to continue in the short term.\"\nSince August, areas considered in rainfall deficiency have increased across parts of the state's Upper and Lower South East, Kangaroo Island, Lower Eyre Peninsula, West Coast, Mid North and Flinders districts.\nHoping for the best is getting difficult Evan Kakoschke farms just over 2,000 hectares outside of Sandilands on the Yorke Peninsula, where he grows wheat, barley and lentils and has a self-replacing merino flock.\n\"As a farmer I guess you are always optimistic looking to the future for the rain to come,\" Mr Kakoschke said.\n\"But the longer it goes, you start to think some negative things, that the season might be a little bit ordinary, but the forecasting, that's a bit of a hard one to follow.\n\"I reckon everyone's optimism has slightly diminished from where it was a few months ago.\"\nBuilding farming resilience SA Drought Hub director Stephen Lee said the hub was working with farmers to build their resilience for dry times.\nDrought resilience funding More than $500m will be made available to make Australia's food production industry more drought resilient, but farmers say there have been issues accessing the funds.\nRead more\n\"We've had a series of projects that have helped with decision making, whether it's around fodder for livestock or containment feeding, or on the grain side, dry feeding and decision making, that should aid in these kind of seasonal conditions,\" Dr Lee said.\n\"Given the very long history of successful farming in SA and the very large variation we see in rainfall within and across years, we know farmers in SA have developed and evolved systems to best cope with climate variables.\n\"And we're constantly working to further refine and develop practices that will help farmers continue to have greater resilience in the face of climate change and drought as well.\"\nReduced hours while waiting for rain Sally Zacher farms at Lock on the Eyre Peninsula and said they were doing what they could to get the paddocks ready for when the rain eventually came.\nSally Zacher has been dry sowing on her farm at Lock on the Eyre Peninsula. ( Supplied: Sally Zacher )\nThey are about a third of the way through and she said despite some rain at the start of the year, it was very dry.\n\"There is a plume of dust that follows me, but it doesn't hang around for very long,\" she said.\nMs Zacher said for many, farming was very much a \"nine to five\" job at the moment.\n\"We had our first home game of football and netball on Saturday and we had a huge crowd, which we don't usually have for the start of May,\" she said.\n\"Generally this time of year we have no one around, but most people are just knocking off for the weekend and starting again on the Monday, because there is just no rain forecast.\n\"But most people's idea is just get it in the ground … while there is still no rain around, it's not going to grow, but it will rain when it rains.\"\nFarmers are concerned about how long dry conditions will be sticking around.\nDry conditions expected to continue Andre Eylward is a farm manager at Mudamuckla on the Far West Coast and said this year was on par with what they saw in 2010 when they didn't have a season break until the end of May.\n\"That year didn't turn out to be too bad, so hopefully it's going to repeat itself,\" he said.\n\"We had about 25mm of rain in January and another 10 in early March, but since then there had been nothing.\n\"But with such a big program we have to have some of it in dry because it just alleviates issues later on,\" he said.\nAs well as being a dry month, it was also South Australia's coldest April for more 30 years and the 10th-coldest since records began.\nThe bureau expects dry conditions to continue for the rest of May, with a 50/50 chance of above or below average rainfall for the agricultural areas in June.\nABC Rural RoundUp newsletter Stories from farms and country towns across Australia, delivered each Friday.

She said, “I’m taking MasterClass members on a journey of self-discovery to unleash their full potential in everyday life.”\nDuVernay also amplifies diverse voices through her ARRAY collective and advocates for inclusion by serving on various prestigious boards. She has partnered with MasterClass and ARRAY’s Seat16 initiative to provide underserved youth tickets to see ORIGIN and free MasterClass access.\nOn Mar. 7, the Casting Society will\npresent the acclaimed director with the prestigious Lynn Stalmaster Award at this year’s Artios Awards. “Ava DuVernay is a visionary storyteller…a huge champion for casting professionals and an incredible collaborator,” CSA President Destiny Lilly shared, according to The Hollywood Reporter. She commended DuVernay’s “passion for inclusive and representative casting throughout her impactful career,” which has established the filmmaker as an industry leader.\n“In my film ORIGIN, the process of casting became the primary brushstroke on the canvas,” DuVernay said. “Working with my casting director Aisha Coley to surround our leading lady Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor was a joy and a thrill. Each of the actors in the ORIGIN ensemble are stellar…They are the latest in a series of extraordinary casts that I’ve had the…honor of guiding.”\nShe expressed gratitude for the recognition from the Casting Society.\nRELATED CONTENT:\nAva DuVernay Weighs In On Nikki Haley’s Civil War Remarks, Says They’re A ‘Wake-Up Call’",

    "title": "Pacific Islanders Swap Water for Sugary Drinks, Fueling Obesity | Mirage News",
    "text": "[One in two](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10685071/) people in the Pacific Islands is classified as overweight (with a body mass index of 25-29) or obese (a BMI 30 or above). This is a problem because obesity [increases the risk](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks) of health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, strokes and some cancers.\nWhile various factors contribute to obesity, limited access to clean drinking water plays an [overlooked role](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523051742?via%3Dihub) . Without a safe drinking water supply, many households may turn to sugary drinks as an alternative. This type of substitution increases the risk of obesity.\n[Our new research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13547860.2024.2424652?scroll=top&needAccess=true) explored how water insecurity in the Pacific island nation of Kiribati correlates with sugary drink consumption. We used survey data, including more than 2,000 of households spread over 21 rural and urban islands, to track locals' water supply and their consumption of sugary drinks such as soft drinks and juice.\nWater insecurity is a big issue in Kiribati, with households relying mainly on unprotected groundwater (40%) and rainwater (28%) for drinking.\nWe found households that relied on unprotected groundwater and rainwater drank 381-406 grams more sugary drinks per week than those with access to a piped water system. For households with water insecurity, this brings their weekly consumption to more than 1.7 litres.\nDietary drivers of obesity\nLocated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Republic of Kiribati comprises 33 low-lying islands (with an average height of 3 metres above sea level) and a [population](https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/kiribati/kiribati-country-brief) of 133,000.\nThe Kiribati archipelago is spread across a wide maritime territory, neighbouring other Pacific countries such as Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. This makes our results relatively generalisable to other enclaved countries and small island developing states in Micronesia.\nHouseholds in the Pacific Islands are already grappling with the dietary changes globalisation and urbanisation have brought. Traditional diets of fresh fish, root vegetables and local fruits have been partially replaced by processed foods and sugary drinks. These are high in calories and low in nutrition.\nThese dietary shifts, combined with water insecurity, create an environment that exacerbates health challenges and contributes to obesity.\nWhat can be done about it?\nOnly [one-third of the population](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13547860.2024.2424652?scroll=top&needAccess=true) in Kiribati has access to a safe piped water system for drinking.\nThe rest of the population use unprotected groundwater and rainwater. But they cannot afford expensive tank kits, filters and treatment systems to remove harmful contaminants in water such as animal waste and chemicals. Locals are aware of these risks and therefore look to other options.\nImproving access to clean, safe drinking water can be a cost-effective public policy that reduces sugary drink consumption and addresses the broader public health challenge of obesity.\nTo achieve this goal, a number of interventions are needed, such as:\nensuring households that rely on rainwater harvesting have access to tank kits, filters and treatment systems to remove harmful contaminants\ndeveloping seawater desalination plants that rely on clean energy sources. This would improve access to clean, piped water but comes at a significant cost\ntaxing sugary drinks to reduce consumption. In\n[Mexico](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2015.08.007), a 10% increase in the price of sugary drinks led to an 11.6% decrease in their consumption.\nClimate change will compound the problem\nWater insecurity in small island developing nations such as Kiribati are exacerbated by [climate change](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2009.07.005) . Rising sea levels are contaminating freshwater sources with salt, while more frequent and severe droughts are straining already limited resources.\nThese climate-related pressures make it increasingly difficult for communities to access clean drinking water, entrenching reliance on sugary drinks.\nThis phenomenon is similar in countries characterised by higher levels of sugary drinks imports and intakes such as in Niue, Cook Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Palau, but also for Australia's remote Indigenous communities for whom [access to safe drinking water isn't guaranteed](https://www.nationalwatergrid.gov.au/about/news/need-ideas-powering-safe-drinking-water-remote-communities#:%7E:text=Remote%20First%20Nations%20communities%20face,salts%2C%20metals%20and%20other%20contaminants.) and sugary drink consumption is [high](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/sugarsweetened-beverage-consumption-among-indigenous-australian-children-aged-03-years-and-association-with-sociodemographic-life-circumstances-and-health-factors/AFECE18993F097218F1C7B8E082F62BF) .\nAddressing water insecurity and obesity in tandem offers an opportunity to create sustainable solutions and build resilience against some of the adverse effects climate change can have on public health.",
