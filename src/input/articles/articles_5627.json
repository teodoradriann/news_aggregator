    "text": "Security guards at London's Science and Natural History museums are threatening to strike over what they describe as a “disrespectful and demoralising” pay offer, their union has said.\nThe workers are being balloted on whether to take industrial action, starting next month.\nThe United Voices of the World (UVW) union said the latest offer of £13.15 an hour by their employer, security contractor Wilson James, was “too little, too late”.\nWilson James, the firm to which both museums have outsourced their security services, said it highly valued its employees and remained dedicated to finding a solution to the dispute.\nA UVW spokesperson said the pay offer was below last year's inflation rate.\nThe guards, who are asking for £16 an hour, currently earn £11.95 an hour and are not eligible for sick pay until the fourth day of the absence.\nThey are also demanding more annual leave and compassionate leave.\n'Hard to make ends meet' If the ballot approves industrial action, guards would strike on an intermittent basis between 21 October and 3 April.\nScience Museum security guard Catherine Campbell said: “I feel demoralised and sad that I’ve not had a proper pay rise.\n“I’ve been a security guard for 13 years here and I’m also a fully trained first aider…This can be stressful to deal with. I am always happy to help and do my best but I believe this level of responsibility should be reflected in my salary.\"\nHer colleague Bayo Owolabi said: \"The rising cost of rent, energy, groceries, and transport has made it hard to make ends meet.”\nKingsley Ampofo, a security guard at the Natural History Museum, said he had to work overtime to make ends meet.\nGoogle The Science Museum is one of the most-visited attractions in London UVW general secretary Petros Elia said many of the guards, who are mainly migrant workers, protected millions of visitors every year and should not be the lowest paid at the museums.\nMr Elia said the museums’ decision to outsource its security work made guards feel like “second-class workers” and he is calling for the service to be brought back in house.\nA Wilson James spokesperson said: “We are actively engaged in conversations with our colleagues and formally recognised trade union representatives at the Science Museum and Natural History Museum and remain dedicated to seeking an effective pay resolution.”\nThe Science Museum and the Natural History Museum referred the Local Democracy Reporting Service to to Wilson James’s statement.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "text": "Gateway at Wynwood Office Buildings Facing $102 Foreclosure Suit\nBy\nJulia Echikson March 21, 2024 6:40 pm\nreprints\nCould the office malaise be coming to Miami? The Gateway at Wynwood, a new Miami office building that welcomed migrating tech and finance firms, is facing foreclosure.\nWilmington Trust, acting on behalf of a commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) trust, is suing the owner, R&B Realty Group, in Miami-Dade Court to recoup $101.7 million and seize the 14-story office property. Thorofare, Peak Rock Team Up on $40M Financing for East Texas Industrial Properties\nJust over a year ago, A10 Capital\nprovided $113 million to refinance the 418,337-square-foot building, which features 195,000 square feet of office space, about 25,000 square feet of retail, and 512 parking spots. The A10 Capital loan was later collateralized into a CMBS deal.\nThe New York-based R&B Realty completed the complex in 2021, touting its Wynwood location to new-to-market tenants arriving in South Florida in the wake of the COVID pandemic. The company had bought the 1.1-acre site at 2916 N Miami Avenue for $11.5 million in 2016 and landed a $76 million construction loan from 3650 REIT in 2020, before the pandemic hit.\nNow, Wilmington Trust is alleging R&B Realty Group stopped making payments on the newest loan in December 2023.\nThe lawsuit also goes after a 5,187-square-foot retail building across the street from The Gateway at Wynwood that’s leased to Chase Bank. R&B Realty Group, which is owned and run by the Rosenberg family, purchased the single-story property for $7.4 million in 2015, according to property records.\nA representative for R&B Realty Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Gateway at Wynwood made headlines for attracting high-profile tech tenants such as OpenStore, founded by tech entrepreneur Keith Rabois. Private equity firm Thoma Bravo, brokerage Marcus & Millichap, biopharmaceutical company Veru, and coworking provider Mindspace later joined.\nAt the time A10 Capital originated the loan, the property was 66 percent leased, according to a report by Morningstar.\nThe foreclosure suit against Gateway at Wynwood may be a sign of Miami’s softening office market. The pandemic heydey — when a slew of new-to-market tenants decamped to the Magic City and 830 Brickell broke records for nabbing rents above $100 a square foot — appears to be over.\nJust this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Related Companies and Swire Properties had amended their agreement to build a 80-story office tower in Brickell after failing to secure an anchor tenant.\nJulia Echikson can be reached at .",
