    "title": "Check Pics: Leh skies light up with spectacular aurora as geomagnetic storm hits Earth",
    "text": "The skies above Leh were illuminated by a breathtaking aurora display on Thursday (October 10) when a severe geomagnetic storm hit Earth. The rare occurrence was captured at India’s highest observatory in Hanle.The event was initiated by a potent coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun that arrived at Earth on Friday. The CME stemmed from an X1.8-class solar flare on October 9 and hurtled through space at speeds surpassing 1.5 million miles per hour.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has classified the geomagnetic storm as G4, signaling severe conditions that can potentially disrupt power grids and satellite operations.Such storms can make auroras visible much farther south than usual, with sightings reported as far south as Alabama and Northern California in the United States.Rare auroras in LadakhIn Leh, the auroras’ vibrant colours created a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of the night sky.The geomagnetic storm is a result of the current period of increased solar activity, with the Sun nearing its solar maximum, which is anticipated to reach its peak in 2025.This cycle has resulted in a rise in solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which cause auroras when charged particles interact with Earth’s magnetic field.The auroras seen in Leh were the direct consequence of these interactions, displaying dazzling reds that enthralled spectators.While the visual spectacle was breathtaking, scientists cautioned against possible disruptions due to the storm.High-frequency radio communications are already experiencing interference, and there is concern about the potential impact on satellite navigation systems. Power companies and aviation authorities have been advised to monitor conditions closely to mitigate any negative impacts.Residents and tourists alike were captivated by the celestial light display, while experts highlighted the significance of comprehending the effects of space weather on technology and infrastructure. This geomagnetic phenomenon demonstrates the dynamic nature of our Sun and its impact on life on Earth.",

    "text": "Family lost their home to bushfireOwner watched house burn on TV from work READ MORE: Brisbane family loses to house fire days out from Christmas\nThe mother of a family who lost everything in a bushfire said she saw her family home burning to the ground on the TV at her work.\nJulie Moody, her husband Craig and their children were set to host Christmas this year, a plan that went out the window when their Parkerville, east Perth, home was destroyed on Thursday.\nA catastrophic bushfire in the area – of the five emergency-level fires that threatened Western Australians over Wednesday and Thursday – has reduced at least two homes to ashes.\nWhile the blaze was burning through the suburb on Thursday, Mrs Moody had checked her security cameras to see how her family’s property was holding up.\nShe was shocked to see the fire was already at their pool and inching closer towards their three-storey home.\nA family lost their Parkerville home (above) on Wednesday to the Perth Hills bushfires, just days before Christmas\nMother Julie Moody (above) said her husband just managed to rescue their family dogs from the burning home after she saw the fire creeping up on their CCTV\nMrs Moody quickly called her husband from her work and told him the house was in danger.\n‘I rang my husband and told him to race home and he managed to get through the roadblocks to get the dogs out,’ Mrs Moody told The West on Friday.\n‘He had to go through the barriers and a neighbour’s property because no one would let him in but if he didn’t do that the dogs would be gone.\n‘The verandah and home was already burning when he was there. He said it was very hot but he had to go to get the dogs out.’\nMrs Moody’s worst fears were confirmed a short time later when her colleagues showed her news footage of her home burning down.\nWhile the family is grateful no-one was injured and their dogs made it out safe, they’ve been left with nothing but the clothes on their backs.\nMs Moody said she watched news footage of her house (above) burning down from TV at work\n‘It’s devastating. It’s heartbreaking. The enormity of it is just unbelievable,’ Mrs Moody said.\nThe family lost their home, shed, and several cars in the inferno – including the rally car driven by their son, Sam.\nFamily friend, Kelly Thomas, has started a GoFundMe to help the family financially recover.\n‘Craig, Julie and kids are kind, caring, hardworking humans who would do anything to help anyone in need,’ the post reads.\n‘Some would know them from rallying.

Arizona’s defense produced six turnovers on the night, highlighted by junior Gunner Maldonado’s two fumble recoveries and an interception. The Wildcats scored 28 points off turnovers to cement Arizona’s first bowl win since 2015. The Wildcats ended the season on a seven-game winning streak, their longest winning streak since 1998. It is also the first time since 2014 Arizona has won 10 games. Maldonado’s 87-yard fumble recovery, the first defensive touchdown of the season for the Wildcats, couldn’t have come at a better time for Arizona, as it snapped a streak in which the Sooners scored 24 unanswered points.

That’s exactly what they got. [pic.twitter.com/wlwWBaLQSg] — The Comeback (@thecomeback) [December 29, 2023] After going up 13-0 in the second quarter, Arizona’s offense tossed an interception and punted five times before finally ending the offensive drought by scoring a field goal to level the game at 24. After three quarters, the Wildcats were just 4-for-12 on third down, but midway through the fourth quarter, Noah Fifita had a couple massive third-down conversions. A key 16-yard completion to Tetairoa McMillan on third down came three plays before a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jacob Cowing on third down to put the Wildcats up 31-24. JACOB COWING 57 YARD HOUSE CALL🏡 — PFF College (@PFF_College) [December 29, 2023] It was Cowing’s second touchdown of the night. With his first quarter touchdown, Cowing set the Arizona single season receiving touchdown record with 12. The senior from Maricopa also moved into ninth on the FBS career receiving list, passing former Wyoming receiver Ryan Yarborough. Arizona then forced another turnover. Oklahoma QB Jackson Arnold was strip-sacked by Isaiah Ward and Jacob Kongaika recovered the fumble. After, a DJ Williams 19-yard touchdown run put Arizona up 38-24 to seal the victory. .
