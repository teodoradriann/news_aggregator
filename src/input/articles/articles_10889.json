    "title": "La grève chez Boeing pose un défi aux objectifs de production du MAX et à la chaîne d'approvisionnement, selon le directeur financier de l'entreprise - Zonebourse",
    "text": "Le directeur financier de Boeing, Brian West, a déclaré vendredi que la grève entamée vendredi par plus de 30 000 ouvriers des usines de la côte ouest des Etats-Unis compliquera la réalisation de l'objectif de production du 737 MAX et la stabilisation de la chaîne d'approvisionnement du constructeur aéronautique. M. West a également déclaré lors de la conférence Morgan Stanley Laguna qu'il s'attendait à ce que les marges du troisième trimestre de l'unité de défense et d'espace de l'entreprise soient négatives, comme celles du deuxième trimestre.\nLes travailleurs de Seattle et de Portland, dans l'Oregon, qui produisent le MAX et d'autres avions à réaction ont débrayé après avoir rejeté massivement un accord contractuel en raison de demandes d'augmentation de salaire. Cette première grève des travailleurs depuis 2008 intervient alors que Boeing fait l'objet d'un examen minutieux de la part des autorités de régulation américaines et de ses clients depuis qu'un panneau de porte s'est détaché d'un 737 MAX en plein vol en janvier.\nM. West a déclaré que Boeing avait fait des progrès en vue d'augmenter la production de son avion le plus vendu pour atteindre 38 exemplaires par mois d'ici la fin de l'année, malgré le scepticisme des agences de notation à l'égard de cet objectif.\n\"Nous avons bien progressé dans la stabilisation de la production et dans la préparation des 38 avions par mois d'ici la fin de l'année. Maintenant, il est évident que cela va prendre plus de temps\", a déclaré M. West.\nM. West n'a toutefois pas voulu commenter les détails de l'objectif, qui dépend de la durée de la grève.\nLa grève crée davantage d'incertitude et d'inquiétude pour les fournisseurs de pièces et de composants destinés à des programmes tels que le 737 MAX. Nombre d'entre eux éprouvaient déjà des difficultés à planifier leur production en raison des modifications répétées apportées par Boeing aux prévisions internes destinées aux fournisseurs.\nM. West a déclaré que l'une des priorités de l'entreprise était de stabiliser sa chaîne d'approvisionnement, mais que cet \"objectif devenait de plus en plus difficile à atteindre\".\nM. West a suggéré que Boeing cesse de prendre des pièces auprès de certains fournisseurs pour les programmes touchés par la grève et pour lesquels l'avionneur dispose de stocks suffisants. Le gros porteur 787 n'est pas concerné, car il est construit en Caroline du Sud par une main-d'œuvre non syndiquée.\nInterrogé sur la chaîne d'approvisionnement, M. West a déclaré que pour les programmes autres que le 787, si le fournisseur n'est pas en retard et que l'entreprise dispose d'un stock suffisant, \"vous savez, ne livrez plus\".\nIl a ajouté que ce message était diffusé \"du jour au lendemain et au moment même où nous parlons\".",

An investigation began immediately.\n“Due to the abhorrent nature of the messages, the officers, who were still in the probationary phase of employment following their graduation from the Denver Police Academy, were terminated from the Denver Police Department as of July 22, 2024,” a DPD spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe three fired officers are\nRodrigo Basurto, Meagan Joy and Scot Persichette.\nDPD did not name any other members of the group chat, but it said the remaining officers will get additional equity, diversity and inclusivity training. They’ll also undergo additional Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement (ABLE) training.\n“The Denver Police Department is appalled by the subject of the messages, which are contradictory to the mission and values of the Department, and disrespect not only newcomers and our community, but also every other officer working to keep everyone in our community safe,” the agency’s statement said.\nAll three terminated officers were reported to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) body, which sets rules for the certification of every peace officer in Colorado. As part of the Colorado Attorney General’s Office, the unit also investigates violations of its certification standards.",

    "title": "Virginia Ushers in a Zero-Emission Future with the Advanced Clean Cars II Rule",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking move poised to dramatically alter the automotive landscape, Virginia has announced the adoption of the Advanced Clean Cars II Rule, a bold initiative mandating that by 2035, all new vehicles sold within the state must be zero-emission. This pivotal decision underscores Virginia's commitment to confronting climate change head-on, targeting the transportation sector—the state's leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. With the rule slated for implementation on March 13, the clock is ticking for carmakers to pivot towards eco-friendly production practices, marking a significant step towards a sustainable future.\nDriving Towards a Greener Horizon\nThe Advanced Clean Cars II Rule isn't just about reducing tailpipe emissions; it's a comprehensive strategy aimed at overhauling Virginia's transportation ecosystem. By compelling carmakers to shift their focus to electric vehicles (EVs), the state is laying the groundwork for a cleaner environment and public health benefits. Projections suggest that the rule could save the state billions in healthcare costs by mitigating pollution-related ailments. This ambitious regulation emerges amid a backdrop of political contention, with some legislators, particularly from the Republican camp, opposing the move based on concerns tied to California's emissions standards, which Virginia's new rule mirrors. Despite these challenges, the rule stands as a testament to Virginia's dedication to leading the charge against climate change.\nPowering the Future: Challenges and Solutions\nAs Virginia prepares to transition to an electric vehicle-dominated roadscape, questions surrounding the adequacy of the existing energy infrastructure have surfaced. Dominion Energy, a key player in the state's electric grid development, has been at the forefront of efforts to enhance Virginia's electric car infrastructure. The goal is to ensure that the grid can withstand the increased demand for electric vehicle charging, a critical component in the success of the Advanced Clean Cars II Rule. While concerns persist, experts remain optimistic that with strategic investments and upgrades, the energy infrastructure will be capable of supporting the anticipated surge in electric vehicles, facilitating a smooth transition to a zero-emission future.\nA Milestone in Climate Action\nThe journey towards achieving a 43% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector by 2030 is ambitious. Yet, the Advanced Clean Cars II Rule represents a significant milestone in this quest. It embodies Virginia's resolve to combat climate change, not only through policy but also by fostering a culture of sustainability and innovation. As the state gears up for the rule's implementation, the narrative extends beyond the borders of Virginia, signaling a broader shift towards environmental stewardship and sustainable mobility on a national scale.\nIn essence, the adoption of the Advanced Clean Cars II Rule by Virginia marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle against climate change. By mandating the sale of only zero-emission vehicles by 2035, the state not only sets a new standard for environmental policy but also charts a course towards a cleaner, healthier future. This bold initiative reflects a harmonious blend of ambition, foresight, and responsibility, offering a blueprint for others to follow. As Virginia embarks on this transformative journey, the eyes of the nation—and indeed, the world—will be watching, eagerly anticipating the ripple effects of this landmark decision on the global fight against climate change.",

She suggested they have a quieter celebration but he begged her to get a tree, she recalled.\n\"He loved the holidays,\" said the Mattituck resident, 79. \"He always picked out a tree and it had to have a star, because the star lit the way.\"\nIt would be his last Christmas. The Rocky Point teen died of a fentanyl overdose on April 22, 2010.\nGET HELP\n- The Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, based in Westbury, runs a 24-hour hotline for anyone struggling with addiction at 631-979-1700.\n- The Long Island Crisis Center in Bellmore also offers a 24-hour hotline at 516-227-TALK (8255).\nOn Thursday, Phillippe — holding photos of her grandson — joined other members of the nonprofit Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and Suffolk officials at a news conference in Hauppauge to highlight the dangers of substance abuse and addiction during the holidays.\nAnthony Rizzuto, founder of the Long Island group Families in Support of Treatment, said that 10-14% of the population will suffer from some form of addiction and substance abuse. Officials encouraged anyone dealing with grief or anxiety during the holidays to seek help.\n\"It is the season of peace and joy and family,\" said the council's executive director, Steve Chassman. \"It is also a time for depression and for self-medication. It is a time of loneliness, and it's a time to let individuals and families know that although we understand self-medication in the form of substance use, this is also a high-risk time for residents across Suffolk County and Long Island.\"\nChassman said recovery is possible, noting there are 28 million Americans living in recovery from addiction.\nSuffolk County Executive Ed Romaine said the county was working with the council to let anyone struggling during the holidays know that help is available. He also emphasized that anyone drinking or using drugs should not put others at risk by getting behind the wheel.\n\"You should not have to face life's challenges alone,\" Romaine said. \"And if you are, consider reaching out, because we're particularly concerned about people who would drink and drive or drug and drive. We want everyone to be safe on our roads, and we want everyone to be the best they can be in life.\"\nDistrict Attorney Raymond Tierney said his office would seek to help those battling addiction by cracking down on people who sell illegal substances like fentanyl and other opioids.\n\"I will also send a message out to those who would seek to prey upon the vulnerabilities and the weaknesses of others,\" he said. \"If you are thinking about peddling this poison to your fellow residents of Suffolk County, you will be held responsible for that.\"\nHelp across the Island\nNassau County officials are also doing their part to help those struggling with addiction during the holidays.\nCounty Executive Bruce Blakeman said Nassau has issued public service announcements and police will increase patrols to look for impaired drivers.\n\"There’s a lot of different reasons why there is a spike every holiday season,\" he said. \"We work with our mental health experts and police to offer a wide range of services and we’re going to continue to spend a lot on mental health.\"\nAs for Phillippe, she said that even though it sometimes hurts to celebrate, she tries to honor her grandson's memory with Christmas traditions such as raising a star on her tree.\n“Whatever makes him come alive,\" she said.\nNo bail for alleged CEO killer ...
