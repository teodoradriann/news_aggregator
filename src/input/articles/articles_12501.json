Earlier this month, the Kazakh fighter submitted former title challenger Stephen Thompson at UFC 296, becoming the first man to submit “Wonderboy” in his 25-fight career.\nZahabi has an eye for talent, yet he knows that Rakhmonov is gifted but can’t exactly say why.\n“I was watching Shavkat, and I was trying to understand what makes this guy so great,” Zahabi said on his YouTube channel . “I still haven’t understood, but he’s great. I just don’t understand how he does it.\n“Guys, I’ve watched countless fights, I’ve trained countless hours and trained so many phenomenal, talented fighters. This guy is very mysterious. What is it about him that overwhelms these fighters? ‘Wonderboy’ is a phenomenal striker, and he was even slipping and countering ‘Wonderboy.’ It was shocking to me.\n“He out-wrestled ‘Wonderboy’ and choked him out in Round 2. Guys, ‘Wonderboy’ had never been submitted. … He’s never been (submitted), and Shakkat went in there and finished him. Shavkat is very special.”\nRakhmonov has picked up finishes in all of his fights, including six in the UFC. With varied submission wins and knockout victories, Zahabi is unsure where Rakhmonov’s weaknesses lie. As of today, Zahabi believes Rakhmonov has what it takes to become UFC champion.\n“Shavkat is something I can’t understand,” Zahabi said. “I’m intrigued. I can’t wait to watch more of him. I can’t wait to see what weaknesses this man has.\n“Can he beat Leon Edwards? I can’t say no to that. I cannot say no. I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m going to find out like the rest of you guys. To me, it’s insane what he’s done in the octagon. It doesn’t make any sense. None of it makes any sense.”\nMore UFC MMA Junkie's Fight of the Month for December: A bloody women's bantamweight war New UFC anti-doping policy details annouced, program to begin Dec. 31 MMA Junkie Radio #3424: Guest Eric Nicksick, Deontay Wilder loses, more\nBe sure to visit the MMA Junkie Instagram page and YouTube channel to discuss this and more content with fans of mixed martial arts.\nLike this article?

EatingWell's Editorial Guidelines In This Article View All In This Article Why Do We Need Iron? Heme vs. Nonheme Iron Iron Deficiency FAQs Close Iron is a mineral that is crucial for optimal health and well-being. Found naturally in many foods and dietary supplements, it is a key component of hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells responsible for transporting energizing oxygen throughout your body. Unfortunately, iron deficiency affects a large proportion of the population, with some estimates suggesting iron-deficiency anemia impacts more than 1.2 billion individuals globally. And iron deficiency without anemia is even more common. Research reveals that nearly two-thirds of people worldwide do not eat enough naturally iron-rich foods—yikes! Iron deficiency can lead to symptoms such as extreme fatigue and weakness, as the body is unable to produce enough healthy red blood cells. Additionally, individuals may experience difficulty concentrating, irritability, pale skin, shortness of breath and frequent headaches. The good news is that consuming sufficient iron can keep you strong, energized and healthy. Keep reading to learn what happens to your body when you consume iron regularly. Why Do We Need Iron? Iron needs vary depending on your age, sex and life stage. Most healthy adult females require 18 milligrams of iron per day, while most males need 8 mg daily. Here are some of the main health benefits of consuming iron regularly. More Energy “Iron plays a big role in keeping our bodies energized,” says Alexandria Hardy, RDN, LDN, owner of Pennsylvania Nutrition Services. “Without enough iron, our bodies struggle to make healthy red blood cells, which means our organs and muscles don’t get the oxygen they need. This can often leave us feeling tired and weak.” Bottom line, says Hardy: “Getting enough iron is a key strategy to making sure we stay strong, active and feeling our best.” On the opposite end of the spectrum, insufficient iron intake can hinder oxygen transport throughout the body, leading to fatigue, weakness and difficulty concentrating. 7-Day Anemia Diet Plan to Help Boost Iron Levels, Created by a Dietitian Better Immune Health Iron helps to strengthen the body's resistance to infections and diseases by facilitating the growth and health of immune cells. So, it is vital for the proper functioning of the immune system. Conversely, low blood iron levels may inhibit the activity of immune cells that normally help you bounce back from infection or help build resistance after a vaccine. For instance, one study found that people with COVID-19 who had low iron status were more likely to experience severe complications. A Healthy Pregnancy Iron needs increase during pregnancy, increasing from 18 milligrams per day to 27 mg or more in some cases. Iron deficiency during pregnancy is associated with several adverse outcomes, such as increased maternal illness, intrauterine growth restriction, or delivering a premature or low birth weight baby. Additionally, newborns with iron deficiency may exhibit poorer cognitive abilities. Mood Support While many factors can affect mood, iron status may have a surprising impact. Research suggests that insufficient iron may affect neurotransmitter production and brain function, potentially contributing to feelings of depression or anxiety. For example, one small study found that lower iron status was associated with depressed mood, functional tiredness and poorer memory. On the opposite end of the spectrum, regular iron supplementation has been linked to less stress and better mood among athletes. Heme vs. Nonheme Iron Iron comes in two different forms: heme and nonheme iron. Understanding the difference between these two forms of iron is important for maintaining a balanced diet. This is especially critical for individuals with specific dietary restrictions or preferences, such as vegans and vegetarians. Heme iron is derived directly from hemoglobin and myoglobin in animal foods, such as meat, poultry and fish. As a result, it is readily absorbed and utilized by the body. On the other hand, nonheme iron is found in plant foods like beans, lentils and spinach. While this form of iron is also valuable, it is generally less easily absorbed by the body than heme iron. However, nonheme iron absorption can be enhanced by consuming it with vitamin C-rich foods, such as oranges, bell peppers or tomatoes. The Best Time to Take Your Iron Supplement for Maximum Absorption, According to Dietitians Top sources of heme iron include: OystersOrgan meats, like liverBeefSardinesChicken and turkeyFish Top nonheme iron sources include: Fortified breakfast cerealSpinachTofuBeans, lentils and chickpeasBaked potatoesNuts (especially cashews)Peas 12 Best Food Sources of Iron Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency can manifest in various forms, ranging from mild to severe. Types of Iron Deficiency There are three main types of iron deficiency. The most common type is iron-deficiency anemia, in which a lack of iron leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin. This can impair oxygen transport throughout the body. Latent iron deficiency is another form of iron deficiency where iron stores are depleted, but red blood cells are not affected. Finally, there is functional iron deficiency, where iron availability is insufficient despite normal iron storage levels. Symptoms of Iron Deficiency Common symptoms of iron deficiency include fatigue, weakness and pale skin due to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. Individuals may also experience shortness of breath, dizziness or cold hands and feet. Additionally, cravings for nonnutritive substances such as ice or dirt, a condition known as pica, can occur. In severe cases, individuals might suffer from headaches, chest pain or even an increased heart rate. How to Know If You Need a Supplement If you notice symptoms of iron deficiency, consult your health care professional, who may recommend a blood test to check your iron levels. If these indicate you have low iron levels, you may require a supplement. But don’t go it alone. Too much supplemental iron can have negative consequences for your health and unpleasant side effects, such as constipation or stomach upset. In the event that your iron levels are low, your health care provider can guide you regarding the appropriate dose and form of iron supplement to address your needs. The Bottom Line Consuming adequate iron can keep you strong and energized and helps support your immune and cognitive health. However, many people do not eat enough of this critical mineral, increasing their vulnerability to iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia. Usually, eating a wide variety of iron-rich foods can provide the iron most people need. However, those who are vegan, vegetarian or pregnant may need to consume additional iron-rich foods or supplements to meet their requirements. If you are concerned that you aren’t eating or absorbing enough iron, speak with your health care provider about the best way to get the iron you need. Frequently Asked Questions What does iron do to the human body? Iron is a vital component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. It also supports muscle metabolism and is necessary for growth, development, cell function, and the synthesis of connective tissue and some hormones. What are the side effects of taking iron pills? “Iron pills may cause side effects such as stomach upset or constipation among some people,” says Melissa Azzaro, RDN, a registered dietitian specializing in hormonal health. “Some forms of iron tend to be better tolerated than others, potentially leading to fewer gastrointestinal side effects. For example, ferrous bisglycinate is often praised for its gentler impact on the stomach compared to traditional ferrous sulfate.”“Taking iron supplements every other day instead of daily is another strategy that may help decrease adverse effects,\" she adds. Why is too much iron bad for you? Excessive iron can lead to a condition called hemochromatosis, which may damage organs like the liver, heart and pancreas. Symptoms of iron overload include fatigue, skin discoloration, and joint and abdominal pain. Can iron pills cause weight gain? There is no direct evidence that iron pills cause weight gain. However, people with low iron who begin taking supplements may find that they have increased energy and, therefore, a heartier appetite. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

    "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- Jean A. of Elmont, NY is the creator of the Consuming Fire, a fire dampening tool capable of putting out fires in a home, vehicles, and more. The system features a box on the ceiling or mounted underneath a vehicle’s hood designed to dispense wet combined-chemical suppressant to completely eradicate a fire. The device includes a smoke and heat sensor configured to detect raised temperatures and excessive levels of smoke, triggering the system to dispense the extinguishing chemicals.\nThe market for fire dampening devices and fire suppression systems has traditionally been driven by factors like increased awareness of fire safety, stringent regulations, and the growing need for protecting lives and property. Innovations in fire suppression technologies can influence market dynamics. Companies that develop more efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective solutions, like the Consuming Fire product, may gain a competitive edge.\nJean was issued their Utility Patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and is working closely with\nInventionHome, a leading invention licensing firm, to sell or license the patent rights to their Consuming Fire product. Ideal licensing candidates would be U.S. based product manufacturers or distributors looking to further develop and distribute this product innovation.\nCompanies interested in the Consuming Fire can contact InventionHome at\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Inventors currently looking for assistance in patenting, marketing, or licensing their invention can request information from InventionHome at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)or by calling 1-866-844-6512.\nAbout InventionHome®\nInventionHome is a leading invention and product licensing firm focused on helping inventors and entrepreneurs through the invention and patent process with the goal of licensing or wholesaling client inventions.
