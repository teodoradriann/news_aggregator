    "text": "President Donald Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor over his “anonymous” essay and book hammering Trump during his first term. Trump went so far as to accuse Taylor of committing treason, a capital offense, for writing about what he saw during Trump’s first term.\nTrump also ordered the DOJ to investigate Chris Krebs , Trump’s election security director during his first term. Trump wildly suggested Krebs was part of an effort to steal the 2020 election as Krebs repeatedly said there was no evidence of fraud that he could find.\nWhite House staff secretary Will Scharf handed Trump a series of executive orders in the Oval Office on Wednesday and offered a quick summary of each one.\n“The central memorandum we have for you relates to Miles Taylor. You may recall that Miles Taylor served in the Department of Homeland Security during your previous administration. In his capacity with the Department of Homeland Security, he leaked classified information,” Scharf alleged, adding:\nHe wrote a book under the pseudonym “Anonymous,” making outrageous claims both about your administration and about others in it. What this presidential memorandum is going to do, one, it’s going to strip any act of clearance that he has in light of his past activities involving classified information, it’s also going to order the Department of Justice to investigate his activities to see what else might come up in that context, given his egregious behavior during your previous administration.\nTrump then offered some commentary before signing the order, saying, “And I had no idea who this guy was. I had no idea. I saw him on CNN, or one of them, I guess, CNN. A lot. He’d be on all the time, saying that the president is the president. I had no idea. It’s like, you know, in this office, you have a lot of young people, and they’re I’ll see him for two minutes, and I assume he was in the office, but I barely remember him. Barely remember him.” Trump added:\nIt was somebody that went out and wrote a book and said all sorts of terrible things or all lies. And it was like he was this gentleman or that gentleman, like I dealt with him all the time. I had no idea who this guy was. I said, ‘Who the hell is Miles Taylor?’\nAnd he made a living on going on CNN talking about the president. And I think what he did, he wrote a book, Anonymous, said all sorts of lies, bad things. And I think it’s like a traitor. It’s like spying, he walks into the office, he’s supposed to be sitting here. A lot of people, you know, I’ll be here and there’ll be 20 people standing in the room, there’ll oftentimes be young people in the office.\nI assume he was one of them at least. But I didn’t know anything about him and he wrote a book, Anonymous, and I always thought it was terrible and now we have a chance to find out whether or not it was terrible. But it was a work of fiction. He got a lot of publicity, got himself a nice job with CNN or one of them.\nAnd I think we have to do something about it. You can’t have that happen. If that happens to other presidents, it wouldn’t be sustainable for other presidents. I seem to be able to sustain. But if that happened to other Presidents, it’s just unfair. And if it was a Democrat president, I’d say that’s a terrible thing. A thing like that can happen, that’s a terrible thing. And it’s time to find out whether or not somebody can do that.\nCan they write a book about very confidential meetings? And, you know, because they happen to be one of a lot of people in a room, and they go out and write books, and worse than that, call it anonymous, like it’s a big deal, and everybody’s saying, who is it, who is it? Who is it then? It was found out who he was a long time later, and you got a lot publicity off that one. He’s like a promoter. But we’re going to find out whether or not somebody is allowed to do that. I think it’s a very important case, and I think he’s guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth. But we’ll find out\nTaylor served as his deputy chief of staff to Trump’s former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and, in 2018, penned an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times .\nWatch the clip above.",

    "text": "After Amazon’s recent decision to get employees back in the office full time, a senior executive has reportedly told an internal meeting that those unhappy with the change should resign, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-aws-ceo-quit-if-you-dont-want-return-office-2024-10-17/).\nBut the e-commerce giant may want to tread carefully. New findings from the International Workplace Group (IWG) show that two thirds (67 per cent) of recruiters have seen a rise in candidates searching for new roles after their current employers enforced a return to office (RTO) mandate policy.\nThe survey of 500 recruiters also found that three quarters (75 per cent) have had candidates reject job offers that don’t offer flexible working, while 72 per cent noted that businesses that fail to provide hybrid working options are becoming less competitive in the job market.\n[Majority of CEOs see a full return to the office within three years, study shows ](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1890265/majority-ceos-full-return-office-within-three-years-study-shows)\n[How to encourage reluctant employees back to the office](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1884751/encourage-reluctant-employees-back-office)\n[Employees demand pay rises if forced back to the office full time, report finds](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1888643/employees-demand-pay-rises-forced-back-office-full-time-report-finds)\n“You can’t force the butterfly back into the chrysalis,” said Claire Campbell, CEO of Timewise, explaining that “people’s lives have fundamentally altered” since the pandemic, affecting their patterns of care, spend on the commute, health, and involvement in family life.\n“These are important enough that people will leave their jobs to retain that flexibility,” she said, adding that a particular concern is the “potential impact on workforce diversity – with parents, carers and female colleagues most likely to suffer from enforced office working.”\nSimilarly, Gary Cookson, director of Epic HR, told People Management: “People have personalised work to their own preferences, and will be understandably reluctant to return to a more collective experience and set of arrangements. It isn’t surprising that those people resist RTO mandates or vote with their feet and leave.”\nThe high cost of commuting\nCookson further highlighted the impact of a long and draining daily commute: “The concept of five days a week in the office is premised on whomever does that having someone else to do all the cooking, cleaning, childcare, housework and other life admin – possibly unpaid.\n“That isn’t how most families operate. So it isn’t surprising that people reject job offers that don’t include the flexibility that most need.”\nA separate study by IWG, which surveyed 1,000 white collar workers who commute everyday, found that almost half (46 per cent) were actively seeking jobs that don’t require commuting.\nThe most common reasons for seeking new roles include the high cost (44 per cent) and time commitment (40 per cent) of commuting, with a third (33 per cent) citing the impact on their work-life balance.\nA fifth (21 per cent) of those working five days in the office reported daily burnout, while only a quarter (25 per cent) felt that being in the office five days a week was essential for doing their job effectively.\nAn [additional academic study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5031481) tracking over 3 million tech and finance workers' employment histories on LinkedIn found that firms enforcing RTO policies experienced “abnormally high” employed turnover.\nThis trend was particularly noticeable among female, senior, and those with advanced skills. These firms also took significantly longer time to fill vacancies and lower hiring rates after implementing RTO mandates.\nCould RTO mandates be reversed?\nSince the announcement that employees would have to return to the office full time from January 2025, 500 employees of Amazon Web Services wrote to their CEO asking for the mandate to be repealed. Could this backlash prompt a change?\nGemma Dale, lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, said she does not expect companies to u-turn on their decisions anytime soon. She told People Management: “I think companies like Amazon are not especially likely to change their minds, as it seems highly unlikely that this possibility was not considered, and the risk deemed worth taking. Only time will tell if that gamble pays off for them.”\nHowever, she noted that Amazon’s decision is not representative of all large companies: “Although we see the headlines when big companies mandate returns, there are many organisations who successfully implemented hybrid and remote work and continue to quietly reap the rewards. I think this will continue, as will RTO mandates for those that prioritise in person work.”\nIn contrast, Cookson argued that a “climbdown” from a full RTO is “quite likely” for employers like Amazon, or they will need to implement other cost-cutting measures to deal with the fallout of their decision. “Employers who have done a full RTO mandate are likely to already be suffering and the data proves that if they aren’t yet, they will suffer in future,” he said.\n‘A blunt tool’\nCampbell acknowledged that RTO mandates often stem from dissatisfaction with a company’s current working model. However, she warned: “There is a big difference between involving employees, consulting on what they think and mutually co-designing a hybrid approach, and a topline mandate that everyone has to adhere to, which isn’t grounded in business needs.”\n“Where employers feel that their current arrangements are not working well, rather than using a blunt tool of a return-to-work mandate, they should think about how opportunities for remote working can be implemented more effectively,’ Clare Kelliher, professor of work and organisation at Cranfield School of Management, told People Management.\nShe explained that allowing employees some autonomy over their working arrangements can bring benefits for employers too, such as greater loyalty and enhanced performance.\n“Each organisation has to establish what works best for them in the current environment,” Kelliher advised. “This can take time, and this is likely to be influenced by the nature of work that is done and their workforce.”\n“The future of entirely office-based working seems bleak,” said Cookson. “Whilst entirely remote-based working may be equally unattractive to some, a hybrid approach seems sensible – but organisations need to be aware that it is more than just asking people to work some days at home and some in the office.”\n[Read the CIPD’s advice for people professionals on how to get the best out of hybrid working arrangements](https://www.cipd.org/en/knowledge/guides/planning-hybrid-working/)",

    "text": "One of the most influential workers unions in Argentina has called for a national strike next month as opposition to the government’s overhaul of the economy builds.\nThe General Confederation of Labor (CGT) announced on Thursday that it is planning a general strike on Jan. 24 in protest against a series of measures put forward by libertarian President Javier Milei.\nMilei’s government sent a reform bill to Congress on Wednesday proposing far-reaching changes in an attempt to help resurrect the ailing economy. It includes changes to working standards and would pave the way for the privatization of state companies.\nIn a statement, the CGT, which brings together several powerful unions in the South American country, presented its “fighting plan.” Members, the statement said, will request meetings with lawmakers who are due to discuss the bill in extraordinary sessions scheduled through Jan. 31 to propose amendments.\nSeveral demonstrations against Milei’s agenda have taken place since he took office Dec. 10, although numbers in recent days have fallen behind expectations.\nMilei’s newly appointed security minister presented a “protocol” earlier this month to maintain public order that allows federal forces to stop demonstrators from holding road-blocking protests. Some social organizations have said that the protocol goes too far, setting up a potential clash with those pledging to take to the streets.\nOf the 42 general strikes called by the CGT since 1983, more than half have been during non-Peronist governments. Five strikes took place under former center-right President Mauricio Macri, who took office in 2015 and supported Milei’s electoral campaign.\n ",

    "text": "Un joven de aproximadamente 23 años de edad, fue asesinado a puñaladas por su exnovia, durante una [ riña ](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/cdmx/2024/6/12/rina-con-policias-en-iztapalapa-muere-hombre-en-pleno-enfrentamiento-entre-vecinos-uniformados-820149.html)ocurrida en la colonia El Salitre de la capital queretana, hecho registrado durante este miércoles por la noche. De acuerdo a la Secretaría de Seguridad Pública Municipal de Querétaro (SSPMQ), dos personas, una mujer y un hombre, fueron detenidos, y trasladados ante la Fiscalía General del Estado. Según información expuesta en un video a través de redes sociales, se desató una riña en la que participaron cuatro personas, en las inmediaciones de la calle Moctezuma de dicha localidad. Según vecinos de la zona, cuatro personas se encontraban conviviendo, aparentemente bajo el influjo de sustancias tóxicas, esto al interior de la vivienda donde residía la víctima.

La mujer y su acompañante entraron en una discusión con la víctima, la cual terminó en un enfrentamiento en la calle. El amigo del ofendido trató de calmar los ánimos, y en la trifulca tanto el e novio como la actual pareja de la muchacha se liaron a golpes; en ese momento la chica que habría tomado un objeto punzocortante del domicilio, asestó en al menos dos ocasiones fuertes puñaladas con el arma blanca que traía consigo en contra del pecho de su expareja. Ante esta situación el exnovio cayó tirado en el piso, y murió desangrado en la banqueta, acto seguido fue auxiliado por su amigo, y la pareja presunta responsable de este hecho, huyó del lugar caminando. Intervención policial Por tanto, vecinos solicitaron el apoyo de los elementos de la Secretaría de Seguridad Pública Municipal de Querétaro (SSPMQ), quienes al entrevistarse con testigos, lograron detener tras un breve dispositivo de búsqueda a los dos probables responsables, quiénes fueron consignados ante la Fiscalía General del Estado. Cabe señalar que la víctima era un joven que no era oriundo de la colonia, y de acuerdo con los habitantes tenía poco tiempo de haber llegado a rentar una vivienda. Personal del Servicio Médico Forense (SEMEFO) se encargó del levantamiento del cuerpo y su traslado a la morgue.",

    "text": "Blast of freezing air will have many in the South shivering to end 2023\nA frost and freeze risk will return to parts of the South, including Florida, to end the year, as the same storm expected to produce snowflakes in the Tennessee Valley ushers in chilly air.\nFolks headed South for warmth over the holidays will experience a polar plunge instead, with temperatures dropping below freezing in areas and snow possible in some areas.\nFollowing the season's first snowflakes in parts of the South this week, some residents may have to reach for winter jackets as some of the chilliest air of the season moves in through New Year's weekend, say\nAccuWeather meteorologists.\nThe blast of colder air will send temperatures at night below freezing as far south as the Gulf Coast and Florida, raising some agricultural concerns. For those from colder climates spending the holidays in the South, it might be an unwelcome return to the weather they are used to at home.\n\"While this is not expected to be the coldest air the region will see this winter, it will be quite a shock given the recent warmth,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty.\nThat recent warmth, featuring temperatures 5-10 degrees above historical averages in the days around Christmas, was accompanied by locally heavy rain tallying several inches. Fortunately, while the temperature will dip into the weekend, it will be largely dry for outdoor activities, including New Year's Eve celebrations.\nThe exception to that dry forecast will be in portions of the Tennessee Valley and around the Southern Appalachians, where\nsome snow showers can occur into Saturday morning. Except for the highest elevations, any accumulations should be light, representing the season's first snowflakes for many from Middle Tennessee to northern Georgia.\nAccuWeather meteorologists say that the same storm generating the snowflakes will also reinforce the chilly air over the region that will last into the weekend.\n\"The core of the cold will be on Friday and Saturday nights,\" said Douty. \"It is likely that Saturday night will be a little colder in most areas.\"\nTemperatures come dawn Sunday morning in places like\nGainesville and Tallahassee, Florida, will be at or below freezing, with the 20s even likely across interior Georgia and points to the north and east. For parts of the Sunshine State, it will be the first time temperatures have plunged that low this season, threatening some outdoor plants and vegetation.\n\"The frost risk will cover nearly all of northern Florida, about as far south as Ocala,\" added Douty. Fortunately, with the state's citrus crop mainly clustered in the central part of the state, where temperatures should stay above freezing, damage to this important economic staple is not anticipated this time around.\nFor the central and southern part of the peninsula, low temperatures on both days of the weekend will be in the mid- to upper 40s for places like\nOrlando and Tampa, while Fort Myers and Miami will dip into the lower 50s. Such temperatures are about 5-10 degrees below the historical average to close the year.\nDaytime highs in the 60s through the weekend will be several degrees below average and may be a bit on the cooler side for most.\nThe cold snap is likely not to be frigid enough to cause\niguanas to fall out of trees, a uniquely Florida phenomenon that occurs when the mercury is in the lower 40s or below for several hours in the southern part of the peninsula.\nThe iguanas—and many humans—will be happy to know that the chill will be short-lived, as temperatures are forecast to rebound closer to historical averages, and even above, as early as Sunday afternoon and especially through the first week of the new year.\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

    "text": "Family of Venezuelan refugees reunite in South Bay\nBy Loureen Ayyoub\nClick here for updates on this story\nSAN JOSE, California (\nKPIX) — Preparing authentic Venezuelan arepas is a family affair at the Nava Querales household.\nCamila Nava Querales helps her mom Maritza Querales prepare dinner. The ingredients might be familiar but the location is new.\nThe family fled political persecution in Venezuela and ended up settling in San Jose, California.\nCamila says, she doesn’t mind.\n“I think this country is so beautiful,” she says.\nThe Nava Querales family are a part of the nearly six million Venezuelans who have escaped their homeland since 2014 due to the country’s economic collapse and political instability, according to the United Nations.\nGetting from South America to North America was a remarkable journey. Carlos Nava, the leader of the family, faced violent threats for speaking out against the government.\n“My father was in danger in Venezuela so he had to leave. He went to Ecuador and we were separated from him,” Camila explained.\nEventually, they reconnected in Ecuador but were only permitted to stay temporarily. That is when they applied for asylum and were assigned to the United States as their new home through the help of the International Rescue Committee in Northern California. Since 1975, the International Rescue Committee has welcomed nearly eighty thousand refugees to Northern California.\nCarlos, a lover of free speech, says he is grateful.\n“I feel happy and blessed. Thank you, United States!” he exclaimed.\nFamily moments at home these days are a lot calmer. Instead of fretting about political spies barging into their home, the Nava Querales family can focus on things like learning English or enjoying a game of Uno.\nCamila says her dad is her hero.\n“He worked hard for us to come with him. It is better for our future.”\nA future that the Nava family hopes will reflect peace and safety.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

Compartir En el año 1963 se constituía en Totana la Cofradía del Santísimo Cristo del Rescate, siendo el origen en la ciudad de la Procesión del Silencio, también conocida como de las manolas, ya que en el año 1969 se incorporó la mujer a este cortejo. En 1972 se unió la imagen de la Santísima Virgen de la Esperanza y la figura de las damas ataviadas con vestido negro y mantilla, escapulario, rosario y velón. Más de 200 manolas volvieron a cumplir con la tradición y desfilaron el pasado miércoles desde la iglesia de Santiago por las antiguas y estrechas calles del casco antiguo. A la salida de las tallas y tronos, la Agrupación Musical interpretó dos temas con las calles tan solo iluminadas por las velas de las penitentes. Tanto las manolas, como los manolos, que son los nazarenos que procesionan con el Cristo del Rescate, mantienen intacta la tradición de no hablar desde que se enfundan su traje, ni desde su domicilio ni durante la procesión, lo que hace que reine un silencio sepulcral donde tan solo destaca el toque de un tambor y el sonido de los tacones de las manolas. Durante el recorrido, un tenor y soprano suenan en la oscuridad, mientras que, a la recogida de la procesión, los sonidos de La Madrugá impregnan la mágica y solemne noche.

I manifestanti, provenienti da varie regioni italiane, hanno espresso la loro opposizione alla chiusura dei luoghi di preghiera per i cittadini che professano l'islam. La sindaca Anna Maria Cisint ha adottato diverse misure durante il suo mandato, ma l'ultima, la chiusura dei luoghi di preghiera per i cittadini musulmani, ha scatenato una forte reazione. I manifestanti sostengono che tale decisione sia anticostituzionale. La comunità islamica ha risposto alla politica xenofoba della sindaca con una manifestazione pacifica. Migliaia di persone hanno sfilato in corteo con bandiere italiane ed europee, esprimendo la loro determinazione a far riaprire i luoghi di preghiera. \"Siamo tutti monfalconesi\", hanno gridato le donne, riunite a centinaia per organizzare la manifestazione. I manifestanti hanno sottolineato la loro doppia identità: sono di fede musulmana e sono cittadini italiani. Hanno affermato di parlare correttamente l'italiano, di pagare le tasse e di contribuire alla produzione del Paese. La loro richiesta è chiara: vogliono che la sindaca Cisint apra le porte a tutti i cittadini, indipendentemente dalla loro fede.",
