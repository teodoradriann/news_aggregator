    "title": "Escape milagroso: Sobreviven a colapso de túnel en Los Ángeles",
    "text": "Un grupo de trabajadores de la construcción en Los Ángeles protagonizó un escape calificado como «milagroso» tras el colapso de un túnel en el que operaban. El incidente ocurrió en el sitio de la masiva Extensión de la Línea D del Metro, un proyecto de miles de millones de dólares.\nUn desastre potencial se convirtió en una historia de supervivencia en Los Ángeles, cuando varios trabajadores de la construcción lograron escapar ilesos del colapso de un túnel. El dramático incidente tuvo lugar en una de las obras de la Extensión de la Línea D (Púrpura) del Metro, un megaproyecto de infraestructura que busca transformar el transporte en el oeste de la ciudad.\nSegún los informes, los trabajadores «lucharon sobre una pila de tierra para escapar» del túnel que se derrumbaba a su alrededor. Afortunadamente, todas las personas que se encontraban en el interior en ese momento fueron reportadas como seguras, sin que se informara de heridos graves.\nUn recordatorio del riesgo humano en los megaproyectos El incidente sirve como un crudo recordatorio de los peligros que enfrentan a diario los trabajadores que construyen las monumentales obras de infraestructura que definen las ciudades modernas. La Extensión de la Línea D es uno de los proyectos de transporte público más ambiciosos de Estados Unidos en la actualidad.\nSe trata de una extensión de nueve millas que se está construyendo en tres secciones separadas y que conectará el centro de Los Ángeles con Westwood. La inversión total del proyecto asciende a miles de millones de dólares, con contratos específicos como el del lugar del incidente valorado en $700 millones.\nLas obras, que comenzaron en 2019, implican la excavación de túneles profundos bajo una de las áreas más densamente pobladas de la ciudad, utilizando enormes máquinas tuneladoras y grúas que operan constantemente a lo largo de Wilshire Boulevard.\nContexto del proyecto de la Línea D El proyecto está diseñado para completarse en fases, con la apertura de las nuevas estaciones prevista entre 2025 y 2027. Una vez finalizada, la extensión proporcionará un servicio de metro crucial para cientos de miles de personas, conectando áreas de gran actividad como Beverly Hills y Century City.\nEl escape de los trabajadores, aunque afortunado, pone de relieve la complejidad y el riesgo inherente a este tipo de construcciones subterráneas. Mientras los angelinos esperan los beneficios de un sistema de transporte más robusto, el colapso es una pausa para reconocer el esfuerzo y el peligro que asume la mano de obra, a menudo invisible, que lo hace posible. Las autoridades no han informado de inmediato sobre el estado del proyecto de construcción tras el derrumbe.",

    "text": "UAE Armed Forces unification anniversary is rich in lessons and experiences: Dubai's First Dy Ruler Maktoum bin Mohammed S heikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, First Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, highlighted the significance of the UAE Armed Forces unification anniversary. He emphasised that this event is rich in lessons and experiences, serving as a reminder of the wisdom, dedication, and generosity of the UAE's founding fathers. These leaders made the decision to unite the UAE armed forces to equip the young nation with strength and resilience. In a speech on the occasion of the 48th anniversary of the unification of the armed forces, Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed emphasised the significance of the May 6, 1976 anniversary. He noted that this date holds additional importance as it signifies the commencement of the UAE armed forces' development journey. These forces have now attained a high level of skill, capability, and preparedness that align with the exemplary Emirati model. This model is structured to encompass all the necessary components of self-sufficiency to support growth, advancement, and resilience. The following is the text of his speech on this occasion: \"It is my honour to share with our wise leadership and the dear sons and daughters of the UAE the celebration of the 48th anniversary of the unification of the UAE Armed Forces. This occasion, full of lessons and experiences, reminds us of the wisdom, dedication, and giving of our founding fathers, led by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. They came together on the decision to unify our armed forces to empower our young country with the means of strength and resilience, and to pave the way for deepening the unity of our Emirati family and strengthening our comprehensive national identity. On May 6, 1976, the unification of our armed forces marked a pivotal moment. It not only completed a key pillar of the UAE's foundation, but also set in motion the development of a powerful military that embodies the spirit of our nation. These forces, renowned for their efficiency, capability, and readiness, are a cornerstone of our self-sustaining Emirati model, ensuring continued progress and strength. The rapid localisation of all ranks stands as a testament to the success of this initiative. Furthermore, the armed forces have played a pioneering role in diversifying the economy by establishing a strong presence in the defense industry, paving the way for private sector involvement in this critical field. Our armed forces have represented the UAE in participation with international forces for peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and assisting those affected by conflicts and natural disasters. Our leaders have supported the armed forces in their development and progress. Special thanks to President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, for his leadership in enhancing our armed forces and defence industry. We honour the officers and soldiers for their loyalty, dedication, and bravery in both peace and wartime. We also acknowledge their colleagues who have made sacrifices, along with their families. On this important occasion, we reaffirm our commitment to our leaders by demonstrating loyalty and dedication to safeguard our nation's interests and uphold their achievements while striving for new successes.\" (ANI/WAM) ✔️ UAE Armed Forces unification anniversary is rich in lessons and experiences: Dubai's First Dy Ruler Maktoum bin Mohammed 💕 Found this article helpful?

    "title": "Millions of obese patients taking Ozempic are at risk of gaining MORE weight – because they don’t take the drug for long enough, experts warn",
    "text": "Few words were more on people’s lips in 2023 than Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.\nSuccessful weight loss medications, which work by suppressing hunger hormones, are very effective.\nBut now, experts warn that many of the nine million prescriptions given for these drugs could be, at best, useless and, at worst, putting patients at even greater risk of suffering from drug-related illnesses. weight.\nThis is because many are given courses of the medication that are too short.\nAccording to recent warnings, employers are offering insurance plans that only cover use of the drug for a short period, such as a year, to save money.\nHowever, a growing body of evidence shows that patients who stop taking weekly injectable medications quickly regain the pounds they lost.\nAbout 9 million Ozempic prescriptions were issued in early 2022 alone.\nWhat’s more, abruptly stopping medications puts patients at greater risk for weight-related health problems, such as high blood pressure, high blood glucose levels, and changes in cholesterol.\nThe effects of abruptly stopping weight-loss medications are similar to those of harmful yo-yo dieting, which causes a cycle of weight loss and regain that contributes to the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and eating disorders.\nBrooke Boyarsky Pratt, a prescriber and CEO of the Knownwell weight loss clinic in New York, says she has seen many patients who were told they would stop taking the medication after 12 months.\n“I think it will be a compelling narrative given the number of patients who qualify for these drugs and their high cost,” he told Fierce Healthcare.\n“The difficulty is that there is no data to support that (weight loss after one year) and, in fact, the data very clearly suggests the opposite.”\nThe problem lies with healthcare companies that employers are increasingly using to get good insurance for their employees.\nOne of the most popular companies that does this is Calibrate, which primarily prescribes medications directly to patients.\nIt also works with insurance companies to get patients the drug for about $25 a month.\nMore recently, it has begun helping employers negotiate better, lower-cost insurance deals for workers.\nAs part of this, Calibrate is launching plans that provide a limited course of medications before tapering them off to patients, a way to reduce costs for the employer.\nA UK study found that people who used Wegovy experienced rapid weight loss, losing 18% of their weight in 68 weeks. They regained two-thirds of that weight, or 12% of their original body weight, in the year after stopping the weekly injections. Experts say the drug should be used throughout life to avoid weight loss\nThe most recent anti-obesity drug to hit the market was Eli Lilly’s Zebpound, a rebranding of the pharmaceutical giant’s existing type 2 diabetes drug, Mounjaro.\nBoth medications contain the active ingredient tirzepatide, which suppresses two hormones that regulate appetite, making people feel fuller for longer.\nOther blockbusters include Wegovy and Ozempic, the same drugs but in different doses containing semaglutide, which stimulates weight loss by mimicking the actions of GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone in the brain that regulates appetite and feeling of satiety. .\nWhile extremely effective at helping patients lose an average of 15 to 20 percent of their body weight, the medications cost a little more than $1,300 per package, which breaks down to nearly $270 per week or about $16,190 per anus. Insurance doesn’t always pay the bill.\nCalibrate specializes in working directly with consumers who pay a one-time fee of approximately $1,700 to gain access to personalized health counseling and, if eligible, a prescription for a weight loss medication for an additional cost per dose.\nThe company then negotiates with insurers to have patients shell out a monthly cost of $25 or less. But the company has struggled to give patients timely access to drugs amid shortages and insurers reducing coverage.\nNow, Calibrate is working with employers who provide health insurance to workers and with the insurance companies themselves.\nThe goal is to have the Calibrate program, including the medications your doctors prescribe, covered by insurance plans that employers purchase for their employees.\nCompanies like Ro and Calibrate describe their weight loss programs that include medications as the most effective approach to achieving sustainable weight loss. But they fail to make it clear that most people need to continue taking medications to maintain weight.\nBrooke Boyarsky Pratt, founder and CEO of weight loss clinic Knowwell, said\nFierce healthcare: ‘I think we’re going to see more and more LPG-1 companies that were previously business-to-consumer now selling into the employer space, claiming they have the silver bullet for spending LPG-1.\n“We’re hearing from employers everywhere that this is what they’re being told.”\nCalibrate said it has designed a program to help patients taking the drugs reduce their dosage and eventually stop taking them altogether, a benefit to insurers who would not need to cover the expensive medications indefinitely.\nA Calibrate spokesperson said: “While the current clinical paradigm for GLP-1 treatment requires lifelong medication at the highest dose, Calibrate is exploring whether members can stop taking the medication while maintaining their results.”\n“As a result, Calibrate is the first and only program with a proactive plan to get members off medications.”\nCalibrate conducted its own analysis to see if its members could maintain weight, reporting that 93 percent suffered more than 10 percent weight loss six to 12 months after starting to taper off GLP-1 medications.\nInfluencer Remi Bader said she “gained back twice as much weight” after stopping taking Ozempic, which she had been prescribed to help her deal with binge eating.\nThe latest data showing the rebound between weight loss and gain comes from a study conducted in\nJAMA, which revealed that tirzepatide, which works like Ozempic, helped patients lose about 20 percent of their body weight after 36 weeks. But when they switched to a placebo, they regained 14 percent of the weight they lost over the next 52 weeks.\nThe authors said: “At least five trials (including the present study) with various classes of drugs, including powerful anti-obesity drugs such as semaglutide, have shown substantial weight regain after smoking cessation.”\nStudies on the effects of stopping Wegovy and Ozempic have provided similar results. A 2022 study in the journal\nDiabetes, Obesity and Metabolism reported that patients taking semaglutide for 68 weeks lost an average of 17.3 percent of their body weight.\nWhen they stopped treatment, they regained 11.6 percent of the weight lost at week 120, resulting in a net weight loss of just under six percent of body weight.\nsaid Dr. Ania Jastreboff, an obesity medicine expert at Yale University.\nPeople: If you have a patient who has high blood pressure, has hypertension, and you start them on an antihypertensive medication and their blood pressure improves, what would happen if you stopped that medication?\nMedications like Ozempic and Wegovy are not a panacea for obesity, which experts say is a chronic disease that requires ongoing medication treatment as well as healthy lifestyle habits that include exercise and a healthy diet.\n‘Well, his blood pressure would go up again, and we’re not surprised. The same goes for anti-obesity medications.’\nDoctors say this is because the medications do not treat all the underlying causes of obesity, including poor lifestyle habits and a warped psychological relationship with food.\nDr Elie Jarrouge, a Houston-based metabolic disease expert, said: ‘For people taking Ozempic or Wegovy to lose weight… What is your exit strategy?\n“If you don’t work to change what you eat, not just how much you eat and your relationship with food, you’re likely to gain the weight back.”\nInfluencer Remi Bader attested to this, having regained “double the weight” she had lost while taking Ozempic.\nBader had sought treatment for binge eating disorder, which she said got much worse when she stopped taking the medication.\nShe said: “I saw a doctor and they said: it’s 100% because I took Ozempic.”\n‘It made me think I wasn’t hungry for so long that I lost some weight. I didn’t want to obsess over being in this for the long haul. I thought: I bet as soon as I get out I’ll starve again. I did and my binge eating got much worse. “So I blamed Ozempic.”",

    "text": "Want to kick off 2024 by being more organised and keeping your resolutions in check? Here are some DIY crafts that can help you achieve your goals — be it saving money to buy a new cricket bat or scoring A+ in every subject.\nSavings jar\nMaterials needed\nMason jar\nAcrylic paint\nPaintbrushes\nPencil\nScissors\nPiece of cardboard\nGlue\nMethod\nTo start, thoroughly clean and dry your mason jar. Up will only be needing the jar for this craft, not the lid.\nPaint the jar white and let it air dry.\nOnce dry, you can start painting your desired designs. Be it a rainbow, cartoon characters or just some squiggly. Use as many colours as you like and let your creativity flow.\nNext, trace a circle on the cardboard with your pencil and get an adult to help you cut it. The circle has to be the same size as the mouth of the mason jar.\nCut a slit in the middle of the circle — big enough for coins and notes to fit in.\nPaint the circle the colour of your choice and let it dry completely.\nFirmly stick the circle to the top of the mason jar with glue and your savings jar is ready!\nMini scrapbook\nMaterials needed\nUnruled A4 book\nChart paper (in multiple colours)\nScissors\nStapler\nGlue\nVarious photos and memorabilia\nMethod\nOn the first page, you can name your scrapbook how you like. Something along the line of ‘My Memories’.\nNext, you can start by dividing your A4 book into 12 equal parts, one for each month. Make sure each month has at least 3-4 pages.\nAt the start of each month, you can write the name of the month in bold colours and start decorating the page. You can stick photos, movie tickets or any other memorabilia. You can also mention how your resolutions are faring.\nIn addition to memorabilia, cut two squares of chart paper — In one square, you can write things that you are grateful for, and in the other can write your favourite moment from that month. You can stick the chart paper in the book, and decorate as you wish.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 05 January 2024, 21:05 IST)",

    "text": "‘Jersey Shore’: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Moved Into a $1.2 Million Miami Home Ahead of ‘Family Vacation’ Season 7 MTV’s [Jersey Shore: Family Vacation](https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/jersey-shore-family-vacation/) Season 7 will be here before fans know it, and we can’t wait to see [Ronnie Ortiz-Magro back in the spotlight](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jersey-shore-ronnie-ortiz-magro-is-back-but-is-the-cast-convinced-hes-changed-fans-say-no.html/) with the rest of the cast. Ronnie’s made headlines for several negative reasons. But it seems he got a fresh start in Miami with a $1.2 million home.

Fans know them well for their on-again, off-again relationship that spanned all six seasons of Jersey Shore. They both went on to have lives outside of reality TV.

It contains new features, such as LED lighting, a camera system, and water softeners and purifiers. The house boasts an inground pool with a cascade and a three-car garage with its own air conditioning unit. Of course, Ronnie also has a tanning area. Before Ronnie committed to living in Miami, he lived in Los Angeles. The Jersey Shore star purchased a home in LA for $1.9 million in 2020, and he sold it for $2.6 million in February 2023. It appears Ronnie was willing to downsize, too, as his LA home spanned 5,800 square feet with five beds, six baths, and a large gym. As for what Ronnie’s doing in Miami, he teased that he wanted to open a sneaker store called Sneaker Clinic in a past episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. “I felt like I needed a change of scenery and a change of just pace in my life, so I decided to move from LA to Miami,” the star said. He sued his ex-girlfriend, Jenn Harley, over their Las Vegas home in 2021 Fans will find out Ronnie Ortiz-Magro’s relationship status in Jersey Shore: Family Vacation Season 7. In the past, [he dated Jenn Harley](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/ronnie-ortiz-magro-jenn-harley-now-reportedly-moving-miami-not-together.html/), and they now share a daughter. And in 2021, he had to deal with the Las Vegas home he shared with Jenn when they dated. [TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-sues-jenn-harley-las-vegas-home-force-sale-jersey-shore/) reported Ronnie tried to force Jenn to sell their home so he could move forward with some extra cash. According to the report, Ronnie claimed Jenn borrowed bank money to buy the home during their relationship. However, he said she stopped making payments on the house loan after he moved out. Ronnie also claimed there were liens on the home due to unpaid home improvements that he didn’t know Jenn had done. Ronnie wanted to sell the home and move forward, but Jenn allegedly refused. All in all, Ronnie hoped he could get a judge to force Jenn to sell the home so he could collect his payment. We imagine Ronnie’s happy to have this case behind him.

    "text": "Recibir esta vacuna redujo el riesgo de demencia en los adultos mayores en un 20%\nUn estudio de la Universidad de Stanford sugiere que la vacuna contra el herpes zóster podría reducir el riesgo de demencia en un 20%.\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO.- Un estudio reciente de la Universidad de Stanford ha encontrado evidencia que sugiere que una vacuna ya existente podría ayudar a prevenir la demencia. Se trata de la vacuna contra el herpes zóster, una enfermedad que provoca dolorosas erupciones en la piel. La investigación analizó los registros de salud de más de 280,000 adultos mayores en Gales y reveló que aquellos que recibieron esta vacuna tenían un 20% menos de probabilidades de desarrollar demencia en los siguientes siete años.\nHallazgos sobre la vacuna contra el herpes zóster\nEl doctor Pascal Geldsetzer, profesor asistente de medicina en Stanford, destacó la importancia del hallazgo. “Fue un resultado realmente sorprendente”, afirmó. Además, enfatizó que la relación entre la vacuna y la reducción del riesgo de demencia se mantuvo constante bajo distintos métodos de análisis de datos.\nAunque aún no se conoce con certeza el mecanismo detrás de esta relación, los científicos creen que la vacuna podría reducir la inflamación neuronal, un factor asociado al desarrollo de enfermedades neurodegenerativas como la demencia.\nUn estudio con un enfoque innovador\nLo que hace a este estudio particularmente valioso es su diseño. En Gales, una política de salud pública permitió que solo las personas que cumplieron 80 años después del 1 de septiembre de 2013 recibieran la vacuna. Aquellos que habían cumplido 80 años justo antes de esa fecha no eran elegibles. Esto permitió comparar dos grupos de personas con características similares y determinar el impacto de la vacuna con mayor precisión.\n“Si tomas mil personas nacidas en una semana y mil nacidas una semana después, en promedio no debería haber diferencias significativas entre ellos, salvo la elegibilidad para la vacuna”, explicó Geldsetzer. “Este tipo de diseño es casi como un ensayo clínico aleatorizado, lo que le da una fortaleza excepcional a los resultados”.\nEl estudio también confirmó un patrón observado en investigaciones previas: el efecto protector de la vacuna es más pronunciado en mujeres que en hombres. Esto podría deberse a que las mujeres tienen mayor riesgo de padecer herpes zóster.\nOtras vacunas y su relación con la demencia\nEl estudio de Stanford no es el único que sugiere una conexión entre las vacunas y un menor riesgo de demencia. Investigaciones previas han encontrado que la vacuna recombinante contra el herpes zóster, Shingrix, también está asociada con una reducción del 17% en el riesgo de demencia en comparación con su predecesora, Zostavax.\nPor otro lado, un estudio de UTHealth Houston en 2023 descubrió que las vacunas contra el tétanos y la difteria podrían estar vinculadas a un menor riesgo de padecer Alzheimer. Además, otra investigación publicada en 2022 encontró que las personas que recibieron al menos una vacuna contra la gripe tenían un 40% menos de probabilidades de desarrollar esta enfermedad neurodegenerativa.\nTambién podría interesarte: México refuerza vacunación contra sarampión y tos ferina ante el aumento de casos\nLos científicos consideran que estas vacunas podrían estar fortaleciendo el sistema inmunológico de una manera que reduce el riesgo de disfunción cerebral. Ahora, el equipo de Stanford busca realizar un ensayo clínico a gran escala para confirmar estos hallazgos y evaluar el impacto a largo plazo de la vacuna contra el herpes zóster en la prevención de la demencia.\nSigue nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nRecibe las noticias más importantes del día.

    "text": "En 27 de junio la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) conmemora el día internacional de las pymes para concienciar sobre la enorme contribución de estas empresas al desarrollo social y económico. En su día, las cámaras empresarias pymes del país se sumaron al homenaje pero lamentaron que en Argentina, bajo el actual Gobierno del presidente Milei se decidió “ignorar a nuestro sector, que vuelve a encontrarse en peligro de extinción”. Hoy es un día de reclamo, en lugar de festejo.\nLejos de avizorar algún horizonte de recuperación, el conjunto de las pymes y buena parte del entramado industrial nacional se ven crecientemente amenazados “por la política del presidente Milei, LLA y sus aliados políticos y corporativos. Por el ajuste sobre los sectores medios y más vulnerables, el consiguiente deterioro del mercado interno, la brutal caída de la actividad y las desregulaciones que imparte la política pública”, advirtieron desde la Asamblea de Pequeños y Medianos Empresarios (Apyme) en un comunicado difundido el jueves que lleva la firma de su presidente, Carlos A. Ferrari.\nEn paralelo notaron: “Mientras realizamos estas reflexiones, en la Cámara de Diputados se realiza el debate tras el cual se sancionarán la llamada Ley Bases y el Paquete Fiscal. Ningún punto de estas normativas, en cualquiera de sus versiones, contiene a las pymes, sino que termina por marginarlas en favor de un esquema de mayor concentración, extranjerización y extractivismo, sin contrapartida en aportes al valor local”. Desde Apyme hablan de evitar “otro pymicidio” y llaman a todo el empresariado nacional a unirse junto con trabajadores, cooperativas, jubilados, universidades y la ciencia para buscar alternativas nacionales que también resguarden a las instituciones democráticas.\nEn tanto desde Industriales Pymes Argentinos (IPA), afirmaron que “el sector se encuentra en una situación de crisis por la falta de lealtad comercial en las importaciones” y acusaron al secretario de Comercio, Pablo Lavigne, de cerrar las puertas a un diálogo que permita evitar la quiebra de cientos de pymes y miles de puestos de trabajo.\n“Hoy es un día de reclamo, en lugar de festejo. Hace tiempo que venimos pidiendo una reunión con Lavigne, quien evitó la reunión aduciendo problemas de agenda. Nuestro objetivo no es social, sino que busca plantear los perjuicios que genera a las fábricas nacionales, a toda la cadena de valor, pero también a la sociedad entera por las políticas de descontrol para el ingreso de importaciones, que nada tiene que ver con desregular el mercado. La falta de control de las importaciones dejó en crisis a las pymes, puso en riesgo a los trabajadores y desamparada a la población”, alertó Daniel Rosato, presidente de IPA.\nEl presidente de IPA lamentó que el secretario de Comercio “no tenga, ni siquiera, 10 minutos para atender las preocupaciones y las propuestas de las pymes” y contrapuso la predisposición que tuvo el jefe de Gabinete de Ministros, Guillermo Francos, al sostener: “no sólo recibió de antemano nuestra postura, sino que nos dedicó una hora de audiencia, entendió nuestra postura y dejó abierta una negociación para avanzar en los puntos en común”. Sin embargo el intercambio no se tradujo aún en políticas explícitas para el sector.\nEn su día, la ONU recuerda que “las microempresas y las pequeñas y medianas empresas representan el 90 por ciento de las empresas, entre el 60 y el 70 por ciento del empleo y el 50 por ciento del PIB mundial. Como columna vertebral de las sociedades de todo el mundo, contribuyen a las economías locales y nacionales y a mantener los medios de subsistencia, en particular entre los trabajadores más pobres, las mujeres, los jóvenes y otros grupos en situación de vulnerabilidad”.",

    "text": "Vitamin D is one of the most important⁤ micronutrients for our health . Maintaining adequate ⁢levels of this substance is essential for bone, cardiovascular and ⁤neurological health.‌ Because its⁢ function is mainly ‌to maintain‍ healthy bones, muscles‍ and nerves, support the immune system and help the body use a greater ​amount of calcium present ⁢in foods.\nVitamin D is fat-soluble, meaning it dissolves in fats and oils, being stored ⁣in ‌adipose tissues and the liver. It is synthesized in the skin thanks to ⁤the action of solar rays and can be ⁤obtained through food or⁤ supplements. It is an important vitamin: its deficiency⁢ can cause various complications.\nThe past November 2nd was World Vitamin D Day . ⁣We talked about its needs ‌and functions with‌ Dr. Begoña ⁣Ortiz Santodomingo, director of the Scientific Area of ​​Farmasierra.\nVitamin ‍D requires diet, yes, like others, but it’s unique because it also requires the sun to⁣ activate, right?\nFirst we need to clarify⁢ that,‌ despite its name, vitamin D is actually a hormone. The‌ human body can produce vitamin D when we are‌ exposed to the sun. This process is very important because, although it is true that we can also​ obtain vitamin D through‌ diet, with this own synthesis ‍we cover⁤ approximately 80% of our ⁣vitamin D ⁢needs.\nBut that much?‍ Does sun exposure really cover 80% ⁣of your vitamin D ‌needs?\nYes, sun exposure is the very effective method to synthesize vitamin⁤ D. Additionally, humans produce a form of⁤ vitamin D (cholecalciferol or vitamin D3) which ⁤is ⁣the⁢ most bioavailable form for​ our⁤ body.\nYet we Spaniards fail in terms‍ of vitamin‍ D. ‌The ANIBES study showed⁢ that 94% of the population⁢ aged between⁣ 10 and 75 consume less than 80% of the recommended⁤ dose The epidemiological‌ data on vitamin D ‌deficiency in Spain is ​surprising, especially considering that we live in a sunny​ country. In the Nordic countries, the⁢ population knows⁢ the ⁢importance of vitamin D, but they ​also know that they cannot rely on the sun as a source of ⁢vitamin D. Therefore, ‍it supplements the ​population ​with vitamin D, either‌ through the ⁤diet with enriched foods or​ through food supplements , thus ensuring vitamin D levels.\nBut does our ‍lifestyle help with⁣ this?\nIn Spain we⁤ rely on obtaining vitamin D through the sun‌ and do not insist on diet. But the​ reality⁤ is that our lifestyle, characterized by a sedentary lifestyle ‍and long periods of time⁢ indoors ‌(work, car,​ institutionalized elderly… etc.), ‌limits our ⁢exposure ‌to sunlight: and this is why ‌hypovitaminosis​ D data are worse than those observed⁤ in ⁤other ⁢countries. ⁤\nWho is at greater risk of⁤ suffering from vitamin D⁢ deficiency?\nPeople who expose themselves little to the sun are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. ⁢These are⁣ people who spend ‍a lot of time indoors, ⁢those who have a sedentary lifestyle, night⁤ workers, etc. The elderly are also a population at risk, as ‌with age the⁣ skin becomes​ less efficient in ⁣the production of vitamin D.‌ Furthermore, ⁢those who live ⁣in ⁣residences or long-term care ⁤centers usually have limited mobility and, therefore, less exposure ​to the sun and greater risk of deficit.\nAnd obese people…\nYes, they are risky too; even ​those with adequate sun exposure, as vitamin D ​is fatty⁤ in nature and can ‍become “trapped” in⁣ fat​ cells, ⁤decreasing available vitamin ‍D ⁤levels. Patients with chronic‍ diseases or those being treated with certain drugs (corticosteroids and anticonvulsants) ⁤that can interfere with the production or ⁤use of vitamin​ D in the body are also at risk.\nDo growing children‌ need more vitamin D? For children over one year of age, doses of ​600 IU per day of vitamin D are recommended. These needs can be met through moderate sun exposure ‌(playing outdoors)⁣ and⁣ a balanced diet that includes⁣ foods rich in vitamin D , like fatty⁤ fish.⁣ .,⁣ enriched eggs and ‌dairy products. But it is not ‍recommended to give vitamin D to children⁢ without​ doctor’s advice. ​It will always be the⁣ pediatrician who deems it​ necessary or not to supplement a child with vitamin D.\nAnd then also the children,​ right?\nChildren under 1 year old deserve special mention. ​This is a population​ with little or no exposure to ⁣the sun and ​its exclusive diet is, in many cases, breast milk which, being the⁣ best food for children, does not ⁣contain​ large quantities‍ of vitamin D.\nVitamin D has several important functions, such as supporting bone health or the immune system, but ​does it also help⁢ prevent disease? The ⁢first activity described for vitamin D‍ at the ⁤end ⁢of the 19th century, ⁣and therefore the best known, is the‌ action it‍ exerts on‍ the ​musculoskeletal‍ system, ⁢contributing ⁢to the strengthening of bones and ⁢muscles.‍ In recent years, the importance of vitamin D in the correct functioning of ‍the ⁢immune system has⁢ been​ defined, helping ⁣to reduce the ⁤risk of respiratory​ infections, autoimmune diseases and some​ types of cancer.\nWhat‍ other positive ‌effects does vitamin D have ​on the body?\nMore recentstudies⁤ also suggest that adequate levels of vitamin D help control‌ blood pressure and ‍reduce inflammation. ⁢Other studies suggest that vitamin D‍ improves insulin sensitivity,‌ which is very important in the ⁣development and evaluation of ‍diabetes.⁣ These results are very ​encouraging⁣ and​ should encourage us to take care of our ​vitamin D levels, mainly through a⁢ balanced ⁢diet, regular ⁣outdoor exercise and a healthy lifestyle.\nMany people don’t​ get enough vitamin D through sun exposure and diet. So do supplements work?\nIt ‍is true that there are segments of the population for⁣ which it is more⁣ difficult to maintain⁤ vitamin D ⁣levels: these are​ the at-risk populations we ⁤talked about earlier. In these cases, it is advisable to consult the doctor to monitor the patient’s‌ vitamin ‍D levels ⁤and, according to his ‌criteria, ⁤recommend a treatment to⁣ restore, and then maintain, ‌vitamin D⁢ levels.\nAmong these​ supplements we see that there is vitamin D2 and D3.⁤ How do they differ?\nWith both being a viable health option, vitamin D3 is usually‍ the​ choice due‍ to its greater⁣ potency and effectiveness. These two forms differ in their origin: vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) comes from foods ⁤of animal ⁣origin, while vitamin⁣ D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plant ‍sources. ⁣This is why‌ vegetarian or vegan patients⁤ usually prefer to⁤ be treated with vitamin D2 supplements.\nAnd what is better: drops, pills or ampoules?\nAll presentations have the same dose. It is the doctor ​who must recommend the dose and form​ based​ on the patient’s⁣ characteristics. ​When it comes to administering vitamin D, there are ⁤more convenient dosage forms. For example, oral solutions in children, always equipped with a reliable and accurate dosing system. In adults, solid oral forms are convenient and ensure accurate dosing. Administration ​in‌ tablets minimizes the‍ risk ​of medication errors described for liquid forms.\nSupplements for children too?\nVitamin D supplements can be very beneficial to the ​health⁢ of children, especially those who do not⁣ get enough vitamin D through ⁢diet and sun exposure. ‌However, ⁤it ⁢is⁣ essential to consult a pediatrician before starting any supplementation.\nwant to receive the best content to⁢ take care of⁢ your​ health and feel good?⁢ Sign up for⁣ our new ⁤one for free news .\nThe passage discusses the importance of vitamin D,⁣ its sources, and the ‌populations ‌at risk for deficiency. Here are some ⁣key points⁣ summarized:\nLifestyle Factors : Many ‌people have‍ sedentary lifestyles and ‌spend considerable time​ indoors, which limits their exposure to sunlight and can lead to hypovitaminosis D. This is particularly true in some‌ populations where vitamin D deficiency ‌rates are higher than in other‍ countries. At-Risk Populations : Certain groups are more ​susceptible to vitamin D deficiency: -⁤ Those ​who‍ have limited sun exposure (e.g., individuals⁤ who work ⁤indoors, night⁤ shift workers).\n⁤ – The elderly, whose skin becomes‍ less efficient⁢ at producing vitamin D as they age.\n⁤ – Individuals living in long-term care facilities, who often have restricted mobility.\n⁢ – Obese individuals,⁢ as vitamin D can get trapped in fat cells.\n‍ -​ Patients ​with chronic diseases or those taking medications (like corticosteroids) that affect vitamin D metabolism.\nChildren’s Needs : – Children over one year‍ require about 600 IU of vitamin D per day, which can be obtained through moderate sun exposure and a diet rich in vitamin D.\n– Infants under one ⁢year are at risk‍ as breast milk may not⁤ provide ⁢sufficient vitamin D.\nFunctions of Vitamin D : ⁣ – Supports bone health and muscle strength.\n– Plays a role in the immune system and may help reduce the ‍risk of ⁢respiratory infections, autoimmune diseases,⁤ and certain cancers.\n-‍ Recent studies indicate it may influence​ blood pressure ⁤regulation and improve insulin sensitivity.\nSupplementation : For those who struggle to maintain adequate vitamin ‌D levels through⁣ sunlight and diet, supplements⁢ may be recommended, especially for at-risk populations.​ It’s⁣ important to consult a healthcare⁤ provider for​ monitoring ​and recommendations. Types of Vitamin D : ‍ ⁣- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is preferred due to ⁣its potency and effectiveness; it is derived from animal sources.\n‌ ⁣ – Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plant sources and may be preferred by⁤ vegetarians or vegans.\nThese insights highlight the significance of ‍maintaining adequate vitamin D​ levels‍ for overall health and the need for increased awareness and proactive⁢ measures,‍ especially among vulnerable populations.",

    "text": "Here are 8 Japanese PC games you should be looking forward to in 2024\nWow, what a year 2023 was. We had a runaway success in dice rolling, catchy musical numbers in horror games, and—praise the sun—a brand new Armored Core to play. Beyond Armored Core, Japanese games had a strong year on PC, from Resident Evil 4 early in the year to the latest Like a Dragon near its end.\nBut that eventful time is swiftly transforming into a fading memory. Last year’s shiniest games have been all played out, backlogs have been diligently cleared (or completely ignored), and plenty of room has hopefully been made on spacious SSDs, ready to embrace all the storage-hungry big hits that are heading our way. And that’s great—it’s time to limber up for Tekken 8, slap on some winter sunscreen before Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth flies in, and catch up with Final Fantasy 14 in time for Dawntrail. But beyond these incoming headline acts there are plenty of other Japanese games worth putting on our wishlists—including these eight underdogs.\nDragon’s Dogma 2 Developer: CAPCOM Co., Ltd. | Release date: 22 Mar, 2024\nI know this feels like an obvious choice—surely nobody’s going to skip a new Capcom game—but it’s worth remembering that there’s a reason why it’s taken so long for a Dragon’s Dogma sequel to show up, and it’s got little to do with the time director Hideaki Itsuno spent dragging Devil May Cry’s reputation out of the mud. To be blunt: as good as it was, nobody bought the incredible fantasy RPG that thought nothing of mixing potential shopkeeper romances with hardcore speedrunning modes and epic fights against gigantic climbable bosses. According to Capcom’s own sales reports, Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen was outsold by two different SNES ports of Street Fighter 2 and a PSP Monster Hunter game that never left Japan, even though it was easily one of the best games of its generation.\nAll signs point to this sequel being just as much of a masterwork, so Capcom can’t go wrong—unless nobody buys it, again.\nEiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes Developer: Rabbit and Bear Studios | Release date: 23 Apr, 2024\nThe well loved yet rarely affordable RPG series Suikoden’s back—only this time it’s not by Konami, or called Suikoden. But in spite of all the obvious changes, much in Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is going to look instantly familiar to anyone fond of the good old PS1 RPG days of vampires, squirrel squads, minigames, and fascinating regional power struggles.\nWhether it really can rebottle PlayStation-era lightning remains to be seen, but between Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising’s positive reception, the inclusion of several of the ’90s classic’s key staff members, and the impressive screenshots shown on the Hundred Heroes’s website, it looks like it’s in with a good chance.\nPenny Blood: Hellbound Developer: NatsumeAtari, STUDIO WILDROSE | Release date: Q3 2024\nEvery crowdfunded indie project these days has to offer its backers an even more indie spinoff game to idle away the long months/years between handing over their money and the final release of whatever they were hoping to play, and this one belongs to Penny Blood, a game that will eventually be a spiritual sequel to cult classic PlayStation 2 RPG series Shadow Hearts. Hellbound promises to be an intense action-roguelike with added, um, bloodsurfing, apparently, delivered via an eye-catching art style that mixes the cute with the macabre. It should be an intriguing teaser before the main event, and both of these games can’t come soon enough for my liking.\nR-Type Tactics I • II Cosmos Developer: Granzella Inc. | Release date: ??? [Steam page still says 2023]\nCommon sense tells us that R-Type, the classic arcade shmup, shouldn’t work when reimagined as a turn based strategy game, yet Cosmos easily proves that the series its in its element when its interplanetary shootouts are stuffed with stats and take place on busy hex grids.\nThis extensive graphical overhaul of the brilliant PSP originals (the latter of which was previously never released outside Japan) was due out last summer, only to be sadly delayed. It doesn’t matter too much. Even if they’re “only” as good as they used to be when we do finally get to play them on our PCs, the quietly unsettling Cosmos will still instantly become one of the best tactical games of 2024.\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak Developer: Nihon Falcom, PH3 GmbH | Release date: Summer 2024 [Steam page lists initial non-English release date]\nAs the 11th game in a series that began years ago with Trails in the Sky, it’d be easy to assume there’s an air of “Been there, done that” hanging over Trails Through Daybreak, that anyone who cares already knows exactly who’s in it and how it’s going to play.\nThat assumption would be wrong. Daybreak is the beginning of another fresh story within an ongoing saga, bringing with it new faces, places, and all sorts of ways to hit all sorts of enemies really, really, hard. It’s due out in English this summer—that might be enough time to catch up on the others, if you’re quick.\nUnder Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes Developer: FRENCH-BREAD, Arc System Works | Release date: 24 Jan, 2024\n“Sys:Celes sinks towards ruination.\nFor the Immortalize, the collapse of all that is, looms on the horizon.\nThe curtain rises on the final chapter of the Hollow Night. Catastrophe beckons…”\nI may not understand Under Night’s plot, but I do know that this 2D fighter is going to be pretty, it’s going to be intense, and within 10 seconds of online play I’m sure it’s going to make me feel like I should never challenge another human being to a virtual fight again. However much I lose, with 24 characters to choose from and rollback netcode, I’m sure this is going to be a lot of fun.\nBlade Chimera Developer: Team Ladybug, WSS playground | Release date: 2024\nThere’s no escaping indie Metroidvanias, although this one manages to stand out from the crowd thanks to luscious pixel art, an unusual sci-fi ‘n’ sorcery theme, and its developers short but impressive track record. Blade Chimera’s the latest game from Team Ladybug, who previously worked on Record of Lodoss War-Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth- and Touhou Luna Nights. Both of their previous games took the Symphony of the Night-like genre in interesting new directions, so I’d be surprised if this didn’t continue that welcome trend.\n∀stralbringer -Shaded Arkarium- Developer: Endless Shirafu | Release date: February 2024\nThis one just launched on January 2, but only in Japanese—English support is expected to arrive in February or March. A quick dip into the almost untypeable ∀stralbringer’s playable demo throws more bullets on screen at once than some shmups do in entire runs, and the default KB+M control method doesn’t exactly help with survival. This isn’t in any danger of being the most welcoming shmup to casually try out—the demo’s lengthy Japanese language tutorial is required reading, and the weapon/shield systems take some getting used to—but it’s definitely a memorable one, and it feels like something of a breath of fresh air in one of gaming’s oldest genres.",
