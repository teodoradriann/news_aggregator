    "title": "Vendors of cancelled Abbotsford craft market still fighting for refunds - The Abbotsford News",
    "text": "The organizer of a cancelled Christmas craft market in Abbotsford still has not responded to vendors’ requests for thousands of dollars in refunds or an explanation about why she has ignored them. But the Abbotsford Police Department (APD) has indicated the matter is not likely to be pursued criminally. The Abbotsford News first reported at the end of November that several vendors had spoken out after not receiving refunds for table rentals at the Krafted Handmade Christmas Market. The event, organized by Ange Eely of West Kelowna, had been scheduled to run Nov. 30 to Dec. 3 at the Ag-Rec Building at Abbotsford Exhibition Park. The city has indicated that Eely paid the full amount to book the building – a total of $12,408 for the four-day market – plus a $500 security deposit, but did not cancel the event or request a refund. RELATED: [Vendors at cancelled Abbotsford craft market say organizer has ‘ghosted’ them](https://www.abbynews.com/news/vendors-at-cancelled-abbotsford-craft-market-say-organizer-has-ghosted-them-7114752) The market had been advertised mainly on Facebook, with application forms available on the Krafted Canada website. It was estimated that 130 vendors had signed up, with some paying as much as $1,000 for the space. A post on an artisan-related Facebook page on Nov. 6 from a friend of Eely’s indicated the event was being cancelled due to her requiring “emergency surgery.” Another post indicated that an email would be sent out when Eely was recovered, and she would offer vendors a choice of a refund or a move to another Krafted Canada market in 2024. Within days of those posts, the Krafted Canada website was taken down, as was Eely’s private Facebook page. Emails to Eely bounced back, phone calls were not answered and private messages were not returned. The Abbotsford News also attempted to contact Eely at four email addresses – two of which bounced back – and by text message and through a friend. As of Thursday, Dec. 28, neither The Abbotsford News nor the vendors had heard from Eely. The vendors’ frustration led to the formation of a Facebook group to discuss options for receiving their refunds. Some said they have had the charges reversed on their credit cards – although it took time to occur – but others, including those who paid by e-transfer, haven’t been as successful. APD media officer Const. Art Stele said police have received at least one report about Eely and are aware of the situation, but a fraud investigation is not likely. “It would be dependent on the evidence from the various parties and, at this stage, it’s not likely to be pursued criminally,” he said. Stele recommended that those impacted take action through the Civil Resolution Tribunal, through which parties can resolve disputes under $5,000. The process is conducted entirely online and doesn’t require lawyers, he said.",

    "title": "Use Your Tongue to Control a Cursor: See the 'MouthPad' in Action",
    "text": "Using your tongue to control a computer mouse is certainly unconventional. But a San Francisco startup is developing the concept to help people with physical disabilities access today’s PCs and mobile devices.\nOn Friday, Augmental gave its first public demo of the unique mouse, which is called the MouthPad. The Bluetooth device essentially functions as a trackpad built into a mouth piece.\nIn the demo, Augmental software engineer Corbin Halliwill places the device against the roof of his mouth. He then uses his tongue like a finger on a trackpad, which allows him to remotely control a cursor on his iPhone, make clicks, and navigate to Google Maps, hands-free.\nBy using the MouthPad, Halliwill is also able to access the iPhone’s virtual keyboard and begin typing. He then searches for a nearby grocery store in Google Maps .\nAugmental initially debuted the concept in April with a separate video that showed the MouthPad has the potential to help people suffering from quadriplegia access their devices. Although many consumer electronics offer voice commands, it can still be hard to work efficiently on a computer without a way to interface with a traditional mouse and keyboard.\nThe MouthPad aims to fill the gap. The device can run for 5 hours on a single charge, and supports iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nOne challenge will be making the MouthPad fit different mouth shapes. For now, the company has been creating custom molds for customers by mailing them a kit designed to take their dental impressions. \"With your dental scan, we'll manufacture your custom MouthPad, ensuring maximum comfort and reduced weight,” the company said in a FAQ .\nAugmental plans on showing the MouthPad during next week’s CES in Las Vegas. The company’s website has also opened a waitlist for users interested in ordering a unit, although pricing isn't mentioned.",

    "text": "A missing World War II soldier from Ridgway was accounted for on Sept. 21, 2023, 78 years after his death in France. U.S. Army Private James B. McCartney, 22, was assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 222nd Infantry Regiment, 42nd Infantry Division in early 1945, according to a Thursday release from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. On March 1 of that year, McCartney was killed in action while his unit patrolled near Wildenguth, France. His remains were not immediately recovered and the Germans did not report McCartney as a prisoner of war. The American Graves Registration Command, the organization that searched for and recovered fallen American personnel in the European Theater, searched the area beginning in 1947 and did not locate McCartney’s remains. He was declared nonrecoverable on Oct. 8, 1951. DPAA historians who are conducting research into soldiers missing from combat near Wildenguth found that X-6492, a body buried in the Lorraine American Cemetery, an American Battle Monuments Commission site in St. Avold, France, could be connected to McCartney. In August 2022, the DPAA disinterred and transferred X-6492 to a laboratory for analysis. Scientists from DPAA and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used dental and anthropological analysis, as well as mitochondrial DNA and autosomal DNA analysis, to identify McCartney’s remains. McCartney’s name is on the Walls of the Missing at Epinal American Cemetry in Dinozé, France. To indicate he has been accounted for, a rosette will be placed next to his name. McCartney will be buried March 30, 2024, in Bakersfield, California. Get more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.",

    "text": "SIESTA KEY, Florida (Reuters) - Chris Fiore was supposed to be accepting delivery of new household appliances and furniture, replacing items that were swamped by Hurricane Helene just a few weeks ago.\nInstead, the resident of Siesta Key, the Florida barrier island town where Hurricane Milton made landfall this week, was using a broom to push muck and seawater out of her ground-floor condo, a dream home she purchased just four years ago.\n\"There is no chance I'm pulling up stakes,\" Fiore said on Friday, pointing out the waterline where ocean water earlier this week was two feet (60 cm) up a wall. \"I'm doubling down, thinking about hurricane windows and doors, figuring out how to stop this water from coming in.\"\nThis sentiment was echoed by several residents of Siesta Key who spoke with Reuters on Friday. Residents were outnumbered by clean-up workers and people handing out cards advertising roofing and other construction services following two major hurricanes in two weeks.\nAll were feeling down from the double whammy of Helene and Milton. But no one seemed defeated, despite the threats of more and stronger hurricanes coming their way in the future.\n\"Paradise is still paradise, despite this mess,\" said Pat Hurst, who along with her husband Bill has lived on Siesta Key since 2011 and has been visiting for well over two decades.\n\"That said, cleaning up from one hurricane while trying to prepare for another was really stressful.\"\nWhile those living outside hurricane-prone zones may wonder why their residents choose to stay, it is easy to see Siesta Key's appeal, even after a hurricane. The place is a Jimmy Buffet song come to life. The mix of low-slung homes and three-story condos are painted in pleasant pastels, and downtown is lined with appealing restaurants and bars.\nAfter Milton, fine white beach sand covered roads several blocks inland. Homes were turned inside out, with every imaginable household possession ruined by Helene heaped along roads. Coconuts were blown from trees and thrown asunder.\nBoats normally docked in canals were tossed on land. Dumpsters already full from the Helene cleanup were being topped by Milton's debris.\nMilton, the fifth-most-intense Atlantic hurricane on record, intensified quickly from a Category 1 storm to the maximum Category 5 at sea in less than 24 hours, the latest example of a worrying trend that has seen storms growing more powerful, more quickly, due to climate change.\nMilton made landfall as a Category 3. At least 16 deaths were attributed to Milton, CBS News cited the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as saying.\nAsked by reporters about possible discussion of not letting people rebuild, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said on Friday that \"the reality is people work their whole lives to be able to live in environments that are really, really nice, and they have a right to make those decisions with their property as they see fit.\n\"It is not the role of government to forbid them or to force them to dispose or utilize their property in a way that they do not think is best for them,\" DeSantis said.\nSherry Tom, 49, convinced her husband and three daughters to leave Pittsburgh's cold winters and move to Siesta Key in 2021.\n\"This place is my whole heart,\" she said. \"But I will admit - I'm worried about living in fear that this will happen again. But if we can, we're staying.\"\nTom said she thinks that they will have to knock down what remains of their home and build from scratch. She wasn't certain how they will get that done, but was resolute about staying.\nMarko Radosavljevic, 54, owns one of the original homes built by Siesta Key's first developer, Frank Archibald. It's a coral green beauty built with pecky cypress wood, known for its water resistance. Water and wind have nonetheless done damage in the past two weeks.\nAs he worked to clean out debris from the house he's owned since 2017, Radosavljevic said that he was not even considering leaving behind a place \"with a special island vibe.\"\n\"I refuse to be pushed out,\" Radosavljevic said, referring to both storms and drives to put up hotels in place of the older homes like his.\n(Reporting by Brad Brooks; editing by Donna Bryson and Sandra Maler)\nBy Brad Brooks\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "title": "Britain to create EV battery material to power faster charging and longer range",
    "text": "Behnam Hormozi, founder of Integrals Power, says he plans to scale up the Milton Keynes factory - David Hartley A new generation of electric car batteries using materials made in Britain could extend the number of miles vehicles can travel after one charge. Integrals Power, which is based in Milton Keynes, is vying to supply gigafactories with a breakthrough material that it says will make batteries more powerful and last longer. This week, the company opened the UK’s only factory capable of producing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode powder, where it plans to produce small amounts before scaling up. The cathode is the material used for the positive electrode, determining the voltage and capacity of a lithium-ion battery. So-called range anxiety is often named as one of the biggest factors preventing drivers from switching from a car with a standard combustion engine to an electric model. A lack of charging points across the UK means cars with greater battery range enable drivers to make longer, cross-country, journeys. Behnam Hormozi, founder and chief executive of Integrals Power, said: “The cathode is the most critical part of the cell because it determines the battery’s overall performance, cost and durability. “That’s why our breakthroughs in cathode active material will enable electric vehicles to achieve longer range, faster charging and higher performance from smaller, lighter battery packs. “We also source our raw materials from Europe and the US, so we can help cell suppliers and vehicle manufacturers to develop a more robust, transparent supply chain that mitigates geopolitical issues.” It comes as Western governments are trying to reduce their chronic dependence on China, where 90pc of battery cathode material and 100pc of LFP materials are currently made. Rishi Sunak’s government previously set out plans to “onshore” some of this production, partly via relief on electricity costs, amid fears Beijing could threaten supplies during a geopolitical crisis. The company’s factory will initially produce 20 tons per year of cathode material, before scaling up to 1,000 tons over the next two years after securing its first orders, Mr Hormozi said. However, he said the modular production methods being used meant that it could in theory scale up to 100,000 tons, depending on demand. A big chunk of that is likely to come from Europe-based companies that will soon be forced to source at least 70pc of the materials for electric car batteries either in the UK or on the Continent. Under the post-Brexit “rules of origin” regime, these requirements will come into force in 2027. “That is definitely a great advantage to have over the next few years,” Mr Hormozi said. Several different chemical compositions are currently used for batteries that power electric cars, with some primarily powered by lithium and others by nickel, for example. But LFP batteries are seen as the “rising star” of the industry, accounting for 40pc of electric car demand last year, according to the International Energy Agency. That market share has more than doubled since 2020. Global battery production is dominated by China, which also controls the lion’s share of critical mineral refining as well. In recent years, the US, EU and UK have all set out strategies to reduce – albeit not eliminate – their dependence on Beijing. On top of electric cars, Mr Hormozi said the cathode material developed by Integrals Power also had applications in other areas, such as power tools.

    "text": "California American Water is proud to announce the completion of the Cottage Way Well Project, a critical investment that helps ensure a safe, reliable water supply for the Arden-Arcade community within the greater Sacramento region.\nThe $3.3 million project, part of the company’s larger Regional Well Installation and Replacement Program, included the construction of a newly drilled well, waterline installation, driveway and sidewalk restoration, roadway improvements, and landscaping.\n“The Cottage Way Well is an example of our commitment to providing customers with high-quality drinking water,” said Steve Dutch, Northern Division Engineering Manager at California American Water. “By proactively investing in infrastructure upgrades, we help minimize the impacts of water shortages or pressure fluctuations during peak usage times.”\nThe Cottage Way Well was built to replace an aging well, over 60 years old, that was taken out of service. The new well meets and surpasses all drinking water quality standards.\n“Older wells become less efficient over time,” continued Dutch. “New wells are built to meet current standards and have longer lifespans, which means a more sustainable water system for the future, fewer maintenance costs, and better water conservation. Our operations team has installed a Variable Frequency Drive at the Cottage Well site, so the flow rate can change based on demand needs automatically, saving water and energy.”\nThe Cottage Way Well project exemplifies California American Water’s continued commitment to preemptively addressing aging infrastructure. Several wells in the Sacramento area are nearing or have already exceeded their designed 60-year lifespan. California American Water will continue to invest in critical upgrades throughout the region, to help ensure customers have high-quality water for decades to come.\nAbout American Water\nAmerican Water (NYSE: AWK) is the largest regulated water and wastewater utility company in the United States.

    "text": "EUROPA LEAGUE La Roma finiquita al Milan y avanza a las semifinales Por Héctor Cantú El equipo de La Loba completó la tarea para llegar a la antesala por el título El equipo de la [Roma](https://www.foxdeportes.com/serie-a/galeria/roma-termino-con-mala-racha-en-el-derbi-y-va-por-bolonia-en-la-serie-a) completó la tarea en la Europa League y avanzó a las semifinales del torneo de clubes luego de imponerse 2-0 al Milan en el juego de vuelta. La Loba sacó provecho del resultado obtenido en el juego de ida y, para este partido, aprovechando la localía sentenció a su favor la eliminatoria. Al equipo romano le bastaron 10 minutos para sentenciar la suerte de su compañero de liga mismo que pagó caro los errores consumados en los primeros 90 minutos de la eliminatoria en los que no pudieron hacerse presentes en el marcador. Ahora, obligados a buscar un gol que al menos les permitiera empatar el marcador global, generaron espacios que no le fueron perdonados y sí capitalizados por la escuadra comandada por Daniele de Rossi. El primero en aparecer fue Gianluca Mancini a los 12 minutos de tiempo corrido. El anotador del gol de la diferencia en la ida reapareció de nueva cuenta para aprovechar un balón estrellado en el poste para mandarlo al [fondo de las redes.](https://www.foxdeportes.com/serie-a/nota/la-roma-despide-a-jose-mourinho-y-da-la-bienvenida-a-daniele-de-rossi/) El golpe fue casi demoledor para el Milan que no supo reaccionar inmediatamente. Paulo Dybala entonces sacó un zapatazo que imposiblitó al arquero rival para detener la trayectoria de la pelota al fondo de las redes. Aunque ahora no se hizo presente en el marcador, la labor de Romeu Lukaku fue fundamental para el equipo local que sueña con volver a levantar la Europa League. A cinco minutos del final, el Milan recortó distancias con el tanto de Matteo Gabbia, que por lo tardío de la anotación, hizo imposible la remontada del equipo visitante. Con este resultado, [la Roma](https://www.foxdeportes.com/serie-a/nota/daniele-de-rossi-debuto-con-triunfo-al-frente-de-la-roma-en-serie-a) se enfrentará en las semifinales al Bayer Leverkusen que mantiene su racha invicta de 44 partidos tras empatar ante el West Ham United.",
