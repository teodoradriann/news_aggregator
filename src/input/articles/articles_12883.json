    "text": "¿Por qué no deberías instalar 'identificadores de llamada' en tu teléfono? Esto es lo que no te dicen\nLos identificadores de llamada se han vuelto muy populares, ya que ayudan a evitar las molestas llamadas SPAM. Sin embargo, pocos saben cómo nutren su base de datos.\nEn la actualidad, miles de personas son víctimas de las molestas llamadas SPAM o 'fantasmas', las cuáles se caracterizan porque nos cuelgan apenas contestamos. Aunque la mayoría piensa que estas comunicaciones son hechas por delincuentes, [lo cierto es que muchas de ellas son realizadas por trabajadores de 'call centers](https://larepublica.pe/tecnologia/smartphone/2024/11/16/mejor-que-magis-tv-esta-plataforma-ofrece-350-canales-gratis-para-tu-smart-tv-y-telefono-xumo-1145184)' que buscan ofrecerte algún producto o servicio.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Supera a Magis TV: esta plataforma tiene 350 canales gratis para ver en tu Smart TV o celular]\nMuchos 'call centers' utilizan un software especial que (durante una jornada laboral) realiza llamadas automáticas a cientos de personas. Si tu contestas y hay un trabajador disponible, este comenzará a hablarte para venderte algo. No obstante, puede darse el caso de que respondas y todos los empleados estén ocupados. En estos casos, la comunicación se cortará.\n¿Qué son los identificadores de llamada?\nEstas llamadas indeseadas han provocado que se incremente la popularidad de los 'identificadores de llamadas'. Estas apps permiten saber si una persona real está tratando de comunicarse con nosotros o se trata de una compañía que busca venderte algo. Asimismo, muchas de esas aplicaciones son capaces de bloquear números con muchas denuncias de SPAM.\nEn Play Store y App Store, las tiendas oficiales de Google y Apple, respectivamente, hay varios 'identificadores de llamada', siendo TrueCaller, GetContact y CallApp los más populares, debido a su gran número de usuarios y por los beneficios que ofrece. Entre ellos, darte el nombre de la persona que te está llamando. De esta manera, podrás decidir contestar o no.\nUtilizar estos identificadores de llamada es bastante sencillo, simplemente descargamos la aplicación, brindamos unos cuantos permisos y eso sería todo. No solo podremos saber quién nos está llamando, [también es posible bloquear llamadas entrantes realizadas desde números del extranjero](https://larepublica.pe/tecnologia/smartphone/2024/11/20/tienes-un-smart-tv-asi-podras-ver-videos-de-youtube-sin-anuncios-y-gratis-en-tu-televisor-1350720), los cuáles son usados para estafar a la gente.\nPUEDES VER:\n[¿Tienes un Smart TV? Hay un truco para ver videos de YouTube sin anuncios y gratis en tu televisor]\n¿Por qué no es recomendable instalarlos en tu teléfono?\nA simple vista, los identificadores de llamada parecen una buena herramienta que nos permiten estar protegidos contra las molestas llamadas SPAM; sin embargo, pocos han notado que estas aplicaciones utilizan nuestra información personal para nutrir su base de datos. Es decir, los datos de las personas son usados por estas compañías y no lo saben.\nPor ejemplo, cuando instalas TrueCaller (u otra aplicación similar), te pedirán acceder a tu lista de contactos, de lo contrario, no podrás usarla. Al aceptar estas condiciones, estarás brindándole los números (y nombres) de tu papá, mamá, hermanos, amistades, entre otros contactos, a una compañía que ya tenido filtraciones en el pasado.\nSegún detalla Pacoweb, un especialista en temas de ciberseguridad, la empresa True Software Scandinavia AB (creadores de TrueCaller) en 2018 fue víctima de un hackeo que provocó que millones de números telefónicos fueran filtrados. Esta información acabó llegando al mercado negro, donde hay muchas personas interesadas en comprar bases de datos.\nPor ese motivo, no es recomendable instalar los identificadores de llamadas en tu teléfono inteligente. Puede que sirvan para detectar estas llamadas SPAM, pero a cambio estarás brindando números y nombres de otras personas sin su autorización. En caso quieras darte de baja en alguna de estas apps, debes saber que TrueCaller tiene una opción para hacerlo. Solo debes ingresar a [este ](https://www.truecaller.com/unlisting)enlace.",

    "title": "Reviving the Ulster American Folk Park Bog: A Community-Driven Conservation Success Story",
    "text": "On a brisk morning at the Ulster American Folk Park, a group of dedicated volunteers donned their boots and gloves, ready to delve into the heart of conservation. Their mission was clear: to restore the vitality of the last remaining plot of raised bog, a precious ecosystem teeming with Irish bog mosses and lichen. This initiative, a beacon of hope in the fight against climate change, aims not only to revive the unique biodiversity of the area but also to transform this patch of land into a formidable carbon sink.\nThe Power of Community in Peatland Conservation\nThe restoration project at the Ulster American Folk Park is a testament to the power of community and volunteerism in the face of environmental challenges. Volunteers, arm in arm with conservation experts, are tirelessly working to remove invasive species, such as Rhododendron, that threaten the delicate balance of the bog ecosystem. These efforts are crucial in preventing the bog from drying out, thereby allowing native species to flourish once again. The project stands as a shining example of how collective action can lead to significant environmental benefits, promoting sustainability and resilience.\nBreathing Life Back into Biodiversity\nThe impact of the restoration work is already visible, with an increase in biodiversity that breathes new life into the park. New species of lichens and birds, once absent from this landscape, are now making their presence known, signaling a successful revival of the bog's ecosystem. Such positive changes underscore the importance of conserving habitats for the overall health of our planet. The project not only focuses on the present but also sows the seeds for a greener, more vibrant future.\nCorporate Support Fuels Conservation Efforts\nBehind the scenes, Hughes Insurance has emerged as a pivotal supporter of the peatland restoration project, integrating it into their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy. This collaboration highlights the crucial role that corporate entities can play in advancing environmental conservation efforts. Hughes Insurance's involvement provides not only financial support but also raises awareness about the importance of protecting such unique ecosystems for future generations.\nIn the shadow of climate change, the restoration of the Ulster American Folk Park's bog is a beacon of hope and a model for conservation efforts worldwide. Thanks to the dedication of volunteers and the support of entities like Hughes Insurance, this project is making significant strides in promoting biodiversity and carbon sequestration. The revival of Irish bog mosses and lichen at the park is a testament to what can be achieved when community and corporate worlds collide in the name of environmental sustainability. As we move forward, the lessons learned and the successes achieved here will undoubtedly inspire further conservation initiatives, proving that every effort counts in the quest to protect our planet.",

    "text": "Minnesota minimum wage set to increase Monday\nFor those making minimum wage in Minnesota, the new year will come with a raise. The data is not in for 2023 yet, but in 2022, the estimated number of Minnesota jobs paying at or below the minimum wage was around 90,000, or 2.7% of salaried and hourly jobs.\nStarting January 1, the minimum wage will go from\n$10.59 to $10.85 an hour for employees of large employers.\nFor employees that work for small employers (those who make under $500,000 a year), the minimum wage will go from $8.63 to $8.85. This\nrate also applies for youth under 18 and employees younger than 20 in their first 90 days of employment.\nThe state minimum wage has been increased each year for inflation since 2018 due to a law passed in 2014. The Minnesota minimum wages are adjusted for inflation annually using the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures produced by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n“Minimum wage earners are typically workers in the hospitality industry or other service industries,” said Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry Spokesman James Honerman. “This annual minimum wage adjustment was set in place by the Minnesota state legislature to give minimum wage workers in Minnesota more earning power as they work hard to support themselves and their families.”\nThe amount the minimum wage increases each year is decided in August and then goes into effect the following January 1. By state law, the inflation adjustment must not exceed 2.5%, and it cannot be a decrease.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index is a commonly used measure of inflation. The latest update is that\nprices increased 3.1% from November 2022 to November 2023.\n“When we think about inflation adjustment, the cost of things are going up over time,” said Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry Director of Research Nichole Sorenson. “With the minimum wage, how it’s determined to be increased by our legislature is that it increases with inflation. But there’s a cap, so we can only increase it up to two and a half percent each year, according to the legislation. With high inflation like we’ve had in the last couple of years, the minimum wage isn’t keeping up with inflation.”\nThe Department of Labor and Industry is able to analyze today’s wage and compare it to prior years, releasing the data in the\nyearly minimum wage report.\n“For 2023, the large employer minimum wage is set to $10.59 an hour. If we compare that to the federal minimum wage that was in place from 1960 to 1981, and then adjust that number for inflation into today’s 2023 dollar, that would be $12.03,” explained Sorenson. “So if you’re thinking about the federal minimum wage from the sixties to the early eighties, that would actually be a higher take home rate than what the minimum wage in Minnesota is for a large employer today.”\nPer Minnesota’s employee notice requirement, employers are required to provide each employee with written notice of any change before it goes into effect. This includes a change in the employee’s rate of pay.\nThe state minimum wage rates will not apply to work performed in the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul since the Twin Cities have higher minimum wage rates.\nWisconsin is among 20 states that still go by the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 since 2009.",

    "title": "Decades Of Government-Fueled Airline Consolidation And Policy Failures: Now They’re Scrambling To Investigate The Wide-Ranging Crisis",
    "text": "The U.S. Departments of Justice and Transportation [have launched a wide-ranging probe of consolidation and anti-competitive conduct](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-department-transportation-launch-broad-public-inquiry-state) in air travel. What they will come to learn is that the federal government has fostered consolidation, and has made it nearly impossible to have competition in aviation as a matter of policy for decades. A [Request for Information has been issued](https://www.regulations.gov/document/ATR-2024-0001-0001) by the DOJ Antitrust Division and the Department of Transportation on issues related to market consolidation, anticompetitive practices, and the overall state of competition in sectors impacting air transportation, such as airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturing, and air transportation sales channels, looking to asses how a lack of competition affects consumers, workers, and the overall economy. Specific areas of interest include airline mergers, fare structures, airline rewards programs, airport access, aircraft manufacturing, labor markets, and the impact of federal actions on competition. The agencies are particularly interested in potential antitrust violations such as price-fixing, market allocation, and exclusionary practices. Comments are due December 23, 2024. The Federal Government Has Consolidated The Airline Industry The federal government signed off on mergers of United Airlines and Continental; Delta Air Lines and Northwest; American Airlines and US Airways; Southwest Airlines and AirTran to name just a few. Yet they recently fought to stop JetBlue from acquiring Spirit Airlines as though that would stifle competition in the industry, and now Spirit finds itself on the brink of bankruptcy. The government has also signed off on antitrust-immunized joint ventures between U.S. airlines and foreign carriers. For instance, - American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia, Finnair and Aer Lingus all coordinate schedules, prices and share revenue. - American and Japan Airlines and also American and Qantas have anti-trust immunity to work together. - Delta Air Lines and Korean Air; Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico; and Delta Air Lines and Air France KLM as well as Virgin Atlantic cooperate. - United Airlines, Air Canada, and Lufthansa act as one across the Atlantic, United and ANA have a joint venture across the Pacific and United and Air Canada divvy up the transborder merket. Yet somehow they’re shocked, shocked (!) to find out there’s gambling going on here. Joint ventures are a substitute for mergers which are generally prohibited between U.S. and foreign carriers. But in an environment where government blocks new market entrants, fostering a winnowing of existing players is highly problematic. Barriers To Competition Are Largely The Result Of Government Policies Unlike much of the world, in the United States airports are mostly owned by the government. While it’s not considered a best practice for a regulatory agency to also be a service provide (since that means the agency regulates itself), the TSA both regulates and carries out most airport security and the FAA’s air traffic organization but regulates and performs air traffic control duties. Airport slots are handed out by the federal government as property rights to incumbent airlines, keeping out competition from new entrants into the market (congestion pricing for takeoff and landing fees would be a better solution than slots, and there’s no reason to gift these valuable assets as a subsidy in any case). Even where slot controls aren’t an issue, gates at congested airports are. Federal legislation eliminated 12 out of 32 gates at Dallas Love Field, so that Southwest wound up in control of 90% of them. Meanwhile, when airlines want to serve Atlanta in competition with Delta, they have a hard time getting usable gates. JetBlue initially found themselves with use of gates on different concourses for each of its flights when they began service there. Foreign ownership of U.S. airlines is restricted, and foreign carriers aren’t allowed to carry passengers between any two points in the U.S. (and that includes Guam, even). Ryanair and Singapore Airlines aren’t allowed to compete here. The Problem Isn’t The Number Of Competitors, It’s Homogenization The problem in the airline industry isn’t so much price (which has been on a long-term downward trend, inclusive of fees). It’s lack of product choice and product differentiation. And this is only likely to get worse. The crackdown on part 135 carriers that American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and pilot union ALPA are pushing for [will make small city air service using new technology electric planes impossible](https://viewfromthewing.com/hidden-danger-imminent-government-crackdown-on-jsx-will-devastate-rural-air-service-and-kill-electric-aircraft-innovation/), cutting off innovation before it even starts. The FAA [says it plans to move forward with the crackdown on small competitors](https://viewfromthewing.com/big-airline-lobbyists-win-faa-will-move-forward-with-crackdown-on-comfortable-scheduled-charters-like-jsx/) despite the harm this will do to innovation and competition. When government protects incumbents, there’s little need to innovate. And when government closely manages the end-to-end experience of air travel, there’s little room to innovate. For instance, - Earlier this year [United had to ground a fleet of planes because of an outdated no smoking sign rule](https://viewfromthewing.com/united-airlines-just-grounded-a-fleet-of-planes-because-its-no-smoking-signs-dont-turn-off/). The FAA requires cabin crew to be able to turn no smoking signs off and on. They no longer need to turn them off, so they’re no longer made to turn off. United forgot to ask for the standard exemption to this rule. But the cabin experience is that micro-managed. - American had to ask for government permission to put doors on their next generation business class seats – like JetBlue, Delta, and many foreign carriers have. The government [initially refused to consider the request](https://viewfromthewing.com/faa-refuses-to-consider-americans-request-to-put-doors-on-business-class-seats/)because it was made on letterhead that didn’t include the airline’s address or fax number. - Early in the pandemic when American Airlines wanted to give out hand sanitizer to passengers [they needed sign off from two different FAA offices](https://viewfromthewing.com/airlines-cant-just-give-out-hand-sanitizer-the-process-they-have-to-go-through-for-permission/)even though passengers themselves were already allowed to bring on board sanitizer and even though FAA had already determined this was not a hazard. Governments own the airports, perform the security screening function, and provide air traffic control. They sign off on every detail of the passenger cabin. Planes are at the control of government from the time they push back to when they arrive at their next gate. And the entire selling and customer service experience is directly regulated by their own dedicated government agency. And they wonder why the airline business seems… uncompetitive? Within A Narrow Range, Airlines Are Quite Competitive There’s economically significant competition between most U.S. cities with air service. American, United, Delta, and Southwest are all significant players, and Alaska, JetBlue, Spirit and Frontier provide augmented service as well. The notion that there aren’t different airlines to buy from is odd. And mergers often did improve this connectivity, for instance the Delta-Northwest merger improved travel between the Southeast and Upper Midwest. Airfares are certainly lower than they were in the regulated era. More people have access to travel than they did 25 years ago and 50 years ago, by a lot. Yet Incumbents Are Subsidized And Protected Well over $100 billion in subsidies for U.S. airlines had been spent long before the pandemic. For instance, the very first big aircraft order American Airlines ever made was underwritten by the Roosevelt administration. American’s CEO had been best man in FDR’s son’s wedding. The federal government has relieved several airlines of their pension obligations – including from US Airways, Delta, and United. In the past four years the federal government handed $79 billion in direct taxpayer cash to U.S. airlines as well. But perhaps more importantly, the government protects airlines from lawsuit. The Airline Deregulation Act pre-empts state rules including, generally, common law contract claims like any duty of good faith and fair dealing. Any suit that touches on airline schedules or pricing can only look at whether an airline violates its own contracts, and not common law obligations. So What Should We Do? If we care about competition, railing against the airlines isn’t the answer. We need to look at the policies that give us the outcomes that we have. Just like if we hate bag fees, railing about those is strange without looking at the 7.5% excise tax on domestic airfares that encourages airlines to charge them – because money taken out of the fare and put into fees is a tax arbitrage worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year to the industry. We should legalize competition. Allow foreign ownership of airlines operating in the U.S. Let both Ryanair and Singapore Airlines operate here! Eliminate slot restrictions and replace those with congestion pricing, to allow airlines that would derive the greatest value for consumers from a flight to operate it. That would have the added environmental benefit of eliminating the need for slot squatting – flights to nowhere just to meet usage requirements. A pro-competition policy would look to expand air traffic control capacity, modernizing the way that NavCanada has, to support more flights which would have the benefit of cheaper air service as well by making increased supply possible. And it wouldn’t allow big corporate interests to block competitors by raising their costs and banning their business models, as American and Southwest have proposed in cracking down on Part 135 carriers. We should demand differentiated airline products but first recognize that we have to legalize differentiated products. We need to stop government agencies like airport authorities from blocking competition. We need to unleash the market from control by the big incumbent players who influence government policymaking and entrench the status quo, before we begin to look at whether increased control in the industry makes any sense.",
