That clash, if strong and persistent enough, can produce the Northern Lights, a dancing display of brilliant reds, greens, and purples in the northern nighttime sky.\nFor it to be seen in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, we do need an especially strong storm, and for just the right interaction at the top of the atmosphere. The planetary \"k-index\" is used to measure the strength of the geomagnetic storm, and as of Thursday evening, the k-index was around an 8.\nFor the aurora to be visible here, we generally need a k-index value of at least a 7, with an 8 or a 9 more favorable for more widespread and colorful Northern Lights displays.\nIn order to view any potential auroras, it's rather simple. Find a dark spot away from light pollution, and a spot with a clear view of the northern horizon, and look north.\nGood auroras can easily be viewed by the naked eye. More marginal auroras are more easily viewed with long-exposure cameras or other equipment.\nMother Nature will cooperate as far as viewing conditions are concerned, as skies will be mainly clear throughout the night. But it will be a chilly night with frost possible towards morning, so dress warmly if you're going out in search of those colorful lights.\nThe strength and duration of the geomagnetic storm can be fickle and tough to forecast, so any changes in either can increase or decrease our chances of seeing the colorful light display. But at least for now, any time after darkness settles in (sunset is 6:30 p.m. Thursday evening) may be worth a glance towards the northern skies to try your luck.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Dan Skeldon Meteorologist\nAuthor facebook Author twitter Author email Follow Dan Skeldon Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

    "text": "CROCKETT, Texas (KTRE) - The Houston County Sheriff’s Office has issued a murder warrant in connection with the disappearance of a Crockett man. On Tuesday, June 4, the sheriff’s office received a call requesting a welfare check on Patrick White, Sr., 53, of Crockett. A deputy went to White’s residence and found no one home, and his vehicle was not there. The next day, a family member filed a missing person report for White, stating the last time she spoke with him was May 17. On June 10, White’s vehicle was found and brought to the sheriff’s office. It was processed for evidence by the sheriff’s office and the Texas Rangers. During their investigation, they found sufficient evidence to get a warrant for White’s murder. On Thursday, June 13, DeShayon Maurice Knight of Crockett was charged with capital murder in the disappearance and murder of Patrick White, Sr. Knight was booked into the Houston County Jail.

    "text": "Partager: Le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a affirmé jeudi que l'économie ukrainienne a connu une croissance de 5% en 2023 par rapport à l'année précédente, et ce, malgré le conflit à la suite de l'invasion russe. Les recettes fiscales ont également augmenté dans les mêmes proportions, a déclaré Zelensky dans une allocution vidéo quotidienne. \"C'est un signe clair de la force de l'Ukraine\", a-t-il commenté. L'Union européenne s'attend également à une croissance économique d'environ 5%. En 2022, première année du conflit avec la Russie, l'économie ukrainienne s'est repliée de près de 30%. Bien que la production économique en Ukraine devrait continuer à croître dans les années à venir, l'Union européenne s'attend à ce qu'elle soit inférieure d'environ 20% à son niveau d'avant-guerre. L'Ukraine dépend cependant beaucoup de l'aide étrangère. Selon la banque centrale de Kiev, l'Ukraine a reçu plus de 38,8 milliards d'euros (42,2 milliards de dollars) en 2023.

    "text": "Narradora, poeta y traductora, Pilar Adón (Madrid, 1971) ha sido galardonada este 2023 con el Premio Nacional de Narrativa por su novela De bestias y aves (Galaxia Gutenberg), el magistral y asfixiante relato del viaje de una artista perdida (en las varias acepciones de la palabra) que acaba encerrada en una extraña finca habitada por mujeres de diferentes generaciones. 2023 ha sido el año de De bestias y aves, que tras acumular distintos galardones se ha coronado con el Nacional de Narrativa. ¿Ha sido también el año de Pilar Adón? Ahora mismo lo que prevalece es la gratitud. Supongo que seré más consciente de todo cuando pase el tiempo. ¿Qué libro la convirtió en lectora? Me gustaba estar rodeada de libros desde pequeña. No había nada comparable a sentarse en el suelo después del colegio y leer. Recuerdo El gigante egoísta y Hansel y Gretel en versiones no edulcoradas. ¿Y en escritora? Primer amor , de Turguénev . ¿A qué hora del día prefiere escribir? ¿Y en qué lugar prefiere hacerlo? A primera hora de la mañana y a última hora del día. En cuanto al lugar, antes era muy maniática con mi espacio, mi mesa, mis libros. Ahora me da lo mismo. Me he ido acostumbrando a escribir en cualquier sitio. ¿Cuál es la mejor crítica que ha recibido? Cuando alguien me dice que quiere empezar a escribir después de haber leído algo mío. ¿Y la peor? Un escritor me dijo en una ocasión que no entendía de qué vivían mis personajes. Como soy bastante controladora, me hundió. Después di con la frase de Mary McCarthy sobre poner ciruelas reales en un pastel imaginario al escribir. Si lo que importa es el pastel, resulta bastante chocante que de lo que se hable sea de las ciruelas. ¿Qué libro tiene ahora mismo en su mesilla de noche? Tengo varios. La tormenta de nieve , de Tolstói; Los pazos de Ulloa , el manuscrito de la próxima novela en castellano de Maryse Condé… ¿Uno que no logró terminar? Procuro terminarlos todos, aunque sea con una lectura oblicua. He dado con hallazgos interesantes tras páginas que me atraían poco. ¿El disco que se llevaría a una isla desierta? Ahora mismo Violet Drive , de Kerala Dust, pero hace unos días te habría dicho otro. ¿La última canción que le obsesionó? Big Eye, de Christine & the Queens. ¿Cuál es la película que ha visto más veces? Creo que Jesucristo Superstar . La vi por primera vez con 17 años, conservo el vinilo, y de vez en cuando me pongo fragmentos en YouTube. ¿Y una que le recuerde a su infancia? Ivanhoe. ¿Quién la interpretaría en un biopic sobre su vida? Una fusión entre una Charlotte Gainsbourg de mi estatura y Colleen Moore. ¿Un estreno reciente que le fascinara? No es un estreno reciente, pero me impresionó Tár . ¿Y la última que vio? Licorice Pizza , de Paul Thomas Anderson. ¿En qué museo se quedaría a vivir? En la National Portrait Gallery. ¿Tiene algún placer culpable en materia cultural? No sé si es culpable, pero me gusta tener dedicados los libros. ¿Cuál es su personaje histórico favorito? Catalina de Aragón. ¿Qué está socialmente sobrevalorado? La juventud. De no ser escritora, le habría gustado ser… Fotógrafa ¿A quién le daría el próximo premio Cervantes? A María Victoria Atencia.

    "text": "Entspannung in der akustischen Kriegsführung. Das\nnordkoreanische Militär hat offenbar seine Lautsprecheranlagen entlang der innerkoreanischen Grenze abgedreht. Wie die südkoreanische Agentur Yonhap unter Berufung auf den Generalstab berichtete, war am Donnerstag im Bereich der Demarkationszone keine Beschallung mehr zu hören.\nDabei handelt es sich offensichtlich um eine wechselseitige Entspannungsmaßnahme Nordkoreas, nachdem zuvor das südkoreanische Militär am Mittwoch seine Propaganda-Lautsprecher im Grenzgebiet nach rund einem Jahr im Einsatz abgebaut hatte.\nDie Beschallung ist Teil der psychologischen Kriegsführung zwischen den zwei Staaten, unter der vor allem die Anwohner und Soldaten rund um das stark militarisierte Grenzgebiet gelitten hatten.\nSüdkoreas neuer Präsident Lee Jae Myung hat im Zuge seines Amtsantritts angekündigt, einen diplomatischeren Kurs in seiner Nordkorea-Politik einzuschlagen und für Frieden zu sorgen. Sein Vorgänger, der konservative Yoon Suk Yeol, betonte gegenüber dem Norden eine Politik der Stärke und der klaren Kante.\nDie Spannungen auf der koreanischen Halbinsel haben während der vergangenen Jahre wieder deutlich zugenommen. So hat Pjöngjang sein Raketen- und Atomprogramm rasant modernisiert. Zudem ist Nordkorea eine militärische Kooperation mit Russland eingegangen – und hat das Land im\nUkraine-Krieg mit der Entsendung von Munition sowie Soldaten unterstützt. Es wird vermutet, dass Pjöngjang im Gegenzug Militärtechnologie von Moskau erhalten hat.\nDie beiden Länder befinden sich formal betrachtet nach wie vor in einem Kriegszustand, da der Korea-Krieg von 1950 bis 1953 nur mit einem Waffenstillstand endete, jedoch niemals ein Friedensvertrag unterzeichnet wurde.",
