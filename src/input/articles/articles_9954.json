    "text": "In the largest update for Hades 2 since the Early Access launched, the Olympic Update adds a God-like amount of new content to the game, including big additions like [new Gods and new Boons](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-best-character-designs/) alongside smaller additions like the Crossroads Renovation system. The biggest addition to Hades 2, and the namesake of the update, is the new Olympus zone. [Related ](/hades-2-all-nocturnal-arms-weapons-tools-new-olympic-update-black-coat/) [ Hades 2: All Nocturnal Arms (Weapons) & Tools ](/hades-2-all-nocturnal-arms-weapons-tools-new-olympic-update-black-coat/) Take down Chronos with this complete list of weapons and tools in Hades 2. Olympus is the mythical home of the Gods atop Mount Olympus, and until the Olympic Update players were barred from entry after a certain point – but no longer. Follow this guide to get a basic [understanding of all the new content](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-all-patch-notes-updates-hotfixes/) you can expect to find in Olympus, and to find out how to get to Olympus in Hades 2 in the first place. Hades 2 Olympus Zone Overview Enemies, Locations, Special Features, & Bosses Though this overview is very spoiler-lite, if you don't want to be spoiled on the new Olympic Update content in Hades 2 at all, skip past this section to learn how to unlock Olympus and discover all of its new additions for yourself. The first thing you will notice in terms of new Olympus content upon entering this new zone is that there is a whole new enemy type: Automatons, which are charged with [defending Olympus from invaders like Chronos'](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-guide/) armies. For some reason, the Automatons have turned on Melinoë, who must now battle past them on her way up Mount Olympus. In total, there are two new minibosses that you can find in Olympus, each kitted with a unique moveset from the rest of the game's bosses, requiring different strategies to defeat. At the end of the zone you will encounter a character that has been hinted at in other parts of Hades 2, now included as the final boss of the Olympus zone. [This terrifying Titan](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-titans-role-involvement-story-explained/) is a difficult fight if you aren't prepared for a boss mechanic that requires Melinoë to memorize patterns and avoid massive areas of effect. [Related ](/hades-2-weapon-aspects-nocturnal-arms-hidden-black-coat-nyx-selene-aspect/) Elsewhere in Olympus, you may encounter two new Allies that were hinted at in the Hades 2 Olympic Update trailer and patch notes. There are also two new Familiars that can be recruited to your side, though these aren't necessarily restricted to Olympus. These two new Familiars can be found elsewhere in [both the Underworld and the Surface](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-survive-surface-route-cure-curse-guide/). In terms of other major additions, there are of course two new Gods that you can find once you reach Olympus, both of whom are returning favorites from the first Hades. These two gods retain most of their Boons with slightly reworked mechanics, so they will feel familiar if you have any experience with the first game. How To Get To Olympus In Hades 2 To get to Olympus, you must take the Surface route when leaving the Crossroads, and progress through both the first zone Ephyrea and the second, the Rift of Thessaly. At the end of the Rift of Thessaly zone you will encounter Eris as a boss barring your way forth. Until the Olympic Update for Hades 2, Olympus was just out of reach beyond this boss fight. Though we could get just about to the ultimate end of the underground route, the surface route was locked off in the first few months of Early Access. Now, though, [once you defeat Eris](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-eris-boss-guide/) in Hades 2, you will be able to progress forth and unlock the Olympus zone. This is the third zone of the Surface route in Hades 2, and after beating its final boss you will once again be barred from continuing to the final area of the Surface route, which will likely be added in a future update in the Early Access. That is assuming that the surface will have four zones to mirror the Underworld route. It may well have more than four Zones (or unlock a final, final zone for completing both halves), giving players plenty to look forward to as the Early Access continues.

    "text": "El papa Francisco no asistirá a la audiencia jubilar prevista para este sábado, mientras que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos del domingo será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, informó este martes el Vaticano.\nLos partes médicos difundidos este lunes explicaron que el cuadro clínico del papa es “complejo”, por lo que se alargará su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma, donde está ingresado por “una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio”, que obligó a cambiarle la terapia que recibe.\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia , la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nPor el momento, sólo ha trascendido que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de hoy se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\n“El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables”, se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.\nTe puede interesar: China detiene a un individuo por “robar secretos militares” para una agencia extranjera\nPreviamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban “una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia” de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.\nEl Vaticano añadió que el “cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada”, lo que hace prever que el papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.\nCon información de EFE",

Interview Transcript Sophia Saliby: The state is expected to receive hundreds of millions of dollars due to opioid epidemic-related settlements, and work is still being done to figure out the best way to spend that money. The Whitmer administration had created an advisory group primarily made of up people of color to weigh in but recently disbanded it. Some former members of the group say they’re being silenced. Ron French is a reporter for Bridge Michigan who has been following this story. He joins me now. Thank you for being here. Ron French: It's a pleasure to be here. Saliby: Can you talk about why this group was formed and what they were tasked with doing? French: The state as a whole is receiving $1.5 billion over 18 years in opioid settlements from national lawsuits. And so far, both if you combine the state and local government units, there have been about $180 million that are already sitting in bank accounts for spending on trying to help out the crisis that we have with drug use in the state. As part of that, the state put together a group of mainly minority community advocates in this area of drug abuse, and this was put together one and a half or two years ago. And this group met frequently. They put together, I think, 24 pages of recommendations to the state. And then things sort of fell apart later. Saliby: What were these recommendations? Because that's a lot, 24 pages. Communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, more addiction and more deaths connected with opioids than in the white population. And so, it made sense for this group to be here to look at this issue. French: Because it was a racial equity workgroup did focus primarily on some equity issues that they were concerned about, and it made sense that these groups we're looking at this. Communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, more addiction and more deaths connected with opioids than in the white population. And so, it made sense for this group to be here to look at this issue. These recommendations included some things that were pretty controversial, such as drug decriminalization, a ban on pre-employment drug testing in the workplace, and there were also some things like mandatory racial equity and cultural humility training for state officials, and similar type of training for anyone who prescribes opioids such as doctors and pharmacists. So, there were some things that could have been looked at by some groups in the state as something that was possibly going too far. Saliby: From what I understand from your reporting, these recommendations were never put out in an official public capacity. That was kind of part of this issue as to why the group was disbanded, and it all kind of happened rather suddenly in these past few weeks. Can you kind of break down why this group was basically dismissed? French: Well, we really don't have a clear answer as to why they were dismissed. But the chronology of it was that this group turned in its recommendations to the state at a meeting in November. And in December, there was a meeting where, among other things, the group was asking, \"Why hasn't this report been released?\" There was a very tense meeting at which the community members who are part of this workgroup were concerned that they were being silenced, that their report was never going to be made public. It still has not been made public [other than in Bridge.](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-health-watch/michigan-disbands-racial-equity-group-tension-mounts-over-opioid-money) But state officials basically said, \"Well, we, you know, this is normal standard operating procedure for us to look through these reports and have feedback on these sorts of things.\" Which may be true, but best case scenario for the state, there was a very poor management of this group because they became very upset about this. They felt that they had put a lot of work into this and then really silenced. It's difficult for some of the members to believe this is just coincidental timing as to why this has been disbanded. They think that it's because they were being a thorn in the side of the state. So that happened in December, and then suddenly in January, they get word that they have been disbanded. And so, it's difficult for some of the members to believe this is just coincidental timing as to why this has been disbanded. They think that it's because they were being a thorn in the side of the state. Saliby: And what has the state said in response to these concerns from former members of the group that they were being silenced that, you know, it's because of these issues we had in the fall. Has the state given any explanation? French: The state says this is normal, that once a workgroup puts together its recommendations, they stop meeting. They also say that any of the members who want to can continue to work on some subcommittees on this topic with the state if they'd like to. The state says this is normal, that once a workgroup puts together its recommendations, they stop meeting. They also say that any of the members who want to can continue to work on some subcommittees on this topic with the state if they'd like to. They also say that, \"You shouldn't read into it that we don't care about racial equity. That at this point, now we're going to try to incorporate racial equity thinking in all their work on this topic as opposed to one specific workgroup.\" Saliby: As it stands, these recommendations aren't public, so there's not kind of a clear answer for if and how they'll be incorporated in making decisions about how this money will be used. Does that feel right? French: That's correct at the moment the [Opioids Task Force](https://www.michigan.gov/opioids/crisis-response), I assume, will be putting out recommendations more specific than what they have so far. That's the larger group that is, was in charge of the workgroup that was disbanded. So, we assume that the opioid task force that was put together by Governor Whitmer's administration is going to be putting out recommendations. And at that point, we may see how much of the recommendations of the racial equity workgroup put together are actually made public. So, we're sort of in a holding pattern now to see what the state will do. Saliby: Ron French is a reporter with Bridge Michigan. Thank you for being here. French: Thank you very much. This conversation has been edited for clarity and conciseness.",

It was a major diplomatic step to improve the delicate dialogue between the two countries. But this was not all. Another significant gesture was when China declared 2018 as the Year of Fr. Diego de Pantoja, in honor of the Spanish missionary who arrived there in the 1600s. Together with another Jesuit, Fr. Matteo Ricci, they evangelized by becoming part of the Chinese culture. FR. FEDERICO LOMBARDI President, Joseph Ratzinger Foundation When Fr. Matteo Ricci died he was buried in Beijing. This was the first time in history that a foreigner was buried in Beijing with the permission of the emperor. FLASH These two missionaries are very encouraging because they are the model of the kind of relationship that we can and should have with the Chinese people, as Christians and as Westerners. The Church's relationship with China is the subject of a new documentary, entitled Diego de Pantoja, SJ: A Bridge between China and the West. What makes the film unique is that it was made with a specific audience in mind: the Chinese people. FR. JESÚS FOLGADO GARCÍA Director This documentary will be in Chinese. I think this is very important. The goal is that it will be screened in China. And the documentary, is a historical film, where we describe the figure of Pantoja and who he was. I believe that the word “bridges” best defines him, meaning it is necessary to have witnesses. It is important to have people who are capable of sitting down with others to get to know each other. And this is what Pantoja did. Even Pope Francis wanted to be involved in the project. He sent a letter to the Chinese people via the documentary. In it, the Pope describes Fr. Diego as “the ambassador of Chinese culture in the West.” Throughout his papacy, Francis has emphasized his commitment to strengthening ties with China and, above all, with the Catholics who live there. FR. FEDERICO LOMBARDI President, Joseph Ratzinger Foundation Pope Francis is very interested in and has made a great contribution to developing this dialogue between China, the Catholic Church, Western culture and Chinese culture in an atmosphere of peace and respect. Fr. Diego de Pantoja was the first Spaniard to enter the forbidden zone of Beijing and helped initiate this dialogue centuries ago. His work was remarkable in adapting Christianity to the Chinese cultural reality of the time. Fr. Diego is one of the historical examples the Church looks to for continuing to pave the way and build bridges between the Holy See and China. CA TR: KG",

    "text": "The Guardian Masters of the Air: Hanks and Spielberg’s spectacular war story is the first must-watch show of 2024 Read full article Joel Golby January 20, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. · 4 min read Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Apple\nIt’s rare I do this when I watch a show, but I had to keep pausing and texting a number of my friends about Masters of the Air (Friday 26 January, Apple TV+), because it felt important to let them know. “Have you heard of Masters of the Air?” I would say, and they would say no. And I’d type out – Austin Butler’s perfect face frozen mid-toothpick-chew on my screen – “It’s like Band of Brothers but in the sky. Go and watch the trailer now.” And exactly two minutes and 31 seconds later I would get the reply: “oh shit.” And then: “oh SHIT!”\nIt’s Masters of the Air week, then, and this is very exciting. It’s sort of like – how would I describe it? Like Band of Brothers, but in the sky. They got the old production team together – no-namers Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman – and got Cary Joji Fukunaga back where he belongs, which is directing all-timer episodes of TV. (He takes the helm for the first four episodes of this limited series – the man who gave us True Detective season one and all of Maniac ! Back on TV!). They threw somewhere between $250m and $300m at it, which always works, and they assembled an unbelievable cast: Austin Butler, who you will remember from sending himself mad playing Elvis in a film that turned out to just be a music video, is one of the leads opposite Callum Turner, who is about to be the UK’s most Googled man. The rest of the cast list goes on for ever, so I won’t get to everyone, but you’ve got: Bel Powley, Anthony Boyle and Stephen Campbell Moore. You’ve got nepotism’s very own Raff Law and Sawyer Spielberg. And, due to a quirk of filming (Masters has been in production since 2012; it defected from HBO to Apple TV+ in 2019, becoming Apple Studios’ first in-house series; it was filmed, and delayed, and filmed again across 2021, dogged by Covid), it accidentally cast two of 2024’s ascendant stars, so Ncuti Gatwa is in, as is Barry Keoghan .\nIt’s Butler and Turner who dominate this one, though. It’s amazing that anyone just walks around looking like Austin Butler – he is magnetically good-looking, almost breathtakingly so, in an old-school gravity-absorbing way you thought they stopped making in the 50s – and he prowls around Masters of the Air, purring every line into Callum Turner’s ear. Butler plays Maj Gale “Buck” Clevan, and Turner is John “Bucky” Egan, and you think it would be really annoying that they have more-or-less the same name but it isn’t, not even once. It’s just astonishingly polished. The first episode lurches from a flirting-and-dancing and no-we-fly-out-in-the-morning, early-night-sir bar scene into rat-a-tat hold-your-breath action sequence so quickly it makes your head spin. And then you’re in, white knuckles throughout, each time any member of the 100th squadron takes off you feel a low clunk of dread.\nBand of Brothers (land) and its sister series The Pacific (sea) did the same thing Masters of the Air (sky) is doing: costing a lot of money, having an impeccable cast, being very good, and, crucially, toeing a careful line. It does not glorify war but depicts how impossibly young men dealt with it, then shows the true violent horror in a series of visceral, genre-defining action scenes. In Masters, the action sequences are superb – you are on the outside of a bomber with an engine failing, or you are hanging out over clouds with nothing but a crackling window between you and oblivion, or you are watching Barry Keoghan and Austin Butler do a take-off check-list from the nose of the propeller (an oddly gripping scene: I’d probably watch these two read a phonebook at each other).\nBut it’s the human scenes in between that make you care about who does and doesn’t survive each mission, and they are done amazingly, too: not over-egged, never cloying, just guys being dudes, occasionally taking a sepia-tinged photo out of their pocket and looking at it, occasionally doing a really firm handshake instead of having an emotion, sometimes drinking a whisky after their best friend just died then slapping on a smile. Sales of aviator jackets are about to go through the roof, the most annoying man you know (me) is going to start saying “wilco” in polite conversation, and Masters of the Air is going to be 2024’s first series that you rewatch entirely before the year even ends.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "„Hat fast mein Leben ruiniert“ – Mutter testet umstrittene Erziehungsmethode\nSüßkartoffelklumpen statt Babybrei: Mein Kind „würgte so heftig, dass er sich übergab“, schreibt eine Mutter, die Baby Led Weaning ausprobiert hat.\nSäuglinge saugen, Babys mampfen Brei und Kleinkinder knabbern Kekse – oder? Nicht, wenn sich ihre Eltern für die „Baby Led Weaning“-Methode (BLW) entscheiden. Bei der wird der Brei übersprungen. Sobald der Zungenstreckreflex (feste Nahrung wird automatisch wieder aus dem Mund befördert) mit etwa sechs Monaten verschwunden ist, dürfen sie bereits gekochte Karottenschnitze oder Fleischstücke ansabbern.\nBei dieser „breifreien Beikosteinführung“ ernähren sich Babys immer noch hauptsächlich vom Stillen, betonen Befürworter der Fütter-Methode. Durch die feste Beikost, die sie nur angeboten, nie aufgezwungen bekommen, lernen sie bis zum Abstillen (mit etwa zwei Jahren) verschiedene Geschmäcker kennen und selbstbestimmt zu essen.\nAngeblich bewirke dies, dass die Kinder später mal nicht übergewichtig werden, behauptete 2008 die britische Krankenschwester Gill Rapley, die Erfinderin des Baby Led Weanings. All diese Vorteile sah auch die Atlantic-Redakteurin Olga Khazan und testet die Erziehungsmethode, die ähnlich umstritten ist wie die Kuss-Fütterung, bei ihrem sechs Monate alten Sohn. „Es hat fast mein Leben ruiniert“, schreibt sie danach.\nMutter testet Baby Led Weaning: Mein Sohn „würgte so heftig, dass er sich übergab“\n„Ich mischte Putenhackfleisch mit Süßkartoffeln und legte es meinem Sohn hin. Zögernd steckte er den Klumpen in den Mund. Innerhalb weniger Sekunden würgte er so heftig, dass er sich übergab“, schreibt Khazan. Dieses Würgen sei normal, sagen Baby-Wed-Leaning-Befürworter. Der Berufsverband der Kinder- und Jugendärzte hingegen befürchtet bei der Welt, dass sich Kinder verschlucken.\nEin Kinderernährungsexperte warnt Khazan, dass viel Würgen zu einer Aversion gegen jegliche Nahrung führen könne, egal ob vom Löffel oder als feste Beikost. Ihr Sohn habe immer wieder gewürgt, irgendwann kleine Bissen genommen und sie sofort wieder ausgespuckt. Mit fast einem Jahr, wo er eigentlich keine Säuglingsnahrung mehr brauchen müsste, habe er täglich nur 50 Kalorien feste Nahrung zu sich genommen. „Wir wussten nicht, was wir tun sollten“, schreibt die Journalistin.\nIm Internet stößt sie auf den Tipp, das Kind mit zerdrückter oder pürierter Nahrung (also Brei) zu füttern, wenn Baby Led Weaning nicht funktioniere. Auch eine Kinderärztin habe ihr das empfohlen. „Ich bekam das Gefühl, dass es weniger wissenschaftliche Belege gibt, als Befürworter behaupten.“ Der Ernährungspsychologe Thomas Ellrott bestätigt bei BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA: „Die wissenschaftliche Bewertung von möglichen Vor- und Nachteilen ist beim Baby Led Weaning noch nicht mit der nötigen Sicherheit möglich.“\nBaby Led Weaning: „Mein Baby ist nicht besonders schlau“\nKhazan spricht für ihren Text zu Baby Led Weaning mit einigen Experten und Expertinnen und stellt fest, dass es zwar für manche Babys gut ist, für manche aber auch das Füttern mit dem Löffel mehr Sinn ergibt. „Grundsätzlich sollte Baby Led Weaning funktionieren können, da unsere fernen Vorfahren wahrscheinlich nicht immer Breikost zur Verfügung stellen konnten“, sagt Ellrott BuzzFeed News Deutschland.\nDoch das System und auch die Beratung in der Baby-Ernährung seien auf den „Übergang mit einer Breikost-Phase optimiert“, ergänzt der Ernährungspsychologe, der an der Georg-August-Universität Göttingen lehrt. „Das funktioniert in den meisten Fällen auch gut.“ Besonders bei Eltern wie Khazan, die feststellt, dass sie zu Hause eigentlich nie etwas koche, das ihr Baby auch essen dürfe: salzige und scharfe Soßen etwa, Salate mit Nüssen, Fertiggerichte und vieles mehr.\nSelbstbestimmtheit hin oder her: „Mein Baby ist nicht besonders schlau“, schreibt die Mutter. „Leider versteht es nicht instinktiv, wie man sich reich an verschiedenen Makronährstoffen ernährt, um die Säuglingsnahrung altersgerecht zu ergänzen.“ Das sei ihr Job und sie werde ihren Sohn dabei anleiten – wo nötig eben mit Babybrei.",

    "text": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - As fall rolls into the hills and mountains of West Virginia, the vibrant colors are beginning to grace the treetops of the Kanawha State Forest. West Virginia draws in visitors from across the country to admire them. “Thanks to our mountainous landscape, West Virginia’s amazing foliage can be seen for an extended period of time,” said West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby. “Stunning hues can still be found in the highest elevations of the state while lower elevations are beginning to pop with glimpses of the exceptional fall color, with even more to come. There’s still plenty of time to plan your leaf-peeping adventure to the Mountain State!” Brian Haga, the Assistant Superintendent at the Kanawha State Forest, said the Kanawha Valley is a few weeks away from its peak season. “The majority of the Kanawha Valley is going to see that color change at the end of October. Lasting throughout the month of November, so it’s the last place in the state where you are going to see that peak foliage,” Haga said. If you’re planning a fall getaway or day trip across the state, the West Virginia Department of Tourism has a few tools to help. West Virginia Department of Tourism’s live leaf tracker features user-generated photos from social media to show current conditions. Haga recommends a hike up to Castle Rock trail in the Kanawha State Forest for some of the best views. Visitors can access the trail by taking the CCC snipe trail to the top of the hill to Mossy Rock, according to Haga. “You are able to see a nice valley and see that multitude of different colors ... the reds and oranges,” Haga said.

Photo News Par Sudinfo avec Belga Publié le 28/12/2023 à 23:47 Temps de lecture: 1 min A rsenal et Leandro Trossard se sont inclinés 0-2 face à West Ham jeudi lors de la 19e journée de Premier League. Les Gunners laissent ainsi la 1e place à Liverpool, qui est allé gagner 0-2 à Burnley mardi. Les Reds terminent l’année 2023 en tête avec 42 points, 2 de plus qu’Arsenal.\nLeandro Trossard a débuté la rencontre et a cédé sa place à Emile Smith-Rowe à la 79e, quelques minutes après avoir manqué une occasion.\nLes Hammers, qui avaient déjà éliminé Arsenal en Coupe de la Ligue en novembre, ont ouvert le score par Tomas Soucek à la 13e minute. Arsenal a ensuite dominé les débats mais a manqué de réalisme et Konstantinos Mavropanos a doublé la mise pour les visiteurs à la 55e minute.\nWest Ham est 6e avec 33 points, à 2 unités de la 5e place de Tottenham, qui a été battu 4-2 à Brighton jeudi. Les Spurs étaient déjà dominés 2-0 à la mi-temps. Le jeune brésilien Joao Pedro a inscrit un doublé et fait oublier l’absence momentanée de Mitoma, blessé.",
