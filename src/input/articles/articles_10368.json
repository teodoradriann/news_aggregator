Al menos es de los unicos que no se deja en ridiculo el solo y sabe callarse cuando tiene que callarse y atacar cuando tiene que atacar\n[#32](c32#c-32) Alemania. En base a la autonomia de sus regiones. Nunca vas a ver policias regionales en Europa en ningun pais mas que Alemania y España por ejemplo\nEs que dicen la verdad! España se rompe! pero no han dicho cuando será!\nmalditos rojos! (da igual cuando lo leas)\nSi España se rompiera les pasaría como con ETA que parece que la siguen necesitando para culpabilizarla de todos los males.\nPues con los independentistas sería lo mismo. Echarían la culpa de todos los males España (la de verdad) a laz zonas ex-españoles.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Si la mitad de los políticos que están en el congreso fueran como este otro gallo cantaría en este país\nQue sí campeón, que sigáis tratando de darle la vuelta al asunto. Si lo hace vuestra amada derecha, nunca pasa nada.\n[#12](c12#c-12) ¿Y eso ha pasado en los últimos 47 años?¿O pasará en los próximos 47? ¿Han acertado los del Partido Podrido, o sólo pretendían tomarte el pelo?\nLa hemeroteca que bonita es:\nhttps://www.publico.es/actualidad/18-meses-dejare-mi-escano.html\nRufian ¿cuando decias dejabas el escaño? se ve que esta muy calentico.\n[#15](c15#c-15) Lo de leer la propia noticia que enlazas y no quedar en ridículo no lo llevas bien, ¿verdad?\nEn cualquier caso, si Catalunya logra la desconexión, ¿dejará su escaño?\nEse mismo día, de forma inmediata, todos los diputados de ERC. No tendría ningún sentido quedarnos y la imagen sería muy potente. Los diputados que iremos a Madrid seremos una especie de delegación diplomática en defensa de la República Catalana. Irnos cuando la logremos, sería una imagen hermosa.\nEntonces prevé una estancia corta en Madrid…\nSí, sí, 18 meses. Lo que está pactado. Y vamos a cumplir los tiempos.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Resumiendo \"si catalunña se desconecta me piro, si no, sigo de diputado en un país del cual me quiero separar, porque... a ver, soy catalán y la pela es la pela\"\nLo deja incluso peor, porque aparte de mentiroso, es un pesetero.\n[#15](c15#c-15) lo bonito es leerse la hemeroteca que se cita para no quedar como un idiota.\nLéetelo más allá del titular, anda, y deja de hacer el ridículo.",

    "text": "The booking photo for Connor Hilton. Galveston County Sheriff's Office A Texas teenager accused of shooting two people at his home, one fatally, allegedly told police that he wanted to \"commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to newly released court documents.\nThe suspect -- 17-year-old Connor Hilton -- was showing the two victims a revolver at his Friendswood home Saturday night when he allegedly shot them both in the head, according to a complaint charging the teen with murder.\nA third person who was at the house that night called 911 while hiding in the bathroom and reported hearing two gunshots, according to the complaint.\nThe booking photo for Connor Hilton. Galveston County Sheriff's Office Responding officers found Hilton outside the home appearing \"visibly distraught,\" the complaint stated. When asked by police if anyone was hurt, Hilton nodded yes then held up two fingers, motioned toward the house and said there were two teenagers inside he believed to be dead, according to the complaint.\nOnce inside, an officer found two male victims -- identified as Ethan Riley, 18, and Benjamin Bliek, 19 -- lying on the floor with gunshot wounds as well as a revolver on a table, according to the complaint.\nA second officer located the 911 caller, who \"reported hearing Hilton walk by the bathroom door crying and stating, 'What have I done,'\" the complaint stated.\nMORE: Body believed to be missing pregnant teen found with gunshot wound: Police\nThe shooting victims were transported to local hospitals in critical condition. Riley succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, while Bliek remains in critical condition, police said.\nHilton was brought in for questioning following the shooting and was initially charged by the Galveston County District Attorney's Office with two counts of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury.\nHe was released after posting $1 million bond before being arrested again at his home on Monday for murder, police said. He is currently being held at the Galveston County Jail on no bond.\nConnor Hilton is seen being taken into custody in Friendswood, Texas, on Dec. 25, 2023. KTRK While being interviewed by police following the shooting, Hilton allegedly confessed to pulling the trigger and said there was no disturbance or disagreement that night, according to the complaint.\nHe allegedly told police \"he had thought about, and wanted, to commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to the complaint. He allegedly said he had talked his mother into buying him a handgun, which he wanted \"with the intent of shooting someone and/or himself,\" according to the complaint.\n\"Hilton stated that he fully understands what he had done and that he should be held accountable,\" the complaint stated.\nMORE: Florida mall shooting: Reward up to $10,000 as police hunt for suspect\nHilton's attorney, Jennifer Carpenter, told ABC News that his mother did not purchase a gun for him.\n\"The parents of Connor Hilton cannot express enough their deepest condolences to the victims' families who have been heavily on the Hiltons' hearts and minds as they try to navigate this devastating situation,\" Hilton's family said in a statement released through the attorney on Thursday.\n\"The Hilton family wants to thank everyone who has reached out in love and support, including all who sent positive comments about Connor's character and good nature in general,\" the statement continued. \"The family asks for continued prayers for everyone affected, especially the victims' families.\"\nHis attorney has filed a motion seeking to conduct a hearing to determine whether his statements to police can be admissible in court, claiming they were not made and preserved in compliance with state law.\nHilton is scheduled to appear in court for a status conference on Feb. 2, online court records show.",

    "text": "Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared an account of how he currently uses artificial intelligence, describing it as a powerful tool for learning and critical thinking. At the same time, he warned against becoming overly reliant on it.In a post on X, Vembu called himself a moderate to heavy user of AI, and went on to outline his thoughts on its strengths and limitations.According to Vembu, AI has proven to be a far superior learning aid than traditional web search. “My web search has gone down 80% as a direct result,” he wrote, explaining how AI helps him learn faster.He also highlighted how AI serves as a “good debating partner”, adding that he often takes the output from one AI and asks another to critique it. This, he said, helps deepen his understanding.However, his praise for the technology came with some strong warnings.He advised against using AI to create new content. “AI can help customer support agents do their work faster but it is unwise to let AI replace human agents. It is also unwise for a human to copy-paste AI text and send it to a customer, hiding the fact that it came from AI.”On the topic of programming, Vembu stressed that any AI-generated code must go through thorough checks for compliance, privacy, and security. These checks, he admitted, are “neither easy nor fun for humans to do”.He also opined that programmers who submit AI-generated code without carrying out these checks are “failing at their job”. He went so far as to say that AI could sometimes slow down the development process.Vembu then encouraged Zoho programmers to use AI as a tool for learning and exploration, rather than as a shortcut for generating unchecked content or delivering code.He concluded by saying the company is “running a lot of experiments” and that his perspective may shift over time as “facts change on the ground”.",

    "title": "Young 3PL set to add 20 jobs in 2024 despite tough market - Business News",
    "text": "(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Wagon founders Robert Rajfar and Tyler Sala set out to build a 3PL characterized by integrity and a genuine dedication to best-in-class customer service. Following a successful fourth quarter, the company is looking toward its 2024 goals – from enhancing its instantiation capabilities to establishing itself as a partner in food and beverage, HAZMAT and other high-value spaces. To accomplish these goals, Rajfar and Sala are looking to add several like-minded logistics professionals to their sales and customer success teams. Overall, the company plans to add 20 jobs in the coming year. For those interested in positions at Wagon, it's important to understand what the company means by “best-in-class customer service.” “Everyone says they're customer-centric, but no one talks about what that actually means,” said Pat Stradinger, vice president of customer success at Waggon. Rajfer's definition of “best-in-class customer experience” means being readily available, offering fair but competitive prices, and having an owner's mentality. He said it is important for the entire organization, not just the leadership team, to stick with the same set of customer-first values. Most of all, it's important for new Wagan employees to be curious and excited to learn. “I had a lot of success early in my career when I became more curious,” Salas said. Curious people have a natural desire to look deeper, making them more inclined to gain knowledge about how supply chains work on a global scale. This change in perspective is called moving from A to B thinking to A to Z thinking. Wagon wants to hire A to Z thinkers. In addition to being curious and dedicated to customer service, all Wagon Teammates must be excited to help build a company from the ground up. This work requires a far higher level of patience than more corporate positions – and a far more developed ability to wear multiple hats within the organization. “We're looking for serious individuals, people who have been in the trenches,” Stradinger said. “We want to know that our customers are interacting with experts.” Wagon wants to hear from people who agree with this description – especially curious, serious logistics professionals who have a solid base of industry knowledge and a desire to create something new.
