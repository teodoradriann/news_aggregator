    "text": "Wildfire smoke impacts on IVF pregnancy Women undergoing fertility treatment in wildfire-prone areas may face added challenges in conceiving due to poor air quality, according to a recent study conducted by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University.\nThe study, published in the journal Fertility & Sterility, examined the impact of unhealthy air quality from the 2020 Labor Day wildfires — which burned over 1 million acres in Oregon — on patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.\nResearchers studied 69 patients who underwent ovarian stimulation and IVF treatment during the six weeks leading up to and after the 2020 wildfires, which caused 10 days of hazardous air quality in southern Oregon. The findings revealed that poor air quality negatively impacted both the treatments and its effectiveness.\nSpecifically, patients exposed to wildfire smoke had fewer blastocysts —clusters of 150 to 200 cells essential for conceiving — compared to those who were not exposed, who had more blastocysts.\nDuring IVF treatments, patients receive hormone injections for one to two weeks to stimulate egg production. The eggs are then retrieved and fertilized to develop into blastocysts, which can become embryos and, eventually, fetuses.\nIn 2022, IVF-assisted pregnancies represented 2.5% of all births, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .\nDr. Molly Kornfield, the study’s lead author and assistant professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the OHSU Center for Women’s Health, launched the research after being four weeks pregnant in Portland during the 2020 wildfires. She wanted to better understand the effects of poor air quality on IVF.\n“Most of the data out there is on chronic air pollution, so we look at cities chronically exposed, like New York City and Los Angeles, whereas Portland is a metropolitan area of good air quality. So it’s this really unique opportunity to look at this place with good air quality and then 10 days of really poor air quality, and [see] what impact does that have,” she said\nKornfield said that while most patients still became pregnant, and fertility clinics monitor air quality closely, she advises women undergoing IVF in wildfire-affected areas to use air filtration systems, limit time outside and wear an N95 mask when going outdoors.\nAlthough the study didn’t address the impact of wildfire smoke on traditional pregnancies, Kornfield said other research shows pregnant women are also vulnerable to poor air quality.\nA 2023 study published in Cureus: Journal of Medical Science suggests that air pollution may harm lung development indirectly by causing low birth weight, premature birth or impaired immune system development.\nMontana is no stranger to poor air quality from wildfire smoke originating from within the state and from Canada. In July, residents of Gallatin County lived with air quality ranging from moderate to unhealthy due to ongoing fires alongside scorching heat and minimal precipitation.\nBozeman’s air quality scored a 60 and was of moderate quality on Thursday afternoon, according to an air quality map published by the federal government at www.airnow.gov .\nThe government’s air quality monitoring standards includes six quality levels: good, 0-50; moderate, 51-100; unhealthy for sensitive groups, 101-150; unhealthy, 151-200; very unhealthy, 201-300; and hazardous, 301 and higher.\nThe following values were recorded Thursday afternoon for these cities:\nBig Sky: 60 Livingston: 60 Helena: 53 Great Falls: 62 Missoula: 53 Billings: 61 Denver, Colorado: 50 Boise, Idaho: 72 Seattle, Washington: 46 Portland, Oregon: 37 Los Angeles, California: 67 San Francisco, California: 14 A 2016 study found that climate change doubled the number of large fires in the western U.S. between 1984 and 2015 by accelerating the drying of organic matter, including ground and surface fuels. A 2021 study further confirmed that climate change has been the main driver of increased fire weather in the region.\nDespite wildfires and smoke becoming a part of daily life nationwide, the study found that treatments improved once the wildfires ended.\n“As of anything in health, it’s all in moderation, and different people have different risk factors and different abilities to tolerate poor air quality,” Kornfield said. “But I think, in general, minimizing exposure as much as possible is probably best, not just for reproduction, but for for all facets of health.”\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Lilly Keller can be reached at lkeller@dailychronicle.com .\n(0 Ratings)",

    "text": "Photo: Malle-Liisa Raigla\nPhoto: Malle-Liisa Raigla The weather service has given Läänemaa a level two warning for this evening, that in addition to strong wind, sleet may fall in the rain in the evening and the roads will become slippery at times.\nOn Friday evening, the north-west wind in Läänemaa can reach a gust of 25 meters per second, in the Väina Sea the gusts can reach 28 meters per second.\nTS Laevad, which maintains the wrong connection between the mainland and Hiiumaa , has already warned that the departure of the last two ferries on the Rohuküla-Heltermaa ferry line is in danger on Friday evening due to strong winds and a rapid rise in the water level.\nAccording to Guldar Kivro, head of TS Laevade’s shipping department and member of the board, the departure of Hiiumaa line ships is affected by two weather-related phenomena, one of which is the strengthening of the northwest wind, which can gust up to 30 m/s in the evening, and the other is a rapid rise in the water level. “Due to the high water level, the shore ramp does not match the ship’s ramp and vehicles cannot get on and off the ship. This will also affect Saturday morning departures”, said Kivro.\nKihnu Veeteed, which is connected to Vormsi island, has announced that due to the high water level, the passenger ferry Ormsö will not accept vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tons on Friday.\nThe weather service warns that sleet may fall between the rain and roads will become slippery in places on Friday night.\n2024-11-01 14:14:00\n#weather #service #warns #strong #wind #sleet #high #water #level #disrupts #ferry #traffic\n**Interview with AI Specialist, Dr. ⁤Emily Cartwright**\n*Editor:* Today, we have ⁢Dr. Emily Cartwright, an AI specialist with over a decade ‌of ‌experience in the field, joining us to discuss crucial interview questions for⁤ aspiring AI ​engineers.
