    "text": "2023-12-30 06:45:09 The 25 teenagers from the Kfar Aza community warned their teachers that for five days, they would not come to class: the small group of young people decided to go from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, on foot, to alert the country about the plight of the 129 hostages still held by Hamas. Among them, five are from their kibbutz on the edge of the Gaza Strip, where more than 60 people were killed on October 7. With the support of Israel Scouts, the high school students organized meetings with other students from across the country along the way. Also read the decryption: Article reserved for our subscribers In Gaza, failing to achieve its objectives, Israel promises a “long” war On Wednesday, December 27, more than 2,000 people gathered in the courtyard of the HaYovel school, planted on top of a hill in Mevasseret Tsion, 6 kilometers west of Jerusalem. Amidst the flags of Israel, banners “take them home” and photographs of the missing, the students sit in a circle, silent. In each group, a young person from Kfar Aza shares his story, his trauma, his frustrations at seeing the hostage situation get bogged down, even if no one openly criticizes the army. Between two discussions, Nadav, 16, in a t-shirt displaying the slogan “let us live with our hostages”precise : “We want to mark all of Israeli society. » After a truce from November 24 to December 1, which allowed the release of 110 Israeli hostages and a few hundred Palestinian prisoners, the diplomatic negotiations necessary for new exchanges today seem bogged down. The latest negotiations between Israel and Hamas, through Qatar and Egypt, have stalled due to the Palestinian group’s refusal to continue discussions without a prior ceasefire. On December 24, Egypt proposed its own exit plan from the crisis, with repeated interruptions of the military operation and the gradual release of all the hostages. On December 27, following a request from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed Mikhail Bogdanov, Deputy Foreign Minister, to lead new talks.

ADRIENNE SURPRENANT / MYOP POUR « THE WORLD » Gome Hamias, 17, from Kfar Aza, one of the organizers of a march organized by teenagers from her kibbutz from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to alert people to the situation of the hostages still in Gaza, Mevasseret Tsion (Israel), December 27, 2023. ADRIENNE SURPRENANT / MYOP POUR “LE MONDE” The idea of the Kfar Aza youth march arose on Friday, December 15, the day “tragic” where three hostages were killed by the Israeli army during an operation in the Gaza Strip. Two of them, Alon Shamriz, 26, and Yotam Haim, 28, were from Kfar Aza. Upset, a group of around ten young people from the kibbutz wanted to act despite their grief, says Gome Hamias, 17 years old. With a determined look behind her large glasses, the teenager recounts how they debated the best method, just hours after the announcement of their friends’ deaths: a ” in the “ in Tel Aviv? A demonstration in Habima Square, where families of hostages usually gather in Israel’s big city? Something was needed ” stronger “describes the teenager. You have 40% of this article left to read.

    "text": "The Washington Commanders have placed rookie running back\n[Chris Rodriguez](//247sports.com/Player/chris-rodriguez-92062) on injured reserve, effectively ending his season, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\nThe announcement comes just days after the former Kentucky standout found the endzone for the first time in his young NFL career on Sunday.\nRodriguez rushed 10 times for a career-high 58 yards and two touchdowns in the Commanders' 30-28 loss to the New York Jets in Week 16.\nHe scored his first touchdown from 12 yards out to give Washington its first score of the day midway through the second quarter and then again from 1-yard out in the fourth quarter. Rodriguez was the highest-graded running back in the NFL for Week 16 according to Pro Football Focus (84.9).\nRodriguez became the first Kentucky running back with a multi-touchdown game in the NFL regular season since\n[Artose Pinner](//247Sports.com/Player/Artose-Pinner-74705) in 2006.\nOn the season, Rodriguez recorded 51 carries for 247 yards and two scores, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. He ranks third on the Commanders in rushing behind only running back\n[Brian Robinson](//247Sports.com/Player/Brian-Robinson-78961) and quarterback [Sam Howell](//247sports.com/Player/sam-howell-91707).\nWashington selected Rodriguez with the 193rd overall pick in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL Draft. Rodriguez signed his rookie deal with the Commanders in May. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but according to SpoTrac, Rodriguez signed a 4-year deal worth $4.01 million, including a guaranteed signing bonus of $177, 688.\nHe already has a big fan in first-year Washington offensive coordinator\n[Eric Bieniemy](//247sports.com/Coach/eric-bieniemy-1445).\n\"This is a guy that Eric was very high on,\" head coach\n[Ron Rivera](//247sports.com/Coach/ron-rivera-3429) said. \"He's a guy that Eric thinks will most certainly have a role for us on the offensive side. Adding a physical player in Christopher is a guy that, talking to Eric and what Eric wants to do and how he wants to use him, in Eric's mind, this is a guy that will fit what he wants,\" Rivera said. \"And so we're pretty excited about being able to pick him. We had a higher grade on him too as well. So we thought we got a lot of value here.\"\nRodriguez, a 5-foot-11, 204-pound native of McDonough, Georgia, finished his stellar collegiate career ranked third on UK’s all-time rushing list with 3,644 yards and became just the fourth player in program history to eclipse the 3,000-yard rushing mark. He also had 32 career rushing touchdowns, the second-most in school history, and his 35 career total touchdowns were the third-most in school history. He also averaged 6.2 career yards per carry, which ranks third in program history and charted a school-best 20 100-yard games.\nAs a senior in 2022, Rodriguez 904 yards and six touchdowns despite playing in just eight games. Rodriguez averaged 113 yards per game and 5.2 yards per carry. In Kentucky's 27-17 win over No. 16 Mississippi State on Oct. 15, Rodriguez carried the ball 31 times for 197 yards and two scores, one of five 100-yard rushing games on the season.\nAfter missing the first four games of the season due to suspension, Rodriguez opted out of the Wildcats' Music City Bowl loss to Iowa.\nHis 1,379 yards rushing in 2021 ranks fifth on the UK’s single-season list. That season, he became the 10th player in school history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and it marked just the 14th time in school history a Wildcat accomplished that feat. His nine 100-yard games as a junior also set a single-season record. Rodriguez' 207 rushing yards in a win over Missouri was a career-high and ranked just outside the top-10 single game rushing performances in school history.\nThe two-time team captain graduated in May of 2022 with a degree in community and leadership development.\nComing out of Ola High School in McDonough, Ga., Rodriguez was rated as a 3-star prospect and ranked as the No. 64 running back in the 2018 class by the industry average 247Sports Composite, choosing the Wildcats over Ole Miss and Mississippi State among others.",

    "text": "By Iain Payten September 6, 2024 — 6.29am Save Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later. Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\nGot it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Robbie Deans was in the middle of a generational rebuild of the Wallabies when England arrived for a mid-year tour in 2010 armed primarily with Jonny Wilkinson and a strong forward pack.\nInjury had also sidelined some star Wallabies for the first clash in Perth, so Deans sent out a front-row with two caps Test experience between them. Things went as well as you’d expect.\nBy the time 21-year-old prop James Slipper came off the bench in the 66th minute for another debut, referee Nigel Owens had hammered the raw Australian scrum and given the tourists a penalty try.\n“We were looking to expose some next-generation players, and Slips had the cut of a thoroughbred, basically,” Deans told this masthead from Japan.\n“We saw great possibility in him … but yeah, we certainly threw him in the deep end.”\nWith just three Super Rugby caps to his name, Slipper’s first taste of Test rugby was a spine-bending scrum hard up on the Wallaby line. Three collapsed scrums later Owens sin-binned Salesi Maafu, which forced Slipper to shift across to tighthead. Three more scrum resets followed and, despite Slipper putting up a good fight, three more collapses caused Owens to shake his head and award another penalty try to England.\nA fresh-faced James Slipper in 2010, and pictured (right) before the Rugby World Cup in 2023. Credit: Getty\nSix scrums, five minutes, two positions and a penalty try. Welcome to first grade, son.\n“Subiaco Oval – I’ll never forget that night,” Slipper said.\nAdvertisement “I got put on into a five-metre scrum and ended up playing both loose head and tight end. They ended up with a penalty try. It was a tough encounter, especially for me on debut. But until this day, that’s still my favourite game.”\nDeans: “Slips stood up, and he has done that ever since. That’s what you want.”\nThe Wallabies hung on to win the Test and, in 15 short minutes, young Slipper had earned his stripes. The Gold Coast-raised prop soon became a mainstay for Deans, and 14 years and six Wallabies coaches later, Slipper is still going strong.\nNow 35, Slipper was named on the Wallabies bench to play Argentina in Santa Fe on Sunday for what will be his 139th Test appearance. It will bring Slipper alongside George Gregan for the most-capped Wallaby player of all time, a record that has stood since the legendary halfback retired in 2007.\nBarring misfortune, Slipper can claim the record outright in Sydney against the All Blacks later in the month.\n“It’s a proud moment for me. It’s one of those things; you set out in your career and you don’t really expect to get that many games,” Slipper said.\n“So I’m very lucky. I feel like I’ve had a lot of luck. My timing’s been good and a lot of hard work’s gone into it.”\nSlipper captained the Wallabies for the first time in 2015 against the USA but fell out of the picture after suffering an Achilles rupture in 2017, and then receiving a suspension in 2018 after personal issues led to a positive drug test and him getting the boot from the Reds.\nJames Slipper in action against the Pumas in 2023. Credit: Getty\n“I remember saying at the time that I didn’t know if I was going to play again. Thinking back now, the Wallabies wasn’t a goal of mine at the time, to get back into the international team. It was more about sorting out my life and getting back playing rugby of any sort,” Slipper said.\n“That was at the Brumbies. I look back now, it was obviously a bit of adversity in my journey. But it’s probably paved the way for where I’m at now.”\nSlipper moved to Canberra in 2019 and rebuilt his life and career . He went to the 2019 and 2023 World Cups, returned as an occasional Wallabies captain and has steadily ticked off records of all sorts. He is the most-capped Australian in Super Rugby, too, with 183 games.\nLoading “It is quite an achievement in what he has been able to do in his career,” Deans said.\n“Obviously it hasn’t been straightforward and he has had to deal with adversity, but that’s one of the key skills any player needs. It is how you respond to those challenges that counts, and he has just kept coming. And growing.”\nSlipper jokes that much has changed in the Wallabies environment since 2010 – “the music has changed a fair bit” – but 138 Tests of hard-earned experience translates to a captive audience when the humble veteran speaks up, said Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt.\n“Because he doesn’t speak often, I think the words resonate just a little bit more,” Schmidt said.\n“He’s really humble and just gets on with the job. He’s massively invested in the Wallabies. His efforts, no matter where you are or what the requirement is, he’s just really keen to do what’s best for the team.”\nA record-equalling Test for Slipper will be memorable at the other end of the scale for Max Jorgensen, who was named on the wing to make his first start, and reserve lock Josh Canham, who is set for a Test debut.\nLooking to post consecutive wins after a one-point victory in La Plata, Schmidt was forced to reshuffle his backline due to injuries to five-eighth Noah Lolesio and fullback Tom Wright. Ben Donaldson has been recalled into the No.10 shirt, and Andrew Kellaway shifted back to No.15.\nLoading That has also given Jorgensen, 20, the chance to start in only his third Test after two assured cameos from the bench.\nIn the only other change, injury to big lock Lukhan Salakaia-Loto allows Jeremy William to return to the run-on side and Canham onto the bench for the first time. The Melbourne-raised lock was a surprise omission from the July squad after a breakout season for the Rebels, but he was sent away to bulk up by Schmidt and now gets his chance.\nTom Lynagh and Josh Flook also join the bench.\nArgentina v Wallabies, live and exclusive on Stan Sport from 4am, Sunday, September 8.",

    "text": "Mundo | Guerra no Médio Oriente Força Aérea israelita prepara-se para apoiar tropas terrestres no Líbano por Lusa Quer partilhar este artigo? cancelar Ouvir\nO comandante da Força Aérea israelita disse hoje que as suas unidades estão a preparar-se para apoiar uma operação terrestre no Líbano, com vista a degradar o grupo xiita Hezbollah e interromper o abastecimento de armas do Irão.\nVER MAIS \"Estamos a preparar-nos lado a lado com o Comando Norte para uma manobra terrestre. Preparados se [formos] ativados\", afirmou Tomer Bar junto de vários militares num vídeo distribuído pelas Forças Armadas israelitas, acrescentando que esta é uma decisão a ser tomada acima dos comandos militares.\nEste pronunciamento surge um dia após o chefe do Estado-Maior israelita, Herzi Halevi, ter indicado que os ataques aéreos ao Líbano nos últimos dias servem para preparar o terreno para uma possível incursão terrestre contra o Hezbollah.\nHalevi referiu que uma eventual operação israelita consistiria em entrar em cidades do sul do Líbano que o Hezbollah \"converteu numa grande base militar\", para destruir infraestruturas militares usadas pelo grupo xiita aliado do Irão.\nNo vídeo hoje distribuído pelas Forças Armadas, o comandante da Força Aérea reforçou as palavras de Halevi, observando que as suas unidades deverão \"evitar qualquer possibilidade de transferência de armas do Irão para o Líbano\", numa missão que se tornou numa \"prioridade máxima\".\nA confiança do líder do Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, e a capacidade do grupo xiita libanês em recuperar dos intensos ataques que sofreu nos últimos dias \"depende do abastecimento\" do aliado iraniano, justificou.\nTomer Bar observou também que, no Comando Sul, a propósito das operações no último ano contra o grupo islamita palestiniano Hamas, o apoio aéreo acompanhou cada equipa de combate na Faixa de Gaza e que esse será igualmente \"o ponto de partida\" caso seja dada a ordem de atacar o Líbano.\nO comandante da Força Aérea alertou, no entanto, que as \"ameaças são maiores\" no país vizinho e destacou a importância do uso de operações combinadas, aéreas e terrestres, para manter a pressão sobre o Hezbollah, atingindo alvos previamente planeados ou que surjam em tempo real.\n\"Esta pressão aumentará conforme necessário, sem limitações a áreas ou tipos específicos. É subterrânea, acima do solo, no sul do Líbano e também em Beirute, desde que ameace os residentes de Israel e não apenas os do norte\", declarou o comandante militar, que insistiu na oportunidade de degradar o Hezbollah \"de forma organizada\".\nIsrael e Hezbollah estão envolvidos num intenso fogo cruzado diário desde 07 de outubro de 2023, após o ataque do Hamas em solo israelita que desencadeou a atual guerra na Faixa de Gaza, levando a que dezenas de milhares de pessoas tenham abandonado as suas casas em ambos os lados da fronteira israelo-libanesa.\nOs ataques de Israel contra o Hezbollah intensificaram-se de forma substancial nos últimos dias, após as autoridades militares de Telavive terem anunciado uma deslocação das operações da Faixa de Gaza para o norte do país.\nTópicos Oriente , Faixa , Aérea 'Oriente','Faixa','Aérea' Quer partilhar este artigo? cancelar PUB",

    "text": "You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit [image gallery](/image_purchases) to purchase the image. New Year's Eve could be a wet one for parts of eastern Australia, with more severe weather forecast for the weekend. The Bureau of Meteorology says widespread showers and possibly thunderstorms are set to return to New South Wales and Queensland from Friday. Northeast NSW will bear the brunt of the rain in that state, with isolated and possibly severe thunderstorms into Sunday. Scattered showers are forecast for the remainder of the coast, with the chance of storms. Queensland is also expected to be hit by wet weather, with isolated showers and thunderstorms forecast across much of the state on Saturday, apart from the far southwest. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible ... between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" according to senior meteorologist Sarah Scully. Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia. Showers and storms are a chance across parts of southern and eastern Australia on Friday, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria, Ms Scully said. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms about Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. \"Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend,\" she said. \"The focus areas will be northeast NSW and southeast and central Queensland. \"There are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday.\" Storms and flash flooding across southeast Queensland have claimed seven lives since Christmas and caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure. Thousands of people remain without power in dangerous heatwave conditions not expected to ease until Saturday. Wild weather has also ravaged NSW and Victoria, with three people killed by flash flooding and a falling branch on Boxing Day.",

    "text": "[Donate to the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis Appeal](?form=israelipalestiniancrisis) The terrible situation in Gaza is tearing lives apart. Your donation today will help with the practical support to help where possible. 2023 has not been without its challenges – from conflicts new and ongoing, to droughts and floods, and a cost-of-living crisis felt both here in the UK and the world over. Over these past 12 months we have been buoyed by our incredible supporters, who have donated to our humanitarian appeals, spoken out about injustice to MPs, joined us in prayer and fundraised in their schools, churches and communities. Thank you to everyone who has stood by us to help those most in need across the world. Here are some moments from 2023. The Turkey and Syria earthquake killed over 50,000 people and left millions without homes. CAFOD joined the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to [launch a major appeal](/give/donate-to-emergencies/turkey-syria-earthquake-appeal), and once again our supporters showed their enormous generosity. Our local partners were able to provide emergency shelter, food, warm blankets and winter kits. We are still there, supporting affected families. In February [CAFOD staff and partners were thrilled to welcome Pope Francis](/news/international-news/reaching-communities-in-drc) on his long-anticipated visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan. He met people forced to flee their homes to escape violence and prayed for peace and an end to division. In the spring people tied up their laces for our Big Lent Walk which saw thousands of people, including 650 schools, support CAFOD’s work by walking, donating and praying. Next year’s event is due to be even bigger, as we join our sister agency in Scotland, SCIAF, to encourage people to walk 200km over the 40 days of Lent. In the last academic year (2022-2023), Catholic schools in England and Wales raised an amazing £610,000 for CAFOD. Thirty-seven more schools achieved the [LiveSimply Award](/campaign/livesimply-award/livesimply-award-for-schools) – an initiative which sees schools committing to live simply, sustainably and in solidarity with the world’s poorest. [Jenny Garzón Saavedra](/education/laudato-si-for-schools/jenny-in-colombia), youth worker for our church partner FUNVIPAS in the Colombian Amazon, spoke to 8,000 young Catholics at Wembley Arena in March for Flame – the National Youth Congress. Droughts and flooding in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan have destroyed farmland, killed livestock and forced millions from their homes. Thanks to our supporters we have helped communities with urgent supplies of food, water, and seeds resilient against climate change, and we will continue to respond for as long as we are needed. Coastal regions that are home to millions of people have already been irreversibly damaged by climate change, including from rising sea levels and salination of water. Following floods in Pakistan, we supported mobile health clinics that travelled hundreds of miles to treat people in need of medical help. Generous donations to our [Harvest Appeal](/give/appeals/harvest-appeal) will allow us to reach even more people affected by the climate crisis in 2024. In October [we delivered ‘Salina’s letter’ to the World Bank’s UK offices](/news/campaigning-news/salina-s-letter-delivered-to-world-bank). Salina is a small-holder farmer from Bangladesh who is fighting to keep control of her own seeds. Part of CAFOD’s ongoing [Fix the Food System](/campaign/fix-the-food-system) campaign, the letter was signed by 18 Catholic Bishops and over 70,000 Catholics from 750 parishes across England and Wales. The [publication of Pope Francis’ Laudate Deum](/pray/laudate-deum-explained) was a rallying cry to phase out fossil fuels and to care for our common home. More than 3,000 CAFOD campaigners joined Pope Francis, writing to MPs, joining climate marches and signing petitions urging Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to stick to the UK’s climate commitments. At COP28, for the first time [international governments pledged to phase down fossil fuels](/news/campaigning-news/cop28-un-climate-talks-end-with-agreement-to-transition-away-from-fossil-fuels) and establish a loss and damage fund to help vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change. In 2024 we will continue to advocate for a cleaner, more just world. CAFOD is working with our local partners to support those in the hardest-hit frontline areas of the east and south this winter. Their experienced local staff are providing families and individuals in crisis with emergency accommodation, food, water, basic home repairs and medical assistance, alongside mental health support and employment counselling. 2023 will no doubt be remembered for the terrible death and destruction over the last few months in Gaza and Israel, and what can appear to be the end of hopes for peace in the region. But as we join calls for an urgent and permanent ceasefire, we pray that our local partners will soon be able to restart their programmes - from delivering life-saving medical outreach services for vulnerable communities in Gaza, to working tirelessly for peace and a political solution to the crisis. The terrible situation in Gaza is tearing lives apart. Your donation today will help with the practical support to help where possible. A prayer for people suffering due to the conflict in Gaza and Israel. Email David Cameron to call for peace and urge the UK to play its part in upholding international law. The challenges are set to continue into 2024, with the UN predicting increased displacement, conflict and the continued impact of climate change. As people of hope, we take heart in our ability to come together as a faith community to stand in solidarity with vulnerable communities. As we look to the new year ahead we thank everyone again for their continued support and wish you a peaceful festive break.",
