    "text": "Bryce Young comments on confidence in Panthers’ remade offensive line The [Carolina Panthers](https://www.si.com/nfl/team/carolina-panthers) did everything they could to set Bryce Young up for success in year two. In just a couple of days we will finally get the chance to see if Carolina's investment in their offensive line and skill position players can rejuvenate the career of the once heralded quarterback prospect that the franchise mortgaged their future for last winter. His first test at improving on his disastrous rookie year is a stiff one. The Panthers will [head south to New Orleans for a pivotal divisonal matchup in week one](https://www.panthers.com/news/know-your-foe-new-orleans-saints-carolina-panthers-chase-young-taysom-hill-bryce-young). In two matchups versus the Saints last season, Young was sacked eight times. Cameron Jordan, Carl Granderson and company made a home in the Panthers backfield, shoving the patchwork Panthers offensive line straight into the lap of their svelte quarterback. The five-some of Ikem Ekwonu, Damien Lewis, Austin Corbett, Robert Hunt, and Taylor Moton are determined to make sure that doesn't happen again. The man they have been tasked with protecting, Bryce Young, [is über confident in his stable of body guards](https://x.com/DNewtonespn/status/1831426643367186789) as they put the final touches on their preparations for their opening salvo of 2024. \"Last year is last year. We have a ton of respect for their defense, their defensive line, the players on their team. They have really good players. For me, I have all of the confidence in the world in my offensive line. I have a ton of confidence in the scheme we have, the guys up front, and everyone who is a part of the pass pro(tection) game. I have all of the confidence in the world in them and my job is to execute the calls as they are.\" The play of the offensive line and the requisite improvements that Young makes due to that improvement are the keys to the Carolina Panthers success in 2024 and beyond. Competency up front will lead to everything on the offense; the quarterback, the receivers, the running backs, etc. being more successful. They man they have been tasked to protect believes in them, and the world at large will get to see if that belief is well-founded in just a few days time.",

    "text": "Business News of Thursday, 15 August 2024 Source: [www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php) The Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana has bemoaned the poor implementation of the second phase of the Planting for Food and Jobs programme. According to the Executive Director of PFAG, Bismark Owusu Nortey, the government under the PFJ programme promised to support farmers with the provision of land preparation services, mechanization, extension, harvesting and marketing services in addition to all input support including seeds, fertilizers, agrochemicals. However, after several months of the launch, the farmers say none of these have been provided. “To even make matters worse for the PFJ 2.0, there are several emerging issues that contradicts the original intent of the program, which we now believe is more politically motivated than a genuine intervention to provide relief for farmers. The abysmal registration process, characterized by several challenges made it difficult and demotivating for farmers to register. “There is a lack of adequate extension officers to collect farmers’ data, inadequate logistics (tablets and motorbikes) to facilitate movement and bad timing of the process,” Nortey mentioned in a press conference on August 15, 2024. It is in this light that he noted that if the government does not act swiftly, food prices may deepen and cause hardships in the country. “The multi-burden of poor implementation of the PFJ 2.0, high input costs and low rainfall have the potential to derail farmers’ efforts and deepen the food crises currently experienced. The government, must as a matter of urgency, address the challenges with the PFJ 2.0 implementation for farmers and also deploy an emergency irrigation support scheme to provide water to recover what is left of the crops. Additional support to affected farmers to recover and rebuild is non-negotiable,” he added. He concluded that “Farmers are suffering and if farmers are suffering, Ghanaians will also suffer. Help the Ghanaian farmer and save the Ghanaian economy.” SSD/NOQ Watch the video Watch the latest edition of BizTech below: Ghana’s leading digital news platform, GhanaWeb, in conjunction with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, is embarking on an aggressive campaign which is geared towards ensuring that parliament passes comprehensive legislation to guide organ harvesting, organ donation, and organ transplantation in the country.

    "text": "The Pope could reportedly resign if his health worsens as fears rise over his well-being after the Italian Prime Minister visited him in hospital amid a battle with pneumonia.\nThe former Vatican Minister of Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, said: ‘There is no doubt that the Pope could decide to resign if he found himself in a situation in which his ability to have direct contact with people and to communicate in an immediate, incisive and decisive manner was compromised.\n‘Until now, the Pope has chosen to continue his activity even when he has had knee problems, for example.\n‘On that occasion, he said the famous phrase that one governs with the mind and not with the knee. The Pope has always had a tendency to fight and react,’ he told Italian radio station Rtl.\nIt comes after the Vatican issued an update on Pope Francis’s health, revealing that he is alert and got out of bed to eat breakfast this morning as he battles pneumonia.\nREAD MORE",
