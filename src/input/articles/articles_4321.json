    "text": "LINCOLN COUNTY, Ore. — Oregon Health Authority (OHA) has lifted the recreational use health advisory issued for Eckman Lake in Lincoln County. OHA issued the advisory Sept. 17. Water monitoring has confirmed that the level of saxitoxin in Eckman Lake is below recreational guideline values for people, OHA said. However, levels detected are still above OHA’s educational guideline values for dogs, and owners should keep their pets away from these areas. OHA advises recreational visitors to continually be alert to signs of cyanobacteria blooms. This is because blooms can develop and disappear on any water body at any time when bloom conditions are favorable. Only a fraction of water bodies in Oregon are monitored for blooms and toxins, so it’s important for people to become familiar with signs of a bloom, exposures and symptoms by visiting OHA’s [Cyanobacteria (Harmful Algae) Blooms website](http://www.healthoregon.org/hab). \"When recreating, people and especially small children and pets should avoid areas where the water is foamy, scummy, thick like paint, pea-green or blue-green, or if thick brownish-red mats are visible or bright green clumps are suspended in the water,\" OHA says. \"If you see these signs, avoid activities that cause you to swallow water or inhale droplets, such as swimming or high-speed water activities, and keep pets out of the area.\" Cyanotoxins can still exist in clear water. When a bloom dies, toxins released may reach into clear water around the bloom. Blooms can be pushed into other areas, leaving behind the toxins released. There also are species of cyanobacteria that anchor themselves at the bottom of a water body, live in the sediment, or can grow on aquatic plants and release toxins into clear water. For health information or to report an illness, contact OHA at 971-673-0482, or visit OHA’s [Cyanobacteria (Harmful Algae) Blooms website](http://www.healthoregon.org/hab).",

    "text": "‘Law & Order’ Actor Says John Wayne Gacy Assaulted Him In 1978 At the time of his arrest, John Wayne Gacy had raped, tortured, and killed at least 33 young men around the Chicago area. Known as the “Killer Clown” because he worked as a children’s clown at the time, he remains one of the most notorious serial killers in American history. In a recent interview, an actor who has appeared on shows like Law & Order has admitted that he was one of Gacy’s sexual assault victims but made it out of the experience alive. Here is what you need to know. Jack Merrill Says John Wayne Gacy Raped Him At Gunpoint Actor Jack Merrill said in a recent interview that John Wayne Gazy sexually assaulted him at gunpoint in 1978. He said that this happened just seven months before Gacy was arrested and charged with 33 murders . Merrill also said that he had no idea he was a serial killer during the assault. According to Merrill, he was walking home from the YMCA in Chicago in 1978 when Gacy drove up and offered him a ride (via PEOPLE ). Merrill said he accepted the ride, but then things went bad. Gacy pulled over and asked Merrill if he had ever done “poppers.” “Poppers” is inhaling amyl nitrite to get high. Gacy pulled out the bottle, splashed liquid on it, and put it on Merrill’s face. He said that he woke up a little while later, and he was in handcuffs inside Gacy’s house. Merrill said he was a smaller guy and did what he could not to anger his abductor. Merrill said he tried to “diffuse” the situation, so Gacy took off the handcuffs, and they drank beer and smoked pot together. However, the killer wasn’t finished and attacked Merrill again and handcuffed him one more time. How Did Jack Merrill Escape John Wayne Gacy? “He put this homemade contraption around my neck. It had ropes and pulleys, and it went around my back and through my handcuffed hands in a way that if I struggled, I would choke. I did at one point and started to lose air,” Merrill remembered. Merrill said Gacy then put a gun in his mouth and then sexually assaulted him in the bedroom. “I knew if I fought him, I didn’t have much of a chance,” Merrill said. “I never freaked out or yelled; I also felt sorry for him in a way, like he didn’t necessarily want to be doing what he was doing, but he couldn’t stop.” Because he didn’t fight it, Gacy agreed to take him home after the assault. Merrill said he didn’t know Gacy was the serial killer terrorizing the city, so he didn’t call the police and just tried to put things behind him. Jack Merrill went on to become a successful character actor. He appeared on three episodes of Law & Order , two episodes of Grey’s Anatomy, and three episodes of Games People Play, among others.

    "title": "Roaring Fork Transportation Authority bus drivers’ union threatens strike",
    "text": "A bus drivers’ union is threatening to go on strike against its employer, the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority.\nThe Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1774 just announced a 40-day notice to strike due to an impasse in contract negotiations with the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority. The local bus system is the second largest of its kind in Colorado behind Denver’s Regional Transit District, as well as the largest rural transit agency in the U.S.\nThe Roaring Fork Transportation Authority currently has about 160 bus drivers.\nATU President Ed Cortez said that the union has to give 40 days’ notice by law to strike. The notice was submitted to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.\n“We have reached an impasse and decided that RFTA’s last best offer was not very good,” Cortez told The Aspen Times on Thursday morning. “We are certainly disappointed that the negotiations between ATU and RFTA have come to an impasse and we are moving ahead according to procedure put out by the Colorado Department of Labor.”\nPeople wait for a Roaring Fork Transportation Authority bus at Rubey Park Transit Center in Aspen on Thursday. Ray K. Erku/The Aspen Times New Roaring Fork Transportation Authority bus drivers currently make $30.60 per hour. Drivers who work seven years or more are bumped up to $38.76 an hour. The current rates come from a previous 17% pay increase for full-time drivers in 2022 and 2023 under former CEO Dan Blankenship.\nNew RFTA CEO Kurt Ravenschlag, however, proposed during recent negotiations — the parties convened for formal bargaining in July and September — increasing driver base pay to $31.05 per hour, and the maximum wage rate to $40 per hour. The union rejected the offer, arguing the rates don’t align with cost of living in the valley.\n“Yesterday, the company gave us their ‘final’ wage proposal — an across the board increase of under 3% over three years. Since 2021, inflation has raised the cost of living by over 16%, to say nothing of increased housing costs in our communities,” Cortez stated in a Wednesday, Sept. 11 letter to his union obtained by The Aspen Times. “While RFTA sits on over $100 million in cash, it has told us to sit down and be grateful for table scraps.”\nCortez went on to say “we are standing firm in our demand for fair wages that exceed inflation,” with the union calling to increase pay for longtime employees $46.41 per hour, as well as “a housing stipend of $800 a month, more equitable overtime opportunities, a run board bidding system, a fair attendance policy that RFTA can’t change on a whim, more unpaid leave, and an end to Alert Meter,” as well as a requirement that the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority has to negotiate when making future changes to work-related operations.\nAlso during recent negotiations, the union rejected the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority’s proposed wage increases of up to 9% for the first year of employment, and then 6% wage increases per year, for the remaining two years of the contract.\nFor drivers at the maximum wage, they would get a bonus equivalent to 2% of their annual base salary, every year for three years and their max base wage would increase by 1% every year for the three years of the contract.\nA Roaring Fork Transportation Authority bus schedule at Rubey Park Transit Center in Aspen on Thursday. Ray K. Erku/The Aspen Times Previous reporting by the Aspen Times stated that the ATU proposed that housing costs should not exceed 30% of drivers’ income and has suggested a housing stipend. Cortez admitted these proposals were intended to spark substantive deliberations, but RFTA’s response has been dismissive.\n“RFTA respects the union’s position and is committed to achieving an outcome that minimizes disruption to the vital services our customers rely on,” Ravenschlag said in a prepared statement on Thursday. “We also want to acknowledge and value the contributions of our Bus Operators, while also responsibly managing the community tax dollars that fund our essential services.”\nAccording to the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority, it expects a decision from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment within 20 days on whether they will allow the union to strike.\n“If denied, the parties will be ordered to arbitrate,” according to the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority. “If the strike is approved, RFTA is already working on contingency plans to minimize service disruptions and plans to keep the public updated.”",

    "text": "El gobernador de\nTexas, el republicano Greg Abbott, ha desafiado al Tribunal Supremo de Estados Unidos al ordenar que la Guardia Nacional texana mantenga el alambre de púas que colocó en la frontera con México para disuadir la entrada de migrantes.\n\"Texas tiene el derecho constitucional a defenderse\", argumentó este jueves en una entrevista con Fox News, en la que acusó al presidente de Estados Unidos, el demócrata\nJoe Biden, de haber \"abdicado su responsabilidad\" de proteger la frontera.\nPor ello, el republicano defendió la instalación de más \"barreras\" que impidan la entrada a los migrantes, a los que considera unos \"delincuentes\".\nEl pasado lunes,\nel Supremo dio la razón al Gobierno federal para que pueda retirar el alambre de púas que las autoridades texanas colocaron en un tramo de la frontera en Eagle Pass para frenar a los migrantes.\nLa Administración de Biden alega que la barrera de espino impide a los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza federal acceder al área y desempeñar sus funciones.\nEn respuesta a la decisión del alto tribunal, Abbott declaró el miércoles la existencia de una \"invasión\" en Texas, lo que a su juicio otorga a su Gobierno \"la autoridad constitucional de defender\" al estado.\nInstalará más\nEn un comunicado, el gobernador aseguró que la Guardia Nacional texana y la Policía estatal actuarán \"bajo esta autoridad\" para \"proteger la frontera de Texas\" y, según medios locales, siguen los trabajos de instalación de más alambre de púas.\nLa Guardia Nacional texana patrulla desde hace tiempo la frontera, lo que ha provocado roces con las autoridades federales.\nEl pasado 12 de enero se vivió un punto máximo de tensión cuando agentes federales acusaron a las autoridades texanas de haberles impedido el acceso al área para rescatar a una familia de tres migrantes que se ahogó en el río Bravo.\nAdemás de la colocación del alambre de púas y el despliegue de la Guardia Nacional, Abbott ha enviado decenas de buses con migrantes a Washington y a varias otras ciudades gobernadas por demócratas como parte de su enfrentamiento con las políticas de Biden.\nTambién instaló una polémica barrera de boyas en un tramo del río Bravo e impulsó una ley para criminalizar a los migrantes que cruzan de forma irregular la frontera, ambas medidas muy criticadas por el presidente de México,\nAndrés Manuel López Obrador.",
