    "text": "MoMo Productions\nWhat:\nSemaglutide, a highly popular medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat obesity and manage type 2 diabetes, was associated with a 49% to 73% lower risk of first-time or recurring suicidal ideations compared to other medications for controlling obesity and type 2 diabetes that work via different mechanisms. These findings provide evidence that semaglutide – which helps regulate appetite and insulin levels by targeting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors (GLP1R) in the body – does not appear to increase the risk of suicidal ideation, contrary to the claims of some anecdotal reports. Published today in Nature Medicine, and paired with\na related Research Briefing, the study was co-led by scientists at Case Western Reserve University and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health.\nOutside of anecdotal and case reports, this association had not yet been explored by comprehensive studies. Recently, patients prescribed the medication for obesity (brand name Wegovy) or type 2 diabetes (brand name Ozempic), have anecdotally reported suicidal ideations resulting from semaglutide, and this has spurred\nEuropean regulatory agencies to investigate this potential association.\nResearchers examined electronic health records in the United States from 240,618 patients who were obese or overweight (mean age 50 years, 72.6% women) and who were prescribed semaglutide or another medication for weight loss between June 2021 and December 2022. Among this group, 232,771 patients did not have a prior history of suicidal ideation and 7,847 patients did. The researchers also replicated the findings in 1,589,855 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 58 years, 49.2% women) who were prescribed either semaglutide or other medications for their condition between December 2017 and May 2021. This group included 1,572,885 patients without and 16,970 patients with a prior history of suicidal ideations. For each study population, the semaglutide groups and the non-GLP1R groups had similarly matched demographic characteristics, medical history, problems with lifestyle, mental and substance use disorders, and prior suicidal ideation and behavior.\nTracking the patients’ medical histories through six months after they were prescribed medication, the researchers found people prescribed semaglutide for weight loss had a 0.11% risk of first-time suicidal ideations (among those without a prior history) and approximately a 7% risk of recurrent suicidal ideation (among those with a prior history), compared to 0.43% and 14%, respectively, for the group prescribed other weight loss medications.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide prescription was associated with 0.13% risk of first-time suicidal ideations and 10% for recurrent ideation, compared to 0.36% and 18%, respectively, for other diabetes medications. Compared with other medications, semaglutide was also associated with a lower risk of first-time suicidal ideation in patients with type 2 diabetes at longer follow-up durations (up to three years).\nThe authors concluded that their results do not support concerns of increased suicidal risk associated with semaglutide and highlight the need for a more detailed evaluation of reported cases to date. They recommend future studies evaluate potential longer-term associations of semaglutide with suicidal ideations in patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes – as well as in other at-risk populations – and explore any associations between semaglutide and suicide attempts.\nThe paper’s authorship was also supported by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Cancer Institute at the NIH.\nArticles\n- R Xu, et al.\nAssociation of semaglutide with risk of suicidal ideations in a real-world cohort.

In 2022, nearly 49 million people in the United States had at least one substance use disorder. Substance use disorders are defined in part by continued use of substances despite negative consequences. They are also relapsing conditions, in which periods of abstinence (not using substances) can be followed by a return to use. Stigma can make individuals with substance use disorders less likely to seek treatment.

    "text": "In a\nrecent story from CNN, former Brigham Young University distance runners Conner Mantz and Clayton Young spoke about how the gospel of Jesus Christ has impacted their journey in qualifying for the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games.\n“If only my identity is as a runner or making this Olympic team, it can be very debilitating,” Clayton shared.\nThe friends have pursued the goal of making it to the Olympics for almost seven years, running more than 10,000 miles together. Clayton’s personal marathon record is two hours and eight minutes, while Connor’s record is two hours, seven minutes, and 47 seconds.\nBefore meeting in college in 2017, they both served as full-time missionaries for the Church—with Clayton sharing the gospel in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Conner serving in the Ghana Accra West mission.\nOn February 3, the friends placed first and second at the 2024 US Olympic Team Marathon Trials. To prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games this summer, Clayton plans to compete in the New York City Half Marathon on March 17, while Conner focuses on recovering from a minor injury.\nThrough the whirlwind of preparing for the Olympics, the friends say their friendship has become deeply supportive and motivating. “We’re able to learn from one another when we’re not running, and then when we are running, we’re able to push each other,” Conner shared.\nClayton agreed, commenting that even when things get competitive, they try to remind themselves that they’re “better together.”\nUltimately, he feels that their faith has helped expand their abilities and keep them centered on what’s most important:\n“Through our canonized faith, we’ve realized that we’re more than just a couple of runners, we’re more than just professional athletes. We’re husbands, I’m a father, and we’re ultimately sons of God.\n“It definitely has contributed to our running because that eternal perspective is really what grounds us. Racing is important and making an Olympic team is obviously a once in a lifetime thing, but there is more to this life than running.”\nRead more about Conner Mantz and Clayton Young’s journey to the 2024 Paris Olympic Summer Games.\n▶You may also like:\nFormer BYU runners smash the US Olympic Marathon Trials",

    "text": "Visitors often say that my house would not look out of place in an interiors magazine.\nIn fact, the beautiful three-bedroom house in the Cotswolds is my pride and joy, and will eventually become my pension fund.\nYou might think I’m completely crazy for letting strangers in and having to stay close by at my mum’s house, but the £4,000 a week I get paid through Airbnb sweetens the deal quite a bit.\nStill, that’s not to say that renting my home to paying guests doesn’t have its drawbacks.\nAs a friend told me four years ago when I first started hosting, if people pay to stay in my home, they will use it as they see fit.\nIn my experience, guests are either a total dream or a total nightmare.\n“Some families are amazing, but I can safely say that changing sheets can be a scary experience. I always wear latex gloves for this.”\nI have received very nice feedback from visitors, who exclaim “What a wonderful host and what a special house!”. I am not at all surprised. I like to think that I go the extra mile; I do everything from answering the initial enquiry email to welcoming my guests personally. I am available outside of working hours for anything they might need and I do general cleaning myself after they have left (but more on that later).\nSo when guests abuse my home, I take it personally. I’m not a fancy businessman with a bunch of rental properties – this is my home and my livelihood.\nI’ve traveled all over the world, and whenever I’ve stayed in people’s homes as an Airbnb guest, I’ve always treated them with respect. Naively, I expected people to do the same with my home, but I quickly got rid of that idea.\nAfter a family stayed, I went in to clean up and was initially happy to see that my house was left in a seemingly spotless state.\nThat was until I discovered a gruesome colony of snot that a child had spread on one of the beds. It had hardened and I had to resort to removing it with my bare hands.\nAnd that’s not even the worst of bodily fluids. Take for example the man who left all my hand towels so hard they could be smashed with a hammer. They went straight into the trash. And there’s no doubt that changing sheets can be a creepy experience. For this, I always wear latex gloves.\nOn another occasion, the master bedroom was flooded because the bathroom door had been left open. The guest who was leaving claimed that he had left the window open and that the rain had come in. The costs incurred were deducted from the guest’s deposit, which he eventually admitted.\nA businessman left a frying pan on in the kitchen and the neighbors called me because the smoke alarm went off.\nSome guests are really strange. I’m thinking of the man who threw all his socks and underwear in the trash at the end of his stay. I use translucent trash bags so I know what’s consumed in my house. I still have no idea why he did it.\nWhen the guests leave, I get straight to cleaning. I do this myself, as it’s very difficult to find a professional cleaner at every turn. I make sure I’m quick, as a quick check usually means I can catch things that have been forgotten before they’ve gone too far.\nA guest left a classic car in the driveway after checking out. That’s a pretty big loss. But when I sheepishly told him that he had forgotten his vehicle, he told me that he had always planned to pick it up the next day after his stay was over. Thanks for asking!\n‘Luckily, Airbnb gives me the option to not accept ‘instant bookings,’ where guests can book their stay without my permission.’\nIn a dream world, people would be shaved from head to toe before crossing my threshold. The shower drain is the worst. I resign myself to having to pick out hairballs the size of rats as part of my routine. It’s a pretty intense workout.\nUsed condoms on the lawn, nail clippings in a neat pile under the couch — I’ve seen it all. I’ve dumped expressed breast milk that was in a Ziploc bag into the refrigerator and nearly screamed at the sight of what I thought was a small mammal that had died behind the couch. It turned out to be a pile of discarded hair extensions.\nAll this despite the fact that I have done extensive research before allowing people to stay. Fortunately, Airbnb gives me the option to not accept “instant bookings,” where guests can book their stay without my permission. And I am refurbishing a garden room so I can stay on site in the future while guests stay, so I can keep a closer eye on them.\nI’m very picky. First, I look at other hosts’ reviews. If they don’t have all-positive reviews (or none at all), then I say “no.”\nTo be honest, I turn away more tourists than I accept. No pets, no parties, no barbecues, and smoking is strictly prohibited.\nIf they’re not clear on why they want to book, I ask them to the point that CIA interrogators would be proud of. I want to know exactly why they’re visiting my area. Who are the participants? How old are they? When will they check in and when will they check out? I want a profile of who will be staying, and I don’t think that’s too much to ask. I’m more than willing to go back and forth until they convince me that they’re not going to trash my house, though of course you can never be sure. It takes me a long time to hit the “confirm” button.\nBut don’t be nervous around hosts like me. We’re not hotel managers; these are our homes, which we love and have worked hard to build. People get exasperated by my questions and have accused me of being too nosy. But what are you trying to hide? Besides, if I know more about you, I can be a much more helpful host.\nI’m not even too strict with the rules. My requests are totally reasonable. Close the windows, turn off everything (don’t forget the coffee machine!). You’d be surprised how many people go out for a walk with the place lit up like a Christmas tree.\nOf course, one gets complaints (one visitor was furious that he didn’t have a knife sharpener at home), and I treat the whiners and curmudgeons who leave a bad review with a carefully worded response, sending them firmly back to their mailbox.\nAt the end of the day, if you don’t like my rules, then you know what to do. You can I’m on vacation, but this is my home.\nAs told to Samantha Brick\n(tags to translate)dailymail",
