    "text": "RICHMOND — Democrats are off to a head start in fundraising for Virginia’s busy campaign season, with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D) reporting a big cash lead over Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) in the race for governor and Democrats outraising Republicans overall in contests for 100 seats in the House of Delegates, according to campaign finance reports filed this week.\nSpanberger reported raising $6.7 million during the first three months of the year as of a midnight Tuesday state filing deadline — more than double the $3.1 million raised by Earle-Sears, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project.\nEarle-Sears’s fundraising was restricted at the start of the year because she was not allowed to raise money during the General Assembly session, which ran from Jan. 8 through Feb. 22, as she presided over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor. The Republican ended the quarter with a little over $4 million in cash on hand, while Spanberger finished the period with just over $11 million in the bank.\nThe already astronomical totals reflect the outsize attention aimed at the Virginia gubernatorial race, which is always a barometer for political sentiment following a presidential election but carries extra freight this year. Democrats are hoping to make a strong stand against the Trump administration while Republicans look to extend their brand in a purple state, all with a historic contest that virtually ensures Virginia will have its first female governor. If Earle-Sears were to win, she would be the first African American woman to lead any state.\nHere are highlights from the campaign-finance filings:\nBig-money donors\nOut-of-state billionaires opened their wallets for both gubernatorial candidates along with homegrown, high-dollar donors such as unions and coal barons.\nSpanberger’s two largest contributors were VoteVets Federal PAC ($500,000) and the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Working Families Fund ($250,000).\nA handful of California billionaires donated $100,000 to her campaign, including Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer, heiress of Cargill, one of the world’s largest commodities traders, and LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman. Elizabeth Simons, daughter of hedge fund billionaire James Simons and chairwoman of the Heising-Simons Foundation, also gave $100,000. So did her husband, hedge fund manager Mark Heising.\nEarle-Sears’s largest donor was Thomas Peterffy, a national GOP megadonor and Florida resident who donated $3 million to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC in 2023 as he publicly called on Youngkin (R) to enter the 2024 presidential race. Peterffy gave $300,000 to Earle-Sears — and $1 million to Youngkin’s PAC, bringing his total contributions to Spirit of Virginia to $4 million.\nPeterffy, the world’s 27th-richest person, according to Forbes, which put his net worth at $57.3 billion in March, declined to comment through a spokeswoman.\nOther major donors to Earle-Sears include billionaire Earl Gentry Kendrick Jr., founder of Datatel and managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, who gave $150,000. Richard Baxter Gilliam, a southwest Virginia coal magnate who has donated about $7 million to Virginia Republicans over the past two decades, gave her $100,000. Former California congressman and U.S. House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R) donated $50,000.\nNational prospects\nYoungkin’s PAC raised $1.9 million and ended the quarter with about $1.6 million in the bank. The term-limited governor could tap the PAC to help Republicans in Virginia this year or transfer the money to a PAC supporting his potential 2028 presidential bid, which he has been mulling since taking a pass on the 2024 race. Republicans’ performance in the fall could be critical to Youngkin’s national prospects.\nAside from Peterffy, the PAC’s biggest donors were: Tiger Lily Capital, a Charlottesville financial services outfit, which donated $150,000; Arkansas poultry magnate Ronald Cameron, who gave $100,000; and Rooney Holdings, an international investment company based in Florida, which also gave $100,000.\nDown ballot\nIn the Republican race for lieutenant governor, Pat Herrity, a member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, raised $540,273 and headed into April with $335,067 in the bank. His lone rival for the nomination, Richmond talk-radio host John Reid, raised $178,110 and ended the quarter with $90,990 on hand.\nIn the six-way Democratic primary, former Richmond mayor Levar Stoney raised the most: $428,802, leaving him with $522,501 in the bank at the end of March. Babur B. Lateef, chairman of the Prince William County School Board, raised $398,269 and had $381,392 on hand.\nTwo of their rivals are state legislators who were barred from fundraising during the 46-day General Assembly session: state Sen. Aaron R. Rouse (Virginia Beach), who raised $399,319 and ended the period with $925,949 in cash; and state Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi (Richmond), who raised $305,871 and had $655,869 in the bank. Union leader and attorney Alex J. Bastani raised $134,137 and headed into April with $33,046. No new report was available for former federal prosecutor Victor Salgado, who had $78,336 in the bank at the end of December.\nIn the race for attorney general, incumbent Jason S. Miyares (R), who is unchallenged for the GOP nomination, raised $1.5 million and had $2.1 million on hand. Two Democrats are vying to take on Miyares in November. Former Norfolk delegate Jerrauld C. “Jay” Jones raised $931,242 and had nearly $1.5 million in the bank. Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor raised $534,275 and had $666,324 on hand.\nBig-money speaker\nIn House of Delegates fundraising, there’s House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and then there’s everybody else — literally. Scott’s total of $813,254 raised for the quarter is greater than the combined amount of the next five best-funded House candidates around the state. With nearly $2.5 million in his war chest, Scott is running unopposed, so he will be able to share some of those riches with other Democrats in key races.\nHis top donor for the period was Dominion Energy, which gave $100,000 and has long been the most generous benefactor to leaders of both major parties. Scott’s other major contributors included state auto dealers and several casino interests.\nBlue push for the green\nOverall, the $3.7 million raised by Democratic House candidates was more than double the $1.5 million total raised by Republicans for the three months, according to VPAP. The gap narrows when it comes to cash on hand — Democratic candidates have a total of a little more than $9.3 million; Republicans have almost $6.5 million.\nDemocrats hold a 51-49 majority in the House of Delegates and are hoping anti-Trump fervor will help them pick up a few more seats; the last time Donald Trump was in the White House, Democrats made stunning gains and took their first House majority in a generation. This year, Democratic candidates are running in 91 of the 100 House districts, while Republicans are fielding candidates in 66 districts.\nAfter Scott, the next four top House fundraisers in VPAP’s analysis are also Democrats. Candidate Lily Franklin came in second with $190,338 as she runs in a rematch with incumbent Del. Chris Obenshain (R) in the red-leaning House District 41, which is between Roanoke and Blacksburg in the western part of the state. Franklin, who has $243,466 in cash on hand, came within less than 1 percent of beating Obenshain when they ran in 2023. The Republican reported raising $50,180 for this year’s first quarter and has $88,743 in the bank.\nIn third place was Democrat John McAuliff with $170,820 raised for the three months in his challenge to GOP incumbent Geary M. Higgins in House District 30 in Loudoun County. Higgins reported raising $38,336 for the quarter, but his cash on hand of about $168,000 is greater than McAuliff’s war chest of about $141,000.\nHouse Majority Leader Charniele L. Herring (D-Alexandria) came in fourth with a three-month haul of $165,265 as she runs unopposed, and rounding out the top five was former delegate Elizabeth Guzman (D), who raised $149,043 during the quarter as she tries for a comeback after two years out of office. With $114,100 in the bank, she is running in House District 22 in Prince William County against Republican incumbent Del. Ian T. Lovejoy, whose latest report was not yet available but who had about $26,000 on hand at the start of the year.\nThat district is one of at least eight Republican-held seats that went for Vice President Kamala Harris in last fall’s presidential election, according to a VPAP analysis, creating obvious targets for Democrats in what is expected to be a blue-trending year.\nNational targets\nThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee this month announced a seven-figure ad buy and highlighted four closely divided districts held by Democrats that are among the national organization’s priorities. In those four districts, Democrats outraised Republicans by a combined total of $296,013 to $191,963, according to VPAP’s numbers.\nIn one of those close races, though — House District 97 in Virginia Beach — GOP challenger and former delegate Tim Anderson outraised incumbent Del. Michael Feggans, posting $112,192 to the Democrat’s $60,265.",

    "text": "Latest Weather Blog Recall of nearly 5 million portable blenders under way for unsafe blades and dozens of burn injuries BlendJet is recalling about 4.8 million of its portable blenders over laceration and fire hazards after receiving dozens of reports of injuries, federal regulators said Thursday. BlendJet 2 Portable Blenders can overheat or catch fire, according to a notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and their blender blades can break off during use. There have been 329 reports of blades breaking during use to date, the CPSC said, as well as 17 additional reports of overheating or fires that resulted in about $150,000 of property damage claims. The company has also received 49 reports of minor burn injuries and one reported laceration injury. Regulators urged consumers to stop using the recalled blenders immediately and contact BlendJet for a free base unit replacement. To receive the replacement part, customers will need to remove and cut up the base’s rubber seal and email or upload a photo using BlendJet’s website. BlendJet said in a prepared statement that the recall impacts older Blender 2 blenders and that BlendJet 2 blenders now available for purchase through the company’s website and retail partners have updated components and are not subject to the recall. “Out of an abundance of caution, our company updated the base of the BlendJet 2 to feature thicker blades and an improved electrical configuration,” BlendJet wrote in a Thursday release. “These updates were incorporated many months ago into all BlendJet 2 devices manufactured by the company.” BlendJet 2 blenders with serial numbers that begin with numbers “5543” or higher are not under recall, the Benicia, California, company said. Consumers can also confirm whether or not their blender is under recall by furnishing product information on BlendJet’s website or contacting the company. Trending News According to the CPSC, the recalled BlendJet Portable Blenders were sold between October 2020 and November 2023 online and in stores at retailers including Costco, Walmart and Target. In addition the 4.8 million BlendJet 2 blenders under recall in the U.S., regulators say about 117,000 were sold in Canada.

    "text": "भारत में 14 लाख बच्चों का नहीं हुआ टीकाकरण, लैंसेट रिपोर्ट में चौंकाने वाला खुलासा; खसरा और पोलियो जैसी बीमारियां बढ़ने का खतरा\nदुनिया के साथ-साथ भारत में बच्चों के टीकाकरण को लेकर रिपोर्ट में खुलासा हुआ है कि विश्वभर में 1.57 करोड़ बच्चे हैं, जिनका वैक्सीनेशन नहीं हुआ है। इससे खसरा और पोलियो जैसी बीमारियों के बढ़ने का खतरा पैदा हो गया है।\nजेएनएन, डिजिटल डेस्क। भारत में 14 लाख बच्चे ऐसे थे, जिनको जीवन रक्षक डीटीपी वैक्सीन की एक भी डोज नहीं लगी। इस बात का खुलासा मेडिकल जर्नल लैंसेट की एक नई रिपोर्ट में हुआ है। रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, 2023 में दुनियाभर में 1.57 करोड़ बच्चों को ये वैक्सीन नहीं लगी और आधे से ज्यादा जीरो डोज बच्चे सिर्फ 8 देशों में हैं। इनमें भारत, पाकिस्तान, नाइजीरिया, ब्राजील, इंडोनेशिया, डेमोक्रेटिक रिपब्लिक ऑफ कॉन्गो, सूडान और सोमालिया शामिल हैं।\nरिपोर्ट की अगर मानें तो इन देशों में लंबे समय से स्वास्थ्य व्यवस्था के लिए निवेश में कमी, राजनीतिक अस्थिरता और शिक्षा की भी कमी बताई गई। टीकाकरण की दिशा में पिछले 50 सालों में प्रगति तो हुई है लेकिन अभी भी गहरी असमानता है। कोरोना महामारी, गलत जानकारी या सूचना और राजनीतिक इच्छाशक्ति की कमी ने इस प्रगति को धीमा या फिर उल्टा कर दिया।\nफिर पनपने लगेंगे खसरा, पोलियो जैसे रोग\nरिपोर्ट चेतावनी देती है कि अगर इस समस्या को दूर नहीं किया जाता है तो खसरा, पोलियो और डिप्थीरिया जैसी बीमारियां फिर से महामारी का रूप धारण कर सकती हैं। रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, 1980 में दुनिया में 5.88 करोड़ ऐसे बच्चे थे, जिन्हें बचपन में कोई भी टीका नहीं लगा। इनमें से पचास प्रतिशत से ऊपर बच्चे भारत, पाकिस्तान, चीन, इंडोनेशिया और बांग्लादेश से ही थे। हालांकि 2019 तक जीरो डोज बच्चों की संख्या गिरकर अब 1.47 करोड़ रह गई।\nकैसे पूरा होगा डब्ल्यूएचओ का टारगेट\nयूनाइडेट नेशन और डब्ल्यूएचओ का टारगेट है कि 2030 तक जीरो डोज बच्चों की संख्या को 2019 की तुलना में आधा किया जाए। वहीं, रिपोर्ट पर गौर करें तो अब तक ये टारगेट 204 देशों में से सिर्फ 18 देश ही पूरा कर पाए हैं। अफ्रीका और साउथ एशिया में ये संकट और भी गहरा है।\nटीकाकरण में गिरावट का क्या है कारण?\nबच्चों के टीकाकरण में गिरावट की सबसे बड़ी वजह रिपोर्ट में कोरोना महामारी को बताया गया है। रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, कोविड के बाद हेल्थ सिस्टम पर बोझ बढ़ा है और यही वजह है कि वैक्सीनेशन में भारी गिराटवट देखने को मिली। इसके अलावा सूडान और डीआर कांगो में राजनीतिक अस्थिरता और युद्ध भी एक वजह है। साथ ही टीकाकरण पर कम खर्चा या फिर इसको प्राथमिकता न देना भी वजहों में शामिल है।",
