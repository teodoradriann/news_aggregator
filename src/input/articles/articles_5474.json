    "title": "ACTA, CATO talk Air Canada strike threat as clock ticks louder",
    "text": "MISSISSAUGA — Both ACTA and CATO are calling for a quick resolution to yet another possible airline labour disruption next week.\nACTA President Wendy Paradis, who offered her take on Air Canada’s situation at the ACTA Summit yesterday in Toronto, says the airline’s leadership team has been proactive in working with ACTA to help keep travel advisors informed ahead of the strike threat.\n“We’re experiencing the third potential strike in transportation strike in three months in Canada,” said Paradis. “That creates havoc in our industry, and stress for every single person in this room. I just want to acknowledge the elephant in the room that we have a potential disruption in front of us.”\nLast week ACTA along with TIAC urged the federal government “to engage promptly in facilitating a resolution to avert another significant challenge facing the travel industry.”\nYesterday Paradis said that not only ACTA and TIAC, but also the Hotel Association of Canada, and the National Chamber of Commerce, “we are urging Air Canada, we are urging the union, and we are urging the federal government to work really hard together to come to a resolution.”\nParadis added: “Our message is: negotiate and come to a resolution as soon as possible. Do everything in your power for those three parties to come to a resolution.”\nShe went on to say that for the Air Canada team, everything that they’re aware of is on the airline’s travel advisor portal. “If you have not familiarized yourself with the portal, it’s really important that you do that, so that you can be the best travel advisor you can be to your clients. That’s where the most up to date information will be.”\nMeanwhile the advocates of the industry will continue to push all three parties for a resolution, she said.\nParadis added that whether it’s in Canada, the U.S. or Europe, “there are a lot of potential labor disruptions around the world pending over the next couple of years. So it’s really important that we are prepared and we are proactive, so that if these things happen, that we can take care of our travellers as much as possible.”\nCATO LENDS ITS SUPPORT\nThe Canadian Association of Tour Operators (CATO) also released a statement today, Sept. 13, to express its support for Air Canada’s recent appeal to the federal government to direct arbitration .\nSaid Jean Hébert, Executive Director: “As an organization representing a diverse range of tour operators across Canada, we recognize the critical role that Air Canada plays in facilitating travel both domestically and internationally. Any disruption in service could have significant repercussions not only for travellers, but also for the broader tourism industry, which relies heavily on the stability and reliability of air travel.”\nHébert added: “We urge the federal government to consider the importance of timely arbitration to ensure that travellers can continue to plan and enjoy their journeys without uncertainty. The tourism sector is a vital component of Canada’s economy, and it is essential that we work together to maintain its integrity and support the needs of all stakeholders involved.”",

    "text": "Santiago de Chile, 15 ago (EFECOM).- La huelga del Sindicato N°1 de Minera Escondida, la mina de cobre a cielo abierto en Chile que más produce en el mundo, cursa este jueves su tercer día y arriesga pérdidas diarias por 30 millones de dólares (27,3 millones de euros) según la empresa.\nPese a que ambas partes han manifestado su voluntad de retomar las negociaciones, no se ha llegado a un acuerdo respecto a las condiciones del diálogo.\nEn este contexto y sin avances concretos anunciados durante la jornada, los trabajadores de la empresa, propiedad de la multinacional con sede en Australia BHP Billiton, iniciaron la mañana de este jueves una acampada en Puerto Coloso, puerta de salida exclusiva del concentrado de cobre de Escondida que también alberga sus plantas desalinizadoras.\nTras la mediación por parte de la Dirección del Trabajo durante cinco días hábiles y el ofrecimiento de un bono de 27 millones de pesos (cerca de 29.000 dólares), las partes no lograron un acuerdo salarial y la huelga fue votada por el 99,8 % de los 2.379 socios sindicales, haciendo efectiva la paralización a partir del primer turno del pasado martes.\nLa decisión de los trabajadores obliga a paralizar una faena minera que representa cerca del 5 % de todo el cobre extraído a nivel global, dice la prensa local, interrumpiendo los envíos de BHP del metal rojo y aliviando presión sobre los precios que se han desplomado en los últimos meses.\nCon una producción de más de un millón de toneladas métricas al año, Minera Escondida, ubicada en la cordillera de la desértica región de Antofagasta, en el norte de Chile, es por amplia diferencia la mayor proveedora de cobre en el mundo.\nChile, que aglutina el 25 % de la producción mundial de cobre y donde operan gigantes como Codelco, BHP, Anglo American y Antofagasta Minerals, produce entre 5 y 6 millones de toneladas de cobre al año.\nLa minería representa cerca del 15 % del producto interior bruto (PIB) nacional.

    "text": "Gaza City [Israel], May 4 : Hamas has officially announced its intention to dispatch a delegation to Cairo in a bid to advance mediated negotiations. Leading the delegation will be Khalil al-Hayya, a prominent figure within the group, Al Jazeera reported.\nThe statement released by Hamas reiterated the organisation&apos;s positive stance towards the proposed negotiations.\n\"We are going to Cairo in the same spirit to reach an agreement. We in Hamas and the Palestinian resistance forces are determined to achieve an agreement that fulfils our people&apos;s demands for a complete cessation of the aggression, the withdrawal of the occupation forces, the return of the displaced, relief and reconstruction, and a serious exchange deal,\" a statement said, according to Al Jazeera.\nMeanwhile, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre conveyed Washington&apos;s apprehensions to Israel regarding potential major military operations in the southern city of Rafah. Jean-Pierre emphasised the importance of safeguarding the lives of civilians, particularly the 1.5 million individuals residing in Rafah.\n\"We want to make sure their lives are protected,\" Jean-Pierre stated during a press briefing. \"We believe the Israeli government is going to take our concerns into account.\"\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged both Israel and Hamas to prioritise reaching an agreement, citing the high stakes involved. In a post on X, Guterres emphasised the necessity of a negotiated settlement to prevent further escalation of the conflict.\n\"For the sake of the people of Gaza, the hostages and their families, and the region and the wider world - I strongly encourage the government of Israel and Hamas leadership to reach an agreement in their negotiations,\" Guterres posted on X.\nAccording to reports, at least 34,622 Palestinians have been killed and 77,867 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The death toll in Israel resulting from Hamas&apos;s October 7 attacks stands at 1,139, with numerous individuals still held captive, Al Jazeera reported.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

    "title": "Saskatoon moves to break with province on home energy efficiency standards | CBC News",
    "text": "A city council committee decision could mean home builders in Saskatoon facing stricter energy efficiency standards compared to the rest of the province.\nA report from city staff recommended Saskatoon return to a higher standard of energy efficiency building codes after the Saskatchewan government loosened province-wide regulations in April.\nOn Wednesday, the city's planning, development and community services committee voted in favour of the recommendation to regulate housing and small building energy efficiency standards above what's required by the province. City council will make the final decision.\nReverting to lower standards jeopardizes the city's goal to reduce Saskatoon's greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 and have all new homes net-zero by 2036, according to the report.\nBuying a home in Saskatoon is more expensive than ever Mayor Cynthia Block supported the move back to higher efficiency standards.\n\"I have no interest in rolling it back,\" Block said during the committee meeting. \"I'm glad that we'll be aligned with our low emissions community plan and foundationally, this will make it less expensive for homeowners.\"\nConstruction is regulated through provincial codes and acts, but municipalities are tasked with enforcing those regulations.\nThe city wants to return to the Tier 2 level in the system outlined in the National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings, which sets design and construction requirements for new buildings.\nIn January 2024, the province set Tier 2 as the minimum energy efficient standard for homes and small buildings. Earlier this year, the province announced it would revert to Tier 1 standards to lower development costs and encourage construction.\nThe city report stated Tier 2 requirements cost about an extra $1,000 to $3,000 per home compared to Tier 1, but the more energy-efficient homes save about $300 on bills annually.\nTariffs causing 'significant concern' for construction businesses in Saskatchewan\n3 months ago Duration 2:43 Shannon Frieson, CEO of the Construction Association of Saskatchewan, said tariffs are a significant concern for the construction industry, which she says contributes more than six per cent to the provincial GDP. Saskatoon and Region Home Builders' Association CEO Nicole Burgess said members are divided about what the city should do, but did raise concerns about creating two sets of regulations for home builders working in Saskatoon and outside of the city.\nRegulation isn't the only way to ensure energy efficiency standards, Burgess told the committee.\n\"Incentive programs and consumer demand can play a powerful role in encouraging the adoption of higher tiers,\" she said. \"This isn't about right and wrong, but it is about finding the right balance between thoughtful regulation and the realities of the market.\"\nTier 2 standards can improve energy efficiency by 10 per cent per household compared to Tier 1, or roughly the same as taking 274 cars off the road, according to the city report.\nWith committee approval, the recommendation will go to city council for a final decision.",
