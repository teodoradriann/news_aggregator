    "text": "Seven-time singles Grand Slam winner Venus Williams is single no more. Though long-rumored to be engaged to Andrea Preti, Venus subtly confirmed the news in an interview with WTA, Today reported. Following her first match in more than a year at the Mubadala Citi DC Open, Venus let the news slip. While she didn’t mention Andrea by name, it was pretty clear who she was talking about.\nVideos by InspireMore\n“My fiancé is here and he really encouraged me to keep playing,” she said.\nVenus Williams Wanted To Impress Andrea Preti\nVenus Williams told WTA having Andrea Preti in the stands helped motivate her to win.\n“There were so many times where I just wanted to coast and kind of chill,” she said. “Do you know how hard it is to play tennis? You guys don’t know how much work goes into this, like it’s 9 to 5 except you’re running the whole time, lifting weights, and just like dying, and then you repeat it the next day. So he encouraged me to get through this, and it’s wonderful to be here. He’s never seen me play.”\nEarly in July, Venus opened up to Today about her health struggles and stepping back from tennis.\n“Fibroids impacted my career,” she explained. “I never had enough energy most times to play a real match the way I wanted to, and, of course, it affected my results.”\nThankfully, she found a new team of doctors who helped her heal. Venus Williams opened up about her health, hoping to reach other women with similar struggles.\n“Hopefully someone will see this interview and say, ‘I can get help. I don’t have to live this way,’” Venus said. “I’m very passionate about this at this point in time because I know that other people can live better than what I lived.”\nThis story’s featured image is by Scott Taetsch/Getty Images.\nWant to be happier in just 5 minutes a day?

    "title": "Why Team Fight Tactics (TFT) Players Think Rageblade is Just Plain Boring",
    "text": "Team Fight Tactics (TFT) players are buzzing with opinions regarding the overwhelming dominance of Rageblade in the current meta. One particularly enthusiastic poster, under the name Desperate_Zebra_4085, launched a conversation that quickly snowballed into a hotbed of reactions. The game’s strategic depth and complex mechanics are ever-present, but many players are echoing a sentiment of dissatisfaction—decrying Rageblade as overly simplistic and claiming it has become a crutch item that stifles variety. As games are increasingly dictated by this item, players are clamoring for a breath of fresh air. Let’s dive into the chaotic opinions emerging from this discussion.\nSummary\n- Many players believe Rageblade is too essential and reflects a lack of diversity in build options.\n- Concerns arise that if Rageblade were removed, the game would struggle to provide adequate alternatives for carry items.\n- Some users express hope that future updates will shake up the current item meta.\n- While a majority finds Rageblade boring, there are a few voices suggesting certain compositions can work without it.\nThe Rageblade Dominance\nIt’s no secret that Rageblade has become the Swiss Army knife of items in TFT, almost a necessity for any serious competitor. Desperate_Zebra_4085 noted their experience in a single match: “I count 11 rageblades in this game lol,” emphasizing how ubiquitous the item has become. This is not just a castaway remark; it highlights a systemic issue where the strategic variety that is the lifeblood of TFT is being sucked dry. Players like BamsN1337 echo this sentiment by pointing out that success often hinges on whether you are able to secure Rageblade or not, which can feel like a double-edged sword. Instead of focusing on clever positioning or unique strategies, players may find themselves devoting their efforts to just securing the right item. Long-term players worry this trend is getting stale, and who doesn’t love a little chaos in their matches?\nThe Call for Diversity\nThe game thrives on its variety, but when players find themselves lulled into a snooze-fest of itemization, it’s time to raise the red flag. Commenters like SauceKingHS have expressed their views candidly: “Absolutely. Boring, repetitive, and disproportionately powerful at all stages of the game.” When a single item can dictate a player’s success from start to finish, it raises eyebrows and should spark a discussion. The core argument KrustyBuns943 presented provides an interesting point—without Rageblade, what would even replace it? This necessitates new item balance and design, ensuring that the picks in a game feel distinctive and exciting, rather than requiring players to fight over the same few options repeatedly. Some community voices lament the lack of viable alternatives, fearing the meta has become a one-trick pony where risk-taking only leads to defeat.\nFuture of TFT’s Itemization\nAs players look towards the future of TFT, they hope for patches that will disrupt the redundancy of Rageblade-centric builds. User disposableaccount848 hit the nail on the head, stating that the item being a “mandatory item for backline auto-attack carries” has been a determining factor in the game for far too long. It’s not merely the nostalgia of variety people crave; they want a game where every match feels different. The community seems to be clamoring for an overhaul, or at least some serious tweaks that can allow for a revitalized strategy discussion around non-Rageblade options. Some users came to the table with fresh perspectives; roogie15 pointed out that comps like Streetdemons and Vexotech actually don’t rely on Rageblade, suggesting that innovation can still happen and may open players’ eyes to other strategies. It’s a gentle reminder that while Rageblade might seem ubiquitous, it’s not the be-all and end-all.\nCommunity Sentiment and Emotional Investment\nCommunity feedback is often a mixed bag, rich with emotions ranging from indignation to genuine exasperation. Hannelore300 articulated a thought-provoking opinion, comparing the current state of Rageblade to previous iterations of other items in TFT. “You could say the same about Shojin,” they stated, urging a broader evaluation of the itemization landscape. But let’s face it; most of the chatter is largely dominated by the players who are ready to see Rageblade either heavily nerfed or completely redesigned. There’s an undeniable attachment to the strategic diversity that the game was once known for. Players feel a sense of ownership over the game; after all, they dedicate countless hours to mastering their crafts. If the meta grows stale, the emotional investment dwindles, leading to a gaming experience that feels far less rewarding. When these nuances are brushed aside, the community feels overlooked, as if their concerns are brushed off in favor of the status quo.\nAs the discussion around Rageblade continues to unfold, it is clear that a significant portion of the TFT community is searching for greater variety and excitement. With vocal criticism growing louder, developers may have their work cut out for them in shaking up the item ecosystem. A well-balanced game isn’t just about finding the cheapest path to victory; it’s also about allowing players to craft their unique moments of glory. The quest for balance and variety is ongoing, but one thing is clear: players are ready for more than just “Rageblade or bust.”",

She was known to pluck grapes from a bunch one at a time with her dexterous lips and had a funny habit of balancing snacks on the back of her paws to nibble at daintily.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Black bears can live for up to 30 years in the wild, but they typically die before reaching their 20s, according to the National Wildlife Federation.\nSuzie celebrated her 30th birthday in August, complete with presents and a towering cake of fresh fruit.\nThe park is located in Gray and overseen by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Formerly known as the Game Park, the site adopted the name \"Maine Wildlife Park\" in 1998 — three years after Suzie's arrival.\nThe park announced Suzie's death on Facebook shortly after noon and within hours, the post had garnered an outpouring of support, with commenters sharing condolences and memories of the beastly beauty.\n\"When I would go I would wave at her and she would come over and stand up like she was saying hi,\" one commenter said.\nCopy the Story Link\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 20,000 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "Solidaridad en Navidad: inolvidable agasajo a niños del merendero Caritas Felices\nEl espíritu navideño se vivió a pleno en Oberá, donde Daniel Benítez y Paola Antúnez organizaron, junto a un grupo de colaboradores, un emotivo festejo para los niños del merendero Caritas Felices. La jornada estuvo marcada por la alegría, las risas y los regalos que lograron llevar a los 45 niños que asisten al espacio, gracias a la solidaridad de quienes aportaron las donaciones, que fueron entregadas.\nDani y Paola, quienes comenzaron esta labor solidaria atendiendo a tan solo tres niños, hoy ven con orgullo cómo su iniciativa creció, debiendo entonces redoblar los esfuerzos. \"Agradecemos profundamente a todas las personas que nos ayudaron donando golosinas para este festejo\", expresó la pareja, exponiendo el verdadero significado de la Navidad: compartir, dar y unir corazones en favor de quienes más lo necesitan.\nLa celebración incluyó momentos de juegos, y, sobre todo, sonrisas de los pequeños, quienes recibieron con entusiasmo cada regalo y gesto de cariño. Pero la labor de Dani y Paola se extiende más allá de este agasajo navideño, ya que continúan recolectando juguetes y ropa para seguir ayudando a las familias que forman parte del merendero.\n\"Sabemos que muchos tienen cosas en sus casas que ya no usan, y para nosotros pueden ser la alegría de un niño. Invitamos a todos a sumarse\", comentaron. Aquellos interesados en colaborar con esta noble causa pueden comunicarse con la pareja a los teléfonos 3764694160 o 3755527638.",

    "text": "TAMPA, Fla.- March 15 is known as “National Shoe the World Day”, a day that sheds light on the importance of footwear and the need for quality footwear for millions of people worldwide who can’t afford or don’t have access to it. This year, the Tampa Police Department is proud to announce the launch of our own \"Heart and Sole\" Shoe Drive, beginning on Friday, March 15, 2024. This initiative aims to collect new or gently-used sneakers and shoes for children in need throughout our community. Having a good pair of shoes is essential for a child's well-being. It allows them to participate in activities, play safely, and feel confident. The brainchild of Sergeant Roni Hill, this project is another example of Tampa Police officers working to make a positive impact on the community they serve. \"This shoe drive is a great example of officers going above and beyond to support our community's youth,\" said Chief Lee Bercaw. \"Sergeant Hill's proactive approach will ensure that children in need have the footwear they deserve. By ensuring children have proper footwear, we're helping them stay healthy and active. It is these kinds of initiatives that strengthen our bonds with the community we protect and serve.\" Community members can also \"lace up” and help stock this shoe closet by dropping off new or gently-used sneakers and shoes at any Tampa Police District Office or Headquarters. Together, we can ensure that every child in Tampa can walk with confidence.",

    "text": "“Una gran victoria de la paz, la esperanza, la estabilidad económica, social y política de nuestro país”, manifestó el dirigente partidista durante una campaña política en el municipio Libertador, estado de Monagas (noreste), ante miles de seguidores del candidato de la Patria.\nSubrayó que tenemos números extraordinarios que nos permiten llegar a esos sufragios y “esperar una gran victoria del pueblo bolivariano”.\nEl jefe de la Comisión de Política Interior de la Asamblea Nacional (parlamento) llamó a sentirse orgullosos de “ser revolucionarios, bolivarianos y de amar esta patria».\nCabello afirmó que las fuerzas revolucionarias y chavistas «se encuentran listas para esta batalla” electoral y llamó a tener una victoria perfecta mayoritaria que garantice la paz.\nSobre los planes de la ultraderecha para desestabilizar el país, el político bolivariano indicó que no creen en elecciones y esperan la noche del 28 de julio para salir a cantar fraude, “una película que la hemos visto muchas veces cada vez que pierden”.\nEn otra masiva concentración en la ciudad de Barcelona, estado de Anzoátegui (norte), Cabello expresó que ese es un territorio chavista y allí el fascismo no pasará.\nMientras la derecha incita a la salida violenta del presidente Nicolás Maduro, “el pueblo se restea (se juega todo por el todo) y sigue luchando en contra de las sanciones”, señaló.\n«Contra quien sea nos debatimos en la calle, con argumentos y buen discurso» porque si algo sabemos nosotros es estar en la calle, enfatizó.\nLa víspera el jefe de Estado siguió de recorrido de campaña y reveló en el poblado de La Victoria, estado de Aragua (centro norte), haber visitado ya más de 100 ciudades y pueblos de todo el país, que denominó “peregrinación sagrada”.\nVoy de pueblo en pueblo a despertar a la gente, subrayó, y “no puede imponerse el odio, ni la guarimba, ni el fascismo, Venezuela va a tener paz, antes, durante y después del 28 de julio”.\nLos que vienen para Venezuela son tiempos de amor, paz y prosperidad y el 28 de julio se define “la violencia o la paz, la colonia o la patria independiente, la persecución y el fascismo o la libertad democrática”, remarcó.\nTambién ayer el candidato opositor por el Partido Soluciones por Venezuela, Claudio Fermín, declaró en el canal del Estado Venezolana de Televisión que consideraba que las elecciones “están bien organizadas y serán transparentes”, y condenó toda acción generadora de violencia y conspiración.\nMás de 21,6 millones de venezolanos están convocados a las urnas el 28 de julio para elegir el próximo presidente, entre los 10 candidatos en disputa, nueve opositores y un oficialista.\nrgh/jcd",
