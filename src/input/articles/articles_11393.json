    "title": "Sixth-grade boys born Leap Day 2012 celebrate 3rd birthday | 5newsonline.com",
    "text": "CHARLESTON, Arkansas — Carter Beason and Hemi Herrera may seem like typical sixth graders, but if you ask how old they are, there is more than one right answer. “It’s cool being a three-year-old in sixth grade,” Hemi said. “Yeah, you’re different,” Carter added. “There's something about being three and everyone else around you is 12.” Coincidentally, the two friends were both born on Leap Day in 2012, so this is only the third time they’re celebrating their true birthday. Both boys said they usually celebrate on Feb. 28 or March 1. While Leap Day is especially important for people like Carter and Hemi who only get to celebrate their actual birthday every four years, it is also important for keeping our calendar on track. While there are 365 days in a calendar year, it takes the Earth a little bit longer than that to make a full rotation around the sun. “There happens to be 365 days and almost a quarter day, a little bit less, in the solar year, so we have to adjust that if we want to keep our days lined up with our year,” astronomer and University of Arkansas physics professor Julia Kennefick said. The extra quarter-days add up over four years to make Leap Day. “It’s about keeping everything in line so that our year doesn't get out of whack, essentially, and so we're not celebrating Christmas in June,” Kennefick said. Because Feb. 29 comes around every four years, it is an unlikely birthday, and it is even more unlikely to share it with a friend. Both Carter and Hemi said they think this will be a fairly typical birthday for them: celebrating with cake and going out to eat. They are already looking ahead to their fourth birthday when they’ll be able to drive: “Going downtown in the ‘Rari, age 4,” Hemi said.

    "text": "Arsenal lose to West Ham and miss chance to return to Premier League summit By Press Association December 28 2023, 10.24pm Share Arsenal lose to West Ham and miss chance to return to Premier League summit Share via Facebook Twitter Linkedin Whatsapp Messenger Email Post link https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk-world/4852842/arsenal-denied-a-return-to-premier-league-summit-as-they-are-beaten-by-west-ham/ Copy Link West Ham United’s Angelo Ogbonna gestures to the fans after the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London. Picture date: Thursday December 28, 2023.\nArsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.\nThe Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 on a night where Hammers boss David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.\nWest Ham lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.\nA massive result for West Ham ⚒️ #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/JLAN9CInMV\n— Premier League (@premierleague) December 28, 2023\nMoyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.\nArsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.\nInstead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.\nIt was a big win for David Moyes (Adam Davy/PA) Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.\nBut at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.\nJarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.\nTomas Soucek, number 28, opened the scoring (Adam Davy/PA) Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.\nPaqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.\nThe hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.\nBukayo Saka came close to an equaliser (Adam Davy/PA) Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.\nMavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.\nJesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.\nAreola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.\nRice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",
