    "title": "Florida price gouging hotline activated as Gulf storm 97L approaches",
    "text": "Attorney General Ashley Moody on Thursday announced that Florida’s \"Price Gouging Hotline\" is live after Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 54 of 67 counties – or 80 percent of the state. The moves comes as a tropical wave , now designated as Invest 97L , could develop over the next week and head to the Sunshine State. If it develops, it could become Tropical Storm Debby , the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season . A press release from Moody's office said \"price gouging laws are now in effect for the counties covered by the state of emergency: Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Calhoun, Charlotte, Citrus, Clay, Collier, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Hernando, Hillsborough, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Manatee, Marion, Monroe, Nassau, Okaloosa, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns, Sumter, Suwannee, Taylor, Union, Volusia, Wakulla, Walton and Washington counties.\" Florida’s price gouging law applies to items and services essential to getting ready for, or recovering from, a storm within the areas of a declared state of emergency, the press release explained. That may include generators, food, gasoline, hotel rooms, ice, lumber and water. \"Violators of the price gouging statute are subject to civil penalties of $1,000 per violation and up to a total of $25,000 for multiple violations committed in a single 24-hour period,\" the release said. “Invest 97L is expected to bring heavy rain and powerful winds to much of the state,\" Moody said in a statement. \"To help Floridians prepare for this event, we are activating the price gouging hotline to accept reports of extreme price increases on essential commodities. As the system approaches, I’m urging Floridians to finalize their storm preparations, monitor weather reports and follow the guidance of local authorities.” For more information ∎ Anyone who suspects price gouging can report it to the Florida Attorney General’s Office by visiting MyFloridaLegal.com or calling 1(866) 9NO-SCAM. ∎ For more information on price gouging, read a PDF copy of \"Attorney General Moody’s Scams at a Glance: Price Gouging\" handout, online here , and in Spanish, https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/Price%2BGouging_Scams%2Bat%2Ba%2BGlance_v1a_sp%5B1%5D.pdf. ∎ Moody recently released a 2024 Hurricane Preparedness Guide . The guide contains information on tropical systems, preparedness checklists and tips for avoiding storm-related scams before, during and after a weather event.

    "text": "February 15, 2024 Contact Information Region 4 Press Office ( region4press@epa.gov ) (404) 562-8400 JACKSON, Miss. (Feb. 15, 2024) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the expansion of its successful Closing America’s Wastewater Access Gap Community Initiative to 150 additional communities as part of President Biden’s Investing America agenda. Originally launched in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the pilot initiative has been assisting 11 communities since 2022. This program, along with historic funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help thousands of Americans access the wastewater infrastructure they need to thrive to include Bolivar County, Miss.\n“Many rural and low-income communities in the U.S. lack basic running water and indoor plumbing, and our Closing America’s Wastewater Access Gap Program has been instrumental in helping communities from White Hall, Alabama to McDowell County, West Virginia to the San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona access Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to address this critical need,” said EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox. “In expanding the program to 150 additional communities, we are working to restore dignity and opportunity to underserved communities nationwide.”\nClosing America’s Wastewater Access Gap Community Initiative\nAn estimated 2 million people in the U.S. live without adequate wastewater infrastructure and safe and reliable drinking water in their homes. Many more live with wastewater infrastructure that is ineffective and puts people’s health at risk. To date, the initiative has helped provide communities with no cost technical assistance that helps identify affordable options accessing wastewater infrastructure. For example, technical assistance providers help the community conduct assessments of the community’s specific needs and submit applications for wastewater funding. So far progress for the 11 pilot communities includes seven funding awards and 10 additional funding applications submissions. All 11 communities have drafted community solution plans, which are in the process of being finalized, and will be posted to EPA’s Closing America's Wastewater Access Gap webpage in the early spring.\nBolivar County, Miss, Project\nMound Bayou’s town engineer is finalizing a facility plan for the MS CWSRF funding application by the state’s February 2024 deadline. The facility plan is the next step in the MS CWSRF process for funding a project and will include the proposed sewer extension project from Mound Bayou to the residents of Dunlap. Dunlap is a community with 34 homes in Mound Bayou, the majority of which have failed or unpermitted onsite systems. Mound Bayou currently serves water to Dunlap and has agreed to extend sewer services to this area. Extensive public outreach and meetings resulted in Mound Bayou agreeing to be the funding applicant for the sewer expansion project. The sewer project has been listed in Mississippi’s 2023 Water Pollution Control Revolving Loan Fund Program Intended Use Plan. The estimated project cost is $2 to $3 million. Interested communities can request assistance by completing the WaterTA request form .\nCommunities will be selected on a rolling basis; there is no deadline to apply. For questions, email SepticHelp@epa.gov.\nLearn more about EPA’s WaterTA services and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s historic $50 billion investment in America.",

    "text": "Democrats Want Green Party Candidate Jill Stein Removed From Wisconsin Ballot\nPlenty of leftists blamed Stein for spoiling the election for failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n12 Comments\nThe Democrats\nwant to remove Green Party candidate Jill Stein from Wisconsin’s ballot.\nDavid Strange, as an individual and deputy operations director of Wisconsin for the DNC, filed the complaint, claiming the Wisconsin Green Party (WGP) did not “comply with Wisconsin’s election statutes.”\nThe August 13, 2024 primary was the last opportunity for WGP to nominate a candidate for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly before the 2024 general election. But, WGP failed to nominate any candidates for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly, and a sufficient number of electors did not nominate a candidate by writing in any WGP candidate for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly, according to the requirements of Wisconsin Statute section 8.16(2).\nThus, WGP conclusively has no candidates for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly in the general election, nor are there currently any WGP state officeholders or holdover senators. Consequently, no individual will be authorized under Wisconsin Statute section 8.18 to nominate presidential electors to represent WGP when the nomination meeting is held on the first Tuesday of October.\nWGP’s presidential ticket is therefore ineligible and unqualified to appear on the ballot for the November 2024 general election.\nPlenty of leftists\nblamed Stein for spoiling the election for failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nStein\nreceived 31,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2016, but President Donald Trump beat Clinton in the state by only 22,000 votes.\nI know the Democrats pressured Ralph Nader not to run in 2000 and 2004.\nThe Republicans hated Ross Perot.\n“We take the nomination process for President and Vice President very seriously and believe every candidate should follow the rules,”\nsaid Adrienne Watson, a senior adviser to the DNC, according to WisPolitics.com. “Because the Wisconsin Green Party hasn’t fielded candidates for legislative or statewide office and doesn’t have any current incumbent legislative or statewide office holders, it cannot nominate candidates and should not be on the ballot in November.”\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission\napproved a spot on the ballot for the Green Party in February.\n“This is a fishing expedition conjured up by the DNC, and is in line with their statements back in March that they will hire an army of lawyers and infiltrators to find any angle of attack to prevent Green Party ballot access,”\ndeclared Jason Call, Stein’s campaign manager. “We absolutely will be hiring counsel to defend our ballot line in Wisconsin.” ",
