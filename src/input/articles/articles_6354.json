    "text": "After more wet weather on the South Coast, there has been a lot of road damage, especially in the Umdoni area.\nIn Scottburgh, particularly, due to inadequate drainage, many roads were waterlogged. As a result, roads began collapsing and cracking, making it dangerous for motorists as well as pedestrians.\nA site visit was done on Monday this week by Clr Dana Daniels at one of the most damaged roads in Scottburgh.\nAt the end of Galway Street (just before the Cordiner Street turn), a massive chunk of the road has collapsed. This section has been cordoned off with tape because of the danger.\n“It is a big concern as not many people know the extent of this damage, and it is quite risky for those driving on this road, especially at night,” said Daniels.\n“The devastating state of our roads after the storm is a direct result of the poor leadership at Umdoni by the ANC. Our service delivery and infrastructure have been neglected over the past 30 years.”\nShe also mentioned that all damaged roads have been reported, and it is just a matter of time before they are attended to.\n“DA councillors remain steadfast in their commitment to championing the community’s best interests,” she said.\nMotorists are asked to be cautious on the roads.\nHAVE YOUR SAY\nLike our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and Instagram",

    "title": "Natural treasure: Rockhounding in the Hudson Valley",
    "text": "“Not all who wander are lost. Some are just looking for cool rocks.”\n— Unknown\nRockhounding is having a moment. According to Google Trends, it is more popular now than ever before. Don’t own a pick hammer?\nThis might take some explaining.\nRockhounding is the act of finding and collecting rocks, minerals, and fossils. But why? Who are these people sifting through stones and chipping away at mountainsides? What’s the point?\nYou might be surprised.\nRockhounders are as diverse as the many specimens they collect. Some are outdoorsy types who incorporate hunting for tiny treasures into their hiking, climbing and spelunking. Others seek magic-crystal energy, drawing placebo power from gems. On the opposite end of the spectrum are amateur geologists digging into the science behind regional rock formations that date back eons. You’ll also find retailers and serious collectors seeking fortune with pickaxes and rock drills, in search of large deposits that can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars.\nGrowing up in the area, my childhood was full of finding fossils on the shores of local creeks and collecting smooth quartz and beach glass by the Ashokan Reservoir. Now that I have a nine-year-old daughter, I get to pass along these geological pastimes, rediscovering the adventure of the hunt and joy of the find. Rockhounding is one of the few hobbies that can bring young and old alike together in the glorious natural surroundings of the Hudson Valley.\nWhile New York has a fascinating geological history, it is not known as a top rockhounding state. Nonetheless, many treasures are to be found. Garnet, the official gem of our state, is found mainly in the Adirondacks but also as far south as New York City. Its hardness makes it a great industrial polishing material, while collectors prize the rare gem-quality garnet for its rich, dark, ruby-red hue.\nYou may have heard of Herkimer diamonds, which are actually super-clear quartz. A whole tourist scene has popped up around the Herkimer region, where you can pay to search through the tailings of local mines for a chance at finding some truly spectacular quartz points that are as clear as glass.\nKnowing how to look\nBut what about Ulster County? How does one go about finding anything around here?\nFirst, you don’t just have to know where to look. You have to know how to look.\nGoogle is a great place to start learning, and there are some great region-specific books like Rockhounding New York: A Guide to the State’s Best Rockhouding Sites. But you might already see the problem with hunting treasure in locations widely known as rockhounding hotspots. The secret has been out for a while, and these locations are more than likely to have been picked over.\nThis was our experience in Ellenville, where a well-known abandoned quartz and pyrite mine is hidden just a couple of minutes into the woods south of Berme Road Park. Use the parking lot closest to the woods, and you will see a path next to a small pavilion. Follow that path a short distance until it splits, and make a right. In moments you will be facing a massive sheer rock face smack in the middle of the forest.\nWe saw glittering pyrite clusters embedded in the rock, and collected small shards of milky-to-clear quartz scattered on the ground all over. A pick hammer was little match for the super-hard surfaces, but we did find some recently discovered quartz veins that looked promising for a person with more heavy-duty equipment.\nSuddenly, we were startled by a deer tumbling down the sheer rock face from some unseen origin point. It flailed as it tried to climb back up the cliff, sliding back down before hobbling off into the woods.\nYou need good gear\nOur harrowing encounter with nature was just another aspect of proof that the excitement of rockhounding is more often about the journey and experience. Sometimes you get to take home a prize. Tiny shards of quartz and broken rocks with miniscule pyrite clusters may not be noteworthy to serious rockhounders, but to the amateur they still feel like precious souvenirs of a fun adventure in nature. Whether we go home empty-handed or not, we always leave with a story to tell.\nEven casual rockhounders need some gear. A pick hammer and chisel or pry bar are necessary to get at anything embedded in rock. The area is notorious for having very hard, difficult rock to penetrate.\nIt goes without saying you need something to carry your specimens in. You’ll need to experiment to find something that isn’t too cumbersome and can be easily cleaned. You also don’t want a bunch of cool rocks and crystals banging against each other, turning into dust.\nAnd speaking of dust, get protective glasses. Seriously. You will have concrete for eyes if you don’t. A good pair of gloves is also highly recommended, as is a magnifying loupe for ogling your collected beauties.\nYou don’t have to hack away at granite to rockhound. We have found some amazing marine fossils lying along the Esopus Creek and at the Comeau property in Woodstock. Look near banks and bends in creeks long enough and you will start to see sedimentary rock featuring these prehistoric impressions.\nBe warned: If you are operating in the water in Ulster County, you’ll want a fishing permit. One day, as we returned from plucking a few rosy quartz pebbles and a handful of driftwood along the Ashokan Reservoir, we were stopped by an officer from the Department of Environmental Protection. Unaware the area had been posted as requiring a permit to enter, we were briefly detained before being told to get a fishing permit and pretend to be fishing next time. The permit is cheap, a used fishing pole costs $20, and a tackle box makes a great vessel for collecting specimens, with no one the wiser.\nWhile few would mind a person taking a pocketful of worthless quartz from a state park, it’s easy to see how this could escalate to larger-scale excavations of questionable legality. The prospector rerturning from a site with a wheelbarrow of material is likely, if caught, to be subject to returning the material at least, and criminal liability at worst.\nSecrets of respectful collecting\nStaying off private land is a must. Our state government has comparably strict laws against collecting and keeping pieces of nature, particularly if such activity disturbs or alters the landscape in any way. Tact is key.\nClearly the rockhounders who ravaged what I like to call “the secret Kingston diamond spot” didn’t get the memo on leaving nature as is.\nAbout three years ago, a friend took me to a spot in Kingston along the Hudson, directly adjacent to a city park. There, having been tipped off by another rockhounding friend. she had been prospecting for super-clear, Herkimer-like quartz. Accessible only during low tide (unless you use a rope to climb down, which we did) were small, glittering, ice-clear quartz shards everywhere. The riverbank, which climbed steeply, had a few large gouges where excavation of larger chunks of quartz was clearly taking place. Though the quartz clusters and shards were small, they were of exceptional clarity and beauty.\nHaving returned to this spot a few times this year, we found it had been picked clean. It looked as though the steep riverbank was about to cave in on itself. Someone had come through here with pickaxes and/or rock drills and taken a massive chunk out of the landscape.\nRockhounding secrets don’t stay secrets for long. Today, you’re lucky to find more than a handful of tiny quartz pieces … but I’m still not telling you where it is. Rockhounding requires a balance of insider knowledge and a good sense of judgment when it comes to respectful collecting.\nIf the prospect of prospecting in Ulster County piques your interest, the Mid-Hudson Valley Gem & Mineral Society is the hub for amateur and serious rockhounders alike. To find the best spots, you need to be networked with experts in the field. Group trips and meetings are your best bet, as you won’t get too far visiting well-known locations. Serious hobbyists and professionals often team up to share the latest and best spots to look (while keeping a few secrets to themselves).\nOur collection and our list of hunting grounds is small but growing. We’re looking forward to networking with other rock buffs and finding new spots. As fun as it is, collecting is not the most rewarding part of rockhounding. As with many things in life, the adventure is even more precious than the treasures we temporarily acquire on our passage through time. We unearth rocks to unearth ourselves.",

    "text": "Global Problem, Local Nuances Climate change knows no borders, and in South Asia, climate impacts are amplified by socio-economic issues and infrastructure that are not adapted to climate-related disasters. The burden of climate mitigation needs to be borne by all countries globally and equitably, but South Asia urgently needs to focus on adapting to the impacts of climate change the region is already seeing. In 2023, with the goal of increasing focus on adaptation, the Mittal Institute launched a new [Climate Change in South Asia Platform](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/climate/), propelled by a grant from the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard University. The Mittal Institute was one of the [Salata Institute’s five Climate Research Clusters Programs](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/02/5-salata-institute-grants-to-accelerate-climate-action/) selected across the university through a competitive process to work on [climate adaptation in South Asia](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/climate-adaptation-in-south-asia-cluster-research/), bringing together researchers from different disciplines including medicine and public health, climate science, and economics. The Salata Institute program comprises of clusters of interdisciplinary, cross-school teams of researchers working on climate change challenges. Tarun Khanna, Faculty Director of the Mittal Institute, speaks at the inaugural workshop on climate change in New Delhi, March 2023. Laying the Foundation Mittal Institute’s new Climate Change Platform kicked off with [an interdisciplinary workshop](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/delhi-workshop-on-climate-change-23/) on March 30-31, 2023 in New Delhi, bringing together a number of experts from the Centre for Policy Research, National Foundation for India, All India Disaster Management Institute, Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), the Energy and Resources Institute, BRAC and BRAC University, International Finance Corporation and other eminent organizations to discuss various crucial concerns related to climate change in the South Asian region. The extensive discussions provided key insights as the climate change platform moved forward into its inaugural year. It brought out crucial adaptation needs and the existing gaps in the region. Watch the videos from the March 2023 workshop [here](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/delhi-workshop-on-climate-change-23/). How is South Asia Adapting? In the summer of 2023, the Mittal Institute launched the project [“Mapping the Landscape of Adaptation Action in South Asia,”](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/mapping-the-landscape-of-adaptation-activity-in-south-asia/) in collaboration with partner organizations in India and Bangladesh, to examine the landscape of adaptation interventions underway in the region across sectors and actors. The team and partners – BRAC University in Bangladesh; Centre for Policy Research and All India Disaster Management Institute in India; and TrustBridge Rule of Law Foundation – began mapping the wide range of adaptation interventions underway in South Asia in response to extreme heat and other issues. The Mittal Institute supported publications by its partners examining aspects of adaptation to climate in the region. One of the gaps discovered during the March workshop discussions was the lack of climate consciousness among laypersons, including about climate impacts and possible adaptation measures. The team collaborated with the National Foundation of India and the Community Science Alliance to produce [Garmi (“Heat”)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf8hkfzl-s) an informational video on heat stroke awareness and protection, which was screened at COP28. Biraj Patnaik, Executive Director of the National Foundation for India, speaks at the workshop “Adaptation to Climate Change in South Asia and West Africa” at Harvard in November 2023. In November 2023, researchers working on adaptation analysis in South Asia and West Africa [convened in Cambridge](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/workshop-on-climate-change-in-south-asia-and-west-africa/) to discuss shared problems of climate change, communicating on South-South issues for cross-geographical learning. Ahead of COP28, the team published a policy brief, “ [Climate Change in South Asia: Requisites for a Sustainable Future](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2023/12/new-policy-brief-climate-change-in-south-asia-requisites-for-a-sustainable-future/),” summarizing the findings from the March and November workshops. Findings included the need to center at-risk communities while working to plan for various time horizons in implementation projects, and to create climate consciousness through accessible knowledge dissemination. In-region, the team is working to build a network, bringing in novel methodologies for building datasets and knowledge on climate adaptation in South Asia. The team is also engaging with Salata Cluster Research faculty working in other vulnerable regions for cross-country learning, and is collaborating with community-based organizations who have previously not been involved in adaptation conversations despite conducting relevant work. Building the Climate Platform The ‘ [Climateverse: Driving data driven responses to climate change in South Asia](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/climateverse/)’ project is building a regional data-ecosystem, working with partners in the region to assess available data, and climate-related data challenges. This key project is led by Caroline Buckee, Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; Satchit Balsari, Associate Professor in Emergency Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; and Tarun Khanna, Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor at Harvard Business School. The ongoing work is intended to support policymakers and other practitioners in the region for robust data-based decision-making. Jointly with India’s Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), as well as other Harvard faculty and post-doctoral researchers, the team has also been working on [Community HATS (Heat Adaptation and Treatment Strategies in South Asia)](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/mapping-heat/). The project looks at the impact of extreme heat on poor working women, using sensors to measure their body heat and looking at the deviations from the India Meteorological Department’s data, caused by their environment and infrastructure. Over the past year, a team of Harvard students, faculty, and researchers have conducted site visits to Ahmedabad, India, to collaborate with SEWA members and leadership on project scope and design. [Findings from this study have been made available online](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c3350b1569fe4a66b7c57841da07c535), demonstrating their experiences. The work under this project was also featured on the PBS NewsHour, looking at ‘ [How physicians are preparing for climate change and extreme heat’s impact on human health.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/research-shows-climate-change-already-putting-human-health-at-risk)’ The impacts of extreme heat and adaptation mechanisms will continue to be one of the largest focuses of the climate platform in the coming years. The Community HATS (Heat Adaptation and Treatment Strategies in South Asia) project explores heat exposure where the poor work and live. Other Projects on Climate The institute has also supported faculty working for climate change research in the region. For example, Dr. Caleb Dresser, MD, MPH, Fellow, Harvard Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment has been studying the implications of climate change for emergency care in India. Dr. Holly W. Samuelson Associate Professor of Architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, is working on a project for ‘Ultra-Low-Cost Solutions for Overheating and Sleep Disruption in Indian Homes’; Gary Adamkiewicz, Associate Professor of Environmental Health Disparities at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health is working on a project for ‘Healthy Ambient Lighting Environments for Dhaka City’; and Dr. Susan Crawford, John A. Reilly Clinical Professor of Law at the Harvard Law School [is interviewing people in Bangladesh on how they’re adapting to floods and sea level rise](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2024/04/susan-crawford/). There are also eminent fellows who have been hosted in the Cambridge office. For example, [Atul Bhalla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAN_e5kSW4c) was a Distinguished Visiting Artist with the Mittal Institute’s Climate Initiative, and [Dr. Vijay Chandru](https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2024/04/genetics-medicine/) is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow for Climate and Science. What Lies Ahead Going forward, the Mittal Institute will build on the work done over the past year and develop further, studying crucial and immediate issues in climate change throughout the region with local stakeholders. The projects are progressing in line with these ideas. The Climateverse project is looking forward to building a cohort of data entrepreneurs through training programs and informational sessions in partnership with local organizations. Community HATS is expanding beyond a pilot to an in-depth longitudinal study of individuals’ lived experiences and the physiological impact of heat on 720 women across 8 trades in Gujarat and across various age groups and housing types. With these efforts, the Mittal Institute is aiming at building a platform for researchers on climate adaptation as well as end-users of such research, bringing them together on a single platform.",

Water vapour molecules contact a sub-freezing surface and bypass the liquid stage, forming fluffy, light, solid ice crystals on the surface.”\n(Graphic displays how hoarfrost develops)\nWhile the accumulation of ice and snow can be beautiful, it can also lead to some damage as it weighs down branches and powerlines.\nMultiple days of fog and freezing fog on the central Prairies in early December 2018 resulted in more than 30,000 calls from Saskatchewan residents, reporting power outages.\nRime ice captured on Dec. 29, 2023, in Fort Frances, Ont.

    "title": "Incident Crowdstrike : Microsoft dégaine Quick Machine Recovery pour Windows 11 - Le Monde Informatique",
    "text": "Le traumatisme est encore vivace chez Microsoft après la panne généralisée de plusieurs millions de terminaux Windows le 20 juillet dernier . Une mise à jour défectueuse de Falcon Crowdstrike avait affecté des compagnies aériennes, des hôpitaux et des entreprises dans le monde entier. Les victimes ne pouvaient que constater des démarrages en boucle ou des écran bleu de la mort (BSoD). Pour ne plus revivre ce cauchemar, Microsoft a développé une fonction nommée Quick Machine Recovery ne nécessitant pas un accès direct pour résoudre les problèmes de démarrage de Windows.\n« Cette fonction proposera aux administrateurs informatiques d'exécuter des correctifs ciblés à partir de Windows Update sur les PC, même lorsque les machines ne peuvent pas démarrer, sans avoir besoin d'un accès physique au PC », a déclaré dans un blog David Weston, vice-président de l'entreprise pour la sécurité des entreprises et des systèmes d'exploitation. Il ajoute, « cette récupération à distance donnera la possibilité aux salariés de résoudre des problèmes plus rapidement que par le passé ». Le fournisseur indique qu'il déploiera la fonction Quick Machine Recovery auprès de la communauté du programme Windows 11 Insider au début de l'année 2025.\nL’accès au noyau Windows restreint La firme de Redmond travaille par ailleurs avec des éditeurs de solutions de sécurité ( avec une réunion en août dernier ) dans le cadre de l'initiative Microsoft Virus (MVI) afin d'ajouter des fonctionnalités et des outils à Windows supplémentaires. L’objectif est que les logiciels de sécurité fonctionnent en dehors du noyau Windows afin de ne pas revivre les incidents de type Crowdstrike. Habituellement, ces logiciels utilisent des pilotes du noyau pour accéder aux couches basses de l’OS afin de détecter les comportements inhabituels, de surveiller le trafic réseau et de mettre fin aux processus malveillants. Toutefois, cet accès au niveau du noyau augmente le risque qu'un pilote ou une mise à jour défectueux fasse planter un appareil qui ne démarre plus correctement.\nDavid Wetson souligne que « les produits de sécurité, comme les solutions antivirus, fonctionneront en mode utilisateur comme une simple application. Ce changement aidera les développeurs de ces produits à fournir un haut niveau de sécurité, une récupération plus facile et il y aura moins d’impact sur Windows en cas de crash ou d’une erreur ». Une beta privée sera mise à la disposition de l’écosystème en juillet 2025, assure le dirigeant.\nUne erreur dans l'article?
