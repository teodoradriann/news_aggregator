    "title": "Edo poll: PFN, CAN have learnt nothing",
    "text": "Barometer\nMay 26, 2024\nA little over one year after the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) unwisely and combatively plunged into Nigeria’s presidential election fray, and got their fingers badly burnt, the Edo State chapter of the two leading Christian bodies in the country, CAN and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), have remorselessly pledged to reenact the rashness. Responding to the campaign overtures of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the September governorship election, both the PFN and CAN have promised to vote the state’s ruling party candidate Asue Ighodalo as governor. He is an example of a good Christian, they chorused. And the other also Christian candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Benson Idahosa? Well, he is either stingy, a liar or an untrustworthy man used by the devil.\nThe Ighodalo endorsement, which took place at the PFN’s 2024 Edo State School of Ministry at the PCU-PFN administrative headquarters along Benin-Auchi Road, was hearty and total. In what seemed like an annual general meeting, the Edo State chairman of the PFN, Pastor Dr. (Mrs) M.O. Agbonifo, enthused over the candidacy of Mr Ighodalo and his running mate, and averred that the Christian body had no iota of doubt that the two gentlemen were what the state needed at the Government House. And seeming to second the motion, the State CAN Chairman, Apostle Irekpono Omoike, then formally voiced the endorsement and anchored prayers for the victory of the PDP candidates at the election. Still flush with excitement, probably at the coup they had pulled off in their one-sided endorsement, Mrs Agbonifo sarcastically dismissed the APC candidate for pledging what he could not deliver. Seizing the opportunity of that corrosive statement by the PFN leader, Governor Godwin Obaseki’s wife, Betsy, who was at the event, donated a coaster bus to the Christian body in a mockery of Mr Idahosa’s failed promise. According to her, no one should trust a man who could not redeem his pledge to God.\nThe Edo PCU-PFN programme, like many contemporary religious programmes in Nigeria, easily transformed into an auctioning event, indicating that conscience can be bought and sold unabashedly. Sensing the impact of the materialistic drift of the pastors, and caught up in the frenzy, Candidate Ighodalo himself pledged a 100KVA generator to power the administrative centre of the Christian organisation. Impressed, younger brother of the candidate, Ituah Ighodalo, pastor of the Trinity House Church, also pledged N5 million to fuel the generator when it is bought. It is striking, if not demeaning to the church, that while Candidate Ighodalo and his brother Ituah were hedging their bets, the PCU-PFN took the entire body of Christ in Edo State and pledged it to a materialist and secular cause, with the Trinity House Church pastor even likening the September governorship contest to a battle between light and darkness. Of course, the PDP candidate was the light and the APC candidate anybody’s guess.\nThe shameful politicking that unnerved the church in the 2023 presidential poll has obviously continued apace. They have learnt nothing, and forgotten nothing. In last year’s election, the church seized upon the APC’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as an alibi for their troubled conscience to throw caution to the wind and eagerly, uncharacteristically, and unwisely immersed itself in politics, sadly fighting one another. In Edo’s September governorship poll, both leading candidates, not to talk of that of the Labour Party (LP), are Christians. But having swallowed the hook, PCU-PFN sees no handicap in swallowing the line and sinker by persisting in politicking, preferring one Christian over another. Once a demon gains a foothold, it beckons on a legion. The fear of Islamisation, with which many churches spooked voters last year, turned out to be a bogeyman. But there were no apologies for desecrating the church, for cursing fellow Christians who showed a different preference, and for finally and shamefacedly realising that the APC ticket had in 2023 turned out to be more secular than the theocratic tickets of LP and the PDP.\nClearly, today, as the Edo election is finally illustrating, today’s Christian leaders are less inclined to evangelising and showing the light, and manifesting temperance and love: they are politicians who have brought the world into the church. It was remarkable at the PCU-PFN event in Edo that Mrs Obaseki even declared tongue-in-cheek that the inability of the APC candidate to redeem his pledge was a sacrilege. What is more, the PDP candidate was emphatic in declaring that should he win, he would remake the state along the vision of his Christian backers. Said he: “Permit me to express my profound gratitude to this august body of Christ. I am really humbled by the trust and confidence reposed in me. And I promise you, I won’t disappoint you or let you down. I wish to say this, too, that Edo State, like some other states, should have an Ecumenical Centre as a further step to fostering unity within the Christian faith in Edo State and we will ensure everybody has the freedom to practice and observe his faith without let or hindrance. More also, we will institute an Edo Thanksgiving Day, a day set aside in the year to thank God for everything.”\nGradually, the religious ossification many observers ascribe to the North is percolating into the South. It may be irreversible, especially in light of some of the bewildering judgements coming out of the courts from jurists tainted by religious prejudices, and the reluctance of the federal government to tackle hate crimes and religious intolerance propagated in Ilorin and other places against traditional religion worshippers. The church, it was initially believed, would help shine the light to defeat the gross darkness overtaking the country. Instead, it has capitulated; and some Edo politicians and church leaders are proud to be numbered among the ‘heathen’. Will the PCU-PFN endorsement make a difference in Edo? It is unlikely; other factors will probably determine the outcome of the vote in September. But whether the church wins or loses in Edo, few people will forget the inglorious and unscriptural agenda they are pursuing, an agenda angry Pastor Ituah himself did so much to foster in Lagos during the last poll.",

    "text": "Road 2 Recovery Foundation Opens Donation Support Page for Adler Caudle\n[Press Release](/author/press-release)\nThe following press release is from Road 2 Recovery:\nRoad 2 Recovery Foundation Opens Donation Support Page for Adler Caudle\nPOWAY, Calif. - On September 14, 2024, number 559 AMA Pro Motocross racer, 18 year old Adler Caudle was involved in a serious accident at Jeeps Motorcycle Club. During a practice session, Adler, over jumped a triple into a rhythm section causing him to not get enough lift off of the next jump. He was then sent into the face of the following jump and in an attempt to save himself, went over the next two jumps with his feet off of the pegs which sent him over the bars causing him to land on his head at the face of the last jump. As a result of his crash, Adler sustained a T-5 burst fracture with a T-5 spinal cord transection, resulting in a severe spinal cord injury.\nAdler is currently located at Saint Francis Regional Medical, in Wichita, Kansas where he has already undergone one surgery in an attempt to stabilize his spine. A spinal fusion from T-3 to T-7 with instrumentation added to the spinal column for support. Adler is currently in the surgical ICU unit being observed. Adler is now paralyzed from the waist down and it is unlikely Adler will ever be able to walk again. Despite this, he’s staying incredibly positive and hopeful, saying, “I am currently paralyzed from the belly button down and will be 'forever.' I will make a miracle happen.”\nHere are a few photos our own Mitch Kendra took of Caudle at the MX Sports Pro Racing Scouting Moto Combine events earlier this summer.\nAdler’s passion for motocross has always been inspiring, he has spent 15 years dedicated to working towards his goal of racing professional motocross and supercross. Although he won’t be racing at the national level as he’d hoped, his love for the sport remains strong. We know Adler’s positive spirit and the support from friends, family, and the rest of the motocross community will help him through this.\nFor those of you who would like to generously show your support and get updates on Adler’s recovery, please visit Adler Caudle’s Road 2 Recovery Cause Page. Additionally, we appreciate any messages and words of encouragement to lift Adler’s spirits as he and his family navigate this extremely difficult time.\nFor more information on how to support Adler Caudle, please visit his page below:",

    "title": "Arrecian las críticas a Sánchez tras su posición sobre la conexión del AVE entre Vigo y Oporto",
    "text": "El presidente de la Xunta, Alfonso Rueda, echó en cara al jefe del Ejecutivo central, Pedro Sánchez, “hablar una vez más en contra de Galicia” en la cumbre hispano-lusa de Faro, por haberse fijado como primer objetivo la conexión de AVE Madrid-Lisboa pese a que el Gobierno de Portugal apuntó como prioridad a la conexión del norte (Oporto-Vigo).\nEn declaraciones a los medios en Santiago, Rueda agradeció del compromiso ratificado por el Gobierno luso y proclamó que Portugal “ya está en fase de licitación de las obras para cumplir” el objetivo (el último horizonte que hay sobre la mesa, asumido por Portugal y por la Xunta es el del año 2032 para la conexión).\nTambién Sánchez apuntó en la pasada jornada a 2032, pero el Ejecutivo autonómico consideró que, con los pasos actuales dados por el Gobierno de España, no es un plazo “realista”.\n“Ni el anterior Gobierno portugués, ni el actual, de corte más conservador, ocultaron su intención de querer vertebrar ese país a través de la alta velocidad y hacer la conexión vía Galicia. Yo lo agradezco muchísimo porque para Galicia es algo fundamental”, reflexionó el líder gallego.\nA renglón seguido, recordó que, en su último encuentro en La Moncloa, trasladó a Sánchez que esta era una cuestión “fundamental” para Galicia. “Me escuchó y no dijo nada. Ahora por lo menos habla claro y ha manifestado sus prioridades”, recalcó, antes de incidir en que la Xunta no tiene “absolutamente nada en contra” de que se haga conexión con otras comunidades, pero no “en detrimento de Galicia”.\n“Y cuando estamos hablando de una conexión entre los países y el otro país está diciendo que prefiere la que nos favorece a nosotros, parece muy difícil de entender que el presidente de España se empeñe en otra alternativa”, lamentó, antes de añadir que Sánchez “no está contando la verdad, como en tantas cosas”.\nAsí, aludió al informe presentado por la Xunta meses atrás en los que se incidía en que España no llegaría al plazo de 2032 y la conexión con el Norte de Portugal no podría estar antes de 2034.\n“Y este miércoles Sánchez hablaba del año 2032, lo que demuestra que ni se molestó en ver los plazos realistas”, censuró Rueda y reiteró que la única partida que reflejan los Presupuestos de 2024 son 30.000 euros para la salida sur de Vigo, lo que aseguró que lamenta “muchísimo” antes de avisar: “Seguiremos haciendo toda la presión” y “toda la fuerza”.\nEl mandatario autonómico recordó que asumió recientemente la Presidencia rotatoria de la Comunidade de Traballo Galicia-Norte de Portugal y manifestó su deseo de trabajar para reforzar la alianza, y también peleará para que La Moncloa “esté a la altura de lo que Galicia está pidiendo”.\n“Es muy difícil de entender que los portugueses estén diciendo que sí y nuestro Gobierno todo lo contrario. Es muy difícil de entender y haremos lo posible por cambiarlo”, sentenció el presidente de la Xunta.\nPor su parte, el conselleiro de Presidencia, Diego Calvo, se refirió también a este tema en la misma línea –durante su intervención parlamentaria sobre presupuestos– para alertar de que “España no llega” al objetivo de que el AVE entre Galicia y Portugal esté activo en 2032.\nRecordó que la Xunta ya participó en un declaración en defensa de esta infraestructura, pero “todo parece” que será necesario “seguir haciendo mucha presión” para que se lleve cabo, aunque sea en 2033 o 2034, dijo.",

    "text": "Indaptus Therapeutics Presents Positive Mechanism of Action Data at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting NEW YORK, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Indaptus Therapeutics, Inc, (Nasdaq: INDP), a clinical stage biotechnology company dedicated to pioneering innovative cancer and viral infection treatments, was proud to unveil its poster at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in San Diego on Wednesday, April 10th. The poster details mechanism of action data that demonstrates the Company’s Decoy platform successfully induces, matures or activates multiple immune cell types involved in anti-tumor responses. The latest findings significantly enhance the Company’s understanding of its “Decoy” platform technology, which uses killed, non-pathogenic bacteria engineered to activate the immune system to attack tumors. The study highlights the platform's effectiveness in engaging key innate and adaptive immune cells, including, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, dendritic cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. In some settings, the platform also produced additive or synergistic activity in combination with IL-2, an approved cancer drug. Additionally, the data reveal that the Decoy platform may not only boost the immune system's ability to recognize and kill tumor cells, but potentially also overcome a mechanism that suppresses the immune response. The results suggest that the Company’s Decoy bacteria can both directly and indirectly prime the immune system to more effectively fight cancer. Dr. Michael Newman, Indaptus’ Founder, Chief Scientific Officer, and lead author, commented, “The new data are consistent with our preclinical animal tumor model studies and provide evidence for our hypothesis that patented Decoy bacteria can activate a wide range of innate and adaptive human immune cells involved in fighting tumors. This aligns with what we’ve observed in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of Decoy20 – broad immune activation, as evidenced by transiently increased levels of many key cytokines and chemokines following single dose administration. These findings bolster our confidence in Decoy20's potential as a multifaceted immunotherapy.” [The Company recently initiated the multi-dose cohort of its Phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumors.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=24SRXvgJ6cfty84HPEkQXHMg91wkyF9kFQxvXd3Iq6Q4jQyd9FqmlTY7NuGC-EUYDem5GN5yzz01NcNx-rCZCIot701U4C-XbhB5Ikns0qKT1Ck_Wpmbmi2zoHmc5q2sRzjstBcXp7Jh8GmEZTN90PEcLXZdew_6UXJ3H71_MnJpXAhUj2uOHGFX6ZeEg93ymuo0cCRqIR45J_X6k20L_3JBieliyPA-G5rlUoFzjWHrG9KE6Z6iUb3VdIelzmre2f98lL_mmeAWcxd8sDzKhg==) Jeffrey Meckler, Indaptus’ Chief Executive Officer, added, “We are encouraged by the promising results observed in our preclinical studies and our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. The recognition and validation from prestigious organizations such as the AACR, coupled with the support and insights we are receiving from medical experts, partners and investors at the conference, inspire us to continue advancing our technology and demonstrating its significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of solid tumors.” The full poster can be accessed on the Indaptus Therapeutics website by clicking [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EgM8F6sfiAXPqIgAWIp_h_du6JKOKWmHwfvErlu3fuLC2gfROZgg0pMH9IdKPkQeGQEHMWF-FIT0_lJkeUtv9aSLLOoRTdZeAY0OVYXXXjLLxuRsyzrUdPKZLIBsLzVChR2j8X6GACZFgeg0WddAmAgNfgko3Sh3Q30__DztL7I=). About Indaptus Therapeutics Indaptus Therapeutics has evolved from more than a century of immunotherapy advances. The Company’s novel approach is based on the hypothesis that efficient activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells and pathways and associated anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses will require a multi-targeted package of immune system-activating signals that can be administered safely intravenously (i.v.). Indaptus’ patented technology is composed of single strains of attenuated and killed, non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria producing a multiple Toll-like receptor (TLR), Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) and Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist Decoy platform. The product candidates are designed to have reduced i.v. toxicity, but largely uncompromised ability to prime or activate many of the cells and pathways of innate and adaptive immunity. Decoy product candidates represent an antigen-agnostic technology that have produced single-agent activity against metastatic pancreatic and orthotopic colorectal carcinomas, single agent eradication of established antigen-expressing breast carcinoma, as well as combination-mediated eradication of established hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas in standard pre-clinical models, including syngeneic mouse tumors and human tumor xenografts. In pre-clinical studies tumor eradication was observed with Decoy product candidates in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy, low-dose chemotherapy, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or an approved, targeted antibody. Combination-based tumor eradication in pre-clinical models produced innate and adaptive immunological memory, involved activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells, and was associated with induction of innate and adaptive immune pathways in tumors after only one i.v. dose of Decoy product, with associated “cold” to “hot” tumor inflammation signature transition. IND-enabling, nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrated i.v. administration without sustained induction of hallmark biomarkers of cytokine release syndromes, possibly due to passive targeting to liver, spleen, and tumor, followed by rapid elimination of the product. Indaptus’ Decoy product candidates have also produced significant single agent activity against chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in pre-clinical models.

    "text": "By Dan Williams and Nidal al-Mughrabi\nJERUSALEM/DOHA (Reuters) - Israel prepared to advance its war on Gaza farther south, close to the Egyptian border, after claiming to have dismantled Hamas in Khan Younis, as diplomatic efforts in pursuit of a ceasefire accelerated.\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Thursday that success in the fight against the Palestinian militants in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a major ground attack last week, meant its forces could advance to Rafah on the enclave's southern border.\nMore than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people are sheltering in this area, mainly cold and hungry in makeshift tents and public buildings.\n\"We are achieving our missions in Khan Younis, and we will also reach Rafah and eliminate terror elements that threaten us,\" Gallant said in a statement.\nAt the same time, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoped for a positive response from Hamas, which runs Gaza, to the first concrete proposal for an extended halt to fighting, agreed with Israel and the U.S. at talks in Paris last week.\nA Palestinian official close to the negotiations told Reuters the text envisages a first phase of 40 days, during which fighting would cease while Hamas freed remaining civilians among the more than 100 hostages it still holds. Further phases would see the handover of Israeli soldiers and bodies of dead hostages.\nSuch a long pause would be a first since Oct. 7, when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, precipitating an Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of Gaza.\nHealth officials in the enclave said on Thursday the confirmed Palestinian death toll had risen above 27,000, with thousands more dead still lying under the rubble.\nNO RESPONSE FROM HAMAS YET TO PROPOSAL\nA Palestinian official said Hamas was unlikely to reject the proposal outright, but would demand guarantees that fighting would not resume, something Israel has not agreed to.\nThere was brief elation in Gaza on Thursday after remarks by a Qatari spokesman at Johns Hopkins University in Washington sparked ceasefire hopes - and a drop in the price of crude oil.\nBut Qatari officials in the capital Doha and Taher Al-Nono, media adviser to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, said the group had not responded yet.\nGaza residents said Israeli forces pounded areas around hospitals in Khan Younis, and stepped up attacks close to Rafah. Combat has also surged in recent days in northern areas around Gaza City that Israel claimed to have subdued weeks ago.\nOsama Ahmed, 49, a father of five from Gaza City now sheltering in western Khan Younis, said there had been fierce resistance in the city, and relentless bombardment from air, ground and sea as Israeli tanks advanced.\n\"All we want is a ceasefire now,\" he told Reuters by phone.\nAn air strike on a house in Khan Younis wounded 13 people on Thursday, according to hospital officials.\nAppeals to Israel from its main ally, the United States, show little sign of having succeeded in easing the plight of Gaza's civilians.\nWashington is stepping up indirect pressure, however.\nU.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order that aims to punish Jewish settlers who attack Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in an surge of violence triggered by the war in Gaza.\nBiden is also under pressure to respond to the killing of three U.S. soldiers by a drone in Jordan last week, the first U.S. deaths in an escalation of violence across the Middle East since Israel's war in Gaza began in October.\nThe United States, which has said it does not want to ignite a wider war, believes the drone, which also wounded more than 40 people, was made by Iran, four U.S. officials told Reuters.\nCBS News reported on Thursday that targets for U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the killings include \"Iranian personnel and facilities\", citing American officials.\nThe U.S. is continuing its strikes with allies against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen, which has attacked shipping in the Red Sea in what it says is solidarity with Gaza.\nThe U.S. military said it had hit up to 10 drones in Yemen being prepared for launch, while a U.S. Navy ship downed three Iranian-made drones and a Houthi anti-ship missile\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Doha, Paul Grant in Washington, Tala Ramadan and Jana Choukeir in Dubai, Dan Williams and Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem; Writing by Cynthia Osterman; Editing by Diane Craft)",
