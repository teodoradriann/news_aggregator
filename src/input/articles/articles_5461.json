    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nLil Baby brought a group of his famous friends out to perform with him in honor of his birthday.\nOn Wednesday night, December 27, the Georgia native hosted his sold-out \"Lil Baby & Friends\" concert at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta. During the show, fans saw Baby reunite with Quavo and pay homage to the late TakeOff . Quavo performed their Only Built For Infinity Links hit \"Hotel Lobby\" as well as his stand-out collaboration with Future \"Turn Yo Clic Up.\" J. Cole also pulled up to the show and performed his hits \"Middle Child\" and \"No Role Modelz.\"\nThose weren't the only guests who made headlines for their surprise sets. Yung Miami also popped up at the concert to perform her verse off Lola Brooke's \"Don't Play With It\" (Remix). She had everyone going crazy after fans thought she tried to shoot her shot at Baby while on stage.\n“If I throw it back can you catch it?” Caresha asked Baby.\nBaby also invited other major acts like 2 Chainz , Lil Durk , Gloss Up , 21 Savage , Veeze , Saucy Santana , Hunxho , Fridayy , YTB Fatt , Rob49 , 42 Dugg , Jacquees and more to join him during the concert. His all-star show went down just months after Baby wrapped up his \"It's Only Us Tour\" following the release of his previous LP It's Only Me .\nCheck out more moments from Lil Baby's birthday concert below.",

    "text": "MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Ohio (WKEF) – Law enforcement agencies all over Montgomery County are promoting traffic safety. They are primarily cracking down on those who drive under the influence. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office is working with Ohio State Patrol and police departments from several cities to reduce traffic-related crimes. They are doing this by implementing sobriety checkpoints, establishing a joint traffic enforcement detail, and displaying how they are taking part in “The National Drive Sober Or Get Pulled Over Campaign.” “We don’t want to have to go knock on that door and tell somebody that their family member is not coming home because of an impaired driver,” said Captain Andy Flagg of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office. “You know, it happens quite often, more often than any of us would like, in Montgomery County, in the state of Ohio, and across the nation.” On August 16th, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, as well as many other agencies, will begin taking part in “The National Drive Sober Or Get Pulled Over Campaign.” In 2023, there were 512 OVI related crashes in Montgomery County with 43 of them resulting in death. Law enforcement is aiming to reduce these numbers for 2024 by raising awareness, educating the public, and setting up sobriety checkpoints at several places throughout the county. Flagg continued, “When you take somebody that likes to drive fast, or without turn signals, or other little things, and you add impairment into that, it kind of emphasizes those problems. You come out with far more severe results.” As well as reinforcing sober driving, the agencies in Montgomery County formed a joint traffic enforcement detail along Interstate 75 and State Route 48. This detail will involve the County Sheriff’s Office, Ohio State Patrol, and police departments from Dayton, Vandalia, Moraine, and many other cities. With this detail, their goal is to reduce traffic related crimes in these areas and promote collaboration between departments to ensure that all county roads are safer. “For the purpose of collaborating and filling the roles that need to be filled in these particular campaigns, we’re trying to make sure that we are making a safe county,” Flagg added. The National Drive Sober Or Get Pulled Over Campaign” begins on August 16th, and will run all the way through September 2nd.",

    "text": "Robert Redfield, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control, has revealed that US government agencies funded the creation of the Coronavirus. “They funded the research, both from NIH [National Institutes of Health], the State Department’s USAID and the Defense Department.”\nAccording to the former CDC chief, the “scientific mastermind behind the research” was Dr. Ralph Baric, widely regarded as one of the world’s leading experts on coronaviruses. Redfield said that the virus was “intentionally engineered as a part of a biodefense program.” I am convinced that the “vaccine” was intentionally designed to reduce the world’s population via early death and infertility. This was the agenda behind the pressure to vaccinate the Earth’s entire population. https://www.rt.com/news/607966-us-covid-origin-claim/\nThe vile despicable American media and the corrupt Big Pharma-dominated US medical system continue to deceive Americans with their lies that Covid came from bats and the Covid “vaccine,” which is not a vaccine, is safe and effective. Big Pharma uses campaign contributions to keep the US Congress silent. Murder and injury larger in scale that Israel’s genocide of Palestine has been covered up by the whore American media and cowardly US Congress.",

    "text": "Al cierre de esta edición, Armando Leyva Sosa, piloto de la avioneta modelo M-18 accidentada este jueves 20 de junio, mientras realizaba labores de fumigación en áreas arroceras de La Sierpe, provincia de Sancti Spiritus, continúa cumpliendo normalmente el protocolo de seguimiento y vigilancia establecido, en la sala de observaciones del Hospital Camilo Cienfuegos, de la cabecera provincial, sin que hasta ese momento se reportaran resultados o síntomas de alteración en los exámenes realizados. De acuerdo con la valoración del doctor Alexánder Concepción, jefe de la guardia de cirugía, “el paciente se encuentra estable, bien, sin cambios en la tensión arterial, frecuencia cardíaca, respiración o temperatura…” Radiografías de tórax, ultrasonidos abdominales y otros exámenes de rutina han confirmado la no existencia de lesiones pluripulmonares, en órganos internos o de otra índole, como consecuencia del accidente que precipitó el aparato a tierra, según explica la joven Marian Laura Díaz, enfermera de la sala. En muy breve conversación con Granma, Leyva Sosa agradeció la sensible atención recibida, primero por especialistas del policlínico ubicado en La Sierpe y luego de su traslado hacia el hospital provincial, así como las numerosas llamadas que ha recibido por parte de familiares, amigos y compañeros de trabajo, interesados en conocer acerca de la evolución y estado de salud. Como expresó en su perfil de Facebook Eduardo Rodríguez Dávila, ministro cubano de Transporte, la avioneta pertenece a la Empresa Nacional de Servicios Aéreos (ENSA) y una comisión del Instituto de Aeronáutica Civil de Cuba investiga las causas del suceso.",

    "text": "In 1999, Benchmade shook up the pocket knife space with the debut of its first-ever AXIS lock-equipped model with the 710. And with 25 years having passed since the 710’s debut, the\nOregon City outfit has opted to mark the occasion via a special run of modernized, re-mastered 710 knives crafted from a super premium material selection.\nThough it largely stays true to the original 710 design from two-and-a-half-decades-ago, the new Seven | Ten lineup jettisons the original knife’s D2 and G10 constructions in favor of more contemporary — and markedly more top-shelf — machined aerospace-grade anodized 6061-T6 aluminum scales and a 4-inch recurve drop point blade offered in CPM MagnaCut or CPM S90V. Spanning 8.95” overall, both the MagnaCut and S90V versions also see the original 710’s FRN backspace replaced with a knurled aluminum item. Made in America and backed by a lifetime warranty, both aluminum handle Seven | Ten models also benefit from a redesigned take on\nBenchmade’s signature AXIS lock.\nWhile there’s no denying how special these two aforementioned Seven | Ten releases are, Benchmade has nonetheless opted to give its most discerning customers the option to acquire an even rarer, and more elite 710 tribute. This ultra-top-shelf version is legitimately made from some of the finest materials currently available to the knife making world. For starters, its handle is crafted from 6AL-4V titanium and features a black DLC-coating and a super ornate backspacer design — along with the same redesigned AXIS lock present on the MagnaCut and S90V versions. Rather than using a CPM metal, the titanium-scaled Seven | Ten gets a super-premium Fafnir-pattern Damascus steel blade courtesy of Sweden’s Damasteel. This beautiful layered blade is also deployed via a specially-machined set of thumb-studs that, like the backspacer, sport a unique and ornate design.\nThe Benchmade Seven | Ten knife lineup is available for order now, with pricing starting at $600 for the aluminum and MagnaCut version, and going up to $1,500 for the titanium and Damascus variant.",

    "text": "image copyrightReuters\nPhoto caption, Russian President Vladimir Putin has already threatened the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the past, but this scenario is expected to become more concrete with the proposal to revise the nuclear doctrine document. Article related information\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced on the 25th (local time) that he is considering revising the nuclear doctrine document, which contains the principles of nuclear use.\nIt included the content that if a non-nuclear-weapon state carries out a “joint attack” on Russia with the support of a nuclear-weapon state, the supporting state will also be considered an aggressor. This part is interpreted as a threat that nuclear weapons may be used in the war in Ukraine.\nPresident Putin announced on the night of the 25th after the National Security Council that the Russian government is considering revising the rules and preconditions for using nuclear weapons.\nUkraine is a non-nuclear state that receives military support from other nuclear weapons states, including the United States.\nPresident Putin’s remarks came as Ukraine asked the West for permission to use long-range missiles it supported to target Russian military facilities.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy headed to the United States this week and is scheduled to meet President Joe Biden in Washington on the 26th (local time), so this request is expected to be top of the agenda.\nUkraine has pushed into mainland Russia this year and wants to fire missiles at military bases in Russia that it claims are where the missiles are launched.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak responded to President Putin’s remarks by saying, “There is nothing in Russia that can threaten the world other than the nuclear threat.”\nIn fact, President Putin has previously threatened to use nuclear weapons. At the time, Ukraine criticized it as a “nuclear blackmail” aimed at preventing further support from Western allies.\nChina, Russia’s ally, also urged restraint, with reports that President Xi Jinping warned President Putin against using nuclear weapons.\nHowever, after the National Security Council meeting on the 25th, President Putin announced a radical revision plan.\nThe revised nuclear doctrine “clearly contains the conditions under which Russia could transition to the use of nuclear weapons,” and was followed by a warning that a conventional missile attack against Russia would also be included as a condition for the use of nuclear weapons.\nPutin said Russia would consider the “possibility” of using nuclear weapons if it senses a “grave threat” to national sovereignty due to large-scale launches of missiles, aircraft and drones into its territory.\nHe added, “Even if the subject of the attack on Russia was a non-nuclear state, any country participating or receiving support from a nuclear state would regard it as a joint attack by them.”\nPresident Putin claims that nuclear weapons are “the most important and certain promise that guarantees the safety of the Russian state and people.”\nAfter the end of World War II, nuclear-armed states engaged in a policy of nuclear deterrence, believing that a preemptive large-scale nuclear attack by a warring state could lead to mutually assured destruction.\nHowever, there are also tactical nuclear weapons, which are small warheads designed to destroy limited targets without extensive radioactive fallout (radioactive material that spreads and remains in the surrounding area during a nuclear explosion).\nLast June, President Putin told European countries supporting Ukraine, “Even if the United States brings its own tactical nuclear weapons, Russia has far more (tactical nuclear weapons) than the entire European continent has.” sent a warning to\nAt the time, President Putin said, “Europe does not have an up-to-date (early warning system),” and criticized, “In this sense, they are almost defenseless.”\nAt that time, President Putin already hinted that he might revise the nuclear doctrine document, which contains the conditions under which Russia can use nuclear weapons.",

El motivo es, entre otros, la falta de acuerdo con el equipo de Gobierno municipal para recuperar el poder adquisitivo en 2024.\nAsí lo informan a través de una nota de prensa. En ella, explican que desde 2010 el poder adquisitivo de los trabajadores ha disminuido en un 16%, y en el caso de los trabajadores del Ayuntamiento de Pasaia, esta pérdida de poder adquisitivo es más acusada debido a que los salarios de esta localidad son actualmente inferiores a los salarios de los trabajadores de otros ayuntamientos de la comarca de Oarsoaldea. Por ello, la primera concentración ha tenido lugar este viernes, a las 12.00 horas, frente al Palacio Arizabalo. Se han agrupado 50 trabajadores.\nLa Junta de Personal ha anunciado su intención de continuar con las movilizaciones en las próximas semanas y ya ha realizado un llamamiento para la próxima, que tendrá lugar el 5 de diciembre, a las 10.00 horas, a las puertas del consistorio de Pasaia.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\n[\nUn apartamento repleto de detalles que sorprende por su funcionalidad\n](https://www.elnortedecastilla.es/valladolid/apartamento-repleto-detalles-sorprende-funcionalidad-20241125064242-nt.html#vca=voc-recirc&vso=diariovasco)\nEl Norte de Castilla\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "text": "Hay dos personas detenidas por los hechos25 mayo, 2024 11:25 La Guardia Civil ha detenido a dos personas dentro de la Operación Sayos. Se trata de una mujer y un hombre, supuestos autores de los delitos de robo con fuerza que se han producido desde el pasado mes de mayo de 2023 en un total de 28 iglesias y ermitas ubicadas en la provincia de León. La operación comenzó a finales del 2023, tras detectar los investigadores la comisión de varios delitos de idéntica naturaleza. Robos con fuerza en el interior de los templos religiosos con el mismo modus operandi. En todos los casos sustraían el dinero de cepillos y lampadarios, los cuales previamente habían forzado, sin llevarse otros objetos de valor que se encontraban dentro de los templos. A la vista de los hechos, los cuales habían generado gran alarma social entre los vecinos de las localidades afectadas y, tras la práctica de numerosas diligencias de investigación y otras pesquisas, por los agentes encargados de la investigación pudo determinarse que los detenidos se valían del empleo de la fuerza para violentar, tanto las puertas de acceso a los templos, como los cepillos y/o lampadarios que se encontraban en los mismos para, posteriormente sustraer el dinero en efectivo que hallaban en su interior. Además, todos los hechos fueron cometidos en el interior de iglesias ubicadas en pequeñas localidades y en horas –generalmente por las noches– en las que los supuestos autores se aseguraban una baja afluencia de personas para así evitar ser descubiertos. Alta movilidad geográfica Si bien todos los robos se circunscriben al ámbito geográfico de la provincia de León, los detenidos llegaron a recorrer cientos de kilómetros en una sola noche para cometer los robos en distintas localidades, no descartándose su participación en hechos de similar naturaleza en iglesias ubicadas en otras provincias limítrofes. Los detenidos se habían especializado en la comisión de este tipo de robos, a los cuales les figura un amplio historial delictivo en los registros policiales. Con las detenciones practicadas se dan por esclarecidos los robos en 28 templos religiosos acontecidos durante los últimos años en la provincia de León, concretamente en las localidades de Castrotierra de la Valduerna, Brimeda, Destriana, Pobladura de Yuso, Ransinde, Villibañe, Mozóndiga (2), Chozas de Arriba (2), Pozuelo del Páramo, Moral de Orbigo, Villarín del Páramo, Cazanuecos (2), La Antigua, Torneros del Bernesga, Val de San Román, Altobar de la Encomienda (2), Navianos de la Vega, La Nora del Río, Quintana del Marco, Genestacio de la Vega (2), Moscas del Páramo (3). Las actuaciones han sido llevadas a cabo por componentes del Área de Delincuencia Patrimonial-Económica de la Unidad Orgánica de Policía Judicial de León. Los detenidos fueron puestos a disposición de los Juzgados de Instrucción de La Bañeza (León).",
