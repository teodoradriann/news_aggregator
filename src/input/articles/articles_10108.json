    "text": "We hope that Carl Erskine, unlike George Bailey in “It’s a Wonderful Life,” never had cause to doubt the positive impact of his life on his hometown. Without Carl Erskine, the people of Anderson wouldn’t have had one of their own to root for playing Major League Baseball in the 1940s and ‘50s. The baseball program at Anderson College (now university) likely never would have developed into a source of community pride. The local insurance and banking industries would have suffered from the absence of his leadership and business acumen. The Special Olympics movement would not have become so strong and vital nationally, and might not have even existed locally. The Hopewell Center in Anderson for people with disabilities might never have been founded. Erskine Elementary School would never have been built. And the Erskine Green Training Center in Muncie, the first-of-its-kind postsecondary vocational training program, might never have been established. Without Carl, the world would never have known his children, including son Jimmy, who lived to be 63 despite having Down syndrome. And the world would have known little about his wonderful wife, Betty. The people of Anderson would never have heard his humorous and poignant stories about his baseball career. The world would never have seen the love and respect he showed for his Dodgers teammate when Jackie Robinson faced intense racial prejudice while breaking Major League Baseball’s color barrier. Likewise, the people of Anderson wouldn’t have learned the lessons of love and tolerance from Carl’s childhood friendship with Johnny Wilson, another local legend. Carl would never have been around to author books about his relationships with Jackie and Johnny and the parallels he saw between racial injustice and injustice against people with disabilities. We would never have gotten to enjoy the annual “Little Bit Country” concert performances, with Carl on the harmonica, to benefit local Special Olympics. Our hearts would never have swelled with pride when he returned to the Dodgers many years after his baseball career to play the Star-Spangled Banner on the harmonica. And the people of Anderson never would have felt an intense vicarious pride whenever Carl received a lifetime achievement award or other major honor. Yes, if Carl Erskine had asked on his death bed Monday to see what the world would be like if he had never existed, a vision of a much different Anderson, a much different Indiana and a much different America would have appeared. And that would have been cause for tears and great mourning for a life unfulfilled and a community and country greatly diminished. Instead, we can stand together today in gratitude to Carl Erskine for everything that he did. He loved Anderson and never wanted to live anywhere else. And we loved him back. In the aftermath of Carl’s death, our hearts are aching, but they’re filled with gratitude. Carl Erskine’s life is testament to the power of good in a world that sorely needs it. — The Herald Bulletin, Anderson",

    "title": "Bridgerton season 3 part 2 plot twist: Who is Michaela Stirling?",
    "text": "Dear reader, the introduction of Michaela Stirling is the plot twist no one expected on Netflix’ Bridgerton season 3 part 2.\nThe reveal marks a significant turn of events as the new character enters the Bridgertonverse in the final moments of the finale.\nMichaela Stirling, played by Masali Baduza , was introduced to Francesca ( Hannah Dodd ) by John Stirling (Victor Alli) at the Featherington sisters’ ball.\nWho is Michaela Stirling, you ask? Well, the new character has entered the fray as John Stirling’s cousin and already has fans speculating about what’s to come in season 4.\nVisibly in a daze, the look on Francesca’s face when introduced to Michaela leaves viewers wondering if there will be romance between the women next season. Could there be something more to Francesca’s reaction to her new in-law?\nThis is likely, considering series showrunner Jess Browning says she has “been pitching the Francesca queer story from the beginning.”\n“When I read her book, I, as a queer woman, really related to her book. Maybe in a way Julia Quinn didn’t intend, but a lot of Francesca’s book is about feeling different from her family and from the world around her and not really knowing why,” Browning told Deadline .\n“In the book, I think it’s mostly just about being introverted. But I think for a lot of queer people, not every queer person, but a lot of queer people, that sense of feeling different from the time you’re young, is part of our stories. So it felt like a natural one to gender bend.”\n(L to R) Hannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton and Victor Alli as John Stirling in “Bridgerton.” (LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX) In an interview with Glamour , Brownell also explains the need for queer representation on the series. “Queer audiences haven’t gotten the chance to see themselves represented in a major way on the show, which is a show that is in so many other ways so inclusive,” Browning told the publication. “I felt like there was fertile ground thematically in (Francesca’s) book to nod toward telling a queer story.“\nHowever, Browning hasn’t revealed if this storyline is coming in season 4, or if fans will have to wait for another season to see how Francesca’s love story unfolds.\nSubsequently, Netflix hasn’t revealed who the lead will be in the forthcoming season.\nIn the meantime, Bridgerton season 3 parts 1 and 2 are streaming now on Netflix.",

    "text": "Manuel José Merizalde, con gran inicio en el Latin America Amateur Championship 2025\nLas temperaturas altas no fueron impedimento para Manuel José Merizalde. El golfista cafetero firmó la mejor tarjeta de su país en la ronda inicial del Latin America Amateur Championship (LAAC) 2025 y, como si fuera poco, se instaló en el primer lugar del certamen. Por ahora, comparte la punta con Patrick Sparks (Perú) y Gabriel Palacios (Guatemala).\nSu registro fue impecable. Registró una tarjeta de 66 impactos y logró deslumbrar en el Pilar Golf Club, que alberga la prestigiosa competición aficionada. Los 32 grados de temperatura sofocaron a los participantes, pero Merizalde pudo reponerse y sacó fuerzas para un gran inicio, con broche de oro.\n“Estoy muy contento con la ronda de hoy. Uno en el golf nunca sabe cuánto va a hacer. La clave estuvo en que estuve muy bien en el putt, en estos torneos hay que saber por qué estamos aquí y, para mí, hay que saber que uno se vino a divertir, así como lo hice”, fueron las palabras del golfista, quien representa al Club Campestre de Cali.\nMerizalde inició el 2025 tras poca actividad, más allá de la rutina de cada semana. A pesar de que no esperaba una ronda tan favorable, tampoco tuvo presiones. Lo segundos golpes le dieron una importante ventaja.\n“No me imaginaba terminar como terminé hoy. Mi expectativa estaba en lograr estar cerca del par, pero las cosas se dieron para mi favor. Este es un campo abierto y hace viento, algo que se acomoda bastante a mi juego y que me hace sentir cómodo en la cancha”, complementó.\nEn el top 10 del tablero está Jorge Corchuelo, el segundo mejor colombiano. Cerró con un total de 68 golpes, que lo adjudican en el sexto lugar. En el puesto 34 hay un triple empate entre Mateo Fuenmayor, Carlos Ardila y Santiago Rivas.",

    "title": "5 Q's with Riccardo Vittoria, Cofounder of Acai Travel",
    "text": "The Center for Data Innovation recently spoke with Riccardo Vittoria, co-founder of Acai Travel , a New York-based company using AI to modernize and streamline travel operations. Vittoria discussed how Acai’s platform helps agencies respond more quickly to airline policy changes and support requests by integrating directly with real-time airline data sources.\nDavid Kertai: What inspired the start of Acai Travel?\nRiccardo Vittoria: Acai Travel was founded to fix long-standing inefficiencies in the travel industry. Travel agencies struggle with constant fare changes, complex refund rules, and customer support demands, made worse by staffing shortages and outdated systems. Travelers, in turn, face fragmented, frustrating experiences, especially when changing plans or trying to get help.\nOur platform tackles this by using AI to interpret live travel data like fare rules, schedule changes, and refund policies, and automatically take action. That might mean updating a booking, applying a new policy, or notifying agents of a change, all without manual input. This keeps systems current and frees up human agents to focus on higher-value work, helping agencies stay responsive even under pressure. Acai powers the back-end systems that agencies and corporate booking tools rely on, doing the behind-the-scenes work that makes travel smoother and more scalable.\nKertai: Where does your platform get its data, and how does it adapt to changes?\nVittoria: Acai pulls live data from global distribution systems, airline websites, and newer airline feeds built to support more personalized bookings, known as New Distribution Capability, or NDC. These sources provide the latest fare rules, schedules, refund policies, and other key details. Acai verifies and applies this data automatically, so agents and systems always stay up to date without needing manual fixes.\nWhat makes Acai different is how it handles change. Instead of relying on hard-coded rules or delayed system updates, Acai connects directly to tools like booking platforms, traveler profiles, and revenue management systems, allowing them to communicate through AI. When something shifts—like a new fare rule or pricing logic—the platform adapts instantly, updating every system it touches. It’s a flexible, real-time layer that keeps the entire travel workflow aligned, much like a human agent would, but faster and more reliably.\nKertia: Do your solutions include any front-facing tools that directly interact with travelers, and if so, how is the AI’s role communicated?\nVittoria: Yes, Acai Travel does offer solutions that enable direct, front-facing interactions with travelers, such as intelligent chat interfaces, self-service portals, and post-booking support tools. These allow travel agencies and corporate users to make changes, request refunds, or get real-time updates by interacting directly with the system, without needing to go through a live agent.\nTransparency is essential. We always let users know when they’re interacting with our platform’s AI systems. Interestingly, many prefer using the tools than being directed to human agents. Travelers are looking for fast, accurate solutions, and when the system delivers, most are happy to skip the wait and resolve their issue on the spot. After more than a decade building AI systems for travel, we’ve learned that success isn’t about imitating a person, it’s about solving real problems, quickly and reliably.\nKertai: How does your AI system decide when to send a case to a human agent?\nVittoria: Acai uses a dual-agent system designed to manage customer interactions more intelligently. One AI agent handles the task at hand, whether it’s processing a change, resolving a booking issue, or answering a support request, while a second, supervisory AI oversees the entire interaction in real-time. This supervisor monitors customer sentiment, detects urgency, and watches for potential service-level risks.\nIf it senses frustration or a request to speak with a human, it immediately escalates the issue to the appropriate person, whether a support rep, team lead, or manager. It integrates directly with tools like Salesforce, Zendesk, Genesys, and Microsoft Outlook to ensure handoffs are seamless. By coordinating these actions, the system operates autonomously when possible, but knows exactly when to bring in a human, delivering both speed and a personalized touch.\nKertai: Where do you see Acai Travel in the future of the travel industry?\nVittoria: We envision Acai at the center of a more coordinated, responsive travel ecosystem. With Acai, we aim to connect these systems through real-time, AI-powered coordination, allowing tools to “listen” to each other and adapt dynamically. Instead of relying on rigid, pre-defined logic, our agentic AI helps systems communicate and collaborate, much like a conductor guiding musicians into harmony. That’s the future we’re building: smart platforms working together to create smooth, intuitive experiences across the entire travel journey.",

    "title": "Врач Аверьянова: долгий перелет опасен для беременных рисками тромбозов",
    "text": "Врач рассказала, в каких случаях беременным нельзя летать самолетом\nВо время полета в самолете организм подвергается воздействию пониженного давления и кислородного дефицита, что может негативно сказаться на состоянии будущей мамы и ребенка. Кроме того, длительное сидение ограничивает кровообращение в ногах, повышая риск тромбозов. Об этом РИАМО сообщила акушер-гинеколог центра репродуктивного здоровья «СМ-Клиника» Ирина Аверьянова.\n«В связи с этим беременным женщинам рекомендуется консультироваться с врачом перед планированием авиапутешествий», — объяснила Аверьянова.\nОна перечислила возможные риски, которые противопоказаны беременным при перелетах:\n- Угроза прерывания беременности или преждевременных родов. Если у женщины наблюдаются кровянистые выделения, боли внизу живота или другие признаки угрозы выкидыша, перелет может усугубить ситуацию.\n- Плацентарная недостаточность и предлежание плаценты. Эти состояния повышают риск кровотечений и ухудшают снабжение плода кислородом.\n- Неконтролируемая артериальная гипертензия и преэклампсия. Высокое артериальное давление и отеки могут усугубиться из-за изменения давления в самолете.\n- Многоплодная беременность с осложнениями. При риске преждевременных родов или других осложнениях перелет нежелателен.\n- Инфекционные заболевания в острой стадии. Любые острые инфекции могут негативно повлиять на здоровье матери и ребенка.\n- Серьезные хронические заболевания матери. Например, сердечно-сосудистые патологии, диабет с нестабильным течением и другие состояния, требующие постоянного контроля.\nСпециалист напоминает, что перед перелетом стоит проконсультироваться с врачом-гинекологом. Его рекомендации помогут сохранить здоровье женщины и малыша. Путешествовать лучше во втором триместре, с 14 до 28 недель, когда риск осложнений минимален.",

    "text": "Depois de conseguir eliminar o Arsenal na Taça de Inglaterra, jogando mais de uma hora com um jogador a menos, o Manchester United voltou ao 'Teatro dos Sonhos' para viver nova exibição sofrível em campo e a aproveitar o génio de Diallo.\nA jogar contra o último classificado, o Southtampton, a equipa de Ruben Amorim sofreu para chegar à vitória. Apesar de alguns rasgos no início da partida, a equipa do sul de Inglaterra mostrou mais argumentos, liderada pelo português Mateus Fernandes. Depois muito assustar Onana, perto do intervalo, o Southampton chegou ao golo através de um pontapé de canto, com Ugarte a desviar de forma infeliz a bola para a própria baliza.\nQuando se esperava uma reação do Manchester United na segunda parte, Antony ameaçou o empate com duas ocasiões claras mas o Southampton voltou a pegar no comando do jogo perante a apatia da equipa da casa que, apesar das substituições, não foi capaz de criar verdadeiras ocasiões de perigo.\nNo entanto, os últimos dez minutos tornaram-se numa partida diferente. Só depois dos 80 minutos, o Manchester United mostrou rasgo, através do cada vez mais inevitável Amad Diallo, que voltou a aparecer e a ser o herói dos Red Devils , com três golos, plenos oportunidade, que valeram novo triunfo na Premier League.\nApesar dos três pontos, Ruben Amorim continua com uma tarefa muito complicada no comando técnico do Manchester United, com a equipa a subir ao 12.º lugar da Premier League, chegando aos 26 pontos, ainda longe dos lugares que dão acesso às competições europeias. Na próxima jornada, o Manchester United recebe o Brighton, nono classificado da Liga Inglesa de futebol.\nTópicos 'Manchester United','Ruben Amorim','Premier League','Amad Diallo','Southampton','Old Trafford','Theatre of Dreams','Teatro dos Sonhos' Quer partilhar este artigo? cancelar PUB PUB",
