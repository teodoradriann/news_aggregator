    "text": "Need to get warm all over? You’ll love Big Joe’s Hot Toddy\nThe weather here in Jersey has been damp, chilly, sometimes cold and the increase of flu-like symptoms have radiated throughout the Garden State.\nIt’s time to get warm, and it’s time to enjoy a big cup of Big Joe’s Hot Toddy.\nThe toddy was created for times like this, when people picked up the flu, cold or other respiratory ailments. The ingredients in the toddy will open the pathways of your sinuses and lungs to breathe better and ultimately aid in the rest that you may not be getting. I know it sounds like a commercial, but it works.\nI use it all the time when I’m feeling a little grunge creep up. It opens my voice so that I can effectively speak and gets rid of the phlegm, if only for a while.\nI know I sound like a snake oil salesman but I’m telling you it works for me. It really is a natural way to fight the chill of the weather and help cope with crud of the flu.\nBig Joe’s Hot Toddy is an alcoholic drink that is made with whiskey or bourbon. If you’re somebody who doesn’t drink, that’s ok: skip the liquor and increase the cloves, honey, and tea in the recipe.\nI originally introduced this recipe for the Polar Bear Plunge for Special Olympics New Jersey, which historically takes place on the last Saturday in February.\nAt the Polar Bear Plunge, scantily clad individuals who have raised big money take a dip into the 30-something-degree waters of the Atlantic to raise big money for Special Olympics New Jersey. It was Big Joe’s Hot Toddy that saved many after the plunge in helping them ward off the constant chills that their dip had caused.\nI’m telling you if there was a Nobel Prize for hot beverages that have helped humanity, this would be the winner.\nYou don’t have to plunge or have the flu to enjoy my hot toddy. You deserve it. Here’s what you need. Cheers!\nIngredients:\n1 bag of your favorite black tea 10 oz. of almost boiling water 1-2 oz. of Bourbon 1 wedge of orange\n6 or 7 whole cloves 1 tsp. of honey (Optional) Orange slice with whole cloves pushed into it Cinnamon Stick (Optional)\nHow to put it together:\nIn a kettle or small pot, heat the water just hot enough that it almost boils. In a large mug, pour hot water over the tea bag and let steep for 5 minutes. Remove the tea bag and discard.\nNow depending on how cold you are from diving into the icy waters of the Atlantic, add 1 - 2 oz. of your favorite Bourbon. Squeeze a wedge of orange into the tea and gently stir to incorporate everything.\nFor me the juice from the orange and the naturally sweet notes from the bourbon are sweet enough. If you want it a bit sweeter or if you have a sore throat, you can add a tsp. of honey. Garnish with a cinnamon stick and a slice of orange with 6 or 7 whole cloves pushed into it.\nEnjoy and feel the warmth start to return.\nFor more Big Joe recipes, click\nhere!\nLOOK: 35 Vintage Cereals That Perfectly Captured Pop Culture Moments\nGallery Credit: Rob Carroll\nThe post above reflects the thoughts and observations of New Jersey 101.5 weekend host Big Joe Henry.

Since midnight, an inch (2.5 centimeters) had fallen at an official measuring point in Central Park, the NWS said, adding that a total of 1.4 inches of accumulation were logged since the storm began on Monday. \"The streak has ended!\" it proclaimed. A municipal worker clears sidewalks of snow in Manhattan / © AFP Other parts of the city like Brooklyn were clearing the white stuff from sidewalks after a long holiday weekend. In the northern suburbs, some schools were closed and public transport had slight delays. New York -- home to 8.5 million people -- hadn't seen perceptible snow since early 2022. In other areas of New York state, like the Buffalo area, snowfall is a more regular and serious occurrence. At Christmas 2022, northern and western New York got more than four feet (one meter) of snow, and dozens of people died in the region. The frequency, intensity and unpredictability of snowfall in the United States, as in other parts of the world, has been affected by climate change.",

    "text": "Emirates announces partnership with Etihad Clean Energy Development Emirates has partnered with Etihad Clean Energy Development to launch a large-scale solar energy project at the Emirates Engineering Centre in Dubai to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability. The signing ceremony took place at the World Green Economy Summit 2024 in the presence of His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airline; and His Excellency Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, vice chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and managing director and CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). The project includes the development, engineering, procurement, construction, testing, and commissioning of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems at Emirates Engineering Centre, along with 20 years of operations and maintenance services. Emirates plans to install a total of 39,960 solar panels to provide 37 per cent of the facility’s annual energy consumption and reduce emissions by over 13,000 tonnes each year when fully operational. The total capacity is 23,177 kWp, with an estimated annual generation of 34,301,960 kWh. His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum said: “This initiative highlights Emirates’ commitment and continued investment in renewable energy solutions as part of our sustainability strategy. By integrating solar energy into the Emirates Engineering Centre, we are significantly reducing our carbon footprint while supporting the UAE’s clean energy goals. “We are pleased to partner with Etihad Clean Energy Development in this solar PV project, which adds another milestone in our sustainability journey and greatly expands the number of solar installations at our facilities.” His Excellency Saeed Al Mohammed Tayer said: “Etihad Clean Energy Development, a leading provider of energy efficiency solutions in the region, will spearhead the project, showcasing its expertise in delivering high-performance energy systems. Through this partnership, Etihad Clean Energy Development and Emirates Airline will ensure the long-term operational efficiency of the solar PV systems while achieving substantial reductions in carbon emissions and energy costs. “We are proud to collaborate with Emirates Airline on this landmark project. Our partnership not only supports the UAE’s vision for a sustainable future but also sets a precedent for renewable energy adoption in the aviation sector.” With a 20-year agreement for operation and maintenance, the solar PV systems will contribute to long-term environmental benefits, ensuring that the Emirates Engineering Centre continues to operate efficiently using clean energy. This project is part of both companies’ broader efforts to support the UAE’s sustainability agenda, which focuses on reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources and driving progress towards a low-carbon future.

    "text": "The Florida Power & Light Company ( FPL ) has brought power back for almost 1.3 million customers who lost service due to Hurricane Milton.\nMilton’s impact on the power grid was severe. At its peak, the storm knocked out power for nearly 3.4 million Floridians using various service providers across the state. As of the noon update from the Florida Public Service Commission, just over 667,000 FPL customers remained without power, meaning the company has already restored service for around two-thirds of those affected after landfall late Wednesday.\nThe company says approximately 85,000 people still without power are living in communities impacted by the storm’s rampant tornado activity .\n“Our hardened grid and smart technology prevented hundreds of thousands of outages,” said FPL President and CEO Armando Pimentel in a prepared statement.\n“Our restoration crews have made significant progress in the first 24 hours of the storm leaving Florida — restoring power to nearly 1.3 million customers. We understand how difficult it is to be without power, and we are committed to getting every customer’s lights back on as soon as possible.”\nFPL has continued being proactive to prepare for storms as the state has dealt with back-to-back strikes. Prior to Helene , FPL positioned workers to be able to respond as soon as it was safe to do so, allowing them to work quickly to restore service .\nBut Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the process would be more difficult with Hurricane Milton due to the many electrical workers still assisting in post-Helene recovery — not just in Florida, but throughout the South.\nBringing in workers from out of state is a staple to assist in natural disasters. But many of those workers are still being utilized elsewhere, with Helene striking less than two weeks before Milton.\nNevertheless, FPL amassed a workforce of 20,000 made up of workers from 41 states. FPL plans to provide an additional update on its progress later Friday.",

    "text": "Una tragedia durante le festività natalizie è accaduta a Monterotondo, Comune in provincia di Roma: una famiglia è distrutta dopo aver perso il proprio figlio di appena due anni (compiuti pochi mesi fa) per aver ingerito una parte di un giocattolo. A nulla è servita la corsa in ospedale, al Policlinico Gemelli, dove è morto quest'oggi.\nLa dinamica dell'incidente La sera del 26 dicembre una famiglia di origine moldava che lavora nella piccola cittadina alle porte della Capitale stava giocando con il proprio figlio prima di andare a dormire ed è in quel momento che si è consumato il dramma: per cause ancora da accertare il piccolo ha ingoiato una parte del giocattolo con cui giocava abitualmente. Appena padre e madre si sono accorti di quanto fosse accaduto hanno chiamato i soccorsi: un elicottero lo ha trasportato d'urgenza al Gemelli (dove è arrivato in arresto cardiaco) per provare a guadagnare tempo ma in un giorno e mezzo i medici non sono riusciti a salvarlo e il piccolo si è spento nelle scorse ore.\nSulla vicenda indagano i carabinieri della compagnia di Monterotondo che hanno inzialmente supportato le fasi di soccorso e avvisato l'autorità giudiziaria competente. Come detto, si cerca di capire come sia possibile che sia avvenuta la tragedia provando a ricostruire l'esatta dinamica dell'incidente e capire eventuali responsabilità: sotto la lente di ingrandimento anche il giocattolo (e l'azienda che lo produce) per comprendere se la parte ingerita per errore si stacchi dallo stesso, se fosse rotta e se comunque il gioco fosse adatto a un bimbo di appena due anni. Nelle prossime ore i genitori saranno interrogati affinché possano fornire la loro versione circa l'accaduto.\nTragedia sfiorata in Sicilia Una storia a lieto fine ma molto simile alla vicenda di Monterotondo è capitata in Sicilia un paio di settimane fa quando un bimbo di soli otto mesi ha rischiato di morire soffocato dopo aver ingoiato la parte di un gioco che era stata masticata dal proprio cane. Appena la madre si è accorto di quanto accaduto ha chiamato subito i soccorsi ed è stato salvato grazie all'equipe dell'ospedale Cannizzaro di Catania che ha dovuto eseguire una tracheotomia. A nulla erano valse le manovre della madre nel disperato tentativo di fargli fuoriuscire la parte ingerita: a quel punto l'ospedale era l'unica soluzione. Dopo l'intervento il piccolo ha avuto un edema alle vie aeree superiori rimanendo in terapia intensiva per molti giorni: anche se ha compiuto il nono mese di vita in ospedale, il Santo Natale lo ha trascorso felice e sereno a casa con la sua famiglia.",
