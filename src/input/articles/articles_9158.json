    "text": "For 35 years, a devotee in Barangay San Pedro Cutud in San Fernando, Pampanga has been demonstrating his faith by reenacting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\nRuben Enaje was among those who were nailed to the cross for the Good Friday tradition, according to Chino Gaston’s report on “24 Oras”.\n“Di ko pa masabi sa ngayon. Kung sa susunod na taon wala pang makita, ewan ko na lang. Basta kaya ng katawan ko,” Enaje said.\n(I still cannot say by now. If they can’t find anyone to replace me next year then I’ll continue. I will do it as long as my body permits.)\nThe local government of Cutud said at least 20,000 visitors flocked to the crucifixion site to witness the annual tradition. Some of them are foreigners who went to the province to watch the crucifixion.\n“Faith is super strong. People can sacrifice themselves to this extent,” a foreign national said.\nIn Tondo, Manila dozens of half-naked devotees went around six parishes, whipping their backs until they were bloody in a religious ritual that they said would help take away their sins.\nMany Filipino Catholics go through religious penance during Holy Week as a form of worship and prayer believed to grant their wishes, cleanse their sins, and cure illnesses.\nFather Randy Flores said there was no need to hurt oneself to get forgiveness from God.\n“Labag po yan sa paggalang sa sarili, sa katawan bilang templo ng Espiritu Santo… Emulate yung halimbawa ng ginawa Niya. Apply ang Kaniyang mga itinuro na mahalin ang kapwa katulad ng pagmamahal sa sarili,” said Fr. Flores.\n(It’s against respect for themselves, their bodies as a temple of the Holy Spirit… We should emulate His example. Apply what He taught us about loving our fellows as we love ourselves)\nThe Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines also earlier said that while it does not condone the tradition, it also does not endorse the activity.\nIn Boracay, residents and visitors joined the traditional Way of the Cross or Via Crucis to commemorate Jesus' passion and death on the cross.\nThe local government earlier ordered a ban on loud music for the entire Good Friday on the popular resort island.\nIn Quiapo, Manila, at least 700,000 flocked to the church to observe Good Friday.\nAccording to Sandra Aguinaldo's \"24 Oras report\", some of the attendees joined the early morning procession of the image of the Black Nazarene, while others reflected on the Seven Last Words of Christ at the church before attending the Holy Mass.\nThe devotees endured the warm and humid weather and scattered rains to join the procession of the \"Santo Entierro.\"\n\"Dito na tayo humuhugot ng lakas ...wala naman tayong aasahan kundi 'yung nasa taas (This is where we draw our strength ...we don't have anyone else to rely on except on the one up there),\" Ronaldo Mariano, a devotee, said. —Sundy Locus\\/LDF, GMA Integrated News",

A plataforma forneceu comentários esclarecedores sobre a vida no escritório e uma maneira para freelancers se promoverem e fazerem networking. Agora, muitos estão abandonando um recurso de carreira e questionando onde mais podem encontrar os benefícios então oferecidos pela rede.\nOrganizações como Balenciaga e The Guardian também se retiraram. Em um editorial, o jornal afirmou que a eleição presidencial dos EUA sublinhou o que o gigante do jornalismo considerava há muito. \"O X é uma plataforma de mídia tóxica e seu proprietário, Elon Musk, tem sido capaz de usar sua influência para moldar o discurso político\".\nEm resposta, apoiadores de Musk criticaram as saídas como birras de progressistas. O X não respondeu ao pedido de comentário.\nFolha Mercado Receba no seu email o que de mais importante acontece na economia; aberta para não assinantes.\nCarregando...\nDo ponto de vista do trabalho, James O'Brien, apresentador de rádio da LBC e autor, disse que X se tornou menos produtivo, com poucas respostas de boa fé e \"esgoto priorizado em seu feed em vez de pessoas que você realmente poderia achar interessantes\". Para aqueles que valorizam \"interação, pluralidade de opiniões e boas maneiras\", ele disse, \"tornou-se quase intolerável\". Ele agora está postando mais frequentemente no Bluesky, uma plataforma mais nova que se beneficiou de um aumento no uso à medida que as pessoas saíram do X.\nRhett Butler, diretor executivo da Mongabay, uma organização ambiental sem fins lucrativos, diz que começou a ver benefícios decrescentes em publicar no Twitter em novembro de 2022, um mês após Musk comprá-lo. Além de uma queda no engajamento, houve \"mais interações negativas, acusações de viés e outras dinâmicas desafiadoras\" que \"tornaram a plataforma menos tolerável para a equipe que a gerencia\".\nO LinkedIn surgiu como uma alternativa preferida. \"Como uma organização sem fins lucrativos, priorizamos entender quem consome nossos relatórios e como eles usam essa informação, em vez de focar apenas nos números de tráfego\", diz Butler. Tatiana Prowell, oncologista, historicamente usou o Twitter para compartilhar conhecimento sobre câncer. Durante a pandemia, ela o usou para destacar dados emergentes, ajudando o \"público e meus colegas a se manterem informados\". Ela co-fundou Healthcare Workers vs Hunger (@HCWvsHunger), uma competição amigável que arrecadou mais de US$ 2,3 milhões (R$ 13,4 milhões) para bancos de alimentos.\nAgora ela também começou a postar no Bluesky. \"Parece mais com o Twitter de alguns anos atrás. As trocas eram mais produtivas e a atmosfera era mais positiva\", diz Prowell. Mas ela permanecerá no X, porque pode ouvir os pacientes e \"as pessoas merecem ciência e informações de saúde confiáveis, equilibradas e compreensíveis\".\nOutras entidades com deveres cívicos tomaram uma decisão diferente. A força policial do Norte de Gales saiu do Twitter, porque estava \"se tornando cada vez mais difícil comunicar informações oportunas, factuais e relevantes\", de acordo com a chefe de polícia Amanda Blakeman. Patrick Hurley, um membro do parlamento britânico, acredita que o X agora promove \"uma agenda em desacordo com os valores do povo britânico, e encoraja cliques através da raiva\". Ele acha o Facebook e o Nextdoor mais úteis para alcançar os constituintes, e o Bluesky para formadores de opinião e pares.\nElon Musk pediu impeachment de Moraes e estimulou manifestações em 7 de Setembro ic_save\nMais\nic_share\nLeia Mais Ícone fechar Voltar Ver novamente Voltar\nVoltar\nCompartilhe Ícone Facebook Facebook Ícone Whatsapp Whatsapp Ícone X\nX Ícone de messenger Messenger Ícone Linkedin Linkedin Ícone de envelope E-mail Ícone de link Cadeado representando um link Copiar link Ícone fechar\nEmbora possam perder grandes audiências ao deixar o X, alguns criativos acreditam que não têm escolha: não é mais adequado para o propósito. \"Minha sensação é que a natureza tóxica do X trabalha contra o desejo de espalhar alegria através da leitura\", diz Jonny Geller, diretor executivo da agência de talentos Curtis Brown Group. O romancista John Niven coloca de forma direta: \"Seu uso [para] feeds de notícias e promoção de livros não compensa mais atravessar um oceano de sujeira\".\nO escritor de comédia Jon Harvey, mais conhecido como Count Binface, acredita que a enxurrada de \"conteúdo indesejado\" teve um efeito material no networking e na geração de ideias. \"Muito do que faço é reativo, improvisando com base no que vejo no meu feed\", ele diz. \"À medida que o algoritmo se tornou mais pernicioso, eu estava vendo muito mais tweets de usuários que não seguia.\"\nPorém, enquanto muitos migraram, encontrar audiências e oportunidades pode ser mais difícil em outras plataformas. A blogueira de moda Camille Charrière, que tem mais de 1 milhão de seguidores no Instagram, saiu do X após a eleição nos EUA, mas sente falta de uma plataforma baseada em texto. \"No Instagram, sinto-me como uma influenciadora de moda. No X, eu conseguia me conectar com pessoas que não me viam assim.\"\nA oportunidade de desafiar perspectivas é uma perda, diz Harvey. \"Por mais que o Bluesky pareça um novo começo para muitas pessoas, provavelmente há um preço a pagar se diferentes seções da sociedade se retirarem para seus espaços seguros.\"\ndê um conteúdo benefício do assinante\nVocê tem 7 acessos por dia para dar de presente.

    "text": "Chemotherapy response in colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits significant heterogeneity, with current clinical predictors failing to capture complex genomic determinants of resistance. We developed a hybrid deep learning framework integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks to analyze whole-genome somatic mutations, evolutionary conservation, chromatin accessibility, and 3D genome architecture in 2,546 TCGA patients. An attention mechanism identified predictive genomic regions. The model achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89–0.94) in cross-validation and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91) in independent validation, outperforming clinical models (ΔAUC = +0.18, p <0.001). Key predictors included non-coding variants in TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA regulatory regions. Triple-positive patients (mutations in all 3 regions) had significantly worse progression free survival (HR = 4.7, p < 0.001). Our framework enables accurate chemotherapy response prediction and reveals novel non-coding resistance mechanisms, advancing precision oncology in CRC.",

    "text": "By Sam Barron | Thursday, 06 June 2024 03:37 PM EDT The Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC is rescinding its endorsement of former Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., NBC News reported. Jones, who served in Congress for one term before losing his seat due to redistricting is running for another term in New York's 17th Congressional District, which represents suburban New York counties. A progressive darling when he ran in 2020, Jones has earned the ire of that caucus with his endorsement of Westchester County Executive George Latimer, who is primarying Squad member Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., in the state’s 16th Congressional District, which represents parts of Westchester and the Bronx. Jones has criticized Bowman for his anti-Israel rhetoric, including denying Hamas committed sexual assaults when it attacked the country on Oct. 7. Latimer has campaigned on his steadfast support for Israel. \"I have no regrets about standing up for what I firmly believe in,\" Jones said. \"I have known and worked with George Latimer for years. Rep. Bowman and I have very different views on Israel.\" Jones, who is challenging Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said Jewish residents have expressed anxiety, anger, and fear due to Bowman's actions. \"I will always stand up for my Jewish constituents,\" Jones said. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Progressive Caucus in Congress told NBC News Jones' endorsement of Latimer was \"horrific.\" \"Honestly, I'm just so disgusted by it,\" Jayapal said. \"This is a former colleague of his, an incumbent member who is a top-priority candidate for us, an incumbent for us in the Progressive Caucus.\" Jayapal believes Jones endorsed Latimer because it was politically expedient. \"It's not the way we operate as progressives,\" Jayapal said. Lawler echoed Jayapal's comments in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"The reality is @MondaireJones is one of them and agrees with them on nearly every issue,\" Jones said. \"Losing their endorsement doesn't change that. He chose political expediency over standing up for his principles and they see it for what it is.\" Sam Barron has almost two decades of experience covering a wide range of topics including politics, crime and business. © 2024 Newsmax.

    "text": "Temperatura\nEl año 2024, el más cálido desde que existen registros\nSe trata del primer año con una temperatura media 1,5°C por encima del nivel preindustrial\nEFE\nEl año 2024 fue el más [cálido](/tags/calor/) documentado a nivel global desde que hay registros y el primero en que la temperatura media superó en 1,5°C el nivel preindustrial, informó este viernes el Servicio de Cambio Climático de Copernicus (C3S), el programa de observación de la Tierra de la Unión Europea.\nEl año pasado la [temperatura](/tags/temperaturas/) media del aire en superficie fue de 15,10ºC, lo que supone 0,72ºC por encima de la temperatura media entre 1991 y 2020, y 0,12°C más que en 2023, el anterior año más cálido de los registros, que se remontan a 1850, según informó este viernes esta institución con sede en Bonn (Alemania). Esto equivale a 1,60ºC por encima de la estimación de la temperatura entre 1850 y 1900, considerado el periodo preindustrial.\n\"La humanidad es dueña de su destino, pero nuestra respuesta al [desafío climático](/tags/crisis-climatica/) debe basarse en pruebas. El futuro está en nuestras manos; una acción rápida y decisiva aún puede cambiar la trayectoria de nuestro clima futuro\", recalcó Carlo Buontempo, director del Servicio de Cambio Climático de Copernicus del Centro Europeo de Previsiones Meteorológicas a Plazo Medio (CEPMPM).\nLa temperatura media mensual superó en 1,5°C los niveles preindustriales durante once meses del año y yendo más atrás, todos los meses desde julio de 2023, e excepción de julio de 2024, superaron este umbral. Además, todos los meses de enero a junio fueron más cálidos que el mismo mes de cualquier año anterior y todos los meses de julio a diciembre fueron el segundo más cálido, por detrás del correspondiente de 2023. Agosto de 2024 empató con agosto de 2023 como el más cálido registrado.\n\"Cada año de la última década es uno de los diez más cálidos registrados. Estamos ya a punto de superar el nivel de 1,5°C definido en el Acuerdo de París y la media de los dos últimos años ya está por encima\", señaló Samantha Burguess, responsable estratégica de Clima del CEPMPM.\nOlas de calor sin precedentes y lluvias torrenciales\nAgregó que \"estas altas temperaturas globales, unidas a niveles récord de vapor de agua en la atmósfera mundial en 2024, se tradujeron en olas de calor sin precedentes y episodios de lluvias torrenciales, que han causado sufrimiento a millones de personas\".\nEl año 2024 fue el más cálido para todos los continentes, excepto la Antártida y Australasia, así como para partes considerables de los océanos, en particular el Atlántico Norte, el Índico y el Pacífico occidental.\nEn lo que respecta a Europa, la temperatura media en 2024 se situó en 10,69°C, 1,47°C por encima de la media en el periodo de referencia entre 1991 y 2020 y 0,28°C más cálida que el récord anterior establecido en 2020.\nMientras, la temperatura media anual de la superficie del mar sobre el océano extrapolar alcanzó un máximo histórico de 20,87°C, 0,51°C por encima de la media de entre 1991 y 2020.\nLas altas temperaturas de la superficie del mar fueron uno de los factores que más influyeron en la prevalencia de las altas temperaturas mundiales en 2023 y 2024.\nHumedad récord\nLa cantidad total de vapor de agua en la atmósfera alcanzó un valor récord en 2024, al situarse un 5% por encima de la media de entre 1991 y 2020 y más de un 1% por encima de los años 2016 y 2023, en los que se habían registrado los dos valores más altos, respectivamente. Este abundante volumen de humedad amplificó el potencial de precipitaciones extremas y combinado con las altas temperaturas de la superficie del mar, contribuyó al desarrollo de grandes tormentas y ciclones tropicales.\nLas temperaturas extremas y la elevada humedad pueden contribuir a aumentar los niveles de estrés térmico: a lo largo de 2024, gran parte del Hemisferio norte experimentó más días que la media con, al menos, \"fuerte estrés térmico\" y algunas zonas registraron más días que la media con \"estrés térmico extremo\", nivel en el que es imprescindible tomar medidas para evitar un golpe de calor.\nEl 10 de julio de 2024, alrededor del 44% de la superficie del planeta se vio afectada por un \"estrés térmico\" entre \"fuerte\" y \"extremo\", lo que supone un nuevo máximo anual récord y un 5% más de superficie del planeta en comparación con el máximo anual medio.\nPor otra parte, los prolongados periodos secos en varias regiones generaron condiciones propicias para incendios forestales, que en el continente americano fueron persistentes y a gran escala. En cuanto a las emisiones de carbono de los incendios forestales, Bolivia y Venezuela tuvieron los niveles más altos jamás registrados.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=El%20a%C3%B1o%202024%2C%20el%20m%C3%A1s%20c%C3%A1lido%20desde%20que%20existen%20registros%20https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/sociedad/2025/01/10/ano-2024-calido-existen-registros-113261701.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/sociedad/2025/01/10/ano-2024-calido-existen-registros-113261701.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/sociedad/2025/01/10/ano-2024-calido-existen-registros-113261701.html&text=El%20a%C3%B1o%202024%2C%20el%20m%C3%A1s%20c%C3%A1lido%20desde%20que%20existen%20registros%20%20https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/sociedad/2025/01/10/ano-2024-calido-existen-registros-113261701.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40opiniondemalaga)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=El%20a%C3%B1o%202024%2C%20el%20m%C3%A1s%20c%C3%A1lido%20desde%20que%20existen%20registros%20&body=https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/sociedad/2025/01/10/ano-2024-calido-existen-registros-113261701.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "title": "Présence russe en Afrique : la reprise en main de Vladimir Poutine",
    "text": "Deux jours avant de disparaître dans le crash de son jet, Evgueni Prigojine a laissé un testament. Ce 21 août 2023, le patron du groupe de mercenaires russes Wagner, qui n’avait plus donné signe de vie depuis sa rébellion avortée contre le Kremlin deux mois plus tôt, diffuse une vidéo sur les réseaux sociaux. « Tout va bien. Je me trouve en Afrique. Nous embauchons de vrais héros et continuons de remplir les tâches qui nous ont été confiées », lâche-t-il, la mine impassible au milieu d’un paysage désertique. En treillis, engoncé dans un gilet pare-balles, une arme automatique à la main, Evgueni Prigojine appelle les volontaires à rejoindre Wagner, pour « rendre l’Afrique plus libre ». Le message semble aussi adressé à son ex-allié, le président russe, Vladimir Poutine, comme pour signifier à celui qui le qualifie désormais de « traître » que sa disgrâce s’arrête aux frontières russes. En Afrique, son empire militaire, commercial et informationnel, bâti depuis 2017 dans quatre pays – le Soudan à l’est, la Libye au nord, le Mali à l’ouest et la Centrafrique –, est bien ancré. Il ne sait pas encore que son voyage en Afrique est le dernier. Le Kremlin n’a attendu que deux jours après les funérailles d’Evgueni Prigojine pour s’octroyer son legs le plus précieux. Le 31 août 2023, un avion militaire décolle de Moscou en direction du continent africain. A son bord, le vice-ministre de la défense, Iounous-bek Evkourov, et le général Andreï Averianov, un commandant du GRU, la direction du renseignement militaire russe. Les deux hommes ont été missionnés par Vlamidir Poutine. La méthode Wagner, au service des ambitions russes en Afrique La consigne dictée tient compte des erreurs du passé. « Pour ne pas perdre à nouveau le contrôle opérationnel d’une formation armée, les autorités russes ont décidé de séparer clairement les composantes commerciale, propagandiste et militaire de l’ancien empire Prigojine », analysent les chercheurs Filip Bryjka et Jedrzej Czerep, coauteurs d’un rapport sur la stratégie africaine de la Russie à l’Institut polonais des affaires internationales. Sous la houlette du ministère de la défense, trois services de renseignement ont la tâche de récupérer et de faire prospérer les différentes branches de Wagner : le GRU se charge des paramilitaires, le FSB, les services russes de sécurité, du réseau de propagande, et le SVR, le renseignement extérieur, de l’influence culturelle. Le Burkina Faso est en tête des priorités du Kremlin. Le 31 août, Iounous-bek Evkourov et Andreï Averianov débarquent sur le tarmac de l’aéroport de Ouagadougou. A la présidence, le capitaine Ibrahim Traoré, putschiste au pouvoir depuis septembre 2022 , les attend. Dans un des salons d’honneur, la rencontre entre les deux délégations est chaleureuse.
