    "title": "Ex-Arsenal scout lifts lid on failing to convince Kylian Mbappe to make Gunners -",
    "text": "Former Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi has admitted not convincing Kylian Mbappe to join the Gunners is his biggest disappointment from his 15 years in the role.\nGrimandi, who made 169 appearances for Arsenal during his playing career, joined the Gunners as a scout in 2006 after being linked with the director of football position at the Emirates.\nAnd in his time at the Gunners, Grimandi looked to strike a deal for Mbappe when the forward was 14 and playing for AS Bondy. However, Mbappe instead decided to join Monaco.\nMbappe has since gone on to become one of the greatest footballers on the planet, after moving to Paris Saint-Germain, with the club eventually paying £156million for his services.\nReflecting on his failed move to sign Mbappe, Grimandi exclusively told Ladbrokes Fanzone: \"I don't know whether Kylian Mbappe is a realistic target for Arsenal, even if the club wins the Premier League and has a strong season in Europe. We tried to convince him before, in 2016. We met his parents in London who came to the training ground and alongside Arsene and Richard Law we travelled to meet Kylian in the South of France.\n\"We tried to convince him, but I don't think it was the best time for us; that meeting took place the day after we'd just lost to Swansea at home in the League, which itself followed a defeat at Old Trafford and I remember we had a big game away just three days later against Tottenham , so the timing was not ideal.\n\"We tried, and I really don't think we were far from getting him, but he declined the project and signed a new deal with Monaco. I'd say it is probably the biggest disappointment in my 15 years as an Arsenal scout, not convincing Kylian Mbappe to sign for the club.\n\"Kylian is the kind of player who can change a club, that's for sure. There aren't so many of those players in the world, it might happen once in your life as a scout or as a manager; signing someone who changes your club, and we just missed out on Mbappe all those years ago.\"\n‌Mbappe has been in stunning form for Paris Saint-Germain so far this season and has scored 21 goals in 22 appearances in 2023/24. The 25-year-old's record for the Ligue 1 champions over the years is remarkable, and that has seen him heavily linked with moves to Real Madrid and the Premier League.\nGrimandi believes the \"best clubs\" in world football should all be trying to sign Mbappe. He added: \"Looking ahead, the best clubs in the world, in which you have to include the English trio of Arsenal, Liverpool , Manchester City , should all be trying to sign him because he's a very special talent, and there's a great opportunity for someone to sign him on a free transfer.\n‌\"However, my instinct is that he has a love for Real Madrid and also we have to remember that PSG will be very keen that he remains in Paris, so I do not believe he will arrive at Arsenal, but it would be great if he did of course. It would be quite something to see Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe playing in the same division, especially if Mbappe was playing at Arsenal.\"\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

Cualquiera puede ser víctima de un atentado”,\nEn efecto, el sentimiento antisemita, que ya reportaba un preocupante incremento en años anteriores, aumenta tras la escalada militar israelí en la Franja de Gaza, donde las autoridades del gobierno de Hamás, que rige esa zona palestina, aseguran que más de 20.000 civiles han muerto durante los bombardeos en las últimas semanas.\n“Hay que entender que se trata de una lucha por salvar al mundo libre”, sostuvo el vicecónsul.\n“Si los israelíes no lo hacemos ahora, el grupo terrorista Hamás seguirá expandiéndose a otros países y hará tanto o más de lo que hizo el 7 de octubre en Israel”, subrayó.",

    "text": "The northern lights were amazing last night over Michigan. The experts at forecasting northern lights say they are again possible.\nThe wording from NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is not as confident on strong northern lights tonight. They do say we will likely have northern lights, but give the various levels of northern lights a lesser chance than last night.\nAt 2:30 p.m. today SWPC said, “A G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storm watch remains in effect for 11 Oct as CME effects continue to diminish. A G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm watch is in place for 12 Oct due to lingering CME influences in addition to the possibility of relatively weak coronal hole high speed stream effects.”\nIn other words we should attempt again tonight to watch for northern lights. The Kp Index is usually a good way to tell how expansive the northern lights will be on a given night. Last night the Kp Index shot up to a very high Kp=9.\nHere is the current Kp Index forecast for today through Sunday night.\nThe Kp Index for tonight is in the bottom left column of numbers and the top numbers in the center column. Notice SWPC shows the Kp Index lowering through the night. the Kp Index for tonight is expected to start at Kp=6.0 and drop to Kp=5.33 during the middle of the night. This would imply the best chance to see northern lights will be late this evening.\nThe sky will be clear enough to see the northern lights for most of Michigan. There is a thicker patch of clouds across northern Lower Michigan as of 4:00 p.m. Those clouds will drift south and may stretch across central Lower late this evening. As the clouds drift into central Lower Michigan they will clear out of northern Lower Michigan. So some of us may have clouds that would obscure northern lights.\nGenerally it is thought we will have northern lights again tonight, but not to the extent of last night.\nGood luck.\nYou can see many great images from last night on our [Michigan Weather Facebook Group].",
