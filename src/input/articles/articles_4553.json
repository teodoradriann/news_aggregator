    "text": "Guest pen | International pressure for peace negotiations, where concessions are expected from Ukraine, may increase already in the near future.\nin Ukraine has been wrested from peace since Russia occupied the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and fueled the separatists’ activities in eastern Ukraine. The Minsk agreements concluded in September 2014 and February 2015 did not bring peace or even a lasting ceasefire, and the war of positions continued. The agreements were buried in the scrap heap of history with Russia’s large-scale attack in February 2022.\nIn the early stages of the war, Russia and Ukraine sent their delegations to Belarus for “quick” peace negotiations. Negotiations continued in Istanbul and remotely. The Russians demanded the surrender of Ukraine, even though in the spring of 2022 the Ukrainians managed to repel the Russians’ plans to subjugate the entire country to their will.\nThe Ukrainians had no reason to trust the sincerity of the Russians demanding the reduction of the armed forces, when Ukraine lacked international security guarantees comparable to the fifth article of NATO. In addition, Ukraine’s military capabilities strengthened by international support shine a light on the belief that concessions that already undermine the possibility of lasting peace are not necessary.\nAlthough Ukraine succeeded in repelling Russian plans to suppress the country’s independence, hopes of Ukraine’s chances of achieving a complete military victory over Russia have weakened. In the protracted consumer war, size matters. The international support Ukraine has received has not been enough to expel the Russian troops from Ukraine. Russia’s resilience to losses has surprised.\nAs the war dragged on and the frontline situation stalled, both Ukraine and Russia have expressed that they are ready to negotiate peace only on their own terms. Both practically require the surrender of the other party.\nThe parties the willingness to negotiate is mainly influenced by the perception of power relations and their development.\n“\nBoth require the surrender of the other party.\nIn Russia, there is hardly any willingness to make significant concessions if the government believes that it can improve its positions by continuing the war. Ukraine’s demands for a just peace are morally understandable but unrealistic when Russia occupies almost a fifth of Ukraine. As the underdog, Ukraine should not negotiate peace terms where territorial concessions and restrictions on the right to self-determination and the ability to defend the country raise doubts about the peace. It explains the Ukrainian attack across the border at Kursk.\nIn the current situation continuing the war may seem like the best option for both sides in principle, when all the options are miserable. There is no point in waiting for a negotiated solution as long as the parties have the will and ability to continue the war.\nUkraine’s willingness to negotiate is mainly influenced by internal politics. President Volodymyr Zelenskyi is dependent on public opinion. According to opinion polls, the majority of Ukrainians support the continuation of the resistance.\nEven if the Ukrainians want to continue fighting, they must take into account the demands of the country’s supporters. International pressure on peace negotiations may increase already in the near future.\nLike Russia, Ukraine also wants to dictate what will ultimately be negotiated in future peace talks. However, Ukraine, which is dependent on external support, can less afford to appear as an obstacle to peace than Russia.\nUkrainian supporters need to decide as soon as possible whether the best option now is to help Ukraine force Russia into negotiations in which Ukraine must also make concessions, and then ensure that Russia does not continue the war later.\nThere is also no solution for how the verification works. It is difficult to promise Ukraine credible security guarantees, unless the supporters have a desire to fight for Ukraine.\nIlmari Käihkö is a visiting researcher at the Aleksanteri Institute of the University of Helsinki.

    "title": "Trump says calamitous Afghanistan withdrawal set off wars around world",
    "text": "By John Haughey\nContributing Writer\nFormer President Donald Trump said the carnage that unfolded on Aug. 26, 2021, at Kabul’s airport set the stage for “all these wars starting all over the place,” putting the planet “very close to a third world war.”\n“Since the Afghanistan catastrophe, it’s been open season on America and our allies,” Trump said during a 70-minute stump Wednesday at Asheboro Regional Airport in North Carolina.\nDuring the United States’ evacuation from Afghanistan, a terrorist bombing killed nearly 200 people, including 13 U.S. Marines and soldiers.\nTrump blamed the catastrophe and its fallout squarely on President Joe Biden and 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, describing it as “the most humiliating event in the history of our country.”\nHis address featured little policy, other than ensuring that the nation’s military remains the world’s strongest. He compared the relative peace of his 2016-2020 tenure with what has unfolded since.\n“We defeated ISIS, we killed the world’s top terrorists. We secured our borders. We achieved energy independence. We stood up to China, we protected Israel. We made peace in the Middle East with the Abraham accords,” he said.\nIf elected, Trump said he’d end the Russia-Ukraine war before being inaugurated.\nThe rally was his second in seven days in North Carolina. At an Aug. 14 rally in Asheville, he discussed his economic platform. He also campaigned in Charlotte on July 24, three days after Biden dropped out of the race.\nNorth Carolina is a key purple state, with 7.6 million registered voters and 16 electoral votes.\nAs of Aug. 17, the state’s Board of Elections had recorded more registered Democrats — 2.4 million — than the 2.27 million signed on with the GOP. The state’s 2.85 million unaffiliated voters are the target of both campaigns.\nTrump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 3.6% in 2016 and Biden by 1.34% in 2020 in the state.\nAn Aug. 9-Aug. 14 New York Times/Siena College poll of 655 North Carolinians showed Harris leading Trump, 49% to 47%.\nMost handicappers rate the state as “lean Republican,” although Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball has reclassified the race as a tossup.\nIncompetents Will Be Fired\nTrump said if he had been in the White House for the past four years, the world would be a safer place.\nRussia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine “would have never happened,” he said, and neither would Israel have been attacked by Hamas last year.\nTrump said he had gotten along with China during his tenure. “[But] what’s happening right now? They’re planning an attack on Taiwan,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Iran is building a nuclear weapon, he said.\nYet he wouldn’t need military force to dissuade adversaries. “Mostly,” he said, “I can do it with a telephone call.”\nThe former president said Harris was pivotal in the “Afghanistan catastrophe,” noting she “bragged she would be the last person in the room and she was — she was the last person in the room with Biden when [they] decided to pull the troops out of Afghanistan.”\nHe said the $85 billion in equipment left behind by the United States had made the Taliban “one of the largest arms merchants anywhere in the world.”\nPentagon officials have noted in hearings that the equipment belonged to Afghanistan’s armed forces, having been provided as congressionally approved military assistance during the 21-year war.\n“China is occupying” Bagram Air Base, Trump said, noting he would have retained the base — a recent nuance.\nWhile there are no Chinese troops currently occupying the base, Chinese jets have used it, and Chinese military trainers have been allegedly sighted there, Pentagon officials have acknowledged in congressional hearings since 2022.\nBy noon on Inauguration Day, Trump said, he would demand “the resignations of every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster,” a “house cleaning” that would “be a signal to the entire world.”\nBut first things first. “Comrade Harris,” he said, “you’re fired.”",
