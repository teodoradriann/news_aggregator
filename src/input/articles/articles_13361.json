    "text": "Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible which could produce large hail and strong winds. Expect heavy rainfall and lightning. ABILENE, Texas — A classic Abilene restaurant closed its doors for the final time Thursday after almost 28 years of service. Gloria Hermosillo, owner of Gloria's Grill, loves to cook. She said she has enjoyed being able to provide a good burger in a good atmosphere. Hermosillo said opening her own restaurant was a dream come true. “I thought I’ll put out the best burger in town,” said Hermosillo. “I never dreamed it would be as tremendous and as great as it’s been.” The business announced its plan to close on Facebook, saying their last day of service would be March 21. Since that announcement, Hermosillo said there has been a huge outpouring of support from the community, with everyone wanting to eat one last burger. “I wanted to bring my friends from Triumph Public High Schools to eat with us here on the last day of Gloria’s, and to get my final chili cheese burger,\" said customer Brian Florence. There was a line out the door on their last day of business. “It was taking people an hour, hour and a half wait just to get to the counter and order, and then again probably another hour and a half two hours to get their food,... and people waited,\" said Hermosillo. “The food and the fellowship, it’s just you know they’re good people,\" said customer Jimmie Graham. \"We’re gonna miss them.” A new chapter begins for Hermosillo now. “We’re retiring,\" she said. \"It’s time to retire.” She has hopes of traveling, spending more time with family, and taking it easy. “My granddaughter, the first thing she asked is 'Will you have lunch with me?' I said 'yes, I can go have lunch now.'\" Hermosillo said she is going to miss her fellow friends. “I’m one of the few restaurants that remembers her customers, remembers their names,\" she said. \"I remember if they’re not here on a day they’re supposed to be here.” The closure of Gloria’s Grill will certainly be felt by those who made eating here a part of their lives. “Happy town for them and sad town for us, but I understand and I just wanted to try it the last day,\" said customer Danny Graham. \"Gotta get my Gloria’s burger and it’s the best burger in Abilene.” Hermosillo said she is thankful for all of the support from the community the past 27 years. “I’m very honored to have been able to serve them.”",

    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "An unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability against Palo Alto Networks’ internet-exposed firewall management interfaces is actively being exploited, according to the cybersecurity provider.\nOn November 8, Palo Alto published a security advisory to warn of a zero-day vulnerability affecting some of its PAN-OS firewall management interfaces.\nThe flaw is an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability affecting internet-exposed new-generation firewall (NGFW) internet management interfaces.\nCVSS Score of 9.3 Although the vulnerability has not yet been allocated a CVE, Palo Alto assessed it as critical, with a CVSS of 9.3.\nHowever, the vulnerability only affects public-facing NGFW management interfaces. The manufacturer believes neither Prisma Access nor Cloud NGFW are affected.\n“If the management interface access is restricted to IPs, the risk of exploitation is greatly limited, as any potential attack would first require privileged access to those IPs. CVSS for this scenario is 7.5 High,” added the company.\nWhile Palo Alto did not initially mention any threat activity related to this new vulnerability, the firm updated its advisory on November 14 to confirm it has now observed in-the-wild exploitation.\nRead more about Palo Alto zero-days: Palo Alto Networks Warns About Critical Zero-Day in PAN-OS\nPalo Alto Working on a Patch Palo Alto informed customers that it is actively developing patches and threat prevention signatures, which are expected to be released soon.\n“We strongly recommend customers to ensure access to your management interface is configured correctly in accordance with our recommended best practice deployment guidelines,” Palo Alto added in its advisory .\nThis comes only days after the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added another vulnerability affecting a Palo Alto product – this time Palo Alto Expedition (CVE-2024-5910) – to its Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog.\nFortinet, another firewall provider, has also experienced the disclosure of several zero-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the past month.\nPhoto credit: Michael Vi/Tada Images/Shutterstock",

    "text": "EL NUEVO DIARIO, WASHINGTON. – El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, afirmó este viernes que la creación de un Estado palestino es viable incluso con el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, en el poder.\nAl ser preguntado si la creación de dos Estados para resolver el conflicto palestino-israelí era «imposible» mientras Netanyahu estuviera en el cargo, Biden respondió: «No, no lo es».\nAdemás, dijo que Netanyahu no rechaza todas las soluciones de dos Estados y consideró que existen varios tipos de Estados posibles, citando por ejemplo países que son miembros de las Naciones Unidas y no cuentan con Fuerzas Armadas.\n«Hay varios tipos de soluciones de dos Estados (…) Así que creo que hay formas en la que esto podría funcionar», aseveró.\nEl mandatario estadounidense conversó por teléfono este viernes con Netanyahu, un día después de que este último expresara su oposición a la creación de un Estado palestino como parte de un eventual escenario posconflicto en Gaza\nBiden fue preguntado por los periodistas sobre si estaría abierto a limitar la ayuda militar que EE.UU. envía a Israel por los comentarios que hizo Netanyahu, ante lo que el presidente respondió: «Creo que podremos llegar a un acuerdo»\nLa de este viernes fue la primera conversación telefónica entre ambos líderes en casi un mes. Su última llamada fue el 23 de diciembre.\nLa Casa Blanca ha asegurado que la llamada no se produjo por los comentarios que hizo Netanyahu acerca de la creación de un Estado palestino, aunque ha dejado claro que Biden sigue creyendo que el establecimiento de dos Estados es la única solución al conflicto.\nAparte de oponerse a la creación de un Estado palestino, Netanyahu se niega a que la Autoridad Nacional Palestina (ANP), que gobierna algunas partes de la Cisjordania ocupada, retome el control de la Franja de Gaza cuando acabe la ofensiva israelí.\nTanto Biden como la Unión Europea (UE) han reiterado en numerosas ocasiones su respaldo a la solución de dos Estados desde el inicio de la guerra en Gaza y, además, han abogado por que la ANP asuma el control de la Franja cuando acabe el conflicto, después de que fuera expulsada del enclave cuando Hamás le arrebató el poder por la fuerza en 2007.\nIsrael y Hamás llevan en guerra desde el 7 de octubre, cuando un ataque del grupo islamista se saldó con 1.200 muertos y más de 240 rehenes. Tras ello, el Ejército israelí lanzó una fuerte ofensiva sobre Gaza que ha dejado 25.000 fallecidos, muchos de ellos mujeres y niños.",

    "text": "iLMeteo.it,Luglio 2024 è stato il più caldo della storia di Roma '27 notti tropicali su 31 e media massima di 34,8 gradi' ROMA, 02 AGO - Luglio 2024 è stato il più caldo della storia di Roma. È quanto afferma nella nota giornaliera Antonio Sanò, fondatore del sito www.iLMeteo.it sottolineando che \"sono state registrate 27 notti tropicali (minime superiori a 20°C) su 31 con minime medie di 22°C circa. Non solo: \"In alcuni giorni - riferisce Sanò - le temperature non sono mai scese sotto i 25-26°C di notte\". Per quanto riguarda la massima di luglio 2024, nella Capitale il valore medio è stato di 34,8°C. Dopo un inizio luglio leggermente più fresco, in cui il termometro che si è attestato sui 31-33°C, \"i picchi di 37-40°C sono stati prevalenti - continua\". In media sono stati registrati almeno 3 gradi in più rispetto al trentennio di riferimento 1991-2020. Non andrà meglio durante questo primo weekend di agosto: al momento le previsioni indicano che sulla capitale la colonnina di mercurio raggiungerà i 35°C. (ANSA).",

    "text": "2 hours ago\nNest thermostat at 2nd home worked perfectly through the app for the last 3 years. After Nest app update on 12/8/2024, the thermostat is showing offline in the app. We have called customer support twice. We have removed the thermostat from the app and re-added it twice. We have had the wifi company out twice to check the router and all equipment and it is all working fine. All other devices working fine. Ever since the update we can not control the thermostat through the app. Obviously this is related to the update. Someone please provide me with a solution..... we need to be able to control this thermostat that is hundreds of miles away from where we live! per Google, problems with connectivity have occurred after the update. When will the \"fix\" be applied so I can get this thermostat back online?\nan hour ago\nSame problem here. I don’t know if my thermostat works. In the app it shows offline but I’m hoping it will still work. Please inform?",
