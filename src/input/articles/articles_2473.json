    "text": "En images Des aurores boréales ont été aperçues en Haute-Loire et dans la Loire Dans la nuit de jeudi à vendredi, le ciel a offert un beau spectacle aux observateurs du ciel. Teintées de rose et violet, des aurores boréales ont illuminé le ciel. Dans la nuit de jeudi à vendredi, certains observateurs ont eu la chance de contempler des aurores boréales dans le ciel de la Haute-Loire et de la Loire. Ce phénomène est dû à une importante éruption solaire. Teinté de rose et de violet, le ciel a offert un joli spectacle visible à l'œil nu. Certains de nos lecteurs nous ont partagé leur cliché de ce rare phénomène. À La Chapelle-d'Aurec D'autres internautes ont partagé leurs photos sur les réseaux sociaux. A Saint-Jeures Les aurores boréales étaient également visibles dans la Loire, à Saint-Étienne, Saint-Just-Saint-Rambert ou encore dans le Pilat.

Laurent Asselin, médiateur scientifique au planétarium de Saint-Étienne, expliquait alors : «Les aurores boréales résultent de la conjonction de deux phénomènes : d’une part le soleil qui connaît un pic d’activité, avec des éruptions qui envoient des particules dans l’espace. Et d’autre part le champ magnétique de la Terre, qui dévie ces particules vers les pôles. Habituellement, on observe ce pic d’activité du soleil tous les onze ans. Là, le phénomène intervient avec un peu d’avance puisqu’on l’attendait en 2025",

From a young age, Mr. Chen has had a passion for painting. He began his artistic career in 1998 and studied Chinese landscape painting under the guidance of the renowned Chinese painting masters Zhang Weizong, a disciple of Zhu Yizhan, Wu Hufan, and Zhang Daqian, and Cai Guozhong, a disciple of Zhang Daqian.\nInspired by bamboo slips from the Han Dynasty and bamboo curtain paintings from the Qing Dynasty in 2015, Mr. Chen persisted in creating bamboo curtain paintings.

Mr. Jin highly praises Chen Guixu's painting art as follows: \"Mr. Chen Guixu's works are majestic, with profound brushstrokes and far-reaching artistic conception. They appear to be traditional Chinese paintings, but many new ideas from the painter can still be discerned. The artistic conception is vivid, which is an important criterion among the six principles of painting standards proposed by the literary critic Xie He in the Jin Dynasty and has always been the primary criterion for literati to measure painting art. In his paintings, we feel a kind of inexhaustible momentum rushing towards us. Guixu's paintings absorb the overhead composition of 'Jiangshan Ruoci Duo Jiao' by Fu Baoshi and Guan Shanyue, depicting the love for the motherland's landscapes to the fullest extent, and fully utilizing the perspective function of traditional Chinese painting's scattered points. The large green blocks absorb the decorative color blocks of 'Qianli Jiangshan Tu' by the great Northern Song painter Wang Ximeng, portraying the magnificent momentum of today's landscapes in layers. What's more exciting is that Mr. Chen Guixu has innovatively created bamboo painting and calligraphy art. He skillfully writes and draws on bamboo pieces, integrating the artistic beauty of painting and calligraphy with the natural beauty of bamboo textures, achieving excellent artistic effects, which is truly worth celebrating.\"\nThis year, Chen Guixu showcased the following masterpiece at the \"ArtExpo New York”:\nTitle: Thousands of Mountains\nArtist: Chen Guixu\nSize: 32”x88”\nMaterial: Bamboo and watercolor\nTo promote the profound and extensive cultural and artistic heritage of China and to commend outstanding contributions made by Chinese and Chinese-American individuals in recent years in the fields of painting, sculpture, art curation, media promotion, art appreciation, and collection, the \"Sino-American Cultural and Art Association,\" \"American Asian Arts Inc.,\" \"Shanghai Chinese Calligraphy Institute,\" \"Shanghai Cultural and Artwork Appraisal Promotion Association,\" \"Global Dragon TV,\" \"American East-West Art and Culture Association,\" \"YANBO HUANG ART Studio,\" and \"Beijing Guoyunlou Academy\" jointly hosted the \"2024 ArtExpo New York Exhibition Awards Ceremony and Press Conference.\"\n(2024 ArtExpo New York Exhibition Awards Ceremony and Press Conference)\nThe \"2024 ArtExpo New York Exhibition Awards Ceremony and Press Conference\" was jointly hosted by the internationally known bilingual television host, author, and television producer, Ms. Rose Hong from Global Dragon TV, and the senior international art exhibitor, Mr. James Tao.\nMr. Wang Jiangang, Vice Chairman of the United Nations Journalists Association, delivered the opening speech.

Il n'a pas fait de blessés pour le moment, ont indiqué les autorités.\nVue aérienne de l'incendie à Lima, le 4 mars 2025. — © CONNIE FRANCE / AFP Le feu s'est déclaré lundi soir dans un entrepôt de jouets et de produits alimentaires, avant de se propager à d'autres bâtiments commerciaux, a indiqué à la chaîne télévisée N un responsable des pompiers. «L'incendie pourrait se poursuivre jusqu'à dimanche», a-t-il estimé.\nPlusieurs habitants ont été contraints de quitter leur logement, certains emportant leur matelas, leur frigidaire ou des chaises. Une épaisse fumée noire était visible à plusieurs kilomètres du sinistre.\nDes bâtiments pas aux normes «Nous sommes dans le centre historique de Lima, où il y a beaucoup d'entrepôts. C'est une véritable bombe à retardement pour les habitations», a témoigné auprès de l'AFPTV Zulli Cabanillas, un habitant du quartier qui a dû quitter son logement.\nMario Casaretto, en charge de la gestion du sinistre pour la municipalité, a fait état de «onze familles sinistrées».\nLes pompiers tentent d'éteindre l'incendie qui ravage un magasin de jouets dans le centre de Lima, le 4 mars. Plusieurs réservoirs d'eau alimentés par des camions-citernes ont été déployés dans la zone sinistrée. — © CONNIE FRANCE / AFP Le responsable des pompiers a affirmé que les bâtiments touchés ne respectaient «aucune norme». Outre l'absence d'escalier de secours, ils ne disposent pas de système anti-incendie, a-t-il souligné. Parmi les rares bouches d'incendie certaines sont «hors d'usage», a-t-il déploré.",

    "text": "Josh Taylor was laid to rest on December 20 He revealed to his father he wanted to propose to his girlfriend READ MORE: Critical unanswered questions about Josh Taylor's death\nA young man who was buried alive under 1.5m of sand on a popular Queensland island had plans to propose to his long-term girlfriend before his tragic death.\nJosh Taylor’s life support machine was switched off six days after he fell in a deep pit that was dug in the sand at Bribie Island’s Woorim Beach on December 2.\nThe day before the horrific accident, a friend said that Josh told his father, Peter, that he was going to ask his girlfriend, Kaitlynd Odri, to marry him in the new year.\nThe family friend described how Mr Taylor shared details of his cherished final moments with his eldest son during his funeral service held on December 20 at Centennial Memorial Gardens in Brisbane’s south-western suburbs.\n‘The weather was perfect, they fished, they swam and they had a body-surfing competition,’ the friend said.\nJosh Taylor had planned on popping the question to his girlfriend Kaitlynd Odri. Both pictured\nJosh Taylor (above) died six days after he was buried alive under 1.5m of sand on Bribie Island\n‘That night they had dinner around the campfire and that’s when Josh told his dad that he wanted to marry Kaitlynd in the new year.’\nThe couple, who weren’t living together, are understood to have been dating for four years after meeting on the dating app Bumble.\nHundreds of mourners are said to have gathered to farewell the Mr Taylor, an arborist from Brisbane,.\nMourners were asked to wear board shorts, sun dresses and thongs for the occasion to reflect his relaxed, happy-go-lucky attitude to life.\nTragedy struck when Mr Taylor and the group he was with were said to have dug the 1.5m-deep pit to roast a pig under the sand – in the style of a Maori hāngī.\nThere has been an alternative theory floated that the group may have been hunting the island’s wild boars and dug a sand trap to try to catch one.\nDetectives have now launched a criminal investigation into Mr Taylor’s death.\nMore than a dozen men, including paramedics and Mr Taylor’s friends, worked to get him out of the hole\nJosh Taylor’s family farewelled him at a memorial in Brisbane on December 20. Josh is pictured centre\nMr Taylor was said to have fallen into the hole when he stumbled and overbalanced as he got out of a chair, with his flailing arms bringing down its walls on top of him.\nHe was buried headfirst, with his ankles only barely visible to rescuers, who tried to pull him out after their attempts to dig him out failed.\nBut the weight of the sand and the suction created as they yanked at him meant even the brute force of 15 men pulling on a rope around his feet was unable to dislodge him.\nAn off-duty paramedic advised the rescue party to try pulling in a different direction which eventually managed to free him.\nBut one rescuer, passer-by Nathan, said Mr Taylor’s body ‘broke’ as he was released.\n‘All of his family were screaming at us, telling us to help, telling us to get rope so we could pull him out. It was pretty gruesome,’ Nathan said.\n‘There were like 15 men on the rope pulling and he did not budge. It was pretty gnarly when he popped out. I threw up.\n‘He broke. The suction, the force of everyone pulling.’\nMr Taylor did not have a pulse when he was freed but rangers, friends and family performed CPR for 45 minutes until he was flown to Brisbane’s Princess Alexandra Hospital where he died six days later.\nA GoFundMe by family friend Georgia Hoffman for Josh’s parents raised more than $70,000 before it was brought to a conclusion.",
