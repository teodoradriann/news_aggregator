    "text": "Fury has erupted after a North Carolina pastor giving a sermon said that he would clear any rapist whose victim was wearing shorts because 'a man's a man'.\nPastor Bobby Leonard was forced to apologize for his despicable comments, posting a message on the billboard outside the Bible Baptist Tabernacle church in Monroe saying: 'I was wrong'.\nBut it was too late. The clip quickly went viral, and people called for him to resign.\nChristian journalist, Julie Roys, wrote: 'Yes, a man is a man, not an animal. And he is responsible for controlling himself. This pastor needs to resign.'\nIn the full video, Pastor Leonard can be seen addressing the congregation, holding his hands out as he says 'if you dress like that and you get raped, and I'm on the jury, he's gone go free' because 'a man's a man'.\nHe said: 'You find more women going to those places with shorts, than you will women with pants and dresses put together.\n'Try it, if you got time, try it. Have your boy go ahead and try it and watch for it, have your girl go out and watch for it.\n'I used to say this, I haven't said this in a long time, you ready: I say if you dress like that and you get raped, and I'm on the jury, he's gone go free, you don't like it do you, I'm right though.\n'I'm right, because a man's a man.'\nFury erupted online with one viewer saying: 'Pull him out of the pulpit. This shouldn't even be a discussion.'\nAnother said: 'That is beyond disgusting. Utterly shameful.'",

    "title": "Visiting Fellows selected for inaugural cohort of the Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Visiting Fellows Program",
    "text": "The Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Visiting Fellows Program is pleased to announce the selection of its inaugural laureates: Dr. Cynthia A. Adinortey (Ghana) and Dr. Antony Otinga Oteng’o (Kenya).\n“We had many excellent applicants from across Sub-Saharan Africa. Ultimately, our Selection Committee selected these two exemplary scholars, and we are most happy with the result,” said Dr. William Cheung, professor and Director of UBC’s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries (IOF), which administers the Program. “These two exemplary scholars will now have the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at UBC, access the vast resources available here, and create insights that will benefit their universities, their countries, and the world.”\nThe Africa-UBC Visiting Fellows Program came about as the brainchild of Drs Rashid Sumaila and Daniel Pauly, co-winners of the 2023 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. These professors, both of African descent, have been working with scholars from that continent for many years and felt there were too few opportunities for talented early-career academics from sub-Saharan African universities and research institutes to participate in mutually beneficial research collaborations and build international networks. This Program was developed with the assistance of the University of Cape Coast.\n“The University of Cape Coast is proud to support the Fellows Program, which strengthens the collaboration between African researchers and global academic communities,” said Professor Denis W. Aheto, Professor of Coastal Ecology and Director of the Centre for Coastal Management, The Africa Centre of Excellence in Coastal Resilience (ACECoR), University of Cape Coast. “It is vital that we continue to foster these partnerships to address the challenges facing Africa’s oceans and fisheries, ensuring sustainable solutions for future generations.”\n“Rashid and I have strived to work on a global basis, with emphasis on the Global South, and build connections with researchers across all continents,” Dr. Pauly, the Sea Around Us principal investigator, said. “Welcoming Drs. Adinortey and Oteng’o in Vancouver, through the Africa-UBC Oceans & Fisheries Fellowship, will strengthen our ongoing collaboration with African scholars and, ultimately, support efforts towards the conservation and sustainable management of the continent’s marine and freshwater resources.”\n“The Program is open to researchers across all academic fields, who are focused on ocean sustainability and making the ocean economy work for the people who call Africa home”, said Dr. Sumaila. The selected fellows are affiliated with a faculty member at UBC for 12 months – 11 months of virtual engagement, with a month-long visit to UBC’s Vancouver campus. The total value of each fellowship is CAD 23,000, which covers Fellow and UBC counterpart research funds, the cost of air ticket, accommodation and subsistence during the Fellows’ UBC visit, etc.\nThe Laureates\nDr. Cynthia Adinortey is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Cape Coast (UCC) in Ghana, whose research focuses on bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance, with particular attention to food safety and the fisheries value chain, using the One Health collaborative, transdisciplinary approach. She led a USAID/UCC project on antibiotic resistance in Ghana’s aquaculture sector and has actively participated in anti-microbial resistance (AMR) awareness efforts as an AMR Insight Ambassador. She was elected an African Academy of Sciences Affiliate in 2022. Since 2017, she has worked with key stakeholders in Ghana’s fisheries sector, providing microbiology expertise on major projects, including research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fish, the Healthier Smoked Fish Certification Scheme under USAID’s Sustainable Fisheries Management Program (SFMP) and the development of the Safe Fish Certification Scheme with Feed the Future Ghana Fisheries Recovery Activity (GFRA).\n“I am very excited and honoured to be chosen as one of the two inaugural Fellows of the Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Fellowship Program, and to work on specific research related to the identification of indicator organisms for disease diagnosis in Ghanaian aquaculture,” said Dr. Adinortey. “This research has the potential to improve aquaculture disease management, enhance productivity, and contribute to the sustainability of the aquaculture industry in Ghana.”\nDr. Antony Otinga Oteng’o is a Young Career Scientist, Lecturer and Coordinator of the post-graduate program at the Department of Biological Sciences & Agriculture, University of Eastern Africa, Baraton, Kenya (UEAB). With a background in molecular biology and marine plant phylogeny, Dr. Oteng’o’s research interest focuses on species identification, evolutionary relationships, and the critical role that phylogenetic studies play in informing conservation strategies.\n“My fellowship project is entitled, Enhancing Marine Ecosystems and Coastal Communities in Majoreni, South Coast Kenya, is a biodiversity conservation initiative,” said Dr. Oteng’o. Mangroves are vital to the health of coastal ecosystems, serving as nurseries for many marine species, protecting shorelines from erosion, and sequestering significant amounts of carbon. However, these critical habitats are under threat from anthropogenic factors such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change. “By assessing the current state of mangrove forests along the Kenyan coast, I hope to identify the key challenges they face and develop strategies for their restoration, management and conservation. The intended outcomes are improved food security, reduced coastal climate impacts, improved carbon credit, and increased biodiversity.”\nDr. Oteng’o adds that “the project will also explore apiculture (or beekeeping) as a sustainable alternative livelihood for the Majoreni community. Apiculture could not only provide a source of income to the local economy, through the production of honey and other bee products but will also support biodiversity by promoting pollination.”\nAppealing to future applicants\n“I am truly grateful to have been selected for this unique opportunity to contribute to addressing one of Africa’s most pressing challenges: ensuring food security through sustainable aquaculture,” said Dr. Adinortey. “I encourage all young African scientists in ocean and fisheries research to watch for the next call for applications and seize the opportunity to explore how the ocean economy can be harnessed to benefit not only Africans but the world as a whole.”\nDr. Oteng’o concurs. “To aspiring applicants, I encourage them to embrace the opportunity to grow, learn and make a difference by applying to the program. I am confident that the Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Visiting Fellows program will provide me with the tools, support, and inspiration needed to achieve my research goals and contribute to the broader scientific community.”\nNow accepting applications\nThe Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Visiting Fellows program has opened applications for its 2025 cohort.\nInformation on the program, its criteria and how to enter can be found at https://oceans.ubc.ca/applytoafricaubcprogram/. The deadline for applications is May 15, 2024.",

Preliminary information indicates no damage or casualties,” Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.\nIt was unclear if he was referring to a single missile or to an attack in general. He wrote in an earlier post that Kharkiv was under missile attack and several explosions had been heard.\nOleh Syniehubov, the Kharkiv regional governor, said on Telegram that Russian S-300 missiles had hit Kharkiv city twice, and that strikes were also recorded in nearby Vovchansk, but so far no casualties had been reported.\nKharkiv and Vovchansk lie close to the border near Belgorod in Russia. Russia has promised to retaliate for recent Ukrainian missile attacks on the city.\n(Reporting by Oleksandr Kozhukhar in Kyiv and Elaine Monaghan in Washington; Editing by Sandra Maler)",

    "text": "The General Association of the German Insurance Industry (GDV) has reported that damage caused by extreme weather events in the country, such as floods and storms in 2023 total €4.9 billion. Jörg Asmussen, General Manager of the GDV, commented: “The insured damage to houses, household goods, businesses and motor vehicles is expected to have increased by 900 million euros to 4.9 billion euros in 2023 compared to the previous year.” Adding: “Unfortunately, they are pretty stable at the high level of the long-term average of 4.9 billion euros.” According to the GDV, property insurance accounted for damages amounting to €3.6 billion : €2.7 billion for damage caused by storms and hail, and €900 million for other natural hazards such as floods as a result of heavy rain. As for motor insurers, 2023 was above average with around 465,000 claims totaling €1.3 billion. Reflecting on the year, there was largely no major damage caused from winter and autumn storms, however, things were very different in the summer. August alone, witnessed severe storms that winded up causing insured damages [that amounted to €1.5 billion,](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/gdv-reports-e1-5bn-of-insured-natural-disaster-losses-in-august/) almost a third of the total damage. At the same time, property insurers were affected by €950 million and motor vehicle insurers by €550 million. GDV noted that the storms “Kay” and “Lambert” had already caused severe damage amounting to €740 million in June. From this figure, €390 million went to property insurance and the remaining €350 million went towards motor insurers. Moreover, it is important to remember, that with natural hazard insurance, property owners can insure themselves against other natural hazards, such as flooding as a result of heavy rain. “Many property owners are unaware of the natural hazards that threaten their homes. They therefore forego this existential security, even though sufficient insurance cover is offered,” added Asmussen. However, GDV warned that this insurance coverage could become more expensive in the future as a result of climate change and a lack of adaptation to climate impacts. “In many places, things are being planned and built as if climate change and its consequences didn’t exist,” said Asmussen. “We therefore need adaptation to climate change to be anchored in building regulations, less surface sealing and building bans in flood areas.”",

    "text": "Un hombre reportado por las autoridades con “hipotermia severa”, fue encontrado escondido en el tren de aterrizaje de un avión que aterrizó en el aeropuerto de Orly, en París, Francia; la aeronave procedía de Argelia. De acuerdo con el personal del aeropuerto que localizó al hombre, indicaron que estaba en condiciones terribles y muy grave, pues durante el vuelo, se alcanzan grandes alturas, por lo que la temperatura puede llegar a temperaturas de -50 grados centígrados. “Hemos encontrado a un joven en la parte del tren de aterrizaje de un vuelo que llegó desde Orán (noroeste de Argelia)”, dijo el personal del aeropuerto de Orly. El joven, de aproximadamente 20 años de edad y cuya identidad no se ha revelado, lo encontraron al rededor de las 9:30 y 10:00 horas (tiempo local), cuando el personal realizaba las “inspecciones técnicas” a la aeronave justo después de haber aterrizado.

La hipotermia es el resultado de las extremas condiciones climáticas a altitudes elevadas, lo cual llevó a una situación crítica para el intruso. Hasta el momento, no se saben los motivos que lo llevaron a arriesgarse de esa manera, pero es muy probable que sea un migrante que intentó salir de su país de manera ilegal. La investigación por parte de las autoridades parisinas se mantiene en curso para determinar cómo el individuo logró acceder al tren de aterrizaje y qué motivaciones lo llevaron a asumir semejante riesgo.

    "text": "Vivir | Salud\nLa técnica del 20-20-20 y otros trucos para evitar la fatiga visual por abusar de las pantallasSecciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nVivir | Salud\nLa técnica del 20-20-20 y otros trucos para evitar la fatiga visual por abusar de las pantallasEscucha la noticia\n3 min.\nPasar tanto tiempo delante de una pantalla –concretamente once horas al día de media– tiene consecuencias a todos los niveles y una de ellas afecta ... directamente a nuestra salud visual en forma de picor, sequedad, enrojecimiento, lagrimeo, visión borrosa e incluso dolor de cabeza. Tranquilidad, no es nada grave, pero sí muy molesto. Se trata del llamado síndrome visual informático, un trastorno causado por el sobreesfuerzo que tienen que hacer nuestros ojos por el «mal uso y abuso» que hacemos de los dispositivos electrónicos.\nLo que suele ocurrir en estos casos es que estamos tan concentrados mirando la pantalla de un ordenador, del móvil o de la tableta que ni siquiera pestañeamos. Y no es una forma de hablar. Es casi literal. «Muchas veces no somos conscientes de los problemas visuales que nos puede acarrear el fijar la mirada en exceso», alertan los oftalmólogos. «Mantener el enfoque en un objeto que se encuentra a una distancia corta supone un esfuerzo adicional que se debe mantener durante un tiempo determinado, por lo que, inconscientemente, la media de parpadeos baja y esto se traduce en sequedad en los ojos y fatiga visual», precisan en la Sociedad Española de Oftalmología.\nLa buena noticia es que la mayoría de estos síntomas son temporales y suelen desaparecer en cuanto rebajamos el tiempo de exposición a las pantallas. El problema es que muchas veces tampoco tenemos una alternativa de la que echar mano porque esos aparatos electrónicos forman parte de nuestro trabajo y es complicado hacer un 'detox' digital. Así que si eres de los que sufre fatiga visual, escozor, visión borrosa, hipersensibilidad a la luz, ojo seco o dolor de cabeza cada vez que pasas mucho tiempo delante de una pantalla, pon en práctica estos consejos para mejorar tu salud visual.\nUna de las técnicas más usadas para tratar los síntomas del síndrome visual informático es la regla 20-20-20, que se puso muy de moda durante la pandemia por la cantidad de horas que nos pasamos encerrados en casa, pegados a una pantalla y sin poder mirar a larga distancia. Esta técnica, creada por el oftalmólogo Jeffrey Anshel, consiste en que cada 20 minutos apartemos la mirada de la pantalla y miremos a un objeto situado a una distancia de 20 pies –algo más de seis metros– durante un periodo de 20 segundos.\nUna medida a la que también se puede recurrir para complementar esta técnica es aprovechar las pausas en el trabajo para hacerse un automasaje. Uno muy sencillo y efectivo consiste en cerrar los ojos, colocar la punta de los dedos un centímetro arriba de las cejas e ir haciendo círculos suaves durante unos segundos. Se puede proseguir el masaje estirando las cejas con las manos de dentro hacia fuera. Otro ejercicio que te puede ayudar a reducir la fatiga visual es hacer la forma del ocho: con la cabeza inmóvil, observa como tu dedo índice dibuja un ocho imaginario en el aire.\nAdemás de la técnica 20-20-20, otra de las recomendaciones de los oftalmólogos es que no nos olvidemos de parpadear. Los seres humanos lo hacemos unas 18 a 25 veces por minuto, pero los estudios demuestran que cuando estamos delante de una pantalla los movimientos se reducen a la mitad. «Y esa disminución produce ojo seco, la patología más habitual por el uso abusivo de dispositivos electrónicos», precisan los especialistas. En estos casos, se recomienda el uso de lágrimas artificiales y no extralimitarse con las lentes de contacto.\nEl síndrome del ojo seco es una de las enfermedades visuales más comunes. De hecho, se calcula que uno de cada tres españoles lo padecen y solo la mitad está diagnosticado. «Esta patología se desencadena cuando no se producen suficientes lágrimas para mantener los ojos húmedos o cuando esas lágrimas no cumplen su función correctamente por su mala calidad, lo que puede ocasionar muchas molestias en el paciente: sensación de arenilla, ardor, visión borrosa, fatiga visual, dolor, sequedad, enrojecimiento, sensibilidad a la luz...», explica Viviana Outeda, responsable del área de Contactología y Servicios de Salud Visual de General Óptica.\nLas causas que originan este síndrome son variadas y a menudo se trata de una combinación de varias. Las más frecuentes son el propio envejecimiento de la persona, alteraciones hormonales, medicamentos (antidepresivos, diuréticos, antihistamínicos...), factores ambientales (aire acondicionado, humedad, calefacción...), uso intensivo de disopositivos electrónicos, enfermedades autoinmunes (síndrome de Sjögren), uso prolongado o inadecuado de lentes de contacto o un mal funcionamiento de las glándulas que producen las lágrimas.\nLos tratamientos para el ojo seco varían precisamente en función de la causa y la gravedad de los síntomas. Y pueden ir desde una simples gotas oculares (las populares lágrimas artificiales) a cambios en el estilo de vida, tapones para el conductos lagrimal o cirugía.\n¿Tienes una suscripción?

    "text": "Civic Orchestra of Tucson is celebrating its 50th year, which is a pretty remarkable milestone for any arts organization but especially amazing for one that relies on volunteers.\nMusic Director Keun Oh , who took over the ensemble in summer 2022, leads 70 musicians, none of whom are paid, in concerts of challenging classical works and traditional pops.\nThe orchestra has been mostly volunteer — the conductor and concertmaster are paid — since George Schwartz put it together in 1975 as a way to play classical music with his friends. He incorporated the group the next year and secured its non-profit designation.\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\nSchwartz was at the podium for Civic Orchestra of Tucson’s first concert on Feb. 22, 1976, a program that included works by Strauss, Offenbach, Schubert and Handel, along with more contemporary works by Aaron Copland and Morton Gould. That mix of challenging works from the core of the repertoire to lighter, more contemporary fare became the template that his successor Herschel Kreloff adopted when he was named music director in 1980, and the two music directors who followed him — Charles Bontrager, who was conductor from 2018-22, and Oh, who begins his fourth season in October.\nKeun will lead the orchestra in two performances — Oct. 18 at Mountain View High School in Marana and Oct. 26 at Catalina Foothills High School — featuring two works from that very first concert: “ Strauss’s Emperor Waltzes and Offenbach’s “La Vie Parisienne” Overture, which this time around will be Antal Dorati’s arrangement of “La Vie Parisienne” and other themes.\nThroughout the season, the orchestra will sprinkle in works it performed in its first season, bringing its history full circle. All performances are free and most including an instrument petting zoo for younger audience members.\nThe season includes the annual holiday pops concert Dec. 13-14, which will feature Philip Rhodes’ Suite for Bluegrass Quartet and Orchestra; an inclusive and child-friendly concert as part of its winter concert March 7-8, which will included University of Arizona dancers’ and the season finale pops concert and performances by the orchestra’s Young Artists’ Competition winners April 25-6 and May 3.\nFor detail, visit cotmusic.org and follow the orchestra’s social media at @ civicorchestraoftucson .\nContact reporter Cathalena E.
