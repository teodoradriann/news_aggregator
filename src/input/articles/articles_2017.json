    "text": "By Nolan Higdon and Mickey Huff\n[Note:This piece was written two days after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump when Joe Biden was the presumptive nominee. While now outdated, it still illustrates the need for media literacy education.]\n“He will never stop fighting to save America, no matter what the radical left throws at him,”\n exclaimed Donald Trump Jr. just after hearing his father had been struck by a bullet while speaking at a rally with supporters in the rust belt town of Butler, Pennsylvania. The July 13, 2024 shooting left two people dead, one of them the suspected shooter, and injured three others, including former President Donald Trump. Trump Jr.’s comment was undermined by reporting that revealed the 20-year old suspected shooter’s political proclivities were complicated: he was a registered Republican who donated to a Democratic Party organization in 2021. Nonetheless, Trump Jr.’s rush to blame his political opponents, when little to no evidence existed, is indicative of America’s deeply polarized, media illiterate political culture.\nIn fact, the U.S. is a highly media illiterate culture. Numerous studies show that\n massive portions of Americans – regardless of ag e – struggle to determine the veracity of media content. Someone is considered media literate when they have “the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of communication.” While many other countries began offering media literacy courses in the late 20th century, the U.S. did not. As a result, too few Americans have the media literacy skills to navigate the nation’s increasingly and deeply polarized political environment.\nAn April 2024 poll found that a significant number of Americans,\n 20 percent, believe that violence may be needed to get the country on the right track. By May, another poll found that nearly half of Americans think it is likely they will see a civil war in their lifetime. Indeed, in the weeks leading up to the shooting, many liberals were warning about the divisive rhetoric from individuals such as Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation (the right wing think tank behind the controversial Project 2025 manifesto), who recently commented on Steve Bannon’s War Room, “we are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.”\nIn addition,\n scholars and journalists have noted that the news media’s preference for framing most stories as Republican versus Democrat has exacerbated deep polarization in the U.S. This polarized approach to reporting is particularly problematic for breaking news stories such as the July 13 shooting because the fog around unfolding events often produces false stories such as the claim Muslims were celebrating in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, or that there were two shooters in the 2012 Sandy Hook murders. In addition to spreading falsehoods, decades of polarized reporting has been linked to numerous high-profile acts of political violence. In response, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a warning in 2023 that the U.S. was at “high risk” for a violent political attack from “lone offenders or small group attacks that occur with little warning.”\nRather than learn from previous errors and slow down their reporting process, which media literacy educators teach people to do, most corporate media outlets charged forward, claiming that this was clearly a politically motivated shooting, while musing how and why the Secret Service botched Trump’s security. At the same time, many\n high– profile politicians and pun dits asked for the nation to unite and temper divisive language and destructive communication.\nHowever, rather than heed the calls for unity, across the\n political spectrum many Americans demonstrated their weak media literacy skills and began constructing poorly supported and baseless claims. Just as Trump Jr. had done for conservatives, many left leaning social media users concluded, without providing substantive evidence, that the attack was a false flag– meaning that it was carried out by Trump and his supporters to boost support for his presidential run. Others in the https://www.semafor.com/article/07/14/2024/top-democrat-pushed-reporters-to-consider-staged-shooting floated that the shooting was staged with the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, many Republicans blamed President Biden for the shooting, pointing to reports that Biden told donors: “it’s time to put Trump in a bullseye.” Others blamed the right for political violence such as Sharon Zhang, who wrote in Truthout that “In reality, the right has been working to normalize violence of many kinds for years, with Republicans downplaying or even attempting to justify acts of violence committed against their opposition.” Democracy necessitates that people have disagreements, but that those disagreements need to be rooted in facts. The knee-jerk responses to the shooting, which saw people across the ideological spectrum create self-serving narratives based on little to no evidence, illustrate the need for media literacy education in the U.S. While America struggles with a dearth of media literacy skills, new complications are developing, such as AI or deepfakes, which can allow individuals to doctor and change the audio/visual evidence of critical events, like the recent shooting.\nWe have our work cut out for us. If the U.S. hopes to maintain its form of open government, the public needs to be media literate, and they need a truly independent media system that cuts through the polarized rhetoric and exposes how our public and private institutions undermine the democratic process, regardless of partisanship.\nNolan Higdon is a founding member of the Critical Media Literacy Conference of the Americas,\n Project Censored National Judge, author, and lecturer at Merrill College and the Education Department at University of California, Santa Cruz.

    "title": "Pour Tim Burton, « Beetlejuice » 3 n’aura très (malheureusement) jamais lieu",
    "text": "CINÉMA - « Jamais deux sans trois » n’est pas une vérité absolue. Alors que les fans de Tim Burton attendent depuis 36 ans la sortie de la [suite du film culte Beetlejuice](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/culture/video/beetlejuice-2-de-tim-burton-devoile-sa-premiere-bande-annonce-avec-michael-keaton-et-jenna-ortega_231605.html), ils devront très certainement se contenter du second volet avec [Jenna Ortega](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/culture/article/jenna-ortega-revele-avoir-passe-le-casting-de-dune-de-denis-villeneuve-pour-un-role-principal_238836.html) en tête d’affiche qui sorte en cette rentrée. Le réalisateur, qui vient d’ouvrir la Mostra [de Venise](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/culture/video/a-la-mostra-de-venise-2024-sigourney-weaver-n-en-peut-plus-de-cette-question-sur-ses-roles-de-femme-forte_238888.html), a révélé qu’il n’était absolument pas question d’offrir au monstre incarné par Michael Keaton un troisième épisode. Si Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice sort dans les salles obscures le 11 septembre, toute l’équipe était présente à l’ouverture de la 81e Mostra de Venise avant de s’envoler peu après pour l’avant-première mondiale qui a eu lieu à Londres. Et lors d’une interview avec le Hollywood Reporter, Tim Burton est revenu sur la genèse de ce projet, tout en se projetant sur la suite. « Sincèrement, on a mis 36 ans à faire celui-là, dans 36 ans, j’aurai environ 100 ans, donc ça me semble plus que compromis. » Le bon moment pour sortir cette suite Une réponse qui a de quoi décevoir les fans de Tim Burton, mais également les surprendre. En effet, le personnage du démon au costume rayé Beetlejuice introduit dans le film de 1988 a une spécificité : il apparaît lorsque son nom est prononcé trois fois. Le second volet étant intitulé Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, on aurait légitimement pu imaginer un troisième film intitulé Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Lors de cet échange avec THR, Tim Burton est également revenu sur la raison pour laquelle c’était selon lui le bon moment de faire - enfin - une suite. « En vieillissant, c’est là qu’on repense aux premières années de notre vie, qu’on réfléchit. Lydia était une ado très cool. J’avais envie de voir où elle en était adulte, ses relations, ses éventuels enfants, son évolution. Donc ça avait du sens de faire ce film maintenant plutôt qu’en 1989 par exemple. » Dans Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, les spectateurs retrouveront donc le personnage de Lydia. Devenue maman, obligée de revenir au manoir après la mort de son père, elle va une fois de plus devoir faire face aux frasques d’un Beetlejuice qui n’a rien perdu de sa gouaille ni de sa perfidie. Au casting des anciens, il y aura Winona Ryder, Catherine O’Hara et Michael Keaton. S’y ajoutent Jenna Ortega, Willem Dafoe, Justin Theroux ou encore Monica Bellucci.

    "text": "New Delhi: The Delhi High Court Friday refused to permit prayers at the recently demolished ‘Akhoondji mosque’ and the nearby graveyard in Mehrauli on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat.\nMuslims seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins and those of their ancestors on Shab-e-Barat (the night of atonement).\nJustice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav, while dealing with an application by the Managing Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board, noted that the court has directed status quo on the site which is now in the possession of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).\nThe application forms part of a petition by the committee on the issue of demolition.\nJustice Kaurav observed that the main petition, which was heard by the court on several occasions, is already listed for final disposal March 7.\n“At this stage, the court is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is dismissed,” ordered the court.\nThe ‘Akhoondji mosque’, believed to be over 600 years old, as well as the Behrul Uloom madrasa there were declared as illegal structures in Sanjay Van and demolished by the DDA January 30.\nThe counsel for the petitioner said worshippers, whose families are buried in the nearby graveyard, should be allowed offer prayers there on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat later this month.\nHe said the mosque was several centuries old and prayers were being offered there for the last many years. There was also an “active graveyard” which was used by the locals, the advocate told the court.\nFebruary 5, the high court had asked the DDA to maintain status quo on the site where the mosque once stood.\nThe petitioner committee has argued that the demolition of the mosque was illegal.\nThe DDA has defended its action before the high court on the ground that the demolition took place pursuant to the January 4 recommendation of its Religious Committee. The decision, it said, was taken after the Religious Committee afforded an opportunity of hearing to the CEO of Delhi Waqf Board. The petitioner has, however, contended that the Religious Committee has no jurisdiction to order any demolition action.\nJanuary 31, the court asked the DDA to file its reply clearly setting out the action that has been taken in respect of the property concerned as well as its basis.\nIt also asked the development authority to state whether any prior notice was given before the demolition.\nPTI\n ",

    "text": "By Kelsey Weekman, Yahoo News December 28, 2023 at 12:38 pm EST By Kelsey Weekman, Yahoo News December 28, 2023 at 12:38 pm EST TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) users have been clamoring for the release of 32-year-old Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who served seven years in prison for her role in the 2016 killing of her mother before her release on Dec. 28 . Posts calling her \"queen\" and \"mother\" appeared on social media, where fans are treating her with an enthusiasm usually reserved for pop stars.\nAccording to a post from her stepsister Mia Blanchard, family members maintained social media accounts for Gypsy while she was behind bars, including a TikTok account with nearly 500,000 followers. People are eager to see how she will acclimate to freedom, and whether she'll become a social media star herself.\nWho is Gypsy Rose Blanchard and what did she do?\nGypsy is believed to have been a victim of child abuse through Munchausen syndrome by proxy , a psychological disorder in which a caretaker makes someone ill (or creates the illusion that they are ill) to get attention. She said that throughout her childhood, her mother, Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard, took her to doctors to have her treated for conditions — including leukemia and muscular dystrophy — that she never actually had. She said she was forced to use a wheelchair and oxygen tank, even though she required neither.\nDoctors expressed concern about Gypsy's treatment beginning in 2007 , but she remained in Dee Dee's care. She unsuccessfully attempted escape in 2011, and after meeting then-boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn online in 2012 and speaking with him for a few years, she planned to escape with him.\nGodejohn stabbed Dee Dee to death in 2016. Her body was discovered thanks to a Facebook post announcing the attack, which remains online to this day. Gypsy was sentenced in 2016 to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to her role in the attack, and Godejohn received a life sentence in 2018 for first-degree murder.\nThe 2017 HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest helped publicize Gypsy's case. In 2019, Joey King and Patricia Arquette portrayed Gypsy and Dee Dee for the popular Hulu limited series The Act , which was nominated for two Emmy Awards .\nThese moments in pop culture, combined with coverage in countless articles , true-crime podcasts , YouTube videos and TikTok explainers that have garnered millions of views have ensured that Gypsy's story is well-known and discussed often. Throughout her prison sentence, she has given multiple interviews expressing her remorse and desire to move past what she's done. She wrote a book called \"Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom\" that will be published in January.\nWhy does Gypsy Rose Blanchard have so many fans? Because Gypsy's case is so frequently discussed, she's become a bona fide pop culture figure. Even Pop Crave , the X account dedicated to disseminating information about celebrities, has been posting updates about Gypsy's release, soliciting responses like \"mother\" (a slang term used to describe a beloved famous woman ) and \"reputation era incoming\" (a reference to Taylor Swift's vengeance-inspired album ).\nPeople looking forward to her release have been posting fan edits, or videos of Gypsy set to music, as they would for someone like Nicki Minaj or a K-Pop idol . Some users jokingly posted plans for a \"release party\" and discussed what cultural moments they hope she'll experience as a free woman.\n\"She served so hard … can't wait for her to strut down the streets on Dec 28,\" one user captioned a video of Gypsy testifying in court. \"Literally on my way to Gypse (sic) Rose prison so she has a ride home,\" another wrote .\nGypsy's stans may have seen the mass reconsideration of pop culture icons who once drew misogynistic ire from tabloids, like Britney Spears and Pamela Anderson, and chosen to get ahead of the curve by throwing their support behind her. It's also possible that those fans have been affected by the recent true-crime reckoning , which questioned how brutal tragedy has become entertainment at the expense of victims but sympathized with Gypsy's violent response to years of abuse. Maybe Gypsy is drawing ironic support from the same people who support convicted fraudsters like Anna Delvey and Elizabeth Holmes.\nEach fan may have a different reason for supporting Gypsy, but there are still a number of people who are worried about the behavior. Some social media users expressed concern about the level of fandom building for Gypsy before she’s even had time to acclimate to life outside of prison.\n\"When Miss Blanchard gets released, I need y'all to be normal. Please do not give this girl … a heart attack. Remember how long she's been locked behind bars,\" TikToker @zacefronisdead wrote in a post. \"please leave gypsy rose blanchard alone she is a victim of abuse and has been failed by our justice system like shes not yas slay boots c*** shes a real woman who has REAL IRREVERSIBLE life trauma like can we behave that way,\" X user @SwintyMinty posted .\ni tell u now the gen z response to the release of gypsy rose is going to be studied in history books for years to come pic.twitter.com/48kSL5hlUB\n— jade (@itsjustjadaxo) December 26, 2023 Just before her release, Gypsy told People that she regrets what she did to her mother every day. She didn't say anything about her fans or what might be waiting for her on social media — just that she's \"on the eve of happiness.\"\n\"I'm ready for freedom,\" she said. \"I'm ready to expand, and I think that goes for every facet of my life.\"",

    "title": "‘Jewish and Palestinian communities deserve a future free from fear’",
    "text": "As we stand at the threshold of a new year, let us embrace the blank canvas it offers, seizing the opportunity to paint a narrative of resilience, growth and unity.\nIn a time marked by uncertainty and strife, the power of a child’s question can be both heart-wrenching and enlightening. One evening, as I sat with my daughter, her innocent query cut to the core of our concerns: “Daddy, are people going to come to Chicago to kill Jews?”\nHer words underscored the ever-present fears and divisions that linger in Chicago and beyond. But amid the challenges, there is hope, and the American Jewish Committee is uniquely poised to be a catalyst for change.\nAs a dedicated board member of AJC, my involvement with this organization is deeply personal. AJC’s unwavering commitment to promoting acceptance, combating antisemitism and advocating for human rights resonates with me on a profound level. These are not just values; they are a call to action, a path toward building bridges between communities in conflict.\nOpinion\nAJC’s unique position in the pursuit of peace lies in its extensive network, diplomacy and dedication to personal engagement. The organization actively engages with policymakers, diplomats and thought leaders on a global scale, creating platforms for dialogue and cooperation. It is in these connections and shared experiences that AJC finds its strength.\nBoth Jewish and Palestinian communities are hurting amid the ongoing war. The pain is real, and so is the urgent need for healing. AJC’s mission is not only about diplomacy; it’s about people. By organizing educational programs and exchange initiatives, AJC fosters personal connections that serve as critical reminders to us of the shared humanity that transcends borders and political differences.\nIt is crucial, particularly in these trying times, for communities to come together. Both Jewish and Palestinian communities deserve a future free from fear, and we can all play a role in achieving this. As an AJC board member, I have seen firsthand the organization’s dedication to fighting antisemitism and advocating for human rights on all sides, fostering a more equitable and harmonious future.\nThe need to unite against terrorism is a shared goal. Hamas, recognized as a terrorist organization by numerous countries, including the U.S., poses a threat to the security and peace of all. It is imperative we come together, transcending political boundaries, to combat terrorism and promote a more secure future for everyone.\nSteps to promote peace\nFor those in Chicago and beyond, there are concrete steps we can take to bridge divides and promote peace:\n- Educate yourself: Take the time to learn from trusted, balanced sources about the conflict, its history and the perspectives of all parties involved. Knowledge is a powerful tool for understanding and empathy.\n- Support peace initiatives: Advocate for organizations like AJC, which work tirelessly to promote peace, understanding and cooperation between communities.\n- Engage in dialogue: Open conversations with individuals from different backgrounds. Building bridges begins with a willingness to listen and understand.\n- Foster inter-community relationships: Support cultural exchange programs and initiatives that bring Jewish and Palestinian communities together for mutual understanding.\n- Promote acceptance: Encourage acceptance and respect in your community. Speak out against hate and discrimination wherever you encounter it.\nIn these uncertain times, AJC’s unique ability to facilitate understanding is a beacon of hope. As we join hands, recognize our shared humanity and stand together against terrorism, we can work toward a world where fears like my daughter’s become a relic of the past. Building peace is a collective effort, and AJC is leading the way. Join me.\nLaurence Bolotin has worked in higher education administration and the Jewish community for 20 years.

    "text": "What Luther and Calvin are for evangelical Christians globally, Kwame Bediako is for many African evangelicals. From his dramatic conversion in 1970 to his death in 2008, Bediako was the primary architect of and inspiration for theological work that grappled with the realities of African culture. On this 20th anniversary of the publication (by Orbis Books) of some of Bediako’s most influential essays in [Jesus and the Gospel in Africa: History and Experience](https://orbisbooks.com/products/jesus-and-the-gospel-in-africa), his memory still reverberates across the continent, as indicated by the seven reflections collected below on his ongoing influence. Born and raised in Ghana, Bediako was a professing atheist studying existentialist literature as a doctoral student in Bordeaux, France, when an awareness of Christ as the truth powerfully overwhelmed him while he was showering. He finished his degree in French literature but turned his powerful mind to the Bible and theology, later completing a second doctorate in Aberdeen, Scotland, under missiologist Andrew Walls, who [called Bediako “the outstanding African theologian of his generation.”](https://dacb.org/stories/ghana/bediako-kwame/) Bediako attended the First International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974, meeting other prominent Majority World evangelicals including René Padilla, Samuel Escobar, and Vinay Samuel. At that time, he conceived the idea of a research center on the relation between the gospel and African culture. With support from his denomination, the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, that vision was realized as the Akrofi-Christaller Institute of Theology, Mission and Culture (ACI) in 1987. While self-consciously evangelical, Bediako sought connections between the gospel and African traditional religion. He argued that the gospel’s success in Africa “shows clearly that the form of religion once held to be farthest removed from the Christian faith [i.e., African animism] had a closer relationship with it than any other.” Bediako contended that Jesus Christ speaks to us in terms of our “human heritage.” In one of his essays, he argued eloquently from the New Testament, especially the Book of Hebrews, that Christ was our “elder brother” fulfilling the mediatorial function that African traditional religion ascribed to ancestors. While rejecting claims of radical continuity between African religion and Christianity, Bediako also differed from the emphasis on radical discontinuity associated with Nigerian [Byang Kato](https://africa.thegospelcoalition.org/article/can-we-be-christian-african-the-legacy-of-byang-kato/), first general secretary of the Association of Evangelicals in Africa. That tension between Bediako’s and Kato’s views on the interaction between the Christian faith and African culture persists today and appears in two of the reflections presented below. Ebenezer Yaw Blasu, research fellow, Akrofi-Christaller Institute, Akropong, Ghana I first met Kwame Bediako in 1988, when I was a Presbyterian student pastor. He was busy sorting books in what is now ACI’s Zimmerman Library. In our brief conversation, he exhorted me to ensure “Africanness” in my ministry. I listened, but without enthusiasm. At the time, my main theological inspirations were Karl Barth and John Macquarrie, who did not say anything about indigeneity in doing theology. In 1990, I was invited to speak at an evangelistic outreach in Ottawa, Canada, on the role of Christianity in transforming indigenous cultures. Suddenly, Bediako’s earlier exhortation resonated in my mind. As if by divine intervention, I ran into him in Accra on my way to the airport. He excitedly handed me a new book he had published, Jesus in African Culture: A Ghanaian Perspective. Reading this book while in flight highly informed my message and contributed significantly to its success. For the first time, I spoke as an African evangelist outside Africa, to the glory of God. Bediako believed that the theological education curriculum in Africa should equip Christian leaders for their task by connecting them with the redeeming, transforming activity of the living God in the African setting. If Africa is now a heartland of Christian faith, he insisted at a 1996 workshop, then “a positive affirmation of African Christianity, and not merely an African reaction against the West,” should be the driving force in curriculum development. Kwame’s work has liberated my mind by establishing the undeniable truth that Christianity is not a “Western religion,” nor are Westerners the final arbiters of Christian theology and faith. Genuine theology needs contextual inputs, including those from indigenous or grassroots experiences. Hence, African Christianity needs to and can produce African theologies that contribute to the theological thinking of world Christianity. Seblewengel Daniel, director, East African Sending Office, SIM, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Kwame Bediako was my PhD supervisor. His lectures were both intellectually stimulating and spiritually nourishing. He was equally committed to the deep rootedness of the Christian faith in the Scriptures and its authentic indigenous expression. Bediako strongly advocated for a continuous engagement between gospel and culture. He asserted that people should engage their pre-Christian heritage with confidence in the power of the Spirit to guide and illuminate them. Conversion, he said, is not abandoning one’s heritage altogether and taking on a foreign identity but turning to Christ with the totality of one’s being. The divine encounter, therefore, will enable one to be an authentic African Christian. Kwame was a charismatic preacher and teacher. The depth of his knowledge about and commitment to the church in Africa was beyond description. Professor Bediako was very warm toward his students and had a delightful sense of humor. He took great interest in our lives and the lives of our family members. He made time to visit students in their homes, and he and his wife, Mary, invited us to their home for meals. I value his unwavering dedication to empowering female theologians. He intentionally pursued affirmative action in his institute by appointing women to higher leadership positions. Aiah Foday-Khabenje, former general secretary, Association of Evangelicals in Africa; country director, Children of the Nations, Freetown Sierra Leone Kwame Bediako’s groundbreaking work Theology and Identity framed theology in terms of self-identity as a foundation and hermeneutical tool for theological reflection. Jesus and the Gospel in Africa is a collection of articles on how Christ could be the answer to the questions Africans ask about issues relevant to their context, in contrast to the questions raised by missionary Christianity from the West. It demonstrates how God can speak to Africans in African idioms and through hearing in African mother tongues what God has done. Bediako’s theological beliefs were inspired by his personal experience and how some church fathers practiced their faith in the context of the Greco-Roman culture. Bediako believed that it was possible for people to connect with Christ through their cultural beliefs, without the gospel having to reach Africa through Western missionaries. One might assume that Bediako’s quest was simply about putting an African face on theology, providing Christian truth with contextually sensitive illustrations and applications. However, these aspirations for African theology were more complex and diverse than contextualization. They also involved an attempt to identify a correlation between Christianity and African culture, or between African traditional religions and the Christian worldview. This aspect of his project has raised doubts about the orthodoxy of his approach. Diane Stinton, associate professor of world Christianity, Regent College, Vancouver, Canada Under Bediako’s supervision of my PhD studies on contemporary African Christologies, I came to appreciate his enduring contributions to theological scholarship. He highlighted Africa’s role in Christian history, recovered the importance of primal religions to the flourishing of African Christianity, insisted on an integral identity for African Christian believers, integrated African Christianity into mainstream studies of Christian history and theology, and emphasized vernacular and informal expressions of theology. After completing my PhD, I helped to launch a master’s degree program in African Christianity at Daystar University in Nairobi, inspired by its equivalent at ACI and graced by Bediako’s inaugural lecture in 2006. A central conviction within Bediako’s scholarship and ministry was the tremendous significance of mother-tongue Scriptures in Africa. Against the denigration of African languages, cultures, and religions by many Western interpreters, Bediako followed his mentor Andrew Walls in seeing African Christianity as a living demonstration that the gospel is “infinitely translatable.” Bediako exemplified what Kenneth Cragg called “integrity of conversion.” He exhibited an all-encompassing faith that gathers up “the broken fragments of our history”—a phrase from a Kenyan Anglican Communion prayer that he loved to quote—and places them before Jesus to be redeemed. Kayle Pelletier, lecturer, South African Theological Seminary, Sandton, South Africa As a seminary student sensing God’s call to theological education in Africa, I took a course on African traditional religion (ATR). There, I encountered Kwame Bediako for the first time. In the early 2000s, Bediako was one of the few African theologians whose work was readily accessible. Now, after 20 years of doing theological education in Zimbabwe and South Africa, I find myself returning to Bediako to better understand why Africa remains such a syncretistic religious environment even though Christianity has been on the continent for more than a century. Responding to derogatory Western estimations of ATR, Bediako rightly placed value on the primal religious conditions that enabled the gospel’s acceptance in Africa. Bediako sought to define an authentic African Christian identity through the African people’s pre-Christian religious experiences and beliefs. However, connecting similar, continuous elements of pre-Christian beliefs with Christian beliefs has only exchanged Western philosophical and cultural influence on Christianity for African influence, contributing to a syncretistic, tradition-accommodating gospel. Scripture, through which we must interpret any pre-religious culture imbued with general revelation, transforms belief and practice into its biblical image, creating an authentic Christian identity for all. Nathan Chiroma, principal, Africa College of Theology, Kigali, Rwanda As a young African theologian (originally from Nigeria), I attended two of Kwame Bediako’s seminars in Ghana. He encouraged me, as a young African theologian, to cultivate in-depth theological contemplation ingrained in my African background. Through his works and life, he gave me the confidence and inventiveness with which to approach theology. One of Bediako’s significant contributions to African theology was the concept that African Christians can practice genuine Christianity within their own cultural expressions, dispelling the myth that Christianity is solely a Western or white man’s religion. He provided me with a model for doing theology in a way that is true to the gospel and the African context, challenged me to traverse the intricacies of religion and culture from a biblical perspective, and prompted me to reassess my preconceptions about African Christianity that had been taught from a Western perspective. Bediako profoundly influenced many African theological institutions, originally established by foreign missionaries, that taught Western concepts out of step with our African context. His writings have been instrumental in transforming schools to better align with our local perspectives. In addition to redefining the bounds of African Christianity, his dedication to contextual theology has promoted a more inclusive and representative theological debate. Casely Essamuah, secretary, Global Christian Forum, and Ghanaian native Before his conversion, Kwame Bediako was an atheist who had arrived at his conclusions intellectually and with such conviction that he couldn’t keep them to himself. After his conversion, he believed that an intellectual life without reference to the living God and the living Christ was futile. Bediako pursued scholarship in a community that had prayer and worship at its center. He saw scholarship as an opportunity for service and enlarged vision, not merely to please the academy but to equip local church leaders—hence, his insistence that ACI should be located in Akropong, the heart of Presbyterianism in Ghana, and not Accra, the political and educational capital of Ghana. Furthermore, the institute also requires that all master’s and doctoral theses must have abstracts in local languages. It is no wonder that the center he initiated continues to thrive and flourish in his absence.
