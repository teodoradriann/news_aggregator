    "title": "How Science And Religion Came Together To Build A 'New Pompeii' | MENAFN.COM",
    "text": "Author: Jessica Hughes ( MENAFN - The Conversation) The history of how a new city of Pompeii was built in the 19th century is little known, but a new exhibit reveals its story.\nThe exhibition , held in the Catholic shrine of the Blessed Virgin of the Rosary of Pompeii , sheds new light on the relationship between science and religion in the late 19th century. The exhibition tells the story of the Meteorological-Geodynamic-Volcanological Observatory that was set up at the shrine in 1890 to monitor the activity of Mount Vesuvius.\nThis Pompeii isn't the famous ancient Greco-Roman city, which was destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius in AD79, but rather the modern city down the road from the excavations. The city centres around the huge Catholic shrine, which was founded in the 1870s by an energetic lawyer called Bartolo Longo, on a plot of land next to the ancient Roman amphitheatre.\nDuring his lifetime, Longo built a“new Pompeii” which attracted pilgrims and visitors from all over Italy and beyond. As well as the magnificent church with its treasured painting of Our Lady of Pompeii , the city was home to several charitable institutions and pioneering urban projects, including an orphanage for girls, a residential home for the sons of prisoners, an industrial-scale printing press – and the observatory.\nThe new exhibition is displayed in a room with high ceilings in the shrine archives. A neat display of antique photographs, documents and original scientific instruments tells the story of this important but little-known episode in the history of science.\nThe painting of our Lady of the Rosary. Publikacja , CC BY The development of the new city all started with a miracle. In 1886, Francesco Denza (a Barnabite priest and eminent astronomer, who was the first director of the Vatican's Observatory ) recovered from paralysis after praying to Our Lady of Pompeii.\nDenza came to Pompeii to give thanks for this healing miracle, and asked what he could do for the shrine in return. Longo proposed setting up an observatory on site, with Denza as director. A tower was constructed above the girls' orphanage, and filled with state-of-the-art modern instruments.\nLongo then organised a grand festival of science to coincide with the observatory's inauguration on the Feast of the Ascension on May 15 1890. Reports of the event suggest 20,000 people attended. They listened to speeches in praise of the observatory and the broader union of the science, faith and charity that it represented. Longo's own speech contrasted the new Christian Pompeii with the ancient Greco-Roman city next door. It pointed to the bloody slaughter that took place in its amphitheatre, where brutal gladiatorial combats and staged animal hunts had been the favourite forms of entertainment in the ancient city.\nThe shrine in 2024. Author provided., CC BY The new observatory's significanceThe new Pompeii observatory monitored the activity of Mount Vesuvius, keeping track of seismic movements and meteorological changes. Its regular data bulletins – which were dispatched to other observatories around Italy, as well as to individual scientists and shrine benefactors – now constitute a valuable record of geological events in this unique volcanic terrain.\nFor instance, the bulletin for September 1 1890 records how:“The lava at the base of the main channel of Vesuvius has formed into a horseshoe shape: on the south-south-eastern side the lava is flowing more abundantly ... The crater is emitting occasional flares and a calm jet of projected materials.”\nLongo saw the observatory as proof of how religion and science could exist in happy union – contrary to the widespread conviction that“science and faith must of necessity be in eternal disagreement” (to cite from his inaugural speech).\nThat is the driving message of the shrine's current exhibition as well. I spoke with the curator, Salvatore Sorrentino (himself both a mathematician and member of the Pompeian clergy). He explained that the observatory itself was born from a scientist's act of faith, that is, Denza's prayers to God, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin.\n(Left) Father Francesco Denza (1834-1894) and (right) Bartolo Longo (1841-1926). Wiki Commons Sorrentino also drew a comparison with the work of the great Pisan scientist Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), who saw his own experimental methods as a means of asking questions of God, and of discovering the footprint of the creator in the physical world.\nThe observatory is a landmark in the history of science, that changed the way that the land around Pompeii was understood at the end of the 19th century. Yet at Pompeii, as elsewhere, there was still room for older religious understandings.\nAn inscription chiselled into the shrine façade commemorates how Pompeii was delivered from the major eruption of April 1906 . The inscription records“for posterity” how the painting of Our Lady was taken out of the church during the eruption, and carried in a procession“in view of the fiery peak”. The surrounding towns“were terrified by the darkness and ruins”, but at Pompeii“the sky became calm, and all souls were reassured”.\nThe news bulletin published by the shrine narrates how, by the end of this violent eruption, the new Pompeii had received only the gentlest sprinkling of ashes.\nLooking for something good?

    "text": "The 1984 film got people to cheer for fatherless outsider Ren McCormack as he fought for the attention of Ariel Moore, the wild daughter of Rev. Shaw Moore. But most of all, it got people to want to join in when Ren gleefully shouted, “Let’s dance!”\nThe Line Mountain Theater Department will present “Footloose the Musical” Thursday, Friday and Saturday, at 7 p.m.\n“Footloose the Musical,” based on the movie, was produced on Broadway in 1998, with lyrics by Dean Pitchford and music by Tom Snow. It follows the same storyline of the rebellious Ren moving to a small middle-American town where dancing is forbidden. Outraged, Ren gathers his classmates together to question Rev. Moore and the town council and demand a real prom with rock-and-roll dancing.\nBeverly Lash, theatre director at Line Mountain, said this year’s musical will honor the school’s 16 graduates, and she hopes to send them off with support from the community.\n“Yes, we are losing 16 students from the pit, crew, and cast. I want the audience to see how much the students have contributed to the program,” she said. “I hope the audience will understand one of the main themes from the show, which is listening to your children, and forgiveness.”\nAddalyn Shingara, a senior, plays the role of Ariel.\n“Ariel is a teenage girl trying to figure out life after dealing with the loss of her brother while her parents attempt to heal from the trauma,” Shingara said. “She is the pastor’s daughter, but even though she’s in the choir on Sunday mornings, she also has a bit of a nixie side.”\nShingara enjoys portraying Ariel’s complicated personality.\n“It’s fun to play her because she’s extremely spunky and always stands up for herself,” she said. “She doesn’t care what other people think of her, and that’s something I admire about her.”\nSenior Levi Ferster plays Ren McCormack, portrayed by Kevin Bacon in the original movie.\n“Ren McCormack is a strong dancer who is very sarcastic. He is a smart boy that is also stubborn and rebellious,” Ferster said. “When he tries to change the town’s law about dancing, he genuinely cares about his classmates, not just for the sake of his own benefit. I enjoy playing Ren the most because of his dance moves and high tenor voice. This has pushed me to extend my vocal range and build my confidence to dance at the degree that he does.”\nKatie Heim, also a senior, plays the role of Rusty, portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker in the film version.\n“As a character, she is funny, a little bit ditsy, very talkative, a loyal best friend to Ariel, and a little lost as she finds herself navigating through her feelings for Willard,” Heim said, referring to Ren’s new best friend, Willard Hewitt.\nHigh school musicals always seem to involve some unexpected moments that the cast and crew will remember for a long time. Heim recalled watching Ryleigh Beer fall off of the stage during a rehearsal, but added reassuringly, “She was okay.”\n“A funny story during the production of “Footloose” was when Cadence and I were practicing roller skating in the school hallway,” Ferster said.\nAnother unforgettable moment involved a spontaneous dance that ripped everyone up.\n“One of the funny stories I have about working on ‘Footloose’ was when me and Levi (Ren McCormack) were rehearsing ‘Almost Paradise’ on stage, and Derek (Willard Hewitt) ran on stage dancing to be funny and ripped his pants in front of everyone,” Shingara said.\nLash marveled at the fact that February 17 was the 40th anniversary of the original movie version of “Footloose.” Much like the students in the story, she’s seen her own students grow and support each other.\n“I love to see how the cast reaches out to each other and are inclusive,” she said. “I always tell students to leave their egos at the front door. It doesn’t matter if you have a leading role or a non-speaking role. They are all in this together. Respect is a priority.”\nCindy O. Herman lives in Snyder County. Email comments to her at",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Franklin County, Georgia from 1901-2000 was 42.9. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Franklin County, Georgia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Franklin County, Georgia history.",
