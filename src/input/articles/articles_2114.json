    "title": "AI Scanners Hunt Rental Car Damage - And You're Fighting Back - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Rental car companies have turned vehicle inspections into a high-tech game of “gotcha,” and you’re the target. Major players like Hertz and Sixt are deploying AI-powered scanners that photograph every millimeter of your rental car, flagging everything from genuine scratches to literal dirt as billable damage. But here’s the twist that feels straight out of a Black Mirror episode: consumers are now using their own AI apps to fight algorithmic overcharges with algorithmic evidence. These drive-through portals are already scanning cars at major airport locations. The promise sounds reasonable: faster check-ins, objective assessments, fewer disputes. The reality? Customers are getting hit with charges for: Minor imperfections are becoming major revenue streams for rental companies. “You can’t go after scuffs—that goes against the whole service culture,” warns Eliron Ekstein , CEO of Ravin AI , who previously worked with rental companies before pivoting to consumer protection. “But, if I damage the door… then it’s fair for you to go after me.” Yet that nuance gets lost when AI systems flag every imperfection as revenue potential. Customers report $300 bills for barely-visible marks that human eyes would dismiss. Companies claim human reviewers verify AI findings, but the financial incentive to approve charges makes that review process feel less than thorough. The pattern mirrors every tech platform power grab: Consumer AI apps are creating digital evidence to challenge unfair charges. Enter the resistance: smartphone AI apps that create your own AI-verified documentation. These tools essentially let you create a digital paper trail before and after your rental. Think of it as bringing your own body cam to interactions with algorithmic authority. Multiple rental companies are testing similar scanner technology across the industry. This standoff represents something bigger than rental car drama. When companies automate fairness out of customer service, consumers inevitably automate their own protection. Avis and Enterprise are reportedly testing similar scanner systems, suggesting this technological cold war is just beginning. Your best defense remains surprisingly analog: walk around that rental car with your phone, document everything, and remember that in the age of AI versus AI, the winner is whoever has the better timestamps .",

    "text": "La empresaria francesa Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, nieta del fundador de L'Oréal, se ha convertido en la primera mujer en amasar una fortuna de 100.000 millones de dólares (90.327 millones de euros), según el índice de [multimillonarios](https://www.elprogreso.es/tags/multimillonarios) elaborado por Bloomberg. En concreto, en la sesión del día 28, después de que las acciones de L'Oreal se anotasen una subida del 0,58%, hasta un precio récord de 451,30 euros, la fortuna estimada de la empresaria gala se elevaría a 100.200 millones de dólares (90.507 millones de euros). Bettencourt Meyers, de 70 años, es vicepresidenta de la junta directiva de L'Oréal, empresa fundada en 1909 por su abuelo químico, Eugene Schueller, para producir y vender un tinte para el cabello que él había desarrollado y que se ha transformado en una empresa global, valorada en 241.000 millones de euros. Como hija única, Bettencourt Meyers heredó la mayor parte de la riqueza tras la muerte en 2017 de su madre, Liliane Bettencourt. Hoy en día, la empresaria y su familia son los mayores accionistas de L'Oreal, con casi el 35%. A pesar de la ganancia registrada, la fortuna de Bettencourt Meyers sigue siendo inferior a la de su compatriota francés Bernard Arnault, fundador de LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, que ocupaba el segundo lugar en el ranking mundial de ricos con un patrimonio estimado de 179.400 millones de dólares (162.046 millones de euros).",

One hailstone was an estimated 6.25 inches across, which would make it the second largest ever found in Texas. There only been four verified hailstones over 6 inches since 1950.\nSevere thunderstorms and tornadoes brought havoc to the Midwest and then through the Southeast this week, where at least three people died as a result of weather events.\nAlmost 95,000 energy customers in Alabama were without power as of 7 a.m. ET, according to\nPowerOutage.us, as well as 57,000 in Mississippi and 50,000 in Florida. Georgia and North Carolina each had about 17,000 power outages.\nThe bad weather is over for most but some 7 million people are at risk of severe weather Friday morning, with an “enhanced risk” of intense storms and winds of up to 70 mph for parts of Florida, the National Weather Service office in Jacksonville said.\nNBC News Dallas-Fort Worth spoke to families in Pecan Plantation, southwest of Fort Worth, whose houses were battered by hail the size of golf balls.\nMedic Lydia Torres told the station that the sound of hail landing on her ambulance was like a bomb.\n“It sounded like bombs were hitting the top of the ambulance. Especially when it hit the top of the windshield, you could see the glass start to shatter everywhere,” she said.\nShe said she and her partner were on a call when hail forced them to scramble for shelter. “It looks like a paintball hit him in the back of his shoulder blades,” she said.\nWindows and skylights were smashed across the community, although some children were keen to collect the hailstones as frozen souvenirs.\nMeanwhile in Maury County, Tennessee, which experienced widespread destruction from tornadoes this week, Columbia Fire & Rescue released drone footage showing the extent of the damage and the scale of the cleanup operation to come.\nEntire houses have been laid to waste, while large sections of wooded areas are now without trees.\nCounty officials offered affected residents advice on\nhow to separate and dispose off the debris.\nAs for next week, flash flooding is a big concern along the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, where between 5 and 7 inches of rain is expected.\nThe post\nBaseball-size hail hits Texas as 200,000 across the South remain without power appeared first on NBC News.",

    "text": "[Entrepreneurs](../) Gaston Glock, creator of handgun that flooded the world, dies at 94 The popularity of the Glock semiautomatic made Mr. Glock a billionaire and added his name to the array of weapons known by their makers: [Kalashnikov](//www.washingtonpost.com/world/mikhail-kalashnikov-inventor-of-ak-47-dies-at-94/2013/12/23/624e40be-6bf5-11e3-b405-7e360f7e9fd2_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_5), Beretta, Colt, [Uzi](//www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/09/10/inventor-uzi-gal-dies-at-79/96c6f63a-533f-45da-9a28-0f2650eeaf0e/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) and others. Mr. Glock’s path, however, may have been among the most improbable: a small-business tinkerer who once made door hinges and curtain rods. He had not even held a gun since he was conscripted into Germany’s military near the end of World War II. Then in 1980, he learned the Austrian military was seeking a new sidearm. Without any formal training in firearm design, he devised the first Glock model, the [Glock 17](//www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/11/18/armed-and-unready/419a50bf-23b0-4175-93ee-33211044c8df/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7), named for being his 17th patent after inventions such as a variation on the collapsible shovel, according to the Glock company. Mr. Glock gradually disappeared from the public eye, even as the 9mm handgun he crafted built a global presence. He increasingly spent his time behind the walls of a lakeside estate in Velden Am Wörthersee in southern Austria. His company, meanwhile, adopted a strategy of aggressive dealmaking and promotion. The goal was to make selling points out of characteristics that were initially mocked, particularly the Glock’s lightweight, polymer frame and blocky metal barrel. Glock sponsored elaborate displays at trade shows and pitched stories to publications such as Soldier of Fortune, which ran a [glowing piece ](//glockhistory.com/2020/06/12/soldier-of-fortune-oct-1984-introduces-us-to-plastic-perfection/)in 1984 titled “Plastic Perfection” on the Glock 17. Mr. Glock already had the Austrian military contract and was supplying Norway’s armed forces and others. He wanted next to break into the U.S. market, with its huge retail gun sales and thousands of law enforcement agencies. The late 1980s worked to Mr. Glock’s advantage. Increasingly powerful drug gangs and other underworld groups left many police forces feeling outgunned and imperiled. Glock marketed its handgun as an answer. Police departments across the United States were given Glocks to test on shooting ranges. Discounts were offered. Company envoys touted the weapon’s reliability in all kinds of weather. Unlike a six-shot revolver, the standard Glock had clips [holding 17](//us.glock.com/en/pistols/g17) rounds. (Later models expanded to 33.) Police started calling the 9mm Glocks “wonder nines.” Glock set up a U.S. plant in Smyrna, Ga., and departments began to line up. In 1988, the D.C. police suspended normal bidding procedures and [rushed to purchase ](//www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/11/12/recycled-dc-police-guns-tied-to-crimes/f75ad9b4-263a-43d1-aed9-d2e1e4a30fc1/?itid=lk_inline_manual_17)4,300 Glocks for $1.3 million to replace its Smith & Wesson and Colt revolvers. Currently, over 65 percent of federal, state and local agencies in the United States have Glock pistols, according to the company. The Glock is also used by police and military in nearly 50 countries. “And this gun, when it first arrived in the U.S., was disparaged as ugly, as handgun Tupperware,” Paul M. Barrett, the author of “ [Glock: The Rise of America’s Gun](//www.amazon.com/Glock-Americas-Paul-M-Barrett/dp/0307719952)” (2012), [said](//www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=145035468) on NPR’s “Tell Me More.” Barrett noted that Glock’s plan to court U.S. police departments was deliberate. “That would give the gun credibility in the much larger, much more lucrative civilian market, where you can charge full price and get your full profit margin,” he said. Yet the gun also represented the rise in firepower on America’s streets among gangs, drug networks and others. The Glock was mentioned in rap songs for decades by artists such as Wu-Tang Clan, [Snoop Dogg](//kanto.co/lyrics/snoop-dogg/bang-out) and Lil Wayne, helping give it a gangster mystique that drew concern from police forces even as they adopted the same handgun. Congressional hearings were called over the Glock’s light-touch trigger and rapid-fire capacity — issues raised by gun-control groups after a [Glock ](//vpc.org/studies/vatechgunsbackgrounder.pdf)was used in the 2007 [massacre ](//www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/local/virginia-tech-ten-years-later/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25)at Virginia Tech that claimed 32 lives. Mr. Glock rarely gave interviews and declined to address outcry from gun-control advocates. All the while, the Glock increasingly found its way into popular culture in films such as “Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines” and “The Matrix Reloaded,” both from 2003. “Get yourself a Glock and lose that nickel-plated sissy pistol,” actor Tommy Lee Jones said in the 1998 [movie](//www.imdb.com/title/tt0120873/) “U.S. Marshals.” In 2021, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) released a [ video ](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcgpIIAYqGY)showing her putting a Glock in a holster and then purportedly walking through the streets of Washington with the concealed weapon. “The Glock … inherited all aspects of the American firearm heritage,” Barrett wrote in his book. “It was seen as an instrument of law and security, but also menace, danger and fear.” It’s unclear how much attention the reclusive Mr. Glock paid to it all. His few brushes with media came during court battles with his first wife and questions over his ties to Austrian far-right political figure [Jörg Haider](//www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/05/02/austrias-haider-resigns-as-head-of-freedom-party/8577135e-ab56-4b17-94fb-09e145c2f1ad/?itid=lk_inline_manual_31) — and after Mr. Glock remarkably fended off an apparent murder attempt in 1999. The plot was hatched by his financial adviser, Charles Ewert, to conceal his embezzlement from Mr. Glock’s company, authorities said. Mr. Glock was ambushed in a garage in Luxembourg by a hired assailant, a former professional wrestler named Jacques Pêcheur, who wielded a hard rubber mallet. Mr. Glock, who was 70 at the time, fought back and managed to knock out some of Pêcheur’s teeth. Ewert and Pêcheur were [convicted](//www.nzherald.co.nz/world/murderers-of-austrian-gunmaker-jailed/6WGSGGLO5OF2EOK3MHVCXWNBWE/) in 2003 of attempted murder. Mr. Glock’s company was investigated for fiscal improprieties, such as concealing income through shell companies. Some company officials were prosecuted, but Mr. Glock was not charged. “I was fighting for my life,” Mr. Glock [told ](//www.thehighroad.org/index.php?threads/forbes-article-about-gaston-glock.14084/)Forbes in 2003, recalling the assault. “The attack was the best thing that happened to me,” he added. “Otherwise, I would have gone on trusting [Ewert].” Gaston Glock was born July 19, 1929, in Vienna. His father worked on the Austrian railroad; his mother was a homemaker. He studied mechanical engineering at a college in Vienna and later took jobs that included manager of a car-radiator factory. He and his first wife, Helga, opened a business in 1963 in their garage in Deutsch-Wagram outside Vienna, using a metal press to make consumer items such as curtain rods and brass fittings. They later won a contract to make knives for the Austrian Army. Through his military connections, Mr. Glock heard about Austria’s search in 1980 for a new service pistol. In 2021, Forbes estimated Mr. Glock’s personal fortune at $1.1 billion. Among his personal projects was construction of Austria’s [Glock Horse Performance Center](http://www.ghpc.at/en/at/home/), which hosts races and other events. After his divorce from Helga Glock in 2011, she began litigation to seek alimony and a greater share in the company. She was awarded alimony but lost her bid for other payments. Mr. Glock had three children from that marriage: a daughter, Brigitte, and sons Gaston Jr. and Robert. In 2011, Mr. Glock married Kathrin Tschikof, his nurse after he had a stroke in 2008. Full information on survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Glock did not publicly discuss company plans, but his strategic business sense was often on display. He apparently anticipated the [assault weapons ban ](//abcnews.go.com/US/understanding-1994-assault-weapons-ban-ended/story?id=65546858)signed by President Bill Clinton in 1994 that, among other things, limited gun magazine capacity to 10 rounds. (The ban [expired ](//www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/05/14/gop-will-let-gun-ban-expire/72149b13-6a55-4d5a-b8e5-6526e70a3d40/?itid=lk_inline_manual_46)in 2004.) The new regulations were initially seen as a blow to Glock. But Mr. Glock had a workaround. He correctly predicted that guns made before 1994 were not covered. For years, he had Glock plants operating round-the-clock. “Glock had this huge stockpile of the very equipment that many gun owners wanted to get because it was banned,” Barrett said, “and the value of that equipment skyrocketed.” [World News](/)|| [Latest News](/news)|| [U.S. News](../../us-news) [Source link](//www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/12/28/gaston-glock-handgun-dies/)",

    "text": "La verità crea comunione, unità, avvicina i distanti e crea relazione. Ecco perché la difesa della verità è una e propria missione per i cristiani, custodi di un patrimonio universale: il messaggio del Risorto. A ricordarcelo sono le storie come quella di san Marco di Aretusa, vescovo nel IV secolo della città siriana che oggi è Er Rastan. Accusato inizialmente di non essere abbastanza deciso contro l’arianesimo (forse perché preoccupato proprio della ferita provocata dalla diffusione dell’eresia e non volendo creare spaccature ancora più profonde nella Chiesa), nel 360 Marco chiarì la sua ortodossia e questo fece sparire i “sospetti” su di lui. Nel 361 fu costretto a fuggire a causa della presa di potere di Giuliano l’Apostata che voleva restaurare il paganesimo. Tornò, però, quando venne a sapere che i preti erano stati imprigionati e rischiavano la vita. Marco aveva fatto distruggere un tempio pagano e questo, al suo ritorno, gli costò l’arresto e le torture, alle quali, però, sopravvisse. Si dedicò all’evangelizzazione dei pagani fino alla morte nel 364 e la sua eredità è un chiaro invito a scegliere sempre la difesa della verità e la cura della comunione. Altri santi.
