    "text": "Japan's Mount Fuji snowless for longest time ever For the longest time on record, Japan’s Mount Fuji has been without snow. As of Halloween, the country’s tallest mountain was still without snow. This marks the longest period on record, The Weather Channel reported. The volcano’s snowcap begins forming on Oct. 2 on average, The Guardian said . Last year, snow was first detected there on Oct. 5. Japan saw warmer than average temperatures in September and October, The Weather Channel said. The country had its joint hottest summer on record this year with temperatures between June and August being 1.76C (3.1F) higher than an average, BBC News reported. “In September, temperatures continued to be warmer than expected as the sub-tropical jet stream’s more northerly position allowed a warmer southerly flow of air over Japan,” BBC News said. “October has seen the heat ease slightly, but it has still been a warmer than average month.” Yutaka Katsuta, a forecaster at Kofu Local Meteorological Office, said comparative data became available in 1894, and this year beats the previous record of Oct. 26 – which had been recorded twice, in 1955 and 2016, according to The Guardian. He said climate change might have a degree of impact on the delay in the snowcap’s formation. Fewer climbers tackled Mount Fuji this year, according to The Guardian, after Japanese authorities introduced an entry fee and a daily cap on numbers to fight overtourism. Mount Fuji last erupted about 300 years ago, and it was has been immortalized in countless artworks, including Hokusai’s “Great Wave,” The Guardian said.

    "text": "Conflicte Bèl·lic al Pròxim Orient L’ONU denuncia greus abusos a Cisjordània Nacions Unides (ONU) va reclamar ahir a Israel que acabi amb els “assassinats il·legals i la violència dels colons contra la població palestina” als territoris ocupats. L’Oficina de Drets Humans de l’ONU va presentar un informe que denuncia greus abusos per part de les forces de seguretat i els colons israelians, entre els quals “detencions il·legals i maltractament de detinguts”. L’alt comissionat per als Drets Humans, Volker Türk, va alertar del “ràpid deteriorament de la situació dels drets humans a la Cisjordània” i va demanar a Israel que “aturi immediatament” l’ús de tàctiques i armament militar “en contextos d’aplicació de la llei”. “L’ús de força innecessària o desproporcionada i l’aplicació de restriccions de moviment àmplies, arbitràries i discriminatòries que afecten els palestins són extremadament preocupants”, va afegir Türk sobre les conclusions de l’informe. El document certifica que entre el 7 d’octubre i el 27 d’octubre han mort tres-cents palestins a Cisjordània, inclosa Jerusalem Est, dels quals setanta-nou eren nens. Segons l’alt comissionat, les violacions documentades ara repeteixen el patró d’altres denúncies durant la “llarga ocupació israeliana de Cisjordània”, però “la intensitat de la violència i la repressió actuals no s’havia vist en anys”. Israel va reaccionar a l’informe qualificant-lo de “bastant ridícul”, en paraules Tal Heinrich, portaveu de l’oficina del primer ministre. Heinrich va criticar que el document no té en compte les amenaces a les que s’exposen les seves forces de seguretat a l’hora de “mantenir aquest front tan tranquil com sigui possible”. Cisjordània ha viscut aquest 2023 l’any més violent en dues dècades, amb més de mig miler de palestins morts en xocs amb tropes i atacants israelians. Ahir mateix, un jove palestí va perdre la vida durant una operació de l’exèrcit a Ramal·là, on catorze persones més van resultar ferides al centre de la ciutat. De la part israeliana, aquest any han perdut la vida 41 persones, la majoria colons.

    "title": "13 Illegal Interview Questions Hiring Managers Still Try To Ask",
    "text": "13 Illegal Interview Questions Hiring Managers Still Try To Ask\nInterviews can be nerve-wracking. But what do you do when an employer asks you a very personal — and illegal — question?\nIt may be 2024, but some companies are still stuck in the archaic ages. That means from time to time, they can ask questions that have long been deemed inappropriate, not to mention illegal. You do not have to answer these questions if they come up as they do not pertain to the job at hand.\nA quick perusal of job boards shows that these illegal questions still tend to pop up during interviews.\n1. Are You Married?\nThis question is mostly directed at women, though it has been asked of men, as well. Not only is it illegal to ask you about your marital status, your employer cannot ask if you are living with a domestic partner, either.\nSimply put, your personal life — including your dating life — is nobody's business but your own and has zero impact on your ability to do your job.\n2. Are You a US Citizen?\nWhile you do need credentials to be able to legally work in the United States, you do not have to be a citizen. Employers will eventually be aware of your citizenship status, given that you have to pay taxes, but it's not something they can ask in an interview.\nAdditionally, an employer cannot ask you if your parents are citizens or variations thereof.\n3. Are You (Do You Plan to Become) Pregnant?\nOne of the major concerns that may spark this question is whether a woman will leave when she has a baby. However, no matter if you are pregnant, wish to become pregnant, or don't plan to have children, this question doesn't belong in an interview.\nIf the hiring manager brings up the subject, you're well within your rights to say that it's a personal question between you and your family.\n4. Have You Ever Been Arrested?\nThis question is a doozy, because while an employer can reject your application due to a criminal history, an arrest or even spending a night in jail does not equate to guilt.\nSometimes people are erroneously arrested based on false information and some have spent a night in jail without being charged. That's why it's important to have all of the facts and why only convictions should count against you.\n5. Have You Been Injured on the Job Before?\nEvery employer wants to mitigate risk, but asking someone if they've suffered an injury in the workplace before is unacceptable. Even if you were injured, that should not play into whether or not you get a job with someone else.\nYou do not have to disclose this to any prospective employer and can ignore the question if asked.\n6. Are You a Republican or Democrat?\nAn employer cannot ask you what your political affiliation is if it does not pertain to the job. This is considered a form of discrimination. They don't need to know who you voted or plan to vote for, nor do they need to know your take on any specific hot-button issues.\nWith political tensions as escalated as they are, it's a good idea to redirect the conversation, or politely refuse to answer.\n7. Are You Disabled?\nWhile there are certain disabilities that can impact your ability to do a job, employers cannot come right out and ask if you're disabled. That is your choice to disclose when and if necessary. An employer also cannot ask if you are taking any medications or about your mental health.\nIf you do decide to disclose a disability, your employer is within their rights to ask what they can do to help you overcome it in the workplace.\n8. What Is Your Financial Standing?\nSome positions, such as those dealing with handling money or sensitive information, require someone to be in good financial standing and have a good credit score. However, it's not okay for a hiring manager to ask you personally what your financial standing is like.\nYour credit score, with rare exceptions, and the amount of money or assets you own is nobody's business but yours.\n9. What Religion Are You?\nThis is seemingly another way to discriminate against prospective employees, by asking them what religion they are. It's also illegal.\nIt's nobody's business whether you are Catholic, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or one of many other religions. Unless you're working with a specific type of organization, you can remain mum on this one.\n10. Do You Have Childcare?\nThis is another personal question that seems to come up from time to time. Employers want to know who watches your children to generally get an idea of how reliable the childcare aspect is.\nThe concern is that you'll miss time at work because you have nobody to watch your children, and time is money. Regardless of how innocuous this question may seem, it's illegal to ask.\n11. Any Genetic or Physical Characteristics\nOther questions among those that are illegal include inquiries into your weight, age, gender, sexual orientation, race, or nationality. In a private questionnaire, you have the opportunity to disclose some of those variables, but they cannot be brought up during an interview.\nThese types of questions can be viewed as discriminatory, especially if they were to keep you from getting a position you're otherwise qualified for.\n12. How Old Are You?\nFor most people, their age has no bearing on their abilities, but some employers tend to want to hire younger or older, depending on their company values and needs.\nThis question could actually be disguised as another question, such as what year were you born? How old are your children, or even, do you have any grandchildren? All variations of asking for your age are illegal and you do not have to answer.\n13. Where Do You Live?\nUnless you are required to live within a specific distance of your job — such as if you're on a local police force or you work in a government capacity in a region — employers are not entitled to know anything about your living situation.\nThis also goes for whether you rent or own, or what you pay per month for your home.",

    "text": "Zweite Erde? Hoffnungen um potenziellen Erdzwilling Trappist-1 d werden enttäuscht\nDie Suche nach einer zweiten Erde konzentrierte sich auf das Trappist-1-System. Nun zeigen neue Daten des „James Webb“-Teleskops ein unerwartetes Ergebnis.\nMontréal – Wenn es um Planeten außerhalb unseres Sonnensystems geht, auf denen es möglicherweise Leben geben könnte, dann fällt immer ein Name: „Trappist-1“. Dabei handelt es sich um einen roten Zwergstern, der nur etwa 40 Lichtjahre von der Erde entfernt ist und von sieben Planeten umkreist wird, die etwa erdgroß sind. Mehrere dieser Planeten befinden sich in der sogenannten „habitablen Zone“ des Sterns – das heißt, auf ihnen herrschen Temperaturen, die flüssiges Wasser an der Oberfläche möglich machen.\nDeshalb gilt das „Trappist-1“-System als die größte Hoffnung bei Forschenden, eine „zweite Erde“ im Universum zu finden. Seit das „James Webb“-Weltraumteleskop aktiv ist, kann die Forschungsgemeinschaft die „Trappist-1“-Planeten genauer untersuchen und mehr über sie herausfinden. Dabei steht vor allem eine Frage im Vordergrund: Haben die Planeten in der habitablen Zone Atmosphären?\nSuche nach einer zweiten Erde: Der Exoplanet Trappist-1 d ist es wohl nicht\n„Letztendlich möchten wir wissen, ob es irgendwo anders etwas Ähnliches wie die Umwelt gibt, die wir auf der Erde genießen, und unter welchen Bedingungen dies möglich ist“, sagt Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb (University of Chicago und Université de Montréal in einer Nasa-Mitteilung. „Während das ‚James Webb‘-Weltraumteleskop der Nasa uns erstmals die Möglichkeit gibt, diese Frage bei erdähnlichen Planeten zu untersuchen, können wir Trappist-1 d zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt von der Liste potenzieller Erdzwillinge oder -cousins ausschließen.“ Die Forschungsergebnisse wurden im Fachmagazin The Astrophysical Journal veröffentlicht.\nDer Planet Trappist-1 d ist aus der Sicht des Sterns der dritte Planet und befindet sich am Rand der habitablen Zone. Er benötigt nur vier Erdtage, um den Stern einmal zu umrunden. Mithilfe des NIRSpec-Instruments des Weltraumteleskops hat das Forschungsteam nach Molekülen Ausschau gehalten, die in der Erdatmosphäre vorkommen – beispielsweise Wasser, Methan oder Kohlendioxid. Gefunden wurden jedoch keine.\n„Webb“-Teleskop entdeckt keine Atmosphäre bei Trappist-1 d\nFür das Forschungsteam gibt es verschiedene Gründe, warum um Trappist-1 d keine Atmosphäre entdeckt wurde, wie Piaulet-Ghorayeb erklärt: „Er könnte eine extrem dünne Atmosphäre haben, die schwer zu erkennen ist, ähnlich wie auf dem Mars. Alternativ könnte es sehr dichte Wolken in großer Höhe geben, die unsere Erkennung bestimmter atmosphärischer Signaturen blockieren – eher wie auf der Venus. Oder es könnte sich um einen kargen Felsen ohne jegliche Atmosphäre handeln.“\nAllerdings befindet sich Trappist-1 d auch in einem Umfeld, das es schwer macht, eine Atmosphäre dauerhaft zu halten: Rote Zwergsterne sind bekannt dafür, dass sie sehr aktiv sind. Sie schleudern häufig Materie und hochenergetische Strahlung ins Weltall, die die Atmosphäre von kleinen Planeten wegreißen kann – vor allem, wenn die Planeten sich nahe an dem Stern befinden, wie es Trappist-1 d tut. Rote Zwergsterne sind jedoch auch die am häufigsten vorkommenden Sterne in unserer Galaxie, weshalb die Forschung hofft, Planeten zu finden, die im Orbit um einen roten Zwerg ihre Atmosphäre halten können.\nHaben die anderen Trappist-1-Planeten vielleicht Atmosphären?\n„Wir stehen noch ganz am Anfang, wenn es darum geht, mit ‚Webb‘ nach Atmosphären auf erdähnlichen Planeten zu suchen und die Grenze zwischen Planeten, die eine Atmosphäre halten können, und solchen, die dies nicht können, zu definieren“, betont Co-Autor Björn Benneke. Die Beobachtung der äußeren „Trappist-1“-Planeten mit dem „Webb“-Teleskop läuft derzeit. Wie das Ergebnis aussehen könnte, ist noch unklar. Auf der einen Seite sind die Planeten e, f, g und h weiter vom Stern entfernt – es könnte ihnen also etwas leichter fallen, ihre potenziellen Atmosphären zu halten.\nDurch ihre größere Entfernung vom Stern sind sie jedoch auch etwas kühler, was es dem Weltraumteleskop schwerer macht, atmosphärische Signaturen aufzuspüren. „Die Hoffnung für die Atmosphären der Trappist-1-Planeten ist noch nicht verloren“, muntert Piaulet-Ghorayeb auf. „Auch wenn wir auf Planet d keine deutlichen atmosphärischen Signaturen gefunden haben, besteht dennoch die Möglichkeit, dass die äußeren Planeten viel Wasser und andere atmosphärische Komponenten enthalten.“ (tab)",

    "text": "'So sorry': Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson apologises for horror loss to Germany Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson apologised for Australia's dismal opening clash in Paris , following the 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Germany . The 2016 Olympic champions thoroughly outclassed the Matildas, with Australia lucky to walk away with only three goals conceded after Germany's strikers failed to convert on several chances. Germany led 2-0 at half time through headers off corners before Julie Brand tapped in a third in the 67th minute.

Speaking to media after the match, Gustavsson did not shy away from the task ahead, while delivering a message to the fans who woke up early to catch the match. \"I just want to say I'm so sorry to let down the fans back home that put their alarms on a 3am in the morning to get up and support us. \"It's just amazing to see the support back home and I know we disappointed a lot of people. Matildas star Steph Catley, who suffered a head knock in the first half, said the result was a wake up call for the 2023 World Cup semi-finalists, who will need to make adjustments to their set piece defence. \"We have two more games and we have to turn it around quickly. We have a lot to learn from here,\" Catley said after the match. Watch every moment, every medal of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 live and free on Channel 9 and 9Now . Plus, every event streaming ad free, live and on demand with 4K on Stan Sport . \"I think at times we were well on top and let two set pieces affect the game in a very negative way. There are things that we can fix nice and quickly, which is good — but we just need to be better. \"We conceded two set pieces. We are usually much, much better on set pieces. It is a wake-up call and it is not to our standard and we need to be better for the next game and turn this tournament around.\" Gustavsson assured fans back home his team will be better against Zambia at 3am on Sunday, saying the team will show its usual resolve in the next game. \"The one thing I know about this team is that when they're backed against a corner and there's a lot of shit thrown at them with curve balls and different ways, a loss three-nil or baggage going missing … they never use these things as excuses. \"This side is so physical normally, we win all the one-on-one duels, there's aggressiveness there, we're running and our speed beats teams. But it wasn't really there tonight.\"",

    "text": "With a dizzying array of streaming services available, there was no shortage of great TV this year—and while io9 has already shared our top 20 shows of 2023, today we’re revealing our top TV moments… all 50 of them. These are the moments when we laughed, cheered, shed a tear, shrieked in disbelief, and/or realized we were witnessing game-changing turning points, for better and sometimes worse .\nTwisted Metal: The Opening Photo: Skip Bolen/Peacock In most shows, the ending is the best part. For Twisted Metal , the ending is certainly great, but it’s the show’s opening, a high octane action set piece directly giving the feel of the game itself, that sucks you in and sets you up for the rest of the series.\nThe Righteous Gemstones: Apocalypse Now Photo: Jake Giles Netter/HBO The season three finale of the dark religious comedy went from hilarious with Baby Billy’s Bible Bonkers and Walton Goggins hosting his Family Feud-style show to a full-on start of the apocalypse, complete with locust plague cliffhanger. We’re excited to see more supernatural shenanigans on the Danny McBride-led series.\nGood Omens: The Kiss Photo: Cian Oba-Smith/Prime Video Season one of Good Omens established the long-standing—like, since the beginning of time itself—friendship between the demon Crowley (David Tennant) and the angel Aziraphale (Michael Sheen), but fans couldn’t help hoping that the crackling chemistry between them meant their relationship went deeper. Season two saw the pair tackling a mystery revolving around multiple romantic quandaries, including their own… and ended with the passionate liplock Good Omens devotees have been pining for, only to see the “ineffable husbands” forced apart (cliffhanger alert!) due to celestial circumstances.\nThe Mandalorian: Grogu’s Ride Image: Lucasfilm Grogu gets his very own vehicle? And it’s the hollowed-out remains of IG-12? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.\nBluey: Muffin’s Granny Haggling Screenshot: Disney Jr./Disney+ A yard sale episode sees the return of Bluey and Bingo as the grannies, and adds onto the lore with Muffin getting her own alter-grannie persona. The iconic scarf, the position of power on the motorized scooter, and her haggling against a real crotchety grannie wins this episode with sheer comedic gold.\nAdventure Time: Fionna and Cake: Marshall and Gary Image: Max While Fionna goes off on her adventures, we get a side-story with Marshall and Gary falling in love in their own little romantic comedy. We see their meet-cute over baked goods and their relationship develops with Gary encouraging Marshall to forge his own path in the face of his domineering mother. It’s so sweet.\nGoosebumps: The Doppleganger Reveal Photo: Disney/David Astorga The horror in the new Goosebumps creatively subverted expectations for a YA show. In “Give Yourself Goosebumps,” seeing James and his doppelgangers explode into yellow goo when killed was so gross and funny.\nStar Trek: Picard: Seven Sees Voyager Screenshot: Paramount+ Picard’s final season was understandably focused on its nostalgic hurrah to the cast of The Next Generation, but in a pitch-perfect moment it remembered it had a crewmate from another Trek show to honor as well. As the Titan circled the Fleet Museum’s collection of iconic ships of the line, Seven of Nine got to point out her home, the Voyager, the finest ship in Starfleet, to the young Jack Crusher, and pontificate on how far her family had seen her come in the years since. A perfect moment for Jeri Ryan, and a touching tribute to Star Trek: Voyager.\nDead Ringers: Twin Swap Photo: Niko Tavernise/Prime Video Prime Video’s Dead Ringers series, starring Rachel Weisz in a tour-de-force dual performance, made it clear it was exploring its own version of the story made famous by David Cronenberg’s 1988 cult medical horror tale. Still, it seemed inevitable that the series would have to lead to the same conclusion as the film, with the codependent twins dying side by side. Nope! In a shocking cap to its cleverly crafted story, Dead Ringers instead engineered the ultimate “twin swap,” ending things on a note far more unsettling and eerily unresolved than Cronenberg’s gory full-stop.\nMobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury: Eri Is Aerial Screenshot: Crunchyroll Gundam fans had long assumed that something dark was up with Witch From Mercury’s lead mobile suit, ever since little Ericht Samiya from the show’s prologue mysteriously vanished in the actual show. Glimpses here and there of a connection to Suletta and the Gundam Aerial flickered throughout the show’s first season, but it wasn’t until season two, in a moment of shock as the Aerial destroyed rival pilot Sophie, it was made explicit that Eri’s very soul was what drove the Aerial’s drone systems and the suit’s supernatural connection to Suletta. Truly, Gundam wanted to remind us it doesn’t mess around.\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off: Knives’ Musical Moment Image: Netflix By sidelining its titular character, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off decides to offer deeper interior lives to nearly everyone in the primary cast of the hit graphic novel and film. Instead of being Scott’s high school girlfriend, Knives gradually comes into her own and is given a chance to figure out who she is outside of his orbit. As outlandish as the show is, watching Knives come to realize she’s got an affinity for the guitar is one of its most real moments—even if you’ve never picked up an instrument, a song has given a moment like this, from the colors to the feeling of realization that you’ve just experienced something life-changing.\nRick and Morty: Rick vs. Rick Prime\nBattle of the Ricks | Rick and Morty | adult swim This season’s Rick and Morty saw the smartest man in the universe confront his ultimate nemesis : a version of himself with the same level of genius but none, absolutely none, of the same heart. After a tech-fueled battle that could have gone either way, Rick ended up beating Rick Prime to death with just his angry, angry fists. Though he’d just achieved his greatest dream, the feeling was nowhere as cathartic as Rick thought it would be—and without that sense of closure, it’s something that’s clearly going to haunt him as the show progresses.\nSecret Invasion: …Super Skrull? Photo: Gareth Gatrell/Marvel It was awful , but it was also awfully memorable as Emila Clarke’s G’iah gained the power of every hero in the MCU , and then physically manifested a few of them.\nWhat We Do in the Shadows: Guillermo’s Human Choice Photo: Russ Martin/FX What happens when a familiar who’s been trying to get his master to turn him into a vampire for years gets frustrated and takes matters into his own hands? For Guillermo (the always delightful Harvey Guillén) in the most recent season of What We Do in the Shadows, it meant a lot of terrified sneaking around once he realized Nandor (Kayvan Novak) is obligated to kill him for the betrayal. Plus, there were a lot of awkward physical blunders when it became clear his Van Helsing blood was making his body resist any kind of supernatural transformation. Ultimately, he had to admit the moral issues that come with being a bloodsucker were something he simply couldn’t get past—and in the season finale, he decided he’s better off staying human. It’ll mean a whole new dynamic for Guillermo moving forward, and it’s one we can’t wait to see play out.\nStar Trek: Lower Decks: The Promotion Image: Paramount+ It’s a small thing—a single pip added on their uniform collars, and a title change from Ensign to Lieutenant Jr. Grade. But Lower Decks opening its fourth season with this long-awaited recognition of how far its characters had come over the show was not just vital for that recognition, it also unlocked a season of stories that let the show push them in fascinating directions as they learned to grapple with even the slightest bit of new authority. In a show that had felt reticent to change too much in prior seasons, it was a moment for the show to begin closing one chapter and starting another.\nFoundation: Cleon Gets Spaced Image: Apple TV+ Lee Pace’s Brother Day—the smarmy, dangerously self-centered ruler of a galactic empire lorded over by a continuous cycle of clones—thought he was the most clever version of Emperor Cleon ever. But as we came to learn in Foundation season two , his actions were all engineered by Demerzel (Laura Birn), his android majordomo who’s really been running the show for centuries. That would have been satisfying enough, but to see the worst guy in the universe expire in the worst way possible–being spaced by people who’re tired of living under his thumb, and crumble away into frozen dust–was a deliciously triumphant moment. Even the fact that Demerzel can just uncork another Cleon to fill his place doesn’t diminish it.\nDoctor Who: The DoctorDonna Returns Screenshot: BBC/Disney+ The first of Doctor Who’s anniversary specials danced around the danger of Donna Noble remembering her time with the Doctor, but when it became necessary for the now 14th incarnation to unlock her memories, we got an incredible performance out of David Tennant and Catherine Tate, playing the drama and the grief of it all perfectly alongside the jubilation of Donna remembering just who she is, and who she’d become.\nWheel of Time: Egwene Strikes Back Photo: Jan Thijs/Prime Video Captured and enslaved by an invading kingdom that forces women with magical abilities to serve as weapons, the kind-hearted Egwene (Madeleine Madden) endures torture and humiliation, and her spirit teeters on the edge of breaking. As she fights to stay strong, her pain causes an internal shift that pushes her to inform Renna (Xelia Mendes-Jones), the woman who’s literally holding her leash, that she’s going to find a way to kill her—and then making good on that promise in Wheel of Time’s most emotional season two moment .\nThe Legend of Vox Machina: Grog Saying “Fuck Shit Up” Image: Prime Video The Legend of Vox Machina is a show built on fan service for those who experienced the original actual play series. Whether you’re a longtime fan or just coming in, watching these moments play out can be extremely satisfying—so when Grog bellows out the words “fuck shit up,” you know the show’s about to have some fun. It’s just five minutes of fist-pumping carnage as everyone in the party gets a moment to shine and look cool while beating (or shooting, stabbing, etc.) raiders to bits, and it’s fun as hell.\nBlue Eye Samurai: The Ronin and the Bride\nBlue Eye Samurai | The Ronin and the Bride | Official Clip | Netflix Blue Eye Samurai’s Mizu is complicated—they have to be, as they’re a biracial woman living as a man in Edo-period Japan. As they’re slashing up a crime boss’ foot soldiers during the fifth episode, we watch them live a peaceful, fairly idyllic life as a simple wife. It can’t last forever, obviously, and it’s a riot when things eventually break bad around her and they’re betrayed by their family. In a pretty great season overall, watching Mizu briefly give up their revenge quest and then go back to it because it’s all they’ve ever known is devastating. Hell of a play, though.\nOne Piece: The Barrel Pledge Photo: Casey Crafford/Netflix Netflix’s One Piece adaptation largely shines thanks to the winning chemistry of the lead Straw Hat Pirates. Like in the anime and manga, they all play off each other very well, and it helps that Luffy (Iñaki Godoy) is so goofy and charming that it makes complete sense why the others would stay with him. So when the season finale ends with the gang declaring their dreams to one another (mixed with scenes from previous episodes where they’re played by younger actors), it really does feel like the true start of an adventure that longtime fans have experienced for years on end.\nCastlevania: Nocturne: Olrox’s Backstory Image: Netflix Unlike its predecessor, Castlevania: Nocturne is more firmly rooted in real world history. The decision gives greater texture to its characters of color, in particular the Aztec vampire Olrox. Instead of being a one-note bloodsucker who simply killed Richter Belmont’s mother because that’s just what they do, he reveals himself to be a more complicated figure who wanted revenge for the lover Julia took from him. It’s an interesting intersection of race and queerness in a show that clearly has such things on its mind, and it makes him one of the more intriguing characters in the two-series franchise thus far.\nScavenger’s Reign: Levi’s Time-Lapse Image: Max Of all the characters in Max’s Scavengers Reign, it’s the helpful robot Levi who’s best equipped to survive its hostile alien world. Deeply curious about the world around them while still actively aware of the planet’s perils, Levi manages to fight off the season’s sort of Big Bad (a big tadpole/monkey thing dubbed “Hollow) with the power of life. It’s not the first time we’ve seen the meaning of life displayed like this, but it doesn’t take away from how stunning it is to watch. Like Scavengers Reign itself, the universe is mesmerizing, horrific, and disgusting all in one breath, and the overwhelming realization of that is what makes life worth living.\nMobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury: Suletta Loses the Holder Title Screenshot: Crunchyroll The Witch from Mercury’s first season saw Suletta Mercury become one of the most prominent figures at her school and quickly work her way up the ranks by being incredibly in sync with her mech Aerial. Season two is all about bringing her to a low point, and that eventual turn is utterly devastating. It’s one thing for Guel to beat her thanks in part to Miorine and Suletta’s mom Prospera, it’s another to watch Suletta get her heart broken by her wife in front of the guy who just beat her. In a season where episodes ended at the worst possible time, this moment was a particular standout.\nMonarch: Legacy of Monsters: Godzilla vs. Nuke Image: Apple TV+ Legendary’s Monsterverse has loved to reaffirm time and again the U.S. military has been right there alongside the growing threat of Titans throughout the years. More often than not, that military is just hopeless against the sheer might of big guys like Godzilla and Kong, and as Monarch: Legacy of Monsters shows, they’ve made some stupid moves in the past.Their bright idea after using uranium to lure Godzilla to Bikini Atoll is to detonate a nuke in its face. That doesn’t work, obviously, but it’s hilarious (and extremely rude) to watch them try. With that information in mind, maybe Godzilla’s been right in wrecking up U.S. cities in the last few movies.\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off: The Musical Screenshot: Netflix Scott Pilgrim Takes Off had a lot of fun with the metacommentary in creating an allusion to the live-action adaptation within its own spin on the comics with the supposedly-Young-Neil-scripted Scott Pilgrim’s Precious Little Life adaptation of Scott’s, well, precious little life. But it couldn’t top the sheer, cheeky joy of Knives and Stephen pitching Matthew Patel himself into the starring role of a musical version—complete with its own jaunty spin on the first episode of the show, to boot.\nStar Trek: Picard: Last Flight of the Enterprise-D Screenshot: Paramount+ Desperate times call for desperate measures, and when Picard and his friends found themselves in a race to stop the Borg Queen from turning Starfleet against itself, where could they go but to their old home? Preserved immaculately by Geordi LaForge, getting to see the Enterprise-D in all her glory, for one last battle helmed by her beloved bridge officers, set the stage for Picard’s fond farewell.\nMobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury: Suletta and Miorine Reunite\nSuletta and Miorine’s Reunion | Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury Suletta and Miorine spent much of Witch From Mercury’s second season driven apart from each other, either by the growing tragedies of the narrative or more explicitly when Miorine tried to push Suletta away from her altogether in an attempt to keep her safe. True love can’t be kept apart for too long however, leading to Suletta’s fateful reunion with the woman she’d swore to protect, and one day wed, in one of the show’s most emotional moments.\nDoctor Who: “Hello, Old Soldier” Image: BBC Bernard Cribbins’ death earlier this year was already a heartbreaking blow to Doctor Who fans, but the tears flowed freely once again when the actor’s final performance posthumously arrived in “Wild Blue Yonder.” The Doctor’s elation at seeing an old friend again, and Cribbins, on fire as ever, hooting and hollering in Wilf’s wheelchair as he diligently waited for his granddaughter to return was all so sweet—and bittersweet too, as our farewell to our favorite grandad companion.\nThe Last of Us: Joel Saves Ellie Photo: Liane Hentscher/HBO The Last of Us’ grim climax has been known to fans of the games for so long, the question for the HBO show wasn’t whether or not it would happen, but how it could match it—and it did so spectacularly well in Joel’s tense assault on the Firefly facility. Cold, action-packed, and gut-wrenching in all the right ways, it translated the drama of the games’ final sequences perfectly.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds: Boimler Meets Spock Image: Paramount+ They say never meet your heroes, and while Strange New Worlds’ crossover episode with Lower Decks definitely got a lot of play out of just how alien Boimler and Mariner were to their predecessors aboard the Enterprise, their arrival was smartly leveraged by the show to do some great character work—especially the case for Mr. Spock, as he tried to grapple with the man he was becoming in the wake of exploring his romantic desires for Nurse Chapel and his human side.\nAhsoka: Return to the Clone Wars Image: Lucasfilm It took a few episodes but, eventually, Ahsoka did something fans had long dreamed of: recreated scenes from the Clone Wars in live-action. The flashbacks helped give Ahsoka’s backstory much-needed context, and having Hayden Christensen there didn’t hurt either.\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off: The Movie Screenshot: Netflix Almost every single thing about Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is meta, but our favorite weird, meta moment is when the show makes a Scott Pilgrim movie, imagining the events of the original Scott Pilgrim comic and movie.\nStar Trek: Picard: The Poker Game Image: Paramount+ No matter how it set out at first, there was perhaps no other way Star Trek: Picard could come to a final end. The day saved, the torched passed on to a new Next Generation, all that was left was for Jean-Luc and his old friends to celebrate closing one chapter of their lives, before heading apart from each other’s orbits again. And what else could they do, than play one last game of cards together? A wonderful good-bye indeed.\nThe Mandalorian: The New Republic Is Monstrous Image: Lucasfilm There’s a lot in The Mandalorian’s third season that doesn’t pan out—chalk it up to the fact that the show is always willing to conform to a comfortable status quo after gesturing at something fresh and exciting. And yet its examination of the New Republic through the eyes of political refugee Dr. Pershing is a truly rare and fascinating bit of critique, even before taking in the fact it’s a biting critique of the heroes of Star Wars’ original trilogy. Alas, “The Convert” couldn’t quite commit to its exploration of just how little the New Republic’s neoliberal engine differed from the bureaucracy of the Galactic Empire, pinning the true evils of its climactic torture of Dr. Pershing at the hands of Moff Gideon’s remnant agents. But for just a brief moment, The Mandalorian bared teeth as it’s never dared to before.\nOne Piece: Sanji’s Backstory Image: Netflix If you have friends who love the One Piece manga and anime, you’ve probably been warned that our favorite crew all have quite tragic backstories. Even with that warning we were not prepared for the reveal of why Sanji and Zeff are so loyal to one another despite their tough-love relationship. We discover that the two survived a shipwreck and Zeff gave Sanji what he thought were scraps to survive on; the build to the reveal that the scraps were actually all they had and Zeff had to eat his leg was shocking and heartbreaking all at once. Even being told to brace ourselves, we were not prepared for that.\nThe Fall of the House of Usher: The Masque of the Red Death Photo: Eike Schroter/Netflix Episode two of Fall of the House of Usher really set the tone for the series’ horror. Seeing the youngest Usher ignore safety protocols and decide to throw a rager in a dangerous, should-be-demolished warehouse—where his father’s company happens to be hiding dangerous, very illegal chemicals—was so stressful until the final moments of the episode. The sheer tension leading to punishment in the form of grotesque chemical-rain violence was built to sky-high levels… and it more than paid off in the carnage that followed.\nCastlevania: Nocturne: “Divine Bloodlines” Screenshot: Netflix The first Netflix Castlevania show gave fans of the games everything they thought they wanted when season two climaxed with Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard storming Dracula’s castle set to the iconic game track “Bloody Tears.” But spiritual successor Nocturne went one better in evoking the legendary gaming theme of its protagonist Richter, “Divine Bloodlines,” in a moment that wasn’t just incredible action, but a thoughtful connection to the generations of characters woven throughout Castlevania’s legacy.\nOur Flag Means Death: Calypso’s Birthday Photo: Nicola Dove/Max The beauty our pirate crew experiences in this episode is purely joyous. The makeup, the costumes, and comedy felt Shakespearean in the best ways. And wasn’t Con O’Neill as Izzy Hands utterly gorgeous as he performed “La Vie en rose”?\nMobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury: The Flash-Forward Ending Screenshot: Crunchyroll Witch From Mercury made the love of its protagonists—a heated topic of discussion throughout the show with the will-they/won’t-they of it all, especially when it comes to queer characters—a driving part of its final episode, leading to a flash-forward epilogue that confirmed everything fans of Suletta and Miorine always wanted: they were in love, they were married, and they were building a happy life together. It’s a shame Bandai tried to backtrack from it after the fact with cowardly acts of media censorship, but the company can’t hide what is right there in the show, no matter how hard it tries.\nPoker Face: Charlie Figures It Out Screenshot: Peacock/YouTube This happens in each episode, and always in a unique way, but it’s incredibly fun every single time. And it’s not because Charlie is finally solving the murder mystery that particular episode; she, and the audience, almost always know who did it beforehand. It’s that she finally finds that one specific clue or link that explains the how and why, and oh how satisfying it is. We can’t pick just one Poker Face puzzle, so this is a nod to them all.\nMrs. Davis: The British Knights Image: Peacock Mrs. Davis was a weird, wonderful show filled with weird, wonderful moments. One that sticks out though is the mid-season reveal that the series’ opening scene, which you assumed had actually happened, was in fact an elaborate Super Bowl commercial for the British Knights sneaker company featuring the Holy Grail. Like we said, it’s a wild show.\nStar Trek: Lower Decks: Mariner and Sito Image: Paramount+ For four seasons, we’ve wondered what Beckett Mariner’s deal was—her anti-authority persona masking what was deep down her innate desire to be the best she could in Starfleet, and her capability to be a great leader always clashing with her sense of self-sabotage. But in a touching moment that called back to the original The Next Generation episode the show takes its name from beautifully, we learned just why Mariner has always been fearful of the career laid out ahead of her—in a nuanced reckoning with the specters of DS9’s Dominion War in a way few contemporary Trek shows have actually tried to tackle before.\nFor All Mankind: The End of “Crossing the Line” Photo from episode five, for extra spoiler protection. The fourth season of For All Mankind is still in progress as you read this—so in this one instance, we’re going to tread carefully. But let’s just say the end of episode seven, “Crossing the Line,” which debuts December 22, features two of the show’s titans facing off, one of them asking one of the most ridiculous, amazing questions ever, and then the show dropping a mega-hit hip hop track over the end credits. We jumped up and cheered.\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off: Scott’s “Death” Image: Netflix The first episode of Science Saru and Netflix’s Scott Pilgrim anime feels off. Its beat-for-beat recreation of the opening parts of the film and the classic comic series almost feel too beat-for-beat. Is that really all it will be? Turns out, in a sudden poof of loonies and toonies as Scott falls in his fight with Matthew Patel at the end of the episode, we were about to get anything but—and that was a perfect surprise.\nSilo: The Final Reveal Image: Apple TV+ All through season one of Silo there’s a massive question hanging over everything: what’s outside the Silo? Is the world over, as everyone believes? Or have the characters actually been trapped under mysterious circumstances? The answer, it turns out, is kind of in the middle. In the final shot of the season, we learn the world is in fact over, but that there are many, many more silos.\nAhsoka: Ezra Comes Home Image: Lucasfilm Ezra’s initial return in Ahsoka was a somewhat muted affair, as Sabine and Ahsoka grappled with the strange new galaxy they found themselves in in their quest to find him and Thrawn alike. But the show saved the emotional Rebels reunion for its final moments, when Ezra, after years and years away, made his way back to his home, and to the New Republic… where a tearful Hera was waiting for him.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds: “Subspace Rhapsody”’s Grand Finale\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds | We Are One (Full Performance) | Paramount+ It’s remarkable enough alone that Strange New Worlds managed to pull together a musical episode, let one as filled with both great ditties and excellent character work to put a Trek spin on the high camp as what we got. But nothing in the episode quite beats the all singing, all dancing jazz hands of the climactic ensemble song “We Are One.” It’s goofy, it’s endearing, it wraps everything up in a neat musical bow—even as the characters involved are barrelling ahead on trajectories that are anything but neat—and it’s got Klingons having a boy band K-Pop moment. Delightful.\nDoctor Who: The Doctor Bi-Generates\nThe Fourteenth Doctor Bi-generates! | David Tennant to Ncuti Gatwa | The Giggle | Doctor Who Just… push! In one magical moment, Doctor Who did the unthinkable: gave its hero a chance to have it both ways, literally. Succumbing to a mortal wound from the villainous Toymaker, David Tennant’s 14th Doctor prepared to bid farewell… only to find his future self literally splitting off from him, giving us two Doctors, and a chase for the physician to heal thyself quite literally: a bit of Time Lord rehab out of order, as Ncuti Gatwa’s immediately charming 15th Doctor gives his past self the push to reflect, pause, and rest… if only so he can race out and begin his own adventures.\nThe Last of Us: “Long, Long Time” Photo: Liane Hentscher/HBO\nOn a list of memorable moments, it’s unorthodox to put a full episode, but we had to make an exception. Everything about this touching love story, sandwiched in the middle of a zombie show, was perfect. It was the moment everyone knew The Last of Us was something special.",
