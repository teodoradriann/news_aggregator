    "text": "Jakarta, CNN Indonesia —\nDavid de Gea they had a bad argument together Fiorentina when they play against Puskas Akademia in a UEFA Conference League playoff match at the Artemio Franchi Stadium, Florence, on Thursday afternoon (22/8) local time.\nAfter signing an official contract with Fiorentina for one year, last August 9, De Gea made his debut with the Italian Serie A club. The debut of the 33-year-old goalkeeper took place when Fiorentina hosted a Hungarian club, Puskas Akademia.\nThis is the first time in the last 446 days that De Gea has played a professional game. The last time De Gea played was when he played for Manchester United in the 2023 FA Cup final against Manchester City. At that time Man City won 2-1.\nSEVENTEEN\nCHECK TO CONTINUE WITH INDEX\nUnfortunately, the first match after 1 year, 2 months and 19 days of unemployment did not go well for De Gea. The Spanish goalkeeper immediately conceded three goals in his first game with Fiorentina.\nDe Gea’s goal even conceded two goals after just 12 minutes of the game. Puskas scored two goals through Zsolt Nagy and Mikael Soisalo.\nFiorentina recovered and turned things around 3-2 through goals from Riccardo Sottil, Lucas Martinez and Moise Kean. However, Puskas was finally able to score the third goal with Wojciech Golla.\n“It was a bad start, that’s clear, and it can’t be explained why. We made mistakes that I didn’t even see in training. I liked the team’s performance in the second half, the approach was good different from us,” said Fiorentina coach Raffaele Palladino of Italian Football.\nFiorentina will visit Puskas Akademia’s headquarters at the Pancho Arena on August 29 for the second leg. The winner of this match will qualify for the 2024/2025 UEFA Conference League group stage.\n[Gambas:Video CNN]\n(hair)\n2024-08-23 01:44:31\n#Gea #Debate #Conceded #Goals #Days #Earning",

    "text": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Wednesday officially declared social media as an 'environmental toxin' and 'public health hazard', putting it in the same category as tobacco and guns. With this, the Big Apple becomes the first city to issue an advisory against social media. Adams further criticized TikTok, YouTube and Facebook, blaming the three platforms for mental health issues in children. His observation is based on latest surveys saying that teen depression levels have hit their highest levels in a decade. In the advisory, the New York mayor added that parents should impose 'tech-free times' for children. The Democrat also urged teens to consider turning off their notifications and tracking their emotions while online.The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also identified unrestricted access to and use of social media as a public health hazard.\"Today, Dr. Ashwin Vasan is issuing a Health Commissioner's Advisory, officially designating social media as a public health hazard in New York City,\" Adams announced during his State of the City address. The advisory cited a 2021 survey stating that on weekdays 77% of New York City high schoolers spent three or more hours per day in front of screens, not including homework. Adams added that the platforms are \"fueling a mental health crisis by designing their platforms with addictive and dangerous features.\"\"We are the first major American city to take this step and call out the danger of social media like this. Just as the surgeon general did with tobacco and guns, we are treating social media like other public health hazards and ensuring that tech companies take responsibility for their products,\" Adams said.",

    "text": "In the heart of modern commerce, a transformative wave is reshaping the landscape of supply chain management. Anchored in the ethos of sustainability, Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices are not just buzzwords but essential strategies for businesses aiming to thrive in an increasingly eco-conscious market. At the forefront of this evolution is the integration of cutting-edge technology and management tools, designed to minimize environmental impact while enhancing operational efficiency. This narrative explores the journey towards a more sustainable future, highlighting the challenges, innovations, and triumphs within the supply chain industry.\nThe Road to Green: Challenges and Innovations\nTransitioning to green logistics is a multifaceted endeavor, encompassing everything from adopting renewable energy sources and electric vehicles to optimizing delivery routes and embracing eco-friendly packaging materials. Companies like Kuehne Nagel are leading the charge, tackling the ambitious goal of decarbonizing road carriers. The logistical giant is not alone in its quest; the UK Government's Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Demonstrator Programme underscores a national commitment to reducing carbon footprints across the freight sector. Yet, the path is fraught with obstacles, including resistance to change, the high costs of green technologies, and the daunting task of supporting SMEs in their transition to low emission vehicles.\nDespite these hurdles, the allure of GSCM practices lies in their promise of long-term benefits. Cost reduction, increased operational efficiency, and improved customer loyalty stand as pillars supporting the business case for sustainability. The integration of AI, IoT, and blockchain technologies within supply chain management software is revolutionizing the field, offering unprecedented levels of traceability and efficiency. These advancements ensure that sustainability is not just a target but an attainable reality, reshaping the future of retail operations and beyond.\nTechnological Frontiers in Green Supply Chain Management\nThe intersection of technology and environmental stewardship is where the future of green logistics is being written. Innovations in AI, Blockchain, IoT, and data analytics are driving efficiency and sustainability in supply chain operations, enabling practices such as fuel-efficient transportation, optimized delivery routes, and ethical green procurement. The role of technology in achieving sustainability goals cannot be understated; it provides the tools necessary to implement eco-friendly practices effectively and at scale. Retailers, under growing pressure to demonstrate their commitment to environmental stewardship, are harnessing these technologies to reduce carbon footprints, minimize waste, and enhance product lifecycle management.\nGelato's supply chain sustainability efforts exemplify the potential benefits of adopting green practices. By focusing on sustainable e-commerce practices, companies can build a positive brand reputation and foster consumer trust, turning sustainability into a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the pursuit of green certifications and the adoption of circular economy practices signal a broader industry trend towards sustainability, promising a greener and more efficient future for supply chain management.\nShaping Tomorrow: The Future of Green Logistics\nThe landscape of supply chain management is on the cusp of a green revolution, influenced by evolving public perceptions and the undeniable benefits of operational efficiency. Emerging trends such as the adoption of renewable energy in warehouses, optimization of fuel efficiency, and the use of IoT devices for resource efficiency are paving the way for a more sustainable industry. The commitment to shifting to electric vehicles and the exploration of circular economy practices further underscore the industry's dedication to environmental stewardship.\nAs businesses navigate the complexities of adopting green practices, the narrative of GSCM practices offers a beacon of hope. It is a testament to the power of innovation, collaboration, and commitment in overcoming the challenges of sustainability. The journey towards green logistics is not just about transforming supply chains but about redefining the very essence of how business is conducted in a world that increasingly values environmental responsibility alongside economic success.\nIn conclusion, the shift towards Green Supply Chain Management practices is reshaping the supply chain industry, promising a future where sustainability and competitiveness go hand in hand. By leveraging technology and embracing eco-friendly practices, companies can reduce environmental impact, improve operational efficiency, and cultivate customer loyalty. As the industry continues to evolve, the commitment to sustainability will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in defining the leaders of tomorrow.",

Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala delivers a speech as part of a joint press statement with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., at Malacanang Palace, in Manila, Philippines, April 17, 2023. Ezra Acayan/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech-led initiative to buy ammunition for Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion has raised enough so far to purchase a first batch of 300,000 artillery shells, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on X social media platform on Friday.\n\"Our goal is to deliver much more!\" he said. \"Our work and our help to Ukraine do not end here. We keep seeking partners so that we can continue to support Ukraine in its brave fight against the Russian aggressor.\"\nCzech President Petr Pavel had said on Thursday the initiative had collected the amount needed for acquiring 800,000 ammunition pieces that had earlier been found and were available from unspecified countries outside Europe.\nA government adviser was Quote: d as saying in Czech media on Thursday evening, after Pavel had spoken of secured financing, that the full purchase was still not covered and there was no target amount in the initiative.\nPavel had last month said 500,000 rounds of 155-calibre ammunition and 300,000 rounds of 122-calibre ammunition were available and could be delivered with secured funding.\nSeveral European Union members and countries outside the bloc have made pledges to the ammunition drive for Ukraine, as fighting against Russia's full-scale invasion hits a third year.\nIt comes as the EU will miss a year-old target to deliver one million ammunition rounds to Ukraine this month and as U.S. military aid, which has been the backbone of international support for Kyiv, has stalled.\nNorway said on Thursday it would donate up to 1.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($153 million) for the Czech plan. That followed pledges by Germany and France this week.\nPavel said on Thursday that 18 countries had joined the initiative.\nUkraine ammunition drive raises enough to buy first 300,000 shells, Czech PM says",

    "text": "Because we all want to hear, ‘Wow, you look great’\nI do my best to eat enough protein, get in my veggies and drink lots of water. I’m all about high-quality supplements, too, for things that are hard to get through good habits alone. I’ve been taking collagen for years, and it’s scientifically proven to improve not just how you look but also how you feel.\nCollagen supports healthy skin, bones, cartilage and joints. Starting in our thirties, it naturally declines and can lead to fine lines, joint stiffness and weaker nails. A\nquality collagen supplement can counteract that. I take it to strengthen my hair, reduce wrinkles and support bone density.\nWhy I trust NativePath collagen\nIt’s a high-quality, fast-absorbing and clean collagen supplement. It contains\njust one ingredient, free from GMOs, fillers, gluten, dairy, sugar and artificial additives.\nPlus, it’s easy to mix into whatever you want — coffee, smoothie, oatmeal, juice or even just water. No clumps or weird aftertaste.\nScience-backed benefits of collagen supplements\nNativePath Collagen is more than a beauty booster (though we love that part). It can support:\n- Increased bone density: Strengthen bones and reduce fracture risk as you age.\n- Cartilage regrowth: Protect and rejuvenate your joints.\n- Wrinkle reduction: Restore skin elasticity for a smoother complexion.\n- Stronger nails and hair: Promote thicker hair and more resilient nails.\n- Improved recovery and gut health: Who doesn’t want that?\nReady to give collagen a try?\nMake collagen a part of your daily routine like I did. Right now, you can get up to 45% off NativePath’s collagen with free shipping when you order through my exclusive link at\ngetnativepath.com/kim.\nTags:\nHealth, NativePath, supplements",
