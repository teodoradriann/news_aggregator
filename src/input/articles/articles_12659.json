    "text": "[ NBA ](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/category/news/) Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga disagrees with the amount of minutes he’s received this season Before the start of the 2023/24 NBA campaign, all eyes in Golden State were on [Jonathan Kuminga](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba/players/jonathan-kuminga/), as he was expected to finally have his breakout season. However, to have breakout performances, you need to be given the opportunity, and so far the young star has been placed mostly on rotation, instead of as a starter for the Warriors. After only being given 23 minutes against the Denver Nuggets on Christmas Day, the 21-year-old expressed his frustrations with the press. During his time on the court, he was able to drop 13 points, win 5 rebounds and handed out two assists in his team’s loss against the reigning champions. “Yeah, I am a difference-maker,” Kuminga expressed. “I know I am. But it’s not up to me to do certain things. How can I say it? It’s not up to me to control my minutes. I feel like I’ve done that. But the last voice ain’t mine. And it’s not easy because I know how to score the basketball. I know how to pass. I know how to do different things on the floor.” Kuminga saying this after dropping 13 points and finishing a -24 even with the Nuggets sleepwalking is wild. [pic.twitter.com/blQMIlR4ZO] — Yeah (@YeahWrld) [December 27, 2023] However, the rising star understands that they are a team with many assets that must fit together.”But it’s about putting all that together. With the people we have on the floor, it’s just tough to put it all together. I’m trying to figure out how to manage that,” he added. Jonathan has known for quite some time that this season will be time for him to either make it or break it in California, as he aspires to become a fundamental part of the Warriors and prove everyone he’s got what it takes to someday dominate the NBA. During the summer he admitted this to ESPN’s Leonard Solms at the Basketball without Borders camp in South Africa, revealing there is a lot of expectation surrounding his performances this current campaign. “This upcoming season is definitely the year,” he said back in August. “A lot of people are expecting so much from me – and myself; I’m expecting a lot. It’s a lot of pressure, but I don’t really pay attention to the noise. The pressure is always going to be there. It’s just [on] me to go out there and perform.” The Warriors coach wasn’t bothered by his player’s remarks and believes they were in good faith Despite what many thought was a direct attack on Steve Kerr, the [Golden State](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba/teams/golden-state-warriors/) coach assured he didn’t interpret Kuminga’s comments as disrespectful towards him. He’s actually convinced that the 21-year-old acted in good faith and simply wants to contribute more to the Bay Area club. After Jonathan expressed his displeasure about Kerr’s rotation, including receiving inconsistent minutes, Kerr responded with ease. “I wasn’t really offended by the comments,” he said. “I think JK meant well. I think it may have come out maybe a little differently than he intended. But it’s all good. We talk every day.” Kerr’s answer came after Wednesday’s team practice, as the Warriors are currently preparing to face the Miami Heat this Thursday at the Chase Center. Golden State are currently sitting in the Western Conference’s 11th spot with a 15-15 record. - [Pistons vs. Celtics Odds, Picks, & Predictions (Dec. 28)](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/pistons-vs-celtics-odds-picks-predictions-dec-28/) - [MVP Joel Embiid isn’t too impressed with Victor Wembanyama: ‘Everything feels a little forced’](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/mvp-joel-embiid-isnt-too-impressed-with-victor-wembanyama-everything-feels-a-little-forced/) - [Pelicans, Smoothie King renew arena naming rights contract](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/pelicans-smoothie-king-renew-arena-naming-rights-contract/) - [NBA Lost Christmas Day Ratings Battle Against NFL For 4th Straight Year](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/nba-lost-christmas-day-ratings-battle-against-nfl-for-4th-straight-year/) - [Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga disagrees with the amount of minutes he’s received this season](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/warriors-forward-jonathan-kuminga-disagrees-with-the-amount-of-minutes-hes-received-this-season/) 1 day ",

    "title": "Post su Schlein, bufera su ex consigliere provinciale Palermo: \"Mi hanno hackerato il profilo\"",
    "text": "(Adnkronos) - \"Non ho mai scritto quel post osceno su Elly Schlein, lo smentisco categoricamente. Mi hanno hackerato il profilo, e non è la prima volta che succede. E' successo altre due volte. Io non ho mai scritto una cosa del genere. In questo momento faccio politica, basandomi sulle sentenze dei giudici, non mi permetterei mai di scrivere una cosa del genere. L'ho scoperto perché mi hanno telefonato e l'ho subito cancellato. Ho anche modificato la privacy del profilo e penso che farò anche una denuncia alla Polizia postale\". Lo ha detto all'Adnkronos Salvo Coppolino, l'ex consigliere provinciale di Palermo di An e ora vicino a Fdi, sul cui profilo è apparso un post contro Elly Schlein. Che ora non c'è più perché cancellato dallo stesso ex politico che oggi lavora all'Ars. \"Ricordo una volta i fascisti volevano abusare di me ma poi fuggirono\", è la frase postata con una immagine di Elly Schlein. Un post condiviso da un altro post. \"Io li chiamai, gli urlai di tornare, di fare di me quello che volevano, che non li avrei denunciati, ma niente, sparirono lasciandomi nel dolore più acuto\", si leggeva nel post. Insorge il Pd. \"Auspichiamo che il ministro Musumeci prenda immediatamente le distanze da Salvo Coppolino, dirigente regionale della lista 'Diventerà bellissima', che lo ha sostenuto nella precedente legislatura alla Presidenza della regione siciliana, che rilancia dal suo account un post contenente offese alla segretaria del partito democratico Elly Schlein. Una vergogna e un gesto indegno che il ministro deve condannare con forza\", dichiara Debora Serracchiani, componente della segreteria nazionale del Pd. “Siamo profondamente indignati per il post vergognoso condiviso da un esponente del movimento di centro destra fondato dal ministro Musumeci, Salvo Coppolino, in cui si associano all’immagine della segretaria Pd Elly Sclein frasi irrispettose e volgari che attraversano un confine morale che non dovrebbe mai essere oltrepassato”, afferma Michele Catanzaro, capogruppo del Pd all’Ars, a nome di tutti i parlamentari del gruppo. “Il post pubblicato da Coppolino - continua - non è solo un attacco personale ma una manifestazione di una cultura che minimizza la gravità della violenza di genere. Il ministro Musumeci prenda pubblicamente le distanze da questo post vergognoso e si unisca alla nostra solidarietà alla segretaria Elly Schlein”. Nello Musumeci dichiara: \"Leggo basito le parole pubblicate sul profilo di Salvo Coppolino, dalle quali l’interessato ha preso le distanze. A prescindere dalla loro reale paternità, sono frasi che condanno fermamente, esprimendo la mia solidarietà alla segretaria Elly Schlein. Spero proprio che uguale sensibilità possa avvertire la sinistra quando sono altri a subire analoghi sciagurati attacchi”.",

    "title": "Canada-Wide Recall Of Swiss Chalet Chicken Nuggets Due To Bone Fragments - The Pinnacle Gazette",
    "text": "A brand of frozen chicken nuggets is under recall across Canada after pieces of bone led to reports of injuries. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced the recall on February 20, 2025, noting, \"The affected product is being recalled from the marketplace due to possible presence of pieces of bone.\" This situation has emerged following multiple consumer complaints about injuries caused by consuming these nuggets.\nThe product involved is Swiss Chalet's frozen chicken breast nuggets, distributed nationwide, and sold in 700-gram boxes. The specific Universal Product Code (UPC) is 066701011479, with best-before dates of September 7, 2025, and September 26, 2025. Images on the packaging reveal nuggets shaped like moons, stars, and planets, making them particularly appealing to children.\nThe CFIA did not specify how many units are affected or details of the reported injuries, only indicating, \"There have been reported injuries associated with the consumption of this product.\" This recall, categorized as Class 2, means there’s a moderate risk of short-term health issues if the product is consumed.\nConsumers are advised to immediately check their freezers for the affected chicken nuggets and to refrain from consuming, serving, or distributing the product. The CFIA states, \"Do not consume, serve, use, sell, or distribute recalled products.\" Anyone who discovers they possess the recalled item should dispose of it or return it to the point of purchase for a refund.\nThe agency is currently conducting a food safety investigation, which could lead to the recall of additional products. \"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products,\" they stated, confirming their commitment to ensuring public safety.\nOlymel, the producer of Swiss Chalet-branded products, has multiple facilities across New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta. The company employs around 12,000 people across its plants, offices, and distribution centers. Its commitment to food safety is being tested as it grapples with this significant recall.\nFor the public's safety, it's recommended to stay informed about potential future recalls and to monitor the CFIA's updates as the investigation progresses. People who have consumed the product and experienced any health issues are urged to contact their healthcare providers.\nIf consumers need more information about the recall, they can reach out to the CFIA via their toll-free number, 1-800-442-2342, or through email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Staying vigilant about food safety is key for protecting families from potentially harmful products.",
