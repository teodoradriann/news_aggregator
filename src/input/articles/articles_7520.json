    "text": "Phuket booze ban begins as election showdown heats up\nThailand’s nationwide alcohol ban kicks in at 6pm today, leaving Phuket tourists dry for 24 hours as the country gears up for the Provincial Administration Organisation (PAO) elections tomorrow, February 1.\nUnder Thai election law, the sale of alcohol is strictly prohibited during voting periods. Those caught flouting the rule face harsh penalties, including fines of up to 10,000 baht, six months in jail, or both. Officials have issued strong warnings ahead of the election, urging compliance.\nMeanwhile, the battle for the presidency of the Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (PPAO) has reached fever pitch. Three candidates are vying for the top seat, but all eyes are on two frontrunners: Lersak Leenanitikul of the People’s Party and former PPAO President Rewat Areerob.\nIn a high-stakes debate at Phuket Rajabhat University last Sunday, January 26 both candidates doubled down on their key policies. Lersak, a former deputy director of Vachira Phuket Hospital, is running under ballot No.2, backed by big names including former Move Forward Party leader Pita Limjaroenrat. His campaign promises include:\n- Overhauling Phuket’s public transport system.\n- Introducing trilingual schools and vocational real-life education.\n- Expanding healthcare with universal cancer screening and 24-hour clinics.\n- Tackling flooding, wastewater issues, and ensuring clean water access.\n- Increasing support for the elderly in need.\nPita hailed Lersak as “the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle” for Phuket’s transformation, highlighting urgent issues like crime, road safety, and healthcare.\nOn the other side, Rewat, running for re-election under ballot No.1, staged a major rally at Phuket Merlin Hotel, promising real change under the slogan: “We do it for real, not selling dreams.” His campaign focuses on:\n- Expanding mass transit and secondary road projects.\n- Strengthening disaster prevention and launching Phuket Alert.\n- Boosting telemedicine, emergency services, and traditional Thai medicine.\n- Promoting AI education and lifelong learning.\n- Advancing environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality.\n- Developing world-class sports facilities and positioning Phuket as a health hub.\n- Supporting local businesses, international festivals, and cultural heritage.\n- Empowering youth through the Next New Gen initiative.\nRewat pointed to his pandemic leadership, citing successful vaccine rollouts, quarantine centres, and economic recovery efforts.\n“We’ve laid the foundations—now let’s take Phuket to the next level.”\nWith tensions high and policies clashing, Phuket voters face a crucial decision tomorrow. The election will determine the island’s future, but for now, residents and tourists alike will have to endure a dry spell as the alcohol ban remains in force until 6pm tomorrow, reported The Phuket News.\nThe Election Commission (EC) warned against alcohol sales and parties today, January 31, until tomorrow, February 1, throughout Thailand, except in Bangkok.\nToday, the EC issued a warning to the public regarding the upcoming election of PAO members and PAO presidents, set to take place tomorrow. From 6pm today, January 31 until 6pm on election day tomorrow, February 1, the sale, distribution, and serving of alcohol are strictly prohibited in all 76 constituencies outside Bangkok.\nViolators of this regulation may face imprisonment and fines.\nLatest Thailand News",

    "text": "Adds detail\nMELBOURNE, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Australia captain Pat Cummins took 10 wickets in a masterclass of clutch bowling to end stout Pakistan resistance and lead his side to a 79-run victory on the fourth day of the second test on Friday, locking up the three-match series 2-0.\nJust when it looked like the match would go down to the wire on the final day, the paceman stepped in to remove Mohammad Rizwan, Pakistan's last recognised batsman, and claim his 250th test wicket.\nCummins (5-49) followed that up with the wicket of Aamer Jamal for a duck to trigger an extra half an hour of play, during which he claimed his fifth wicket of the innings and 10th of the match to help mop up the tail.\nIt was his second 10-wicket match haul in 57 tests and concluded a glorious year in which he led Australia to the World Test Championship, a 50-overs World Cup triumph and the retention of the Ashes in England.\nSet an imposing victory target of 317 runs after bowling Australia out for 262 before lunch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the tourists had put together a series of partnerships that frustrated the potent Australian attack.\nThere were some home nerves when the last substantial stand of 57 between Rizwan (35) and Agha Salman (50) got the target under 100 runs but the match turned for good when Cummins seperated the pair.\nPakistan had threatened to take control of the match on several occasions over the first four days only to let the Australians off the hook.\nFired by an innings of 96 from Mitchell Marsh, Australia had dragged themselves back from 16-4 after lunch on Thursday and resumed on 187-6 on a sunny morning at the MCG.\nWicketkeeper Alex Carey scored 52 to help extend the lead before he was trapped leg before by seamer Mir Hamza (4-32) to bring an end to the innings.\nPakistan were always going to be up against it given the fact that only one team had successfully chased more than 300 runs in the fourth innings in 146 years of test matches at the MCG.\nThe tourists were dismissed for 89 in the fourth innings when Australia won the first test by 360 runs in Perth and the early indications were that Melbourne would witness something similar.\nAbdullah Shafique, whose dropped slip catches in both innings had proved hugely costly to Pakistan, departed for four before lunch when he lunged at a Mitchell Starc delivery and Usman Khawaja took the catch in the cordon.\nCummins trapped Imam-Ul-Haq in front for 12 soon after the resumption but a 61-run partnership between Shan Masood and Babar Azam stalled Australia's progress.\nAgain, Cummins made the breakthrough by inducing Masood into an edge which Steve Smith claimed in the slips with the Pakistan captain on 60.\nAzam continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over but Australia's bowlers remained patient as they targeted the top of his off stump and Josh Hazlewood got the reward when he nipped one back to bowl the Pakistan dangerman for 41.\nPakistan started putting together another partnership but it was worth only 16 runs when Starc (4-55) sent down a delivery that grew big on Saud Shakeel, who top-edged it behind to Carey for 24 with Pakistan still 155 runs from their target.\n(Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney; Editing by Lincoln Feast)\n(( ; +61 403 574 069;))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

    "text": "Do Stanley cups contain lead? Company clears up social media rumors about tumblers There are concerns spreading online about the claim that the very popular Stanley cup tumblers contain lead. The social media reaction prompted Stanley to respond to the claims. \"Our manufacturing process currently employs the use of an industry standard pellet to seal the vacuum insulation at the base of our products; the sealing material includes some lead,\" Stanley wrote in a statement to WRAL News. \"Once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer, making it inaccessible to consumers. \"Rest assured that no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the contents of the product.\" Stanley also said in the \"rare occurrence\" that the base cap of a product comes off and exposes the seal, customers are [eligible for the company's lifetime warranty](https://www.stanley1913.com/pages/contact-warranty). While lead is used in the manufacturing process, the product needs to become damaged to expose it, [a Stanley spokesperson told TODAY.com in a statement](https://www.today.com/health/news/stanley-cups-lead-rcna135513). On the bottom of each cup made by the beverage container powerhouse is a circular barrier made of stainless steel, which covers a pellet that contains lead, the Stanely spokesperson said. The pellet seals the product's vacuum insulation, and it is not accessible unless the stainless-steel barrier comes off — which is possible but “rare,” the Stanley spokesperson notes. “Our engineering and supply chain teams are making progress on innovative, alternative materials for use in the sealing process,” the spokesperson adds. In a [separate statement to NBC affiliate WCNC](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/verify/stanley-cup-lead-health-verify/275-8e52adaf-2825-428f-8830-2543fcf54ec6), the company said all of its products follow all U.S. regulatory requirements. Exposure to lead can seriously harm a child’s health and well-being, [according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/prevention/health-effects.htm). Effects include: - Damage to the brain and nervous system - Slowed growth and development - Learning and behavior problems - Hearing and speech problems This can cause: - Lower IQ - Decreased ability to pay attention - Underperformance in school Dozens of TikTok videos looking for lead in Stanley tumblers have gotten hundreds of thousands of views. A lead poisoning prevention advocate that goes by Lead Safe Mama says she tested several Stanley tumblers sent to her after the protective cover at the bottom came off. In videos from March 2023, she said her tests detected lead. That's now gone viral, and Stanley is trying to calm fears. The only risk of exposure is if the cup is damaged and that protective steel cover on the bottom of the cup comes off, the Stanley spokesperson said. Stanley says this is rare and if it happens, you can submit a claim through the company's lifetime warranty. On the bottom of the Stanley cups, there is a little circular seam. If this nickel-sized plate comes off, that's when the lead would be exposed. Also, Stanley isn't the only tumbler maker that uses lead welds in their cups. The Consumer Product Safety Commission closely watches this exact thing and they have issued recalls when lead in a cup presents a danger. related Trending [ ](/story/patrick-cantlay-takes-off-pga-tour-board-hat-shoots-64-he-trails-thomas-detry-by-1-at-pebble-beach/21264074/) •Credits [Mark Bergin](/rs/bio/20199769/) [Ashley Rowe](/rs/bio/20876417/) [Pritchard Strong](/rs/bio/20215299/)",
