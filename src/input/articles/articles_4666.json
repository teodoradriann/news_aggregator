    "title": "The Golden Opportunity of Dropshipping",
    "text": "The\ne-commerce industry and online shopping have been booming in recent years — this is no secret. Any conversation about the growth of e-commerce and online shopping must also include the growth of dropshipping.\nAccording to the data analysis firm Statista, the e-commerce market is\nexpected to reach US$7.4 trillion in the next four years. Statista also forecasts that the overall market value of dropshipping will grow to US$476.1 billion by 2026.\nTo learn more about what dropshipping is exactly today and the potential of this fast-growing e-commerce segment, we recently spoke with Lior Pozin, the co-founder and CEO of dropshipping platform provider\nAutoDS.\n“E-commerce is currently in its prime, and there is now a golden opportunity for dropshippers to leverage the boom in online shopping, mostly thanks to automation tools, to scale their businesses and increase profits,” said Pozin.\nWhat Is Dropshipping?\nDropshipping is an e-commerce business model in which sellers do not keep products in stock. Instead, the sellers work directly with suppliers. When a customer places an order, the dropshipper then purchases the item from a third-party supplier, who in turn sends the product directly to the customer.\nFor example, a dropshipper could sell an item for $150 from a supplier that has priced the product at $100. From this sale, the dropshipper earns a solid profit of $50.\n“In dropshipping, the seller is acting as a middleman in the order fulfillment process,” explained Pozin.\nSince the dropshipping model does not require sellers to stock inventory, e-commerce entrepreneurs can get involved in dropshipping and launch online stores with limited upfront capital investments.\n“The dropshipping business model can be described as low-risk and high-reward, opening the door for dropshippers to make attractive profits with minimal investments,” added Pozin.\nDifferences Between Dropshipping and E-commerce\nInventory is the main difference between the new dropshipping and traditional e-commerce models. In a standard e-commerce model, sellers must purchase and store stock, which comes with significant expenses and ongoing risks. However, in the dropshipping model, the sellers work directly with the suppliers.\n“In fact, dropshipping has evolved into an easier and hassle-free way of selling online,” stated Pozin.\nHe notes that dropshipping allows sellers to market as many different products as possible and expand their product catalogs. This is because dropshippers do not need to invest in inventory.\n“Consequently, dropshippers can cater to different demands and a larger market,” said Pozin.\nAccording to him, this makes the dropshipping business model easily scalable, allowing sellers to test and list more items easily. Without investing in the inventory, scaling a dropshipping business comes at less risk.\n“The best way to scale a dropshipping business is with automation tools. Automation in dropping allows sellers to use marketing and customer service to increase sales,” recommended Poizin.\nHow to Start a Dropshipping Business\nAccording to AutoDS,\nstarting a dropshipping business is not as complex as it may sound. The company recommends following a few general steps to ensure that dropshippers offer attractive products in an optimized store targeted at the correct audience:\n- Step 1: Find sellable products\n- Step 2: Choose suppliers\n- Step 3: Select a selling platform\n- Step 4: Import products to your store\n- Step 5: Market your products\n- Step 6: Manage order fulfillment\n- Step 7: Provide excellent customer service\n- Step 8: Automate your business for better success\nA dropshipping business is full of ongoing, time-consuming processes and tasks. From spending hours finding the best products to sell to processing fulfillment orders, managing a\ndropshipping business manually can be a laborious endeavor full of room for human error.\nPozin highlights that fully understanding the dropshipping model and how the processes work is key to running a successful dropshipping business. He further notes that access to product information and selling tools are required to generate significant profits.\n“Dropshipping automation tools allow sellers to automate the entire dropshipping process. Automation allows dropshippers to save valuable time and reduce errors in any of the steps. Plus, by automating dropshipping processes, sellers can optimize their businesses and boost profits,” concluded Pozin.",

    "title": "Un aniversario sin Putin: Cómo el acto por el \"Día D\" se convirtió en una advertencia de Occidente a Rusia",
    "text": "El 80º aniversario del desembarco de Normandía se convirtió en una advertencia a Rusia y a cualquier \"poder oscuro\" de que las democracias occidentales están unidas y dispuestas a defender su libertad igual que en 1944.\nLa habitual congregación de jefes de Estado y de Gobierno occidentales, unos 25 en esta ocasión, quiso ser una demostración de unidad y fortaleza ante el retorno de una guerra de agresión, la de Ucrania, al continente europeo por primera vez desde 1945. A diferencia de 2004 y 2014, esta vez el Mandatario ruso, Vladimir Putin, no fue invitado .\nde-Normandia.html\"No podemos plegarnos ante los dictadores\", advirtió tajantemente el Presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden , en la ceremonia estadounidense en el cementerio de Colleville sur Mer, donde manifestó que \"la democracia está más amenazada que nunca\".\nBiden trazó un paralelismo entre el pasado y el apoyo internacional a Ucrania y dejó clara la postura de su país: \"No daremos la espalda a Ucrania. Si le damos la espalda, Ucrania caerá bajo el yugo ruso y luego Europa también caerá \".\nMacron: \"No flaquearemos\" en el apoyo a Ucrania\n\"Gracias al pueblo ucraniano por su valentía, por su amor a la libertad. Estamos aquí y no flaquearemos\", afirmó por su parte el Presidente francés y anfitrión, Emmanuel Macron , en la ceremonia internacional en la vecina localidad de Saint Laurent sur Mer, ambas en la playa de Omaha.\nEn una intervención ante 25 líderes internacionales, entre ellos el Presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski , Macron pidió: \"ante todos los que quieren cambiar las fronteras por la fuerza para reescribir la historia (...) seamos dignos de los que desembarcaron aquí \".\nTambién advirtió contra \"la anestesia y la amnesia que duermen las conciencias\" sobre los hechos del pasado y su posible repetición, y proclamó: \"por eso estamos aquí este día. Sabemos que la libertad es un combate de cada día\".\nLa asistencia de Zelenski y la no invitación a Rusia por parte de Francia, país organizador de la ceremonia internacional, ya evidenció que este aniversario no sería como los anteriores y que más que una celebración de la paz lograda en 1945 sería una advertencia contra los peligros que la acechan.\nBiden advierte contra el aislacionismo\nJoe Biden , con un claro punto electoral interno, recordó la situación de su país antes de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y la de ahora, con su rival electoral, Donald Trump , que defiende una postura menos intervencionista en el exterior.\n\"Hay poderes oscuros, como siempre. Vemos un ejemplo claro en Ucrania, que lucha contra una tiranía que quiere dominarla \", advirtió.\n\"El aislacionismo no es la respuesta. No era la respuesta hace 80 años y no lo es ahora\", aseguró el Presidente estadounidense, quien insistió en que la OTAN, reforzada con el reciente ingreso de Suecia y Finlandia, \"está más unida que nunca\".\nMacron, como anfitrión, estuvo siempre al lado de Biden, tanto en la ceremonia estadounidense, como en la internacional y entre ambas condecoró con la Legión de Honor a 14 veteranos de la campaña de Normandía.\nLas dos principales ceremonias tuvieron lugar en distintos puntos de la playa Omaha , llamada \"la sangrienta\" por el elevado número de bajas que sufrieron las unidades estadounidenses que desembarcaron allí, y uno de los cinco puntos en que llegaron los aliados por mar hace 80 años, junto con las de Utah, Gold, Juno y Sword .\nEsta playa y el cementerio militar estadounidense situado sobre ella, con 9.338 tumbas de soldados caídos , se trata, según definió Macron, \"de uno de los lugares más conmovedores de Francia\".\nLos más de 156.000 soldados aliados que llegaron el 6 de junio de 1944 por mar y por aire traían \"una visión del hombre digno y libre\" y \"sabían que era una guerra justa\", recordó el Presidente francés.\nLa presencia de 15 buques militares de países de la OTAN en las aguas próximas y el sobrevuelo de aviones de combate y transporte, también de varios países de la Alianza, evidenció de forma simbólica la unidad actual de la organización.\nLas ceremonias de este año han contado con la presencia de algunos de los veteranos de esa batalla que quedan vivos , sobre todo estadounidenses, unos 200, en el que puede ser el último aniversario importante al que acudan debido a su edad (todos rondan o superan los 100 años).\nPor ello, fueron los protagonistas de numerosos homenajes y Macron condecoró a un total de 14 de ellos, todos estadounidenses, con la Legión de Honor en los dos principales eventos.",

    "text": "By Svitlana Vlasova, CNN Kyiv (CNN) — Most of the men in Oksana Rubanyak’s platoon are at least 10 years older than her. Before the war, having a young woman in charge of an all-male Ukrainian military unit might have given the troops pause. But as the platoon prepares for a frontline deployment at a time Ukraine is desperately trying to hold off Russian advances, things like gender and age no longer matter that much, Rubanyak said. It’s a huge change compared to when she first joined the army two years ago. “Women are recognized, women are promoted to combat positions, to officer positions. These are no longer just medical or headquarters roles,” she told CNN in a phone interview. Female soldiers are now participating in assaults, she said. “And I am very happy about it.” The number of women in the military has increased significantly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with more than 62,000 women currently serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, according to official statistics. More than 5,000 are serving in the combat zone, like Rubanyak, who is now 21. Rubanyak was 19 when she joined the Ukrainian army as a volunteer. She served near Bakhmut and was, as now, the only woman in her platoon. She operated a heavy machine gun and, while she did everything the men did, she said she experienced some level of bias – such as some men trying to stop her from carrying heavy weapons. “I heard people saying behind my back that I must be someone’s daughter, that my father would promote me and so on. It was something new for many people. Everyone was trying to find a catch, that just didn’t exist,” she said. And while she said that there have been many positive changes in the past two years, there is still work to do. “Everything takes time,” she said. “Although all the conditions for women to serve in the army are there now, if they choose to.” Working two jobs As more and more Ukrainians join the war effort, the country’s women are increasingly stepping in – and not just in the military. The Ukrainian government doesn’t disclose how many people have signed up to the armed forces in the last two years. However, it’s clear that hundreds of thousands have swapped their day jobs for military service. With new waves of military conscription expected soon, employers are facing a new problem: how to fill the vacancies left by the men drafted. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of women have left the country, seeking refuge abroad. According to the National Bank of Ukraine, employers nationwide are currently facing a shortage of about 60,000 skilled workers, an increase of some 20,000 since 2021. With so many unfilled vacancies, women are often picking up the slack. A number of Ukrainian organizations and companies are offering training courses for women for some of the jobs conventionally thought of as male roles. Halyna Shevchenko knows this firsthand. She works in a repair department of the Ukrainian Railways in the Poltava region. Before the war, she managed a team of 10 men who repaired complex parts of railway cars. When two of her colleagues were mobilized, the company couldn’t find anyone to fill their specialized positions. So, Shevchenko started to learn the technical skills and now does some of the repairs herself. With women making up 40% of Ukrainian Railways’ employees, she is likely not the only one. “We have some tasks where male colleagues prepare everything for me as much as possible, and then I do them because the men need help. Before the war, I had never done this on my own, I only supervised the process,” she told CNN. The new tasks – and the war – have significantly increased her workload. The Ukrainian Railways told CNN that 10,200 of their 190,000 employees have been mobilized, with 600 having been killed in the war since the beginning of the war. At the same time, the railways have become the vital arteries of Ukraine since Russia’s attacks have halted passenger air travel and severely limited shipping through the Black Sea . The railways have carried more than 40 million passengers and huge amounts of cargo since the war began. The company has also introduced all sorts of new, military-focused services, including evacuation trains for wounded soldiers. All of that means that Shevchenko’s team has to carry out more repairs. “I am a techie, just like my colleagues. That’s why we communicate with the guys on an equal footing. We complement each other and consult on complex repairs,” she said. War and the economy Kernel, one of Ukraine’s largest agricultural producers and exporters, has also started to look for solutions to the worker shortages. “There is a shortage of both women and men in the labor market. We have lowered the requirements for candidates and introduced basic training programs where a person can learn to become a laboratory assistant or a (machine) operator from scratch,” Natalia Teryakhina, Kernel’s HR director, told CNN. The company has also started training women to be boiler operators – a job women didn’t tend to do before the war. “We piloted this project… to prove that women can work in conventionally male occupations. It was a successful experiment, and all the women continue to work,” she said. Shevchenko said she is determined to keep doing the “man’s job” of fixing railway cars for as long as is needed. She has built up a good rapport with her team and said she feels respected by them. “As long as I have enough health and strength, I will do everything to help my colleagues as much as possible – until the end, until we win,” she said.
