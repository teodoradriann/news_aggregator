    "title": "Picking Up The Pieces: Ministry Founder Stays Positive, Even After Devastating Fire",
    "text": "Thursday, December 28th 2023, 3:40 pm A fire in Southwest Oklahoma City leaves a ministry without an operational building. News 9 spoke with the director of Grace United Urban Ministries, and some volunteers as they worked to clean up the debris, and salvage what they could from the fire. “We gotta keep moving because we have people depending on us, and we save lives - that's what we do,” said Donna Heins. Donna Heins runs Grace United Urban Ministries in south Oklahoma City, which provides services for those facing homelessness. She does what she can to help those living on the streets. “God, we have to figure out how we still feed people- that's just what I thought, even in this devastation,” said Heins. They serve around 40 people most days, but between their Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, they fed more than 700 people in need. “There's some good people on the street - and we're all just a paycheck away these days and times from being homeless,” said Heins. But her mission was interrupted last night when her building caught on fire. Oklahoma City firefighters responded around 6 p.m. on Wednesday, after the apartment above the ministry caught fire. The building that housed Grace United mostly just suffered water and smoke damage, but Heins says there was too much damage to save the building. But Donna's first thought wasn't fear or panic when she heard about the fire. She was immediately thinking about how she would continue her mission, even with the interruption. “I always know that God makes a way out of no way. I've seen it my whole life and that's how I tell my homeless people, you may be here today, but tomorrow if you make the right decision, you could be in a different place,” said Heins. Some of the people that Donna has helped through the years were at the building this morning to help clean up the damage and debris. “I've been on the streets for like 20 years and about a year ago she asked me to get off the street, I've been helping her ever since then,” said William Beaver. Beaver was moved into temporary housing after he decided he no longer wanted to live a life on the streets. “Last year when we did the emergency shelter, he said ‘I don't wanna go back to the street’ and I said, ‘Well come on home with us Beaver!’” said Heins “He's doing amazing, we're reuniting him with his mom and his family so he came to help today.” Now Beaver is returning the favor, helping Donna, like she helped him. “That's what it's all about, watching people change and do something different with their life,” said Heins. While there’s not much left for them to salvage, Donna says they will keep moving forward. “All I know is God is always with us, he has a plan,” said Heins. “We made it through the holidays, now we just gotta make it through the new year and it's just gonna be another adventure.” Oklahoma City firefighters are still working to determine the cause of the fire, but they do say it started in the apartment upstairs, above the building, and they say luckily nobody was hurt. Heins says they are now looking for a new building to rent, and she is hoping to stay in the Southwest OKC / Capitol Hill area.

    "text": "28 Dec 2023 | 09:31 PM UTC US: Large waves and coastal flooding likely to impact parts of West Coast and Hawaii through Dec. 31 Large waves, coastal flooding likely to impact parts of West Coast of contiguous US and Hawaii through Dec. 31; officials order evacuations. Large waves and coastal flooding are forecast to impact parts of the West Coast of the contiguous US and Hawaii through at least Dec. 31. Coastal flooding had already been reported in some areas along the California coast as of Dec. 28, and authorities accordingly called on residents to evacuate some coastal areas in Marin County and Santa Cruz County. In Marin County, officials ordered residents in the Stinson Beach area to evacuate, including those in Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera, and Embarcadero, as well as parts of Calle del Arroyo. In Santa Cruz County, authorities issued evacuation warnings for Capitola Village, the Pajaro Dunes area, and coastal areas near Seacliff State Beach. The coastal flooding has also prompted officials to close some roads in affected areas, including in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County. Transport disruptions are likely in areas that are subject to road closures. Coastal flooding may impact other communities along the West Coast and in Hawaii over the coming days and prompt local authorities to issue additional evacuation orders and road closures. As of around 13:15 PST Dec. 28, the US National Weather Service had issued the following coastal flood and high surf warnings and advisories for the West Coast of the contiguous US and Hawaii: California Coastal Flood Warning: Coastal North Bay, including Point Reyes National Seashore; Northern Monterey Bay; San Francisco; San Francisco Peninsula coast; Southern Monterey Bay; Big Sur coast; San Luis Obispo County beaches; Santa Barbara County Central Coast beaches; Ventura County beaches Coastal Flood Advisory: Catalina and Santa Barbara islands; Los Angeles County beaches; Malibu coast; Santa Barbara County southeastern and southwestern coasts; San Diego County coastal areas; Orange County coastal areas High Surf Warning: Coastal Del Norte County; Mendocino County coast; southwestern and northern Humboldt County coasts; coastal North Bay, including Point Reyes National Seashore; northern Monterey Bay; San Francisco; San Francisco Peninsula coast; southern Monterey Bay; Big Sur coast; San Luis Obispo County beaches; Santa Barbara County Central Coast beaches; Ventura County beaches; San Diego County coastal areas High Surf Advisory: Catalina and Santa Barbara islands; Los Angeles County beaches; Malibu coast; Santa Barbara County southeastern and southwestern coasts; Orange County coastal areas Hawaii High Surf Warning: Kauai North; Maui Central Valley North; Maui Windward West; Molokai North; Molokai West; Molokai Windward; Niihau; Oahu North Shore; Waianae Coast; Windward Haleakala Oregon High Surf Warning: Curry County coast; south-central Oregon coast High Surf Advisory: Central Oregon coast; north Oregon coast Washington High Surf Advisory: Central Coast; North Coast; south Washington coast Authorities may extend, rescind, or otherwise modify the weather warnings and advisories over the coming days. Flooding is particularly likely in low-lying communities in coastal areas and coastal communities with easily overwhelmed drainage systems. Disruptions to electricity, water supply, and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding impacts utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows may render additional bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close further low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are likely in areas that experience track inundation. Flight disruptions, including delays and cancellations, may impact airports in coastal areas that experience flooding. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, evacuations, or some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before travel. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where flooding is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions in affected areas. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

Jerusalem, March 9 Israel has said that it \"welcomed\" the inauguration of the maritime corridor from Cyprus to the Gaza Strip aimed at boosting the humanitarian aid to the embattled Palestinian enclave. \"The Cypriot initiative will allow the increase of humanitarian aid to Gaza,\" Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lior Haiat said on Friday in a statement, without specifying the time frame for the arrival of the first shipment, Xinhua news agency reported. Haiat noted that Israel will control the entry of aid into Gaza by \"conducting security checks in accordance with Israeli standards\". During a visit to the Cypriot port of Larnaca, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday that it is hopeful that the maritime corridor for providing humanitarian aid to Gaza would open this Sunday, according to a press release by the Cypriot Interior Ministry. The EU Chief noted that an initial pilot operation will be launched on Friday for the maritime corridor initiated by Cyprus, the EU, the UAE, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain, and the US. The delivery of aid to Gaza is of critical urgency as the humanitarian crisis in the enclave has been worsening since Israel launched a large-scale offensive in Gaza to retaliate against a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 last year. The Israeli offensive has so far killed more than 30,800 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. --IANS Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor [Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/international/israel-welcomes-maritime-aid-corridor-from-cyprus-to-gaza-spokesperson/)",

    "text": "3 weeks ago\nHello, I just recently purchase Google Chromecast but when I open the Netflix app it shows Error Code: ui-800-3 any fix for this?\nI already tried reinstalling netflix. Turning off and on Chromecast.\nAnswered!\n[Go to the Recommended Answer.](/t5/Streaming/Netflix-Error-Code-ui-800-3/m-p/653957#M58457)\na week ago\nHey all,\nApologies for the delay - here's the latest: the team has identified a root cause and are working toward rolling out a fix. I don't have a timeline to communicate at this time, but I'll keep you updated as I hear more.\nThank you,\nKélan\n3 weeks ago\n[@Ashepherdson](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/834) : and the strange thing is , i am getting the same error when i try to cast netflix through my phone or ipad as well.\n3 weeks ago\nThat makes sense. On the CCwGTV Netflix treats it as a streaming device , so casting just runs through the app rather than traditional casting as it would be on a regular Chromecast. So if the app isn't working properly then casting wouldn't work either.\nAs the other user has said, if in fact this is some sort of software issue, the best bet would be to contact Google support. I will escalate this and see if anyone can address it.\n3 weeks ago\nYes, I did contact Google Support, they are saying its Netflix issue and not Chromecast issue, and Netflix customer support is saying its a hardware issue, not their issue.\n3 weeks ago\nSo standard tech support run around.. that sucks.\nIf you don't have any network settings blocking the connection (say custom DNS on your router or device), and you have tried signing out of Netflix then signing back in, I have already escalated so we will have to wait for either Google or Netflix to respond.\n3 weeks ago\nThis is a Google problem, not a Netflix problem, and you should be very clear about this, so just contact Google.\n3 weeks ago\nI urge you to report and urge this problem as soon as possible. This problem occurred after pushing the STTL.240812.006 version system. Previous versions will not cause this problem. MFG 2020 and 2021 have this problem. I saw some netizens report that 01/2022 also has this problem, but I tried 04/2022 and it doesn't have this problem, because different MFG time, the factory system version is different.\n3 weeks ago\nI mean a newly opened google tv 4k produced in 2020, not the device you have been using for the past few years. Because the newly opened device must be updated to the latest system when it is set up for the first time, and the latest system version is STTL.240812.006. The first time you open the device and update it to this version, this problem will occur. The device you have been using, based on the existing system, will not have Netflix errors if it is updated to the current latest system. I have compared myself, because I have several google tv 4k, I don’t know if I have described this problem accurately.\n3 weeks ago\nsame error，unless Google fixes this bug through a system update\n3 weeks ago\nhope that Google's software team can investigate and solve this problem as soon as possible. It has seriously affected the use of Netflix to watch streaming movies and TV shows. Thank you.\n3 weeks ago\nHello Kelan,\nAny update on this please.\n2 weeks ago\nFollowing up on this issue?\n2 weeks ago - last edited 2 weeks ago\nHello kelan any update from Google on this please..\na week ago\nHey all,\nApologies for the delay - here's the latest: the team has identified a root cause and are working toward rolling out a fix. I don't have a timeline to communicate at this time, but I'll keep you updated as I hear more.\nThank you,\nKélan\na week ago\nThank you so much Kelan Will just wait for the fix hopefully soon\nyesterday\nHello, i'm from argentina, 1 month ago i bought one Chromecast 4 k and has the same problem, but today i bought another one (same date producted, same model and color) and netflix is working fine. What i saw configuring both devices is that both have diferences like diferent screens for selecting language or configuring the remote controlar, it's like both have diferent version of operative system\nyesterday\nGoogle Support reached out to me. They said they deployed a fix. I can confirm it is working now.\nI am uncertain how the fix was deployed. My Chromecast About doesn't show any new updates installed since the last time I confirmed it not working. My Netflix app is version 11.0.8 build 19823, which looks like was released Oct 24th -- but I didn't check if this is different than version when it wasn't working. So maybe the fix was in a Netflix app update? Or maybe it was something server side?\n2 hours ago\nMy \"Chromecast with Google TV (4K)\" has the same release and build numbers but I'm still getting the error message. Did a factory reset again as well to see if that would help but still nothing.. wonder if this fix is being released in phases?",

    "text": "The state is celebrating the saltwater bivalve all of October, which the governor has proclaimed as North Carolina Oyster Month. Photo: Justin Kase Conder/courtesy NC Oyster Trail From oyster farm tours to seafood festivals, North Carolina is ready to “shellebrate” Oyster Month.\nOysters are more than just the centerpiece of a get-together, these bivalves improve water quality while filtering saltwater for food, protect and help restore shorelines, offer refuge for marine animals, and are packed with nutrients.\nOrganized by the North Carolina Sea Grant, North Carolina Coastal Federation, North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and the NC Oyster Trail, a tourism and promotion campaign, this is the fourth year the state has celebrated the ecologically and economically important mollusks.\nJane Harrison, a coastal economist with Sea Grant, told Coastal Review that North Carolina Oyster Month began in 2023. “We had been shellebrating NC Oyster Week in October since 2020, but expanded it last year because folks wanted to host events all month long.”\nThe purpose of setting aside the entire month to promote awareness of the state’s oysters is to highlight “the wonder of N.C. oysters and raise their profile,” Harrison continued. “We inform folks on where you can eat them, their role in the ecosystem, how we ensure a sustainable seafood supply, and opportunities to protect our treasured coastal environment.”\nShe said the Oyster Month events are “a blast,” and encourages attending as many “as you can.”\nThe state has recognized October as North Carolina Oyster Month, as well.\n“North Carolina is home to a valuable and productive coastal ecosystem with many champions who work together to protect it and the keystone species that benefit the state’s marine and coastal environments with food provision, water filtering capacity, and fish habitat,” begins the proclamation Gov. Roy Cooper’s office released Tuesday.\nNorth Carolina has taken action to promote and protect the oyster and the industry that depends on it.\nThe state has been working to restore and protect oysters since 1915, resulting in the creation of thousands of acres of harvestable reefs and nearly 400 acres of oyster sanctuary in the Pamlico Sound. The General Assembly commissioned in 2018 the “North Carolina Strategic Plan for Shellfish Mariculture: A Vision to 2030.” That same year, North Carolina became the first in the Southeast and sixth in the nation to join the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Shellfish Initiative and launch the N.C. Shellfish Initiative, according to the proclamation.\nTwo years later, the NC Oyster Trail was launched, an effort of the Coastal Federation, Sea Grant and North Carolina Shellfish Growers Association to promote oysters, and the “Oyster Restoration and Protection Plan for North Carolina: A Blueprint for Action” was released, now in its fourth edition.\nCoastal Federation Oyster Program Director Erin Fleckenstein leads the blueprint effort.\nFleckenstein explained that the nonprofit plans to participate in many of the events scheduled this month, and expects to launch an outreach campaign. Those following the organization’s social media will be able to catch a video series with different “how-to” topics such as how to recycle shells, create the perfect wine and oyster pairing, and shuck an oyster.\nFleckenstein noted that during the month-long celebration and with the start of wild harvest season, a lot of empty oyster shells will be produced. It’s critical to make sure these shells are properly recycled so they can be used to create more oyster reefs.\nThe nonprofit has worked with government and community partners to provide a few dozen places coastwide for oyster lovers to drop off shells for recycling. Find the locations are listed on the organization’s website, nccoast.org/shellrecycling .\n“We discourage using shells for anything other than building new oyster reefs,” Fleckenstein said. “Shells make a great substrate for new oysters to grow on. Currently, we don’t have enough shells to build all the reefs we want to. Oyster lovers can help ensure more oysters in the future by recycling their shells.”\nJoin the conversation on social media with #NCOysterMonth, #NCOysters, #GiveAShuck, and #KeepShuckin.\nNC Oyster Trail provided the following schedule of events:\nOyster Roast at Dune Street Raw Bar & Grill in Nags Head 3-11 p.m. Friday.

In updated American recommendations for the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), bleeding reduction strategies on antiplatelet therapy are embraced, as are non-statin lipid-lowering therapies for secondary prevention.\nThe newly released 2025 ACS guideline from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association still have default dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) as a Class I recommendation, the standard being at least 12 months of it after hospital discharge for patients with low bleeding risk.\nHowever, the guideline, published jointly in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and Circulation , also lays out more bleed-safe alternatives to the standard DAPT regimen for people with unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI):\nSelected patients can transition from DAPT to ticagrelor (Brilinta) monotherapy a month or later after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; Class I) A proton pump inhibitor can be added for those at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (Class I) De-escalation of DAPT from ticagrelor or prasugrel (Effient) to clopidogrel (Plavix) may be reasonable at least a month after PCI (Class IIb) Those at high bleeding risk can transition to single antiplatelet therapy (either aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor) after 1 month (Class IIb) These are major changes since the last DAPT guideline, from 2016 , which had only mentioned shorter-duration DAPT as a consideration for ACS patients at lower ischemic risk with high bleeding risk (Class IIb).\n\"Patients with ACS are at the highest risk for cardiovascular complications both acutely and chronically, which emphasizes the importance of staying up-to-date on the most recent evidence presented in this guideline,\" said guideline writing committee chair Sunil Rao, MD, of NYU Langone Health in New York City, in a press release. \"With appropriate management, we can improve outcomes both in the hospital and over the long term.\"\nThe new guideline also introduces non-statin lipid-lowering therapies -- such as ezetimibe (Zetia), evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent), inclisiran (Leqvio), and bempedoic acid (Nexletol) -- for secondary prevention in ACS survivors.\nStatin users with an LDL cholesterol ≥70 mg/dL are strongly urged to take a concurrent non-statin lipid-lowering agent to further reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (Class I), while those with LDL cholesterol at 55-69 mg/dL, already on a maximally tolerated statin, may reasonably add one of these therapies to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (Class IIa).\nAll ACS patients starting or adjusting a dose of lipid-lowering therapy should have a fasting lipid panel taken 4-8 weeks later to gauge response or additional medications that may be needed (Class I).\nAnother important aspect of secondary prevention is referral to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation prior to hospital discharge, which is strongly endorsed to reduce death, myocardial infarction, and hospital readmissions and improve functional status and quality of life (Class I).\nHome-based cardiac rehabilitation is deemed a reasonable alternative (Class IIa), but more research is needed to see whether this model provides the same benefit as facility-based programs and makes good on its promise of better adherence, according to Rao's group.\nThe 2025 guideline also now has intravascular imaging (intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography) as a class I recommendation to guide PCI.\nFinally, patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock may receive a microaxial flow pump with careful attention paid to vascular access and the weaning of support (Class IIa).\nThe new ACS guideline was written in collaboration with and endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians, the National Association of EMS Physicians, and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions.\nGuideline writers acknowledged unanswered questions in this setting, including the potential role of GLP-1 receptor agonists and colchicine after ACS.",
