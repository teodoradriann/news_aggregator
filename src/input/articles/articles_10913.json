    "text": "Photo: Mark Makela / Getty Images News / Getty Images\nRepublicans are demanding the White House turn over documents about Hunter Biden as part of their impeachment probe into his father, President Joe Biden .\nHouse Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan sent a letter to the White House asking for \"documents and communications sent or received by employees of the Executive Office of the President regarding the deposition of Hunter Biden\" and any records \"sent or received by employees of the Executive Office of the President regarding President Biden's statement about his family's business associates on December 6, 2023.\"\nThe Republicans want to know if Joe Biden had any input on his son's decision to ignore a subpoena that required him to testify behind closed doors as part of the impeachment probe.\nWhile Hunter refused to testify privately, he offered to provide public testimony to Congress.\n\"The Committees have accumulated substantial evidence that Hunter Biden's business endeavors have improperly included his father, and the President has made false claims about his knowledge and involvement in these schemes. In fact, just days before Mr. Biden was scheduled to appear for his deposition, the President claimed he had not interacted with any of his son's business partners. This is false. The President has met with, spoken to, and received money sourced from his son's foreign business partners,\" Comer and Jordan said in a joint statement .",

    "text": " News | Economy & Labor More Than Half of Americans Don’t Have Enough Savings to Cover $1,000 Expense More than one in five Americans have no emergency savings fund set up at all.\nBy Chris Walker , T ruthout Published January 25, 2024 Jake Allen via Unsplash A new survey highlights how most Americans would be unable to use their savings in order to pay for an unexpected expense.\nWhile the poll from Bankrate acknowledged the country’s falling inflation numbers and strong employment trends, it added that “many Americans still don’t have enough savings for a rainy day.”\nThe annual survey, which Bankrate has conducted for the past 13 years, notes that only 44 percent of Americans could pay for a $1,000 emergency through a savings fund they are currently maintaining. The remaining 56 percent of Americans would have to take other actions, with more than a third saying they would be forced to go deeper into debt.\nSixteen percent of Americans would reduce their spending habits elsewhere in order to cover the cost of an emergency, the survey found, while 35 percent would have to borrow money to pay for it, either through taking out a personal loan, paying through credit cards or asking family members or friends for aid. Five percent said they’d “do something else,” an answer which Bankrate didn’t delve into.\nThe survey also found that 57 percent of Americans are uncomfortable with the amount of savings they have for emergencies. Twenty-two percent of Americans have no emergency fund set up at all — the second lowest rate in Bankrate’s history of polling on the question.\nRelated Story News | Economy & Labor Greedflation Accounts for 53 Cents of Every Dollar of Inflation in Past 6 Months With the 2024 presidential election looming, 96 percent of Americans say inflation is an important issue to them. By Chris Walker , T ruthout January 22, 2024 Truthout The U.S. has been experiencing numerous positive economic indicators as of late , including low unemployment, a reduction in inflation and continued economic growth over the past year. On Thursday, the Commerce Department announced that the gross domestic product grew by 3.3 percent in the past year .\nHowever, those economic gains aren’t being felt in households across the country, as inflation has raised the costs of goods to the point where most Americans say they are living paycheck-to-paycheck .\nThe issue is likely to play a major role in the 2024 presidential election. Typically, incumbent presidents are viewed as more vulnerable when the economy isn’t doing well . The fact that most Americans aren’t experiencing the effects of positive economic indicators firsthand could be problematic for President Joe Biden, who is seeking reelection in the fall.\nPolling data on the question is indeed alarming for Biden. According to an Economist /YouGov poll published this week , 19 out of 20 registered voters (95 percent) view inflation and rising prices as an important issue. Those voters also gave Biden failing marks on the matter — just 37 percent of registered voters approve of Biden when it comes to inflation and prices, while 58 percent disapprove.",

    "title": "The Cancer-Fighting Vegetable That Can Also Boost Your Kidney Health",
    "text": "Is there really an affordable, easily available food that fights cancer as well as protects your kidneys? Yes! It's arugula, a leafy green that's full of flavor and bursting with nutrients. You've probably seen bagged arugula or arugula in bunches in your nearest grocery store's produce aisle. Like other leafy greens, it contains a long list of vitamins and minerals. Among the most important nutrients in arugula for helping to fight against cancer and kidney problems are high levels of glucosinolates and low levels of potassium, said Kathleen Benson , a Registered Dietician with Top Coaching Nutrition, in an exclusive interview with Health Digest. What are glucosinolates? Benson explained that they're compounds that have been linked to cancer-fighting effects. Specifically, she said that glucosinolates protect against DNA damage and promote apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells. Although she admitted that the evidence isn't strong enough yet to confirm that glucosinolates significantly lower cancer risk in humans, she's a big supporter of adding arugula into the diet as part of a wider, lifestyle-based cancer prevention diet. Arugula helps prevent cancer (at least theoretically) Benson's not alone in her appreciation of arugula for its potential anti-cancer benefits. A 2022 article from the National Cancer Institute suggests that adding cruciferous vegetables (including arugula) into the diet makes sense, though their relationship to a lowered cancer risk in humans hasn't been fully established. Like Benson, Natalie Rizzo, a registered dietitian writing for Today , maintains a hopeful but realistic mindset when it comes to the connection between arugula and a lowered incidence of cancer. Rizzo writes, \"[A]nimal studies do not always translate human results and more research is necessary to know the full impact of these plant compounds on human health.\" Does this mean you have to be wary and wait until more experiments are published? Nope. After all, arugula offers other nutritional advantages . As Medical News Today reports, arugula is rich in vitamin K , vitamin C, and calcium. Consequently, it can be part of an overall healthier diet, which the Cleveland Clinic acknowledges can be an ally if you're trying to keep your risk of cancer as low as possible. Developing a taste for kidney-friendly arugula In terms of protecting against kidney problems like chronic kidney disease (CKD), arugula's lower potassium makes it a potential winner among similar vegetables. As https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325390 notes, some individuals who have been diagnosed with CKD may be asked to stop eating high-potassium vegetables. However, since arugula falls into a low potassium category, it's a leafy green that gets the green light. There's just one aspect of arugula that may make you think twice about eating it all the time: its distinctive, peppery taste. In fact, a YouGov poll showed that arugula falls far short of being a favorite leafy green among consumers in the United States. Just 4% named it the tastiest choice. But there's no need to fear: Benson has some innovative tips for you to enjoy arugula in recipes. \"'[If] you find the flavor too strong, opt for baby green blends, which contain fewer glucosinolates but still offer some of the benefits,\" she said. \"Many people like to mix arugula with other leafy greens and salad veggies to balance the taste. Also, sautéing ... in olive oil with some garlic and a squeeze of lemon can soften the flavor a bit.\"",

    "text": "Kerala: Christians mark Good Friday with solemn processions and prayers The Governor of the Roman province of Judea at the time, Pontius Pilate, ordered the execution of Jesus THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The solemn occasion of Good Friday is being marked by prayers and processions depicting the stations of the cross across the nation. In Thiruvananthapuram, devotees took part in the stations of the cross procession to Saint Joseph's Cathedral in Palayam. The stations of the cross mark Christ's suffering as he was crucified on Good Friday. The procession began early in the morning from the Palayam Saint Joseph Cathedral Church and was attended by Member of Parliament for Thiruvananthapuram, Shashi Tharoor. Visuals show devotees carrying wooden crosses depicting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ during the procession to Saint Joseph's Cathedral in Palayam. Commemorating the crucifixion of Christ, Good Friday services are being held in churches across the state on the day, marking the countdown to Easter Sunday. Meanwhile, devotees also offered prayers in the national capital on the occasion. Father Jolly from the CBCI Centre, Catholic Bishops Conference of India, Headquarters in Delhi elucidated the significance of 'Good Friday' for Christians. Speaking to ANI, Father Jolly said, \"On Good Friday, Christians all over the world remember the passion and death of our blessed lord Jesus Christ. This is a memorial day for us to journey with the suffering and death of Christ on the cross.\" \"By keeping this memorial, we sanctify ourselves, our households and purify our hearts and minds to join our lives with the life of Christ,\" he said. Adding further, he said, \"The sufferings of the Lord Jesus, his cross also remind us that we are all in this world carrying our own crosses, our own sufferings of humanity. The way Jesus reconciled the world to his father, so also this is a day for reconciliation for humanity to join hands with each other and to uphold the values of human fraternity in the world.\" \"We read the passages from the sacred scriptures that speak about the sufferings and death of our blessed lord Jesus on Good Friday. We also meditate on the sufferings of Christ and venerate the cross today,\" he said. The story behind 'Good Friday' is about the day when Jesus was crucified by Romans. A disciple of Jesus, Judas betrayed him which led to his capture by the Romans. The Governor of the Roman province of Judea at the time, Pontius Pilate, ordered the execution of Jesus. Jesus was made to carry his cross through Jerusalem to the place of crucifixion known as Calvary. The day of 'Good Friday' is followed by the celebration known as 'Easter', which refers to the event of the resurrection of Jesus on the third day of his crucifixion.",

    "title": "Kreis Euskirchen: Pläne für den Rettungsdienst sorgen für Unmut",
    "text": "Zwölf Wachen soll der Rettungsdienst im Kreis Euskirchen künftig haben, keine mehr in der Gemeinde Nettersheim. Dort befürchtet man eine Benachteiligung.\nNettersheimer sauerDie Pläne für den Rettungsdienst im Kreis Euskirchen sorgen für Unmut\nStephan Everling\nDer Unmut in Nettersheim über den Entwurf des neuen Rettungsdienstbedarfsplans ist groß. Wie groß, wurde im Gemeinderat deutlich. Um Fragen zu beantworten und das Konzept aus Sicht des Kreises als Träger des Rettungsdienstes zu erklären, waren Landrat Markus Ramers, Geschäftsbereichsleiterin Julia Baron und der Leiter der Gefahrenabwehr, Martin Fehrmann, sowie Sven Ohrem als Gutachter der Firma Lülf+ nach Nettersheim gekommen.\nGerade in Nettersheim ist das Konfliktpotenzial hoch. Bislang ist man in der Kommune in Sachen Rettungswachen ausgesprochen gut ausgestattet. Mit Tondorf und Marmagen liegen zwei der aktuell zehn Standorte im Kreis auf Gemeindegebiet.\nDie Hilfsfristen werden nur in zwei Drittel der Fälle eingehalten\nDoch dabei soll es nicht bleiben. Vor allem die schlechte Quote beim Einhalten der Hilfsfristen macht Veränderungen nötig. In ländlichen Gebieten sollen die Helfer in 90 Prozent der Fälle binnen zwölf Minuten beim Patienten sein. Tatsächlich wird diese Zeit im Kreis in gerade mal rund zwei Drittel der Fälle erreicht.\nZahlreiche mögliche Gründe dafür nennt Fehrmann: Sie können von einer verlängerten Zeit beim Disponenten in der Leitstelle über mangelnde Verfügbarkeit der Rettungswagen bis zu der Struktur der Wachenaufteilung und dem Verkehr reichen. Verbesserungen sollen erzielt werden durch zwei zusätzliche Rettungswachen, die Veränderung einiger Standorte, neun zusätzliche Fahrzeuge und 50 zusätzliche Stellen. Insgesamt sollten die Ressourcen im Rettungsdienst um rund 40 Prozent aufgestockt werden, so Ramers.\nAnalyse im Kreis Euskirchen ergab Unterdeckung im Süden und Osten\nMit einem Wabenmuster habe er analysiert, welche Orte für den Rettungsdienst nicht rechtzeitig zu erreichen seien, erläuterte Ohrem. Dabei habe sich vor allem eine Unterdeckung im südlichen und östlichen Bereich des Kreises ergeben. Verbesserungen sollen erzielt werden, indem beide Rettungswachen das Nettersheimer Gemeindegebiet verlassen: Eine soll demnach in die Gemeinde Dahlem, die andere in die Gemeinde Blankenheim.\n„Ich habe mich nicht an den Gemeindegrenzen orientiert, sondern an den Rettungswachbereichen“, betonte Ohrem. Dennoch verstehe er den Unmut gut. Jedoch werde eine der neuen Wachen in Kall installiert und mit zwei Fahrzeugen ausgestattet, so dass die Hilfsfrist von zwölf Minuten für den Nettersheimer Bereich einzuhalten sei.\nWas die CDU ganz anders sah. Laut Burkhard Rosenbaum hat man sich die Mühe gemacht, mithilfe von Google Maps nachzurechnen, wie lange ein RTW zu den Nettersheimer Orten benötigt – und eine erhebliche Unterdeckung ermittelt. Schon die Schließung der Notaufnahme in Schleiden sei ein Einschnitt gewesen. „Der Bürger fühlt sich unterversorgt, wir können das so nicht akzeptieren“, sagte er.\nNettersheimer Politiker sind verärgert über Standorte der Rettungswachen\nDer Gutachter widersprach dem kaum. Zwar werde mit anderen Fahrzeiten gerechnet, doch das sei eine gute Näherung. „Insgesamt haben wir in Nettersheim Bereiche, die wir in zwölf Minuten nicht erreichen – die waren aber vorher woanders“, bestätigte er. Sein Verfahren sei eine mathematische Optimierung.\nGuido Kurth (CDU) fragte sich, wie er jemandem erklären solle, dass Orte wie Frohngau nicht mehr rechtzeitig erreicht würden. „Ich könnt' mich ärgern ohne Ende“, sagte auch Albert Müllenborn (UNA). Dagegen betonte Gerhard Mayer (SPD), dass die Versorgung weiterhin gegeben sei. Entscheidend seien Wirtschaftlichkeit und Personalverfügbarkeit.\nDie exakten Standorte stehen noch nicht fest\nRamers machte auf die Wichtigkeit der Gesamtbetrachtung aufmerksam: „Die Menschen in Losheim sind so wichtig wie die in Weilerswist.“ Es seien Gespräche mit der Gemeinde geführt worden, da die besondere Situation klar geworden sei. Und: Die definitiven Standorte der Wachen seien noch längst nicht gefunden und beschlossen.\nFür Kall sei Keldenich im Gespräch, für Dahlem Schmidtheim oder Milzenhäuschen, für Blankenheim der Bereich der L115 bei Lommersdorf. Ob darüber hinaus eine weitere Wache geplant werden kann, ist unklar. Laut Ramers sei zu befürchten, dass die Kostenträger – in erster Linie die Krankenkassen – die zusätzlichen Kosten nicht tragen.\nZwei Stunden diskutierten die Vertreter von Gemeinde und Kreis – ohne sich wesentlich näher zu kommen. Schließlich schaltete sich Bürgermeister Crump ein. Er sehe alle Kreisbürger gleich, nehme aber mit, dass nur über Mathematik gesprochen worden sei: „Ich bin auch seit 30 Jahren im Geschäft, ich hätte das Gutachten so gerechnet, dass Nettersheim beide Wachen behält, und das wäre auch wasserdicht gewesen.“\nEr halte es für unverhältnismäßig, einer Gemeinde beide Wachen wegzunehmen. Er regte einen Ratsbeschluss an, in dem vor allem der Erhalt der Wache in Marmagen gefordert werde: „Wir würden auch über andere konstruktive Lösungen reden.“ Einstimmig stimmten die Ratsvertreter dem zu.\nZweite Amtszeit Feuerwehrchef\nZum Leiter der Feuerwehr wurde René Schreiber erneut von Bürgermeister Norbert Crump ernannt. Seit 2019 übt er dieses Amt aus. Seine erste Amtszeit war im April ausgelaufen.\nDoch da nach Mitteilung der Gemeinde nach der Bestellung durch den Gemeinderat noch Aufklärungsbedarf in der Feuerwehr bestanden habe, verzögerte sich die erneute Ernennung um einige Monate. Schreiber sei der einzige Bewerber auf den Posten gewesen, so Crump. Die Löschgruppen und Abteilungen der Nettersheimer Feuerwehr seien angehört worden und hätten dem Vorschlag zugestimmt, führte er aus. Auch Kreisbrandmeister Peter Jonas habe die Bestellung von Schreiber befürwortet, sagte Crump.",

    "text": "Thousands Of Gmail Accounts Being Deleted Soon In New York\nMany people have an email account that they use and then one that they use to sign up for things. If that account for you is a Gmail account, you might want to sign into it.\nThere's a good chance that you have multiple email accounts. Most people have one for work. They might have one that they use often for personal stuff. Then they have one that they use to sign up for newsletters, coupons, and deals that they find while browsing the internet. It's kind of set up to take the junk mail.\nThey don't normally sign in to the \"junk mail\" email address but they might still have other accounts associated with it like their social media accounts.\nIf this is you, and your \"junk mail\" account is a Gmail account, you might want to be sure to log into it this week.\nGoogle is deleting accounts\nGoogle has announced that they are going to begin deleting accounts that have been inactive for two years or more. They're going to begin soon on December 1, 2024. It's not just email either. It will also apply to things you have in Google Docs, Drive, Meet, Calendar, Photos, and YouTube.\nThe goal is to enhance security by removing accounts that are more susceptible to compromise due to outdated passwords and lack of two-factor authentication.\nWhat should you do to keep your account active?\nIt's pretty simple if you want to keep your account active. All you have to do is sign in and do some things like delete some emails, send some emails, or upload a file. Just show that you're active.\nThe good news is that it's that simple to keep your account. Google has said that they will not delete an account without sending multiple emails to both the account email address and the recovery email (if you have provided one). So if your account is about to be deleted, you'll know it's coming. But you'll have to sign in to see the warning.\nGoogle Auto-Completes 'Upstate New York' Search with These Words\nGallery Credit: Dan Bahl",

    "text": "El alcalde de Dozón, Adolfo Campos, expresó ayer su satisfacción por la concesión por parte de la Xunta de 1,5 millones de euros destinados a la construcción de una residencia de mayores y un centro de día en el municipio. Una decisión que fue adoptada en el Consello de la Xunta celebrado ayer. Campos Vázquez resalta que la inversión es « o maior importe outorgado a calquera dos 24 proxectos de equipamentos sociais aprobados en toda Galicia ». Para el regidor esta es « unha gran nova » que achaca, por una parte, « ao bo traballo feito polo goberno local» y, por otra , «o inicio do cumprimento do primeiro punto do programa das pasadas eleccións municipais ». Agradeció « a sensibilidade e o compromiso » del presidente de la Xunta, Alfonso Rueda; de la conselleira de Política Social, Fabiola García, y del gerente del Consorcio Galego de Servizos de Igualdade e Benestar, Perfecto Rodríguez.\nEl Concello ya adquirió en su día una parcela de 5.000 metros cuadrados en la que se ubicará la construcción y ya cuentan con un anteproyecto que estima el coste en 1.835.000 euros, de los cuales 335.000 euros los pondrá el Concello. Se ofertarán 44 plazas, de las que 24 serán para residentes y 20 para usuarios del centro de día. El alcalde apunta que tras la firma del convenio con la Xunta, se encargará el proyecto técnico y constructivo para agilizar la licitación de las obras que se espera que puedan comenzar en el segundo semestre de este año.",

    "text": "CITTA’ DEL VATICANO — Nessuna rinuncia dietro l’angolo, nessun Conclave in preparazione. A fare scudo al Papa malato interviene il cardinale argentino Victor Manuel Fernandez , prefetto dell’ex Santo Uffizio, il porporato di Curia più vicino a Jorge Mario Bergoglio .\nGiovedì il cardinale Gianfranco Ravasi ha rotto il tabù, parlando apertamente della possibilità che se si trovasse impedito in particolare nei contatti frequenti con i fedeli, il Pontefice argentino si dimetterebbe. Per altri due big del collegio cardinalizio, Jean-Marc Aveline di Marsiglia e Juan José Omella Omella di Barcellona, tutto è possibile, per il cardinale decano Giovanni Battista Re invece «non si dovrebbe parlare di dimissioni».\nOra interviene il cardinale Fernandez, che con il quotidiano argentino La Nacion coglie un punto fondamentale: «Non vale la pena che alcuni gruppi premano per le dimissioni. Lo hanno già fatto diverse volte negli ultimi anni e questa non può che essere una decisione “completamente libera” del Santo Padre, affinché possa essere valida». Il codice di diritto canonico, in effetti, prevede che la rinuncia del Romano Pontefice, per essere valida, deve essere «fatta liberamente». Per Fernandez, «è importante che il corpo del Papa abbia risposto bene al trattamento attuale. I segnali di questa reazione positiva sono oggettivi: non solo ciò che si può osservare nell’aspetto, ma soprattutto i risultati degli esami scientifici quotidiani». Non solo: «Non vedo un’atmosfera da pre-conclave, non vedo più conversazioni su un possibile successore rispetto a un anno fa, cioè niente di speciale. Finora ho sentito parecchio rispetto» per Francesco.\nSull’ipotesi delle dimissioni del Papa è intervenuto anche il cardinale Marc Ouellet , prefetto emerito del dicastero dei Vescovi. Francesco «è un uomo molto determinato, molto consacrato al suo ministero ed è anche imprevedibile», ha detto a LaPresse . La famosa lettera di dimissioni preventiva firmata da Francesco a inizio pontificato e consegnata all’allora Segretario di Stato vaticano Tarcisio Bertone , «è una cosa prudenziale», ha notato Ouellet. Ma «anche se non può lavorare con intensità, la Chiesa può aspettare un po’».\nIl Papa, ha detto ancora il porporato canadese, «è fisicamente limitato, ma continua a prendere delle decisioni. Il suo ministero non è interrotto anche se è a riposo. Dobbiamo pregare per il Papa, sostenerlo e incoraggiarlo». Sulla stessa linea monsignor Bruno Forte : non c’è nessuna «necessità» di parlare di dimissioni del Papa, ha detto il vescovo di Chieti-Vasto: «Ogni ministero nella Chiesa è accettato e vissuto nella libertà e le dimissioni di papa Benedetto ne sono un esempio. Ma papa Francesco ha sempre detto di volere andare avanti nel suo ministero finché Dio gli darà la forza. Siccome questa malattia non lo ha assolutamente invalidato e sta addirittura migliorando, io non vedo la necessità di parlare di dimissioni». Il Papa, ha detto monsignor Forte all’ Ansa , «può fare ancora tanto e credo che la preghiera e la Chiesa lo dovrebbe sostenere in questo».\nIeri si è anche diffusa la notizia che al Gemelli il Papa abbia ricevuto insieme i cardinali Pietro Parolin , Segretario di Stato, Gianfranco Ghirlanda , canonista gesuita di fiducia di Francesco, per parlare di rinuncia e regole del Conclave: un incontro che la sala stampa della Santa Sede ha formalmente smentito.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",
