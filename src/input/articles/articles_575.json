    "text": "I am nowadays, having a meal outside in the great outdoors while chatting with others and unwinding has become synonymous with outdoor eating areas. Thanks to the growing need for stunning vistas, fresh air, and a change of pace from inside monotony, this tendency has only gotten stronger in recent years. A welcoming outdoor dining area is largely dependent on the furniture choice. In addition to being functional, outdoor restaurant furniture is essential in determining a restaurant’s entire eating experience and visual atmosphere.\nEvolution of outdoor restaurant furniture\nOriginally, outdoor furniture was primarily practical, made to withstand harsh weather conditions with little regard for aesthetics.\nMaterials like wrought iron and teak were favored for their durability but often lacked the comfort and style expected in dining settings. This evolution of outdoor dining furniture reflects a shift from purely functional designs to stylish pieces that enhance the dining experience.\nHowever, as outdoor dining became more and more popular, particularly in climate-friendly areas, designers started to place equal emphasis on design and durability, which resulted in the creation of materials and building methods that could withstand outdoor conditions while providing comfort and style. More recently, weather-resistant wickers, aluminum alloys, and synthetic materials that mimic the appearance of natural wood without maintenance headaches have all been introduced.\nElement of timeless design\nThe following essential components of timeless commercial outdoor furniture guarantee its ongoing appeal:\nHigh-quality Materials: Because outdoor furniture is exposed to sunshine, rain, and temperature changes, material selection is essential.\nTeak is still a popular choice due to its attractive grain and inherent resistance to dampness and insects. Because of their low weight, strength, and capacity to withstand corrosion, stainless steel and aluminum are highly prized materials for coastal and humid environments. Premium synthetic wickers look like real rattan but require less upkeep and are more weather-resistant.\nComfort and functionality : Comfort is crucial when choosing outdoor dining equipment. Ergonomic designs that provide diners with enough support and let them unwind improve the whole eating experience. By carefully considering elements like armrest shape, backrest angle, and seat height, comfort is enhanced without sacrificing functionality. The materials used to make cushions and upholstery are chosen for their resilience to outside elements without sacrificing comfort or style.\nAesthetic versatility : Classic outdoor furniture designs suit various outdoor environments and architectural types. Earth tones, beige, and grey are predominant examples of neutral colors that accentuate natural surroundings without overpowering them. The furniture’s timeless forms and simple lines guarantee that it will always look good despite fads in style.\nMaintenance : Furniture for outdoor eating areas has to be simple to clean and care for. Stain-, fade-, and mold-resistant materials make maintenance easier and free up restaurant personnel time to concentrate on serving guests great meals rather than doing tedious maintenance work. Quick-drying textiles and non-porous surfaces extend outdoor furniture’s life and visual attractiveness.\nTrends in outdoor restaurant furniture\nAlthough outdoor restaurant furniture is based on timeless design principles, modern trends have an impact on how it evolves and adjusts to shifting consumer preferences:\nSustainable materials : Restaurants use eco-friendly materials like reclaimed wood, recycled plastic, and rattan that are sustainably sourced as part of a rising trend in furniture design. These materials appeal to guests looking for environmentally responsible eating experiences that align with environmental ideals. To reduce their negative effects on the environment and maximize durability and beauty, furniture makers are progressively implementing sustainable techniques into their manufacturing processes.\nFlexibility & modularity : In outdoor dining areas, modular furniture designs that provide a variety of seating configurations are becoming increasingly popular. These designs are aimed at restaurants that need flexible layouts to suit different group sizes, social distancing needs, and seasonal variations in customer traffic. Sectional couches, ottomans, and movable tables are modular furniture that offer adaptability without sacrificing style coherence or comfort.\nIntegration of technology : To improve the eating experience, outdoor dining areas progressively integrate technology-driven amenities. The integrated speakers for background music, USB charging outlets, and movable lighting options provide a sleek and practical ambiance that appeals to tech-savvy customers. These features blend perfectly with outdoor furniture designs, adding practicality without removing the piece’s overall aesthetic appeal.\nPersonalisation & customisation : Many eateries are choosing to use furniture that can be customized to fit their brand and offer distinctive eating experiences. With personalized designs, branded finishes, and custom upholstery fabrics, restaurants may stand out without sacrificing their overall appeal. Beyond furniture choice, personalized touches may also include outside décor, signage, and landscaping, all of which work together to provide customers with an unforgettable eating experience.",

    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues. According to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.” “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.” The 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman. People are also reading… Gregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He [died in 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/27/entertainment/gregg-allman-obituary/index.html) at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications. The petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.” “Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states. “I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” [Cher told People magazine](https://people.com/cher-speaks-out-on-kidnapping-plot-allegations-about-son-not-true-exclusive-8350230) in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse. “I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.” Cher is also the mother of Chaz Bono. A hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation. CNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

    "text": "Autoridades de Tabasco advirtieron por posibles daños en la Laguna de Mecoacán, reconocida como Área Natural Protegida (ANP), tras el derrame de hidrocarburo en registrado en la Terminal Marítima de Dos Bocas, en Tabasco.\nLa titular de la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible (Semades), Sheila Cadena Nieto, indicó en entrevista televisiva que este martes 7 de mayo autoridades estatales, en coordinación con instancias municipales, realizaron un recorrido de inspección en la zona de manglares, bancos ostrícolas y las playas Cocalito, Bruja y Dorada para supervisar los daños al ecosistema.\n“Ayer realizamos un recorrido e identificamos que hasta el interior de la laguna no había rastros de hidrocarburo; sin embargo, pegado al mar, porque es una laguna pegada a la costa, sí encontramos rastros”, dijo.\nContexto: la Laguna de Mecoacán, ubicada en los municipios de Paraíso y Jalpa de Méndez en Tabasco, es uno de los ecosistemas costeros más importantes del estado. Con una extensión aproximada de 17,380 hectáreas, esta laguna forma parte del sistema lagunar Mecoacán-Julivá-Santa Anita y del Corredor Biológico de Manglares del Golfo de México, que abarca los estados de Tamaulipas, Veracruz y Tabasco.\nEste cuerpo de agua es reconocido por su rica biodiversidad y su relevancia ecológica. Alberga manglares de tres especies principales: mangle rojo (Rhizophora mangle), mangle negro (Avicennia germinans) y mangle blanco (Laguncularia racemosa), los cuales desempeñan un papel crucial como corredores biológicos y hábitats para diversas especies de fauna, incluyendo peces, reptiles y aves como la cigüeña americana (Mycteria americana) y el halcón peregrino (Falco peregrinus)\nZona afectada: 16 kilómetros\nCadena Nieto agregó que no tienen la cantidad de hidrocarburo derramado y que llegó a la costa, pero lo que confirmó es la zona afectada, la cual alcanza 16 kilómetros. También aseguró que la prioridad en estos momentos es la limpieza para evitar daños a especies marítimas, y en ese sentido señaló que peces y cangrejos son los más afectados.\nPor último, informó que desde el momento en que se tuvo conocimiento del incidente —el sábado pasado, alrededor de la 1 de la tarde— presentó una denuncia formal ante la Agencia de Seguridad, Energía y Ambiente (ASEA), la cual quedó registrada con el folio PROM 00598.\nAdmiten derrame de hidrocarburo; estos son los daños en las costas\nLa Agencia de Seguridad, Energía y Ambiente (ASEA) anunció que llevará a cabo una supervisión a Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) para investigar el derrame de hidrocarburo registrado en la Terminal Marítima de Dos Bocas, en Tabasco, que habría alcanzado las costas del municipio de Paraíso.\nEn un escueto comunicado indicó que la supervisión tiene como objetivo esclarecer las causas del incidente, cuantificar la sustancia derramada y vigilar las acciones de remediación ambiental que deberán implementarse. La ASEA, órgano desconcentrado de la Semarnat, reiteró su compromiso con la protección del medio ambiente y aseguró que informará de manera continua los avances y medidas adoptadas.\nEl pronunciamiento se da tras la contaminación registrada desde este domingo 4 de mayo principalmente en Playa Sol, donde autoridades municipales izaron la bandera negra como medida preventiva por la presencia de lo que parece ser chapopote.\nContexto: la Refinería Olmeca de Pemex, conocida como “Dos Bocas” ha sido objeto de múltiples denuncias por impactos ambientales negativos en la región. En agosto de 2024, ya se había reportado la presencia de hidrocarburo en Playa del Sol. Las autoridades locales, en coordinación con Pemex, cerraron la playa y comenzaron labores de limpieza.\nPescadores denuncian afectaciones por derrame\nPescadores y habitantes del municipio de Paraíso denunciaron afectaciones a la pesca, el turismo y el entorno ambiental, tras el derrame de hidrocarburo registrado este domingo en la zona costera. La sustancia, identificada como chapopote, se ha extendido por varias playas del municipio, dificultando la actividad productiva y poniendo en riesgo la salud de los visitantes.\n“Pemex solo ha traído ruina y destrucción a Paraíso”, dijo al medio local Voces De Paraíso el pescador Adrián Solís, quien explicó que el crudo en la superficie del mar ha dañado sus redes y lanchas. Aseguró que no es la primera vez que ocurre un incidente de este tipo y exigió a la paraestatal que repare los daños.\n“Según se rompió una tubería y está brotando mucho chapopote. Ya no se puede trabajar. Mi lancha quedó manchada, las redes igual. Aún así salimos porque tenemos que mantener a la familia. No sabemos si Pemex va a pagar o reponer algo”, expresó Solís.\nEn la comunidad costera de Torno Largo también se reportaron afectaciones. El guía turístico Estrifer de la Cruz indicó que desde la madrugada del domingo se percibió un fuerte olor a hidrocarburo, y por seguridad recomendaron a los visitantes no ingresar al mar en la playa “Playita Mirador”.\nJuan Gabriel Rodríguez Pérez, pescador de la Unión 1ra. Sección, también envió un desesperado llamado a los tres niveles de gobierno al ver sus redes destruidas y su sustento familiar en riesgo por la contaminación por hidrocarburo atribuida a Pemex, que afecta toda la costa de Paraíso. “Cómo es posible que entre al mar con guantes a sacar mis redes, parace que estoy trabajando en una industria por tanta contaminación”, dijo en un video.\nAunado esto, en redes sociales también comenzaron a difundirse imágenes de animales afectados por el hidrocarburo.\n¿Qué sucedió en las costas de Paraiso?\nLa zona costera de Paraíso, Tabasco, amaneció este domingo 4 de mayo contaminada con hidrocarburo, presuntamente chapopote, lo que llevó a las autoridades municipales a emitir una alerta preventiva en la playa conocida como Playa Sol. Sin embargo, pese a la presencia del contaminante, el acceso al lugar no fue completamente restringido y se mantuvo cierta actividad turística en el área.\nEl Ayuntamiento de Paraíso informó que, como medida precautoria, fue colocada la bandera negra, que normalmente indica prohibición total para ingresar al mar. “Su seguridad es nuestra prioridad. Debido a la presencia de chapopote en la zona costera, se ha colocado la bandera negra, lo que significa que el acceso al mar no está permitido”, señaló la autoridad en una publicación en Facebook.\nPese a riesgos, hay actividad recreativa\nA pesar de la advertencia de las autoridades de Paraíso, el área de palapas y estacionamiento permaneció este domingo abierta al público. Incluso, las autoridades municipales alentaron la visita familiar, al asegurar que el acceso a esos espacios sería completamente gratuito, minimizando el impacto de la medida. Visitantes reportaron un fuerte olor a hidrocarburo, pero aún así se observó presencia de algunos turistas.\nSegún reportes locales en redes sociales, la sustancia contaminante afecta toda la franja costera del municipio, y hasta el momento se desconocen las causas del derrame. La situación ha afectado directamente a pescadores locales, quienes denunciaron pérdidas ante la imposibilidad de faenar.\nÚNETE A NUESTRO CANAL DE WHATSAPP. EL PODER DE LA INFORMACIÓN EN LA PALMA DE TU MANO\nSÍGUENOS EN EL SHOWCASE DE GOOGLE NEWS\nEl Ayuntamiento aseguró que ya se iniciaron labores de limpieza y se estableció contacto con dependencias estatales y federales para atender la emergencia ambiental.\nHasta el momento, Pemex no se ha pronunciado al respecto.",

    "text": "New Illinois law mandates paid time off for workers SPRINGFIELD (WGEM) - A new Illinois law takes effect Jan. 1, mandating businesses give their full-time employees at least 40 hours of paid time off annually. “This is about bringing dignity to all workers because that is who is impacted by paid leave for all,” state Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, said when Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed the legislation on March 13. She, along with state Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester, sponsored the [legislation](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?name=102-1143&GA=102&SessionId=110&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=208&GAID=16&SpecSess=&Session=). The law requires employers give full-time workers at least one hour of paid time off per 40 hours worked and allow them to accrue a minimum of 40 hours of paid time off annually. “Thanks to this measure, workers have the peace of mind that they can take care of themselves today without worrying about the consequences tomorrow,” Lightford said at the signing ceremony. While the law may bring peace of mind to workers, Noah Finley, the Illinois state director for the National Federation of Independent Business said it brings uncertainty to small businesses across the state. “They’re facing this new mandate they’re having to figure out and, like, we’ve held webinars, the Department of Labor has held webinars but they’re still trying to figure out exactly what that means,” he said. “And it’s going to cost them, they know that, but exactly how that plays out is not entirely clear and it’s just a whole slew of uncertainty.” Adding to the uncertainty, is the Illinois Department of Labor’s (DOL) rulemaking process. Though the new law goes into effect Jan. 1, Finley said he doesn’t expect to see DOL’s rules approved until at least March. Businesses can learn more about the new law on the DOL’s [website](https://labor.illinois.gov/laws-rules/paidleave.html). There’s also a link to a poster all businesses must display informing workers of their rights under the new law. Some workers are exempt from the new law. They include federal workers and college students who work part-time for the university. Copyright 2023 WGEM. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Orações, reflexão e meditação uniram jovens e adultos na Serra da Piedade, em Caeté, região metropolitana de Belo Horizonte, na manhã desta Sexta-Feira da Paixão (29). Vários fiéis fizeram, de crianças a idosos, fizeram a Via Sacra do pé ao topo da Serra da Piedade, conduzidas pelo reitor do Santuário Basílica Nossa Senhora da Piedade, Wagner Calegário. A Via Sacra é uma tradição cristã desde o século IV, quando os fiéis peregrinavam em direção a Jerusalém, percorrendo o caminho feito por Jesus Cristo até o calvário. Mas foi só no século 17 que ela se tornou um rito oficial da Igreja Católica. No ritual, os fiéis relembram e meditam sobre a Paixão e a Morte de Jesus Cristo , em um caminho de purificação para receber a Indulgência Plenária. Durante a caminhada, conduzidos pelo sacerdote, os peregrinos fazem 14 paradas - as 14 estações, cada uma relembrando um momento específico de Jesus até sua crucificação e morte. O padre Wagner Calegário explica que, durante o trajeto, é também um momento do cristão fazer uma reflexão sobre a própria caminhada na Terra. \"Olhamos para cada passo de Jesus Cristo durante o Calvário e fazemos uma alusão com a nossa vida. A cada passo, percebemos quais são nossas quedas, nossas fraquezas, as consolações que encontramos, nossas desolações. E a cada passo, nos unirmos a ele (Jesus)\", ensina. Para muitos fiéis, a Sexta-Feira da Paixão é um momento de tristeza, por relembrar a dor e o sofrimento de Jesus Cristo. Mas padre Wagner chama a atenção para a importância de pensar por outro ângulo. \"A cruz é nosso horizonte, como Ele (Jesus) nos diz. Mas ela não é o ponto final. Nossa vida é feita de alegrias e tristezas. E na Via Sacra, meditando a Escritura, no silêncio e olhando para o futuro, reconfigurar nossa vida\", defende. Devoção e fé Para alguns fiéis, a peregrinação começou antes mesmo da Via Sacra. Alguns participantes foram a pé de casa para a Serra da Piedade. É o caso do vendedor Guilherme Gomes do Santos, de 19 anos. Junto com familiares e amigos, ele saiu às 4h da manhã de Roças Novas rumo à Via Sacra, ritual que, segundo ele, se repete desde 2018. \"Toda Sexta-Feira Santa a gente faz. São oito quilômetros lá de Roças Novas até aqui. Depois mais seis quilômetros até lá em cima (no topo da Serra. Sempre com alegria e muita força\", conta o rapaz. Segundo ele, são pelo menos 40 pessoas. Entre tantos locais que realizam a Via Sacra, Guilherme entende que a Serra da Piedade é mais especial. Este lugar é lindo. Representa muito a cidade. Muitas pessoas vêm de outros estados para visitar\", diz Guilherme, que garante: a caminhada vale a pena. \"Jesus sofreu tanto por nós. Temos que sofrer um pouco por ele também\", defende. Quem também caminhou de casa até a Serra foi o aposentado Vanderlei de Oliveira e Silva, de 70 anos. Ele é responsável por um grupo chamado Trilhas da Fé, que faz peregrinações. Desde 2016, o grupo sai às 5h da manhã de Caeté, na região metropolitana da capital, para participar da Via Sacra. O fiel, católico desde criança, pensa que a Serra da Piedade é o lugar ideal para meditar sobre a Paixão e Morte de Cristo. \"É um lugar que descarrega muito a gente, a gente fica bem leve e sempre no colo da mãe (Nossa Senhora da Piedade). Eu acho que compensa o sacrifício por Jesus\", elogia. Teve também quem foi ao local para participar da Via Sacra na Serra da Piedade pela primeira vez, como a dentista Eloísa Guimarães Costa, de 62 anos. Ela acredita que a Via Sacra é importante para os cristão manterem o coração em Deus, além de ser um momento de gratidão pela vida. Assim como o padre Wagner Calegário, reitor do santuário Nossa Senhora da Piedade, a mulher defende que a Via Sacra não é momento para tristeza. \"Nós temos um Deus que é vivo. Jesus morreu por nós, derramou o sangue por nós. Passamos pelas etapas pensando que ele carregou a cruz dos nossos pecados. E lá em cima, no terceiro dia, teremos a certeza de que Jesus não está morto. Está vivo\", argumenta Eloísa, que pretende voltar à Serra da Piedade ano que vem, para a Via Sacra.",

    "text": "A Kremlin adviser said Monday that “now is not the time” to negotiate with Ukraine in view of the offensive launched on August 6 by Ukrainian forces in the Russian border region of Kursk, but insisted that Moscow’s conditions for resolving the conflict “have not been cancelled.” Ukraine claims control of more than 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory.\n“At the current stage, given this adventure, we will not talk,” Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic adviser Yuri Ushakov told Russian outlet Shot. “At the moment, engaging in a negotiation process would be completely inappropriate,” he stressed, noting that, in any case, the conditions demanded by Russia “are not cancelled.”\nUshakov was referring to the Russian leader’s conditions for ending the war in Ukraine, which include the withdrawal of Kiev’s forces from four regions illegally annexed by Moscow by September 2022. These demands, expressed last June, also include establishing Ukraine’s neutral status and renouncing plans to join NATO.\nWar in Russia\nIn August, commenting on the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk, which for the first time brought war, in a sustained and prolonged manner, to the territory of the country that started the conflict, Putin acknowledged that one of his objectives was to improve the country’s position in any possible negotiations with Moscow, but he assured that Russia did not see “anything to talk about” with kyiv at the moment.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reiterated that peace will only be possible if the Russian military withdraws completely from Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. The Ukrainian leader says he wants to draw up a plan by November, which would serve as a basis for a future peace summit to which the Kremlin must be invited.\n#Russia #rules #negotiations #Ukraine #Kursk #offensive #Diario #Página",
