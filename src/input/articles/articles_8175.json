The structure built with tin sheets went off in the air following heavy winds. The staff on the job to put up tents had a tough time as the entire area is covered by fog.\nDeputy Commissioner Meena Nagaraj, Superintendent of Police Vikram Amate and officers of the Public Works Department and MESCOM visited the place and reviewed the preparations. The administration has imposed restrictions on tourists’ visits to the place during the event. As the road to the hill station is damaged, the administration has decided not to allow heavy vehicles.\nPublished - December 13, 2024 07:59 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "title": "CAUGHT ON CAMERA | Businesses along 44th Street targeted in break-ins in Wyoming, Grandville",
    "text": "WYOMING, Mich. —\nFour businesses along 44th Street in Grandville and Wyoming were broken into overnight on April 6. While police cannot confirm a connection between all four, the business owners believe one man committed all four burglaries.\nThe businesses affected were Bricks Georgetown gas station in Grandville, Tacos El Cunado 44th St, Textures Hair Salon and Allure Nail Spa. All of these businesses are located in the same strip mall.\nLaura Britton is the manager at Bricks Georgetown, and said a man broke in and stole the cash from the register and expensive bottles of alcohol.\nSeen in the security camera photo below, the man is wearing bright yellow gym shoes and carrying a hammer. Britton said he used that hammer to break into the gas station.\n“It was just kind of a mess, and a lot of our customers were concerned and as well as the employees, but we're glad that it happened in the middle of the night when nobody was here, so that's our main thing,” Britton said.\nThe door is now boarded up, and Britton said someone came out to fix the cash drawers. She saw the security camera video from Textures Hair Salon and believes the same man who broke into their business broke into the salon.\n“She showed me her video. It looks like the same guy. I couldn't say for sure,” she said. “They probably had a little crime spree, but I know that they ran out through the back door when we got cameras back there, so I'm sure they'll catch them.”\nBritton said Bricks Georgetown appreciates their customers who shared concerns about the store.\n“The one thing is, our customers came in and went, ‘What the heck? They're messing with our Bricks,’” she said. “We're really glad that we have a lot of loyal customers. They're great people. They're all from the community around here, so and when anything happens, they're always on the lookout, letting us know about weird stuff.”\nFour miles down 44th Street in Wyoming, Lisa Rozema said her Textures Hair Salon was burglarized in thirty seconds.\n“He came in, was in and out in 30 seconds, ran out the back door,” she said.\nThe man, who smashed the glass door with a hammer, took about $150 from the cash register, similar to the other businesses in the strip mall and the gas station.\n“Exactly the same,” she said. “Yeah, went to the right, to the drawers, cleaned them out, and went out the back.”\nThe man is seen in the security camera footage below breaking the glass door, rushing in to take the cash and rushing out of frame.\nNext door, Jaden Marmol said he came into Tacos El Cunado 44th St. and saw the damage.\n“I was cleaning everything up after they busted the window,” he said.\nSeen here in stills from security camera footage, a man used a hammer to break the glass door, smashed the cash registers, and took the money.\nWith the amount of cash stolen, Marmol said it will be a \"little struggle\" for the family-owned restaurant, but they will get through it.\n“We want to thank the community for all their help. You know, the Wyoming police, because you know they're helping us out a lot,\" he said. “We lost a lot of money, but you know, things like this happen, stupid people, stupid decisions. Want to thank everybody for helping us out, still supporting our family-owned business.”\nAllure Nail Spa, at the end of the strip mall, said a man broke their door with a hammer, but when he went behind the counter and found no money, he left without taking anything.\nThe Wyoming Police Department cannot confirm the connection between the robberies in Wyoming and the one in Grandville, but they are investigating the break-ins in Wyoming.\nAnyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact Wyoming Police\ndetectives at 616-530-7300 or Silent Observer at 616-774-2345; 1-866-774-2345; or silentobserver.org\nAnyone with information regarding the break-in at Bricks is asked to contact the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Department.",

    "text": "Graeter's Ice Cream has introduced a new ice cream flavor in collaboration with Skyline Chili - Skyline Spice with Oyster crackers. It is a limited-edition flavor that will feature the two brands joining hands starting on January 27, 2025. Fans, however, have shared a mixed reaction to the announcement.\nGraeter's announced the collaboration on their social media channels, writing:\n\"It's real and it's spectacular! Graeter's Ice Cream and Skyline Chili, two Cincinnati icons, bring you this one of a kind collaboration. This limited edition ice cream features Skyline's signature spice mix, and crunchy oyster crackers!\n\"On January 27th, Skyline Spice with Oyster Crackers will be available in all of our scoop shops, in participating Skyline Chili restaurants, select Midwest Kroger locations, and online for nationwide shipping!\"\nFans have a mixed reaction to Graeter's Skyline Chili ice cream\nGraeter's limited-edition Skyline chili ice cream will feature the latter's spice mix along with crunchy oyster crackers. While some fans are excited to try this new flavor, others are not so keen. One fan wrote on X (formerly Twitter):\n\"No thanks my dude, I prefer these separately; Coneys first then followed by a trip to get ice cream. Who ever did this was not cooking.\"\n\"I’m frightened and intrigued all at once,\" another fan[tweeted].\n\"Y'all might be doing too much... but I'ma take a bite, just because!\" another[wrote].\nJason and Travis Kelce react to Graeter's Skyline Chili ice cream flavor\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce, who was a former football player, also shared their reaction to Graeter's ice cream's new flavor. While the younger brother Travis wasn't too keen on the combination, his older brother was eager to try it.\nOn their \"New Heights\" podcast, Travis Kelce said:\n“This is so disgusting.” He added that Graeter’s Black Raspberry Chip ice cream is its \"one good flavor.\"\nJason Kelce, meanwhile, said:\n“I’m a sucker for these stupid, new food-item things. I always go to Taco Bell and get like their Dorito-shell whatever and it tastes terrible all the time. But I’ve got higher expectations for Graeter’s.”\nGraeter's also sent a pint of the new flavor for Jason to try along with some pints of some of their classic flavors.\nGraeter's Ice Cream CEO Richard Graeter on their new collaboration\nWhile launching their collaboration with Skyline Chili, Graeter's ice cream CEO Richard Graeter said:\n\"Everyone who knows chili knows Skyline and, as longtime fans ourselves, we were eager to collaborate on a one-of-a-kind, must-try flavor.\n\"Last year, speculation about our unconventional and somewhat polarizing partnership started a social media frenzy. We spent months perfecting the recipe and are extremely happy to confirm the rumors are true – and the flavor will surprise you.\"\nMeanwhile, Skyline Chili's chairman and CEO, Dick Williams, said:\n\"This is the first time Skyline has done a dessert collaboration, so we knew it needed to be worth it. Graeter's Skyline Spice Ice Cream has the heart and soul of both beloved Midwest-born brands in every bite.\"\nThe new flavor was launched on January 27, 2025, and is available on their online platforms and in stores. As of now, the time period for the new flavor to remain on the shelves is unclear.\nAlso Read: Ben & Jerry's launches 4 new flavors in the U.S.: Flavors and availability explored",
