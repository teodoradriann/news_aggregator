Mora was quoted as saying, “We are here praying for Matagalpa church, praying for Bishop Rolando,” adding, “Unfortunately, (Mora) was arrested the next day.”\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, is serving a 26-year prison sentence for charges including conspiracy and treason. He refused to leave the country with 200 others opposing the government.\nThe condition of Mora since the arrest remains unknown, as per one source.\nThe other source told CNN the “persecution against the church in Nicaragua is very strong. We shut up because if we say something we face threats. We know the world knows, but we suffer the pain.”\nSince 2018, tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled the country to escape persecution when Ortega’s government suppressed widespread anti-regime protests, resulting in numerous deaths, injuries, and arbitrary detentions, according to Human Rights Watch.\nOrtega and Vice President Rosario Murillo view the Catholic Church as opposition forces, labelling the protests as an “attempted coup.”\nMora’s arrest follows the expulsion of two Costa Rican nuns from Nicaragua in April after praying for Alvarez.\nYader Morazan, an expert in Nicaragua’s judiciary system, highlighted a “repressive pattern” against the Catholic Church, with dozens of priests and laymen jailed, and over 200 people, including priests and nuns, expelled or blocked from returning.\nA news release from state-owned website El19digital on Monday reported the arrest of 11 people linked to Christian organisations accused of money laundering.\nOrtega secured a fifth term as president in 2021. His government, citing a vague national security law, began detaining opposition figures, journalists, and activists ahead of the elections in June of that year, CNN reported.

    "title": "UN forum on sustainable development concludes with renewed commitment, call for urgent action | UN News",
    "text": "The High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development concluded on Wednesday, with nations reiterating the need for renewed impetus and accelerated actions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the 2030 deadline. Held under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Forum took place from 8 to 17 July . This year’s theme was Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions. The session included a three-day ministerial segment from 15 to 17 July as part of the High-Level Segment of the Council. Key votes on ministerial declaration The adoption of a ministerial declaration , a key outcome of the Forum, was marked by robust debate among Member States, culminating in two key votes on amendments. One proposal involved the inclusion of a paragraph “strongly urging” States to refrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international law and the UN Charter that impede the full achievement of economic and social development, in particular in developing countries. The inclusion – proposed among others by Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Russia and Syria – was agreed with a recorded vote of 105 nations in favour, 11 against and 46 abstentions. The other amendment, proposed by Israel called for the deletion of a paragraph that “recognized” that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development. That paragraph also called for “further effective measures and actions” to be taken, in conformity with international law, to remove the obstacles to the full realization of the right to self-determination of peoples living under colonial and foreign occupation, which continue to adversely affect their economic and social development as well as the environment. In a recorded vote, the Forum decided to retain this paragraph, with 122 Member States voting for retention and two voting for deletion (Israel and United States). Thirty-nine States abstained. The ministerial declaration , as amended, was then adopted without a vote. Commitment renewed Addressing the Forum after the adoption, Paula Narváez, ECOSOC President, highlighted that the ministerial declaration “reinforced once again” the urgency of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. “This high-level political forum has highlighted that it is not too late to make sustainable development a reality.” She also recognized the efforts of Ambassador José Blanco of the Dominican Republic and Ambassador Merete Fjeld Brattested of Norway for their leadership as facilitators of “complex negotiations, which were conducted in an exceptional, transparent and inclusive manner”. Complex, inclusive negotiations She added that delegations negotiated for over 70 hours, with 20 informal and 3 informal-informal sessions, “making every effort to bring together the different opposing positions and present an ambitious and balanced document”. The ECOSOC President concluded by stressing the body’s collective resolve to accelerate the implementation of SDGs and advance sustainable development, and to undertake the transformations necessary to achieve that objective. “We will continue to renew multilateral efforts to fulfil the promise of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind,” she said.",

    "text": "leh ladakh india’s coldest desert is now too hot to handle, airlines announce mass cancellation as temp rises Ladakh: Leh-Ladakh, once famously known as India’s Coldest desert has now become too hot to handle as day-time temperature increased to 35 degrees Celsius. Several Indian airlines have announced mass cancellation of flights. Several passengers are reported to be stranded at the Leh airport, claimed users on X(formally Twitter) adding that almost 12 flights have been cancelled in the past three days. IndiGo cancelled flight bookings on its website till July 31. In a post on X, the airline, on Monday announced a refund to passengers affected by the cancellation, it wrote, “High ground temperatures and runway restrictions in #Leh have necessitated the cancellation of all flights for today. If you wish to re-book or claim a refund, visit https://bit.ly/3MxSLeE We regret the inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding.” Flight cancellations due to extreme weather conditions have become common in Leh-Ladakh. However, this is the first time that mass flight cancellations have occurred because of unbearably high daytime temperatures. The low air density at high altitudes, like in Leh, can degrade aircraft engine performance, reported TOI. As altitude increases, air temperatures drop, and air pressure decreases, causing air molecules to expand and lowering overall air density. This reduction in air density means there is less oxygen available, which is why mountaineers use oxygen cylinders at high altitudes. Leh airport is located over 14,000 feet above sea level, which poses significant challenges for aircraft operations compared to other places in the country. The air pressure in Leh is naturally lower year-round, and any abnormal increase in temperature can further decrease air density. Thin air density impacts aircraft engine performance, particularly during climbing and landing phases, as the engines must generate higher speeds to stay aloft. Under such challenging conditions, coupled with unusual temperatures, aircraft engines may not be able to produce enough thrust to carry a commercially viable load, according to TOI.",

Além disso, ele alegou que, devido à grande quantidade de material acumulado, o fogo atingiu uma área maior do que o planejado.\nA polícia concluiu, no entanto, que a queimada dos resíduos orgânicos ocorreu de forma deliberada, com a finalidade de manejo da área para fins de atividade agrícola, sem a devida autorização ambiental, configurando nexo causal direto entre a conduta do responsável e os impactos ambientais.\nA multa aplicada no auto de infração ambiental foi de R$ 77.040,00.\n2 de 7 Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental\n3 de 7 Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental\n4 de 7 Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental\n5 de 7 Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental Queimada resultou em multa de mais de R$ 77 mil em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Polícia Militar Ambiental\n6 de 7 Queimada atingiu área de 25 hectares em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Google Earth/Polícia Militar Ambiental Queimada atingiu área de 25 hectares em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Google Earth/Polícia Militar Ambiental\n7 de 7 Queimada atingiu área de 25 hectares em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Inpe/Polícia Militar Ambiental Queimada atingiu área de 25 hectares em Presidente Epitácio (SP) — Foto: Inpe/Polícia Militar Ambiental\nVÍDEOS: Tudo sobre a região de Presidente Prudente\n50 vídeos Veja mais notícias em g1 Presidente Prudente e Região .\nPresidente Epitácio",
