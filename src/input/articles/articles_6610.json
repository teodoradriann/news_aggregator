    "text": "DENVER — Coloradans who had a vehicle or catalytic converter stolen in 2023 may be able to get money to help offset some of the costs of dealing with theft thanks to new funds made available through the state. SB23-257, or the [Auto Theft Prevention Cash Fund,](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/SB23-257) made available roughly $5 million of general funds to support victims who need help with secondary costs. “The secondary costs aren’t things like vehicle replacement, or vehicle repair, those would be primary costs. These are secondary things that may be unknown to folks when their vehicle is stolen or recovered that we can assist with,” said Cale Gould, Public Outreach Coordinator with the [Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority.](https://csp.colorado.gov/services-we-provide/colorado-auto-theft-prevention-authority) Fees covered include money to help offset the costs of towing and storing a stolen vehicle. Gould said some of the fees covered are part of dealing with theft that people might not consider. “Generally if it is either operable or part of a larger investigation, it is taken to a tow yard or a police impound lot. And there's fees associated with that,” said Gould. When [auto theft victims in Colorado](https://www.denver7.com/news/state-news/colorado-car-thefts-are-down-after-pandemic-surge-state-crime-data-shows) do get their vehicle back, they often find it to be in a less than desirable condition. There is assistance to help cover some of the costs of getting the stolen ride back into better condition. “And this will include detailing, cleaning a vehicle to make it again, you know, usable in a comfortable way,” said Gould. Financial assistance might also be available to help cover the costs of temporary transportation like RTD passes and Uber fees when a vehicle is stolen. Catalytic converter theft in Colorado has skyrocketed over the last few years and the state has made available funds to help those victims with secondary costs. [ 3:20 PM, Jul 01, 2023 ](https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/new-auto-theft-laws-take-effect-in-colorado) Local News New auto theft laws take effect in Colorado Gould said victims can apply for money to help cover hardening devices to protect your catalytic converter from theft. To qualify for assistance for either auto or catalytic converter theft, the vehicle must have had current registration when the theft occurred. An important date to remember is July 1, 2023. Coloradans can apply for help only if they had their vehicle or catalytic converter stolen after July 1. Coloradans who want to get financial help to cover secondary costs due to auto or catalytic converter theft must apply at [lockdownyourcar.org](https://lockdownyourcar.org/) and visit the [victim’s assistance page.](https://lockdownyourcar.org/resources/victims-assistance/) The site details what is covered and how to apply. Gould said the grant application process is made easier by working through a local advocate. “We try and provide a personal response, personal touch to a single person to guide you through the process as it can be very challenging to understand how to apply,” said Gould. “We want to make sure that everybody applies and has guidance in doing such.” The website, through Colorado State Patrol’s Victim Services Unit [lists the various districts throughout the state and which advocate](https://csp.colorado.gov/services-we-provide/victim-rights) serves your local area. While auto theft in Colorado surged over the last couple of years, the state has seen a decline in 2023. [Data from the Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority](https://coloradocrimestats.state.co.us/tops/report/mvt/colorado/2023) showed 29,098 vehicles were stolen through October of this year. That's a significant decline from the 41,184 vehicles reported stolen in Colorado throughout 2022. The 2023 data does not reflect November or December thefts. The Denver Police Department also reported a [25 percent decline in auto thefts in 2023, showing 11,865 stolen vehicles](https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Police-Department/Crime-Information/Additional-Crime-Dashboards) which is down from the 14,813 reported in 2022. While auto thefts in Denver have declined, catalytic converter thefts continued to climb in data reported by DPD in 2023. [ 5:31 PM, Dec 11, 2023 ](https://www.denver7.com/news/state-news/colorado-car-thefts-are-down-after-pandemic-surge-state-crime-data-shows) State News Colorado car thefts are down after pandemic surge, state crime data shows DPD statistics showed 3,022 stolen catalytic converters this year compared to 2,676 thefts in 2022. To give context in those numbers, the vast majority of increases in catalytic converter theft in Denver happened at Denver International Airport at DIA's associated parking and rental car lots. There was a staggering 857 percent increase in catalytic converter theft at DIA in 2023. According to DPD's statistics, all other police districts showed a year-over-year decline in catalytic converter thefts.",

    "title": "NFL news: Sean Payton explains decision to bench Russell Wilson",
    "text": "The Denver Broncos benched quarterback Russell Wilson on Wednesday, a move that was likely influenced at least in part by the QB’s contract.\nIf Wilson suffers a serious injury and can’t pass a physical in March, his $37 million salary in 2025 would become guaranteed. Benching the QB rules out the risk of Wilson getting injured in one of the final two games of the season.\nBroncos coach Sean Payton acknowledged an “economic” aspect of the decision on Wednesday, but he also insisted that he’s trying to get a spark and win games. Payton apparently believes quarterback Jarrett Stidham gives the team a good chance to win over the next two weeks.\n“Most of you know we made a change at quarterback,” Payton said after Wednesday’s practice. “I understand all the speculation and everything that surrounds a move like that. I can tell you [that] we’re desperately trying to win.\n“Sure, in our game today there are economics and all those other things, but the No. 1 push behind this — and it’s a decision I’m making — is to get a spark offensively. Obviously, it’s difficult.”\nWhen asked for specifics, Payton initially danced around the question before mentioning turnovers and scoring.\n“Rather than get into the specifics — because I think that would be unfair today — it’s more about what we weren’t doing effectively enough offensively,” Payton said. “When we were getting two or three turnovers, that’s one thing. Ultimately, our job is to get the ball in the end zone, and we have to be more efficient doing that — all of us.”\nWilson isn’t the only one who has struggled on offense, though, so why is he the one taking the fall?\n“I get that, and yet, I can’t replace the entire offensive line,” Payton said. “I can’t bring in five new receivers. If [the offense struggling] continues over a period of time, there will be another guy here talking to you, as well. These are difficult decisions. Obviously, there’s more attention when it’s the quarterback who’s under contract, but different than maybe earlier decisions we’ve made with last year’s prior starters.\n“I can just assure you one thing – I’ve said this to Greg [Penner] and George [Paton] a number of times – I’m just interested in winning. It doesn’t matter how. When you do this for this long a period, that’s all you’re interested in because there’s nothing like it. The other side of it — there’s nothing like that, either. That’s kind of what it is.”\nStidham, who will replace Wilson, has started two games in his career, both of them losses with the Las Vegas Raiders last season.\nFollow the Broncos Wire Podcast:\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts\nGallery These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans View 24 photos\nMore Broncos Buzz Broncos injuries: WR Courtland Sutton did not practice Thursday Report: Russell Wilson expects to be cut by Broncos in March Russell Wilson 'liked' these tweets after being benched by the Broncos Broncos Wire podcast: Reaction to Russell Wilson getting benched Broncos vs. Chargers broadcast map: Will the game be on TV?",

    "text": "Winnipeg's favourite meeting place is declaring winter officially here and offering special free activities to celebrate its snow and ice-covered spaces. The Forks officially opened its on-land trails for walking and skating this weekend at the Winnipeg 150 Winter Park. Marketing and communications manager Zach Peters said their special \"Learn to Winter\" programming will be offered every weekend from now until the end of February. \"We have some skate, ski, and snowshoe lessons every Saturday and Sunday that we're partnering with Winnipeg Trails to run,\" Peters said. \"Then on Sundays from 12 till 4 we have some music happening by the canopy rink, each weekend will be different DJ or performer.\" Peters said Elder Barbara Nepinak will also be leading story time and drumming inside the teepee at The Forks, and warming hut tours will also begin later this month. All programming is free. Guests are invited to bring their own equipment or rent on site. Peters said even with cold temperatures on the way, Winnipeggers can stay warm at The Forks. \"People come inside the Forks Market, take their winter stuff off, have a hot chocolate or some mini doughnuts, but then go back out there,\" said Peters. \"Enjoy the skating rink. Enjoy the new trails as part of the Winnipeg 150 Winter Park. Hopefully eventually you'll be able to even get down onto the river trail once it's up and running.\" Unfortunately, skaters will not be able to traverse the historic rail bridge, which takes a walking path across the Assiniboine River and has been closed since June 2023 due to structural concerns. \"We share in the disappointment of folks who use that bridge either for the skating trail that usually crosses in winter or for daily commuting, coming through The Forks into downtown or from downtown,\" said Peters. \"We were disappointed, we want that bridge to be up and running.\" There is currently no timeline on the bridge repair, as its condition is still being assessed.

    "text": "AMMAN — The Board of Directors of the Amman Chamber of Commerce (ACC) on Wednesday expressed its appreciation for the supportive stance of South Africa against the Israeli aggression on Gaza, commending the country's efforts to file a case before the International Court of Justice and denounce the Israeli war crimes.\nDuring a meeting with Ambassador of South Africa Tselane Mokuena, President of Jordan Chamber of Commerce Khalil Hajj Tawfiq stressed that the chamber will push forward efforts towards increasing imports between the two countries, organising joint exhibitions and reviving bilateral agreements signed with the chambers of commerce in Johannesburg and Cape Town.\nThe ACC is planning to organise a visit by a Jordanian trade delegation to South Africa in the middle of the year to promote trade between the two nations, he said.\nBoard members highlighted several challenges faced by Jordanian traders in importing from South Africa, including high shipping costs, customs fees, and the lack of direct flights and sea lines between the two countries, according to the Jordan News Agency, Petra.\nThe tourism sector being a key priority for both countries, they emphasised the need for enhancing cooperation, especially given Jordan's attractive religious, therapeutic and recreational sites.\nMokuena also expressed her country's interest in strengthening economic relations with Jordan, increasing the level of trade and investment exchanges and promoting cooperation between economic entities in both countries.\nShe also stressed the need to explore new strategies for development and growth, especially as Jordan is the most stable country in the region. She also praised the effective efforts of the ACC and its continuous efforts to promote all economic events.\nJordan's exports to South Africa amounted to about $37 million in 2022, while imports amounted to $99 million. The chemical, textile, machinery, metal and food industries are the most prominent exports from Jordan to the South African market.",
