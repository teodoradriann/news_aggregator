    "text": "Kevin Costner feels lucky to be celebrating another birthday. The filmmaker and actor celebrated his 70th birthday on January 18th.\nTo commemorate the occasion, he shared a post of himself and his close friend Whitney Houston on the set of \"The Bodyguard,\" sharing a message that illustrated their friendship and how special of a person she was.\nThe photo showed Costner, Hoston, and Ellin La Var, who styled Houston's hair in the film. The three look young and happy and are smiling for the camera, with Costner having his arm wrapped around Houston.\nHe wore a black jacket, a white polo shirt, and jeans, while she wore an all-black outfit.\n“This photo reminds me of how lucky I am to be getting another birthday,” Costner wrote in the post, which he shared on his Instagram stories.\n“We lost such a light when we lost Whitney.”\nThe photo was originally shared by Houston's Instagram account, which is now managed by her estate. “Happy birthday to Kevin Costner!,” reads the caption.\n“A behind-the-scenes photo from ‘The Bodyguard’ with Kevin, Whitney and Ellin LaVar, Whitney’s hairstylist for the film.”\nCostner often reminisces about Houston and her talent\n\"The Bodyguard\" was released in 1992, becoming a box-office success and launching one of the world's most famous songs: Houston's cover of \"I Will Always Love You.\"\nThe song and the film launched Houston's career to incredible heights, making her one of the most influential artists in the world. It also resulted in the friendship between Houston and Costner, one that would prevail over the years. Their love was such that Costner was one of the speakers at her funeral.\n\"I don't think we'll ever forget when that little song came out, that she just blew up,” said Costner in 2022, in an interview with PEOPLE. “She sang the first part of it a cappella and musically the world was never the same.\"\n\"We have a moment of her in that movie we'll never ever forget that and I think that when movies are working at their best, that's what can happen,\" he said.",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| New Delhi | Updated: 05-05-2024 10:01 IST | Created: 05-05-2024 10:01 IST - Country: - India India will never give up its claim on Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir (PoK) but it won't have to capture it with force because its people, on their own, would want to be part of India after seeing the development in Kashmir, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has said. In an exclusive interview to PTI, Singh asserted that the ground situation has improved significantly in Jammu and Kashmir and that a time will come when AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) will no longer be required in the Union Territory. The defence minister, however, said the matter is under the domain of the Union Home Ministry and it will take appropriate decisions. He said elections will also be held there definitely, but wouldn't give a timeline. ''I think India will not have to do anything. The way the ground situation has changed in Jammu and Kashmir, the way the region is witnessing economic progress and the way peace has returned there, I think demands will emerge from people of PoK that they should merge with India,'' he said. ''We will not have to use force to take PoK as people would say that we must be merged with India. Such demands are now coming,'' he said. The defence minister asserted that ''PoK was, is, and will remain ours''. Citing improvement in the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Singh said assembly elections will be held there soon, but did not give a timeline. ''The way the situation is improving in Jammu and Kashmir, I think a time will come when AFSPA will no longer be required there. It is my view and it is for the Home Ministry to decide on it,'' he said. The AFSPA empowers security forces to conduct operations and arrest anyone without any prior warrant. It also gives immunity to the forces if they shoot someone dead. The defence minister, referring to Pakistan's proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir, said Islamabad must stop cross border terrorism. ''They are trying to destabilise India and we will not allow it to happen,'' he said. The ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after India's warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan in February 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack. The relations further deteriorated after India on August 5, 2019 announced the withdrawal of special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and the bifurcation of the state into two union territories. India has been maintaining that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan while insisting that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility for such an engagement.

    "text": "Oli Dugmore 4am - 7am Northern Lights seen across UK as people share spectacular sightings of the aurora borealis 11 October 2024, 09:08 | Updated: 11 October 2024, 09:10 The Northern Lights were visible across huge parts of the UK on Thursday night, leading to some spectacular pictures being captured. Listen to this article Loading audio... The aurora is largely influenced by geomagnetic storms and the Met Office had said there was a \"severe\" one due to reach Earth overnight on 10 October. This led to sightings of the phenomena across the UK on Thursday night, with reports it was visible across Britain, as far south as Sussex. The Met Office had said that viewings were likely in Scotland and Northern Ireland and possible in the north of England and the Midlands. Met Office spokesperson Stephen Dixon said that further residual viewings could be possible over the weekend but are likely to be confined to the likes of Scotland and could be obscured by rain and cloud. The auroras are most common over high polar latitudes but can sometimes spread south over parts of the UK. The geomagnetic storms often originate from the sun, which works on a cycle of around 11 years with peak sunspot activity referred to as solar maximum. Sunspots give the potential for Earth-directed releases of large bursts of energy, which can lead to aurora visibility. Mr Dixon said: \"We're near the peak of that solar cycle so there have been more space weather events in recent months. \"International prediction centres, including the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre, are expecting solar maximum to be later this year or early next year.\" [Read more: Parts of UK have 'decent chance' of seeing Northern Lights tonight](/news/northern-lights-uk-tonight-weather-sighting-aurora-borealis/) [Read more: Rare Steve phenomenon and Northern Lights grace UK skies - with aurora 'likely' visible tonight](/news/rare-steve-phenomenon-and-northern-lights-light-up-uk-skies-with-aurora-likely-v/) Consequently, it will still be possible to see the Northern Lights once we pass solar maximum but there will be a decline in such activity. The aurora displays occur when charged particles collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere causing them to emit light at various wavelengths, creating the stunning sights.",

    "title": "PR afirma que Governo e Forças Armadas \"minimizaram o problema\" ocorrido com Rangel",
    "text": "O Presidente da República afirmou hoje que falou com Governo e Forças Armadas e ambos \"minimizaram o problema\" ocorrido com o ministro de Estado e dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Paulo Rangel, na base aérea militar de Figo Maduro. Em declarações aos jornalistas, no fim de uma visita ao Museu do Design, em Lisboa, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa referiu que a versão que lhe chegou foi que \"houve equívocos\" e que as autoridades militares que ouviu afastaram que houvesse \"algum melindre ou alguma razão de queixa\". \"A mim o que me chegou foram versões muito coincidentes que minimizaram o problema\", acrescentou o chefe de Estado e comandante supremo das Forças Armadas. O Presidente da República realçou que \"o Governo diz uma coisa e as autoridades militares dizem a mesma coisa\", que \"corresponde a uma desdramatização\". Em causa estão notícias de alegadas ofensas dirigidas por Paulo Rangel ao chefe do Estado-Maior da Força Aérea e outros militares na base aérea de Figo Maduro na noite de 04 de outubro, em que chegou um voo de repatriamento de portugueses do Líbano, o que já levou o PS e o Chega a pedir a audição parlamentar do ministro de Estado e dos Negócios Estrangeiros. Questionado sobre este assunto, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa começou por responder que procurou informar-se \"junto do Governo, naturalmente, do senhor primeiro-ministro, e junto das Forças Armadas acerca do que se tinha passado\". \"E aquilo que me chegou, de um lado e de outro, corresponde a uma desdramatização e uma versão que se traduz desta maneira, para simplificar, e que eu aliás já vivi, já me aconteceu\", disse. O Presidente da República recordou situações que lhe aconteceram \"duas ou três vezes na chegada de evacuados e de refugiados\" à base aérea de Figo Maduro: \"É eu dirigir-me porque tinha a informação que era um sítio, e eles saíam por outro sítio\". Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa realçou, depois, que \"na altura era mais fácil, porque não havia o que existe já há algum tempo, que é uma separação, por razões de segurança, que nem mesmo com o Presidente a chegar lá é fácil de abrir, porque, se não tiver havido prevenção e não estiver tudo preparado, eu tenho de esperar pela abertura\". \"Eu admito que tenha acontecido aquilo que já me incomodou algumas vezes, porque normalmente é noite, madrugada, em que se tem uma indicação dos serviços de apoio nossos de que é num sítio, depois não é nesse sítio, é noutro\", sugeriu. Interrogado se ficou totalmente esclarecido com as informações que obteve do Governo e das Forças Armadas, o chefe de Estado respondeu: \"Eu fiquei esclarecido que não encontrei uma versão que fosse muito diferente uma da outra e que fossem muito graves\". Ressalvou, porém, que \"não estava lá\" e que a situação não foi com ele. \"Mas comigo aconteceu, não foi nada ofensivo, mas houve realmente um desencontro administrativo\", reiterou. Na quarta-feira, o primeiro-ministro, Luís Montenegro, declarou que conhece este episódio \"com minúcia\" e manifestou \"total confiança\" no ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, considerando que se está \"a criar um caso\" a partir \"de imprecisões, de incorreções em notícias\". \"Se há aqui alguém que quer abanar o Governo e abanar a presença do ministro Paulo Rangel no Governo, vá treinando porque tem muito que fazer\", declarou Luís Montenegro aos jornalistas, em Faro. O chefe do Governo PSD/CDS-PP salientou que desconhece qualquer queixa de uma autoridade militar em relação ao titular da pasta dos Negócios Estrangeiros. A agência Lusa tentou confirmar os alegados acontecimentos junto da Força Aérea, mas fonte oficial do ramo escusou-se a comentar.",
