    "text": "IRWINDALE, Calif. (KABC) -- Thousands of volunteers are working around the clock to get the Rose Parade floats decorated in time for New Year's Day. But some of those longtime volunteers have a special connection to the parade, the floats, and their themes.\nRegina Armstrong is among the many volunteers at Fiesta Parade floats. She is proud to be able to work on the float for One Legacy Donate Life. She is a two-time organ transplant recipient. It was in March 1987 when then 12-year-old Regina received a heart transplant. ABC7 reported on Armstrong's heart transplant, because she was UCLA's youngest heart transplant recipient at the time.\n\"I also received a kidney transplant due to long-term medication, and that would be five years on New Year's Eve on Sunday,\" said Armstrong.\nArmstrong is now 49 years old living a healthy life and has a beautiful family. Back in 2020, she rode on the float for One Legacy Donate Life. Now, she is also a decorating float specialist with the nonprofit and has been volunteering for six years.\n\"It's my way of saying thank you to my donors' families for the gift of life, so this is my way of giving back,\" said Armstrong.\nMike Thompson is the float supervisor for Donate Life. \"Each and every one of the volunteers here truly cares. Regina is just the epitome of it.\"\nMORE: An inside look at the nerve center of the Rose Parade",

    "text": "The Norwegian government [has allocated](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/norway-allocates-two-billion-norwegian-kroner-to-increase-production-capacity-of-ammunition/id3022083/) over $190 million to increase production capacity in the Norwegian defense industry, mainly for artillery ammunition. Ukraine and Norway itself, as well as its other allies, will be supplied with the planned ammunition. Previously, the European Union promised Ukraine 1 million artillery shells by March 2024 but has delivered only 300,000 so far. “The war in Ukraine leads to a spur in demand for ammunition. The government will increase the financial support for the Norwegian defense industry in order to ramp up ammunition production,” Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre stated. According to the official, half of the funding will be allocated to specific projects at the aerospace and defense company Nammo, and another $95 million will be provided to other projects within the Norwegian defense industry. “Enhancing the capacity in the defense industry is important, both for Ukraine and for our own security. We are now contributing to a significant increase in production capacity at Nammo to meet the needs of Norway, allies, and Ukraine,” said Minister of Defense Bjørn Arild Gram. Earlier, the Norwegian defense minister announced Oslo would send two F-16 fighter jets to assist in training Ukrainian pilots on the US-made aircraft in Denmark. [Norway to send F-16 jets, instructors to assist training Ukrainian pilots in Denmark] According to Ukraine’s Air Forces, the F-16 is expected to boost Ukraine’s air force in the ongoing war with Russia and become Ukraine’s primary combat aircraft. In his speech, Gram said Norway had already sent ten instructors to Denmark to help train Ukrainian pilots. By sending jets and instructors, Norway joins other nations, including Denmark and the Netherlands, that have pledged support for training Ukrainian pilots. Read also:",

    "text": "By Kanishka Singh\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) – The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post.\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\nIn November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under the sweeping national security law in 2020 and denied bail.\nBeijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces, and extremism with up to life in prison.\nKEY QUOTES\nThe trauma of detention and continued surveillance left Chung with a feeling of “immense pressure and fear,” compelling him to leave, he told the newspaper.\nChung also said he was made to take part in a compulsory “deradicalization” program in detention.\nGuards “kept telling us (him and others in prison) that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,” Chung was quoted as saying. “We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn’t disagree or argue back.”\nChung was eventually released in June 2023 after his time was reduced for good behavior, according to the Washington Post. He plans to continue his studies and told the Post he will contribute everything he can in exile, “just as before.”\nCONTEXT\nChung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect.\nProsecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home.\nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio)",

By halftime Sunday afternoon, LSU has already put up 50 points and questions on if Ole Miss could slow it down seemed to be silenced. Then the Rebels went to the three-quarter court press and stifled the Tigers' attack. But the No. 7-ranked [Tigers weathered the storm in their Southeastern Conference road test](/story/sports/college/lsu/2024/01/07/lsu-womens-basketball-ole-miss-score-live-updates/72119872007/), outlasting Ole Miss, 84-73, inside the Pavilion. Star Angel Reese helped her team survive, putting up 10 of her game-high 21 points in the second half. LSU women's basketball loses control of game in second half vs. Ole Miss' pressure defense Coming in, Ole Miss coach Yolette McPhee-McCuin's team ranked 13th in the country in scoring defense, giving up 52.4 points per game. LSU got off to a hot start as Angel Reese, Flau'jae Johnson and Mikaylah Williams each scored double-digits in the first half. LSU led by 13 at halftime, but the Rebs implemented its press, trap defense coming out of the locker room and it worked. the Tigers couldn't regain their footing on offense, managing just 17 points and giving the ball away six times in the third quarter as Ole Miss stormed back into the game at 67-62. Point guard Hailey Van Lith struggled to handle the press and picked up four fouls by late in the third quarter. But the Tigers rebounded, outscoring the Rebels 17-11 to pull away. Kim Mulkey's star freshman Mikaylah Williams continues to shine How would WIlliams handle her first SEC road game? The freshman emphatically and quickly answered that question. As has been the case her freshman campaign thus far, Williams was not rattled by the record-sized crowd at Ole Miss as she led poured in 18 points, including nailing four 3's. She snapped LSU's scoring drought in the third when the team needed it.

LSU's outside shooting provides enough cushion early The Tigers made five of their first seven 3-pointers in the first half, helping them build a 13-point lead. While Ole Miss claimed the lead early in the third, but Williams and Van Lith shooting the ball early efficiency paved the way for LSU to survive.
