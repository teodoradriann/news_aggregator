    "text": "dpa international Identity theft: Seven tips to defeat online fraudsters DPA December 29, 2023 at 6:13 AM · 3 min read Link Copied Read full article Cybercriminals are constantly coming up with new scams. That means it is all the more important to protect yourself against fraudsters. Franziska Gabbert/dpa\nIt's not possible to completely prevent personal and sensitive data from falling into the hands of cybercriminals. In the event of a data leak due to a hacker attack, often the only thing left for you to do is change affected passwords as quickly as possible.\nHowever, there's a number of measures you can put in place beforehand, to protect your data from phishing attacks and other scams.\nHere are seven tips from the European Consumer Centre:\n1. Pass on as little data as possible and always consider what sensitive information is really needed when using an online service. Be suspicious.\n2. Don't fall for phishing or smishing messages, attempts to get you to reveal personal data via email or text. Using all sorts of tricks such as sending out fictitious deadlines or threats to block your account, scammers seek to lure you to websites where they can steal your sensitive data such as contact information, credit card numbers or passwords.\n3. Instead of clicking in dubious messages that claim to come from legitimate companies, enter the address of the alleged sender manually, log in, and check your customer account to see if there any messages for you there. Alternatively, you can call the supposed sender on their official number and ask them if they’ve sent you a message.\n4. If you get an urgent request from a friend or relative via social media, often connected with a hair-raising or sad story, it's very likely that that person's account has been hacked. So don't react, click on anything or transfer money. Instead contact your friend or relative using another method.\n5. If possible, don't pass on copies, photos or scans of your identification documents. If this becomes unavoidable at some point, you should carefully black out all information that isn't required or that's irrelevant, such as your ID number and signature.\nYou can also add a watermark to the image file using a free image editor such as Gimp. It allows you to add a text band over the image stating the purpose of the copy, the recipient, and the date. The text should also state that the image is a copy.\n6. Each online service or account requires a strong, individual password. The easiest way to manage your passwords is a password manager program. Wherever possible, activate two-factor authentication (2FA).\n7. In the interests of security, software always needs to be kept updated. That applies to operating systems, programs as well as apps. If updates are available, don't hesitate to install them. Otherwise, possible security gaps remain open to external attacks.\nIf you notice suspicious movements in one of your accounts, act quickly to prevent further damage. You should report it to the police and inform your bank to block any pending debits.\nYou should also object to unauthorised credit card payments to receive your money back. If necessary, have accounts or payment cards blocked or apply for a new ID card.\nView comments",

    "text": "A Fertile Plot of Land at Franklin First United Methodist Church Is Nurturing Its Neighbors\nIn 2007, Franklin First United Methodist Church purchased 107 acres on which to build their new church campus. But before the bricks were in place, a pumpkin seed was planted. Those pumpkins brought joy to our children but it seemed God had a bigger plan – to grow a garden. The Giving Garden was then born.\nThe garden, on a 7-acre portion of the church's land, produces around 20,000 pounds of produce annually, which is then given to nonprofits in the area. The weekly distribution of this produce has enabled Franklin First to learn about their partners and build relationships beyond produce. These relationships include the Franklin Farmers Market, where volunteers gather unsold produce and redistribute it to homes facing food insecurity. They distribute food to\nThe Healing House, a residential center for women in treatment, where a former resident serves on the board. Volunteers cut hundreds of flowers from the flower and herb garden for arrangements donated to Meal on Wheels.\nOn Wednesday nights in the summer, the garden hosts an old fashioned potluck where non-gardeners join in the fellowship and might just stay around for a pea shelling good time.\nThe Giving Garden is solely dependent on the generosity of volunteers from the church and community. Many participants in the Master Gardener program dedicate hours in the garden, as well as high school students needing to fulfill community service hours, youth groups on summer mission, and business organizations wishing to serve the community.\nThe Giving Garden has evolved and grown since that first pumpkin seed, but it has always been and remains to be ‘a garden about people’ in relationship with each other and our community.\nLearn more at\nfranklinfumc.org or contact the church office at 615.794.2734",

    "text": "By Marisa Losciale ,\n1 hours ago\nPhil Collins is laying out his reasons for retiring from the drums two years ago in a raw new interview.\nIn the documentary Phil Collins: Drummer First , which premiered on Wednesday, the eight-time Grammy winner offered intimate details and new insight into his decades-long career, revealing the real reason he had to step away from the kit.\n🤩🤩 SIGN UP for Parade's Trending News newsletter & we'll keep you in the know on the viral pop culture moments & celebrity news everyone is talking about 🗞️🗞️\nDuring interviews conducted shortly after Collins announced he was retiring from music in March 2022, he revealed that his decision to put the sticks down—a skill he's practiced since he was about 5—was driven by health reasons.\n\"I'm 71, I've been playing drums all my life,\" he said in the doc. \"To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock.\"\n\"It’s still kind of sinking in a bit,\" he admitted.\n\"The drumming has taken its toll on my hands, legs,\" the \"You'll Be in My Heart\" artist shared. \"I just feel like I've used up all my air miles,\" Collins, now 73, later joked.\nIn the Dec. 18 release , the Genesis musician's 23-year-old son, Nic Collins , went into detail about the injuries his father sustained from 50 years of touring. The ailments included back issues over the years followed by a \"big surgery on his neck [in 2015] that stemmed from all those years playing drums and bad posture.\"\nIt also \"caused him to have a drop-foot,\" Nic said, explaining that his father \"has like no sensation\" and lacks \"control\" over his feet, which is why he \"can't really play drums\" and now walks with a cane.\n\"If I can't do what I did as well as I did it, I'd rather relax and not do anything,\" the English musician concluded elsewhere in the documentary. \"If I wake up one day and I can hold a pair of drumsticks, then I will have a crack at it.\"\nPhil Collins: Drummer First is now streaming on YouTube.\nNext: U2’s Larry Mullen Jr. Reveals Health Diagnosis That Makes Him \"Look Pained\" While Drumming\n2",

    "text": "SAN ANTONIO — The start of the new year brought another reason to celebrate for the San Antonio Zoo: the facility's first-ever birth of a babirusa, a name that translates literally to \"pig deer\" in Malay. The baby animal – its name and gender not yet announced – was born to parent babirusas Sula and Kreacher, and represents \"a significant milestone for both the zoo and the conservation efforts of this vulnerable species,\" the zoo said in a statement. Known for their curved tusks, the babirusa is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as \"vulnerable,\" one level away from endangered. One reason for the species' status: Mothers tend to only birth one or two piglets at a time, zoo officials said, while crediting Sula for \"her maternal instincts.\" Native to Indonesia, babirusas can grow to weigh up to 220 pounds as adults, according to the San Diego Zoo. Their \"barrel-shaped bodies\" are covered with bristly skin that makes them appear hairless, but it's their odd-looking tusks, particularly on male babirusas, that are their most distinctive feature. They can live up to 10 years in the wild, but up to 24 in proper human care. The San Antonio Zoo's initial Instagram post [announcing the babirusa's birth](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1kgmNExP87/?img_index=1) has received dozens of congratulatory comments and thousands of likes, with one user writing: \"I don't know what that is, but I love them both.\" While it's yet to be announced when the baby \"deer-pig\" will meet human visitors for the first time, the zoo shared footage of the six-day old piglet frolicking around in hay and getting used to his surroundings. \"While some may describe these little ones as 'ugly babies,' we can't help but find them irresistibly adorable with their unique and unconventional charm,\" San Antonio Zoo CEO Tim Morrow said in a release. \"We can't wait for the public to fall in love with this precious little babirusa.\" For the foreseeable future, zoo officials say the animal will spend time bonding with its mother to ensure \"a strong foundation for its future.\" >TRENDING ON KENS 5 YOUTUBE:",

    "text": "Que et mengis els dotze raïms a temps i sense ennuegar-te. Que comencis l’any a l’hora que vulguis però amb un somriure. Que et tornin els diners que t’has gastat en la loteria. Que els Reis et portin la il·lusió de quan tenies cinc anys i els anaves a esperar amb el fanalet encès. Que et pugin el sou perquè t’ho mereixes i la feina ben feta s’ha de recompensar. Que quan t’aixequis al matí els genolls no et facin mal. Ni l’esquena, ni el maluc, ni el braç, ni les cervicals (però que segueixis viu). Que trobis lloc a la platja per posar la tovallola un dia d’agost. Que et preguntin com estàs, però que t’ho preguntin de veritat, amb interès. I que tu sàpigues respondre de veritat com estàs i no et quedis amb el «bé, com sempre, anar fent». Que aquella amiga que fa temps que no veus es presenti un dia a la feina per fer-te una abraçada. Que t’adonis que estaves equivocat en alguna cosa i ho puguis rectificar. Que et diguin que tornes a somriure com ho feies abans. Que aquella pena que penses que mai es curarà es vagi difuminant i, un dia, t’adonis que hi pots conviure. Que t’expliquin històries com si fossin contes de les mil i una nits: divertides, entretingudes i sorprenents. Que aquell dia que el món se t’ensorra tinguis la certesa que tens a prop teu persones que et recolliran i et faran costat i t’acompanyaran fins que puguis tornar a aixecar-te. Que el dia que el món se li ensorri a una persona que estimes sàpigues estar al seu costat. Que et mogui més l’amor que no pas l’odi. Que, com deia August, el protagonista de Wonder, si has d’escollir entre ser amable i tenir raó, elegeixis ser amable. Que un dilluns puguis entrar més tard a treballar. Que gaudeixis d’un vespre sense ningú més que tu a casa. Que t’atreveixis a fer allò que fa tant de temps que tens ganes de fer però no acabes de trobar el moment. Que tinguis temps per perdre. Que superis alguna de les teves pors, i que te n’enorgulleixis. Que tinguis converses que t’obrin la ment. Que algú, un dia, s’adoni de tots els esforços que fas per tirar endavant. Que trobis la manera de perdonar allò que fa tant de temps que arrossegues com una llosa. Que trobis aparcament a la primera. Que les males notícies siguin fàcilment relatibitzables. Que algun matí puguis dormir fins que el cor et digui prou. Que a aquella persona que sempre busca la manera de putejar-te li posin una multa per excés de velocitat. Que deixis de preocupar-te tant pel què pensaran els altres. Que quan necessitis hora per anar al metge te la donin la mateixa setmana. Que sempre trobis una mà que apreti la teva, encara que sigui en la distància. Que sentis orgull dels actes dels teus fills. Que aprenguis d’una vegada a veure el got mig ple enlloc de mig buit (que ja comences a tenir una edat). Que, si t’has de morir, la mort t’enganxi fent la migdiada i somniant coses boniques. Que no t’oblidis de dir «bon dia», «gràcies», «de res» i «siusplau», i que no deixis cap «t’estimo» per dir. [](https://elmeucompte.diaridegirona.cat/tp/login) [](/)",

    "text": "Experts say US plans for lunar nuclear reactor are ‘cock-eyed’\nNasa aims to have the reactor ready for launch by the early 2030s, but little progress has been made\nFast-tracking a Nasa plan to build a nuclear reactor on the moon may sound dubious. Experts say that’s because it is.\n“The whole proposal is cock-eyed and runs against the sound management of a space programme that is now being starved of money,” American national-security analyst, nuclear expert and author Joseph Cirincione told the Independent.\nNuclear has been used in space since the 1960s. The US launched its first test reactor into orbit in 1965, and the former Soviet Union has sent up dozens.\nNasa says that a new 100-kilowatt reactor could be used to power a future base at the lunar South Pole, and fuel prospective missions to Mars and beyond. Nuclear would help to fill gaps in solar energy that occur when that side of the moon is in darkness.\nThe majority of space experts have said that placing a reactor on the moon is possible, so why is Nasa’s current plan “cock-eyed”? The problem is the proposed timeline.\nInterim Nasa administrator Sean Duffy – who also serves as US president Donald Trump’s transportation secretary – pushed to expedite the project detailed in a memo this week.\nMr Duffy said the administration wanted to have a nuclear reactor ready to launch by 2030. Earlier this year, China and Russia announced a plan to build a nuclear reactor for a lunar base by 2035.\n“The first country to do so could potentially declare a ‘keep-out’ zone, which would significantly inhibit the US from establishing a planned Artemis presence if not there first,” Mr Duffy said.\nNasa first announced in 2021 that it would put a reactor on the moon “within a decade”. In 2024, the agency said that their target date for delivery of a reactor to the launchpad was the early 2030s. But Mr Cirincione – who is vice-chair of the Centre for International Policy, a non-profit that advocates for a peaceful approach to foreign policy – says essentially no progress has been made.\n“It was in the last Trump administration that Nasa had put out a press release ... about how they’re going to develop these small, modular nuclear reactors for use on the moon, and it was going to be ready by 2026,” he said.\n“Oh, really? So where is it?”\nHe believes it could take up to 20 years for a nuclear reactor on the moon to become a reality. Nasa would need a working launch vehicle, a small and adaptable reactor, and the ability to land on the moon. Right now, the SpaceX Starship is the only option – but it has exploded during several of its test flights.\nAccelerating the [Fission Surface Power] programme could come at the expense of … core elements of Nasa’s public-serving mission\nThe agency has been working with Boeing on a space launch system – the main competitor to SpaceX’s Starship – but that programme would be cancelled under the Trump administration’s proposed cuts, which slash 24pc from Nasa’s overall budget.\nThere are also the scientific and technological advances needed for the nuclear reactors.\nThey must be able to withstand harsh conditions on the moon, including temperature swings from 121C during the day to -246C at night.\nMany scientists and nuclear energy experts have shared in Mr Cirincione’s scepticism.\nKathryn Huff – a former nuclear energy official at the US department of energy, and a professor at the University of Illinois – wrote in a Bluesky social media post that she’s not “bullish” on “unrealistic timelines”.\n“The 2030 target does not align well with recent budgetary trends,” Dr Huff said in a statement shared by the university. “Accelerating the [Fission Surface Power] programme could come at the expense of other critical priorities, including earth science, climate observation and space-based weather forecasting – all core elements of Nasa’s public-serving mission.”\nAlfredo Carpineti, an Italian astrophysicist, wrote in IFLScience this week that the proposal is unfeasible: “Even if we allow landing the nuclear reactor on December 31, 2030, the timing is really too short for something that must not have any faults if you want to operate it safely.”\nOthers were more optimistic about Nasa’s accelerated timeline.\nSebastian Corbisiero – a senior technical adviser at Idaho National Laboratory who leads the US energy department’s space reactor programme – told the Independent that a nuclear reactor on the moon is “doable” by 2030.\n“Nuclear reactor technology has been around for decades, so its well known,” he said. “Some key differences with a space reactor is that it needs to fit on a rocket – so there are mass and volume requirements – and that the system needs to operate in vacuum, so components will need to be built to survive that environment.”\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
