    "text": "Brasilia (EFE).- El presidente de Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, aseguró este jueves que “quien especule va a perder dinero” en el país y se quejó de los “cretinos” que atribuyen a sus declaraciones las oscilaciones del mercado de divisas y la pérdida de valor del real frente al dólar.\n“En estos días decían que el dólar subió por unas declaraciones de Lula y los cretinos no percibieron que ya había subido 15 minutos antes”, dijo el mandatario en una reunión del Consejo de Desarrollo Económico Social Sustentable, integrado por representantes de la banca, la empresa privada, sindicatos y movimientos sociales y que colaboran con el Gobierno en el diseño de políticas públicas.\nUn llamado a no especular con el dólar en Brasil Lula se quejó de que, “en este mundo perverso”, hay “quien cree que gana apostando dinero” con movimientos especulativos en los mercados de monedas o en las bolsas de valores.\nNo obstante, aseguró que “quien especule va a perder dinero en este país”, en alusión a movimientos que, en las últimas semanas, han presionado al real en su relación con el dólar y que, según algunos analistas, responden también a incertidumbres que existen en los mercados globales y las políticas de intereses de los Estados Unidos.\nEl presidente de Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (i), habla con el ministro de Hacienda, Fernando Haddad, durante la 3ª Reunión Plenaria del Consejo para el Desarrollo Económico Social Sostenible, en el Palácio del Itamaraty este jueves, en Brasilia (Brasil). EFE/ André Borges Esas oscilaciones han seguido en algunas ocasiones a críticas de Lula a las elevadas tasas de interés que mantiene el Banco Central de Brasil, las cuales se sitúan en el 10,5 % anual, con una inflación controlada en torno al 3,5 %.\nLula sostiene que esos tipos atenazan el crédito e impiden así un mayor crecimiento económico, y ha centrado sus quejas en Roberto Campos Neto, jefe del Banco Central designado por el expresidente ultraderechista Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022).\nEl líder progresista ha calificado a Campos Neto de “adversario político e ideológico”, pero también ha subrayado que el mandato del jefe del Banco Central acaba a fines de este año, y afirmado que una vez que el actual Gobierno lo sustituya “las cosas volverán a la normalidad”.",

    "text": "Gaming\nCall of Duty Warzone players claim it’s ‘worse than ever’ after Black Ops 6 update Nathan Warby ❘ Published: 2024-11-15T10:31:40 Activision Black Ops 6 content has arrived in Warzone , kicking off a brand-new era of the Battle Royale. However, so far, players aren’t impressed with the changes, claiming that the update is a “massive downgrade” on what came before.\nEvery year, Warzone integrates with the latest Call of Duty multiplayer , bringing shared progression and a boatload of changes to the game. This often means that each chapter looks and feels drastically different than what came before.\nArticle continues after ad Black Ops 6 is no exception, as it brings the omnimovement system as well as the classic Prestige progression system to Warzone for the first time. However, despite the many changes, players feel this is a step back, not forward.\nReddit user ‘iWant12Tacos’ called this new chapter of Warzone a “massive downgrade” before listing a handful of issues in Season 1 .\n“The graphics, movement, gunplay, UI, literally everything feels like a downgrade,” said the OP. “I wouldn’t really mind if it weren’t for the fact that they took away the Warzone of yesterday and forcing everybody to play this new iteration that’s worse in every way.”\nArticle continues after ad Article continues after ad\nMassive downgrade\nby u/iWant12Tacos in CODWarzone They weren’t alone either, as shortly after Season 1 went live, social media was flooded with posts calling out the update, with the new movement and footstep audio, in particular, coming under fire.\n“What did they do to Warzone? This is the worst version of the game we have had in years,” said one post , while streamer ‘ Tactical Grandma ‘ added: “I have never complained about a new season or map, but this one is hot garbage at the moment. No footstep audio, graphics seem fuzzy, movement feels clunky.”\nRelated: Warzone players claim it’s “unplayable” after MW3 launch Article continues after ad As pointed out by another popular Warzone streamer, IceManIsaac, one of the reasons that movement feels more sluggish is that many of the default Perks have been removed to match multiplayer. This means “slower gun swaps, slower mantles, [and] slower movement while plating/reloading.”\nThe devs decided to remove all default perks in Warzone because they wanted it to feel \"1 to 1\" to multiplayer.\nThat means no overkill, slower gun swaps, slower mantles, slower movement while plating/reloading, & more, unless you use a dedicated perk.\nDo you like this change?\n— Isaac (@IceManIsaac) November 15, 2024 However, although this explains why Warzone feels so different this time around, players still aren’t happy with the change.\nArticle continues after ad “They’ve ruined Warzone. I’ll never play again,” said one angry reply, before another player posted: “Literally the worst change they ever made.”\nArticle continues after ad Given that Warzone is now fully integrated with Black Ops 6, it might be tough for the devs to roll back many of these changes and make Perks like Overkill and Gung-Ho default again. But after seeing the backlash, we’ll have to wait and see if any adjustments are made in future updates.\nkeep reading Call of Duty Warzone players split on massive increase to lobby size Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players call for major changes in MW3 Season 2 and beyond Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players furious as Season 1 Reloaded update ‘breaks’ game: “It’s time to quit” Brad Norton Call of Duty Warzone players sick of “miserable” lobbies as they’ve had enough already Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone audio is “best it’s ever been” but there’s still one big problem Kurt Perry Call of Duty Warzone players call for massive changes as they’re already quitting Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players blast “crazy fast” TTK ruining MW3 Season 1 already Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players furious as “awful” audio is already ruining Urkzistan Brianna Reeves Related Topics Warzone About The Author Nathan Warby\nNathan Warby is a Senior Games Writer on Dexerto's UK team, also contributing on our sister website CharlieINTEL.

    "text": "The family of a 36-year-old man who died at a de-addiction centre in Vanagaram last month have alleged that the death was caused by torture, and sought justice.\nAccording to the family, the victim, Vasanthakumar, a resident of the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board (TNUHDB) flats at KP Park in Pulianthope and a carpenter by profession, developed alcohol addiction after one of his brothers passed away due to a heart attack. On the advice of a neighbour, they admitted him to the de-addiction centre. The centre collected a fee of ₹10,500 in first instalment, and without providing any preliminary counselling, forcibly took away Vasanthakumar from his house while he was asleep, and admitted him, they said.\nSureshkumar, the deceased’s brother, said: “We strongly believed that he [Vasanthakumar] would get reformed if he was treated at the centre. Our family members were not even allowed to talk to him over the phone. We were only allowed to talk to the staff, and they informed us that he would be home after a month. He was admitted on May 9, and on May 27, we received a call from the centre asking us to go to the Government Kilpauk Hospital. No more details were provided and the call was disconnected.”\n“When we went to the hospital, we saw our brother’s body placed on a stretcher. The injury marks on his mouth and body hinted at torture. The staff at the centre did not disclose anything despite our repeated queries,” Amala, the deceased’s sister, contended.\nBased on a complaint filed by Sureshkumar, the Maduravoyal police registered a first information report under Section 174 (Unnatural death) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The police told the family that they were awaiting a postmortem report.\nMeanwhile, CPI(M)’s Central District Committee secretary G. Selva submitted a petition to the State Mental Health Director, M. Malaippan, seeking an inquiry into Vasanthakumar’s death.\nAuthorities should monitor all private de-addiction centres to check whether they adhere to all government guidelines, Mr. Selva said, adding that a campaign should be conducted to sensitise public to the functioning of de-addiction wards in government medical college and district government hospitals.\nRead Comments Copy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "La pregunta sobre si estamos solos en el universo intrigó a la humanidad durante siglos. El cosmos, con sus 13 mil millones de años luz de extensión, nos lleva a pensar que, aunque sea por pura probabilidad, debe haber otros lugares donde existan las condiciones necesarias para la vida.\nPor:\nTN\nBill Nelson, administrador de la NASA, fue claro en su visita a la Argentina el año pasado. En esa oportunidad, en charla con TN Tecno afirmó: “Hay más de un billón de planetas como la Tierra, probablemente con vida”.\nEn las últimas décadas, la ciencia ha hecho grandes avances en la exploración espacial y contamos con observatorios de gran precisión que nos permiten observar el universo con una nitidez sin precedentes. Sin embargo, hasta ahora no hemos encontrado un planeta que reúna las mismas condiciones de vida que la Tierra, y mucho menos una civilización tan avanzada como la nuestra.\nA pesar de ello, no perdemos la esperanza. Gracias a estudios, descubrimientos e investigaciones, la ciencia logró identificar cuatro candidatos que podrían albergar vida. Estos exoplanetas presentan características que los hacen potencialmente habitables, como la presencia de ciertos elementos en sus atmósferas, una distancia adecuada a su estrella y características favorables en sus sistemas planetarios.\nPróxima b: un planeta potencialmente habitable a solo 4 años luz\nPróxima b es un exoplaneta que orbita la estrella enana roja Próxima Centauri, la más cercana al Sol a solo 4,23 años luz de distancia. Fue descubierto en 2016 y desde entonces generó gran interés por su potencial para albergar vida. Como se encuentra dentro de la zona habitable de su estrella, podría tener agua líquida en su superficie.\nPuedes leer la nota completa en\nTN",

    "text": "Profissionais locais conquistam certificação e ampliam oportunidades na economia do mar fluminense\nEm julho de 2024, um novo ciclo de qualificação técnica foi concluído no estado do Rio de Janeiro, marcando um avanço significativo na capacitação de profissionais para a economia do mar. A iniciativa reúne esforços da Karpowership Brasil, da Secretaria de Estado de Energia e Economia do Mar (Seenemar) e da Marinha do Brasil. Com isso, as comunidades de Itaguaí e da Costa Verde foram diretamente beneficiadas.\nA formação de 35 profissionais locais foi celebrada, enquanto outros 70 já selecionados aguardam as turmas de outubro e novembro, conforme agenda confirmada pelas instituições envolvidas.\nPrograma empregos azuis integra comunidade e setor marítimo\nA capacitação gratuita faz parte do programa Empregos Azuis – Um Mar de Oportunidades, criado e coordenado pela Seenemar. O objetivo central é ampliar a qualificação técnica nas áreas marítimas e, dessa forma, gerar novas oportunidades de trabalho, renda e desenvolvimento sustentável para o Rio de Janeiro. O curso, intitulado Curso de Formação de Aquaviários – Marinheiro Auxiliar de Convés e de Máquinas (CFAQ-MAC), prepara os participantes para atuar em embarcações de apoio e transporte.\nSegundo a Seenemar, o elevado número de inscrições reflete o interesse real da população por capacitação e emprego no setor marítimo. De acordo com dados divulgados em julho de 2024 pela própria secretaria, o programa se comprometeu a formar 105 profissionais até o fim do ano.\nO country manager da Karpowership Brasil, Gilberto Bueno, destacou que a iniciativa contribui para criar uma nova geração de trabalhadores especializados no setor marítimo, além de promover autonomia nas comunidades locais. Ele enfatizou: “Formar 105 profissionais com padrão técnico reconhecido é um passo fundamental para o futuro do setor e das regiões atendidas”.\nCertificação transforma vidas e amplia empregabilidade\nCom a certificação reconhecida pela Marinha do Brasil, pescadores e trabalhadores tradicionais da costa fluminense passam a ter acesso ampliado a funções melhor remuneradas nos segmentos de navegação, transporte e apoio portuário. A Seenemar ressalta que a ação fortalece a integração socioeconômica dessas comunidades, proporcionando novas perspectivas profissionais e maior segurança no trabalho.\nO secretário de Estado de Energia e Economia do Mar, Cássio Coelho, afirmou em declaração oficial de julho de 2024:\n“O programa Empregos Azuis – Um Mar de Oportunidades é uma política pública estruturante, pensada para gerar impacto positivo e desenvolvimento sustentável.” Ele ainda frisou que “investir na economia do mar é também investir em inclusão, trabalho digno e futuro para as comunidades fluminenses”.\nAlém disso, todas as etapas do programa contam com o acompanhamento da Marinha do Brasil, garantindo rigor técnico e confiabilidade ao processo de certificação.\nCompromisso social e desenvolvimento local\nDesde o início das operações da Karpowership no Brasil, a empresa adota uma postura de responsabilidade social nas regiões em que atua. O foco no desenvolvimento humano e econômico das áreas vizinhas à planta energética de Itaguaí é reiterado por cada ação formativa.\nA Seenemar ressalta que o Empregos Azuis consolida um ciclo virtuoso de capacitação técnica, geração de empregos e crescimento sustentável. Por meio de políticas públicas transparentes e parcerias estratégicas, o programa fortalece a economia do mar, valoriza talentos locais e contribui para a construção de um futuro mais inclusivo.\nOportunidades concretas com impacto imediato\nA estrutura do programa Empregos Azuis – Um Mar de Oportunidades, implementada ao longo de 2024, demonstra o compromisso do estado do Rio de Janeiro com a qualificação profissional e o desenvolvimento social. O curso gratuito oferece acesso a novas carreiras marítimas, incentivando a autonomia financeira dos formandos e, ao mesmo tempo, respondendo à demanda crescente do setor.\nOs dados da Seenemar e os depoimentos dos gestores da Karpowership Brasil e da Marinha do Brasil confirmam: cada etapa do programa foi rigorosamente planejada para garantir eficiência, transparência e resultados tangíveis. Com o fortalecimento da economia do mar, o Rio de Janeiro consolida sua posição como referência nacional em políticas de capacitação técnica para o setor marítimo.\nEm resumo, o programa Empregos Azuis se apresenta, portanto, como um exemplo claro de como a união entre poder público, iniciativa privada e Marinha pode transformar realidades, expandir oportunidades e impulsionar o crescimento social, econômico e profissional das comunidades litorâneas fluminenses.",

Na última segunda-feira (17), manteve a rotina de telefonar para a paróquia da Sagrada Família, na Faixa de Gaza, para se atualizar sobre a situação no enclave palestino. .",
