    "text": "> FRIENDSHIP — More than a ton of no-longer-used Bibles, Sunday school materials and other Christian study resources are on the way to pastors and missionaries in other countries as a result of a Friendship churches initiative.\nThe Traveling Chapel, a ministry of PhotosforSouls.com of Alfred, has been the depository for the items since October as the churches joined together to promote the outreach within the broader community.\nThe replica of a church has been parked on a small trailer on the front lawn of the Friendship Mission House, site of the former St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church at 30 E. Main St., and became an integral part of activities around A Friendship Christmas — Celebrating the True Message of Christmas hosted at various churches during December.\nDonors contributed 2,206 pounds, or more than 1.1 tons, of materials to the cause, according to Photos for Souls, raising the organization’s total collections are various locations in the Southern Tier of New York and northwestern Pennsylvania to more than 20 tons since the ongoing project started a little over two years ago.\nSuch materials are sought by pastors and missionaries in many countries which have little or no opportunity to obtain such items.\nPhotos for Souls also maintains a website of photographs and encouragement, with individuals or organizations being able to download the artwork, a large portion of which is of area and regional views, for their own purposes without any cost.\nA Friendship Christmas was initiated by community churches this year “to return the focus of the holiday to Christ’s birth.”\nActivities, many of them new, included a lighted nativity scene, along with The Chapel, on the mission house property, Sunday night Christmas caroling near the center of town, a Christmas concert by children and youth, along with some adult choral and instrumental participants, a gingerbread house competition, two Christmas Eve services, and a New Year’s Eve Family Celebration.\nThe churches expect to build upon these activities next year as they seek to expand upon their year-round efforts to serve the needs of children, youth, adults and families in the broader Friendship area.\nIn recent months, the group has hosted jointly a community picnic, a back to school prayer gathering, which has become a monthly event, several joint Christian holiday activities and a family day celebration and wellness fair. They also have supported activities hosted by individual churches.\nThe What God is Doing in Friendship monthly newsletter, which is distributed to church attendees and the public, has been developed, along with a group Facebook page by the same name.\nChurches also are seeking to engage a volunteer, or part-time or full-time children, youth and families ministries director for work within the community.\nFurther information about The Chapel and the Photos for Souls Christian nonprofit ministry, including a video that shows construction of the structure and its use, is available at https://bit.ly/3O2t208 .\nUpdates and reports about joint initiatives of the Friendship churches are available on the What God is Doing in Friendship group Facebook page or from Allegany Hope, the joint ministries facilitator, at AlleganyHopeWNY@outlook.com or (585) 664-9989.",

The demonstration was attended by the prime ministers of Burkina Faso - Apollinaire Joachim Kyelem de Tambela and Mali - Choguel Kokalla Maïga. Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali are part of the newly formed Alliance of Sahel States. The demonstration of thousands put an end to the sit-ins that began on September 2 in front of the air force base in the capital Niamey demanding the withdrawal of French troops. According to the agency, the demonstration was accompanied by concerts and acrobatic performances, and anti-French slogans were heard. The flags of Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Russia were visible in the crowd. In Niger, on July 26, a group of military members of the presidential guard mutinied and announced the removal of President Mohamed Bazoum. To govern the country, the National Council for the Defense of the Fatherland was formed, headed by the commander of the guard, Abdurahman Tchiani. Already on August 10, Tchiani signed a decree on the formation of a transitional government.",

    "text": "RESIDENTS OF CROWN Heights and East Flatbush clashed at a Monday online Community Board 9 meeting over a controversial new plan that would add protected bike lanes and other traffic safety measures to a stretch of Brooklyn and Kingston avenues between Empire Blvd. and Winthrop St., reports The City , with supporters arguing that the proposed changes would help reduce speeding around the area’s many schools, as well as protecting bikers. While opponents said that the proposals would increase congestion by narrowing streets and would result in lost parking spaces. Community Board 9’s neighborhoods currently have no protected bike lanes and only one shared-street major bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Officials characterized Crown Heights and Flatbush as dangerous traffic areas, with a total of 158 injuries reported from accidents in the last 5 years, 53 of them involving pedestrians or cyclists. The community board plans to hold another forum on the bike lane proposals in September, but has not set a date. ✰✰✰",

    "text": "La Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios (Cofepris) de México alertó este jueves sobre la falsificación y [comercialización ilegal de tres medicamentos oncológicos](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/nacional/2023/11/16/piden-medicinas-vacunas-mujeres-con-cancer-de-mama-acusan-suspension-de-tratamientos-desde-agosto-790188.html), dos de ellos destinados exclusivamente para venderse en Centroamérica. La Cofepris precisó en un boletín que la empresa Baxter identificó la distribución en México de Endoxan 1g (ciclofosfamida) en presentación 1 vial de 50 mililitros, polvo para solución, con número de lote 2C266E y caducidad en febrero de 2025 y que está destinado “exclusivamente” para comercialización en Centroamérica. En tanto, citó que Janssen-Cilag informó que los lotes DDP1255 para el producto Darzalex 400 mg/20 ml, así como EEF2466 y HHT5917 para Darzalex 100 mg/5 ml, no se encuentran en su listado, por lo que se determinó que estos productos son falsos. Asimismo, informó sobre que el lote MBS2H04 de Darzalex 400 mg/20 ml está destinado solo para el mercado colombiano, mientras que el lote LHS2649 fue desviado de la cadena de suministro original. Te podría interesar Además, la empresa Amgen México identificó la comercialización del producto Vectibix (panitumumab) 100 mg/5 ml, con número de lote 323473, caducidad en abril de 2024; 322580 y 11291 con fecha límite de abril 2023, “de los cuales no reconoce la importación, distribución ni comercialización”. Ante esta situación, la Cofepris afirmó que estos productos representan un riesgo para la salud, ya que se desconocen sus condiciones de fabricación y almacenamiento, “por lo que su seguridad, calidad y eficacia no están garantizadas”. Aunado a ello, recomendó que, en caso de contar con alguno de los medicamentos Endoxan, Darzalex y Vectibix con los números de lote mencionados, el paciente acuda con un profesional de la salud para que indique el tratamiento a seguir. Y exhortó a la población y a personal médico que si identifican estos productos evite adquirirlos y si cuenta con información sobre la posible comercialización realice la denuncia sanitaria correspondiente. En México, el mercado negro de medicamentos se estima que sumará los 32.000 millones de pesos (1.886 millones de dólares) en 2023, 78 % por encima de los 18.000 millones de pesos (1.061 millones de dólares) que valía en el 2019, antes la covid-19, según datos de la Unión Nacional de Empresarios de Farmacias (Unefarm).",
