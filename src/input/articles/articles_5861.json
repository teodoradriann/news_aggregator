    "text": "捷克鎖定吸引高技術外國人才 捷克通訊社本(2025)年6月9日報導，自本年7月起，捷克政府預計推動一項新的簽證政策，將透過調整駐外使館簽證配額，強化吸引外國高階專業人才，同時限制低技術勞工簽證機會。 具體措施包括：印度將新增 24 個資訊科技專家名額，並納入快速審核的「數位遊牧」簽證計畫；泰國的年度配額則從 300 人提高至 460 人，其中 100 個名額保留給技術專業人才。同時，捷克政府計畫削減來自部分非洲國家（如埃及、尚比亞與衣索比亞）的低技術簽證配額，但對非洲科學家與專家的簽證機會仍將保留。 整體而言，該項政策變革顯示捷克正積極調整其移民政策，將重心放在吸引具備專業技能的勞動力上。(資料來源：經濟部國際貿易署)",

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "[Community Corner](/rhode-island/coventry/around-town) Massive Solar Flares Could Bring Northern Lights To RI This Week The chances of seeing northern lights generally increase around the fall equinox, when the sun produces a surplus of geomagnetic storms. RHODE ISLAND — The sun fired off another massive solar flare early Thursday morning, further increasing the chances of seeing the colorful northern lights in Rhode Island Thursday, Friday and into the weekend. Thursday’s strong [X9.0 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841828583502700945), the strongest of the current solar cycle, followed Tuesday’s [X7.1 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841524465143841047), increasing the chances the aurora borealis could dip far into the nation’s midsection, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Rhode Island weather conditions may not be ideal for aurora chasers. The National Weather Service forecast partly cloudy skies Thursday and Friday night, but Saturday does look a lot clearer.

The sun is currently at or near “solar maximum,” the peak in its 11-year cycle when heightened geomagnetic storming [increases the chances of seeing the aurora](https://patch.com/us/across-america/sun-nears-solar-maximum-peak-more-northern-lights-displays-likely) far south of its Arctic range. Thursday’s X9.0 flare was stronger than the X8.7 flare in May that [pushed the aurora to near nation’s southern border](https://patch.com/us/across-america/northern-lights-may-dance-far-south-alabama-weekend) in a spectacular display seen around the world. Find out what's happening in Coventrywith free, real-time updates from Patch. “Flares of this magnitude in and around solar maximum are generally not common, although not necessarily unusual,” NOAA said in a statement on the social media platform X. But, the agency cautioned, “solar flares of this magnitude can be impulsive,” meaning they are quick to rise and decrease. Some last minutes, while others go on for a few hours. The chances of seeing northern lights generally increase around the [fall equinox](https://patch.com/us/across-america/when-1st-day-fall-2024-what-know-autumnal-equinox), when the sun produces a surplus of geomagnetic storms — almost twice the annual average — but this fall and the coming year should be especially spectacular as Solar Cycle 25 reaches its peak, which NOAA predicts will occur from November through March 2026. The ethereal curtains of pink, purple, green and yellow light have been seen in multiple U.S. locations over the past several months. The Space Weather Prediction Center’s [aurora dashboard](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) is a good site to bookmark for aurora chasers. In general, the best times to see the northern lights are within an hour or two of midnight. [Geomagnetic storms](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms) start with the explosions, or solar flares, of superheated gasses that can be as powerful as a [billion hydrogen bombs](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/space-weather/solar-flares/what-is-a-solar-flare). When this happens, the electron- and proton-charged magnetic particles hurtling toward our planet in a coronal mass ejection, or CME, can temporarily disrupt Earth’s magnetic fields, sending the oval aurora south of its Arctic home, but also potentially disrupting satellite systems and GPS and radio communications.

    "text": "Year-end holiday makers across China are bracing for possible transport disruptions after the weather bureau warned heavy fog and haze would shroud areas from Hebei province in the north to southern Shanghai for more than 24 hours.\nThe Central Meteorological Observatory issued its first red alert for fog since 2017.\nConditions were expected to improve from Saturday evening when a cold wave of air is expected to blow across the country.\nMore than 600 flights were delayed in various cities including Urumqi, Hebei's Shijiazhuang, Shandong's Qingdao and Shanghai, tracking app Flight Master showed.\nSevere fog was expected in parts of northern province Hebei, central province Henan, eastern provinces Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong as well as in the municipalities Shanghai and Chongqing from Friday morning, the National Meteorological Centre said.\nDense fog is predicted in parts of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai leading to low visibility of less than 200 metres, and less than 50m in some areas.\nIn the north, around the capital of northwestern Xinjiang region, Urumqi and areas between the Yellow River and Huai River, light to moderate haze is forecast, with heavy haze affecting Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Henan.\nThe severe weather was due to high humidity and poor atmospheric diffusion conditions, the forecaster said.\nChina has experienced a year of climate extremes.\nMost of the country was hit by a cold snap last week that rewrote records with sub-freezing temperatures, in contrast to the summer, when scorching heat that breached 52 in the northwest blistered the country.\nSummer storms also brought record rainfall to Beijing and flooding elsewhere.\nOn Friday, the central observatory told the public to tune into weather and traffic alerts, and advised them to reduce time outdoors.\nResidents in parts of Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu should avoid going out unless necessary, it said.\nIn Shanghai, some ferry routes were temporarily suspended and some sections of highways, as well as a bridge to a container port, were temporarily closed.\nIn Jiangsu, some sections of several expressways remained shut since Thursday evening, while Hebei and Henan temporarily closed segments of multiple highways on Friday morning, citing weather conditions, according to state television CCTV and provincial capital authorities.",

    "text": "Wales manager Craig Bellamy during a training session at Cardiff City Stadium. Photo David Davies/PA Wire. Craig Bellamy knows it will be a proud moment walking out to manage Wales for the first time, but has promised to remain unemotional to deliver a winning Nations League start.\nWales begin a new era in Cardiff on Friday against Euro 2024 quarter-finalists Turkey as Bellamy moves into a hot seat vacated by the sacking of Rob Page in June.\nHaving lost out on the job to Ryan Giggs in 2018, former captain Bellamy – a proud Welshman who won 78 caps for his country and has a tattoo tribute to the medieval Welsh nationalist and military commander Owain Glyndwr emblazoned on his arm – knew this moment might never come.\nAsked at his pre-match press conference what walking out in front of the fans would feel like, Bellamy, 45, said: “Of course it goes over in your head. It’s going to be a very proud moment.\n“I’ve worked hard for this and I’m going to recognise that. But that moment when the game gets going, I’m not paid to be emotional. I’m paid to make the best decisions possible on the side.\n“That’s the business I’m in straightaway. Of course I’m proud and I’m fully aware that the moment is going to catch me.\n“But it has to leave very quick because there’s a big responsibility and the players need me as well.\n“Being prepared for different solutions that could occur and being calm to make the right decision at the right moment. That’s what I’m looking forward to.”\nGood habits\nBellamy has promised good habits, positive body language and intensity from his players as minimum requirements.\nPage’s mantra towards the end of his three-and-a-half year reign, which came on the back of the team failing to reach Euro 2024, was that Wales were in transition.\nIt was a message which became loathed by supporters, who felt the presence of Brennan Johnson, Harry Wilson and others meant this was a team for the now, as well as the future.\n“I see a young team and a lot of talent coming through,” said Bellamy, who has included highly-rated teenagers Lewis Koumas, the Liverpool striker on loan at Stoke, and Charlie Crew, the Leeds midfielder, in a competitive squad for the first time.\n“But if I’m honest I see a very good team right now. The way I’m looking to try and play is a little different to what they’ve done before.\n“With the talented players we have, if we can tweak and adapt one or two little bits it will give us a huge benefit going into future games. All I see is a good group of footballers.”\nAaron Ramsey continues as Wales captain after deciding to prolong his international career just four months from his 34th birthday.\nInjury\nThe 84-times capped Ramsey has been blighted by injury and not played for Wales in almost 12 months, remaining on the bench during the Euro 2024 play-off final defeat to Poland in March.\n“It was frustrating not to get over the line and qualify, and not to come on as well (against Poland) and not have an impact. I didn’t want to go out like that,” said Ramsey.\n“I think there’s going to be a lot of success for this team and I definitely want to be part of that.\n“I think I can add value to that as well ahead of the World Cup. I don’t see any value in just playing the Nations League.\n“It’s all the way through now. I’m feeling good. I’m excited with the potential of this team.”",
