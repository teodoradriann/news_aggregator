    "text": "During hours of testimony on the first day of the trial for Brandon Letman this week, Ashley Spence’s sisters scarcely stopped crying as they sat in the courtroom. The tears continued to fall as more and more witnesses were called to the stand to testify in Letman’s case Wednesday, nearly eight years after 21-year-old Spence and 19-year-old Cameron Mounds, Jr. were gunned down . Letman, 31, is charged in connection with the death of Spence and Mounds in Hartford during the summer of 2016, following a scam trade of fake drugs for a fake gun. [A double-cross scam allegedly led to a fatal CT shooting. The man who got fake ‘cocaine’ faces trial] The first witness called to the stand Wednesday, Desrene Taylor, told Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Robin Krawczyk that on June 21, 2016, she rushed outside to find Spence shot in the driveway near her apartment on Enfield Street in the Hartford’s North End. Taylor, who also wiped away tears from her seat on the witness stand, testified that she heard Spence’s dying words. She said she remembered asking Spence what happened to her. “I got shot,” she said Spence replied. “That was the first time we ever heard that,” said Autumn Spence, Spence’s youngest sister as she rapidly tried to wipe away the tears falling from her eyes outside the courtroom. “She broke my heart,” she said. Spence’s older sister, Trevana Sumlin, said the hardest part of the trial was “having to live through some of the evidence.” Although the shooting was eight years ago and was considered a cold case until Letman’s arrest in 2019, Autumn Spence, said “it feels like yesterday.” Spence’s mother, LaTanya Sumlin, reached behind her to grip her daughter’s hand as witnesses walked prosecutors through photos of the crime scene on Wednesday, showing the spot where Spence lay dying in the driveway. She was rushed to a hospital but died on the way there, records show, while Mounds died at the scene. Letman is accused of shooting both of them and injured a third person after he and Mounds both duped each other in a drug deal gone wrong — Mounds giving Letman fake cocaine, and Letman giving Mounds a fake firearm, according to court records. After realizing the drugs were fake, an arrest warrant affidavit for Letman alleges that he returned to the Enfield Street apartment and opened fire on Mounds and others who were outside, including Spence, then he took off. “It was all for nothing, like for fake drugs? What?” said LaTanya Sumlin. Spence’s mother said her grief feels just as strong as it did after the shooting. “It’s been so long, since 2016, but it’s dragging on and it still hurts so much,” she said. “It’s like you lost your limb and you learn how to live without it.” While Trevana Sumlin said they just want justice for their sister, Autumn Spence said she doesn’t know if that’s possible. “I don’t think I’m going to get the justice that I want for her, I don’t think there’s any real justification after he robbed us of this.” The night before the trial began, Trevana Sumlin said their mother sent them a text message saying Spence was the glue that held their family together. “She was the glue, as the middle child she got in with the older kids, and she got in with the younger kids,” she said. Ashley Spence loved basketball and was attending college after graduating from Cromwell High School. She was popular, they said, and was always taking someone under her wing. “She was very social, she was the one who always brought someone home with her for Thanksgiving, even though there were already seven of us,” Trevana Sumlin said. For Lawrence Mounds Sr., Cameron Mounds’ uncle, justice came the day Letman was arrested. He said he plans to attend the trial in place of Mounds’ mother and father, for whom reliving the evidence may be too hard. On Wednesday, prosecutors showed the jury a photo of Mounds’ body covered with a white sheet at the base of a staircase by the back door of the apartment. When that photo was shown, Mounts Sr. hung his head in his hands and was visibly shaky. Michael Kuchy, then an officer with the Hartford Police Department , took the stand and said he was one of the first officers on the scene. When he saw Spence, he said, he “could tell that she was having trouble breathing.” He rushed to hand over an oxygen tank to another responding officer. “That’s when I was flagged down by multiple people, they were yelling that there was another victim across the street,” he said. Duchy ran across the street and found Mounds slumped in the back door way of a multi-family home. “He wasn’t breathing,” he said. “It’s hard to say … he was lifeless.” Mounds Sr. said that to him, it does not matter how much time Letman is sentenced to if convicted. “This is the closure part,” he said gesturing to the courtroom from the hall just outside. “That’s all I ever wanted. I don’t want (anything) else but closure.” “After this, I go to lunch, I go home,” he added. “I get to hold my children.” On Wednesday, prosecutors called eyewitnesses and law enforcement officers to the stand, each walking the jury through the events of the day of the shooting. Daquan Artis, known as “Quan” or “Little S,” was brought to the stand after being transported from the Department of Correction where he is in custody in connection to other cases. Artis has multiple pending cases in Connecticut criminal courts, including one in which he is charged with murder in connection to an incident in Hartford on July 19, 2021. According to a warrant for Letman’s arrest, a witness told police that they were with Mounds and Spence the day of the homicides when Mounds allegedly “wanted to trade fake drugs to a kid from New Britain in exchange for a .40 caliber handgun.” After they made the trade, they alleged that Letman and “Little S” came back to the Enfield Street house asking for Mounds. That’s when Mounds, Spence and Harold “Oink” Cook were shot. Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and shackles on the stand, Artis told a judge Wednesday that he had not wanted to come to court that morning to testify and that he did not remember anything from the day of the shooting. A statement he gave cold case investigators in 2019, however, told a different story. In part of that statement, Artis described seeing a man he knew only by his first name Brandon allegedly walk up to Mounds, raise his arm and fire shots. He later identified Letman in a photo lineup. Artis said in the statement that when looking at the lineup, he picked out “the guy I knew as Brandon from New Britain,” who he said he saw fire at people on Enfield Street that day in June. The jury saw a video recording of Artis sitting in a room with a detective, looking at the photo lineup from which he identified Letman. “I don’t know his last name but that’s 100% him,” Artis’ statement said. On the stand, Artis claimed that he only identified Letman as the gunman, because police were harassing him. When prosecutors asked him why his story changed, he said “because I was being harassed by the police over and over and I was told that if I didn’t cooperate with them I would be a suspect. Everything was false.” “You blamed someone else for a murder and you’re saying that was not true?” asked Krawczyk. “Yep,” Artis replied, adding “I went by what the streets (were) saying.” Cold Case Unit Inspector Douglas Jowett said on the stand Wednesday that police were not harassing him, nor going to his family member’s homes. On Thursday, witnesses included three women who were on Enfield Street when the shooting happened. They testified to seeing Artis and another man walking toward the apartment where Mounds was that afternoon. Then they heard gunshots ring out and saw Artis, the man he was with and other people running from the scene. One woman recalled seeing Spence lying shot in the driveway. “Everybody was screaming. They called 911 and the ambulance came,” she said, and then an older woman came out of an apartment across the street, screaming “There’s a body behind my house, there’s a body behind my house.” She said she saw Artis and the man he was with run away, but said she didn’t see either carrying a weapon. “I didn’t see a gun,” she said when cross-examined by Letman’s defense attorney. Later in the day, law enforcement officials testified about evidence collected from the scene, including blood-stained clothes Mounds was wearing and multiple shell casings. Letman is being held in lieu of a $2 million bond and is facing multiple charges, including murder and tampering with witnesses.",

    "text": "Cryptocurrency’s acclaimed rise has digital assets in the limelight. With over 10,000 types of coins , fluctuations and volatility in the market are almost certain.\nThe recent Kaspa price predictions look bearish, as KAS has a weekly target of $0.14047, and it now needs a huge 30% jump to cross that point, leaving investors pessimistic. On the flip side, the latest Tron price prediction fuels optimism, with momentum pushing it to achieve a $0.30 target.\nAs both coins navigate the volatile market, a new crypto BlockDAG BDAG is drawing attention. Its eco-friendly and sustainable X1 crypto mining app promotes inclusive mining. With over 500,000 users actively mining on the X1 app and over $199 million raised in the presale, BlockDAG’s the best crypto to buy and mine now.\nKaspa Price Prediction: Navigating a Bearish Market The current Kaspa price prediction has been negative, as it has incurred a 17% loss in the last 30 days, with bearish signals being waved to investors. The intermediate trend for Kaspa in the last 3 months was consistent with 30% drops. The long-term Kaspa price prediction is also no better, with last year summarized with a 40% drop.\nThe current Kaspa price prediction emphasizes to fulfill basic targets, it has to cross $0.1404, but it’s unlikely as the performance is extremely below that level. A Fear & Greed Index, which measures the overall sentiment linked, indicates that the Kaspa price prediction sits at an index of 44. The future of Kaspa is linked with lots of volatility, almost 14.42% monthly.\nTron Gears Up for Big Bull Movement In the last 24 hours, Tron (TRX) has climbed 3.01% to a value of $0.2430. Bullish activity now surrounds this coin. The TRX price prediction is being closely monitored, as a cross of $0.2470 could indicate a future breakout.\nIn the past 4 years, $56 billion has been poured into the Tron network, almost 10x the initial amount. As DeFi becomes more central and demanded, the TRX price prediction continues to rise.\nFighting off any short-term fluctuations, the long-term TRX price prediction is looking up. If TRX’s price crosses its resistance level, a reach of $0.30 would not be out of the question.\nBlockDAG’s X1 Miners Crosses 500K Active Users! BlockDAG’s sustainable-first crypto mining X1 app has crossed 500,000 users. A huge number of dedicated crypto-miners have entered the BlockDAG community. This is partly due to the X1 Miner app , which changes the game with its ease of use and sustainable crypto mining.\nCrypto-mining has never been easier or sustainable, but the X1 miner app makes this happen. The X1 app boasts a simplified interface, minimal onboarding requirements, and a large number of incentives. Users can mine 20 BDAG coins via the app, with just the tap of a button.\nThese are just some of the things making BlockDAG the best crypto to mine now. Using the X1 app to mine BDAG is extremely convenient and requires little effort, especially since it’s compatible with both iOS and Android devices and is only 50MB in size.\nAlong with BlockDAG’s X1 app, its presale has also been receiving heavy attention. The presale has crossed $199 million and it continues to grow. The prediction for the BDAG coin is that it will reach $1 once the mainnet launches as scheduled. This means early miners of BlockDAG will reap major returns, making it the best crypto to mine now. BlockDAG is pioneering cryptocurrency to a sustainable-heavy industry further solidifying it as the best crypto to mine in 2025.\nThe Best Crypto to Mine & Buy! Crypto trading is always linked with uncertainty. Established coins like Kaspa are falling victim to a bearish market. However, the Tron coin is actively pursuing a bullish breakout. But it is BlockDAG that is becoming a serious contender as the top dog in the crypto market.\nIts X1 Miner app makes mining available to all while being convenient and sustainable all the same. With a growing user base of 500,000 and a presale nearing $200 million, BlockDAG has serious momentum. Kaspa and Tron are relevant cryptocurrency conversation pieces, but BlockDAG’s disruptive mining app and accelerating growth position it as a particularly compelling project, gaining popularity as the best crypto to buy and mine now.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network Website: https://blockdag.network Telegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial Discord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#105](c105#c-105) cómo algo así conseguiría tal efecto?\nyo soy el presidente, acusan a mi mujer de delitos que demostrarse quedaría garantizado mi implicación necesaria , es decir, ahora mismo hay una acusación mediática, verosímil y que ha entrado en un juzgado de un caso de corrupción que afecta a la \"segunda dama\" y por extensión al presidente del país y lo que hago es decir que me voy a pensar si sigo o no porque todo el mundo sabe que si yo fuera inocente no tendría nada que pensar porque nunca se podría demostrar lo que nunca ha ocurrido. Al decir que me lo voy a pensar estoy dejando entrever que podrían descubrirme y todo eso lo hago para conseguir más votos en cataluña porque la gente vota corrupción, la corrupción da votos. Y me paso los cinco días haciendo uso del gabinete de abogados de moncloa para ver si la acusación de mi mujer podría o no prosperar y qué posibilidades hay de que me salpique.\nEs así el silogismo?\n[#60](c60#c-60) de hecho, el resto de España llevamos décadas queriendo independizarnos de Murcia, pero es Murcia quien no nos concede la independencia.\n[#115](c115#c-115) Cuando eres independentista estás enarbolando, por definición, una bandera. Aunque no te refieras a un trapo de colorines, te estás refiriendo a que cierto grupo de personas es tan diferente a otro que requieres poner una valla para que los de fuera no interfieran con lo tuyo.\nVamos, en última instancia, cuanto más independentista, más especialito te crees y de ahí a la xenofobia no hay ni medio paso.\nSe podría alargar la explicación pero si me has entendido antes, me vas a entender en esto. Tampoco tengo tiempo para expandirme ni creo que sea necesario.\n[#116](c116#c-116) No. No tienes porque querer una valla (como la de Ceuta, imagino que quieres decir). Ni tienes porque creerte superior a tus vecinos (sean estos, Marruecos, Francia o Espanya). Que puede que si, y ademas mola pensar que cualquier indepe es mala persona pero segun tu descripcion, la existencia de cualquier estado ya implica nacionalismo y por tanto, xenofobia. Menos el nacionalismo espanyol, que o no existe o es solo amor.\n[#119](c119#c-119) No me has entendido.\nPor valla no me refiero a necesariamente una barrera física, me refiero a que quieres dibujar una raya, sea literal o virtual, y decir que \"de aquí para allá no son los míos, de aquí para mí sí\".\nSi eres independentista es, necesariamente, porque te crees diferente. Va en la definición. Y si te crees diferente es muy fácil que te creas mejor. Puedes ser independentista y no creerte necesariamente mejor, pero diferente sí, y lo de que te puedas creer mejor es muy fácil, tanto más cuanto más independentista.\nYo no he dicho que sean malas personas los independentistas. He dicho un rasgo particular, una característica particular. Pueden ser independentistas y sin embargo muy de participar en actividades sociales y qué sé yo.\nYo no he hablado ni bien ni mal del \"nacionalismo español\", no quieras atribuir eso a mi comentario.\nRepito, si eres independentista eso se lleva mal con lo de \"somos todos iguales\".\n[#120](c120#c-120) Vale, entonces la unica manera de ser realmente no nacionalista es estar en contra de la destruccion de cualquier estado y cualquier frontera.\nCualquier otra opcion se lleva mal con el \"somos todos iguales\" y solo lleva al nacionalismo, y el nacionalismo lleva a creerte mejor y a la xenofobia.\nEs sencillo. Asumo pues que no existe nadie no xenofobo.\n[#16](c16#c-16) Ayuso, en la Asamblea: “Tú mata, que yo te daré una comunidad autónoma. Tú mata, que yo te daré un Estado”\n[#25](c25#c-25) Y seguro que pedirían escuelas en su idioma y pretenderían que el catalán es una lengua de segunda\n[#30](c30#c-30) Para nada. Todo el mundo tiene su escala de prioridades. Yo estoy con [#9](c9#c-9).\nHay gente que tiene otras \"Antes roja que rota\".\nSer indepe no significa serlo a cualquier precio. Igual que no serlo no significa no serlo a cualquier precio. La gente es relativista.\nSi te resulta contradictorio es que sólo concibes ser un ultra. De lo que sea, pero ultra.\n[#111](c111#c-111) Lo he entendido. La pregunta es porque?\nTu asumes que por ser indepe prefiere su pais a las personas, pero eso es tu propio sesgo.\nDe hecho es lo mismo cuando no eres indepe: prefieren todos la unidad de España a las personas?\n[#66](c66#c-66) definitivamente es innegociable y la tecnología, la ciencia, la política, el ejército se han desarrollado especialmente para proteger tal empresa. Porque básicamente dependen todos los recursos esenciales de los ciudadanos.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Nah, si a Cataluña y país Vasco la les hemos mandado charnegos y maketos a mogollón. Los tenemos colonizados.\n[#39](c39#c-39) A ver si dejamos de condenar a los judios por lo que hacen los sionistas por dios.\nQue no tiene sentido caer en el antisemitismo. Es vergonzoso.\n[#117](c117#c-117) Buen cambio de tema, pero no responde a lo que yo te he dicho.\nVale ya como referirse a \"los judíos\" cuando los responsables son \"Los sionistas\".\nVale ya con caer en el relato sionista de que ellos son los unicos judios y que todos los judios piensan como ellos.\nNo seas indecente.\nEl narco y el voxquimano se han quedado ahora sin nada que decir. Si eligen a Israel, tienen que doblarse con Cataluña y el País Vasco, si eligen ejpaña y mucho ejpaña, le tocan los huevos a los israelíes.\nA ver que dice el muñeco de esta salida de la diputada israelí.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Por que seguramente te has emborrachado de prensa propagandista de derecha y ultraderecha, en la que xenófobo era lo más bonito que se le decía a los independentistas. Y yo no soy nacionalista, ni español, ni catalán, el patriotismo es un sentimiento que a mí me parece inútil, que antepone la intereses de una élite, un trapo y una canción a las del pueblo.\n[#136](c136#c-136) Si buscas mis otros comentarios en este meneo verás que tu \"seguramente blablabla\" no es más que una tontería de comentario por no decir otra cosa.\nSi eres independentista es porque crees que eres diferente, y si te crees diferente lo que está claro es que no te vas a creer inferior, como mínimo \"igual\" pero diferente, posiblemente te creerás mejor, pero de todos modos lo que sí vas a querer es separar un conjunto de gente en (mínimo) dos grupos, los que están contigo y los demás.\nEs decir, te importan las banderas, ergo sí es contradictorio su comentario.\nPues a los gallegos y a el norte de portugal nos gustaria unirnos y ser una region independiente tambien. Si nos ponemos...\n[#39](c39#c-39) No son declaraciones con conviccion, son una amenaza contra el estado español dando donde mas duele. Ellos tampoco creen en la independencia ni lo cree ningun estado consolidado ya que seria echarse piedras sobre su mismo tejado. Lo que me resulta ridiculo, asombroso, hilarante, vergonzoso, lamentable (segun el dia) es que se lleven tan bien con los partidos españoles que cuestionan el holocausto y beben de la ideologia nazi.\n[#92](c92#c-92) Entre el fascio se entienden bien. Hay indepes de izquierda y de derecha, y sus modelos efectivamente distan mucho",

    "text": "La Secretaría de Medio Ambiente de Nuevo León (norte de México) declaró este miércoles contingencia ambiental hasta nuevo aviso en la zona metropolitana de Monterrey, debido a la mala calidad del aire causada en parte por una reciente ola de más de 239 incendios forestales y en terrenos baldíos que se registraron este martes.\nLa institución agregó en un comunicado que se recomienda evitar las actividades al aire libre, pues las autoridades han detectado altas concentraciones de partículas menores a 10 micrómetros (PM10).\nSegún la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), las partículas PM10 pueden provocar problemas cardiovasculares, cerebrovasculares, y la exposición por un lapso prolongado está vinculada al cáncer de pulmón .\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
