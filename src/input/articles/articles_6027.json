JACK GREALISH’S mansion was raided for £1million worth of jewellery by thieves on Wednesday night while the winger was playing for Manchester City. ARSENAL were left furious after West Ham’s controversial opener. Here’s what the pundits said: Moyes does a job on the Gunners to hit their title bid TOTTENHAM icon Hugo Lloris is set to join Los Angeles FC, bringing the curtain down on his 11-year stay in north London. WHAT a moment for 18-year-old Jack Hinshelwood, who opened the scoring in fine style for Brighton. SON HEUNG-MIN slammed Tottenham’s performance in their 4-2 defeat at Brighton and demanded they use it as a ‘wake-up call’ to keep their season on track. MANCHESTER UNITED could be without Andre Onana for up to four Premier League games after the uncertainty around the goalkeeper’s international standing was crystalised yesterday. IN Brighton, they will treasure 2023. A year when they scaled new heights, finishing sixth last season and taking the show on the road to Marseille and Amsterdam. When they partied into the early hours with Fat Boy Slim in Athens. Ian Ladyman IT’S the final column of 2023 so it feels only right to look back and, to a degree, forwards. So here are the good, the bad and the ugly of my football year. You will be pleased to see that VAR doesn’t even get a mention until the very last paragraph. JOHN STONES is set for more tests on the worrying ankle injury he sustained at Everton on Wednesday but Manchester City hope the central defender will avoid a lengthy lay-off. Lewis Steele JUST like that, we’re into the second half of the Championship season.

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "There will be \"real-world harm\" if Meta expands its decision to scrap fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram, a global network warned Thursday while disputing Mark Zuckerberg's claim such moderation amounts to censorship.\nMeta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's surprise announcement this week to slash content moderation policies in the United States has sparked alarm in countries such as Australia and Brazil.\nThe tech tycoon said fact-checkers were \"too politically biased\" and the program had led to \"too much censorship\".\nBut the International Fact-Checking Network, which includes AFP among its dozens of member organizations globally, said the censorship claim was \"false\".\n\"We want to set the record straight, both for today's context and for the historical record,\" said the network.\nFacebook pays to use fact checks from around 80 organisations globally on the platform, as well as on WhatsApp and Instagram.\nThere could be devastating consequences if Meta broadens its policy shift beyond US borders, to programs covering more than 100 countries, the International Fact-Checking Network warned.\n\"Some of these countries are highly vulnerable to misinformation that spurs political instability, election interference, mob violence and even genocide,\" the network said.\n\"If Meta decides to stop the program worldwide, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places,\" it added.\nAFP currently works in 26 languages with Facebook's fact-checking scheme.\nIn that program, content rated \"false\" is downgraded in news feeds so fewer people will see it and if someone tries to share that post, they are presented with an article explaining why it is misleading.\n- Zuckerberg courts Trump - Meta's policy overhaul came less than two weeks before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office and it aligns with the Republican Party's stance.\nTrump has been a harsh critic of Meta and Zuckerberg for years, accusing the company of bias against him and threatening to retaliate against the tech billionaire once back in office.\nZuckerberg has been making efforts to reconcile with Trump since his election in November, meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and donating one million dollars to his inauguration fund.\nThe Meta chief also named Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) head Dana White, a close ally of Trump, to the company board.\nAngie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, said Tuesday the decision came after \"extreme political pressure.\"\nThe move \"will hurt social media users who are looking for accurate, reliable information to make decisions about their everyday lives and interactions with friends and family.\"\nAustralia said Meta's decision was \"a very damaging development\", while Brazil warned it was \"bad for democracy\".\nMeta's move into fact-checking came in the wake of Trump's shock election in 2016, which critics said was enabled by rampant disinformation on Facebook and interference by foreign actors, including Russia, on the platform.\nrsc/hmn\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .\nTags Fact-checking Facebook Meta Platforms Mark Zuckerberg Donald Trump Politics Mass Media Misinformation Social Influence Controversies Feed (facebook) Public Sphere Human Communication Censorship Partners/afp Recommended for you",

    "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - The deadline for a major house bill banning gender-changing care for minors is in its final days. The bill would also prevent transwomen from playing on girl's sports teams. Local activists and politicians said they are waiting for a decision. If Governor DeWine doesn't take action, House Bill 68 could go into effect without his signature. So, the only option for opponents of the bill is for the governor to veto it. Even if it's vetoed, local republican lawmakers said they have a majority to override it. The Saving Ohio Adolescents from Experimentation, also known as SAVE and Save Women's Sports acts are sitting on the governor's desk. Republican lawmakers are hoping for DeWine's signature. But, the governor said he can't rush to make a decision. \"I don’t want to leave anything unknown, and I have the obligation to get as much information as I can before I make a decision,\" DeWine said. Republican Representative Adam Mathews, a co-sponsor of the bill, said the time has been well spent, and now it's time for Dewine to sign. If he does, Mathews adds it'll bring fairness to sports that isn't there now. \"Just like 13-year-olds have their own age limits versus 10-year-olds, we have men and women's sports because on average, there is going to be variation,\" Mathews (R) Lebanon said. The sports piece of the bill wasn't in the initial draft. It was HB 6 and later combined with gender-affirming care. Trans-rights advocates said medical options for trans youth are vital. \"We're talking about two different topics here. We're talking about sports recreation, and we're talking about life or death. That's big. Those two don't need to be grouped together,\" said PFLAG Cincinnati President Tom Sauer said. Children already receiving gender treatment would be able to continue it. That includes puberty blockers and hormone therapy. \"Those future kids won't be given the opportunity, and those future kids are some of the individuals that these major medical groups, like the American Medical Association, is saying they're going to need this care,\" Sauer said. Representative Mathews disagrees. He said the bill will protect children from surgeries that can't be undone. \"It recognizes men and women as both beautiful, but different and protects families [and] protects children,\" Mathews said. Trans-rights advocates said they'll try to get the law overturned if Dewine signs. Bill co-sponsors said the house has a veto majority. Ohio would join 22 other states that have a law or policy banning youth gender-affirming care. House Bill 68 only impacts trans-athletes playing on female sports teams.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\n*NSYNC reuniting for their first song in over 20 years was one of the biggest pop-cultural moments of the year, but it only made fans hungrier for a full-blown reunion. Member Lance Bass has been fielding questions about it since fans found out their reunion would be for a one-off song on the Trolls Band Together soundtrack.\nThis week, he gave fans another update after being asked about another reunion during the online game show Rent Free . “Look, we are talking about it — and I hope to have some good news, at some point,\" Bass shared per Page Six . When asked if we'd receive the good news by the start of the new year, Bass answered, \"Give us a little more time than that!\"\nIn November, Bass blamed the writers and actors strike for cutting *NSYNC's reunion short . \"We finally released a song after 23 years and we can't even mention the song and we can't talk about the movie it's in,\" he said. \"It was going to be such a special moment for all of us, and unfortunately that got sidetracked.\"\nHe went on to share a hopeful update with fans. \"But we had so much fun, I don't see this as our last thing,\" Bass said. \"Because of this strike, I feel like we owe it to the fans again to rectify this and do something else. But until the strike ends, we can't really even figure out what is next, if there's anything next. Hopefully we'll have a plan in place once this lifts and we're able to get back to work.\"",
