    "text": "The four suspects struck in the middle of the night at the store in Montclair, forcing their way in through the window. They can be seen on the video blowing right past a rack of clothes, instead heading right for the designer handbag that were on a back wall. In less than a minute, the thieves were gone. \"They were in and out in 40 seconds. So they knew where to go. Obviously we were scoped out beforehand because they knew exactly where to go,\" said Arlene Carrini, the owner of the shop. \"We had just done a Tiktok — we normally don’t keep all of the high end designer bags together.\" Get Tri-state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox. [Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.] The merchandise at the boutique is half consignment, half brand new. And while she didn't want to say what the exact value of the stolen bags was, Carrini called it \"a significant amount\" in lost profit. \"It was heart-wrenching, like I was punched in the gut. It’s such a loss that you feel,\" she told NBC New York. Carrini and her husband took to social media earlier in the week to warn the community. She said other consignment shops have since come forward with similar stories. News \"I would assume that they come in and they learn the lay of the land beforehand, just from what the detectives tell us and from speaking with other consignment shops who’ve reached out, who saw our post on social media, and said the same thing happened to them,\" she said. The masked men could be seen on security camera footage getting away in a BMW. The front window of the store was replaced soon after, but the shelves remain empty. \"I just would love to protect the retail consignment world and just forewarn everyone that they should probably come up with other security measures,\" said Carrini. \"I’m sure things will change but I don’t know how. Day by day, we’ll be doing what we need to do.\" Montclair police did not respond to a request for comment.",

He was reportedly let into the home after Gypsy’s late mother fell asleep and used a knife handed to him by Gypsy to stab the sleeping woman 17 times, killing her before fleeing to his native Wisconsin, USA Today previously reported. Gypsy later told [ABC 20/20 news](https://abcnews.go.com/US/young-wheelchair-bound-woman-treated-illnesses-ended-prison/story?id=52138979) she hid in the bathroom with hands over her ears during the act.

Este miércoles, la controversial derrota de Argentina ante Marruecos en los [Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/juegos-olimpicos-de-paris-2024-80507.html) dio la vuelta al mundo, y la [TV Pública](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/tv-publica-8300.html) consiguió con el evento una buena marca en el [rating](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/rating-919.html), si se la compara con los números que suele conseguir con su programación habitual el canal estatal. La caída de la Selección argentina en el partido disputado contra Marruecos en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024 por 2-1, consiguió un promedio de 4.1 puntos de rating en la TV Pública, la señal encargada de seguir las instancias del desempeño de los deportistas argentinos de distintas disciplinas que participan de la importante contienda deportiva. Además, durante la jornada de este miércoles la TV Pública regristró buenas mediciones con la cobertura de otras competencias de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024, obteniendo marcas que oscilaron entre los 2.1 y los 3.3 puntos de rating. Más allá de la atención que genera el evento que se desarrolla en la capital francesa, Telefe logró instalar tres de sus propuestas como las más vistas del día en el top 5, ya que Survivor: Expedición Robinson se ubicó en el primer lugar con 10.2 puntos de rating, seguido de Escape perfecto con 9.3 en el segundo puesto y Telefe Noticias en la tercera posición con 7.6.

    "text": "CARLYLE Each year E. Bourassa and Sons in Carlyle hold a toy drive for the local food bank. Although they already collected many items for this, they felt they could do more and wanted to do something different this year. The idea for a fundraiser was born out of the Weyburn branch being challenged by another business. Karley Hislop brought the idea forward to the group, and Carlyle's Bourassa branch decided to try a similar activity. On Dec. 6, the challenge began with Bourassa purchasing 24 items or more for the Carlyle District Food Bank, by which they challenged three other local businesses to purchase 24 items for the food bank and gave them 24 hours to bring the items to the branch. These three businesses would then nominate a business or two of their choice to do the same. This went on until Dec. 15 in the afternoon when the challenge was completed and items were delivered to the food bank. The challenge took off like wildfire and escalated into something much bigger than was anticipated. The organizers were overwhelmed with the success. Tina Renner, administrator for E. Bourassa and Sons said 63 businesses accepted the challenge with many of them bringing in much more than 24 items. Renner and E. Bourassa thanked all the businesses that took part in this challenge, making it such a success. Over 1,600 non-perishable and hygiene items were received and delivered to the food bank. The branch said they plan to continue with the challenge in the future as Carlyle knocked this one out of the park. E. Bourassa and Sons began their business in Carlyle in April 2018. The local office just celebrated its fifth year and now has 13 employees.",
