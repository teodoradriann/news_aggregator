    "text": "Un exjuvenil de River convulsionó tras un golpe en España y fue hospitalizado\nDurante el partido entre Mirandés y Sporting Gijón, en la Segunda División española, el delantero argentino Joaquín Panichelli sufrió un fuerte impacto que paralizó el encuentro por varios minutos.\nEl encuentro entre Mirandés y Sporting Gijón, por la Segunda División española, vivió un momento de tensión luego de que el delantero argentino y exjuvenil de River Joaquín Panichelli quede inconsciente en el piso, con convulsiones, como consecuencia de un fuerte choque de cabezas con un rival.\nLa jugada se dio en el minuto 18 del primer tiempo, cuando el argentino chocó con Eric Curbelo y luego quede tendido en el piso. El futbolista que milita en Mirandés a préstamo desde Deportivo Alavés recibió asistencia médica inmediata, momento en el que recuperó la conciencia y fue trasladado en ambulancia a un hospital.\nA pesar de la gravedad del momento, el partido continuó y finalizó con un empate 1-1, aunque los compañeros de Panichelli quedaron visiblemente afectados. El club llevó tranquilidad poco después al informar que el jugador estaba estable y bajo observación en el Hospital Santiago Apóstol de Miranda de Ebro.\nUn exjuvenil de River convulsionó tras un golpe en España y fue hospitalizado\n\"Nuestro jugador se encuentra consciente y las primeras pruebas son alentadoras. Pasará la noche en observación\", comunicó el Mirandés en sus redes sociales, llevando calma a hinchas y allegados.\nEn las horas siguientes, nuevos estudios determinaron que Panichelli no sufrió lesiones asociadas al impacto, por lo que fue dado de alta para iniciar su recuperación en su hogar. Tanto su club actual como el Alavés, dueño de su pase, le enviaron mensajes de aliento destacando su pronta mejoría.\n\"Nos alegra que todo haya quedado en un susto. Fuerza, Joaco!\", expresó el Alavés en un mensaje publicado en sus canales oficiales.\nPor último, el propio delantero agradeció el apoyo recibido: \"Gracias a todos los que me enviaron mensajes. Fue solo un susto. También quiero destacar el respaldo del Sporting y de mis compañeros, que ya son como mi familia\".\nEl incidente se resolvió sin mayores consecuencias, dejando en evidencia la rápida reacción médica y la fortaleza del joven futbolista para superar este difícil momento.\nMirá también\nArde el Gran Derbi: Sevilla cortó relaciones institucionales con Betis e hizo una fuerte acusación\nCómo fue el paso de Panichelli por River\nEl paso de Panichelli por la Reserva de River estuvo marcado por lo que fue su gran performance a fines de 2022, cuando fue el goleador y una de las figuras del equipo dirigido entonces por Jonathan La Rosa, cuñado de Marcelo Gallardo. Sin embargo, a sus 20 años, el delantero no firmó contrato profesional, el Muñeco se fue del club y, con la llegada de Martín Demichelis, decidió buscar otros rumbos en Deportivo Alavés.\nYa en España, el delantero aportó su grano de arena para lo que fue el ascenso del Alavés a La Liga, algo que derivó en la decisión del club de renovarle el contrato hasta 2029. De todas maneras, fue cedido al Mirandés hasta mediados de 2025, en donde hasta ahora suma ocho goles en 19 partidos.\nNo te pierdas nada",

    "title": "Meet Linda Tigani, NYC’s Antisemitic Director of the Commission on Racial Equity",
    "text": "Linda Tigani is the latest bureaucrat to be rising high in the diversity-equity-inclusion racket (NYC Division). She was recently appointed by New York Mayor Eric Adams to direct the city’s Commission on Racial Equity. When it comes to Jews her presumed commitment to “diversity-equity-inclusion” seems to evanesce. She has quite a history, caught on videos proudly uploaded to social media, of urging, chanting, shouting at rallies “from the river to the sea/Palestine shall be free,” which means, of course, that the one tiny Jewish state must disappear, to be replaced by a 23rd Arab one. More on Linda Tigani can be found in a story from late October; unfortunately, since then nothing has changed. “New head of NYC racial equity commission has spewed antisemitic rhetoric,” by\nNew York Post, October 28, 2023:\nMayor Eric Adams’ new appointee to lead the city’s Commission on Racial Equity, Linda Tigani, has posted antisemitic messages for years, The Post has found.\nHer views on the Israel-Palestine war aren’t so equitable.\nMayor Eric Adams’ new appointee for chair and executive director of the city’s Commission on Racial Equity has a history of spewing antisemitic rhetoric.\nLinda Tigani, who raked in $143,938 in fiscal year 2022 as acting chief equity and strategy officer for the city Health Department, has repeatedly shared posts on X that include the phrase “from the river to the sea,” which is call by Hamas terrorists and their anti-Israel backers for the eradication of the Jewish state.\n“FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA! PALESTINE WILL BE FREE!!” Tigani wrote in a July 1, 2020, post, which also included a clip from the “Day of Rage” rally in Brooklyn, where protesters reportedly chanted “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” in Arabic in response to Israel announcing plans to annex parts of the West Bank.\nTigani shared a video of a Palestinian artist and cook, along with a variant on the antisemitic phrase again in a November 2022 post, writing “Beautiful. From the River to the Sea #PalestineWillBeFree.”\nTigani has also shared a slew of posts highlighting Israeli attacks on Palestinians earlier this year.\nThe city’s appointed leader of its new Commission on Racial Equity has repeatedly posted antisemitic messages on social media.X @LindaTigan\nTigani has also championed Palestinians in the Middle Eastern conflict on her Facebook page, with her banner image currently reading “Free Gaza!!! Ethiopian for Palestine.”\nGaza has been “free” of Israelis since 2005, when every last Israeli, of some 8,500 who had been living in Gaza, left the Strip. Within two years, the Gazans were most unfree, suffering under the barbaric rule imposed by Hamas, the terror group which has ruled Gaza ever since. The people of Gaza owe their impoverishment to two things. First, the leaders of Hamas, most of whom are now living in five-star hotels in Doha, Qatar, watching the fighting from a safe distance, have long been engaged in the massive theft of aid money. Mousa Abu Marzouk has a fortune of $3 billion, Khaled Meshal has $4 billion, and Ismail Haniyeh has $4 billion. Just three Hamas leaders have helped themselves to eleven billion dollars. Second-echelon figures in Hamas have not been idle, either; they have grabbed a few million dollars apiece.\nThe second explanation for the wretchedness of life in Gaza is that the billions that were not stolen by Hamas leaders were spent, not on the wellbeing of ordinary people, but on buying weapons and constructing more than 1,300 tunnels that are 311 miles in total length, more than half the total length of the New York City subway system.\n“Ethiopian for Palestine” writes Linda Tigani. This is Tigani’s quaint way to signal that she is Afro-American. She doesn’t realize, of course, that the only Ethiopians who may right now be in Gaza are not fighting “for Palestine.” They are Ethiopian Jews, Falashas, fighting in the IDF to protect the people and state of Israel.\nTigani has yet to post publicly on her social media accounts in the wake of Hamas slaughtering 1,400 people in Israel on Oct. 7….\nNow that her antisemitic posts from the past have been revealed, she is likely to be very careful not to add more incriminating posts. I expect that from now on she will maintain a discreet silence about Israel and the Palestinians. But she’s left ample proof of her deep anti-Israel animus —and some would say, of her antisemitism.\nTigani and City Hall did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nWhat can she say? More importantly, what will Mayor Adams do now? When he appointed her, he was unaware of Tigani’s bigotry. I think he’ll do the only thing a sensible person can do, and fire her from her new job as Director of the Commission on Racial Equity. Don’t worry about Linda Tigani. Al Jazeera may well snap her up as a commentator on “Racism in America.” Or she could write a column for the Tehran Times. Or she could become an English-language journalist for the Palestinian News Agency Wafa. She’ll land on her feet, this Linda Tigani. Such people always do.",

A round a dozen of heavily-armed Spanish Civil Guard members wearing face masks entered the luxury home at around 6.00 am (0400 GMT), before arresting the man, who is believed to be part of a major drug cartel operating inside Europe and beyond and his arrest was part of the culmination of a three-year operation involving law enforcement from 10 different countries including Brazil.

    "title": "WSJ Reporter Evan Gershkovich's Case is Going to Trial in Russia – HotAir",
    "text": "Russian prosecutors said today that they have approved an indictment of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. He has been held in a Russian prison since March 29, 2023.\nAdvertisement The 32-year-old reporter is based at the Wall Street Journal's Moscow bureau. He was on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg, about 900 miles east of Moscow, when the Federal Security Service or FSB detained him. He was falsely accused of espionage.\nWith an indictment approved, Evan's case is referred to a trial court. He faces a series of secret, closed-door hearings. Evan, the Wall Street Journal, and the Biden administration deny that Evan is a spy. He is an American citizen and was accredited to work in Russia.\nHe has been held in Moscow's Lefortovo Prison where he is held in a cell for 23 hours a day. The U.S. government has deemed Evan as wrongfully detained.\nIn a statement issued today, Russian authorities claimed that Evan was gathering information on a defense contractor for the CIA. It's a false claim - he was on assignment for the Wall Street Journal, his employer.\nEvan's trial will likely take place in Yekaterinburg. The specifics of when and where have not been disclosed. There will be little or no due process in Russia that he would have available in the United States or other countries.\nDow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker demanded Evan's immediate release. They urged the Biden administration “to redouble efforts to get Evan released.”\n“Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge. Russia’s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,” they said. “Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime’s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan’s case is an assault on free press.”\nAdvertisement Sadly, Evan and other Americans are being held as pawns by Putin. Putin wants to use American hostages as leverage in the release of Russians imprisoned in other countries. The Biden administration doesn't have a good record in getting Americans released overseas and brought back home.\nJournalists are Putin's most recent hostages. Since Evan's detainment, another journalist was detained. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, 47, is a dual Russia-U.S. citizen. She was detained last year in the city of Kazan while visiting her ailing mother. Her detention has to do with proper registration as a journalist, though she and her employer insist that her paperwork is up-to-date. Russian authorities claim that she failed to register as a foreign agent. That is a designation Russian authorities extend to hundreds of organizations and individuals. She was charged with spreading false information about the Russian military. A connection was made between her and a book she helped edit that criticizes Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nPutin claims to be ready to make a prisoner swap to release Evan.\nThe Biden administration has worked for Gershkovich’s release. Earlier this year, the Biden administration explored a possible proposal to free Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, a U.S. citizen and a former Marine also being held in Russia. At a meeting in Washington, President Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed proposing to Russia a complex prisoner swap that would involve trading Whelan and Gershkovich for Krasikov.\nWhelan has been held in Russia since 2018. After a trial that was held entirely in secret, he was convicted in 2020 and is serving a 16-year sentence. The U.S. considers Whelan to be wrongfully detained. Whelan, his family, and the U.S. government say his conviction was based on false allegations.\nAdvertisement Biden and Putin are reported to also discuss the possibility of freeing Alexei Navalny. He was imprisoned in an Artic Gulag. The White House never presented a formal proposal to Moscow. A week later, Navalny was dead.\nThe Biden administration is inept and weak on the world stage. Putin knows it and acts with impunity. Putin wants to collect American hostages as leverage to swap for Russians imprisoned in other countries.\nJoe Biden has made the world more dangerous for Americans, not safer. Evan is the first American journalist to be held hostage in Russia since the end of the Cold War. We need a change in leadership in the White House.",

    "title": "Pédophilie dans l'Église : un ancien prêtre ayant exercé en camps de vacances dans les Côtes-d'Armor condamné à 17 ans de réclusion criminelle",
    "text": "Le procès d'Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, ancien prêtre d’Orléans, vient de s'achever. Il a été reconnu coupable par la cour d’assises du Loiret de centaines de faits de viols et agressions sexuelles, dont certains commis dans une colonie de vacances de Perros-Guirec (22). Olivier De Scitivaux, accusé de pédophilie, comparaissait devant la justice depuis mardi matin à Orléans. Le procès, très attendu, devait établir la culpabilité de l'ancien prêtre dans des affaires de viols et d'agressions sexuelles sur des mineurs entre 1990 et 2002. Âgé de 64 ans, l'accusé a été reconnu \"coupable de l'ensemble des faits de viols et agressions sexuelles aggravées\", a déclaré la cour. Elle a annoncé une période de sûreté de 10 ans qui va au-delà des réquisitions de l'avocat général. L'accusé a \"tout reconnu sans réserve\" La veille, devant une salle interdite et suspendue à ses paroles, l'ancien prêtre - renvoyé à l'état laïc à sa demande - a \"reconnu tout sans réserve\". \"Je reconnais, puisqu'il faut utiliser les mots, les attouchements, les caresses, les fellations, les pénétrations digitales et péniennes, l'ensemble des faits\", a-t-il déclaré. [A LIRE. \"J'étais un monstre\", l'ancien prêtre ayant exercé en Bretagne \"reconnaît l'ensemble\" des viols et agressions sur mineurs.](/bretagne/cotes-d-armor/j-etais-un-monstre-l-ancien-pretre-ayant-exerce-en-bretagne-reconnait-l-ensemble-des-viols-et-agressions-sur-mineurs-2975003.html) Suivant les réquisitions, la cour a également condamné l'accusé à un \"suivi sociojudiciaire\", \"une injonction de soins\", \"l'interdiction d'exercer toute activité professionnelle ou bénévole impliquant un contact avec des mineurs\", entre autres. \"Ce qui est frappant c'est que les actes, les noms (des victimes) font masse\", avait déploré l'avocat général. Des faits qui remontent jusqu'en 1982 Dans un rare exercice de confessions vendredi, l'accusé a également avoué, pour la première fois, des viols et agressions sexuelles sur deux autres victimes dès 1982 - des faits qui n'ont pu être jugés en raison de la prescription. Samedi matin, son conseil, Me Damien Brossier, a appelé la cour à la mansuétude soulignant que son client \"n'est plus un danger\", et qu'\"on en peut pas être condamné à 64 ans comme à 37 ans, l'âge est passé, l'usure est passée et du temps s'est écoulé sans infraction\" depuis les faits condamnés. \"La gangrène\" Les faits jugés remontent aux années 1990 et 2000 lorsqu’Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, ordonné prêtre en 1989, se lie aux parents de ses victimes, une fratrie de trois, s'invitant régulièrement à leur table, restant dormir dans la chambre de l'aîné, qui sera agressé et violé dès ses 9 ans. \"La gangrène, c'est Olivier de Scitivaux parce qu'il s'est introduit partout dans la famille\", a dénoncé l'avocate d'une des victimes, Me Clémence Lemarchand. A leur domicile, pendant que les parents dorment au rez-de-chaussée, dans les demeures somptueuses de la famille Scitivaux, l'hiver au chalet à Abondance (Haute-Savoie) ou l'été en colonie de vacances à Perros-Guirec (Côtes-d'Armor), celui qui avait à l'époque 22 à 25 ans de plus que les victimes (âgées de 7 à 9 ans) va leur infliger des violences. Devant une salle d'audience comble, dans laquelle de nombreux responsables de l'Eglise catholique et paroissiens ont pris place depuis mardi, les trois frères et un ami ont raconté à tour de rôle, avec minutie et pudeur, les sévices qu'ils recevaient chacun leur tour, sans savoir que les autres étaient également victimes. \"Quand il n'y en avait pas un de disponible, il y avait le deuxième ou le troisième\", a confirmé l'ancien prêtre, désignant ainsi les trois frères, des quadragénaires aujourd'hui unis sur le banc des victimes. \"Regardez bien ses mains\", a invectivé le cadet de la fratrie, \"ce sont dans ses mains que j'ai éjaculé la première fois, ce sont ses mains qui donnent l'eucharistie\". Le benjamin a lui raconté, devant une cour interdite, ces quelques mois où il \"y pass(ait) toutes les semaines, tous les jours, tous les soirs\", \"le moment où il a utilisé des outils sur mon corps\" ou lorsqu'\"il m'a rasé\". Des premiers signalements dès les années 80 Les faits se sont produits jusqu'au début des années 2000. Pourtant, les premières alertes sont émises par des animateurs et familles auprès du diocèse dès les années 80, des familles ou des animatrices de l'aumônerie en 1998. En vain. L'Église catholique est depuis des années secouée par des scandales de pédocriminalité dans le monde entier, et régulièrement accusée de fermer les yeux sur eux et d'ignorer les victimes. En France, un rapport rendu en octobre 2021 estime qu'en 70 ans, environ 330.000 personnes ont été agressées au sein de l'Eglise lorsqu'elles étaient mineures.",
