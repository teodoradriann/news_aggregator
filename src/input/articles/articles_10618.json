    "text": "MIAMI — Sabrina Ionescu had a wrap snugged tightly on her right hand at practice Thursday. Underneath the garment was a black splint to help support the Liberty star guard’s surgically repaired thumb.\nIonescu may not be feeling 100 percent just yet, but she was eager to get back on the court this week and join her Unrivaled teammates in preparing for the league’s opening weekend.\n“My first time going live was this week actually, so that felt really good,” Ionescu said after practice. “Little rusty but knocking the rust off a little bit and excited to just get live reps and knowing that’ll take care of itself as I play through this season.”\nIonescu underwent a procedure last month to repair a ligament in her right thumb that she injured during the WNBA Finals.\n5 Sabrina Ionescu #20 of the New York Liberty dribbles the ball during the game against the Minnesota Lynx during Game Five of the 2024 WNBA Finals. NBAE via Getty Images She said her recovery timeline was “a little sped up” because of Unrivaled, the new 3-on-3 basketball league debuting Friday in Miami .\n“If there wasn’t this going on, I probably could have taken a little bit more time of just rehabbing, letting it heal,” the reigning WNBA champion said.\nIonescu was fully cleared by her LA-based doctor Jan. 8 and plans to continue her rehab work while at Unrivaled. She also expects to play in the Phantoms’ season opener Saturday against the Laces.\n“I’m out here and getting live reps,” she said. “So everything’s going really well so far.”\nIonescu and Natasha Cloud were among the last people on Unrivaled’s practice court Thursday afternoon.\n5 Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu celebrates the team winning the WNBA championship during their parade on October 24, 2024 Getty Images Some of their Phantom teammates had already headed to the hallway and wrapped up their media obligations before Ionescu and Cloud were finished putting in extra work with coach Adam Harrington.\nUp until two weeks ago, Ionescu and Cloud had never been teammates. But at Unrivaled, the once WNBA foes have joined forces for two common goals: to win and improve.\n5 The schedule for Unrivaled. “For me, this offseason is really important because it’s when I get better,” Ionescu said as she sat in Unrivaled’s club lounge between Cloud and Harrington. “So understanding you kind of surround yourself with great teammates that are going to push you to get better but also a great coach, a player development coach that understands the way you play but ways that you can continue to improve on and that’s the most important for me, every year I’ve gotten better.\n5 Sabrina Ionescu will play for the Phantom when Unrivaled play kicks off. Unrivaled “This is kind of that opportunity for me to enjoy playing 3-on-3, but also work on my player development and be able to understand this is the time to do so,” Ionescu said. “Because by the time we’re done here [on March 17], we start up [WNBA training camp] really soon [on April 27].”\nIonescu was the last player to officially sign on with Unrivaled. Part of that was because she needed the surgery.\nThe other delay to her joining was because Ionescu, a Bay Area native, had already made commitments to other things during this offseason, including making an appearance at NBA All-Star weekend in San Francisco.\n5 The result of the Unrivaled draft. YouTube/Unrivaled Basketball But Unrivaled officials made it clear to Ionescu that they wanted her here in Miami.\n“Knowing I’m not going to be able to be here the full time and [Unrivaled has] been really accommodating, knowing that I’ve had obligations that I have to be at, and kind of being able to work through that with them,” Ionescu said. “I want to be here fully committed to my teammates and this team and just getting better as individuals, as a team, and that’s kind of the part that’s really exciting.”\nAnother added bonus to being here for Ionescu is that she has ample time to catch up and hang out with her former Oregon teammate Satou Sabally , who’s also suiting up for the Phantom.\n“It’s been some time since I’ve been able to play with her again,” Ionescu said of Sabally, who asked the Dallas Wings to trade her this offseason. “Obviously, three great years in college and now kind of being able to play together professionally is really exciting, being able to see her growth in this league … and now being able to join forces and being able to pick up where we left off in college is really exciting.\n“Obviously, the on-court stuff is cool but I’d say off the court as well, we’ve spent a lot of time together so it’s kind of nice to be reunited with someone you’ve kind of been through a lot with.”",

    "text": "The Pontine Marshes: From Malaria-Infested Swamp to Agricultural Hub The Pontine Marshes, a vast expanse of swampland south of Rome, were once a symbol of disease and desolation. For centuries, they were a breeding ground for malaria, rendering the region uninhabitable and hindering economic development. However, in the 1930s, under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, the marshlands underwent a dramatic transformation, becoming a testament to human ingenuity and ambition. Mussolini’s Vision Mussolini, seeking to showcase the power of his regime and bolster Italy’s agricultural production, envisioned the Pontine Marshes as a fertile agricultural hub. He saw the land as a source of national pride and economic prosperity. This ambitious project, known as the ‘Bonifica Integrale’ (Integral Reclamation), aimed to drain the marshes, reclaim the land, and establish modern agricultural settlements. Engineering Marvels The reclamation of the Pontine Marshes involved a colossal engineering feat. It required the construction of extensive drainage canals, pumping stations, and irrigation systems. Engineers built over 100 kilometers of canals, diverting the flow of rivers and draining the stagnant water. Pumping stations, powered by electricity, continuously removed excess water, creating fertile land for cultivation. The project also involved the construction of roads, railways, and bridges, connecting the reclaimed land to the rest of Italy. These infrastructure improvements facilitated the transportation of goods and people, making the region more accessible and attractive for investment. Social and Economic Impacts The transformation of the Pontine Marshes had a profound impact on the region’s social and economic landscape. The reclamation project created thousands of jobs, providing employment opportunities for Italians who had been struggling during the Great Depression. The establishment of agricultural settlements attracted new residents, leading to the growth of towns and villages. The reclaimed land became a major producer of crops like wheat, rice, and vegetables, contributing significantly to Italy’s agricultural output. The region’s economic prosperity also attracted industries like food processing and manufacturing, further diversifying the local economy. Challenges and Criticisms Despite its success, the Pontine Marshes project faced numerous challenges. The construction work was arduous and dangerous, with many workers losing their lives due to accidents and disease. The project also faced criticism for its environmental impact, as the drainage of the marshes altered the local ecosystem. The project was also criticized for being an example of Mussolini’s authoritarian regime, as it involved the forced relocation of local populations and the suppression of dissent. Legacy of the Marshes Today, the Pontine Marshes stand as a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the transformative potential of large-scale infrastructure projects. The reclaimed land is a thriving agricultural hub, producing a variety of crops and supporting a vibrant community. However, the project’s legacy is also marked by the human cost of its implementation and the environmental impact of its drastic changes. The story of the Pontine Marshes serves as a reminder of the complex relationship between human development and the natural world. It highlights the need for careful planning, consideration of environmental impacts, and respect for the rights of local communities when undertaking large-scale projects. The Pontine Marshes continue to inspire awe and curiosity, offering a glimpse into the past and a reflection on the enduring power of human ambition.",

Mexicali, B.C.- Dos armas de alto poder abastecidas con cartuchos útiles y equipo táctico fueron localizadas por agentes de la [Fuerza Estatal de Seguridad Ciudadana ](https://www.elimparcial.com/mxl/policiaca/2024/04/17/acumulan-agentes-de-la-fesc-6-denuncias-ante-la-fge/)(FESC) y del Ejército Mexicano en el poblado de La Rumorosa, en el municipio de Tecate. Los dos fusiles de alto poder, cada uno, abastecido con 29 y 25 cartuchos útiles, fueron encontrados dentro de un auto Nissan Altima gris, con placas de California, que fue dejado abandonado por los sospechosos tras una persecución. Los agentes se acercaron para hablar con el conductor, pero este decidió acelerar la marcha, generando así una persecución; luego de algunos minutos de seguimiento, el presunto delincuente perdió el control del volante y se embancó en una zanja. Posteriormente, el individuo huyó a pie y por lo accidentado de la zona y la oscuridad que se presentaba en ese momento, no fue posible darle alcance, informó la Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana de Baja California. Al revisar el interior del vehículo, hallaron un fusil de asalto AR-15 con un cargador abastecido con 29 cartuchos útiles de calibre .223, un fusil de asalto AK-47 con un cargador abastecido con 25 cartuchos calibre 7.62 x 39. También hallaron un arma Glock calibre 9 milímetros con cargador con 4 cartuchos útiles, un arma de fuego Smith & Wesson del mismo calibre, con cargador abastecido con 8 cartuchos útiles, otra Smith & Wesson, calibre 9 milímetros con cargador desabastecido, un chaleco antibalas con placas, un cargador calibre 9 milímetros desabastecido y un uniforme táctico con camuflaje verde tipo militar. También en Mexicali Por otra parte, en la ciudad de Mexicali, en un camino de terracería aledaño al Panteón Municipal No. 3, los agentes de la Fuerza Estatal de Seguridad Ciudadana (FESC), localizaron una camioneta Toyota 4 Runner de color gris y con placas de circulación de California. En el interior descubrieron un cargador de calibre 9 milímetros abastecido con 15 cartuchos útiles del mismo calibre. En los dos casos, los indicios asegurados fueron trasladados y puestos a disposición de la Fiscalía General de la República (FGR) con sede en la ciudad de Mexicali, autoridad a la que le compete llevar a cabo la investigación.",

And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home.\"\nWeinstein was the last American woman being held hostage by Hamas who had not been released, according to the Hostage Families Forum.\nPresident Joe Biden issued the following statement:\n\"Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judith Weinstein is also believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7. This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week's news that Judith's beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas. We are holding Judith and Gad's four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts. I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me. They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal. And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home.\"",

The BSF troops of 68 Battalion under South Bengal Frontier arranged the last glimpse for the daughter near Border Outpost-Madhupur in West Bengal on humanitarian grounds. According to the information, Aminudeen, a Member of Gram Panchayat Hariharpur informed the company commander deployed in BOP Madhupur regarding the natural death of an Indian civilian namely late Liyakat Biswas of Hariharpur village in North-24 Paragana (West Bengal) and further requested to arrange for casual contact with counterpart Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) so that the daughter of deceased residing in Bangladesh near the border can get a last chance to pay homage to the mortal remains of her deceased father before its disposal. Keeping in view the humanitarian and emotional aspects, the BSF said, that the company commander of Border Outpost- Madhupur, 68 Battalion, BSF immediately contacted his counterpart BGB officials in this regard without any delay. \"Following BSF's request, BGB also stepped forward keeping in mind the humanitarian approach.

    "title": "Opinión: ¿Qué impide que San Diego tenga viviendas asequibles? – San Diego Union-Tribune",
    "text": "Para aquellos de nosotros más afectados y profundamente involucrados en este trabajo, el problema de la vivienda asequible sigue estando siempre presente. La asequibilidad de la vivienda está en su nivel más bajo desde 2007, con solo el 11 por ciento de los hogares en el condado de San Diego capaces de permitirse una casa de precio medio. Esta cruda realidad resalta las disparidades persistentes en nuestras comunidades y subraya la necesidad urgente de tomar medidas para abordar la creciente crisis de la vivienda.\nLos legados de prácticas discriminatorias como la segregación residencial, la segregación, las brechas salariales, etc., impiden que muchos sean propietarios de una vivienda. Esa es la mala noticia. La buena noticia es que estas prácticas son provocadas por el hombre, al igual que las formas de abordarlas.\nSi usted es propietario de una vivienda, probablemente sepa que ser propietario de una vivienda no se trata solo de tener un techo sobre su cabeza; la propiedad de una vivienda puede fomentar la estabilidad económica y las oportunidades.\nBasta con preguntarle a Leticia Ortiz. Gracias a la oportunidad de comprar una casa de San Diego Habitat for Humanity, según Ortiz, ahora puede establecer un fondo universitario para su hijo pequeño, además de disfrutar de un espacio que pueden llamar suyo. Para ella, ser propietaria de una vivienda le abre las puertas a la creación de riqueza generacional. Cree tanto en este modelo que, desde entonces, se ha unido a la junta directiva de San Diego Habitat for Humanity.\nLa propiedad de una vivienda asequible consiste en garantizar que todas las personas, independientemente de su origen o estatus socioeconómico, tengan la oportunidad de alcanzar el sueño americano de ser propietarias de una vivienda. ¿Por qué es importante una vivienda asequible y alcanzable para todos?\nCuando los trabajadores de ingresos medios y bajos, como los trabajadores de la hostelería, las enfermeras, los bomberos, los artistas, los músicos y los profesionales más jóvenes no tienen que abandonar los centros de las ciudades para tener una vivienda propia, nuestras comunidades son más seguras y vibrantes, por no mencionar que los empleadores tienen un acceso más fácil y mejor al talento.\nLa vivienda asequible y la propiedad de una vivienda pueden conducir a mejores resultados en materia de educación y salud (incluida la salud mental) e incluso mejorar la participación cívica y reducir el gasto público en atención médica y servicios sociales.\nLa Coalición Nacional de Vivienda para Personas de Bajos Ingresos afirma que “aumentar el acceso a una vivienda asequible impulsa el crecimiento económico”.\nSin embargo, la construcción de viviendas asequibles no puede llevarse a cabo sin un importante apoyo de los socios de capital. Al aprovechar las inversiones filantrópicas y las soluciones financieras innovadoras (como el Fondo de Vivienda Asequible GoATL en Atlanta o LA4LA en Los Ángeles), podemos derribar las barreras a la propiedad de una vivienda y crear vías para el empoderamiento económico.\nEn este espíritu, la organización sin fines de lucro San Diego Habitat for Humanity y la firma de gestión de activos de impacto privado Mission Driven Finance anunciaron el lanzamiento de un segundo Fondo de Inversión en Construcción de Viviendas. Esta iniciativa, impulsada por inversiones filantrópicas y una garantía de préstamo del Banco de Infraestructura y Desarrollo Económico de California (IBank), está diseñada para acelerar la construcción de viviendas asequibles en nuestra región durante los próximos cinco años, teniendo en cuenta la propiedad de la vivienda.\nEl primer fondo, un proyecto piloto de 2 millones de dólares lanzado en 2018, respaldó la construcción de 27 viviendas en cuatro desarrollos, brindando vías tangibles para que los habitantes de San Diego adquieran una vivienda propia. Estas viviendas representan más que un simple refugio; encarnan la esperanza, la estabilidad y la promesa de un futuro más brillante para los nuevos propietarios como Leticia y tantas otras familias.\nA lo largo del año, mientras nos involucramos en esta importante labor, aprovechemos el impulso de nuestra dedicación compartida para abordar la desigualdad en materia de vivienda. Tenemos la oportunidad de redoblar nuestros esfuerzos para abordar las causas fundamentales de la crisis de la vivienda, amplificar el llamado a la justicia en materia de vivienda y defender políticas que hagan posible la propiedad de una vivienda. Queremos que todos los habitantes de San Diego puedan llamar a San Diego su hogar.\nEl gobierno, las organizaciones sin fines de lucro, las empresas y la filantropía deben seguir colaborando en pos de objetivos compartidos. Al tomar medidas juntos, podemos construir un futuro en el que la vivienda equitativa trascienda la legislación en papel y se convierta en una realidad tangible: un futuro en el que cada individuo tenga la oportunidad de prosperar y tener éxito.\nReed es presidente y director ejecutivo de San Diego Habitat for Humanity y vive en Oak Park. Nguyen es el director de inversiones de Mission Driven Finance, una empresa de gestión de activos de impacto fundada en San Diego que trabaja con socios en todo Estados Unidos. Vive en Carmel Valley.",

    "text": "Published: Sep. 5, 2024 at 10:48 AM AKDT|Updated: 3 hours ago (Gray News) - Ready for football? The NFL’s regular season gets underway Thursday night, with the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Baltimore Ravens. Betting on sports is now live and legal in 38 states and Washington, D.C. The American Gaming Association predicts that Americans will bet a record amount on legal sportsbooks this season, $35 billion, it announced in its first legal wagering estimate for the NFL season. That would be a 30% increase from the previous NFL season’s legal wagering estimate of nearly $27 billion. Tips on betting responsibly The American Gaming Association said it has been encouraging responsible betting . Here are a few ways to keep it fun: - Set a budget. Establish personal guidelines to know when to say when. - Keep it social. That means playing with family and friends to make sure it remains an entertaining activity. - Know the odds. Learn the details about the game you’re playing. - Play legally. Unregulated sportsbooks may not guarantee payouts and may put players at higher risk. Copyright 2024 Gray Local Media, Inc.
