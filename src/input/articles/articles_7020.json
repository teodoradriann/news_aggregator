    "title": "A strange problem on the screen of the Amazon Kindle Colorsoft is delaying shipments",
    "text": "Waiting until mid-December may be fine for some, but those who changed their previous e-readers They run out of devices. Even if customers decide to use the rebate to purchase a new basic Paperwhite or Kindle, they can’t take advantage of trade-in promotions because they no longer have devices to ship. Instead, they will have to pay full price. According to several comments on the Colorsoft product page on Amazon, customer service representatives have told customers that the original discount cannot be transferred to another Kindle. It doesn’t help matters that Amazon’s new line of e-readers is more expensive than their predecessors.\nWhat are the “defects” due to? The basic Paperwhite or Kindle works by applying voltages to electrodes that bring black and white pigments to the top of each pixel of the display. These pixels reflect ambient light creating a paper-like display. In the case of Colorsoft, the voltage applied to each electrode is different and requires color filters without too much light, otherwise the screens would be low resolution or dark.\nIn X, analyst Ming-Chi Kou suggested that the mishap with the Colorsoft screens had to do with the hardware . Everything seems to indicate that Amazon changed the optically clear adhesive (OCA) for a more opaque material. When the manufacturer announced its e-reader color, claimed that the coatings were “custom” formulated and would improve the color display, which many analysts and desperate customers strongly refute.\nWe have contacted Amazon to address these complaints and express our views regarding the mishaps in the display of the Kindles, but the company had not made any comment as of press time. For his part, Ming-Chi Kou believes that the company will lean towards a solution based on software although component suppliers have developed several solutions in hardware .",

    "text": "Skylights are gaining popularity in home architecture. A skylight is a roof window, usually made of transparent or translucent glass. It is installed to let in daylight and also for ventilation.\nArchitects shed light on how you can plan a skylight in your home design.\nSet a clear goal\nAman Aggarwal, principal architect at Charged Voids in Panchkula, underscores the importance of defining the purpose of a skylight. That is, whether you want to admit direct light or scattered light. Based on the nature of occupancy: concentrated, focused light works best for workspaces and museums as it helps people focus on their work, and helps highlights objects. At homes, where relaxation is key, softer and evenly diffused light works best. He says, “Minimal solid light works in libraries. Hostels welcome solid light.”\nThe design of a skylight is tailored to achieve the desired lighting effect, which depends on factors like the width to depth ratio of the opening (made for the skylight). “If the aperture’s depth is increased, only diffused light will enter. When it is decreased, the space will receive direct light,” he adds.\nFor a housing project in Chandigarh, he installed an array of skylights to allow both soft diffused light and solid light to enter at different points in the space. He says planning for skylights is similar to designing lights on film sets. They both are meant to attract attention to certain things.\nMind the size\nSkylights at a beachside Mangaluru home, designed by Vipul Soni, evoke the feeling of sitting under the stars. “Keeping the skylight as a continuous feature (without any cuts) was crucial to lend that expansive feel,” explains Vipul, founder and principal designer of Soni Vipul Designs, Mumbai.\nThe interplay of the horizon and sunlight is key to determining the size of the skylight. The direction, penetration, and path of sunlight are factors to consider. East-facing spaces get gentle morning sunlight while west-facing ones receive harsher afternoon sunlight. To size a skylight effectively, it’s crucial to understand these sunlight patterns, he adds.\nGo central\nKiran Hanumaiah prefers to instal skylights over courtyards or intermediary spaces with greenery rather than living and dining rooms. A home project he did in Bengaluru features skylights over a courtyard-like space. Such peripheral placement keeps the unwanted heat gain in check. It ensures that even in warmer conditions, the light will heat the walls and not the seating areas in living or dining rooms, explains Kiran, principal architect at Design Matters, Bengaluru.\nNaresh Medappa, partner of Mindspace Architects, Bengaluru, likes to add skylights to open layouts without walls, such as courtyard spaces. “This lets in natural light, which then diffuses throughout the open space,” he explains.\nFor a Hyderabad-based project, he added skylights to a Thotti Mane-style home. Such homes feature a central courtyard and are traditionally seen in Karnataka. The project features a courtyard linking lower and upper levels, with a large skylight dominating the space. Below the skylight is a false roof with square cuts, creating an abstract play of light and shade. The space between the false roof and the glass above features side openings in forms of louvers and mesh, allowing for airflow. Such a ventilation system works well in hot climes like Hyderabad’s.\nSkylights can be added to spaces that lack side windows to brighten them up, such as hallways and stairwells, especially in dense urban settings.\nSkylight options\nIn a project he helmed in Bengaluru, Kiran ditched the conventional direct opening for a coffered skylight. The skylight consisted of sunken panels arranged in a grid pattern. This results in a lively play of light and shadow at different times of the day and as seasons change. It is also considered a safer option against break-ins. “We use toughened laminated glass, similar to car windshields. In case of breakage, it holds together like a spider web,” explains Kiran.\nShalini Chandrashekar has integrated a smart skylight above a courtyard in an ongoing project in Kerala. It features openable panels, which can be controlled by a remote. It is also equipped with adjustable blinds and a built-in mosquito mesh.\n“With the touch of a button, you can open the entire skylight area, letting in direct sunlight or rain to facilitate the growth of indoor trees in the courtyard,” explains Shalini, principal architect, Taliesyn-Design and Architecture, Bengaluru. Such a design provides a controlled environment to nurture indoor plants.\nIllusion of space\nSkylights allow ample natural light into a space, creating a light well. This not only brightens up the interiors but also gives the impression of a more open area, says Shalini. She integrated strip windows at the ceiling-wall junction of a bedroom at a housing project she designed in Kerala in 2019. “There is a gap for light to come in between the wall and the ceiling, creating an illusion of a floating ceiling. This design creates a heightened sense of space,” she says.\nTransform ambiance\nSkylights can transform the ambiance of a space. For a villa project in Bengaluru, Naresh installed a skylight over a staircase. Under the skylight, he placed a wooden board featuring circular cut outs, which mimic the pots (for insulation) placed on the cool roof. The idea was to create an abstract pattern.\nDesign challenges\nSkylights are usually installed over courtyards connected to the living and dining rooms. There is an increasing demand for skylights in bathrooms now. Naresh says, “In such cases, a small courtyard near the shower area with a skylight on top is created. The court walls are raised higher than the other roofs, so that no one can look into the room. Frosted glass is used here so that light comes through, but visibility is unclear.”\nBalancing light and heat during summer requires careful planning. Architects suggest using high-performance glass that allows light in while minimising heat. Tinted glass is another option for reducing heat to an extent.\nWallet factor\nInstallation can cost approximately Rs 2,000 per sq ft based on the size and design.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 05 January 2024, 19:04 IST)",

    "text": "WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - A Wichita woman accused of shooting and killing her teenage son in January has pleaded guilty to the crime. The Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office confirmed Kylee Hodges entered the plea in the death of her 14-year-old son, Claude Hodges, Jr. Police were called to Aspen Park Apartments on January 29 for a welfare check. The teenager’s father, Claude Hodges, Sr., said Kylee and Claude, Jr. failed to show up for a custody exchange and he couldn’t get ahold of his son. When Wichita police arrived at the complex, they found a hole in the wall and a bullet on the ground. Following an hours-long standoff which ended up with Kylee Hodges being shot by police , officers made their way inside the woman’s apartment where they found Claude Hodges, Jr. in a bedroom dead from a gunshot wound. According to a probable cause affidavit , the incident may have stemmed from a custody dispute in which Claude, Sr. would have been given more custodial time with his son. Kylee is due back in court in July for sentencing. Copyright 2024 KWCH. All rights reserved. To report a correction or typo, please email news@kwch.com",

    "text": "SYLHET (BANGLADESH), May 2: A dominant India grabbed an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match women’s T20I series as they pummelled Bangladesh by seven wickets in the third match here on Thursday. After their skipper Harmanpreet Kaur opted to field first looking at the cloud cover and a mild breeze, India’s bowlers dished out another disciplined performance to restrict Bangladesh to 117/8, which the visitors overhauled with nine balls to spare. When they came to bat, openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma put on 91 runs in just 12.1 overs to take India closer to a series win. Shafali got out after a 38-ball 51, hitting eight fours, while Mandhana found form as she struck 47 off 42 balls with the help of five boundaries and a six. Ritu Moni took a blinder off her bowling to dismiss Shafali while Nahida Akter accounted for Mandhana. But the damage was done. Earlier, the decision to bowl first did not yield the desired result immediately, as Bangladesh raced to 44 for no loss in the six powerplay overs. However, the Indian bowlers tightened the screws on the home team batters after the dismissal of Dilara Akter, who blazed away to 39 off 25 balls. The hosts’ brisk start was largely due to the batting of Dilara Akter who struck a few boundaries and negotiated the Indian bowlers without much difficulty early on at Sylhet International Cricket Stadium. Trailing 0-2 in the five-match series, Bangladesh looked determined to give a better account of themselves and keep the rubber alive, two days after being shot out for 119 at the same venue. With the T20 World Cup around the corner, the objective is to finalise their middle-order, which has been having some difficulty. Even as Dilara kept the scoreboard moving at a fair clip, Bangladesh lost their first wicket when Murshida Khatun (9) was run out by the Deepti Sharma-Richa Ghosh combo. The star performer of the series opener, medium pacer Renuka Singh dealt a big blow on Bangladesh when her slower delivery on the leg side made contact with Dilara’s gloves on its way to Ghosh, even as the batter looked to hit it hard over the square leg region. The soft dismissal hurt the home team as the India bowlers looked to settle into a nice rhythm. (PTI)",

    "text": "Rafael Nadal has repeatedly struggled with injuries recently. Now his coach is talking about a setback shortly before the Olympics. According to his coach, Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal is worried about his participation in the Olympic Games in Paris. The 38-year-old canceled a training session with Alexander Zverev scheduled for Thursday due to a \"minor setback\", as coach Carlos Moya told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. It remains to be seen whether Nadal will be able to compete at the Olympic tournament. \"I can't guarantee anything. We have to wait and see,\" said the former professional Moya. The first match in the Olympic doubles with his compatriot Carlos Alcaraz is scheduled for Saturday. Nadal's first round singles match against Hungary's Marton Fucsovics would therefore take place on Sunday at the Stade Roland Garros. If the Spaniard were to qualify for the second round, it would most likely be a clash of giants with top seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian world number 2 will face the 36-year-old Australian doubles specialist Matthew Ebden in the starting round. It would be the 60th meeting between the 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic and the 22-time Grand Slam winner Nadal. The two tennis legends already played against each other at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Back then, Nadal came out on top after a thrilling fight. No grass court season Nadal has been struggling with injuries of late. The 22-time Grand Slam tournament winner had recently skipped the grass court season and prepared for the Olympics instead. Before the Paris Games, he returned to the tournament in Bastad, Sweden, where he reached the final. Nadal wore a bandage on his right thigh during training with his doubles partner Alcaraz on Wednesday. Moya said that he would now have to see how the condition improves.",
