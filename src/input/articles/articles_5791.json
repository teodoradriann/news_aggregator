    "text": "YEREVAN, 31 MAY, ARMENPRESS. On June 1, to mark the International Day for Protection of Children, AraratBank is implementing another program within its social responsibility framework. The Bank will donate children's prayer books to beneficiary children of the City of Smile Foundation.\nAraratBank has been cooperating with the City of Smile Charitable Foundation for years already, joining the Foundation in its efforts to treat children with cancer.\nThe prayer book is intended for children around 5 to 8 years old. From the child’s earliest years, the cognitive attribute of the relationship between the parent and the child is quite strong, and the child asks his mother plenty of questions, and it is the mother who acquaints the child with the world, provides answers and teaches him to pray in simple words.\n\"The idea of ​​ creating a prayer book for kids came up in conversations with my son. In 2020, he broke his leg, and even the strongest painkillers didn’t give him relief from the severe pain after the surgery. My son asked me to pray for him, and I started to pray, and the faith was so great that the pain was gone. One day, when I suggested that he should pray himself, I realized that my child didn’t know how to pray for his needs. This is how the idea of ​​ creating a children's prayer book was born. The book can become the first guide for children, the first prayer book that will teach them how to pray and, at the same time, to start a conversation with God. And since the conversation took place between my son and me, the book is narrated as a \"Conversation between a mother and her child,\" shares her experience Marianna Apresyan, Doctor of Theology, founder and president of Christian Women's Forum NGO.\n\"With this initiative, the Bank, under the Foundation’s auspices, stands by children fighting cancer and malignant blood disorders, promoting unity and hope. As a matter of fact, an intellectual team of eight employees, recently formed at AraratBank, participated in the \"What? Where? When?” charity championship a few days ago and directed the funds raised at the event to the treatment of children with cancer. This once again emphasizes the importance of the Bank’s commitment to social responsibility,\" notes Anna Allahverdyan, Advisor on Public Relations to CEO of AraratBank.",

    "text": "Man found dead identified as teacher accused of sexually abusing teenage girl\nBy Austin Ellis\nClick here for updates on this story\nDUBUQUE, Iowa (\nKWWL) — Dubuque Police said the man who died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound Wednesday was a teacher accused of a sexual relationship with a student.\nPolice attempted to serve an arrest warrant for 24-year-old Trent Paschal, who was a teacher at Thomas Jefferson Middle School. Paschal was alleged to have had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student.\nThrough interviews, police say they learned about inappropriate snapchats between Paschal and the victim. They also learned of two occasions where Paschal picked up the student and engaged in sex acts at his apartment.\nPolice said traffic cameras and surveillance footage showed Paschal picking up the student up on May 27th, going to his apartment, and leaving the apartment together.\nWhen police attempted to serve the arrest warrant on two counts of third-degree sexual abuse on Wednesday, they heard a single gunshot from the apartment. After attempts from officers to speak with Paschal were unsuccessful, they found him dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nThe Dubuque Community School District shared a statement with KWWL regarding the situation. The district said:\n“On Friday, May 31, the Dubuque Community School District received a third-party report of an alleged inappropriate relationship between Trent Paschal and a student. Paschal was a teacher at Jefferson Middle School and Dubuque Online School, and a coach in the district. There is no indication that the alleged inappropriate contact occurred at school. The District immediately began investigating the report using its established protocols, promptly placed the staff member on administrative leave, and engaged law enforcement in the investigation. At that point, the Dubuque Police Department took the lead on the investigation, with the full cooperation of the District.\nCentral to our work in the Dubuque Community School District is seeking to provide a safe learning environment in which our students can thrive. These allegations were obviously concerning and taken very seriously. On June 12, 2024, the District was notified that when the Dubuque Police Department went to serve the arrest warrant in the matter on Trent Paschal, a self-inflicted gunshot occurred, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. At this time, the District will defer to and fully cooperate with the Dubuque Police Department regarding its handling of this matter.\nAs a District, we continue to take the allegations very seriously while also recognizing that the loss of life is always tragic.\nOur focus now will be on supporting our students and staff through this difficult time, knowing that there may not be answers to many of the questions people may have.\nIn upcoming days, additional counseling support will be available for those wishing for additional assistance in processing these difficult events. Support will be available at Jefferson on Friday, June 14th from 10:00-11:30 AM for staff and 12:30-2:00 PM for students and families. Additional sessions will follow.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
