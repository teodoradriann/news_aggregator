    "text": "Cake shop owners charged with workplace slavery Abid and Aeisha Shah now cleared of all charges READ MORE: Talented surfer, 15, is named as the victim of horrific shark attack as details emerge of his final moments\nSlavery charges against a wealthy couple who run a popular chain of cheesecake shops have been dropped on the eve of them facing trial.\nAbid Maghfoor Shah and his wife Aeisha Julia Shah had pleaded not guilty to trafficking their Pakistani nephew and enslaving him for two-and-a-half years.\nMr Shah, then 59, and Mrs Shah, 48, were arrested at their $4million home at Denham Court in Sydney’s western suburbs in November 2021.\nThe Shahs, who own The Cake Merchant group, were accused of promising their nephew a better life in Australia, then threatening him with deportation if he did not work hard enough.\nAbid Maghfoor Shah and his wife Aeisha Julia Shah (above) were accused of trafficking their Pakistani nephew and enslaving him for two-and-a-half years. All charges have been dropped\nAccording to court documents, police had alleged Mr Shah brought the man – believed to be aged in his 20s – to Australia for the purpose of exploitation between February 2014 and September 2015.\nThey had further alleged Mr and Mrs Shah, who operate five patisseries, took the man’s passport and denied him access to a bank account.\nDetectives raided The Cake Merchant stores in Liverpool, Campbelltown and Bonnyrigg, before they seized three mobile phones and financial documents during a search of the Shahs’ home.\nMr Shah was originally charged with conducting a business involving servitude between September 2015 and February 2018.\nMrs Shah was charged with conducting a business involving servitude between August 2015 and October 2017.\nThe nephew had lived with the couple at their Denham Court estate, which features with seven bedrooms, a swimming pool and tennis court.\nMr Shah, then 59, and Mrs Shah, 48, were arrested at their $4million home at Denham Court in Sydney ‘s western suburbs in November 2021. Mr Shah is pictured under arrest\nThe Shahs, who operated their business under the name Sweet Incentive Pty Ltd, were granted bail on the day of their arrest and forced to surrender their passports.\nThey were not allowed to contact anyone outside Australia, were not allowed to go within 100m of any international point of departure, and were banned from having a phone with internet access, unless it was used for work purposes.\nTheir arrest came after Australian Federal Police received a report from the Fair Work Ombudsman in March 2018 that alleged a worker had been mistreated at one of The Cake Merchant stores.\nPolice alleged the couple had monitored their nephew’s phone calls, kept him isolated from the community, made him work excessive hours and did not pay him properly.\nThe Shahs were in and out of court for almost two years as new charges were added, then later withdrawn.\nDetectives raided The Cake Merchant stores in Liverpool, Campbelltown and Bonnyrigg, before seizing three mobile phones and financial documents during a search of the Shahs’ home\nMr Shah was facing two counts of conducting a business involving the servitude of another person and one count of aggravated deception of a person regarding entry and confiscation of documents.\nMrs Shah was facing two counts of conducting a business involving the servitude of another person. In July last year, one servitude charge against each of the Shahs was dropped.\nThe Shahs pleaded not guilty and a trial was set for November this year but on September 29 the remaining three charges were withdrawn in the District Court at the behest of the Crown.\nThe Commonwealth DPP could not provide any information about why the charges were dropped.\n‘I confirm that the CDPP discontinued the proceedings in accordance with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth,’ a spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.",

    "text": "Un reciente análisis señaló que el porcentaje de adultos que sufren de diabetes alrededor del mundo, se duplicó durante las últimas tres décadas, especialmente en los países en desarrollo.\nEl estudio, que se publicó en la revista The Lancet , indicó que en 2022, el 14 por ciento de los adultos en el planeta sufrían de dicha condición de salud, a comparación de 1990, cuando solo el siete por ciento presentaba el padecimiento.\nDurante la investigación, la cual contempló el crecimiento exponencial de la población, se observó que más de 800 millones de personas ahora son diabéticas, cuando hace 30 años eran menos de 200 millones.\nDichas cifras engloban los dos tipos principales de diabetes, la tipo 1 que afecta al sector juvenil y es más difícil de tratar debido a la deficiencia de insulina, así como la tipo 2 , que radica principalmente en personas de mediana o mayor edad que perdieron la sensibilidad a la insulina.\nSin embargo, en los países desarrollados, como Japón, Canadá o Europa Occidental , las tasas de diabetes se mantuvieron, incluso disminuyeron. “La carga de la diabetes y la diabetes no tratada recae cada vez más en los países de bajos y medianos ingresos”, aseguró el estudio.\nLos investigadores añadieron que la obesidad es un “importante impulsor” de la diabetes tipo 2, así como una dieta no saludable .\nFinalmente, los colaboradores destacaron la brecha que existe en el acompañamiento de dicha condición en los países de elite y los más pobres, al destacar que en 2022, tres de cada cinco personas mayores de 30 años con diabetes, es decir, 445 millones de adultos , no recibieron tratamiento.\nUn tercio de esta población se encontraba en India, mientras que en África subsahariana, sólo del cinco al 10 por ciento de adultos con diabetes recibieron atención médica.",

    "text": "Ready-made salad and dressing These foods are unhealthier than expected\nCarlotta Henggeler\n30.1.2025\nCertain foods such as ready-made salad or white flour sandwiches are unhealthy - you learn this at school. blue News shows you which foods you should avoid.\nNo time? blue News summarizes for you\n- Ready-made salads and dressings pose health risks, as cutting the leaves promotes bacterial growth and ready-made dressings often contain sugar and additives.\n- White flour products, canned food and light products are nutritionally questionable as they offer few nutrients, contain potentially harmful chemicals or can trigger hunger pangs due to sweeteners.\n- Processed foods such as sausage, ready meals and sugar-rich cereals increase health risks, which is why fresh, unprocessed alternatives are preferable.\nWhat seems harmless at first glance is not always good for your health: ready-made salads and white flour products harbor hidden risks. Healthy eating is not always easy.\nSome foods that are considered harmless can cause unexpected harm to the body.\nHere is an overview of unhealthy foods:\nStay away from fast food\nWe've all been there: after a stressful week at work, we occasionally crave an unhealthy burger and an even unhealthier portion of fries.\nThat's fine as long as it's just one thing. But as soon as you combine this exception with other \"food traps\", it becomes a long-term health risk.\nReady-made pizza? Better not\nA ready-made pizza every now and then won't harm your health. But it's still not really healthy.\nIt is therefore important that you avoid unhealthy foods such as sweets or potato chips on the other days of the week and eat a balanced and fresh diet instead.\nOrganic is not necessarily better\nIf a product is labeled \"organic\", many people automatically consider it to be healthy. But this is a fallacy: in fact, the declaration only provides information about the cultivation of the ingredients. Nevertheless, organic potato chips or organic pizzas are usually unhealthy due to the added sugar or salt.\nYou should leave out white flour products\nStay away from white flour. This is because it contains no minerals or vitamins worth mentioning for your body. Instead, the body needs its own vitamin and mineral reserves in order to be able to digest the white flour at all. It also converts the white flour into pure sugar, which in turn has a negative effect on blood sugar levels.\nSo instead of the less filling white flour bread rolls, you should switch to nutrient-rich wholemeal bread in future. The same applies to pasta, biscuits and other pasta products.\nIn the long term, this approach will save you a lot of empty calories, prevent cravings and provide your body with more vitamins, minerals and fiber.\nCanned food contains a dangerous chemical\nOf course, it is usually more convenient to add the corn straight from the can to the salad instead of cooking it fresh and laboriously scooping it out. However, canned food is not really healthy: a lot of salt or sugar is often added to canned vegetables or fruit.\nIn addition, many canned foods are coated with the hormone-like pollutant bisphenol-A (BPA). This is on the EU list of the most dangerous chemicals and can leach into the contents of the can. This not only sounds unappetizing, it is also unhealthy, as even small amounts of BPA are enough to disrupt the body's hormone balance. So if you want to be on the safe side, it's better to buy fresh or from a jar.\nLight products often contain flavor enhancers\nMany people opt for \"light\" products because they contain less fat and less sugar. Instead, however, the products often contain flavor enhancers, aromas and sweeteners. The latter in particular can stimulate the appetite and make you \"addicted\" to more.\nNot all rice is the same\nRice is not nearly as healthy as it may seem at first glance, at least when it comes to white rice: This is milled and polished during production, which means that the nutrients in the husk are lost.\nIt is therefore better to use unpolished and unpolished whole grain rice. Compared to white rice, it contains more vitamins, minerals and fiber.\nIf you cannot find whole grain rice in the supermarket, parboiled rice is a good alternative: Compared to wholegrain rice, it is not as healthy, but the vitamins and minerals in the husk are pressed into the inside during production. This preserves 80 percent of them.\nSausage is not sausage at all\nA vegetarian lifestyle has many advantages, but it is really crucial for your health to avoid sausage: this has been classified as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The same applies to ham. The reason for this is the chemical preservatives contained in processed sausages and finished red meat products. These are unhealthy and increase the risk of bowel cancer.\nBetter to eat a whole orange\nFruit juices don't just look great, eating them also promises the intake of many vitamins. But that's only half the truth ...\nIn fact, when fruit is squeezed, a lot of the fiber it contains is lost. This means that after drinking a glass of orange juice, you won't feel full. At the same time, you need five oranges to make it. It is therefore better to eat a single orange and thus minimize your fruit sugar consumption.\nBouillon and glutamate: better to buy organic\nWhen it comes to vegetable stock, certified organic products are the better choice: unlike conventional vegetable stocks, these must not contain flavor enhancers such as glutamate. The same applies to flavorings and sugar.\nCornflakes and muesli bars are often sugar bombs\nFor many people, the morning portion of cornflakes is an inevitable start to a good day. Unfortunately, however, these sweet cereals are usually anything but healthy.\nInstead of the sugary calorie bombs, which are also hardly filling, you should opt for wholemeal oat flakes with fresh fruit.\nEnergy bars are also often advertised as healthy. In reality, however, they contain a good portion of industrially processed soy or milk proteins, sugar, artificial flavors and trans fats.\nReady-made salads and sauces: not a good idea\nWhy are ready-made salads and sauces unhealthy? This is because the natural protection against bacteria and fungi is lost when the leaves are cut. The cell sap that forms on the cut surfaces not only attracts germs, the plastic packaging also provides a perfect breeding ground for them to spread, as it is warm and moist under the foil.\nIncidentally, the salad becomes even unhealthier if you garnish it with ready-made dressing. This not only contains a lot of sugar, but often also other undesirable ingredients. It is therefore better to use a homemade vinaigrette made from vinegar, oil and a dash of honey. It's quick to make and healthier too.",

    "text": "Jobs under threat at M&S in Ireland in company restructuring\nManagement at retailer Marks & Spencer will hold talks with union representatives next week amid fears for the jobs of up to 130 staff at its Republic of Ireland stores.\nMiddle management staff at the Irish stores of M&S could face redundancy as the company undertakes a restructuring of its operations in the State. M&S has 16 stores in the Republic.\n“As we continue to invest in and transform our business in Ireland, we need a store management structure that is fully focused on driving a high-performance culture so we are consulting with our colleagues on some proposed changes that we believe will help our stores operate more effectively for our colleagues and our customers,\" the company said in a statement.\nStaff at the company's Irish stores were informed this week of the proposed changes, which will affect managerial staff including store team managers. A company spokesperson said no timeframe was available for the restructuring.\nIt is believed M&S management want to bring in new conditions for staff which would end existing contracts, affecting agreed working hours, rosters, and shift premiums. One member of staff who will be affected by the restructuring described the new roles as \"watered down\" versions of the existing middle management positions. An M&S spokesman said that while around 130 staff were affected by the proposed changes, the company plans to employ 180 staff in new roles in Ireland.\nUnion representatives will meet company management on Tuesday, April 1. A Mandate spokesperson said the union had been informed of company plans for restructuring of its team manager grade. The union represents more than 100 staff who are in these roles. \"The company contacted us yesterday to let us know they had informed staff,\" the Mandate spokesperson said. \"In our position we are always looking to avoid any redundancies in the first instance.\"\nThe retailer's Northern Ireland stores are not expected to be affected by the planned restructuring changes.\nIn its most recent annual accounts, Marks & Spencer in Ireland reported an increase in operating profit to around €33.5m on annual sales of €384m to the end of March 2023. The company has not yet released figures for 2024.\nAlong with its 16 dedicated stores, M&S has separately rolled out franchise outlets in some Applegreen petrol station outlets in Ireland.",

    "text": "Press Release Four More Co-Conspirators Charged in Alleged Nationwide Abusive-Trust Tax Shelter Scheme For Immediate Release Office of Public Affairs Defendants Allegedly Caused More Than Tens of Millions in Unpaid Federal Income Taxes A superseding indictment was returned yesterday by a federal grand jury in Denver charging four people with conspiring with Larry Conner and Timothy McPhee to defraud the IRS. Connor and McPhee had previously been indicted for conspiring to defraud the IRS related to the same scheme in September 2023.\nAccording to the superseding indictment, from February 2018 until September 2023, Marcia Predmore, Roderick Prescott, Suzanne Thompson and Weldon Wulstein allegedly conspired with Conner, McPhee and others to promote, sell and implement an abusive-trust tax shelter scheme. The superseding indictment further charges Thompson and Wulstein with assisting in the preparation of false income tax returns on behalf of clients who used the shelter. Predmore and McPhee had previously been charged with tax evasion related to their use of the tax shelter to conceal their own income from the IRS. Conner and McPhee had also previously been charged with assisting in the preparation of false income tax returns on behalf of clients who used the shelter.\nAccording to the superseding indictment, the shelter was marketed as a way for business owners to avoid paying federal income taxes on nearly all of their business income. Conner and McPhee allegedly instructed clients to use the fraudulent tax shelter by assigning nearly all of their business income to a series of sham trusts and a purported “private family foundation” to create the illusion that the income did not belong to the client. Conner and McPhee then allegedly referred the clients to handpicked tax-return preparers for the preparation of false individual income tax returns that did not report the income assigned to the trusts or that was donated to the foundation. In reality, however, the clients allegedly retained full control and use of that income. Although the income assigned to the sham trusts was reported on tax returns for the trusts, those tax returns allegedly offset the income with improper deductions, including donations, to report $0 in taxes owed.\nAs to Prescott, the superseding indictment charges that through his business, The Stewardship Institute, Prescott promoted the “private family foundation” that was advertised as the final step of the tax shelter. Prescott allegedly taught about the foundation at workshops he hosted with Conner, McPhee, Predmore and others. Prescott allegedly advised clients how to spend the funds “donated” to their private family foundations for their own personal use and to disguise the transactions to make them appear charitable. Prescott also allegedly oversaw the preparation of the instruments used to create the so-called private family foundations.\nThe superseding indictment alleges that Conner, McPhee and Predmore referred clients to Thompson for bookkeeping services and Wulstein for return preparation services. Thompson allegedly operated a bookkeeping firm called The CFO Agency; Wulstein allegedly operated a return preparation firm called Wulstein Financial Services. Thompson and her employees allegedly prepared financial statements for clients who used the abusive-trust tax shelter and sent those financial statements to Wulstein for the preparation of false tax returns.\nIf convicted, each defendant faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for conspiring to defraud the United States. Conner, McPhee, Thompson and Wulstein also face a maximum penalty of three years in prison for each count of assisting in the preparation of a false tax return. McPhee and Predmore face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each count of tax evasion. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\nActing Deputy Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division made the announcement.\nIRS Criminal Investigation is investigating the case.\nTrial Attorneys Amanda R. Scott and Lauren K. Pope and Senior Litigation Counsel Corey J. Smith of the Tax Division are prosecuting the case.\nAn indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\nUpdated April 25, 2024",

    "text": "El ministro de Energía y Minas, Rómulo Mucho, destacó que el Perú presenta mucho potencial y una serie de oportunidades para los inversionistas del mundo para el desarrollo de las energías renovables y, específicamente, del hidrógeno verde.\nDurante su ponencia denominada “Políticas e iniciativas relacionadas con el hidrógeno”, sostuvo que el Perú busca evolucionar desde un modelo basado en combustibles fósiles a un modelo con bajas emisiones de carbono, basándose en el uso de fuentes y energías renovables, que se pueden aprovechar para la industria del hidrógeno verde.\nExplicó que la matriz energética nacional se centra principalmente en el consumo de hidrocarburos, siendo el sector transporte el principal consumidor con un 42.7 %; seguido por el sector industrial y minero con 29 %; y luego el sector residencial, comercial y público con 25.9 %; entre otros.\n“En el sector del transporte existe un enorme mercado para la sustitución de hidrocarburos mediante el uso de vehículos eléctricos de batería o de pilas de combustible (hidrógeno), siendo el Diesel B5 el combustible más usado con más del 56 %, seguido de los gasoholes y el Gas Licuado de Petróleo (GLP), entre otros”, comentó.\nEn ese sentido, el ministro detalló que en el sector eléctrico también existe una buena oportunidad para el desarrollo del hidrógeno verde, pues las energías renovables alcanzaron el 6.25 % en la producción eléctrica del 2023; agregando que las energías renovables tuvieron una participación del 54 % en la generación de energía en Perú.\n“En marzo de 2024 se promulgó en el Perú la Ley N° 31992, ‘Ley para la Promoción del Hidrógeno Verde’, cuya finalidad es promover la investigación, producción, transformación, distribución, comercialización, exportación y uso de hidrógeno verde como vector combustible y energético, en sus diferentes aplicaciones”, comentó.\nEl ministro Rómulo Mucho participó en el \"LATAM-Japan Hydrogen Workshop 2024\", que permitirá conocer las distintas perspectivas de países, organizaciones internacionales y líderes empresariales sobre el desarrollo del hidrógeno en los procesos de producción de las industrias manufactureras, cementeras, de acero, entre otras.\nAsimismo, recalcó que se proyecta que, a 2040, el hidrógeno verde será dominante en competitividad debido a los bajos precios de la electricidad previstos, el alto potencial renovable que ofrece nuestro país, especialmente en el sur, y la reducción de los costos de la tecnología.\nMás en Andina:\n??

    "text": "Costuma fazer lanches ricos em açúcar e calóricos por ser o que lhe apetece naquele momento? Um dos problemas pode estar num erro que está a cometer ao pequeno-almoço. Alguns especialistas em nutrição revelam o que pode fazer com que o corpo reaja desta forma.\nUm dos problemas está em consumir menos proteínas. Em vez disso, acaba por consumir alimentos ricos em açúcar o que leva ao aumento dos níveis de açúcar no sangue e a quebras mais tarde. Desta forma, acaba por voltar a ter desejo por algo doce e açucarado a meio da manhã e até depois do almoço.\n\"O pequeno-almoço muitas vezes acaba por ser a refeição mais rica em carboidratos do dia, como é o caso das torradas, cereais, doces ou apenas café\", começa por dizer a dietista Marissa Karp à FoxNews.\n\"Estas opções são rápidas, mas geralmente têm baixo teor de proteína e podem fazer com que sinta fome novamente passadas uma ou duas horas\", continua. Assim revela que o consumo de proteína é algo em que deve apostar de forma a conseguir reduzir este tipo de desejos.\nLeia Também: Dietista revela como combater envelhecimento da pele\n\"A proteína demora mais para ser digerida do que os carboidratos simples, o que significa que pode reduzir o apetite por mais tempo. Também desempenha um papel fundamental na produção de neurotransmissores como dopamina e serotonina, que podem impactar no humor, o foco e no bem-estar mental em geral\", revela a especialista.\nO consumo de proteína pela manhã pode melhorar o cérebro, reforçar a memória e até trazer algum equilíbrio emocional. \"Devido ao seu papel no controlo do açúcar no sangue, a proteína pela manhã mantém a energia estável ao longo do dia, o que é essencial.\"\nMuitas pessoas acabam por consumir mais proteína à hora do jantar, o que é outro erro que pode estar a cometer. \"Está a consumir muita energia numa altura do dia em que não será mais gasta e utilizada.\"\nMas será preciso gastar dinheiro em suplementos e proteínas? A verdade é que pode ser mais simples do que isso e sem nenhum tipo de batidos. \"Escorra uma lata de feijão cozido, lave-o bem, coloque-o em um recipiente no frigorífico e pense em como pode adicionar uma colherada ao longo da semana.\"\nOvos mexidos, torrada de abacate e tofu são outras das ideias que pode juntar ao seu pequeno-almoço. Tenha ainda muito cuidado com alimentos processados e bebidas que são enriquecidas com proteína.\n\"Cereais, granolas, barras de cereais, pães, muffins, aveia com sabor, iogurtes açucarados e smoothies são na verdade apenas carboidratos refinados simples\", continua.\nEntão, qual é a melhor escolha para fazer ao pequeno-almoço? Iogurte grego com canela, frutos vermelhos, sementes de linhaça moídas, frutos secos, ovos com vegetais, tomate e espinafres são outras das escolhas em que deve apostar.\nJá ao lanche, seja a meio da manhã ou da tarde, pode optar por um chocolate negro, amêndoas, iogurte skyr, ou algo que junte manteiga de amendoim.\n“A vontade de comer doces à tarde costuma ser uma forma do corpo sinalizar que não ingeriu proteína, fibra ou gorduras saudáveis suficiente no início do dia\", conclui.\nLeia Também: Alimentos que estão a afetar o seu metabolismo e a deixá-lo lento",
