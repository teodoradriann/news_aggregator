    "text": "Des pêcheurs qui défilent aux côtés des agriculteurs, des blocages qui se durcissent grâce au concours des professionnels du bâtiment : en Bretagne, plusieurs secteurs d’activité se sont greffés au mouvement des agriculteurs, jeudi 25 janvier. Près de Rennes (Ille-et-Vilaine), des dizaines de pêcheurs se sont joints aux éleveurs. \"La filière pêche, comme la filière de l’agriculture, est appelée à disparaître\" , a déploré David Le Quintrec, patron fileyeur à Lorient (Morbihan).\nUn dépôt pétrolier bloqué à Lorient À Lorient, les manifestants ont bloqué le dépôt pétrolier. La colère se cristallise sur la hausse des taxes sur le gazole non-routier (GNR). \"Le gouvernement fait en sorte de diviser pour mieux régner, on a la preuve qu’on s’unit pour mieux combattre\" , a expliqué le président de la Chambre des artisans des travaux publics du Morbihan, Norbert Guillou. Ces blocages pourraient s’inscrire dans la durée si le Premier ministre Gabriel Attal ne parvient à répondre à leurs revendications.",

Former Lands Cabinet Secretary Alice Wahome has said that President William can count on her continued support. This is after Ruto dismissed his entire Cabinet, save for Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi. Wahome thanked Ruto for the opportunity to serve in his first Cabinet, under two different ministries. \"This is to convey my sincere gratitude to H.E Dr William Samoei Ruto for the opportunity and privilege you granted to me to serve as the Cabinet Secretary Lands, Public Works, Housing and Urban Development and previously as a Cabinet Secretary Water, Sanitation and Irrigation,\" her statement reads in part. Wahome went on to say that during the 21 months she has been in Cabinet, the President supported her fully in doing her job. She added she will always support the Head of State to build a stronger country. \"During my period of service, you gave me support in the execution of my duties and I will forever remain grateful,\" the former CS said. \"You can count on my continued support, especially during this time when our Nation requires all hands and energies pulling together to build a stronger and resilient Kenya.\" On Thursday, President Ruto dissolved the entire Cabinet, sending home all Cabinet Secretaries and Attorney General. The President said the affairs of the Ministries will henceforth be coordinated by Principal Secretaries until a definitive cabinet is appointed. \"I have decided to dismiss with immediate effect all cabinet secretaries and attorney general of the Cabinet of Kenya except the Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs,\" Ruto said. \"And of course, the office of the Deputy President is not affected in any way.\" The Head of State said the new cabinet will be named after extensive consultations across all sectors.",

    "text": "Iran: Jailed Christians denied Christmas\nA 35-year-old Armenian, Hakop Gochumyan, was visiting a friend's house just outside the capital when plainclothes police arrested him. His personal belongings and Christian books were also seized. Four months later, his wife was released on bail while he is still jailed. This story is one of many, but others often prefer to remain anonymous hoping for release.\nTehran (AsiaNews) – In Iran, Christmas for some Christians is a dark cell, in one of the country’s most notorious prisons, held without charges, aware that they were locked away only for their faith with no prospect for indictment that would enable them to defend themselves, deprived of rights even more than their liberty.\nThis is the case of an Armenian man, one of a hundred Christians arrested last summer and held in Evin prison, north of Tehran, who, after four months, is still unaware of his fate, with the only certainty of spending the holiday away from his family.\nThe story of 35-year-old Hakop Gochumyan is relayed by Article18, an advocacy group seeking to protect and promote religious freedom in Iran and on behalf of its persecuted Christians.\nThe Armenian national was visiting Iran with his wife Elissa, who has dual Armenian-Iranian citizenship, and their two children. On 15 August, the two adults were arrested in Pardis, on the outskirts of Tehran.\nAccording to some witnesses, the couple, with their children aged seven and 10, were at a friend's house for lunch when a dozen plainclothes agents from the Ministry of Intelligence burst in and took them away.\nAfter searching the house, they brought Hakop and Elissa to Evin prison, placed the couple's children in the care of an aunt, and seized their personal belongings, including Christian books.\nSince then, the couple have been held in solitary confinement in the infamous Ward 209, subjected to intense psychological torture and repeated interrogations, each lasting between two and five hours.\nIranian authorities have not laid any formal charges against Hakop and Elissa while keeping them in custody, in violation of Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified by Iran.\nAfter more than two months of detention, Elissa was released on 19 October on US$ 40,000 bail (down from US$ 100,000), which allowed her to return to Armenia to her two children, who had previously been repatriated with a relative. Her husband, instead, has remained in prison all this time.\nSpeaking to Article18, his wife said that secret service agents accused her of involvement in “illegal Christian activities”.\nShe said she did not know where the accusation came from, noting that neither she nor her husband had done anything illegal, nor engaged in any Christian activities during their visit to Iran.\nElissa is the daughter of a well-known Iranian-Armenian pastor, Rafi Shahverdian, who passed away earlier this year. He led a church in Yerevan after he left Iran in 1993.\nAnti-Christian persecution is a further evidence that religious freedom in Iran is in “\nsharp regression” in parallel with the growing repression by the authorities against protests that broke out following the death of Mahsa Amini in the hands of the morality police.\nIn its\n2023 report, published last May, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom describes the Islamic Republic as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) for its “systematic, egregious and ongoing violations”.\nMore than a hundred Christians, mostly converts from Islam but also several Assyrian-Chaldeans baptised at an early age, were arrested between June and September in 11 different cities.\nAnother 69 have been arrested and at least 10 – four men and six women – have been held in detention, various advocacy groups have reported on their website. For those out on bail, families paid amounts ranging from US$ 8,000 to US$ 40,000.\nThis wave of arrests also coincided with a new crackdown against Iran’s Baha'i community, which along with Christian converts is another group not recognised by Iranian authorities.\nSome of those released had to sign a pledge to refrain from further Christian activities or had to participate in Islamic re-education sessions. Others were summoned for further questioning, lost their jobs, or were deported.\nTwo of the Christians detained because of their faith will spend Christmas under lock and key in an undisclosed location; the two are brothers, one of whom is a known, former prisoner of conscience.\nMilad Goodarzi was released earlier this year as part of a broader amnesty for detainees to mark the Islamic Republic's 44th anniversary.\nLike many other prisoners, Milad had already served most of his three-year sentence, reduced from five, for “engaging in propaganda that educates in a deviant way contrary to the holy religion of Islam”.\nMilad’s case has received wide coverage, but that is not the case for many others. Instead, most Christians arrested this year have opted not to publicise their situation, hoping it may help their case, adding to a growing sense of faceless victims.\nIranians protest new wave of poisonings of schoolgirls\n12/04/2023 12:05",

    "text": "ATR presented the 2023 results for aircraft sales and deliveries. This period highlights solid growth driven by increased deliveries and sales, good performance in support and services, and the addition of new customers.\nIn 2023, ATR delivered a total of 36 aircraft, a 44% increase compared to 2022. The Italo-French manufacturer had to face disruptions in the supply chain, with shortages of raw materials and components slowing down the manufacturer’s ambitious acceleration.\nRegarding sales, 40 firm orders were received, surpassing by 53% the sales achieved in 2022. Eleven new customers have added ATR aircraft to their fleets, both new and second-hand aircraft.\nIn the second-hand market, over 100 transactions were recorded, demonstrating the high demand for ATR turboprops.\nAsia remains ATR’s most dynamic market, with the company also securing orders from Latin American and European customers in 2023, both for fleet growth and replacement. In total, 160 new routes were opened with ATR aircraft last year, compared to 150 in 2022.\nAccording to information obtained by Aviacionline through Cirium, as of February 2024, there are 1506 routes around the world operated with ATR aircraft. The average distance traveled is 394 kilometers. With 143 weekly flights per direction, Gran Canaria (LPA) and Tenerife-Norte (TFN) have the highest frequency-operated ATR route globally, followed by Lanzarote (ACE) – Gran Canaria (LPA) with 142 and Kathmandu (KTM) – Pokhara (PKR) with 133.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, the ATR fleet operates 246 routes with an average distance of 370 kilometers. With 107 weekly flights per direction, Port of Spain (POS) – Tobago (TAB) has the highest frequency, followed by Medellin (EOH) – Quibdo (UIB) with 57 flights per direction and Fernando de Noronha (FEN) – Recife (REC) with 55 weekly flights per direction.\nATR also highlighted that it achieved revenues of nearly $1.2 billion for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, also supported by a record year in services, with revenues exceeding $400 million.\nRegional Market\nThe company expects higher demand in the coming years, with expected fleet growth mainly in Asia (India, Indonesia, and the Philippines) and Brazil.\nNew regulations related to increasing environmental pressure also create opportunities for ATR to capture a significant portion of the replacement market, especially in Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United States, as ATR aircraft offer an immediate solution to drastically reduce emissions compared to similar-sized regional jets.\nNathalie Tarnaud Laude, CEO of ATR, said, “2024 will be a year of stabilization, paving the way for future growth, and we have already delivered two aircraft since the beginning of the year, marking a promising pace for ATR.”\n“Our 2023 results underscore the value and relevance of our products and services and our ability to adapt to the changing dynamics of the market. Our turboprops remain the backbone of many regional airline fleets, praised for their fuel efficiency, low emissions, profitability, and versatility,” she added.",

    "text": "Emiten advertencias de inundaciones para varios municipios Otras advertencias fueron extendidas por el Servicio Nacional de Meteorología. El Servicio Nacional de Meteorología (SNM) en San Juan emitió y extendió varias advertencias de inundaciones repentinas debido a lluvias intensas y tormentas eléctricas que afectan distintas regiones de Puerto Rico este viernes. Municipios de Ceiba, Fajardo, Luquillo, Naguabo y Río Grande Una advertencia de inundación repentina está vigente hasta las 4:00 de la tarde. Las fuertes lluvias han causado que los ríos Blanco, Fajardo y Mameyes alcancen niveles cercanos a inundación. Hasta el momento, se han registrado entre 1 y 4 pulgadas de lluvia en el área, y se espera que caiga hasta una pulgada adicional. Según el SNM, las inundaciones están ocurriendo y representan una amenaza para la vida. Municipios de Humacao, Maunabo, Patillas y Yabucoa El SNM ha emitido una advertencia de inundación repentina hasta las 3:45 de la tarde para estos municipios. Las fuertes lluvias asociadas con tormentas eléctricas han dejado hasta 1 pulgada de agua acumulada, con proyecciones de que podrían caer entre una y dos pulgadas adicionales. Se reporta la posibilidad de inundaciones rápidas en pequeños arroyos, áreas urbanas y carreteras. Municipios de Gurabo, Juncos y Las Piedras Una advertencia de inundación repentina está vigente hasta las 2:00 de la tarde en estos municipios. Las lluvias intensas han causado que los niveles de los ríos y arroyos suban rápidamente, aumentando el riesgo de inundaciones en áreas de baja altitud y de drenaje deficiente. Se anticipa la acumulación de hasta dos pulgadas adicionales de lluvia en la zona. Medidas de precaución y seguridad El SNM aconseja a los residentes y conductores en estas áreas evitar cruzar carreteras inundadas. “Gire, no se ahogue” es la recomendación, ya que la mayoría de las muertes por inundaciones ocurren en vehículos. Además, se recomienda mantenerse alerta y alejarse de ríos y áreas propensas a deslizamientos, ya que las orillas pueden volverse inestables con las lluvias intensas. Para reportar inundaciones observadas, se solicita a los residentes comunicarse con los servicios de emergencia locales y pedir que transmitan la información al SNM cuando sea seguro hacerlo.",

    "title": "Innovations in Animal Health: Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Hematocrit Analysis for Rapid Anemia Detection in Small Ruminants",
    "text": "Due to their value as a food source, fiber, and other products globally, there has been a growing focus on the well-being and health of small ruminants, particularly in relation to anemia induced by blood-feeding gastrointestinal parasites like Haemonchus contortus. The objective of this study was to assess the hematocrit (HCT) levels in blood samples from small ruminants, specifically goats, and create an efficient biosensor for more convenient, yet accurate detection of anemia for on-farm use in agricultural environments for animal production optimization. The study encompassed 75 adult male Spanish goats, which underwent HCT testing to ascertain their HCT ranges and their association with anemic conditions. Using Artificial Intelligence-powered machine learning algorithms, an advanced, easy-to-use sensor was developed for rapidly alerting farmers as to low red blood cell count of their animals, in this way to enable timely medical intervention. The developed sensor utilizes a semi-invasive technique that requires only a small blood sample. More precisely, a volume of 30 µL of blood was placed onto Whatman filter paper No. 1 previously soaked with anhydrous glycerol. The blood dispersion pattern on the glycerol-infused paper was then recorded using a smartphone after 180 seconds. Subsequently, these images were examined in correlation with established HCT values obtained from conventional HCT analysis. Four separate artificial intelligence-machine learning models (AI-ML)supported models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), and image classification based Keras model, were created and assessed using the image dataset. The dataset consisted of 1,000 images that were divided into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio. Using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, the models were optimized and trained to reduce categorical cross-entropy loss to improve accuracy over several epochs. The initial findings indicated a detection accuracy of 76.06% after only 10 epochs for recognizing different levels of HCT in relation to anemia, ranging from healthy to severely anemic. This testing accuracy increased markedly, to 95.8% after 100 epochs and other model parameters optimization. Results for SVM learning algorithms had an overall F1-score of 74–100% in identifying the HCT range for blood pattern images representing healthy to severely anemic animals, KNN showed a range of 50%-97% accuracy in identifying the HCT range, and BPNN showed 91–100% accuracy in identifying the HCT range for anemia detection. This innovation not only greatly reduces the time and skill often needed for such evaluations, but also establishes the basis for a straightforward, efficient, and easy-to-use technique of screening for anemia. This has the potential to enhance the care and handling of livestock in agricultural environments.",

    "text": "Türkiye nabs 32 suspected terrorists over plotting attacks on religious sites, Iraqi Embassy Turkish security forces nabbed 32 suspects, including three senior members of the Daesh/ISIS terror group, who were plotting to attack synagogues, churches, and the Iraqi Embassy in Türkiye, security officials said Friday, [News.Az](https://news.az/News.Az) reports citing Anadolu Agency. The Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) identified the senior members of the terror group as Mejbel Al-Shweihi, codenamed Abou Yakeen Al-Iraqi, and Mohammad Khallaf Ibrahim, codenamed Abou Laith, who were planning attacks on synagogues and churches in Türkiye. Also, Ihab Elaani, codenamed Abdullah Al-Jumaili, was plotting a terror attack on the Iraqi Embassy in Türkiye. In a coordinated operation conducted at dawn by MIT and Turkish police in nine different cities, the senior terrorists and 29 other individuals linked with them were apprehended. The operation resulted in the seizure of numerous digital materials belonging to the terror group. In 2013, Türkiye became one of the first countries to declare Daesh/ISIS a terrorist organization. The country has since been attacked by the terror group multiple times, with over 300 people killed and hundreds more injured in at least 10 suicide bombings, seven bomb attacks, and four armed attacks. In response, Türkiye launched anti-terror operations at home and abroad to prevent further attacks.",
