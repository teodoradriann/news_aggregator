    "text": "SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — A series of high-stakes talks between U.S. and Mexican officials is bringing changes to the border in San Diego. The Mexican government will launch a new task force to address the recent surge of migrants. According to an ABC News report, as many as 10,000 migrants were arrested daily across the U.S.-Mexico border in December. The idea for the task force was created after U.S. leaders pressed Mexico to do more to stem the crisis. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials say December 2023 is on track to have the highest number of apprehensions at the border ever. RELATED: [US delegation in Mexico as it begins clearing migrant camp](https://www.10news.com/us-delegation-in-mexico-as-it-begins-clearing-migrant-camp) San Diego Border Patrol Chief Patricia McGurk-Daniel provided ABC 10News with new numbers regarding this influx at the border in our backyard. In the last week, she says agents apprehended more than 7,000 people from 75 countries. Of those people, 142 of them were unaccompanied children. They also stopped 11 human smuggling events during that period. The recent wave led CBP to close the [PedWest crossing facility](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/pedwest-to-temporarily-pause-operations-this-weekend) in San Ysidro in order to free up resources to assist with the staggering number of migrants. 10News spoke to Congressman Juan Vargas about the issue, and he believes too many resources have been diverted. \"We've closed down PedWest, which is a tremendous problem,\" Vargas says. \"I do understand Homeland Security is under a difficult situation, where other parts of the border are arriving, that is true. You have a lot more migrants that are showing up in areas than San Diego. THey're diverting resources there, but they're diverting too many resources.\" Reopening the PedWest Port of Entry is among the goals of the new task force. Mexican leaders say Mexico will regularly meet with countries in Central and Latin America as the situation evolves. The next meeting will be held in Jan. 2024. CONTINUING COVERAGE:",

    "title": "Likelihood of seeing Northern Lights again tonight after cosmic phenomenon yesterday left Brits stunned",
    "text": "The Instagram feeds of thousands of UK dwellers were littered last night with vibrant snaps of the famous aurora borealis. As such, many of those who might have enjoyed an [early night](https://www.tyla.com/sleep) and missed last night's magical spectacle have frantically been Googling whether or not they'll get a second chance to see it. Advert Known more commonly as the [Northern Lights](https://www.tyla.com/weather), these magical spectacles are usually only visible to individuals living in very specific corners of the globe. The natural light display - which sees colourful rays, spirals and explosive flickers painted across the night sky - is usually only seen in high-latitude regions. For those living in the [Arctic and Antarctic](https://www.tyla.com/travel) it's an almost daily occurrence, and a pretty regular sight to those who are based in Scandinavia. Caused by collisions between charged particles from the sun and molecules in Earth's upper atmosphere, only on the oddest of occasions are they visible to those living in the [UK](https://www.tyla.com/uk-news) and Ireland. Advert Opportunities to see this phenomenon are super infrequent, however, man-made light pollution from towns and cities prohibits the vast splashes of pinks and greens to be seen by the naked eye. Only recently have we Brits, Welsh, Scots and Irish dwellers been lucky enough to see the lights more vividly and more frequently. Back in May, [social media](https://www.tyla.com/social-media) was abashed with images of the cosmological phenomenon panning the dark night sky because the sun took a more active role in the molecular cycle. Advert The sun's cycle lasts for roughly 11 years whilst its magnetic fields clip, sometimes in setting off solar flares and solar storms, which make the lights brighter. Such was the case last night (Thursday 10 October), when a raging geomagnetic storm in the earth's atmosphere meant that many residents from up and down the country were able to see the Northern Lights without any astrological equipment whatsoever. Sadly, however, experts have now said that the likelihood of us catching another Northern Lights show over the weekend is almost impossible to determine. That's because whether or not the 'solar maximum' will end and the solar activity start is difficult to ascertain. Advert According to the Met Office's latest space weather, the chances of seeing it again remain 'initially', but will start 'gradually easing' from today, 'becoming increasingly confined to far northern geomagnetic latitudes by October 13.' The fact that notable rainfall is also predicted across Scotland and Northern Ireland means that it's unlikely we'll see the lights through the dark clouds above. Don't worry if you missed it, however - you can always stick a pic from Google on your Insta story and pretend you were up?",

Just before the war ended, a small group of U.S. soldiers near Magdeburg, Germany discovered a stalled Nazi death train containing 2,500 Holocaust victims. The soldiers became humanitarians, protecting and ultimately liberating the Jews onboard during the waning days of World War II.

Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research and University of Copenhagen introduce an innovative approach to image luminescence lifetimes. This simple approach uses readily-available cost-effective equipment, paving the way for advanced studies of chemical dynamics in environmental and biological systems. For example, it allows to record oxygen dynamics with much higher temporal and spatial precision. Oct 17, 2024, 2:22:57 PM Dr. Fanni Aspetsberger , Max-Planck-Institut für Marine Mikrobiologie Take oxygen, for example: Oxygen is a key molecule for life, and in order to understand ecosystem dynamics it can be important to follow its ways in much detail. Optical sensors that use luminescent dyes have long been used to map oxygen levels in marine systems: Oxygen reduces the phosphorescence lifetimes of the dyes, which thus indicate oxygen concentrations. However, until now, imaging luminescence lifetimes has required costly, specialized equipment, making the technique out of reach for many research and industrial applications. A joint research team at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research and University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with international partners, has developed a pioneering method for imaging the lifetime of luminescent signals. The breakthrough technique enables high-speed luminescence lifetime measurements, transforming fields that rely on optical sensing and chemical imaging. The findings have been published in the journal ACS Sensors. Bringing luminescence lifetime measurement to the masses “Our new integrated method simplifies these measurements, allowing researchers to determine luminescence lifetimes using standard camera systems”, explains Soeren Ahmerkamp, who carried out the research at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen and at the Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research in Warnemünde, both in Germany. By synchronizing short bursts of light with precise camera timing through a technique called frame-straddling, two images are captured: One that records the initial light burst and another that measures the initial light burst and the longer-lasting luminescent after-glow. The difference between these images reveals the integrated luminescence lifetime, providing a detailed and accurate readout at time scales below one millisecond. “We offer a more accessible way to measure luminescence lifetimes, which is often considered the gold standard in optical sensing”, says Michael Kühl from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. “By adopting the frame-straddling technique originally developed for high-speed flow measurements, we’ve created a technique that can be used with a wide range of commercially available cameras. This will make it possible for a wider range of laboratories to perform high-resolution lifetime imaging.” Unlocking new possibilities in chemical imaging The ability to measure luminescence lifetimes with ease and high-speed opens up new possibilities for chemical imaging. Researchers can now record oxygen dynamics with much higher temporal and spatial precision. “We tracked oxygen dynamics around algae within a hundredth of a second and visualized how oxygen-consuming particles move through water, thereby showcasing the utility of the method”, says Ahmerkamp. “The integrated luminescence decay method can be used to gain deeper insights into how oxygen varies in marine environments, from the scale of microscopic particles to entire ecosystems.” Accelerating the pace of discovery in science and industry This new approach could stimulate more luminescence lifetime imaging applications in environmental and biomedical sciences and engineering. By making high-precision measurements more accessible, it can stimulate novel experimental approaches, accelerating the pace of discovery in these areas. “Our goal was to democratize access to a powerful analytical tool,” adds Ahmerkamp. “We believe this method will enable researchers to explore complex chemical interactions with greater ease and flexibility than ever before.” Participating institutions Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Bremen, Germany Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Warnemünde, Germany University of Copenhagen, Denmark University of Aarhus, Denmark University of Uppsala, Sweden Contact for scientific information: Original Publication: Source: https://idw-online.de/de/news841441",

It was loaded with air conditioners.\n\"As soon as I stopped, I jumped out, ran to the truck and there was a fire right around the fuel tank and the back of the cab was starting to burn too,\" said Buchanan.\nHe said the windshield of the truck was loose.\n\"I grabbed the windshield and pulled it off.

It's just part of being human,\" said Buchanan.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",

    "text": "news\nPublished on Dec 29, 2023, 12:46am ET\nAn American Airlines plane bounced off a London runway on Wednesday amid strong gusts of wind, nearly sending it flying back into the sky.\nHeartbreaking video shows the Boeing 777 wobbling left to right several hundreds of feet above the pavement at London Heathrow Airport as it attempts to land after taking off with confidence and ease at 11:45 am.\nFootage shared by Big Jet TV shows the unstable plane's nose straightening up to its body before plunging straight into the air again.\nSomehow, the pilots managed to bring the huge plane back to the ground for a safe landing.\nThe 308-seat aircraft encountered high winds and dense fog caused by Storm Gerrit, a supercell storm that caused widespread flooding, blown off roofs, and multiple deaths across the United Kingdom .\nDespite flying amid strong winds – which reached 80 mph in some areas – the American Airlines plane was only 20 minutes late arriving at Europe's largest airport, FlightAware data shows.\nIt had traveled 6,000 miles and about 11 hours from California when it encountered scary turbulence.\nWhen the American airline's Boeing 777 reached London's Heathrow Airport for the last time on December 26, it started wobbling in the air. Big Jet TV/Youtube The 308-seat plane was battling strong winds and dense fog caused by Hurricane Gerrit. United Kingdom. Big Jet TV/Youtube\nNo injuries associated with the fateful touchdown were reported.\nHowever, air traffic control restrictions on domestic routes following Storm Gerrit forced Heathrow to cancel 18 flights. Flights to European cities like Barcelona and Berlin were also affected.\nThe storm caused widespread disruption to train services several hundred miles north in Scotland, where travel on some lines was suspended until authorities could carry out a full inspection of the network. A tree fell on a train and hit the driver's cabin, but no one was injured.\nThe aircraft tilted shortly before its tires made contact with the ground. Big Jet TV/YouTube Somehow, the pilots were able to get the huge plane back on the ground for a safe landing.

    "text": "Veteran British actor Sir Michael Caine is reportedly set to come out of retirement to star in a new Netflix series.\nThe Sun reports that the icon, 90, has joined a show filming next month of which the details are being kept closely under wraps.\nIt comes two months after Sir Michael announced that he has decided to retire from acting.\nAn source told the publication: ‘He’s been asked to star in a Netflix series. Details are kept closely guarded.’\nA representative for Michael and Netflix have been contacted by MailOnline for further comment.\nVeteran British actor Sir Michael Caine is reportedly set to come out of retirement to star in a new Netflix series\nThe Sun reports that the icon, 90, has joined a show filming next month of which the details are being kept closely under wraps\nSir Michael confirmed his retirement decision in October, following a stellar career spanning seven decades and days after the release of his latest film, The Great Escaper.\nThe talented star – who has starred in over 180 movies – explained his decision came after he concluded that ‘you don’t have leading men at 90.’\nConfirming the news, the beloved thespian told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well I am now.’\n‘I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews… What am I going to do that will beat this?’\nThe Oscar, Golden Globe and Bafta-winning actor has an extensive filmography, including classic films ranging from Zulu and The Italian Job to more recently in Interstellar and The Dark Knight franchise, alongside Christian Bale.\nIn his final movie, The Great Escaper which was released on October 6, he plays real-life World War Two veteran Bernie Jordan who escaped from a care home to attend D-Day celebrations in France.\nSpeaking about his decision to hang up his boots, Sir Michael – who has been using a walking stick for five years after a fall on ice and spinal surgery – said: ‘The only parts I’m liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85.\n‘They’re not going to be the lead. You don’t have leading men at 90, you’re going to have young handsome boys and girls. So I thought, I might as well leave with all this.’\nIt comes two months after Sir Michael announced that he has decided to retire from acting (seen in 2018)\nIn his final movie, The Great Escaper which was released on October 6, he plays real-life World War Two veteran Bernie Jordan who escaped from a care home to attend D-Day celebrations\nSir Michael revealed he had turned down appearing in the The Great Escaper three times before accepting the role, because he considered himself retired.\nHe stars alongside Glenda Jackson, who died in June after the completion of the film.\nSir Michael recently revealed the secret to a long, happy life is to marry a younger woman, stop eating between meals – and wear trainers.\nIn an interview with The Mail on Sunday’s You Magazine, Sir Michael said his advice for longevity is ‘younger wives, no snacking and wearing trainers all the time – and you have to be careful not to fall down’.\nHe married model Shakira, 76, in 1973 after seeing her in a TV advert and tracking her down. She was 26 and he was 40.\nThey have a daughter Natasha and three grandchildren he says also help to keep him youthful, adding: ‘You want to live forever to see what they do with their lives.’\nSir Michael confirmed his retirement decision in October, following a stellar career spanning seven decades (pictured in 1996 film Alfie)",
