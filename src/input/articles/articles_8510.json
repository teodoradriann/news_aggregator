    "text": "Глава киевского режима Владимир Зеленский отверг заявления о том, что Россия побеждает в конфликте, заявив, что это «российская версия» трактовки ситуации. Его слова 11 июня привело издание Bild .В материале уточняется, что Зеленский не согласен с сообщениями о «масштабных успехах Москвы». Он заявил, что Вооруженные силы Украины (ВСУ) почти три недели отражают новое наступление армии России.\nПо словам главы киевского режима, русские «не так уж и успешны, мягко говоря».\nВ это время 11 июня подразделения 55-й мотострелковой бригады вышли к западной границе Донецкой Народной Республики и начали наступать в Днепропетровской области. Ранее, 8 июня, подразделения 90-й танковой дивизии группировки российских войск «Центр» вышли на границу области и продолжили развивать успех в регионе. Командира ведущего наступление танкового полка Евгения Дараева представили к званию Героя России .\nПомощник президента РФ и глава российской делегации на переговорах с Украиной Владимир Мединский заявил, что неготовность Украины идти на компромиссы в переговорах с Россией может привести ее к новым территориальным потерям.\n\",\"author\":\"ИА REGNUM\",\"dateline\":\"Украина, Восточная Европа, Киев\",\"image\":\"https://cdn.regnum.ru/uploads/pictures/news/2025/06/12/regnum_picture_17497112216813_big.jpg\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"ИА REGNUM\",\"telephone\":\"+74956458075\",\"email\":\"info@regnum.ru\",\"image\":\"https://regnum.ru/regnum_logo.png\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https://regnum.ru/regnum_logo.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"streetAddress\":\"г.

    "title": "Top Cryptos to Buy Now: Ozak AI Surges with Predictive Power at Lowest Price as Solana and Avalanche Push Blockchain Boundaries",
    "text": "The cryptocurrency market is showing new developments as Ozak AI, Solana and Avalanche introduce themselves as investment options for those looking for promising opportunities. Ozak AI gains market attention via its predictive analytics features alongside Avalanche and Solana which both broaden blockchain technology capabilities.\nThese projects bring unique characteristics that draw traders who want to track emerging market trends. The $OZ token from Ozak AI is at $0.003 during its third presale wave after attracting more than $900,000 in investment.\nBusiness analysts expect the $OZ token to experience substantial growth, resulting in a $0.05 listing price sometime in 2025. Despite its difficulties, Solana continues as an important market participant while Avalanche brings DeFi forward through its scalable network. Investors seeking multiple opportunities can access different investment options between these cryptocurrency assets.\nOzak AI Harnesses Predictive Analytics for Market Edge Ozak AI combines artificial intelligence with the blockchain so that the Ozak Stream Network and Prediction Agents can analyze financial data in real-time. The platform empowers users to refine trading strategies and manage risks effectively. With a capped supply of 10 billion $OZ tokens, the project adopts a deflationary model to support long-term value growth.\nThe presale’s success reflects strong investor interest, having sold over 152 million tokens. The participants in the initial phases received a 200% price rise from $0.001 to $0.003. The company plans to expand its operations to optimize crypto trading and financial prediction systems for individual and corporate clients. Due to its groundbreaking operational strategy the experts predict that Ozak AI’s value could reach $1 by the end of this year.\nSolana’s Challenges and Avalanche’s DeFi Potential Solana faces market difficulties because its price fell beneath $160 while experiencing a 35% reduction in value during the past month ahead of an 11.2 million SOL token unlock on March 1. The sale of $1.78 billion tokens generates market concerns about intensified investor supply. According to market data from Santiment, the funding rate remains negative, which demonstrates trader anxiety. A demand-driven market recovery seems possible and could possibly create a new price target of $228.13.\nAvalanche strengthens its position in DeFi with rapid transaction speeds and interoperability. The platform processes thousands of transactions per second, appealing to developers building efficient applications. Despite a recent $506 million drop in stablecoin liquidity, as reported by Lookonchain, Avalanche’s energy-efficient consensus mechanism aligns with sustainability goals, enhancing its appeal in the blockchain space.\nMarket Trends Favor Crypto Innovation Technological market trends indicate that superior blockchain solutions will experience rising market demand.\nOzak AI leverages predictive AI trends by creating tools that let users optimize their portfolios and automate their trading operations. The secure Solana network continues to provide promising potential despite recent challenges, yet Avalanche focuses on improving scalability features with cross-chain collaboration. Top cryptos slated for investment today find substantial interest from investors who evaluate such projects.\nThe Ozak AI presale continues to be accessible at ozak.ai for prospective buyers who can access Solana and Avalanche through key cryptocurrency exchanges. Different cryptocurrencies contribute specific advantages that will revolutionize the financial technology systems of the future. These tokens emerge as outstanding contributors to the progressively evolving crypto realm of the sector.\nFor more information about Ozak AI, visit the links below:\nWebsite: https://ozak.ai/\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/OzakAGI\nTelegram: https://t.me/OzakAGI",

    "text": "By Doyle Rice, USA TODAY ,\n1 hours ago Winter's brutal grip is continuing Friday for millions across the eastern U.S. as temperatures remain well below average. Along with the cold, lake-effect snow is flying near the Great Lakes and an ice storm threatens portions of the central U.S.\nMeanwhile in the West, an atmospheric river event will bring very heavy rain, mountain snow, and gusty winds to portions of southern Oregon and northern/central California Friday into Saturday, the National Weather Service said.\nArctic plunge in the East High temperatures will remain cold and below average Friday for much of the north-central and eastern U.S.after a cold front passes through, the weather service predicted.\nForecast highs will range from the teens and 20s for the northern Plains, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast to the 50sacross the Southeast.\nSome good news: The Arctic plunge of air will quickly pivot eastward and then off the Atlantic coast this weekend, AccuWeather said. \"As the core of the coldest air shifts eastward, temperatures will begin to rebound in the Midwest as early as Friday, then (in) the East on Saturday,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said in an online forecast.\nLake-effect in the Great Lakes Most lake-effect snow in the Northeast is expected to taper off Friday morning except for areas downwind of Lake Ontario, where an additional 6-12 inches can be expected through the day Friday, according to the National Weather Service .\n\"Travel will be very difficult with deep snow cover on roads and very poor visibility,\" the weather service warned.\nERIE, PENNSYLVANIA - DECEMBER 12: Cars drive in near whiteout lake-effect snow on Interstate 79 on December 12, 2024 in Erie, Pennsylvania. Heavy snow, falling temperatures, and wind chills are forecast for Erie County. The weather service notes that travel could be difficult at times, and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has activated vehicle restrictions on interstates in northwestern Pennsylvania. (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) Jeff Swensen, Getty Images Iowa ice storm Snow, sleet, and freezing rain will impact portions of the Central Plains through the Upper Midwest beginning tonight, the weather service said. Freezing rain is expected to be the most significant hazard, with as much as 0.25 inch of ice accumulating.\nEast-central Iowa, including the city of Cedar Rapids, is in the region where the most ice is expected.\n\"Some power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and wind,\" the weather service in Des Moines said. \"Travel could be nearly impossible as roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will become slick and hazardous tonight into Saturday morning.\n\"Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury,\" the weather service said.\nWestern storms A pair of storms forecast to roll ashore at the end of the week has the potential to trigger significant power outages and travel problems from California to Washington, AccuWeather meteorologists say. Rain, snow, and wind will all be in the forecast over the next couple of days.\nRainfall totals of 3-5 inches, with isolated higher amounts upwards of 7 inches, may lead to some instances of flooding during the height of the event Friday evening/overnight into Saturday morning, the weather service said.\nIn addition, \"winds can become strong enough in portions of northern and central California and western Washington and southern British Columbia to trigger local to regional power outages,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Adam Douty said in an online forecast.\nVery heavy mountain snow is also expected at higher elevations (generally over 5000-6000 feet) of the Coastal Ranges and for the Sierra Nevada, the weather service said. Winter storm warnings have been issued for forecast snowfall totals of 1-2 feet, locally higher.\nLittle to no rain is likely in Southern California from the storm farther north in the state this weekend, AccuWeather added.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Friday forecast: Snow, ice, rain, wind wreak havoc\nBe the first to react",
