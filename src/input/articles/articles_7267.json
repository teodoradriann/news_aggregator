    "text": "MIDLANDS, S.C. (WACH) - A South Carolina woman is celebrating life this holiday season, and a whole lot of it.\nDoreatha Bishops just turned 109 surrounded by loved ones and friends.\nBirthday wishes and love filled Barnwell State Park as everyone celebrated Bishops.\n“It means everything to, it’s just a blessing I was able to witness this great milestone for someone who has lived 109 years old,” her daughter Mary Frank said.\nAlthough Bishop is 109, Frank said she’s still doing chores around the house.\n“The days she feels like washing the dishes I let her do it, I let her do what she wants to do,” Frank said.\nFrank said Bishop is also known for her cooking and to have a sweet tooth.\n“She loves sweets, she eats her sweets before she eats her meal,” Frank said.\nFamily and friends have a lot of positives to say about Bishop and her life.\nFrank thanks her mother for being an inspiration.\n“She always says that it is better to give than to receive, she always said that,” Frank said.\nAnd that fits right in with the spirit of this season of giving.\nCopyright 2023 WACH via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "GU Predictions: Here’s What Might Shake Up Society In 2024 The best part about the new year is embracing and looking forward to the unknown of pop culture. Last year, we witnessed many surprises, from Sexyy Red’s pregnancy to watching Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé. Now that 2024 is here, it’s time to see what our new favorite moment will be to take over the timeline. For instance, is the Beyhive lucky enough to see Beyoncé again after last year’s Ticketmaster fiasco? January is the time to assemble your wildest predictions to see what happens in the summer months if your manifestations come true. Now that we’re in a new year, we have a fresh start to manifest and conspire on many questions. What will be the next trending song? Who’s sweeping during award season? What is the following makeup look everyone will emulate? Long story short, we’re here to share some of our best forecasts for pop culture. No matter how wild or out of reach they seem, all we can do is hope for the best and see if any of the following fortunes happen by the end of the year. Here at Girls United, our time has compiled an in-depth list of all of our predictions for 2024, from music to glam, that we’ll look back on this time next year to see who was the big winner and who is still on hiatus. Check out some of our boldest projections for our favorite brands and artists for the new year, and bookmark this to see if any of these were on your bingo card for 2024. Lips Are The Main Character Last year, we saw unique lip looks like Sophia Sinot’s be integrated into traditional glam, making for one-of-a-kind beauty moments. From frosted lips to creative liner silhouettes — perfecting the perfect lip will become a staple. Bows Are Back In Style Dainty ribbon bows completely took over the holiday season. From ponytails to Christmas trees, they were a starlit touch to any look. However, their season is not over yet. I’d say they’re placed at number 10 on the trendy scoreboard, and we will see additional color variations and sizes, even on shoes and clothing. The bows are back. Megan Thee Stallion Achieves Solo #1 Billboard Hit As we know, Megan Thee Stallion is officially an independent artist after parting ways with her label 1501. She now has the freedom to create the music she’s always wanted to. Thus, the prediction of her gaining a solo number-one hit came to fruition. With her single “Coba” making waves, it’s easy to see Megan finally getting that top hit. Barbie Wins Oscar For Best Movie The heavily nominated film that instantly rose to the top of the charts for its nostalgic flare and strong themes of womanhood that resonated with women across generations, we suspect Barbie will take home more than one Oscar win this year. Barbie is only the first of many films like it, and its recognition at this level only shows the growing appreciation for diverse themes in the entertainment industry. Tonal Glam Will Become A Happy Medium Coined by MUA Ani James, Tonal Glam instructs us to use colors that naturally appear in our skin tone for our eyeshadow, lips, blush, and even hair color. If you liked “Clean Girl” beauty but are missing glam elements, this one might be for you! Individualism Fashion Trends will always be fetch, but we must admit they don’t have a large hand in fashion like they used to. Gen Z and Gen Alpha are going in an individualist direction, breaking free from what society persuades them to buy. This heavily correlates to maximalism and layering, as fashion forwards throw together chaotic yet elaborate looks that somehow… work. Normani Releases Her Debut Album For dedicated Normani fans, it’s been a long time coming for the songstress, but this year could be when the “Wild Side” singer puts out a fresh body of work. The singer has been on hiatus for a while during 2023, and fans are speculating something coming this year and continuing to spotlight her visuals and artistry, building the momentum when she decides to drop new music. Decline In Skincare Overconsumption With the help of social media — particularly TikTok, the skincare market has become a billion-dollar industry. However, do we really need 10-step routines? In 2024, we predict many will take a break from being influenced, scale back, and see what works best for their skin without breaking the bank. Glee Gets A Reboot Get ready to hit some high notes. With “remake culture” showing up heavily in 2023, we suspect that the next television show to join the ranks of fan-favorite reboots will be the musical masterpiece that was Glee. What could be a better addition to join the ranks alongside recent shows like Gossip Girl and Sex and the City? Coming up on the tenth anniversary of its series finale, now sounds like the perfect time to bring everyone’s favorite high school club back to life. Elevated Workwear 2024 marks the return to the office era, and while millennials paved the way for workwear to be more lenient, the officewear aesthetic will return. From slouchy trousers to fitted chicos or light knits to cardigans, dressing sophisticated at work will become the new norm rather than touching the boundary of a happy hour look. Chloe x Halle Release Third Studio Album The sirens have been waiting for new Chloe x Halle music after the duo took a break to maneuver their solo careers, but since their 2020 release, time has been bubbling for fans to hear what the sisters have in store sonically. Now that the pair has experienced their separate journeys, the time has come for them to remind the general public how we fell in love with them through their joint music.",

But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Copa del Rey\nBudimir apea al campeón\nOsasuna conquista Sam Mamés (2-3) con dos goles del croata y avanza a cuartos de final\nEFE\nEl Club Atlético Osasuna se clasificó para los cuartos de final de la Copa del Rey al imponerse por 2-3 al vigente campeón, el Athletic Club, después de adelantarse 0-2 en el marcador y sobrevivir a la remontada bilbaína hasta el empate a dos con un tanto de Ante Budimir que desniveló definitivamente la eliminatoria.\nAbrió el marcador en un tramo final de la primera mitad que se volvió loco Aimar Oroz con un golazo a pase de Jesús Areso y Budimir amplió distancias para los suyos transformando desde los once metros un penalti de Julen Agirrezabala al propio internacional croata.\nEl Athletic igualó la contienda con goles de Nico Williams, en un jugada de su hermano, y Oscar de Marcos, a un buen pase de Mikel Jauregizar, este ya en la segunda mitad; y Budimir decantó definitivamente la eliminatoria recogiendo un rechace de Agirrezabala a un tiro abajo de Rubén García.\nA poco del final el meta visitante, Sergio Herrera, tuvo que retirarse en camilla, conmocionado pero consciente, tras recibir un rodillazo involuntario en la cabeza de su compañero Enzo Boyomo,\nSin los lesionados Oihan Sancet y Bryan Zaragoza, los dos equipos arrancaron el partidos dispuesto a plantar cara al rival. El Athletic decidido a meter ritmo y a Osasuna en su campo y el conjunto navarro a evitar ambas cosas.\nEn esa dinámica, más allá de acercamientos peligrosos a ambas áreas, las mejores ocasiones fueron locales. Primero un centro chut de Guruzeta que iba a portería si Herrera hubiese acabado metiendo un mano muy valiosa para enviarlo a córner, y después un disparo desde la frontal de Iñaki Williams que el meta visitantes despejó también a saque de esquina en una intervención similar.\nParecía que el choque, que Osasuna trataba de que no se jugase mucho retrasando continuamente sus saques, se iba a ir a descanso sin goles y sin mayor interés hasta que se volvió loco en el tramo final el primer tiempo.\nBudimir, protagonista\nOsasuna se adelantó 0-2 en cuatro minutos con un golazo de Oroz a centro de Areso desde la banda y otro de Budimir transformando un claro penalti de Agirrezabal sobre él mismo tras una mala cesión de Paredes al meta local.\nDos tantos a los que respondió en el tiempo añadido el Athletic con un gol de Nico Williams enganchando un zapatazo a la red a un balón que tocó Guruzeta en un centro desde de la derecha del otro Wiliams, Iñaki.\nBuenos disparos de Aimar y Nico para marcar, aunque el del osasunista primoroso.\nComo impulsado por el 1-2, el Athletic salió en la segunda mitad como poseído a por el empate y no dejó de plantarse ante Herrera, al que amenazaron Yeray, Iñaki y Jauregizar antes de que le batiese De Marcos en la jugada del 2-2. Un desmarque tremendo del capitán a un pase lejano perfecto de Jauregizar.\nDe haber estado más finos en dos buenos cabezazos que cazó en el área, el joven medio centro de Bermeo podría haberse coronado esta noche en 'La Catedral'.\nParecía llegar el tercero de los locales con Osasuna desbordado, pero no. Lo que se dio fue el tercer tanto visitante. Rubén García caracoleó en el área, buscó a Agirrezabala en el primer palo, el portero no blocó la pelota y Budimir la rebañó para mandarla a la red con la tranquilidad que exigía la acción.\nSe repuso el Athletic y volvió a abordar la meta visitante, aunque ya sin tanta insistencia y tanto brío. Aún así generó varias ocasiones claras en las que sus delanteros no estuvieron finos.\nVanos intentos del Athletic\nSí Williams, al que Herrera le detuvo el disparo cruzado; pero no Guruzeta, que se enredó en un perfecto centro de Yuri, ni Berenguer, que buscó el segundo palo cuando sus compañeros esperaban su centro desde la línea de fondo por dentro.\nBuscaron más jugadas los leones peor el choque se les fue yendo ante su poco acierto. Por medio, Herrera dio el susto al tener que retirarse en camilla, conmocionado pero consciente, tras recibir un rodillazo involuntario en la cabeza de su compañero Boyomo.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil\nFC Barcelona - Real Betis, en directo: resultado y goles en vivo | Copa del ReyLa renovación de Pep Guardiola con el City, clave en el fin de su matrimonio con Cristina SerraNovedades en el caso NegreiraEl Como quiere fichar a Álex ValleLa mujer de Vitor Roque le pide el divorcio tras un año de matrimonio: 'No podía salir ni a comprar comida para los perrosEl Gobierno anuncia cambios en el impuesto de sucesiones y donaciones: todo lo que has de saber en 2025Cumbre decisiva por RashfordLos posibles rivales del Barça en cuartos de final de la Copa del Rey",

    "text": "El Espectador es el periódico más antiguo del país, fundado el 22 de marzo de 1887 y, bajo la dirección de Fidel Cano, es considerado uno de los periódicos más serios y profesionales por su independencia, credibilidad y objetividad. [Visitar sitio](https://www.elespectador.com) La empresa tecnológica maneja un catálogo de herramientas laborales muy completo. Su Workspace, que trae Gmail, Drive, Meet, Docs, Calendar, y otras aplicaciones más, es utilizado por millones de usuarios a nivel mundial. Entre una de sus grandes apuestas presentadas en el evento, se orienta a la creación del video, en ese sentido, presentaron Vids. La aplicación de Google, que [comenzaría a cobrar por usar su buscador](https://www.pulzo.com/tecnologia/google-empezaria-cobrarle-usuarios-usar-su-motor-busqueda-PP3563871A), permite desarrollar guiones y crear o producir productos audiovisuales compatibles con las aplicaciones de la plataforma. Thomas Kurian, director general de Google Cloud, afirmó que “Vids se lanzará en breve en Workspace Labs y esperamos dar acceso a todos los clientes para finales de este año”. La nueva herramienta pretende ayudar a empresas y usuarios a crear videos colaborativos más fáciles de compartir. (Vea también: [La IA generativa ahora crea listas de reproducción personalizadas en Spotify](https://www.elespectador.com/tecnologia/la-ia-generativa-ahora-crea-listas-de-reproduccion-personalizadas-en-spotify/?outputType=amp)) Por su parte, la directora de Google Workspace, Aparna Pappu, explicó que Vids es “un asistente de vídeo, escritura, producción y edición, todo en uno. Puede generar un guion gráfico fácilmente editable y, después de elegir un estilo, crea un primer borrador a partir de escenas sugeridas con vídeos de archivo, imágenes y música de fondo. También puede ayudar a completar tu mensaje con la voz de narración adecuada, ya sea eligiendo una nuestra preestablecida o utilizando la del usuario”. Para ejemplificar sus funciones, podemos pensar en la forma de hacer las presentaciones grupales o explicar un concepto complejo. El objetivo de Google, que [ofreció cursos gratis](https://www.pulzo.com/economia/google-ofrece-cursos-gratis-con-certificacion-requisitos-como-aplicar-PP3545825A), es facilitar estas tareas a sus usuarios mediante Vids. Kristina Behr, Vicepresidenta de gestión de productos, afirmó que “Nuestra filosofía es que si puedes hacer una diapositiva, puedes hacer un vídeo en Vids”. (Lea también: [Google lanza ‘Encontrar mi dispositivo’ con localización offline y compatibilidad](https://www.elespectador.com/tecnologia/google-lanza-encontrar-mi-dispositivo-con-localizacion-offline-y-compatibilidad/?outputType=amp)) Como se muestra en el video de presentación, los usuarios tendrán que generar las instrucciones y el contenido, la creación la realizará Vids. Para probar la aplicación se puede utilizar a Gemini, que puede generar guiones, gráficos, la lectura del guion y crear imágenes para utilizar en el video. Al compartir la creación del video, las personas podrán comentar, dejar notas e incluso editar el video ellos mismos. Google, que [hizo importante anuncio a sus usuarios](https://www.pulzo.com/tecnologia/google-2026-perdera-25-sus-visitantes-por-inteligencia-artificial-PP3486327), tiene previsto lanzar Vids en una beta pública este verano. Algunos clientes de Workspace ya lo han estado probando. Behr dice que ya está viendo el surgimiento algunas tendencias, la mayoría de los Vids son cortos, menos de tres minutos. La mayoría son lanzamientos, vídeos de formación, actualizaciones y vídeos que celebran logros o personas. Más novedades de IA en Google Gemini 1.05 Pro: Google habilitó al público la nueva actualización de su asistente de inteligencia artificial en el evento empresarial. La gran característica es la opción de escuchar audios que se suban a la aplicación. Esta función permite resúmenes de llamadas de voz o videos sin necesidad de una transcripción. La presentación oficial de la actualización se realizó en febrero. Imagen 2: La competencia con OpenAI ha impulsado los avances de los dos grandes empresas tecnológicas. Sora es la herramienta de ChatGPT que logra crear videos cortos a partir de un texto de instrucciones. Google decidió hacer frente presentado la versión preliminar de Imagen 2, un modelo de IA para crear videos cortos a partir de órdenes de texto.
