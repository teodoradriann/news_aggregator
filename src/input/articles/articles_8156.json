    "title": "The Mission review: Devotion leads an American missionary to his death in the Andamans",
    "text": "The Mission review: Devotion leads an American missionary to his death in the Andamans\nOne of the most gut-wrenching scenes in all of modern cinema comes at the end of Werner Herzog’s 2005 documentary, Grizzly Man. The film tells the tragic story of Timothy Treadwell, an outdoorsy American man who made the mistake — as so many of Herzog’s protagonists do — of staring into the abyss without bothering to consider the consequences. Treadwell was killed by a grizzly bear that he’d deluded himself into thinking he could tame. They recovered audio of the fatal attack, which Herzog listens to on camera in the film, but crucially, restricts from the audience. It distressed him to the point that he instructed Treadwell’s ex-girlfriend to destroy it immediately.\nDirectors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss perhaps came across a similar ethical dilemma in their new film, The Mission, which in many ways can be seen as a thematic companion piece to Grizzly Man. Like Herzog’s classic, the documentary follows the exploits of another adventurer — the Evangelical missionary John Allen Chau — who got more than what he bargained for after making illegal contact with the Sentinelese tribe in the Andaman Islands. The Sentinelese are perhaps the world’s most isolated community, having fended away almost all attempts at communication by the outside world.\nChau, a mixed-race American who grew up in the ‘90s, slowly became obsessed with the idea of converting the Sentinelese to Christianity. He believed that the island was Satan’s last great stronghold, and that only he could bring the Gospel of Christ to the 200-odd people who are said to live there. Chau wasn’t always a religious zealot, however. He grew up on The Adventures of Tintin and Robinson Crusoe, but found himself drifting away from conventional pop-culture in his teens, as he became completely entrenched in the Evangelical movement.\nChau’s life story is recounted in gorgeously animated sequences by his own father, who openly blames the Evangelicals for what happened to him. Chau was aware that the Indian government had forbidden all contact with the Sentinelese. He also knew that several past expeditions had ended with the Sentinelese giving clear warning signs to incoming explorers by aiming arrows at them. One of the most enduring images of the tribe — this also gives the film’s producers, National Geographic, a chance to offer internal critique about the west’s messiah complex — forever painting them as the savages in the eyes of the ‘civilised’ world.\nThe movie makes an honest attempt at capturing the complex blend of obsession, devotion, and delusion that sent John Allen Chau on his suicide mission. Perhaps the most interesting interviewee — the movie also features one of Chau’s old friends, and his many enablers from the Evangelical community — is the linguist Daniel Everett, who sees in Chau a kindred spirit, and harbours a vague sense of guilt over what happened to him. Everett spent decades with the Pirahã people of the Amazon, initially with the intention of teaching them the Lord’s ways. But in an unexpected turn of events, he found his own faith crumbling when the Pirahã started resisting his lessons.\nHe’s a fascinating character, someone who tears up at the mere memory of an old aphorism — “He gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.” — and freely admits that his three-decade mission might have been a waste of time. Whatever statements that The Mission is unable to make in literal terms, it makes by awarding Everett a large chunk of the screen time. But he isn’t a martyr, not like Chau.\nWe see endless self-shot footage of Chau climbing mountains, jumping into rivers, scurrying along narrow forest paths — visuals that could ostensibly project him as a ‘regular’ person. But Everett offers perhaps the film’s most sobering observation, when he warns that Chau’s reckless actions might inspire others to make similar illegal incursions into forbidden territory. It’s a dangerous proposition, and as one person keenly notes, none of this takes into consideration what the Sentinelese might want.\nThe Mission\nDirectors – Amanda McBaine, Jesse Moss\nRating – 4/5\nFor the latest news from across India, Political updates, Explainers, Sports News, Opinion, Entertainment Updates and more Top News, visit Indian Express.

    "title": "Ooredoo's Digital Reinvention: A Blueprint for Sustained Growth in the Evolving Telecom Landscape",
    "text": "Ooredoo's Digital Reinvention: A Blueprint for Sustained Growth in the Evolving Telecom Landscape\nThe telecom sector is undergoing a seismic shift as operators pivot from traditional connectivity providers to digital infrastructure powerhouses. Ooredoo Group, a regional leader in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation. Its first-half 2024 results and strategic initiatives reveal a company not just adapting to change but actively shaping it. For investors, the question is whether Ooredoo's aggressive digital reinvention and infrastructure investments can translate into durable revenue and profit growth in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nFinancial Performance: Stability Amid Strategic Shifts\nOoredoo's H1 2024 results reflect disciplined execution and a clear focus on margin expansion. Revenue grew 3% year-over-year to QAR 11.8 billion ($3.24 billion), driven by resilient demand for digital services and prudent cost management. More compelling is the 6% year-over-year increase in EBITDA to QAR 5.1 billion, with EBITDA margins improving to 43%—a one-point gain from 2023. This margin expansion is no accident. It underscores Ooredoo's strategic pivot to high-margin infrastructure and digital services, which now constitute a growing share of its revenue mix.\nNormalized net profit surged 14% to QAR 1.9 billion, outpacing revenue growth and signaling strong operating leverage. Free cash flow, a critical metric for capital allocation, rose 6% to QAR 4.1 billion, providing flexibility for reinvestment or shareholder returns. Meanwhile, Ooredoo's balance sheet remains robust, with a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.6x and QAR 11 billion in cash reserves. This financial discipline is a key enabler of its aggressive reinvention strategy.\nStrategic Catalysts: From Operator to Digital Infrastructure Ecosystem\nOoredoo's transformation is not merely about incremental improvements—it's a structural repositioning. The company is evolving into a telecom and infrastructure holding company, delayering its operations into specialized entities. This includes the launch of MENA Digital Hub, a carrier-neutral data center business that has already carved out assets in Qatar, Tunisia, and Kuwait. With a USD 1 billion investment roadmap, the hub aims to expand capacity to 120 megawatts and become a regional leader in sustainable data centers.\nThe partnership with NVIDIA is another pivotal move. By deploying thousands of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs in its data centers, Ooredoo is future-proofing its infrastructure for AI-driven workloads. This collaboration positions the company to capitalize on the global AI boom, a market expected to grow at a 37% compound annual rate through 2030. For investors, this is a critical inflection point: Ooredoo is no longer just selling bandwidth; it's selling the foundational infrastructure for AI and cloud computing.\nOn the fintech front, OFTI's 'walletii' app in Oman is a strategic bet on the region's underpenetrated digital payments market. With 60% of MENA's population unbanked or underbanked, OFTI's expansion into Kuwait, Iraq, and Tunisia could unlock significant value. This diversification into financial services also insulates Ooredoo from telecom-specific headwinds, such as regulatory pressures or slowing mobile ARPU.\nCapital Allocation and Operational Discipline\nOoredoo's CAPEX of QAR 1 billion in H1 2024 is concentrated in high-impact areas: 5G rollout, data center expansion, and AI-ready infrastructure. This aligns with its full-year guidance of QAR 3.5 billion in CAPEX, with spending accelerating in H2. The company's ability to maintain a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.6x—well below its 1.5x–2.5x target—demonstrates operational rigor. This fiscal prudence is critical for sustaining its transformation without compromising liquidity.\nThe disposal of Ooredoo Myanmar for QAR 1.3 billion in May 2024 further illustrates a value-focused strategy. By exiting non-core markets and reallocating capital to high-growth opportunities, Ooredoo is prioritizing returns over geographic reach. This approach mirrors the playbook of successful telecoms like Vodafone and AT&T, which have similarly exited underperforming markets to fund digital transformations.\nInvestment Implications: A High-Conviction Play on Digital Infrastructure\nOoredoo's H1 2024 performance and strategic momentum present a compelling case for long-term investors. The company is leveraging its telecom heritage to build a diversified digital infrastructure portfolio, with data centers, AI-ready networks, and fintech forming the pillars of its new business model. These initiatives are not speculative—they are backed by concrete capital commitments, partnerships, and regulatory progress.\nFor the risk-averse, Ooredoo's financial metrics are equally reassuring. With EBITDA margins expanding, free cash flow growing, and a fortress balance sheet, the company has the resilience to weather macroeconomic volatility. Its full-year guidance—stable revenue and EBITDA margins in the low 40s—suggests a measured approach to growth, avoiding the aggressive debt-fueled expansion that has derailed peers.\nConclusion: Building for the Future, Not Just the Present\nOoredoo's transformation is a masterclass in strategic reinvention. By doubling down on digital infrastructure, AI, and fintech, it's positioning itself as a critical node in the global digital economy. While the telecom sector faces challenges—saturation in legacy services and rising competition—Ooredoo is turning these headwinds into tailwinds.\nFor investors, the key takeaway is clear: Ooredoo is not just surviving in the evolving telecom landscape—it's building a moat around its future. With a strong balance sheet, a clear strategic vision, and the execution capability to back it up, the company offers a rare combination of near-term stability and long-term growth potential. In a world where digital infrastructure is the new oil, Ooredoo is positioning itself as a key producer.\nInvestment Recommendation: Buy with a long-term horizon. Ooredoo's strategic momentum and financial discipline make it a compelling play for investors seeking exposure to the digital infrastructure boom. Monitor its progress in the fintech sector and data center expansion for potential upside catalysts.\nComments\nNo comments yet",

    "text": "华尔街见闻\n　　马斯克旗下xAI的联合创始人 伊戈尔 ·巴布施金（Igor Babuschkin）周三在X的一篇文章中宣布离职。巴布施金曾领导xAI的工程团队，并在该公司成立短短几年内，帮助其发展成为硅谷领先的AI模型开发商之一。未来他将创办自己的风险投资公司Babuschkin Ventures，支持“推动人类进步和解开宇宙奥秘”的初创企业。\n　　北京时间8月14日， 埃隆·马斯克旗下初创公司xAI的联合创始人伊戈尔·巴布施金（Igor Babuschkin）周三在X的一篇文章中宣布离职。 他将创办自己的风险投资公司Babuschkin Ventures，支持人工智能安全研究，并支持“推动人类进步和解开宇宙奥秘”的初创企业。\n　　巴布施金曾领导xAI的工程团队，并在该公司成立短短几年内，帮助其发展成为硅谷领先的AI模型开发商之一。最新的Grok 4模型已经成为性能突出的前沿模型之一。\n　　巴布施金在帖子中写道：“今天是我在 xAI 的最后一天，这家公司是我和埃隆·马斯克在2023年共同创办的。我还记得第一次见到埃隆的那天，我们聊了好几个小时，谈论人工智能以及未来的发展方向。我们都觉得我们需要一家肩负不同使命的全新人工智能公司。”\n　　这位xAI 联合创始人表示，自己萌生创办风投公司的念头，是因为与未来生命研究所 （Future of Life Institute） 的创始人迈克斯·泰格马克 （Max Tegmark） 共进晚餐。\n　　“他给我看他年幼儿子的照片，并问我：‘我们如何才能安全地构建人工智能，以确保我们的孩子能够茁壮成长？’他的问题深深触动了我。”巴布施金在帖子中表示。\n　　对巴布施金的离职，马斯克回帖称：“感谢你帮助我们构建 @xAI ！没有你，我们就不会有今天。”\n　　 在离职的长篇帖子中，巴布施金还回顾了建设xAI时面临的挑战，以及团队并肩作战的重要时刻。 比如马斯克带队在120天内建成孟菲斯超算集群等。\n　　他坦言：“今天，当我驱车离开时，我感觉自己像一位骄傲的家长，正目送孩子远赴他乡去上大学。我的心中充满了喜悦的泪水，并由衷地为公司的成长与成熟喝彩。”\n　　巴布施金表示：“我从埃隆身上学到了两条无比宝贵的经验：第一，勇于亲身去解决技术难题，不要怕“卷起袖子”弄脏手；第二，保持一种近乎疯狂的紧迫感。”\n　　在联合创办 xAI 之前，巴布施金曾是谷歌 DeepMind 研究团队的一员，该团队于2019年率先推出了突破性的人工智能系统AlphaStar，该系统能够在电子游戏《星际争霸》中击败排名靠前的玩家。2023年，马斯克亲⾃挖⾓Igor Babuschkin，并让他担任xAI公司的总⼯程师。\n　　 以下是Igor Babuschkin在X上的发帖全文：\n　　今天，是我在 xAI 的最后一天。2023年，我与埃隆·马斯克 （Elon Musk） 共同创立了这家公司。我仍清晰地记得与埃隆初次见面的场景，我们畅谈数小时，从人工智能聊到未来图景。我们都认为，世界需要一家承载着不同使命的新型人工智能公司。\n　　打造能推动人类进步的人工智能，是我一生的梦想。苏联解体后，我的父母为了给孩子一个更好的未来，离开了俄罗斯联邦。作为移民，生活并非一帆风顺。但即便身处困境，父母依然坚信人类价值观的无价：比如勇气、同情心，以及探索和理解世界的好奇心。\n　　童年时，我无比崇拜理查德·费曼 （Richard Feynman） 和马克斯·普朗克 （Max Planck） 这样的科学家，他们为了理解宇宙，不懈地拓展着物理学的边界。在欧洲核子研究中心 （CERN） 攻读粒子物理学博士期间，我曾为能参与这一使命而激动万分。但新物理学的探索之路愈发艰难，需要越来越庞大的对撞机，新发现却越来越少。\n　　于是，我开始思索：解开宇宙之谜的钥匙，或许并非更大的对撞机，而是超级智能？人工智能能否发展出协调统一的量子引力理论？人工智能能否证明黎曼猜想 （Riemann hypothesis）？到2023年初，我愈发笃信，我们正在接近通往超级智能的秘方。\n　　我预见到了一个清晰的未来趋势：很快，人工智能的推理能力就将超越人类。我们该如何确保这项技术能被用于善途？多年来，埃隆一直在警示强大人工智能的危险。我们意识到，在“利用AI造福人类”这一点上，我们愿景相通。于是，我们招募了更多志同道合的工程师，共同踏上了创建 xAI 的征程。\n　　xAI 的初创岁月充满艰辛。曾有悲观者断言，我们入局太晚，从零开始打造一家顶级AI公司绝无可能。但我们坚信，我们能将不可能变为可能。白手起家意味着大量亲力亲为的工作。起初，我搭建了公司内部用于启动和管理训练任务的许多基础工具。后来，我负责监管公司的众多工程项目，包括基础设施、产品和应用AI。xAI 的同仁们都怀有极深的奉献精神。我们的团队付出了血水与汗水，以惊人的速度建成了孟菲斯超级计算机集群，并以前所未有的速度推出了前沿模型，这在历史上绝无仅有。\n　　 我从埃隆身上学到了两条无比宝贵的经验：第一，勇于亲身去解决技术难题，不要怕“卷起袖子”弄脏手；第二，保持一种近乎疯狂的紧迫感。\n　　xAI 以堪称荒谬的速度执行。业界元老们告诉我们，在120天内建成孟菲斯超算集群是天方夜谭。但我们坚信，我们能将不可能变为可能。我们的目标是尽快让训练系统在孟菲斯集群上全速运转起来。在120天期限将至时，我们被机器间 RDMA 通信的神秘问题困扰得焦头烂额。埃隆决定亲赴数据中心，我们紧随其后。我们的基础设施团队半夜抵达孟菲斯，落地便立刻投入工作。在梳理了数万行的 lspci 输出后，我们终于找到了问题的根源——一个错误的 BIOS 设置。埃隆一直和我们并肩奋战到深夜。\n　　当训练任务终于成功运行时，埃隆在“凌晨4：20”发文庆祝我们的胜利，引得我们放声大笑。我永远忘不了那一夜飙升的肾上腺素，以及那种“我们并肩作战”的深厚情谊。我们上床休息时，感觉自己正亲身经历着生命中最激动人心的时刻。\n　　我对 xAI 这个大家庭的每一位成员，都怀有深深的热爱。我们的团队是如此与众不同——你们是我共事过最专注、最投入的一群人。能如此迅速地追赶至行业前沿，过程殊为不易。\n　　这一切都归功于每个人的坚韧不拔和团队精神。感谢每一位曾与我并肩冒险的伙伴。我想向你们的贡献、你们的时间、你们的牺牲致敬，这一切都来之不易。我会永远记得我们一同工作到深夜、挑灯夜战的时光。我永远不会忘记你们做出的牺牲与贡献。\n　　今天，当我驱车离开时，我感觉自己像一位骄傲的家长，正目送孩子远赴他乡去上大学。我的心中充满了喜悦的泪水，并由衷地为公司的成长与成熟喝彩。\n　　在迈向人生新篇章之际，我父母为了给孩子寻求更美好世界而移民的经历，给了我新的启发。最近，我与未来生命研究所 （Future of Life Institute） 的创始人迈克斯·泰格马克 （Max Tegmark） 共进晚餐。他给我看他年幼儿子的照片，并问我：“我们如何才能安全地构建人工智能，以确保我们的孩子能够茁壮成长？”他的问题深深触动了我。\n　　在职业生涯早期，我曾是 DeepMind 的星际争霸智能体 AlphaStar 的技术负责人，亲眼见证了强化学习在规模化后的强大威力。随着前沿模型在更长的时间跨度、更广泛的任务范围内变得更具“代理性”（agentic），它们将拥有越来越强大的能力，这也使得研究和推进AI安全变得至关重要。我想继续我的使命，去实现一个对全人类安全、有益的人工智能。\n　　在此，我宣布启动Babuschkin Ventures。它将支持AI安全研究，并投资那些致力于推动人类进步、解开宇宙之谜的人工智能和代理系统初创公司。\n　　奇点临近，但人类的未来一片光明！\n　　 来源： 智能超参数 ，原文标题：《xAI联合创始人、总工程师宣布离职，称“奇点临近”》\n　　风险提示及免责条款\n　　市场有风险，投资需谨慎。本文不构成个人投资建议，也未考虑到个别用户特殊的投资目标、财务状况或需要。用户应考虑本文中的任何意见、观点或结论是否符合其特定状况。据此投资，责任自负。",

    "text": "HUELVA, 1 (EUROPA PRESS)\nLa Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha vuelto a ampliar, en este caso hasta las 15,00 horas de este viernes, 1 de noviembre, el aviso rojo por lluvias en el litoral de Huelva, mientras que en las comarcas de Aracena, Andévalo y Condado el aviso continúa siendo naranja por lluvias y amarillo por tormentas.\nAsí lo han indicado a Europa Press desde el servicio de Emergencias 112 Andalucía. La Aemet prevé que en el litoral de Huelva la precipitación acumulada en doce horas ha sido de 140 litros por metro cuadrado, y se estima que continúen con \"gran intensidad\" las lluvias en la zona de aviso \"durante las próximas horas\".\nDe otro lado, en la zona de Aracena la precipitación acumulada en una hora es de 30 litros por metro cuadrado, al igual que en el Andévalo y en el Condado onubense. Asimismo, el 112 ha indicado que las incidencias rozan ya el centenar, y que los últimos avisos se han dado en La Antilla (Lepe), Isla Cristina y Cartaya, nuevamente por anegaciones en sótanos y entrada de agua en viviendas.\nPor otra parte, el alcalde de Punta Umbría, José Carlos Hernández Cansino, ha remitido un audio a los medios informando de que la noche ha sido \"tensa\" con grandes lluvias y tormentas eléctricas, así como ha subrayado que las precipitaciones han sido de \"119 litros por metro cuadrado\".\nAl respecto, ha apuntado que \"no hay que destacar daños especiales, nada más que daños en algunos bajos, algunas zonas de casas en las que ha entrado agua\" y \"calles que se han inundado, pero que ya prácticamente están volviendo a la normalidad\".\nEl alcalde de Punta Umbría, que ha pedido \"precaución\" a la población, ha explicado que \"han estado cortadas las carreteras de acceso a Punta Umbría, tanto la autovía que viene de Huelva como las que unen la zona de El Portil con Cartaya y la carretera de Malpica\", pero que \"ya se han abierto y han vuelto a la normalidad\", así como en la zona del Rincón ha habido \"algún problema más, porque el arroyo que discurre por allí se ha desbordado\", pero \"no hay que lamentar ningún tipo de daño personal\".\nEn Cartaya, el Ayuntamiento ha indicado en su cuenta de Facebook que está activo el Plan Local de Emergencias y que las lluvias han provocado el corte de algunos tramos de carretera que unen el municipio con su núcleo de El Rompido, así como se han registrado hundimientos e inundaciones en algunos tramos de calzada y principalmente en bajos y garajes en El Rompido y El Portil y el parking del hotel Nuevo Portil Golf.\nEl alcalde, Manuel Barroso, ha pedido a los ciudadanos \"precaución y responsabilidad\" y que, \"en la medida de lo posible\" eviten desplazamientos y sigan \"en todo momento\" las indicaciones de los Cuerpos y Fuerzas de Seguridad del Estado y de los dispositivos de emergencias que están trabajando \"para garantizar la seguridad ciudadana\".",

    "title": "DR Congo accuses Apple of using 'blood minerals' from war-torn east",
    "text": "The Tenke Fungurume mine, one of the largest sources of copper and cobalt in the world, in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo / © AFP The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo is accusing Apple of using \"illegally exploited\" minerals extracted from the country's embattled east in its products, lawyers representing the African country said Thursday. The DRC's lawyers have sent Apple a formal notice seen by AFP, effectively warning the tech giant that it could face legal action if the alleged practice continues. The Paris-based lawyers accused Apple of purchasing minerals smuggled from the DRC into neighbouring Rwanda, where they are laundered and \"integrated into the global supply chain\". Contacted by AFP, Apple pointed to statements from its 2023 annual corporate report regarding the alleged use of so-called conflict minerals that are crucial for a wide range of high-tech products. \"Based on our due diligence efforts... we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG (tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023, directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" it said. The DRC's mineral-rich Great Lakes region has been wracked by violence since regional wars in the 1990s, with tensions resurging in late 2021 when rebels from the March 23 Movement (M23) began recapturing swathes of territory. The DRC, the United Nations and Western countries accuse Rwanda of supporting rebel groups, including M23, in a bid to control the region's vast mineral resources, an allegation Kigali denies. \"Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave human rights violations,\" the DRC's lawyers wrote. Sexual violence, armed attacks and widespread corruption at sites providing minerals to Apple are just some of the claims levelled in the letter. Macs, iPhones and other Apple products are \"tainted by the blood of the Congolese people\", the DRC's lawyers said. -'Notoriously insufficient'- French lawyers William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth sent the formal notice this week to two Apple subsidiaries in France, and lawyer Robert Amsterdam send them to the tech company's US headquarters. \"Apple has consistently relied on a range of suppliers that buy minerals from Rwanda, a mineral-poor country that has preyed upon the DRC and plundered its natural resources for nearly three decades,\" they wrote. The DRC is rich in tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold –- often referred to as 3T or 3TG –- that are used in producing smartphones and other electronic devices. The tech giant's efforts to ethically source its minerals are \"notoriously insufficient\", Bourdon and Amsterdam wrote. \"Apple seems to rely mainly on the vigilance of its suppliers and their commitment to respect Apple's code of conduct,\" reads the official letter. But both their suppliers and external audits appear to rely on certification from the Tin Supply Chain Initiative (ITSCI), \"which has been shown to have numerous and serious shortcomings\", the formal notice said. The ITSCI programme is one of the main mechanisms set up over ten years ago to ensure the supply of \"conflict-free\" minerals in the DRC, according to the British NGO Global Witness. In April 2022, Global Witness accused ITSCI of contributing to the laundering of conflict minerals, child labour, trafficking and smuggling in the DRC. Apple is not the only major company relying on the \"flawed\" system, Global Witness said. Tesla, Intel and Samsung are among the companies that depend on ITSCI, but Global Witness's report revealed that \"ninety percent of the minerals\" from specific mining sites reviewed by the programme did not come from validated mines. The DRC's formal notice to Apple includes questions about \"3T minerals used in Apple products\" and demands that the tech company respond \"within three weeks\". \"All legal options are on the table,\" the lawyers told AFP. – 'Blood minerals' – Growing demand for cobalt and copper to power so-called clean energy, including rechargeable batteries, has also led to forced evictions, sexual assault, arson and beatings in eastern DRC, according to a 2023 Amnesty International Report. M23 rebels currently control large swathes of North Kivu and are encircling the provincial capital of Goma, where more than one million displaced by the war have crammed into desperate camps. The UN said in 2023 that people living in eastern DRC faced unheard-of violence, naming it one of the \"worst places\" in the world for children. Minerals are transported into Rwanda, where they are laundered to outmanoeuvre oversight meant to prevent the sale of \"conflict minerals\", according to Global Witness. \"The responsibility of Apple and other major tech manufacturers when they use blood minerals has for too long remained a black box,\" the lawyers told AFP.",
