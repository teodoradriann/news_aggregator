(HT/File ) (HT_PRINT) The Aam Aadmi Party praised the Supreme Court on Friday for granting interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy scam case filed by the Enforcement Directorate, asserting that this move has uncovered a BJP “conspiracy” against him.\nDespite being granted interim bail by the Supreme Court in the excise policy scam case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Arvind Kejriwal, the national convenor of the AAP, will remain in jail due to his subsequent arrest by the CBI in connection with a corruption case linked to the alleged scam. CBI arrested Kejriwal, who was under the ED's custody.\nIn a joint press conference, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, and Sandeep Pathak hailed the Supreme Court verdict as a “victory of truth.”\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, Delhi Minister Atishi says, \"...BJP knew that he (Arvind Kejriwal) has been granted bail by the Rouse Avenue Court, they know that he will get bail by the Supreme Court… pic.twitter.com/vVnh6C6Ziw\n— ANI (@ANI) July 12, 2024 Pathak said the Supreme Court's verdict is “definitely a relief”.\n\"When they can't stop this party, they jail all the leaders of the party. So, in such a situation, the Supreme Court order is very soothing. I believe that the party is not important; the country is. It is very important in the national interest that a dictator doesn't attempt to finish off a party like this. So, such decisions should be written in golden letters in the country's history,\" Pathak said.\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, AAP National General Secretary Organisation and MP Sandeep Pathak says, \"This is definitely a relief...

Today, the apex court said that this matter be referred to a larger bench so that it can't be found out if his arrest is right or wrong. I think the Supreme Court has given a huge jolt to the BJP. I thank the Court... I think Arvind Kejriwal will get bail in CBI, too, and he will be out of jail soon.”\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, Punjab minister Harpal Singh Cheema says, \"BJP has made a false case of excise policy scam by conspiring against several AAP leaders.

He told ANI that the law's bail provisions are so difficult that it is almost impossible to get bail.\n\"First, the lower court granted him bail and observed that ‘ED is acting with bias’. So, today's bail by the Supreme Court is a huge thing. Centre had anticipated that the Supreme Court would grant him bail in the ED matter. So, to ensure that he continues to be in jail even after bail, the CBI arrested him... The burden of proof lies on the CBI. So, I don't think there will be much issue. It's just a matter of time, Arvind Kejriwal will come out of jail,” he added.\nHow BJP reacted… Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha welcomed the court's decision and said, \"Both bail and punishment are given by the court. The NDA alliance has no role in this, but these people play the game of deceiving the public.”\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha says, \"This is the decision of the court, we welcome the decision of the court...

But it doesn't mean that Arvind Kejriwal has not done a scam or that he was not involved in corruption. Perhaps the Supreme Court has allowed him to be out and work as the people of Delhi suffer. But the court has not acquitted him,” she added.\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat says, \"Interim Bail is not a relief from the crime that one has committed.

    "text": "You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit\n[image gallery](/image_purchases) to purchase the image.\nWarning: This story discusses details of sexual abuse.\nFormer members of a secretive sect under investigation by the FBI for historical child sexual abuse warn it is a highly controlling and insular group with many unwritten rules.\nThe religious group has about 2500 members and 60 ministers in New Zealand, meets in homes and has no official name but is commonly known as Two by Twos or The Truth.\nIts spokesperson has confirmed police here are investigating at least one former minister for historical abuse and it is aware of 14 cases of allegations against members.\nThe sect is not registered as a charity, it has no buildings and members are encouraged to tick 'Christian non-denominational' on the census.\nElliot* recently left the church because of the way historical child abuse allegations were handled.\n\"In your article was more information than we'd ever been given as a church. I was concerned about the lack of accountability.\n\"There hasn't been a public spoken apology to the church from the workers, the ministers, to say these things have been handled really incorrectly in the past that has caused harm and we're sorry for the harm it's caused.\"\nElliot joined as a teenager and said the rules are subtle - you're not saved if you don't attend the sect's meetings in homes and hired halls, marrying an outsider is frowned upon, females have a dress code, TVs are not allowed and using the internet is actively discouraged.\"\nSarah* grew up in the sect, her parents were born into it too, but she left the church when she moved cities to attend university.\n\"I always felt very restricted by the very strict rules. There's a phrase they use which is 'be in the world but not of the world' so you're not meant to have school friends. I felt like I was living in these two really different worlds and I couldn't marry them up.\"\nThe sect's ministers travel in pairs within an area or region, staying in members' homes.\nThe church spokeperson Wayne Dean confirmed these ministers were police vetted and trained in keeping children safe, members were encouraged to report any abuse to police and any alleged offender is stood down from attending meetings pending investigation.\nSarah said that is not enough - she said the trust given to these ministers, also called Workers, creates a power imbalance.\n\"There's a culture of understanding that you don't go to the police to sort out any internal issues. If there had been any problematic behaviour before then the police wouldn't have probably been involved,\" she said.\n\"I was left alone with Workers my whole life when they were staying in my house, in their bedrooms. Nothing ever happened to me but I can absolutely see how it can happen. They are the most senior people.\"\nShe is concerned the secretive nature of the sect would make reporting any abuse difficult.\n\"I've seen another resurgence of people leaving, from what I understand promises were made that things were going to change and they haven't seen that come to be,\" Sarah said.\nAnother former insider said their family has been in the church for generations, but they left shortly after coming out as gay.\nThey were in contact with family still in the sect but are ignored by others.\n\"I feel like I have been shunned in a way. I'd see people I knew from growing up in the religion and they would just ignore me. To them I don't exist any more, these are people that I have known my whole life.\"\nReligious studies expert and Massey University professor emeritus of history Peter Lineham said former insiders he had talked to told him the sect is in crisis.\n\"What they seem to be implying is that there's been quite a big exodus of members over recent years. I think there's been much more public talk about the risks and dangers of secterian groups and a vulnerability of people within those groups.\"\nThe church keeps a low profile and Lineham said its response to RNZ, confirming a police investigation, was a \"striking development\".\n\"The 2x2s have kept such a low profile for so many years that in fact most people have never heard of them. With this sudden exposure I think it maybe has created a bit of a crisis.\"\nThe abuse scandal overseas\nThe lid was lifted on the scale of historical child sexual abuse within the sect after the leader of its church in the US state of Oregon, Dean Bruer, died in 2022.\nAn internal letter by his successor stating that Bruer was a \"sexual predator\" whose actions included \"rape and abuse of underage victims\" was leaked on social media, then shared to a website set up for victims of the abuse within the group.\nTwo women set up a hotline just over a year ago, and the floodgates opened - their February update said more than 1500 victims had come forward from around the world.\nThe sect, founded in Ireland in 1897, is believed to have 100,000 members worldwide, most in North America.\nOne of the former insiders RNZ spoke to for this story said they had spent time in South East Asia with their family, as missionaries.\nAnother said the ministers would travel overseas to attend conventions, and foreign ministers would also travel to New Zealand to speak at the annual gatherings.\nThe FBI declined to comment on whether it had alerted police in New Zealand to its investigation of the 2x2s sect, launched in February.\nIts Omaha Field Office said it was seeking the public's help in identifying victims or individuals with knowledge of abuse and/or criminal behaviour that had occurred within a religious group that traditionally has not had a name.\n\"The group has often been referred to by others outside of the group as \"2x2,\" \"The Way,\" \"The Truth,\" and \"The Church With No Name,\" among others,\" the FBI said.\n\"While it is natural for parents to want to gain a better understanding of the potential exploitation of their child, further questioning of the child may lead to inaccurate statements and increased emotional trauma.\"\nThe FBI asked people with information to fill out a short questionnaire.\n*Former insiders talked to RNZ about the group's secretive culture on condition of anonymity - these are not their names.\nWhere to get help:\nSexual Violence\nVictim Support 0800 842 846\nRape Crisis 0800 88 33 00\nHELP Call 24/7 (Akld): 09 623 1700, (Wgtn): 04 801 6655 - push 0 at the menu\nSafe to talk: a 24/7 confidential helpline for survivors, support people and those with harmful sexual behaviour: 0800 044 334\nSurvivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) 022 344 0496\nFamily Violence\nWomen's Refuge: 0800 733 843\nIt's Not OK 0800 456 450\nShine: 0508 744 633\nVictim Support: 0800 842 846\nHELP Call 24/7 (Auckland): 09 623 1700, (Wellington): 04 801 6655 - push 0 at the menu\nThe National Network of Family Violence Services NZ has information on specialist family violence agencies.\nAbuse survivors\nFor male survivors:\nRoad Forward Trust, Wellington, contact Richard 021 1181043\nBetter Blokes Auckland, 09 990 2553\nThe Canterbury Men's Centre, 03 377 6747\nThe Male Room, Nelson 03 548 0403\nMale Survivors, Waikato 07 858 4112\nMale Survivors, Otago 0211064598\nFor female survivors:\nHelp Wellington, 04 801 6655\nHelp, Auckland 09 623 1296\nFor urgent help: Safe To Talk 0800 044 334.",
