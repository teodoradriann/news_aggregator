    "title": "Get Vaccinated This Winter: Health Officials Urge High-Risk Groups to Protect Against Influenza and Covid-19",
    "text": "The Winter Vaccination Blitz: Get Your Jabs Out, Everybody! With winter breathing down our necks like an overenthusiastic dog wanting a game of fetch, the Secretary of Health , Nadine Gasman Zylbermann, is making a clarion call that echoes across the chilly air: “Get vaccinated!” Yes, folks, it’s that time of year again, where rolling up your sleeve takes on new meaning—especially if you’re over 60 or have a tiny human attached to your leg.\nWhy You Shouldn’t Ignore the Jab—Or Risk Getting Jabbed at the Checkout Queue! Our beloved Nadine is all about spreading the love—or should we say, the vaccines? “Covid is with very low numbers,” she says, which frankly sounds like something a parent would say when trying to justify why your teenage sibling got a B-. Nevertheless, she continues on a more hopeful note, “We hope to keep the numbers down like last year, because who doesn’t love a good duet of influenza and Covid-19?”\nYet, my dear readers, if you find yourself in the high-risk club—adults over 60, kids between 6 months and five years, and yes, even pregnant folks—now’s your time to shine! Get yourself over to the health services and roll that sleeve up like you’re preparing for a friendly wrestling match. Just think of it as an arm wrestling contest with a needle, but this time, you want to win!\nVaccination Campaign: Almost as Popular as a Pizza at a Kids’ Party! During a recent free breast reconstruction event—because nothing says winter prep quite like making sure everyone’s feeling fabulous—officials reported a whopping 600,000 vaccinations already given. That’s more than the number of pine trees planted in December, I dare say!\nBut hold your horses, because the fun doesn’t stick around forever! The campaign’s got an expiry date — like that old milk at the back of your fridge — running all the way until the end of February next year. So, make like a squirrel storing nuts for the winter and get your vaccine before the frost bites!\nAll Aboard the Vaccine Express! And what’s that? Good acceptance rates for both vaccines? According to Nadine, people are eagerly embracing the chance to get jabbed. Maybe it’s the thrill of the needle, or perhaps folks are just really running from those winter ailments like a kid from a scary clown at a birthday bash?\nIn many ways, getting the flu and Covid-19 vaccines feels like a rite of passage—like graduating from school or realizing that your body can no longer endure three-hour long Netflix binges without consequences. So, don’t be shy; show up, get vaccinated, and give that flu the old heave-ho!\nSo remember, my good citizens, winter’s coming, and with it comes the risk of not just snow and ice, but also nasty viruses lurking around. Do yourself and all of us a favor—stay healthy, and let’s show those diseases who’s boss this winter!\nAs winter approaches, the Secretary of Health of the capital, Nadine Gasman Zylbermann , strongly urged residents to get vaccinated against serious illnesses, including influenza and Covid-19. This recommendation is particularly crucial for individuals within vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.\n“Currently, Covid-19 case numbers are relatively low, but we expect a resurgence of both influenza and Covid-19 this winter, similar to what we experienced last year,” he stated. Gasman Zylbermann emphasized the importance of vaccination for high-risk groups, which include adults over 60, children aged between six months and five years, pregnant women, and individuals with existing health issues. He urged these populations to seek vaccination services as a proactive measure.\nDuring a complimentary breast reconstruction event at Rubén Leñero Hospital, the Secretary noted that the ongoing vaccination campaign in the capital has successfully administered vaccines to approximately 600,000 individuals so far.\nHe reminded everyone that the vaccination campaign will conclude at the end of February next year, highlighting the urgency for residents to receive their shots before the onset of the cold season to bolster their immunity against viruses.\nGasman Zylbermann pointed out that there has been a positive response from the community regarding the vaccination drive, as many have been actively coming forward to receive both the Covid-19 and influenza vaccines, underscoring a collective effort to safeguard public health.\n**Interview with Nadine Gasman Zylbermann, Secretary of Health**\n**Interviewer:** Welcome, Nadine! Exciting news about the winter vaccination campaign! Can you tell us why it’s so⁤ important for people—especially high-risk groups—to get vaccinated this season?\n**Nadine Gasman ⁢Zylbermann:** Absolutely! As winter approaches, the risk ​of influenza and COVID-19 infections increases. We’re ‍particularly concerned about those over 60, young children, and pregnant individuals. ‌Vaccination not only protects the person getting the shot but also helps reduce the spread of these viruses in our communities. We want to keep those numbers‍ down, just like we did last year, and vaccinating is our⁢ best shot at achieving ⁣that!\n**Interviewer:** On that note,‌ you mentioned that you hope to keep ⁣the infection rates low. How have people been‍ responding to the campaign so far?\n**Nadine Gasman Zylbermann:** The response has been quite positive! We’ve seen​ a strong uptake⁢ of vaccinations—over 600,000 doses already administered! It’s heartening to see people stepping up and taking proactive measures for their health. It ​almost feels​ like community spirit is in the air as ​we all⁢ work together to defeat ‌these bugs!\n**Interviewer:** That’s ‍great to hear! But ‌with an ⁣expiry date on the ​campaign‍ until the ‍end⁤ of February, what do ⁤you say to those​ who might be reluctant to get vaccinated?\n**Nadine Gasman Zylbermann:** I would ​say—don’t wait! Think of it as an‍ important winter checklist. Just like you wouldn’t leave your snow tires on until after the first storm, you shouldn’t put off your vaccination.⁣ The sooner ⁣you get your shot, the sooner you’re⁣ protected. Remember, preventing illness means fewer hospital‍ visits and less strain on our health services.\n**Interviewer:**⁣ Excellent ⁢point! It sounds like there’s⁣ a sense of urgency in getting these vaccinations done. So, what ⁣final message do you have ​for our listeners?\n**Nadine Gasman Zylbermann:**⁤ Winter’s coming, and it can bring ⁣with it more than just cold weather. By getting vaccinated,‍ you’re not just doing yourself a favor, but also looking out⁢ for your family and community. Let’s ‌tackle⁣ this winter together, stay healthy, and make sure we’re ready for whatever comes our way!\n**Interviewer:** ⁢Thank ⁣you,‍ Nadine! Wise words indeed. Remember, everyone, roll up those ⁤sleeves and make ‌it a healthy winter!",

    "text": "Rain has seen the second T20 between the Black Caps and Bangladesh abandoned after just 11 overs of play. Despite a worrying forecast and gloomy skies, play had begun on time at Mount Maunganui's Bay Oval. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bowl, looking to build upon their excellent start with the ball in the first T20 on Wednesday. It appeared to be another shrewd decision, as Finn Allen chipped Shoriful Islam straight to cover in the second over to depart for just 2. But after Tim Seifert survived being hit in the helmet by a booming Daryl Mitchell drive that came straight at him at the non-striker's end, the Northern Districts opener found a new lease of life, racing to 43 off 22 before being deceived by a slower ball from Tanzim Hasan Sakib and holing out to mid off. The Bangladesh spinners then turned the screws to stifle Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips, before the players left the field when a shower swept across the ground. New Zealand were 72/2 from the 11 overs, with Mitchell not out on 18 and Phillips unbeaten on 9. While it briefly appeared hopeful that play would resume, the clouds rolled in and dumped unrelenting rain that ruined any chance of a result. Despite the game finishing without a result, Seifert was pleased to get some time in the middle. \"I think we did pretty well and got off to a good start. \"You’re not going to get off to a good start all the time, but it’s always nice to back it up the next game. It was unfortunate to get out at that stage but I wanted to keep putting pressure on them because I think we had them in a good position.\" The teams will return to the same ground on Sunday for the third and final T20 in the series. The Black Caps will need to win in order to draw the series. Bangladesh meanwhile will be hoping to secure their first ever series win on New Zealand shores, something that spinner Rishad Hossain said excited the team. \"It’s a great opportunity and looking forward to it. It’s a great atmosphere playing against New Zealand in New Zealand. It’s not an easy job, I think the boys are doing well and we’re looking forward to the third game.\" Follow the summer of cricket [with TVNZ](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/sport/cricket) this summer.",

    "title": "Scrub Typhus Bacteria Detected in NC Chiggers: A Public Health Concern",
    "text": "A study in North Carolina has detected the bacterium responsible for scrub typhus, a serious disease, in local chiggers. The findings prompt concerns about the disease’s origins and potential health risks, with further research underway to assess the implications. A bacterium that causes a disease called scrub typhus – a disease not previously reported in the United States – has been detected in North Carolina, according to a new study by researchers at North Carolina State University and UNC-Greensboro. The researchers stress that scrub typhus, which can cause fever, headache, and body aches – and can be fatal if left untreated by antibiotics – has not yet been detected in animals or people in the state. Research Methodology and Findings The NC State researchers detected the bacterium – the genus is Orientia in the family Rickettsiaceae – at a high frequency while testing free living, larval (ready to bite) trombiculid mites, commonly called chiggers, in several different recreational parks in North Carolina. “We wanted to see if chiggers in the United States carried Orientia,” said Loganathan Ponnusamy, an NC State principal research scholar in entomology and co-corresponding author of a paper that describes the research. “We haven’t in the past had the diagnostic tools to test for this specific bacterium at the genus level.” “We set a black tile on the ground in 10 different North Carolina state parks and picked up chiggers as they crossed the tile. Microbiome studies allowed us to characterize all the bacteria in the chiggers. One park showed a 90% positivity rate for the bacterium (nine out of 10 chiggers captured); another showed an 80% positivity rate (eight of 10 chiggers captured). Other parks showed positivity rates of just 10%.” Chiggers as Vectors for Disease Transmission Trombiculid mites are only parasitic in their larval stage. They search for vertebrate hosts – including humans – to bite, Ponnusamy says. “Chiggers can spread bacteria to people or rodents when they bite but can also pass bacteria to future generations of mites through their eggs,” he added. The researchers say that scrub typhus presents symptoms similar to those of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a disease generally ascribed to tick bites. Global Spread and Uncertainties Scrub typhus is found more commonly in Asia and the Pacific, but in recent years has been detected in Africa and the Middle East. It is uncertain whether spread is caused by people or goods carrying chiggers from one place to another. “We don’t know if this is a recent introduction into the state or if the bacterium has been here for years,” said R. Michael Roe, William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and co-author of the paper. “We also don’t know if the infected chiggers found in North Carolina actually will cause disease; this has to be determined in future work.” Ongoing Research and Future Directions “We also don’t have information about whether the chigger infection rate is decreasing or increasing,” said Kaiying Chen, a postdoctoral research scholar at NC State and lead author of the paper. The NC State and UNC-Greensboro researchers are resampling chiggers in the recreational park sites to see if the reported findings remain consistent.

La CGT convocó a un paro general por la Ley Ómnibus y Eduardo Feinmann estalló: “Todo un récord” Será así como en el día de mañana se realizará la presentación de un recurso de amparo contra el Decreto de Necesidad y Urgencia (DNU), mientras que también en señal de reclamo bajarán sus persianas durante una hora ante la medida que indicaron: “Lleva a la destrucción a la profesión farmacéutica”. Según explicó el presidente de la entidad, Ricardo Pesenti: “Esta no es una medida política; de hecho, muchos farmacéuticos votaron a este gobierno. Sin embargo, creemos que hay desconocimiento de las consecuencias graves que trae este DNU”, mientras que también reveló que se realizará una concentración frente al Palacio de Tribunales. Por otro lado, Pesenti agregó que: “Con el argumento falso de bajar el precio de los medicamentos, el DNU lleva a la destrucción de la profesión farmacéutica, minando 20 artículos de la Ley 17.565 de ejercicio profesional”. A través del DNU 70/2023 se presentó una modificación de la ley 17.565 en la cual se eliminaba que “los medicamentos denominados de venta libre y de especialidades farmacéuticas, cualquiera sea su condición de expendio, sólo podrán ser efectuadas en todo el territorio de la Nación, en farmacias habilitadas”. El comunicado de la COFA tras el DNU de Javier Milei En un duro comunicado realizado por la Confederación Farmacéutica Argentina (COFA) se expresó: “La profesión farmacéutica ha sido profundamente afectada y gravemente agredida por el Decreto de Necesidad y Urgencia 70/23 emitido ayer por el Poder Ejecutivo. Esta medida pone en riesgo la salud de la población y el acceso de todos a los medicamentos”. Javier Milei desafió a la oposición tras la Ley Ómnibus con una contundente reflexión: “Eso se llama envidia” Además, también indicaron: “Mediante el DNU se permite que cualquier persona sin título habilitante pueda estar a cargo de la farmacia. Es decir que no habrá un profesional que garantice, bajo su responsabilidad, la calidad, origen y seguridad de los medicamentos que se dispensan. El DNU 70/23 atenta gravemente contra la salud de la población, la profesión farmacéutica y el modelo de farmacia profesional”.",
