    "text": "SHAH ALAM: The Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, yesterday graced the official opening of the Kota Kemuning Mosque in Kota Kemuning here. Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari and the State Secretary Datuk Haris Kasim greeted His Highness, who was accompanied by Tengku Permaisuri of Selangor Tengku Permaisuri Norashikin, upon arrival at 6 pm. Also present were the Minister of Investment, Trade, and Industry, Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, State Youth, Sports, and Entrepreneurship Committee chairman Mohd Najwan Halimi, State Housing and Culture Committee chairman Borhan Aman Shah, Selangor Islamic Religious Council chairman Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof and the Selangor Islamic Religious Department director, Datuk Mohd Shahzihan Ahmad. During the ceremony, Sultan Sharafuddin also presented Aidilfitri contributions of RM500 each to 476 recipients comprising asnaf, the poor and converts from the Klang district, totalling RM238,000. Sultan Sharafuddin then accepted business zakat contributions from Pintas Utama Sdn Bhd and Rafulin Holdings Sdn Bhd, amounting to RM3 million and RM1.88 million respectively. His Highness also delivered the inauguration speech for the Kota Kemuning Mosque before signing the plaque to conclude the ceremony. Built to accommodate the Kota Kemuning congregation, who previously performed their prayers at An-Naim Mosque, Jalan Kebun, construction works for the mosque began in 2017 on a five-acre land. It was completed in November 2022 with a total cost of RM18 million and can accommodate up to 4,000 worshippers. During the ceremony, His Highness also launched the Selangor-Gaza Development Fund. In conjunction with Nuzul Al-Quran today, a special lecture was delivered by Dr Muhammad Ayman Al Akiti, a lecturer at the Department of Usuluddin and Comparative Religion at the International Islamic University Malaysia. Sultan Sharafuddin also performed the Maghrib, Isyak, and Tarawih prayers with the people.",

The party gave attendees the chance to meet Schattschneider and enjoy live performances, and was a kick-start to the 2025 Summer Moon Festival.\nSchattschneider said it means everything to her to celebrate the album's release in her hometown.\n“I’ve said it time and time again, but this town is really where I found my love for music and also where I felt just unconditional support from everyone around me, so to be back here just feels absolutely perfect,” Schattschneider said.\nSchattschneider now lives in Nashville where she is a live and session vocalist and vocal contractor. She is known for her unique and versatile sound, and she has worked with famous artists across country, jazz, worship songs and more. Schattschneider is also a production manager for many professional recordings.\nSchattschneider’s album, titled “Over the Moon”, features eight jazz renditions of moon-themed songs like “Fly Me to the Moon,” “Dancing in the Moonlight,” and “Moon River.” It will officially release on Friday. Schattschneider produced the album with her sister, Leah Schattschneider, a Nashville-based mixing engineer who specializes in vocal recording and editing. She said that it’s been incredible working with her sister.\nTo read the entire article, subscribe to the Wapakoneta Daily News today!",

    "text": "won't be very useful for another 20 years, causing stocks in this emerging sector to plunge\nmore than 40%for a total market value loss of over $8 billion. \"If you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that'd probably be on the early side. If you said 30, is probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it,\" Huang\nsaidduring a Q&A with analysts. PCMag reports: The field of quantum computing hasn't gotten nearly as much hype as generative AI and the tech giants promoting it in the past few years. Right now, part of the reason quantum computers aren't currently that helpful is because of their error rates. Nord Quantique CEO Julien Lemyre previously told PCMag that quantum error correction is the future of the field, and his firm is working on a solution. The errors that qubits, the basic unit of information in a quantum machine, currently make result in quantum computers being largely unhelpful. It's an essential hurdle to overcomeâ\"but we don't currently know if or when quantum errors will be eliminated.\nChris Erven, CEO and co-founder of Kets Quantum, believes quantum computers will eventually pose a significant threat to cybersecurity. \"China is making some of the largest investments in quantum computing, pumping in billions of dollars into research and development in the hope of being the first to create a large-scale, cryptographically relevant machine,\" Erven tells PCMag in a statement. \"Although they may be a few years away from being fully operational, we know a quantum computer will be capable of breaking all traditional cyber defenses we currently use. So they, and others, are actively harvesting now, to decrypt later.\" \"The 15 to 20-year timeline seems very realistic,\" said Ivana Delevska, investment chief of Spear Invest, which holds Rigetti and IonQ shares in an actively managed ETF. \"That is roughly what it took Nvidia to develop accelerated computing.\"",

    "text": "(Adnkronos) -\nFino a 100 euro a giornata: è il prezzo del dissenso per i lavoratori del trasporto pubblico locale. È la stima che hanno fatto per l’AdnKronos i sindacati del tpl, Uilt e Filt-Cgil, nel giorno dello sciopero generale che coinvolge anche il settore del trasporto, nonostante l’intervenuta precettazione del ministro al Mit, Matteo Salvini, che ha dimezzato la protesta da otto a quattro ore. Ed è proprio in replica alle parole del vicepremier, che accusa i sindacati di proclamare lo sciopero solo a ridosso del fine settimana, a smuovere la reazione delle sigle, le quali tornano a ricordare che chi protesta rinuncia ad una parte di stipendio.\nÈ vero che sul ‘costo’ della giornata, come ricordano gli stessi sindacati, incidono molti fattori, dall’anzianità ad eventuali accordi aziendali, ma il range si aggira comunque tra gli 80 e i 100/120 euro lordi a giornata, modulandosi anche sul numero di ore non lavorate. Si parte dai circa 100 euro lordi per le 24 ore di sciopero, arrivando ai 50 euro per le 8 ore. Nel 2024 il tpl – quantomeno a livello confederale – ha collezionato 5 scioperi, incluso quello odierno. Uno da 24 ore, uno da otto, e gli altri – precettati – da 4 ore.\nNumeri alla mano, in un anno di proteste i lavoratori perso mediamente fino a circa 200 euro lordi nella busta paga. E se la retribuzione a livello nazionale per un autista neoassunto è pari a circa 20mila euro lordi l’anno (1500 al mese), significa che in un anno il ‘taglio’ per chi ha scioperato è stato pari indicativamente all’1%.",
