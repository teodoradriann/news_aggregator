    "text": "**Sponsored by Plus Therapeutics . This content is not an endorsement from the ABTA.**  \nReSPECT-GBM Patient Story | Jim, Recurrent Glioblastoma Survivor Dr. Jim Stockand, a dedicated educator with a PhD in Physiology, has spent the past 24 years inspiring students in the classroom. However, in 2022, his life took an unexpected turn when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. After undergoing standard treatment, Jim faced a daunting setback when the glioblastoma recurred just nine months later. In January 2023, Jim took a courageous step by participating in the ReSPECT-GBM trial for recurrent glioblastoma . The day after he went home from his single-dose treatment, Jim and his wife were able to take a 7-mile walk together—a cherished activity that he had been unable to enjoy for nearly a year.\nJim’s story is a testament to resilience, hope, and the power of pioneering medical research. His journey not only highlights the challenges faced by those battling cancer but also the incredible moments of joy that can emerge in the midst of adversity. To learn more about his journey and the ReSPECT-GBM trial, visit respect-trials.com/gbm. ( NCT01906385 ).\nThe ReSPECT-GBM clinical trial is an American Brain Tumor Association Featured Clinical Study.\nReSPECT-LM Patient Story | Marlyn, Leptomeningeal Metastases Survivor At just 31 years old, while engaged in her Medical Residency in Pediatrics, Dr. Marlyn Cabrera faced a life-altering challenge: a diagnosis of breast cancer. For the next two decades, she navigated the complex landscape of treatment and recovery, showing incredible strength and determination. However, her journey took another difficult turn when the cancer metastasized to her cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and she was diagnosed with leptomeningeal metastases and given an estimated life expectancy of just 2 to 4 months.\nToday, more than six years after her initial diagnosis, Marlyn stands as a beacon of hope and resilience. After participating in the ReSPECT-LM Clinical Trial, she is eager to share her journey and the lessons learned along the way. Her firsthand experience emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive mindset and the transformative power of hope, bolstered by the unwavering support of her dedicated healthcare team and loved ones.

    "text": "Overnight storms leave thousands in Alabama without power A wave of storms that rumbled through Alabama late Thursday into Friday morning downed trees while leaving thousands without power. At 6:30 a.m. about 18,500 Alabama Power customers are without service in central Alabama, said Michael Jordan, spokesman for the utility. Statewide, there are 64,750 APC customers without power. Initial reports of damage include downed wire and multiple broken poles as a result of fallen trees and large limbs. Work is ongoing to evaluate damage and restore service as quickly and safely as possible, Jordan said. Power has been restored to more than 4,000 customers since midnight. Outages remain concentrated in the following areas: - Elmore County – 9,000 customers - Tallapoosa County – 3,400 customers - Butler County - 2,100 customers - Lee County - 1,100 customers - Lowndes County - 980 customers - Chilton County - 800 customers - Montgomery County – 715 customers - Autauga County - 320 customers Fewer, scattered outages also exist in Bullock County.

Do not drive over lines or under low-hanging lines. Always assume power lines are energized. - Keep children and pets away from downed lines. - Stay clear of areas with fallen trees or limbs where downed lines may be hidden. - Exercise caution near chain link fences. Dangerous lines may touch the metal. - Avoid stepping in puddles and standing water after a storm as they may be touching hidden, downed power lines and be electrified. - Do not attempt to remove tree limbs or anything else caught in power lines. Call us at 1-800-888-2726 or contact a local law enforcement agency if downed lines are spotted. Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Marty Roney at mroney@gannett.com.",

    "text": "> WASHINGTON, Feb 2 — The Biden administration yesterday imposed sanctions on four Israeli men it accused of being involved in settler violence in the West Bank, signalling growing US displeasure with the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order on Thursday that aims to punish ill-behaved Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians envisage a future state.\nThe order establishes a system for imposing financial sanctions and visa restrictions against individuals who attack or intimidate Palestinians or seize their property, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement.\n“Today’s actions seek to promote peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” he said.\nAdvertisement The State Department sanctions, freezing the US assets of the four men and generally barring Americans from dealing with them, are the latest since Palestinian Hamas militants on October 7 carried out an attack on Israel and Israel responded with an assault on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.\nIn December, the United States began imposing visa bans on people involved in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nA State Department statement yesterday said:\nAdvertisement • David Chai Chasdai initiated and led a riot that included setting vehicles and buildings on fire and causing damage to property in Huwara, resulting in the death of a Palestinian civilian.\n• Einan Tanjil assaulted Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists by attacking them with stones and clubs, resulting in injuries that required medical treatment.\n• Shalom Zicherman, according to video evidence, assaulted Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank, blocking them on the street, attempted to break the windows of passing vehicles with activists inside, and cornered at least two of the activists and injured both.\n• Yinon Levi led a group of settlers that assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, burned their fields and destroyed their property.\n“Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a separate statement.\n“The United States will continue to take actions to advance the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution, and is committed to the safety, security, and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.”\nBiden and other senior US officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.\nBiden has raised the issue directly with Netanyahu, said one senior official, as Biden seeks a path to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians once the Gaza conflict ends.\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said US officials had presented documented cases of settler violence to Israeli counterparts and in some cases Israel had taken action.\nThe levels of settler violence in the West Bank have come down in the past roughly two months since those interventions, Miller said at a press briefing.\nThree of the four men hit with sanctions had been prosecuted by Israel, he added.\nMiller said Thursday’s order was targeted at foreign nationals, but he did not rule out further US action against the many Jewish settlers who hold US citizenship.\n“You should not conclude that we are done,” he said.\nNetanyahu, who heads a religious-rightist coalition, has resisted US entreaties to develop a plan for post-conflict Gaza and to embrace a peace deal that envisages Israeli and Palestinian states side by side.\nHis office on Thursday responded to the US measures by saying they were unnecessary.\n“Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue,” it said in a statement.\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, head of the far-right pro-settlement party Religious Zionism, was defiant in a statement on the Biden order, saying:\n“The ‘settler violence’ campaign is an anti-semitic lie that enemies of Israel disseminate with the goal of smearing the pioneering settlers and settlement enterprise, and to harm them and thus smear the entire State of Israel,” Smotrich said.\nSince the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. It has built Jewish settlements there that most countries deem illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and biblical ties to the land. — Reuters",

    "text": "HUNTINGTON — Home was no kinder to the Coal Cats on Tuesday.\nTri-State fell to Bluefield 2-0 at Jack Cook Field for its fourth consecutive Appalachian League loss.\nThe previous three had come away from Huntington, and the Coal Cats are away again on a five-game road swing after Wednesday’s scheduled home bout with the division-leading Ridge Runners.\nFive Bluefield pitchers combined to fan 16 Tri-State hitters while allowing three hits in the shutout — Christian Charalambous (Presbyterian), Evan O’Neill (Indiana), Zach Applegate (Abilene Christian), Ethan Rucker (Georgetown) and Evan Mobley (Florida Southern).\nApplegate got the win with two hitless and scoreless innings. He struck out four.\nMobley accrued a save, pitching around two hits and a walk in two innings of work. He had three punchouts.\nNone of the quintet threw more than 35 pitches.\nJackson Golden (Marshall), Luke Kosko (no college listed) and Tyler Smolinski (Kansas State) each had a hit for the Coal Cats (12-20 entering Wednesday’s game). Golden’s was a double.\nTri-State got two runners on base with one out in the bottom of the ninth when Smolinski singled to move Kosko to second.\nBut Mobley struck out Julio Solier (Boston College) and pinch-hitter Chandler Murray (Kansas State), both looking, to end it.\nRyan Niedzwiedz (SIU Edwardsville) was 3 for 5, doubled twice and drove in a run for the Ridge Runners (21-13 entering Wednesday’s game). Cole Decker (Indiana) and Josh Hines (Florida Southern) each had two hits.\nKenneth Jackson (Southern) took the loss for the Coal Cats. He allowed two runs, both earned, on six hits over four frames. He issued three walks and had three strikeouts.",

    "text": "O governo da Venezuela anunciou nesta quinta-feira (28) que vai enviar tropas militares para a fronteira com a Guiana, onde fica o território de Essequibo . A região é rica em reservas de petróleo e virou alvo de investidas venezuelanas que resultam em uma disputa diplomática.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nReceba notícias de Santa Catarina pelo WhatsApp\nO anúncio foi feito pelo presidente Nicolás Maduro, transmitido pela TV venezuelana. As informações são do portal g1 . Segundo o site, o presidente informou que 5,6 mil homens estariam prontos para a operação.\nO gesto de Maduro é visto como uma resposta ao anúncio de que o Reino Unido vai enviar um navio militar para a costa da Guiana, que faz parte da comunidade de nações que foram colônias britânicas. O navio de patrulha da Marinha Real HMS Trent já estava no Caribe para atuar no combate ao tráfico de drogas, mas será desviada para a costa guianesa.\nO governo da Venezuela chegou a afirmar que essa atitude seria uma “provocação”.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nOs Estados Unidos também são aliados da Guiana e anunciaram sobrevoos militares na região, além de estudar a criação de uma base militar em Essequibo. O governo venezuelano também considerou a atitude norte-americana provocativa.\nEm novembro, a Venezuela realizou um referendo sobre a anexação de Essequibo, região maior que a Inglaterra e o estado do Ceará que corresponde à 70% do território da Guiana, mas que a Venezuela alega ser sua historicamente.\nApenas metade dos eleitores compareceu ao referendo, mas o presidente aprovou a anexação, e, na sequência, apresentou novos mapas oficiais já com a região contemplada como de seu país.\nEntenda onde fica a região em disputa Essequibo corresponde a cerca de 70% do território da Guiana (Foto: Divulgação, Agência Brasil) Região de tensão entre Venezuela e Guiana (Foto: Divulgação, Agência Brasil) Local é disputado há décadas pelos dois países (Foto: Vítor Abdala, Agência Brasil) O local tem a área maior que a Inglaterra e o estado do Ceará, e concentra reservas de petróleo (Foto: Divulgação, Agência Brasil) Mohamed Irfaan Ali (Guiana) e Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela) (Foto: IICA, EBC/Divulgação) Voltar Avançar\nContinua depois da publicidade\nLeia também O que é Essequibo, área da Guiana cobiçada pela Venezuela\nHá risco de guerra?

    "text": "Jeux\nSi tu espères jouer à GTA6 à 60fps dès le premier jour, nous avons de terribles nouvelles pour toi\nBien que les 30fps soient complètement stables et que les 60fps finissent par arriver avec le temps ne sont pas exclus\n- 30 janvier 2025\n- Mise à jour: 30 janvier 2025 à 12:28\nLa communauté des joueurs a qualifié Grand Theft Auto VI de jeu vidéo le plus attendu de tous les temps, en partie en raison de l’attente prolongée depuis son annonce. Au fil du temps, les fans se sont tournés vers des rumeurs, des fuites et des déclarations d’anciens développeurs de Rockstar pour obtenir des informations sur le titre tant attendu.\nLes tant désirés 60fps, impossibles au lancement\nSelon Mike York, un ancien développeur ayant travaillé sur des titres comme GTA 5 et Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA 6 devrait être lancé sur les consoles de génération actuelle, telles que la PS5 et la Xbox Series X|S, avec un objectif de performance de 30 FPS. Dans une récente interview, York a souligné que le studio pourrait privilégier la stabilité et la qualité visuelle par rapport au taux de rafraîchissement dans la version initiale du jeu. « Je ne pense pas qu’ils soient capables d’atteindre les 60 FPS dès le début sur une console de base comme la PS5 », a déclaré York.\nLes experts en technologie de jeux vidéo, tels que les analystes de Digital Foundry, s’accordent à dire qu’il ne sera pas viable de maintenir 60 FPS stables sur la version initiale des consoles. On anticipe que seuls les joueurs sur PC pourront expérimenter le jeu à 60 FPS, une fois que des optimisations seront mises en œuvre et que de nouvelles cartes graphiques seront lancées à l’avenir.\nL’ancien développeur a également mentionné que, bien que la version initiale pourrait fonctionner à 30 FPS verrouillés, il est possible que les performances s’améliorent avec le temps. « Une fois que le jeu sera disponible sur PC, il sera probablement optimisé et pourra s’exécuter à 60 FPS », a ajouté York. Cette perspective suggère que Rockstar se concentrera sur la fourniture d’une expérience de haute qualité avant d’essayer d’augmenter le taux de rafraîchissement dans de futures mises à jour.\nPour l’instant, les fans de GTA 6 doivent attendre un peu plus pour découvrir ce qui promet d’être un autre opus monumental de Rockstar Games. Même pour savoir s’ils ne devront pas payer 100 euros.",
