    "text": "A Jewish New Yorker who survived the Hamas attack at the Nova Music Festival has reunited with the man who saved her life. Natalie Sanandaji, 28, returned to Israel for the first time since the harrowing October 7 massacre and met Israeli hero Moshe Sati, who, alongside his son, rescued more than 100 festival-goers, including herself, by driving into the terrorist attack multiple times, transporting them to safety. In the touching reunion filmed by CNN, the two embrace each other while Sati can be seen tearing up. Sanandaji, who only recently learned Sati’s name, expressed deep gratitude, describing him as one of the kindest souls she has ever met. Despite Sati’s modesty and reluctance for recognition, Sanandaji considers herself fortunate for his selfless actions, emphasizing that he is known in his hometown for always helping others without hesitation. Natalie Sanandaji, 28, returned to Israel for the first time since the harrowing October 7 massacre and met hero Moshe Sati, who saved her life Israeli hero Moshe Sati, who, alongside his son, rescued more than 100 festival-goers by driving into the terrorist attack multiple times, transporting them to safety In the touching reunion filmed by CNN , the two embrace each other while Sati can be seen tearing up Sati’s son, an observant Jew who celebrates the Sabbath – meaning, he cannot drive or work on Saturday, joined his father in the rescue mission despite these limitations. Sanandaji recounted the emotional reunion, capturing the genuine bond formed between them due to the shared trauma. She said Sati’s acts of heroism went beyond expectations. Despite the terrifying ordeal at the festival, Sanandaji conveyed feeling safer in Israel than in the United States. She voiced concerns over the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the US, particularly in her hometown of New York, citing various acts of hate targeting the Jewish community. Sanandaji ran for her life while getting gunned down by terrorists on October 7, ultimately surviving the horrific massacre. Although she made it out alive and returned to her home in Long Island a week later, she said she does not feel any safer back in the US. On October 7, she and three friends were camping overnight at the Supernova Sukkot Gathering near Re’im, an event billed as a night of ‘friends, love and infinite freedom’ to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot with electronic music. On the first evening, nothing was out of the ordinary. But moments before dawn broke on Saturday, explosions appeared in the sky. ‘We were woken up by one of our friends who came to tell us some rockets had been sent over.’ For many of her friends, this is normal. ‘But this is not something that I am used to seeing.’ In October, Sanandaji told DailyMail.com many were still in the crowd dancing when the first salvoes of rockets passed overhead. For a time, it was not clear what was happening. Some festival-goers were seen walking away from the disruption. Others carried on, unaware. Despite the terrifying ordeal at the festival, Sanandaji conveyed feeling safer in Israel than in the United States ‘Many people who were in the crowd had told me that they thought the noises were coming from the music,’ Natalie said. ‘After a few minutes, we started to realize that the rockets just kept coming and kept coming and kept coming. Though first time I really realized how severe the situation was becoming was when they shut off the music.’ Security guards reacted quickly, at first telling guests to get down and cover their faces. As the missiles closed in, they told guests to pack what they could and evacuate as soon as possible. ‘They were there until the end,’ Natalie explained. ‘Most of them had died, guiding us and trying to get us to safety.’ ‘Everybody started driving in one direction. There was traffic from so many cars being in such a confined space all trying to leave at the same time. ‘Even at that point, in my head I was thinking, “OK, if it’s just rockets, if they’re not in our vicinity, we have the Iron Dome. Some scrap from intercepted rockets could hit our cars. But we’ll be in our cars. We’ll be okay. We’ll get out of here. It might take a few hours because there’s so many people, but we’ll be fine.” ‘When we started driving in one direction, security started telling people to drive in another direction. That’s when we realized that there must be something else going on other than just the rockets. ‘Security started yelling at everybody “get out of your cars,” “park your cars on the side of the dirt road and run!” ‘I didn’t understand why at first… and then we heard the first gunshots.’ Within moments, gunmen had entered the festival on motorbikes, in vans and by motorized paraglider and started shooting at the event’s 3,500 attendees with Kalashnikov assault rifles. At least 260 people died in the massacre, with many victims shot in the back as they tried to run. Countless were injured, and many more taken back into Gaza as hostages. Natalie only knew that she had to keep moving. ‘The security told us to pull over to the side of the road: “Being in the cars is making you too easy of a target – get out of your car and start running.” Natalie Sanandaji escaped the massacre with a group of friends on Saturday, October 7, 2023 “These are the only photos I have from the festival. Obviously didn’t have much time to take any other photos or videos since we were running for our lives.” – Natalie Sanandaji, 28 Destroyed cars and personal items are still left scattered around the festival site, on October 13 ‘As soon as we heard the first gunshots… I was there with three people, we were in the car together. We opened the doors and we started running for our lives. ‘After that we just ran. I remember at a certain point there was a bit of a ditch. And we were contemplating if we should go into the ditch and hide, or if we should keep running. And we kept running. A lot of people that went into the ditch are not here today. Every decision we made ended up saving our lives. But we had… no one had any idea what decision to make. You just had to make a decision in that moment.’ ‘We ran for about four hours, on and off. In between the gunshots, anytime the gunshots would subdue for a little bit, we would say, “Okay, we’re going to, we’re going to walk a little slower, we’re going to catch our breath.” ‘The scariest thing for me was running in a certain direction – thinking that you’re running to safety – and then suddenly seeing dozens of other kids running in your direction and realizing that they’re running from a terrorist, that they are running from shooting. ‘These were innocent children. We had nothing to protect ourselves. Imagine you’re in an open field with nowhere to hide and they are coming at you from every direction. ‘Kids were running in all different directions and you had to make a split-second decision on where to run, to where you thought it would be safe. ‘And that decision would either save your life or get you killed or kidnapped.’ The group of four continued to follow the road out of Re’im. Their last instruction from camp security had been to push on to the nearest town. For miles, they walked along the banks of short grassland and fields with little in the way of protection. An Israeli officer walks around a campsite at the festival near Re’im kibbutz on October 17 ‘The scariest thing for me was running in a certain direction – thinking that you’re running to safety – and then suddenly seeing dozens of other kids running in your direction and realizing that they’re running from a terrorist, that they are running from shooting.’ Destroyed cars are seen at the party site near the Kibbutz Re’im on Tuesday, October 10, 2023 ‘The only time we had someone near us to guide us was about two hours in. We saw a police officer and his direction was to go in the direction of the sun. That was the direction the town was in.’ The police officer walked with Natalie and her group for a while, armed only with a handgun. He explained he could not call for backup because Hamas had taken over the nearby police station. Over the radio, ‘you could hear the terrorists yelling’. They could only keep moving. ‘There was just an exodus of hundreds and hundreds of kids walking in the same direction. And then every time we heard gunshots, some people ran this way, some people ran that way. ‘You’re in an open field and there’s almost nowhere to hide. It felt hopeless. It really felt hopeless. There’s just simply nowhere to hide, there was nowhere to go. There’s stories of some people that hid in drains, in trees and fields. A lot of those people… they ended up finding them and killing most of them. ‘The ones that survived were the ones that hid under the dead bodies and pretended to be dead.’ Exhausted, Natalie’s group eventually stopped to rest in the shade of a tree. Four hours had passed and they were still miles from the nearest town, an endless journey with no way to know how far they had gone. As they paused, they saw a large white van coming towards them. ‘At first we thought it might be a terrorist so we fought to get up and run… but then we realised, “where would we run to? What would we do?”‘ The group could only wait by the side of the road. The vehicle pulled up and a man got out. He offered them a lift. They still had an hour to go. Vehicles were abandoned after security guards told attendees to leave their cars and run Fleeing for their lives, people had no time to react when told the abandon their cars and run. Pictured: car keys are left in the ignition of a destroyed car at the festival on October 12 Charred and damaged cars along a desert road after an attack by Hamas militants at the Tribe of Nova Trance music festival near Kibbutz Re’im in southern Israel on Saturday, October 7 ‘The people that risked their own lives to try to save us was incredible to see. I couldn’t believe that these people were going out of their way to risk their lives to save all of us. If that man didn’t come with his car, I don’t think I would be here today. ‘It’s very hard for me to comprehend these stories that I am seeing now, every day, someone else that was kidnapped, that their friends and family had a little bit of hope that maybe they are still alive. Every day people are posting that they have been found dead.’ Natalie and her friends were fortunate to escape to Patish, a nearby moshav. There, she says the town came together to help those still flooding in. ‘They gave us food. They gave us shelter. We hid in their bomb shelters.’ She described the horror parents were undergoing all the while as they acted quickly to take in more children. ‘When the rockets started going off, all the children there were messaging their parents, telling them what was happening. To tell them that they were safe and trying to escape. ‘Many people, after a while, couldn’t get in touch with their kids anymore. Either their kids were kidnapped or killed. So a lot of people in the town were receiving lists of names of people that were at the festival that… weren’t answering their family and friends anymore. ‘And they were walking around reading off lists of names hoping that maybe somebody was saved and maybe somebody was in the shelter and then they could inform their families that they are okay.’ Natalie managed to get in touch with her mother, who lives in New York. ‘I honestly did not tell my mom where I was until after I got home safe because I couldn’t stand the idea of her worrying about me about my life that way.’ Soon after, Natalie made plans to return home, coming home via Athens. There, she contacted the press, feeling she needed to share her story. She said there is now nowhere she feels entirely safe, amid heightened reports of antisemitism globally. Anti-Jewish threats on Telegram surged 488 percent in the first 18 hours after Hamas’ incursion, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The first four days of the conflict also saw anti-Semitic incidents in the United Kingdom surge by more than 300 percent, according to Community Security Trust. ‘I have a lot of friends in New York right now who are afraid to leave their homes,’ Natalie said. ‘I had a friend who tried to call an Uber and the Uber driver messaged her and asked her, “Are you Jewish?” And then said, “If you are, I will kill you.” ‘It doesn’t feel safe to be anywhere right now. The fact that I’m not in Israel doesn’t make me feel safe. ‘I’m incredibly scared for what’s to come. Because everything that has happened so far is not the end it is only going to get worse and that’s what scares me the most.’ In spite of all she has gone through, Natalie’s message to the world is to avoid the conflict descending into further unnecessary factional violence. She says she wants people to ‘understand that we have the same common enemy’ in Hamas, as distinct from the Palestinian people. ‘[Hamas] is a terrorist organization that does not care though about the lives of Palestinian people, or any people,’ she said. ‘We have to come together against this common enemy.’ ‘I am seeing a lot of support online from a lot of countries, from a lot of governments, from a lot of people I know personally, from people I don’t know personally. But I think there is still a lot of confusion as to who Hamas is, what they are doing. ‘Especially as an Iranian Jew, just a year ago the Iranian government was killing innocent children in their own streets. And I feel that a lot of Iranians even don’t realize that we are fighting against the same people. We need to come together and realize that we have the same common enemy.’ ‘I also want people to understand the fear that Jews are feeling all over the world, whether it’s in London or Paris, or New York, or Israel. ‘The things that I’m seeing that are happening in New York – I don’t actually feel safe going home,’ she said. ‘Everyone keeps telling me “it’s so great that you’re almost back in New York, you’re almost home”. But I don’t feel safe going back to New York. ‘And that’s the scariest part. That’s the saddest part – that I don’t feel safe.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12910307/Jewish-New-Yorker-survived-Hamas-attack-Nova-Music-Festival-hugs-rescuer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "title": "L.A. Lakers mystique was alive and well in '23 on DraftKings' sportsbook in Ontario.",
    "text": "TORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors. The Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action. \"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors. \"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\" The Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets. The Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series. Toronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth. Toronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers. Avello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list. \"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\" The Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots. No Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks. Toronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops. Last month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year. \"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\" Surprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC. Buffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot. \"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada. \"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\" Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth. Ontario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion. Toronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. \"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\" The Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth). Rick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference. Peter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates. \"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play. \"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.

    "text": "Mais de mil crianças não receberam o nome do pai no registro de nascimento em Porto Alegre Número cresce mesmo diante da queda de nascimentos no país, conforme dados da Central de Informações do Registro Civil publicidade Mais de 1,1 mil recém-nascidos de 2023 não tiveram a paternidade registrada, conforme dados da Central de Informações do Registro Civil (CRC). Ter o nome do pai na certidão de nascimento considerada a garantia de uma série de direitos para as crianças brasileiras. Além do benefício afetivo que a paternidade possibilita, ela permite o acesso a uma série de prerrogativas, como pensão alimentícia, herança, inclusão em planos de saúde e de previdência, entre outros. Os dados revelam que a realidade tem sido negada para um número cada vez maior de porto-alegrenses e que, em 2023, totalizou 1.177 mil recém-nascidos sem a paternidade registrada, um aumento de 22,9% em relação a 2022, quando foram 958 o número de registros sem o nome do pai. Mesmo com esforços de entes públicos e privados, assim como mudanças na legislação que possibilitam o reconhecimento de paternidade direto em Cartório – sem a necessidade de procedimento judicial -, além da paternidade socioafetiva, o número de crianças sem o nome do pai no registro de nascimento tem crescido ano após ano, mesmo com a diminuição constante do número de nascimentos. Dados da CRC mostram que entre 2016 e 2023, o número de nascimentos aumentou 9,5% em Porto Alegre, enquanto a quantidade de crianças sem o nome do pai no registro cresceu 69,1%. O presidente da Associação Nacional dos Registradores de Pessoas Naturais do Rio Grande do Sul (Arpen/RS), Sidnei Hofer Birmann, afirma que os Cartórios do Estado vêm cumprindo com o seu papel de orientar sobre a importância do nome do pai no registro de nascimento e a facilidade do procedimento, que pode ser realizado sem a necessidade de ação judicial, diretamente em Cartório. Porém. “Mesmo assim não tem sido suficiente para estancar este problema grave da sociedade gaúcha”, explica. Uma nova proposta para tentar enfrentar o problema surgiu durante os debates do novo Código Civil neste ano. O anteprojeto elaborado por uma Comissão de Juristas e entregue para análise do Congresso Nacional, prevê o registro imediato da paternidade a partir da declaração da mãe quando o pai se recusar a realizar o exame de DNA. Paternidade Biológica Além dos meios judiciais, envolvendo exames de DNA, o procedimento de reconhecimento de paternidade também pode ser feito diretamente em qualquer Cartório de Registro Civil, não sendo necessária decisão judicial nos casos em que todas as partes concordam com a resolução. Nos casos em que iniciativa seja do próprio pai, basta que ele compareça ao Cartório com a cópia da certidão de nascimento do filho, sendo necessária a concordância da mãe ou do próprio filho, caso este seja maior de idade. Em caso de filho menor, é necessário a anuência da mãe. Caso o pai não queira reconhecer o filho, a mãe pode fazer a indicação do suposto pai no próprio Cartório, que comunicará aos órgãos competentes para que seja iniciado o processo de investigação de paternidade. Paternidade Socioafetiva Desde 2017 também é possível realizar em Cartório de Registro Civil o reconhecimento de paternidade socioafetiva, aquele onde os pais criam uma criança mediante uma relação de afeto, sem nenhum vínculo biológico, desde que haja a concordância da mãe e do pai biológico. Nestes casos, o procedimento pode ser feitos direto em Cartório quando a criança é maior de 12 anos. Caberá ao registrador civil, mediante a apresentação de documentos e entrevistas com os envolvidos, atestar a existência do vínculo afetivo da paternidade ou maternidade.",
