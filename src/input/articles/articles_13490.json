    "title": "Happy Flooding New Year: Britain on deluge alert as 75mph gales, wind and SNOW threaten to lash the country as millions prepare to see in 2024 | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Millions of Britons are set for a New Year's Eve washout as parts of the UK brace for 75mph gales, flooding and snow over the long weekend. With seven named storms over the last three months bringing travel chaos, blizzards and even a tornado, revellers seeing in 2024 have been warned to wrap up warm and hold onto their party hats amid near-freezing conditions. This week, Storm Gerrit has wreaked havoc across the UK - and forecasters have warned that a low pressure system is set to bring more wet and windy weather. In England, the Environment Agency has issued 31 flood warnings, where flooding is expected, and 97 flood alerts, where flooding is possible. Meanwhile in Scotland, which has been heavily impacted by Storm Gerrit, there are five flood alerts and six flood warnings. In Wales, there are 11 flood alerts. Drone footage has shown that parts of the UK have already faced major flooding, including at a racecourse in Worcester after the River Severn burst its banks. Millions of Britons are set for a for a New Year's Eve washout as parts of the UK brace for 75mph gales, flooding and even snow. Pictured: Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire In England, there are currently 31 flood warnings, where flooding is expected, and 97 flood alerts, where flooding is possible The Met Office has issued a yellow wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. A warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight Huge parts of flood prone town of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire have also been submerged by water as Britain continues to battle with unsettled weather. More flooding is expected in England over the next five days, especially in the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber until Tuesday. Flooding is also possible across parts of the south west tomorrow and across the Midlands and the north tomorrow and Sunday. It comes as the Met Office issued a wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. An active cold front will move east across England and Wales tomorrow and into Sunday which will widely bring gusts of 45 to 50mph, but some reaching 60mph and the strongest near coasts in the west and south with 65 to 75mph in places. Meteorologists expect flooding, power cuts and disruption to roads, trains, planes and ferries as well as delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges. Up to 50mm (2in) of rain could fall in North West Wales with 25mm (1in) quite widely elsewhere in the country, while Northern Ireland was told to brace for up to 25mm (1in) in a few hours with warnings that the downpours will fall on saturated ground. Separately, a warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight, with up to 10cm (4in) of the white stuff across higher ground and 3cm (1.2in) even on lower ground as well as 25mm (1in) of rain. The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm - Storm Henk - after Storm Gerrit sparked days of travel chaos following Christmas. Rail operators told revellers to travel to parties today amid concerns over further disruption and staff shortages when severe weather strikes in the next two days - with one operator issuing a 'do not travel' alert for some routes on New Year's Eve. Low pressure will bring more wet and windy weather to the UK and warnings for heavy rain, strong winds and snow have been issued for this weekend The Met Office released a video of the low pressure coming in across the weekend, with the above forecast for New Year's Eve Storm Gerrit hammering the seafront at Porthcawl on the South Wales coast this morning Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire today after heavy rain from the storm A Knottingley Canoe Club member makes their way down the River Ouse in flooded York today Northern, which runs 2,500 services through 500 stations daily, said customers with tickets for New Year's Eve could use them today or tomorrow to avoid disruption. The UK's second largest train operator issued a 'do not travel' warning for six routes with no service on New Year's Eve - including Morecambe or Heysham to Lancaster; Preston to Colne; Manchester Victoria to Chester; Manchester Piccadilly to Chester via Altrincham; Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge; and Clitheroe to Bolton. Travel continued to be affected by the storm today, with rail disruption in Wales and Scotland - while LNER cancelled some trains this morning due to staff shortages and other services faced speed restrictions due to a signalling fault north of Newcastle. CrossCountry was operating a reduced service due to a 'shortage of train crew'. Avanti West Coast passengers also faced further cancellations today after all London Euston trains were axed yesterday afternoon amid four separate incidents including a person being hit by a train, a points failure, a tree falling on the line and flooding. Other disruption today included on London Underground's Central and Circle lines due to train shortages and cancellations; Merseyrail due to a signalling fault; and on East Midlands Railway due to a broken down train at Grimsby. Southeastern was also delayed between Ebbsfleet and St Pancras due to a signalling issue. Earlier in the week, Greater Manchester Police declared a major incident after a supercell thunderstorm hit the Tameside town of Stalybridge. A tornado damaged 100 homes, sent trees toppling 'like dominoes' and wrote off cars as flying debris caused major structural damage while residents hid under their duvets. Elsewhere, three men died after their 4x4 vehicle was submerged in a river, near Glaisdale in North Yorkshire. The UK is set for a deluge as soon as tomorrow, with the Met Office issuing a yellow weather warning for rain and snow for much of Scotland. The warning is in place from 8am until midnight on Saturday with up to 25mm of rain forecast at lower levels. A period of sleet and snow, turning to rain, may lead to some flooding and travel disruption. Bus and train services may be affected, with journey times taking longer, with some spray and flooding on roads. Some interruption to power services is also likely. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up continues, but electricity bosses are 'very confident' the remaining properties will be reconnected on Friday. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution said that as of 4pm on Friday, electricity supplies had been successfully restored to more than 47,000 properties, with 250 still off supply. Andy Smith, operations director at SSEN Distribution, said on Friday: 'Our teams have continued to make excellent progress today in restoring customers impacted by Storm Gerrit, in the face of continued challenging conditions. People under umbrellas as they go for a punt on the River Cam in the Cambridge rain today Water is pumped out of a house in York this morning after the River Ouse burst its banks Tewkesbury Cricket Club's pavilion is surrounded by floodwater today following heavy rain 'We recognise this has been a difficult couple of days for the customers still affected and I'm grateful to them for their continued patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power. 'Up to now we've targeted our restoration plan on repairing the faults that will reconnect the greatest number of customers and those who have been without power the longest. 'Today, we face a number of complex and very localised faults, and whilst we're still encountering some access challenges, we're pressing on to reconnect those final customers affected. 'I'd therefore like to reassure our customers that all our teams have been directed to these last few remaining areas of damage for this final push. 'Our established welfare policy is active, offering reimbursement for meals and accommodation, for those who're eligible, and we're speaking to our most vulnerable customers to offer them tailored support. 'Anyone who may need additional help or advice should contact our dedicated teams on the power cut helpline, 105.' Chaotic scenes at London Euston once again yesterday as passengers wait for travel updates Rail passengers queue to get inside Glasgow Central yesterday for a London-bound train Passengers wait at a barrier at London Paddington yesterday while all services are suspended Damaged houses in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, yesterday after Wednesday's tornado Flooded fields on the Somerset Levels yesterday after Storm Gerrit brought severe weather Residents in the Kinloss Park area of Cupar in Scotland clean up yesterday after flooding Travellers could face disruption across the rail network on Saturday, with operators urging passengers to check their journeys before setting off. Andy Page, Met Office chief forecaster, said: 'Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm (1-2in), while up to 25mm (just under 1in) of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. 'Across Wales and southern England, wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.'",

    "text": "NDA allies call for review of Agnipath, JD(U) distances itself NEW DELHI: NDA partners JD(U), led by Nitish Kumar, and Chirag Paswan’s LJP on Thursday articulated concern over the Agnipath scheme which was used by the opposition to attack govt over inadequate generation of jobs, though the former backpedalled on its comments saying they were twisted out of context. JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi was the first off the blocks, telling TV news channels that his party, which with 12 MPs may have an outsized role in the BJP-led coalition govt, will insist on a review of the Agnipath scheme under which 75% of recruits, the Agniveers, will be let go of after four years while the rest get to serve for another 15 years. LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, in response to a question, told NDTV that govt must revisit the Agnipath scheme to ascertain whether it had delivered the desired results. “If somebody has raised it, the NDA gives us that platform to sit and discuss. Yesterday (Wednesday), in the (NDA) meeting, my PM said on record that he is open to discussion. This platform is open and he is easily available for discussion of concerns and suggestions. If somebody feels or any party feels, I definitely believe that we must revisit that (Agnipath),” he said. Paswan said the govt must carry out an assessment of how much could be delivered through this scheme as it directly concerned youngsters. “If it is beneficial and working for them as per the intention of the scheme and it is getting penetrated well, then we must continue. If not, then we should come up with suggestions of what can be done. But these things can be kept on hold for a while or till govt formation. So, immediately after that, we can sit and discuss all these things,” he said. The comments were interpreted as muscle-flexing by allies whose strength has acquired disproportionate dimension because of BJP lacking its own majority, before Tyagi dialled back by saying that his comments to TV channels were edited out of context. “What is said was in exact sync with the line articulated on several occasions by Rajnath Singh that the scheme is going to be reviewed periodically to look for shortcomings and their removal,” Tyagi said, adding that there were reports of unhappiness among a section of voters in western UP and Rajasthan. “My assertion that JD(U) is part of NDA and has extended unconditional support to the Modi govt was also left out,” he further said. On JD(U)’s support to a Modi-led govt, Tyagi said, “There is no pre-condition, there is unconditional support. But it is in our mind and heart that Bihar should be given special status. After bifurcation, the situation Bihar has faced, it cannot be corrected without granting special status.” On caste census, which was carried out by the Nitish Kumar govt in Bihar with the support of BJP, RJD and all other political parties, Tyagi said, “No party in the country has opposed caste census. Bihar has shown the way, the prime minister also did not oppose... It is the demand of the time, and we will pursue it.” Paswan also backed a caste-wise headcount. “Me and my party do support caste census. There’s a reason behind this because even after seven decades of Independence, there are still schemes and policies which are drafted for the upliftment of a particular caste or section of society. Many times, courts have also asked for the population count of a particular caste. So, I do believe that govt should have these details with it, what is the figure of a particular caste. I’m not in favour of making it public, because that increases the divide,” he said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had made caste census one of his main campaign themes. Tyagi said JD(U) was not opposed to Uniform Civil Code but all stakeholders should be consulted. “On UCC, the chief minister (Nitish Kumar) had written to the Law Commission. We are not against UCC. But there should be consultation with all stakeholders, chief ministers, political parties and different sects, and a resolution should be found,” he said. For more news like this visit TOI.

SO IF YOU’RE DOING THE QUEEN BEE, IT SHOULD FEEL GREAT. IF YOU’RE RUNNING IT NOW. OF COURSE, IF YOU’RE ON THE SIDELINES CHEERING SOMEONE ON A LITTLE BIT CHILLY FOR YOU. SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN EXTRA SWEATSHIRT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR THE MORNING. BUT AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY, WE’LL SEE A COUPLE CLOUDS PASSING BY OCCASIONALLY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES CLIMBING UP TO 80 DEGREES. NOW, AS WE GET INTO NEXT WEEK, HERE’S WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN. A DRY FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON SUNDAY. THERE IS A CHANCE OF A PASSING SHOWER ON SUNDAY, BUT I DO, FOR THE MOST PART THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE DRY. SO WITH THAT FRONT MOVING THROUGH ON SUNDAY INTO MONDAY, EVEN THOUGH IT’S NOT BRINGING US ANYTHING IN TERMS OF RAINFALL, IT IS GOING TO BRING US SOME SERIOUSLY COOL WEATHER AS WE HEAD INTO NEXT WEEK. EVEN COLD AT TIMES. SO HIGH TEMPERATURES. THAT’S THE NUMBER THAT YOU SEE HERE 58 ON MONDAY, 57, TUESDAY, 59 ON WEDNESDAY. BUT WE WILL FALL DOWN INTO THE 30S IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. SO THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE DROPPING DOWN TO ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT 35 TO 37 DEGREES FOR A COUPLE OF THESE MORNINGS. SO FROST IS A POSSIBILITY. THEN ON TOP OF THAT, OF COURSE, IT’S JUST GOING TO BE COLD. YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO WAKE UP A LITTLE BIT EARLY. MAKE SURE THE WINDSHIELD DOESN’T NEED DEFROSTING IN THE MORNINGS. I THINK, ESPECIALLY ON WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY MORNING, THAT’S WHEN I THINK IT’S GOING TO BE THE COLDEST THURSDAY MORNING FOR SURE. BUT NOTICE WE DO START TO WARM UP MORE SO AS WE GET INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S 64 THURSDAY 68 ON FRIDAY.

    "text": "MADRID, 8 Ago. (EUROPA PRESS) - El Gobierno de Brasil ha expulsado este jueves a la embajadora de Nicaragua en Brasilia, Fulvia Patricia Castro Matu, después de que las autoridades nicaraguenses ordenaran al embajador brasileño, Breno de Souza da Costa, abandonar el país, confirmando así un notable deterioro en las relaciones bilaterales entre ambas naciones latinoamericanas. El régimen de Daniel Ortega había anunciado previamente la expulsión de De Souza da Costa después de que el jefe de la misión diplomática no acudiese al acto del 45 aniversario de la Revolución Sandinista del 19 de julio, según informaciones recogidas por el portal de noticias nicaragüense Divergentes. Tras conocerse la noticia, el presidente de Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, ha convocado por la mañana (hora local) al ministro de Exteriores, Mauro Vieira, para abordar la situación. Amparándose en el principio de reprocidad, Brasilia ha decidido finalmente expulsar a Castro Matu, recoge el 'O Globo'. La vicepresidenta nicaragüense, Rosario Murillo, ha confirmado en una breve declaración estas expulsiones cruzadas y ha señalado que la embajadora en Brasil asumirá a su regreso un nuevo cargo, el de ministra de Economía Familiar. El distanciamiento entre Lula y Ortega, quienes llegaron a ser aliados, comenzó a raíz del interés de Brasilia por interceder en la liberación del obispo Rolando Álvarez, que fue condenado a 26 años de cárcel y despojado de su nacionalidad por \\\"traidor a la patria\\\", para posteriormente ser desterrado al Vaticano. De hecho, el mandatario brasileño reveló hace poco que Ortega ni siquiera respondía a sus llamadas para tratar el asunto de los religiosos encarcelados.",

    "text": "Economia Alimentos seguem com oferta prejudicada por condições climáticas adversas, avalia IBGE Rio 10/05/2024 14h32 Na passagem de março para abril, o consumidor se deparou com menos alimentos com aumentos de preços, porém, os reajustes foram mais agudos, apontou André Almeida, gerente do Sistema Nacional de Índices de Preços do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE).\nO grupo Alimentação e bebidas saiu de um aumento de 0,53% em março para uma elevação de 0,70% em abril, dentro do Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo (IPCA). O grupo contribuiu com 0,15 ponto porcentual para a taxa de 0,38% do IPCA do último mês.\nO índice de difusão de itens alimentícios, que mostra o porcentual de produtos com aumentos de preços, passou de 61% em março para 53% em abril.\n\"A gente teve menos subitens alimentícios com variação positiva, ou seja, essa queda no índice de difusão. Porém, teve variação maior em subitens alimentícios. Teve variação de dois dígitos no tomate e cebola\", apontou Almeida. \"Teve variações mais altas em alimentos que têm peso relevante no consumo das famílias, isso acaba contribuindo para essa aceleração.\"\nSegundo o pesquisador, os preços dos alimentos têm subido nos últimos meses por uma influência climática sazonal, agravada nesta temporada pela ocorrência do fenômeno El Niño. A ocorrência de chuvas intensas e ondas de calor ainda prejudica algumas lavouras, reduzindo a oferta de determinados itens.\n\"Cada alimento vai ter uma explicação individualizada. Porém, de maneira geral, o que a gente observou no final do ano passado e início deste ano continua se aplicando\", disse Almeida, referindo aos problemas climáticos sazonais, agravados neste ano. \"Isso acaba prejudicando alimentos mais sensíveis ao clima.\"\nO custo da alimentação no domicílio subiu 0,81% em abril. As famílias pagaram mais pelo mamão (22,76%), cebola (15,63%), tomate (14,09%) e café moído (3,08%). Já os preços das carnes recuaram 0,97% em abril. \"Tem maior oferta de animais para abate, os preços das carnes têm caído nos últimos meses\", justificou Almeida.\nJá a alimentação fora do domicílio aumentou 0,39% em abril. O lanche subiu 0,44% e a refeição fora de casa, 0,34%.\nJuca Kfouri\nA boa convocação da seleção com o ataque REV\nJosé Paulo Kupfer\nChoque de oferta no Sul vai reduzir deflação\nJamil Chade\nVenezuelanos e haitianos agora vivem drama no RS\nMilly Lacombe\nA comovente união entre Grêmio e Inter no RS\nComunicar erro Veja também Deixe seu comentário Só para assinantes",
