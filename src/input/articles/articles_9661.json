    "text": "What to Know about the Stunning Northern Lights for Friday Night: Details The breathtaking aurora borealis may be visible this Friday night across several US states. This is thanks to a recent space phenomenon. A geomagnetic storm pushed the northern lights further south than usual this week. As a result, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (NWSSWPC) calculates another chance to see them at the right location on October 11, 2024, after many witnessed the event the previous day. The NWSSWPC has been tracking the aurora's activity and predicts a KP index of five for Friday night. This index, ranging from 0 to 9, indicates the intensity of the aurora. A KP of 5 suggests a brighter and more active aurora, potentially visible further south than usual. The aurora typically appears as a [green oval](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) centered on Earth's magnetic pole, but it can turn red during periods of heightened activity. While often seen just after sunset or before sunrise, the aurora is [not visible](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast) in daylight. Interestingly, it doesn't have to be directly overhead to be seen; under ideal conditions, it can be observed from as far as 1,000 km (approximately 621 miles) away. This celestial display isn't just a visual wonder; it also serves as an indicator of geomagnetic storm conditions. These events can impact various technologies, including radio communication and GPS navigation. The NWSSWPC emphasizes the aurora borealis as [an exceptional opportunity](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast) for many to personally experience the wonders of space weather. It is a captivating nighttime display that entices people to journey to Arctic regions simply to witness its beauty. To see this event, the NWSSWPC [suggests](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/tips-viewing-aurora) finding a location with minimal light pollution and an unobstructed view to the north. A higher vantage point, like a hill, can further enhance your viewing experience. Additionally, the optimal time to watch is usually within an hour or two of midnight, between 10 PM and 2 AM local time. So, which states are most likely to catch this dazzling display? According to[ the view line](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-viewline-tonight-and-tomorrow-night-experimental) calculated by the NWSSWPC, Alaska and northern parts of Washington have a higher chance of seeing it. Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are also in this range. Other states, including Montana, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, also have a possibility, though the likelihood is lower. Areas in the rest of the world may also see them. For example, the Meteorological Office [predicts](https://x.com/metoffice/status/1844679634954150258) that cloudy skies will limit vision for most of the UK, except for Scotland. This week's stunning aurora borealis displays weren't a surprise. The NWSSWPC issued a G4 storm watch on October 9th, 2024, following a coronal mass ejection from the Sun on October 8th. This powerful solar event had the potential to cause significant disruptions to crucial infrastructure. \"There is potential to reach G4 (Severe) upon arrival of this CME and throughout its passage,\" the NWSSWPC [warned](https://www.spaceweather.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october). Eventually, the storm [got stronger](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-continue-be-observed) than initial predictions. Therefore, this Friday night aurora borealis promises a captivating spectacle for those lucky enough to witness it. However, remember, these predictions can change depending on local weather conditions. Also, the unpredictable nature of this space phenomenon also factors into any chance of viewing.",

    "text": "The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [announced today](https://apnews.com/article/epa-billions-clean-green-energy-community-grants-8f6c76cb41783a5e838ac4f7f7cce086) that it has awarded $20 billion to green banks, financial institutions, and nonprofit organizations for projects combating climate change in disadvantaged communities. Through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), thousands of communities will now receive funding for critical infrastructure and quality of life improvements like heat pumps, electric vehicle charging stations, and community cooling centers. The GGRF is the single largest non-tax investment in the Inflation Reduction Act benefitting historically disadvantaged communities, and selected recipients of these funds have committed to reducing or avoiding up to 40 million tons of carbon pollution annually over the next seven years. Today's announcement marks a large step forward in implementing and advancing climate justice goals in the clean energy transition. Climate Group Executive Director for North America Angela Barranco said: \"Programs like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) play a key part in the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act. As we've seen this legislation evolve over the past two years, thousands of communities around the country are now willing and able to fund and build the infrastructure needed to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency, and put us on a path to a green economy. Climate Group leverages this momentum through effective public-private partnerships. We bring companies, communities, and financial institutions together to make climate action happen at the local level. In partnership with the Center for Climate Strategies, Climate Group's [Green Recovery Alliance](https://www.theclimategroup.org/green-recovery-alliance) works directly with local governments to elevate their voices and steer them through the often-complex federal funding process. We address how these communities can deliver economic growth while prioritizing climate resilience and social equity. With so much at stake, our work is more important than ever to ensure programs like the GGRF facilitate an equitable clean energy transition and communities are equipped with the knowledge, tools, and funding for tangible solutions to the climate crisis.\" [here](https://www.miragenews.com/epas-20b-fund-boosts-local-climate-protection-1209170/).",
