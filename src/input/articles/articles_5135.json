    "title": "Idaho house where 4 students were killed is being razed. Here’s what happened to other homes linked to notorious killings",
    "text": "The University of Idaho on Thursday began demolition of the off-campus home where four students were fatally stabbed last year — the latest instance in which a property is razed following grisly, high-profile killings.\nEthan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were killed inside the Moscow, Idaho, off-campus rental on Nov. 13, 2022,\nstunning the university and the surrounding community.\nThe owner of the home donated it to the university and the school planned to tear it down in July, before the start of the new academic year. But\nthose plans were delayed until this month, when the university announced attorneys for the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, had been given access to the home as part of their preparations for trial. Prosecutors also accessed the house on Dec. 21, the school said.\nPeople are also reading…\nKohberger has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder, and\nnot guilty pleas have been entered on his behalf. Prosecutors have proposed his trial begin in the summer of 2024.\nThursday’s demolition – taking place during winter break – was expected to last several days, the University of Idaho said in a news release this month. But it could be finished within a day, Jodi Walker, university spokesperson Jodi Walker told CNN.\n“It is the grim reminder of the heinous act that took place there,” University of Idaho President Scott Green said in a news release. “While we appreciate the emotional connection some family members of the victims may have to this house, it is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue.”\nOn the eve of the demolition, the families of Goncalves and Kernodle pleaded with the university and local prosecutors to preserve the home. They argued it may provide evidence during the murder trial, including about how much the surviving roommates may have heard during the killings, according to a joint statement.\nBut neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have opposed the demolition,\nthe university said, and a prosecutor told school officials in an email the house is “so substantially different than at the time of the homicides” that a jury wouldn’t be authorized to see it.\nWith the house gone, attention can turn to the property’s future. The university intends to create a\nmemorial garden on the site to honor the four students, it has said, and landscape design and architecture students were set to draft concepts for the garden this past fall.\nThe question of what to do with such properties has become distressingly rote in recent years, particularly in the U.S., where communities regularly have to grapple with the scenes of mass shootings, asking themselves how they honor the victims and their families while allowing those left behind to heal and move forward.\nThat’s particularly difficult following\nmass shootings at schools, where students and teachers face the possibility of having to return: For example, Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, was torn down and rebuilt after 26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-old children, were killed in a shooting there in December 2012.\nBut for decades, communities have faced similar questions about private homes, like the one in Idaho, where notorious killers lived or their victims were murdered. Often these homes are torn down, like the\nSandy Hook shooter’s home, where he lived with his mother – his first victim the day of the shooting.\nHere’s a look at what happened to other homes synonymous with the killings that took place there.\nCharles Manson murders: 10050 Cielo Drive\nIn 1969, five people, including the actress Sharon Tate, were murdered at\n10050 Cielo Drive in what was perhaps the most notorious of the murders carried out by the cult led by Charles Manson.\nThe Beverly Hills, California, home was demolished in 1994, and a new one — a sprawling nine-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion — was built and completed in 1996. It received a new address.\nThe mansion was put on the market in January 2022 for $85 million, but the asking price has repeatedly dropped over the last 23 months. The sellers are now asking $49.5 million, according to the\nreal estate agent’s listing, which makes no mention of the property’s dark history.\nJohn Wayne Gacy’s home\nThe serial killer\nJohn Wayne Gacy killed at least 33 people, and the remains of more than two dozen of them were found underneath his house near Chicago by investigators following his arrest in December 1978, according to the Chicago Tribune.\nGacy’s home was demolished months later, in April 1979, the Tribune reported at the time. It was a relief to neighbors, including one who told the newspaper, “I’ll be glad when every bit of it’s gone.”\nThe lot was empty for almost a decade, until a new home was erected on the site beginning in June 1988, per the Tribune. Like the Cielo Drive house, the new home also was given a new address.\nThe home of Fred and Rose West\nFred and Rose West abducted, sexually abused and killed a series of girls and young women — two of their daughters among them — between the 1960s and 1980s in England. Fred, accused of 12 murders, died by suicide before he could stand trial, while Rose was convicted on 10 counts of murder in November 1995 and sentenced to life in prison.\nWhen the case broke open in the 1990s, investigators found the remains of many of their victims at their house at 25 Cromwell Street in the city of Gloucester, including in the garden, the basement and the bathroom.\nThe home, dubbed a “house of horrors,” was\ntorn down in 1996. A public walkway has since been built in its place.\nAlex Murdaugh’s hunting estate\nBefore it became known as the site where\nAlex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and grown son Paul, the 1,700-acre Islandton, South Carolina, property known as Moselle was the family’s hunting estate – including a house, a cabin and dog kennels where the killings occurred.\nDuring the now-disgraced attorney’s trial earlier this year, jurors visited the estate to help them better understand the crime scene and the prosecution and defense arguments.\nUnlike the other crimes’ sites, however, Moselle is still standing.\nThe estate went up for sale several months after the killings, according to\nCNN affiliate WJCL, and many items from the home were auctioned off soon after Murdaugh’s conviction. He has filed an appeal, which is on hold while his defense attorneys pursue a motion for a new trial.\nThe home was sold for $2.6 million,\nanother affiliate, WCIV, reported in March.\n___\nCNN’s Cindy Von Quednow, Veronica Miracle and Jeffrey Kopp contributed to this report.\n___\nA look at some of the most notorious serial killers in the US since 1970\n1970-2005: Samuel Little\nFebruary-May 1971: Juan Corona\n1972-1978: John Wayne Gacy\n1974-1991: Dennis Rader\n1975-1998: Robert L.

    "title": "\"On l'a testé pour vous\" : quand Lou devient ambassadrice du Pass Culture à Rennes",
    "text": "\"On l’a testé pour vous\" : quand Lou devient ambassadrice du Pass Culture à Rennes\nLou, 21 ans et étudiante en droit à Rennes, est depuis un an ambassadrice du Pass Culture. Une expérience qui lui a permis de développer son goût pour la culture et d’assister à son premier festival de musique.\nDepuis bientôt un an, Lou, étudiante en deuxième année de droit à Rennes (35), est ambassadrice du pass Culture. Un programme national lancé en 2021 destiné à représenter pendant un an les utilisateurs du dispositif auprès des acteurs institutionnels, culturels et de promouvoir les activités de leur territoire. Présent dans 25 villes de France, celui-ci regroupe aujourd’hui plus de 600 jeunes.\n\"Je suis tombée sur la campagne de recrutement un peu par hasard, grâce à un groupe de promo, raconte la jeune femme originaire de Pau Sachant que j'allais bientôt avoir 20 ans, je me suis dit que ça serait chouette de profiter une dernière fois du pass en devenant ambassadrice.\"\n\"C’était le premier festival auquel j’assistais\"\nConcrètement, en quoi ça consiste ? \"On a un groupe WhatsApp et, tous les mois, on reçoit un calendrier avec des événements. Certains sont ouverts à tous et d’autres uniquement aux ambassadeurs comme nous. Il suffit de s’inscrire même si, parfois, il y a un tirage au sort, car les places sont limitées.\" Une mission gérée par Elijha Touchard, chargée d’animation territoriale dont la mission est d’accompagner les ambassadeurs tout au long de l’année.\nEt une opportunité qui a permis à Lou et à ses camarades d’assister à une multitude d’événements : festival des Transmusicales, vernissage de l’exposition photographique Pinault, avant-première d’un spectacle à l’opéra de Rennes, visite au musée des Beaux-Arts…\nPlus qu’un moyen de découvrir l’offre culturelle de leur ville, le rôle d’ambassadeur est aussi de donner son avis pour enrichir et améliorer le dispositif, de partager ses découvertes en tant que porte-parole. \"Les Transmusicales par exemple, c’était le premier festival auquel j’assistais, explique Lou. Pour l’occasion, on a dû monter une sorte de vlog, on a interviewé des ingénieurs du son, des artistes, des personnes qui travaillaient à la restauration…\"\n\"Il n’y a pas que les écrans dans la vie\"\nEt si l’événement ne leur plaît pas ? \"Le but est d’être sincère et moi, quand je n’aime pas un événement, je le dis. On est là pour transmettre et pour dire aux jeunes qu'il n'y a pas que les écrans dans la vie. Leur dire qu’il y a beaucoup de culture à Rennes et nous, on l'a testé pour vous.\"\nL’occasion, surtout, de prendre part à des rendez-vous parfois coûteux lorsque l’on est étudiant, ou simplement méconnus. Son expérience d'ambassadrice a par exemple permis à Lou de mieux appréhender son amour pour l’art. \"Je me souviens d’une exposition au musée des Beaux-Arts et c’était génial, car on a eu beaucoup d’explications. On pouvait toucher les œuvres et ça, c’est vraiment quelque chose que j’apprécie.\"",

    "text": "Mehr als 122 Millionen Menschen weltweit auf der Flucht\nKrieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung: Die Zahl der Flüchtlinge weltweit ist in einem Jahr um zwei Millionen gestiegen.\nMehr als 122 Millionen Menschen sind weltweit auf der Flucht vor Krieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung. Damit stieg die Zahl laut Weltflüchtlingsbericht der Vereinten Nationen binnen Jahresfrist um rund zwei Millionen an. Hauptursachen seien große Konflikte wie im Sudan, in Myanmar und in der Ukraine, erklärte das Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR in Genf zur Veröffentlichung am Donnerstag.\nSeit einem Jahrzehnt habe sich das Ausmaß der globalen Flüchtlingskrise immer weiter verschärft. Ende April seien insgesamt 122,1 Millionen Kinder, Frauen und Männer vertrieben gewesen. Doch während sich die Zahl der gewaltsam vertriebenen Menschen in den letzten zehn Jahren fast verdoppelt habe, sei die Finanzierung für das UNHCR heute in etwa auf demselben Niveau wie 2015. Die anhaltenden Kürzungen der humanitären Hilfe seien unhaltbar und machten Menschen auf der Flucht noch verletzlicher.\nAppell von Flüchtlingskommissar Grandi\nFilippo Grandi, der UN-Hochkommissar für Flüchtlinge, forderte die Weltgemeinschaft auf, ihre diplomatischen Anstrengungen zu verdoppeln. Ziel müsse es sein, Frieden zu schaffen und dauerhafte Lösungen für Menschen auf der Flucht zu finden. Ein Hoffnungsschimmer sei die Rückkehr vieler geflüchteter Menschen in ihre Heimatregionen in Syrien in den vergangenen sechs Monaten nach jahrelangem Krieg und Massenvertreibungen.\nContent-Partnerschaft\nDieser Artikel entstand in einer Content-Partnerschaft mit dem Evangelischen Pressedienst (epd).\nAufgrund der Rückkehr in Heimatregionen oder -länder sank die Zahl der Vertriebenen laut UNHCR seit dem Jahreswechsel wieder etwas: Ende Dezember hatte sie einen Höchststand von 123,2 Millionen erreicht. Dabei nahmen die Binnenvertriebenen, die vor Konflikten innerhalb des eigenen Landes flüchten müssen, den größten Anteil ein. Ihre Zahl wuchs dem Bericht zufolge bis Ende 2024 um 6,3 Millionen auf 73,5 Millionen. Die Zahl der Flüchtlinge bezifferte das UNHCR Ende 2024 auf 42,7 Millionen. Flüchtlinge verlassen ihr eigenes Land und suchen Schutz in anderen Staaten.\nMit 14,3 Millionen Menschen auf der Flucht hat der Krieg im Sudan den Zahlen zufolge die inzwischen größte Vertreibungskrise der Welt verursacht. Dahinter folgen Syrien (13,5 Millionen Menschen), Afghanistan (10,3 Millionen Menschen) und die Ukraine (8,8 Millionen Menschen).",

    "text": "Reuters Videos Nigerian Catholics see no same same-sex blessings soon Reuters Videos Updated December 29, 2023 at 4:58 PM Link Copied Read full article\nSTORY: Nigerian Catholics Jane and her partner Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon.\nAnd that's despite a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nIn Nigeria, as in many African nations, same-sex relationships are criminalized.\nJane believes it could be 20 or 30 years before bishops in her country can accept the pope's decision.\n\"It is also new to them like it's new to every other person, and they have to process it. Until they finish the processing, I think like here in Nigeria we will have to wait. We will have to be very patient.\"\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which allows blessings for same-sex couples as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nBishops from several African countries, including Nigeria, said they will not bless same-sex couples.\nThey argue the change can be interpreted as optional.\nPope Francis, who approved the declaration, has hit back against criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nFather Patrick Alumunku is director of communications for the Catholic Archdiocese of Nigeria's capital Abuja.\nHe says the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers, but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness.\n\"They are also children of God. The judgement, finally of what a person is, depends on God in the very end. I think that’s what the Pope said, who am I to judge?\"\nAlumunku also denied that this was an incremental step towards eventually accepting same-sex unions in church.\n\"The pope's declaration is still in good faith for us.\"\nFor Jane, the fact that the issue is being openly discussed is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n\"We are getting there,\" she said. \"A moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\"\nView comments",

    "text": "Una fuerte tormenta azotó a la provincia de Corrientes generando estragos en todas partes. La ciudad de Bella Vista fue la principal zona damnificada ya que se encuentra sin servicio desde lo ocurrido, además provocó la caída de árboles, voladuras de techos y casas destruidas.\nClima en Argentina: en qué provincias hay alerta amarilla para la noche de Año Nuevo En la capital , las lluvias se desataron a las 4 de la mañana , con unos vientos a 40 kilómetros por hora. Esto causó cortes de luz, árboles derribados y destrucción de viviendas . Según informó Diario El Libertador , el nivel del agua llegó a los 37 milímetros.\nDestrozos en Bella Vista La intendenta de Bella Vista , Noelia Bazzi , dialogó con Radio Dos y comentó cómo se encuentra la ciudad tras el fuerte temporal: “Es una situación muy difícil la que estamos atravesando. Desde la madrugada, a las 2.30, 3 de la madrugada que se empezaron a desatar fuertes vientos . Algo nunca visto, tenemos la ciudad destruida, esa es la realidad”, afirmó.\nAfirmó que la tormenta llegó a la zona céntrica, zona periférica y zona rural : “Estamos trabajando desde muy temprano con el equipo de área social y asistencia a las familias que están complicadas y damnificas. En algunos casos llevándolos al albergue polideportivo, en otros casos, asistiéndolos directamente en el lugar. Los equipos de infraestructura y de producción están i ntentando empezar a reorganizar y reordenar la ciudad. Tenemos muchísimos árboles caídos, plazas completamente destruidas”, afirmó.\nY continuó diciendo: “ Todo es preocupante . Tenemos la ciudad completamente sin servicio, así que se está trabajando en todo lo que tiene que ver con restablecer el servicio: cables caídos, postes caídos. El área de infraestructuras está cortando un poco los árboles para poder, por lo menos, normalizar un poco las calles, porque hay lugares a los cuales ni pudimos llegar porque los caminos no nos lo permiten”.\nLa ciudad completa se quedó sin servicio. Foto: Data Chaco Con respecto a los vecinos de la ciudad, Bazzi aseguró: “ Hay familias que perdieron todo, casas por completo . En algunos casos, voladuras de techos, en otros, cayeron las casas por completo. Todo muy triste, catastrófico en toda la ciudad”. Y añadió: “Tenemos cuarteles de bomberos completamente destruidos, unidades destruidas por la caída de muros, canchas destruidas, productores que perdieron todo”.\nLa intendenta comentó que la principal preocupación es “ asistir a las familias. Todo el equipo municipal está trabajando, mucha gente de la ciudad que se sumó a colaborar con su motosierra , con sus camiones, y el gobierno de la provincia que está monitoreando todo la situación. Estamos desbordados con respecto a los recursos humanos , y ni hablar de la pérdida millonaria que vamos a tener en la ciudad por todos los daños ocasionados”.\nTemporal en Corrientes: más de 600 evacuados y alertan una nueva crecida del nivel del agua También comentó que está recibiendo ayuda de la Provincia: “El ministro Buenaventura Duarte ya está llegando a la ciudad con defensa civil de la provincia. Ya estuve en contacto con el gobernador y con su equipo poniéndolos al tanto”. Y finalizó diciendo: “Estamos poniendo lo mejor de nosotros, pero la verdad que nada es suficiente por lo que estamos atravesando”.",

    "text": "Important Guide to Foundation Repair Work: Everything You Need to Know\nThe \"Important Guide to Foundation Repair: Every Little Thing You Need to Know\" is an extensive source that supplies beneficial insights right into the globe of foundation fixing. In this guide, you will locate comprehensive details on the indications of foundation damages, the causes of foundation problems, various types of foundation fixing methods, elements that impact repair expenses, and the value of hiring an expert foundation repair work service provider.\nIndicators of Foundation Damage\n1. There are 5 key indications that indicate structure damages in a building. Identifying these indications early on is critical to stop more architectural damage and costly repair work. The very first indicator is the appearance of splits in the wall surfaces, both indoor and exterior. These fractures might be horizontal, vertical, or angled and can vary in width - FCS Foundation Repair Dallas Concrete Slab foundation repair. They are commonly an outcome of shifting or clearing up structures, indicating underlying structural concerns.\nThe second indication is unequal or sloping floors. If you see that your floorings are no longer degree, maybe an indicator of foundation issues. This can be observed by placing a degree on different locations of your floor and examining for any kind of disparities.\nOne more indication is doors and home windows that are tough to open or shut. It might be due to foundation negotiation if you find that your home windows and doors are obstructing or sticking. As the structure changes, it can cause the frameworks of windows and doors to end up being misaligned, leading to operational concerns.\nBroken or leaning smokeshafts are also indications of foundation damages. Look for any type of visible splits, spaces, or tilting in your smokeshaft structure. These concerns can arise when the structure clears up, causing the smokeshaft to change.\nFinally, moisture-related troubles such as water pooling around the structure or basement leaks can additionally suggest structure damage. Extreme dampness can deteriorate the structure and compromise its stability, causing further damage over time.\nReasons of Structure Troubles\nOne of the major reasons of foundation problems is improper drainage around the building. When the soil around a structure comes to be saturated with water, it can lead to a rise in hydrostatic pressure.\nOne more usual reason of structure troubles is the presence of extensive dirts.
