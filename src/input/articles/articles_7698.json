    "text": "Si bien el magnesio es uno de los minerales más importantes para el ser humano ya que tiene multiples propiedades para el cuerpo y la mente, un especialista alertó que también puede llegar a ocasionar algunos problemas y explicó cómo reconocerlos.\nEl cardiólogo Aurelio Rojas puso el foco en los beneficios de este nutriente pero también alertó que el consumo en exceso puede ser perjudicial para la salud por lo cuál explicó cuánto es el límite recomendado por día para no tener problemas.\n\"La dosis diaria recomendada varía según la edad y el sexo, pero en promedio es de 310-420 mg al día\", explicó el especialista remarcando que regularmente con una dieta equilibrada pueden tenerse esos valores.\nAdemás, el cardiologo advirtió que \"si estás tomando suplementos, es importante no exceder esa cantidad, ya que dosis altas pueden causar efectos secundarios\". En ese sentido, detalló que su ingesta desmedida puede ocasionar problemas como dolores estomacales, diarreas y migrañas.\nPor otro lado Rojas también se refirió a los tipos de magnesio y cuáles son los mas recomendados. En ese sentido recalcó que el citrato de magnesio y el bisglicinato de magnesio son los más recomendados para las personas. Afirmó que el primero es conocido por su alta capacidad de absorción y su eficacia para aliviar el estreñimiento, mientras que el segundo es ideal para personas con sensibilidad digestiva. También contribuye a la relajación muscular y mejora el sueño.\nPor último, el especialista recomendó dividir la dosis diaria de magnesio en dos tomas, una por la mañana y otra por la noche, momento en el que se absorbe mejor. Asimismo sostuvo que si bien estos suplementos se pueden tomar con agua, lo mejor es combinarlo con alimentos ricos en fibra e hidratos de carbono como la fruta.\nEsta es la fruta rica en magnesio que ayuda a mejorar el sueño\nLos trastornos del sueño son cada vez más frecuentes y por eso es muy importante ingerir esta fruta rica en magnesio para conseguir una solución natural a esta problemática. Se trata de el kiwi, que tiene un alto contenido de magnesio, un nutriente clave que desempeña un papel muy importante en la relajación y en la mejora del sueño. El sitio especializado en salud Healthline aconseja consumir esta fruta antes de dormir.\nEsto se debe a que este mineral está muy presente en la fruta y juega un papel en la regulación de neurotransmisores en el cerebro que inducen el sueño, como la melatonina, la hormona responsable del ciclo de sueño. Además, el magnesio contribuye a la relajación muscular lo cual es otro factor clave para conciliar el sueño y el kiwi es una fruta que puede consumiéndola antes de acostarse puede ayudar a dormir mejor por las noches.",

    "text": "Justice Department is investigating McKinsey consulting firm's role in opioid epidemic By Hannah Rabinowitz and Evan Perez, CNN (CNN) — The Justice Department is investigating McKinsey & Company, one of the world’s largest consulting firms, over its role in advising drug companies on how to boost sales of opioids, according to sources familiar with the matter. Prosecutors from Virginia and Massachusetts are leading the criminal investigation, the sources said, and are coordinating with the Justice Department’s civil division in Washington, DC. The probe is focused on advice that McKinsey gave to pharmaceutical companies about selling the highly addictive prescription drugs, sources said. CNN has reached out to McKinsey for comment. Critics have said that McKinsey’s work to help opioid manufacturers like Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and Endo, supercharge their distribution across the country. McKinsey has already paid [hundreds of millions](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/business/mckinsey-opioid-settlement/index.html) of dollars in settlements nationally for its alleged role in the crisis. [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mckinsey-faces-criminal-probe-over-opioid-related-consulting-a3f816d4) was first to report the criminal inquiry. Abuse of prescription opioid painkillers has become an epidemic in the United States that has been blamed for tens of thousands of deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. McKinsey has said it has stopped working with clients on “opioid-specific business,” and is “continuing to support key stakeholders working to combat the crisis.” The Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation.

    "text": "With Eder Militao and David Alaba both unavailable for the time being after suffering ACL tears, Real Madrid only have two fit centre-backs, that being Antonio Rudiger and Nacho Fernandez. However, that could now go down to one. During the latter stages of the first half against Getafe on Thursday, Rudiger appeared to pick up a knock after he made a strong challenge on Mason Greenwood. The German international was struggling for the remainder of the first period, and at half time, Carlo Ancelotti opted to replace him, with Eduardo Camavinga coming on. Rudiger just hurt himself with that wreckless challenge man 😭😭😭😭😔 [pic.twitter.com/4vlXWBpqrW] — ＲＡＳＴＡ ＶＩＮＩ く影栄 (@7Rastas) [February 1, 2024] It is a worry for [Real Madrid](https://www.football-espana.net/category/la-liga/real-madrid), especially with the Madrid derby against Atleti in just three days’ time. Time will tell whether it is simply a case of Ancelotti not wanting Rudiger to aggravate the issue ahead of a crucial fixture, and Madridistas across the world will certainly be hoping that it is nothing more than this.",
