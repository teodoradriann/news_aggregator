    "text": "USA convinces shipping companies to continue working in Red Sea\nThe Pentagon is convincing shipping companies that the routes through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal are still safe, despite the Houthi attacks, Azernews reports, citing International Media Outlets.\n\"The Pentagon interacts with industry representatives almost daily to assess their needs and assure that the international community is ready to help with safe passage [through the Red Sea and Suez Canal],\" said Defense Department spokesman Bryon McGarry, responsible for the Middle East and Africa.\nHowever, according to Bloomberg, most companies do not want to take risks and seek to rebuild their routes. According to the data cited by the agency, about half of the container ships that regularly passed through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal now avoid these routes.\n\"It will take some time for shippers to assess the security situation,\" said Mark Kancian, senior adviser at the American Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"If it turns out that the United States and the coalition can provide safe passage, then I think they will return. But now they can't be sure of that,\" the expert said. He added that if the US starts shelling Houthi camps, it will probably increase the risk, not reduce it.\nAs analyst Gene Moran pointed out, shipping companies would like the \"American-led coalition\" to combat the threat from the Houthis to \"do more.\"\n---\nFollow us on Twitter\n@AzerNewsAz",

    "text": "Islamists prepare terrorist attacks on Christmas services in Europe An Islamist terrorist cell planned several attacks in Cologne, Vienna, and Madrid. Christmas church services could have been the target, reports [Focus Online](https://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/mehrere-festnahmen-terroristen-planten-wohl-anschlaege-auf-kirchen-in-koeln-und-wien_id_259524527.html). In this regard, several arrests were made in Germany and Austria. A sniffer dog is being used to search for explosives in Cologne Cathedral. \"Due to the current threat assessment of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the still elevated terrorist alert level, there is an overall increased risk during the Christmas holidays in Austria\", the Vienna police said in a statement. The police added that security measures have been tightened in Austria due to possible terrorist attacks. \"As terrorist organizations across Europe have called for attacks on Christian events, in this context - especially around December 24 - security authorities have stepped up security measures in public places in Vienna and the federal states. In particular, the security of vulnerable places and objects is being strengthened,\" the statement said. Search dog used in Cologne Cathedral Security standards have been raised in Cologne Cathedral, including the use of an explosives detection dog. The police will also take special protection measures in connection with the information received about the danger. Germany's State Security Service, which is actively involved in politically motivated criminal offenses, has launched an investigation. \"Even if the lead is related to New Year's Eve, we will do everything possible to ensure the safety of visitors to the cathedral on Christmas Eve. In coordination with the security officer of the cathedral's head, the cathedral will be searched with sniffer dogs after the evening mass and then locked,\" said Michael Esser, head of the Cologne Criminal Investigation Department. Starting on Christmas Eve, all visitors will be checked before entering the church.",

Regresar a casa con el tercer lugar no era lo que tenían en mente, pero estaba en disputa la medalla de bronce y la consiguieron. El partido contra Unifut Antigua se les complicó a las rojinegras en Ciudad de Guatemala. De nuevo encajaron un gol producto de un tiro de esquina. Ese tanto de Mayqueling Márquez incomodó a las manudas, pero no dejaron de luchar. Ya en el ocaso del partido, en el 90′+3, Kenia Rangel rescató a las leonas y con el 1-1 extendió la lucha por el tercer cajón del podio hasta los penales. La misma Rangel abrió la tanda y lo pegó en el palo, pero Noelia Bermúdez le desvió el lanzamiento a Vivian Herrera. Alexia Estrada tapó el tiro de Paula Coto y la guardameta rojinegra hizo lo mismo con una mano en el disparo de Jennifer Barrios. Viviana Chinchilla anotó y Yuvitza Mayén mandó el balón arriba del horizontal. Yoanka Villanueva acertó, al igual que Larissa Fagundes. Marilenis Oporta sentenció la serie por 3-1, con un remate potente que le deparó el tercer lugar a las leonas en la Uncaf.",
