    "text": "Longtemps pointé du doigt pour ses performances en demi-teinte, Kylian Mbappé semble désormais s’épanouir pleinement au Real Madrid, au grand plaisir d’un vestiaire désormais entièrement acquis à sa cause. Kylian Mbappé, désormais joueur du Real Madrid, a partagé son ressenti sur ses premiers mois dans le club lors d’un entretien avec Clique . Bien qu’il ait traversé une première partie de saison compliquée, marquée par des critiques malgré des statistiques correctes, il semble désormais en pleine ascension. Mbappé a souligné l’importance de cette étape dans sa carrière, affirmant vouloir « tout aller chercher sur le terrain ».\nDepuis le début de l’année, le Français a marqué un tournant dans ses performances. Carlo Ancelotti, qui n’a cessé de le soutenir et de souligner son besoin d’adaptation, a contribué à ce renouveau en ajustant son positionnement. Désormais concentré sur en partie sur l’aile gauche, Mbappé utilise mieux ses qualités de vitesse et de dribble, ce qui a transformé son impact sur le jeu.\nLes coéquipiers du capitaine des Bleus sont également conquis. Selon Relevo , le vestiaire madrilène salue son influence croissante et son implication accrue. Lors du Clasico contre le Barça, bien qu’il ait été le seul buteur dans une défaite frustrante, il a été largement encensé par la presse espagnole.\nAncelotti a résumé la situation en conférence de presse : « Il a eu besoin de temps pour s’adapter, mais maintenant, il est dans un très bon moment, et nous devons en profiter. » Mbappé semble enfin prêt à écrire un nouveau chapitre brillant au Real Madrid.\n🚨 𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗗𝗔𝗟 𝗞𝗢𝗟𝗢 𝗠𝗨𝗔𝗡𝗜 🇫🇷 𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗘 𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗨𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗠𝗘𝗡𝗧 𝗦𝗔 𝗩𝗜𝗦𝗜𝗧𝗘 𝗠𝗘́𝗗𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗟𝗘 𝗔̀ 𝗟𝗔 𝗝𝗨𝗩𝗘𝗡𝗧𝗨𝗦 ! 🤍🖤\nL’international français qui s’engagera sous la forme d’un prêt sec portera le numéro 2️⃣0️⃣.\n🗞️ @FabriceHawkins pic.twitter.com/41S7fsLcwI\n— Actu Foot (@ActuFoot_) January 16, 2025",

    "text": "You went from being a roadside computer operator to a social media preacher. Did you see it coming? No, I didn’t see it coming at all. My late father was a pastor and I knew as a child that I had the call of God upon my life, but I was running away from it. But, being one that now preaches on social media, it is something I never saw coming at all. Growing up, I loved the things of the Lord, but along the line, I was carried away by the things of the world. It became tiring and I backslid. But, God corrected me. How did the call come for you? The call has always been there but when I knew that I had no choice but to pick the call of God upon my life was when I had an encounter with Jesus at a friend’s birthday party. That night, I encountered Jesus and that was how my life changed. Jesus came for me by himself and dragged me out of sin. How has the journey been so far? The journey, humanly speaking, is not easy but God has been helping me. He promised never to leave me and he has not left me. When did you know you could put your messages out on social media platforms? I have always had a passion for tech and computers, and I understood before now how the social space worked. So, I knew I could reach out to a large number of people, especially when my video went viral and a lot of people knew me. A lot of people also contacted me. I saw a goldmine in social media and I started recording and posting my messages online. Have you started monetising your content? I haven’t started monetising my content yet. You studied Electrical and Electronics and worked as a graphic designer. Do you miss your job? I still work as a graphic designer but not full-time. Most of my church graphics are made by me. When I am free, I can work for other people but I am not in a rush at all. What are some of the challenges of being a popular social media preacher? The only challenge is that I have to be more disciplined. I cannot do what other people are doing. I am very careful about the content I churn out on social media. This time, I am more like a positive influence on people and I am very careful with the kind of things I do. What are some of the things you can no longer do anymore as a result of your new status? There are some places I can no longer go to because I can’t just be seen there no matter my excuse for being there. I am very careful of the people I mingle with. As a single young man, how do you handle female admirers? It is not really easy handling female admirers but it takes discipline. My mentor always tells me that there are many errors some fathers would not have made if only they were disciplined. So, I try as much as possible to set boundaries so that I don’t fall victim. It is not easy handling them at all because they come in different ways and formats, but the grace of God has been there for me. What doors has stardom opened for you? It has made the message that Jesus Christ gave to me reach a very large audience, and it would not have been possible if I were a popular figure. By the grace of God, I have been able to connect with a lot of the preachers I look up to. It is what gave my ministry a start. When that video went viral, it redefined my ministry and I now knew that I was sent for the youth and teenagers, and showing them the way of God.",

    "title": "‘So much death’: Lawmakers weigh stricter speed limits, safer roads for pedestrians",
    "text": "By Vanessa G. Sánchez, KFF Health News\nLOS ANGELES — The party was winding down. Its young hosts, María Rivas Cruz and her fiancé, Raymond Olivares, had accompanied friends to their car to bid them farewell. As the couple crossed a four-lane main road back to the home they had just bought, Rivas Cruz and Olivares were struck by a car fleeing an illegal street race. The driver was going 70 in a 40-mph zone.\nDespite years of pleading for a two-lane road, lower speed limits, safety islands, and more marked crosswalks, residents say the county had done little to address speeding in this unincorporated pocket of southeastern Los Angeles. Since 2012, this half-mile stretch of Avalon Boulevard had logged 396 crashes, injuring 170 and killing three.\nOlivares, 27, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, became the fourth fatality when he was hurled across the street, hit by a second car, and instantly killed. Rivas Cruz was transported to a hospital, where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Once awake, the elementary school teacher underwent a series of reconstructive surgeries to repair her arm, jaw, and legs.\nIn the aftermath of the February 2023 crash, the county installed protective steel posts midway across the street. But residents, who had sought a platformed center divider and speed cameras, said that wasn’t enough.\n“It’s just a band-aid on a cut. This is supposed to solve it, but it doesn’t, and that is what hurts,” said Rivas Cruz, who now at age 28 walks with a cane and lives with chronic pain. “I go to sleep, and I’m like, ‘It’s just a dream, it’s just a dream.’ And it’s not.”\nThe nation’s road system covers 4 million miles and is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local jurisdictions that often operate in silos, making systemic change difficult and expensive. But amid the highest number of pedestrians killed in decades, localities are pushing to control how speed limits are set and for more accountability on road design. This spring, New York and Michigan passed laws allowing local jurisdictions to lower speed limits. In Los Angeles, voters approved a measure that forces the city to act on its own safety improvement plan , mandating that the car-loving metropolis redesign streets, add bike lanes, and protect cyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians.\nStill, there’s plenty of political resistance to speed enforcement. In California’s Statehouse, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) proposed requiring GPS-equipped smart devices in new cars and trucks to prevent excessive speeding. But after pushback, the state lawmaker watered down his bill to require all vehicles sold in the state starting in 2032 to have only warning systems that alert drivers when they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph.\nAlthough the Biden administration is championing Vision Zero — its commitment to zero traffic deaths — and injecting more than $20 billion in funding for transportation safety programs through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , road safety advocates and some lawmakers argue that the country is still far from making streets and vehicles safe, or slowing drivers down.\n“We are not showing the political will to use the proven safety tools that exist,” said Leah Shahum, founder of Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit organization advancing Vision Zero in communities across the country.\nStill a crisis The need for safer roads took on urgency during the covid pandemic. Fatalities rose even as lockdown mandates emptied streets. In 2022 , more than 42,500 people died on American roads, and at least 7,522 pedestrians were fatally struck — the highest tally of pedestrian deaths in more than four decades.\nExperts cite several reasons for the decline in road safety. During the lockdowns, reckless driving increased while traffic enforcement declined. SUVs and trucks have become larger and heavier, thus deadlier when they hit a pedestrian. Other factors persist as streets remain wide to accommodate vehicles, and in some states speed limits have gradually increased .\nEarly estimates of motor vehicle fatalities show a slight decrease from 2022 to 2023, but pedestrian fatalities are still notably above pre-pandemic numbers . “It’s an encouraging start, but the numbers still constitute a crisis,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote in February of roadway deaths.\nThe Biden administration has directed $15.6 billion to road safety until 2026 and $5 billion in local grants to prevent roadway deaths and injuries. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s new “ vulnerable road user” rule , states with 15% or more deaths involving pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists compared with all road deaths must match federal dollars in their safety improvement spending.\nRoad safety advocates argue the federal government missed an opportunity to eliminate outdated standards for setting speed limits when it revised traffic guidelines last year . The agency could have eliminated guidance recommending setting speed limits at or below how fast 85% of drivers travel on uncongested roads. Critics contend that what’s known as the 85th percentile rule encourages traffic engineers to set speed limits at levels unsafe for pedestrians.\nBut the Federal Highway Administration wrote in a statement that while the 85th percentile is the typical method, engineers rarely rely solely on this rule. It also noted that states and some local agencies have their own criteria for setting speed limits.\nIn response, grassroots efforts to curtail speeding have sprouted across communities. In April, Michigan passed legislation granting local governments authority to round down when setting speed limits.\nAnd after four years of lobbying, New York state passed Sammy’s Law, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, who was killed by a driver in Brooklyn in 2013. The law, which will take effect in June, allows New York City to lower its speed limits to 20 mph in designated areas.\n“With this legislation, I hope we can learn more children’s names because of their accomplishments, their personalities, and their spirit — not their final moments,” said Sammy’s mother, Amy Cohen.\nPush for pedestrian safety Advocates would also like the federal government to factor in pedestrian safety on the five-star vehicle safety rating scale. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a separate pass/fail test that would be posted only on the agency’s website, not on labels consumers would see at the dealership.\nRelated Articles National Politics | Election monitors nervously practice for the ‘big dance in November’ National Politics | Alito’s flag controversy foreshadows contentious Supreme Court rulings National Politics | Election certification disputes in a handful of states spark concerns over 2024 presidential contest National Politics | Election officials, retired lawmakers plead for more money to protect voting National Politics | Greater focus on crime sparks another wave of juvenile justice bills Automakers like BMW questioned the effectiveness of a program testing pedestrian protections in vehicles arguing that in European countries that adopted such a regulation, it’s not been clear whether it led to fewer deaths and injuries. According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, automakers spent about $49 million lobbying in 2023 compared with $2.2 million spent by advocates for highway and auto safety.\n“The federal government has the biggest punch when it comes to requiring improved vehicle safety design,” said Wiener, the California state lawmaker.\nAlthough Wiener modified his proposal to restrict excessive speeding, he has advanced companion legislation that would require Caltrans, the state transportation agency, to make improvements such as adding crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better serve pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.\nWhen that bill was heard in a committee, opponents, including engineering firms and contractors, cautioned it would remove flexibility and hamper the state’s ability to deliver a safe and efficient transportation system. Lawmakers have until Aug. 31 to act on his bills.\nIn Los Angeles, hope for change arrived in March when voters passed Measure HLA , which requires the city to invest $3.1 billion in road safety over the next decade. Rivas Cruz’s house, however, sits eight blocks outside the jurisdiction of the city initiative.\nIt’s been more than a year since the crash, but Rivas Cruz finds reminders everywhere: in the mirror, when she looks at the scars left on her face after several surgeries. When she walks on the street that still lacks the infrastructure that would have protected her and Raymond.\nStories of pedestrians killed in this Latino working-class neighborhood are too common, said Rivas Cruz. In September, she attended a memorial of a 14-year-old who was killed by a reckless driver.\n“There’s so much death going on,” the Los Angeles Unified School District teacher said from her mother’s living room on a spring afternoon. “The representatives have failed us. Raymond and I were giving back to the community. He was a civil engineer working for the city, and I’m a LAUSD teacher.

    "text": "BEIJING: Imagine a driving experience that is as self-centered as it can be: seats, music and temperature that adjust automatically according to your mood, routes planned by the auto-driving system using real-time traffic data, and charging notifications sent in advance based on the nearest charging stations…Increasingly, these futuristic scenarios are turning into reality in China.\nAI has seamlessly integrated into every part of China’s automotive industry, revolutionizing each aspect from intelligent cockpit, autonomous driving, to vehicle design, production, marketing, sales, and after-sale services.\n“It can be a travel expert, planning itinerary for you; it can be a secretary, extracting key information from your phone calls in vehicles; it can also read your facial expressions and gestures, engage in intelligent conversations, and cater to your needs,” shared Mr. Chen Xiaobo, Senior System Architect in iFLYTEK, a Chinese tech giant that has ventured into the realm of intelligent vehicles.\nHuman-like emotions, judgement, and decision-making capabilities are driving unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and personalization. In design,\nAI-powered tools such as AiCube enable designers to generate car sketches in seconds with minimal input. In manufacturing, AI optimizes processes from configuration to quality control, cutting costs by 25%. In marketing, AI analyzes consumer behavior to deliver tailored content, train livestreamers, and slash unnecessary advertising by 70%. In after-sales, AI-powered algorithm enables predictive diagnostics and defect recognition…\nThis shift towards AI-driven innovation is gaining momentum, with over a dozen major automakers, including BYD, Geely, Dongfeng, and Chery, announcing collaborations with DeepSeek. Additionally, companies like XPeng and Li Auto have announced to develop their own AI models, aiming to transform cars into “smart travel companions.”\nAccording to S&P’s data provider IHS Markit, over 75% of new cars produced in China this year will feature smart cockpits-up from just over 50% four years ago. Prices for a regular “smart car” have also been dropping to less than RMB 20,0000 ($30,000).\nAs vehicles evolve from simple transportation tools into “third spaces”-integrating leisure, entertainment, and even office functions—consumers are increasingly seeking a homelike experience in their cars. Ms. Xian Bijuan from the automotive research institute Autohome highlights that 47% of consumers report spending more time in their cars, while 55.3% of buyers are replacing their vehicles with more spacious, comfortable models.\n“In the future, AI will become as essential to cars as water and air to human,” said Mr. Chen.\nWhile car makers are racing to innovate, the intelligent evolution of Chinese cars present vast opportunities for international investment.\nBasemark, a Finnish AR software developer has just entered into the Chinese market this year. “China is poised to become one of the markets with the most abundant AI applications in vehicles. Partnership is essential in your business in China. In collaboration with local hardware suppliers or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), a whole set of solution can be provided”, Paul Yeh and Mr. Xiao Zhihao from the company told China Economic Net (CEN) at China International New Energy Vehicle Technology, Parts and Services Exhibition that concluded in Beijing on Monday. Over 10,000 international visitors participated in the exhibition to seek opportunities of trade and investment.\nVirgilio Gonzalez from Spanish multinational Gonvarri told CEN that as vehicle architectures in China are increasingly intelligent and electrified, sales of related products from their four factories in China are growing at around 20% annually.",

Ahora, la firma de seguridad McAfee ha descubierto 14 aplicaciones infectadas en Google Play Store, y lo más preocupante, es que tres de las cuales tenían más de 100.000 instalaciones cada una . Lo identifican como una puerta trasera de Android llamada Xamalicious y que ya habría infectado a 338.300 dispositivos a través de estas aplicaciones maliciosas. Aunque estas aplicaciones maliciosas ya se han eliminado de Google Play, llegaron a estar disponibles en algún momento, y es probable que te las instalaras. De esta forma, echa un vistazo a alguna de estas aplicaciones fraudulentas por si las tienes instaladas en tu dispositivo Android : Por otra parte, un conjunto separado de 12 aplicaciones maliciosas que llevan esta amenaza, se llegaron a distribuir en tiendas de aplicaciones de terceros a través de Archivos APK. La mayoría de los dispositivos infectados se encuentran en Estados Unidos, Alemania, España, Reino Unido, Australia, Brasil, México y Argentina. El malware después de su instalación, se comunica con un servidor C2 y se activa si se cumplen ciertos requisitos previos específicos como lo geográficos. De esta forma, este malware puede recopilar información del dispositivo y del hardware, puede determinar la ubicación geográfica del dispositivo, puede enumerar todas las aplicaciones del sistema instaladas en el dispositivo e incluso puede informar del estado de los permisos de los servicios de accesibilidad. Por otra parte, también han descubierto, que Xamalicious también es capaz de realizar fraude publicitario en los dispositivos infectados, provocando que el rendimiento de tu móvil sea inferior al estar ocupándose de realizar clics fraudulentos en segundo plano.",

    "text": "Emerging research indicates that disposable plastic containers may introduce hazardous chemicals into food, potentially elevating the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nA study conducted by scientists at Ningxia Medical University in China revealed that heating plastic containers can cause chemical additives to leach into food and beverages, leading to concerning physiological changes.\nIn laboratory experiments on rats, researchers detected significant disruptions in gut microbiota and evidence of cardiac damage after just three months of exposure to plastic contaminants.\nThe rodents exhibited structural heart tissue abnormalities, inflammation, mitochondrial swelling, and even bleeding between myocardial cells. Additionally, their blood showed elevated levels of inflammatory markers, which are known contributors to cardiovascular disease.\nEven brief exposure to plastic leachates—comprising chemicals such as BPA, phthalates, and plasticizers—resulted in pronounced alterations in gut microbiota and inflammatory responses.\nThese findings align with other recent studies demonstrating the accumulation of microplastics in human blood clots and organs. While further research is necessary to confirm these effects in humans, the authors advise exercising caution by avoiding plastic containers for hot food.\nAs plastic exposure emerges as a potential cardiovascular risk factor, reducing daily plastic use may be a prudent step toward better health.\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\nBusiness News\nFebruary 14, 2025 08:29 ET Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony and inflation data were the highlights for the U.S. economics news flow this week.

    "text": "When students at Manhattan&rsquo;s Ramaz Upper School meet with director of college guidance Raphael Blumenthal this fall as part of their college search process, he will have more options to share than in past years &ndash; as long as students and parents are willing to expand their search to include institutions of higher learning in the Holy Land.Blumenthal and nine other college advisers from Jewish day schools in the United States &ndash; including SKA, Ramaz, Ma&rsquo;ayanot, Yeshiva High School for Girls, Bnei Akiva Schools, RASG Hebrew Academy, Frisch School, Beth Tfiloh Dahan Community School, Schechter School of Long Island, and the Melvin J. Berman Hebrew Academy &ndash; recently returned from an exhausting, exhilarating, and eye opening trip to Israel from June 24-27 where they visited nine colleges in four days to learn about Jewish life-rich, antisemitism-free, Hebrew language-focused, cost-effective, three-year options for studying for a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Israel.While many of the college advisers were already familiar with such Israel study options as the decades-old Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University (TAU) overseas programs and the 30-year-old Reichman University (formerly known as IDC Herzliya), the trip was an opportunity to refresh their memories about them and learn about a range of additional options at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Ariel University, Bar-Ilan University, Jerusalem College of Technology/Machon Lev, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, and the University of Haifa.console.log(\"2390 BODY2.

(credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)Many will elect to stay in Israel &ndash; which is in line with the goal of its funder, David Magerman.MAGERMAN HAS long been a supporter of Jewish day schools through his Kohelet Foundation, which was in operation from 2009-2019. His newer venture, the Tzemach David Foundation, founded in 2022, is a grant-giving and operational foundation that is &ldquo;dedicated to transform the Israeli educational system by providing comprehensive support and fostering innovation.&rdquo; A University of Pennsylvania graduate and until recently, a Penn donor, Magerman has been very public in criticizing his alma mater in recent months over both the Palestine Writes festival held a UPenn last September, and anti-Israel and antisemitic protests on the Penn campus in the wake of the Gaza War. The philanthropist has discontinued millions of dollars in support for Penn and has redirected some of his money to Israeli institutions of higher learning.Magerman, who is also a member of Yeshiva University&rsquo;s board of directors, recently gave $1 million to Jerusalem College of Technology/Machon Lev and announced additional $1 million gifts to the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Bar-Ilan University and two others to be announced soon.TAMAR KRIEGER, executive director of the Tzemach David Foundation, notes that supporting institutions of higher learning in Israel &ldquo;became a natural outgrowth&rdquo; of his previous support of higher education in the United States. ;It also fits in with an important goal of Magerman and the foundation &ndash; to encourage young people to make aliyah at a period in their lives before they have become settled in to careers and married life.Krieger shares that one goal of Magerman&rsquo;s new foundation is to &ldquo;make aliyah easier,&rdquo; stressing that &ldquo;olim integration should be a goal.&rdquo; They are hoping that mastery of Hebrew and obtaining a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from a top Israeli university &ndash; while socializing with Israelis and enjoying rich Jewish life on campus &ndash; will help their ultimate successful integration into Israeli society.Krieger is working to operationalize and implement this vision and ultimately share it with college advisers at Jewish day schools in the US. She observes, playfully, &ldquo;We found college advisers to be the low hanging fruit &ndash; they are the ones who tell the students where to go &ndash; they have to have info about student life, in the same way they know about Penn and Binghamton,&rdquo; a leading SUNY university. Before putting together the Israel trip, Krieger and the foundation needed to learn more about the programs the Israeli universities already offer as well as the types of support they offer students.ONE HELPFUL starting point was Maureen Adiri Meyer, who for thirteen years has served as director of Lowy International School at TAU. ;She explains that the university already has a long history of supporting the specialized and evolving needs of students, which predate October 7. The director notes that their support of current students from India, China, the EU and the US, through their dual degree program with Columbia University reflects their ability to meet unique needs of various groups of students. ;Adiri Meyer offers that their experience meeting such needs will be helpful in supporting future students. ;As an example of TAU&rsquo;s ability to adapt, she shares that it began realizing the needs of Modern Orthodox students who began participating in the Columbia program during the Covid pandemic in 2020. ;&ldquo;They were used to Hillel and Chabad on campus and were looking for something,&rdquo; she says. ;&ldquo;Some of our kids were living in Herzliya and coming to Ramat Aviv to learn.&rdquo; These students were choosing to live close to Reichman University where they could take advantage of the robust Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus program of the Orthodox Union. ;As a result, Adiri Meyer and her team collaborated with JLIC to start a program at TAU.RABBI JONATHAN Shulman, who served as the initiative&rsquo;s director at Penn from 2010-2014 and now serves as director of OU-JLIC in Israel, actually credits a pioneering group of gap-year students who approached him nearly ten years ago who pointed out the lack of supports for students from abroad. &ldquo;They came to me and said, &lsquo;Why should we lose out?&rsquo;&rdquo; ;In 2017, a JLIC couple came to Reichman. &ldquo;Increasingly, an idealistic group of students chose to be here,&rdquo; Shulman reports, noting that Hillel on Israeli campuses has always focused on Israelis, but there was &ldquo;no one working in the international student space.&rdquo; The initiative&rsquo;s work then expanded to Bar-Ilan and has continued to grow on campuses throughout Israel.Adiri Meyer feels that creating community for these students on campus &ndash; through JLIC and in general &ndash; will be a major key to the success of the students in Israel. She has enjoyed working with Rabbi Shulman, noting, &ldquo;It has been fabulous working with him since day one.&rdquo;Shulman credits Magerman for his long-time support of JLIC and for helping set up a structure to support foreign students. &ldquo;David has been a visionary and took it to the next level &ndash; even before 10/7.&rdquo; Shulman notes that over 20% of gap-year students remain in Israel and that &ldquo;not all go right to college first.&rdquo; Shulman is pleased to partner &ldquo;with great universities&rdquo; and credits them with continuing to grow and evolve as they offer hybrid programs for these students.The Israel OU-JLIC director also praises the Diaspora Affairs Ministry for their support. Amichai Chikli, Israel&rsquo;s Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, connects his support of the new initiative to current events in Israel and around the world. ;An entire nation under attack ;&ldquo;On October 7, a severe war began not only against the State of Israel, but against the entire Jewish people,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Jewish communities worldwide found themselves under severe attack, culminating in violent riots and displays of hate on elite campuses in North America. The State of Israel serves as a home and refuge for every Jew regardless of their background, and makes great efforts to assist as much as possible. ;&ldquo;The ministry is proud to promote this program in collaboration with the Tzemach David Foundation, aiming to increase awareness of the various study programs offered by universities in Israel,&rdquo; Chikli said. &ldquo;We invite all students to consult with the advisers about the many academic opportunities in Israel.&rdquo;Adiri Meyer is happy to welcome these students to TAU. She feels having these American students complete their undergraduate degrees there can be beneficial both to them and to the university community. She notes that they will receive a top level, affordable, Jewishly rich education in Israel in three years, while also enhancing life on campus.&ldquo;We are the largest university in Israel with 30,000 students,&rdquo; she says proudly, noting that most undergraduates are 23 and after their army service. &ldquo;Having these American students study in the university will add a lot to the university. The more integrated they become, and the more our Israeli students meet smart, talented kids from around the world, the more global they will be.&rdquo;Once Krieger and the foundation better understood the landscape of higher education in Israel, they decided to move quickly to invite college advisers on the quickly but carefully planned Israel trip.ESTHER GENUTH, a member of the College Guidance department at the Frisch School in Paramus, New Jersey, was delighted at the invitation to participate on the trip. ;She notes that her entire department has been observing a trend in the past five years towards more gap year participants staying in Israel to complete army or national service and to remain in Israel for college. She notes that Frisch even offered a panel this year where three Israeli universities shared information about their programs. &ldquo;There has been an even bigger shift this year toward exploring Israel study options,&rdquo; she says.Genuth was pleased with how they were received and with what they learned. &ldquo;The schools were so grateful for us coming,&rdquo; she observes, adding that she was pleased to learn how &ldquo;Israeli schools are adapting and forming new programs for both those who plan to make aliyah or [who] go back to America.&rdquo; ;She feels well prepared to share updated information with her students, which she obtained first hand. &ldquo;Seeing places and meeting people was invaluable,&rdquo; she reports. &ldquo;After the trip and after meeting with JLIC, I have no doubt our students will be successful!&rdquo; ;ANNE GREENSPOON is co-director of college guidance at Berman Hebrew Academy in Rockville, Maryland, where she reports that more than 90% of students traditionally participate in gap year programs in Israel, mostly yeshiva or seminary. &ldquo;In the past, a handful had plans to do a gap year, then IDF service, then maybe come back for college. Now, parents want a backup plan,&rdquo; she says.Greenspoon has observed a shift in her students as they consider post gap-year plans. &ldquo;This year, we saw more students who planned to return to America for college changing their minds. Many are choosing to stay and serve in the IDF.&rdquo; Many of those students may elect to remain in Israel for college.The college guidance co-director further notes that, when she and her Berman colleagues began one-on-one meetings with 11th graders and their parents in January to discuss college options, &ldquo;Many said they were only considering Yeshiva University or Touro (Jewishly affiliated) colleges &ndash; or college in Israel. ;After Passover and the pro-Gaza/anti-Israel encampments, more people asked, &lsquo;what do you know about universities in Israel?&rsquo; We have been talking about this a lot.&rdquo; She notes that the school hosted a webinar in May with Rabbi Shulman of JLIC for their college counselors.For Greenspoon, the Israel trip came at a perfect time. &ldquo;The big thing for our students is that they feel they will miss out on campus life. I think these new programs, where they can attend university in Israel alongside a JLIC community, is a big game changer for our students!&rdquo; She also notes that &ldquo;these new hybrid programs will attract students who are a little older and may be good for those who served in the IDF or did national service.&rdquo; ;She anticipates the concerns of her students&rsquo; parents about both just how competitive the Israel universities are, and how the Israel degree will be viewed if they come back to the US.ADIRA MEYER of TAU assures potential applicants that &ldquo;students will be studying with top academics in a top university.&rdquo; ;And while Ramaz&rsquo;s Blumenthal knows that the Israel university option is not for everyone, he already has a top student in mind for university study in Israel. &ldquo;I am thinking of a student who will thrive at the Technion or Jerusalem College of Technology/Machon Lev &ndash; he will love having Torah learning alongside the academics. ;&ldquo;I am intrigued, excited and impressed with the level of education that Israel universities provide,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They clearly have top-notch experts in their fields. When you think about the Start-Up Nation, they are providing an education that is producing world leaders.&rdquo;It is now up to the college advisers to share their newly acquired knowledge of the Israel university option with their students and their families. Magerman, the universities and the Start-up Nation eagerly await their arrival. ;",

    "text": "Mysten Labs has launched the public testnet for Walrus Protocol, a decentralized storage network designed to store large data files such as videos, audio, and images.\nThe testnet, built on the Sui ( SUI ) blockchain, introduces several key features, including the ability to delete stored files, a staking system, and an explorer tool for users to search and manage data, according to a press release.\nDecentralized storage distributes files across multiple independent storage nodes rather than relying on a single company to store data (as with traditional cloud services), providing better security and resilience.\nWalrus Protocol uses a method that breaks large files into smaller pieces, distributing them across different locations. Even if some pieces are lost, the entire file can still be reassembled, ensuring users maintain continuous access to their data.\nYou might also like: Polymarket users jockey over $50m ‘Trump coin’ bet Walrus on Sui The Walrus testnet is powered by Sui, a blockchain that helps manage the storage system efficiently. It also supports a testnet token called WAL, which allows users to stake tokens (temporarily lock them in the system) and earn rewards for helping run the network.\nThe protocol aims to make decentralized storage fast and reliable for applications that store rich media.\nTwo notable partners, Akord and Decrypt Media, are joining Walrus. Akord is moving its secure storage platform to Walrus from Arweave, and Decrypt Media is integrating to store its media files on the network, according to the release.\nYou might also like: Crypto expert who earned $500M on Kaspa is bullish on this crypto gem under $0.001",
