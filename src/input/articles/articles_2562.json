    "text": "Rakesh Jain, MD, MPH, notes that with increasing ADHD trends, a newly-available and FDA-approved non-stimulant tool can help treat more patients.\nIn this Contemporary Pediatrics video interview, Rakesh Jain, MD, MPH, clinical professor, psychiatry, Texas Tech University School of Medicine, discussed the now-available, [FDA-approved clonidine hydrochloride (ONYDA XR; Tris Pharma)](https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/fda-approves-clonidine-hydrochloride-to-treat-adhd-in-patients-6-years-and-up), and how having this tool can go a long way to helping more pediatric patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nThis extended-release, liquid formulation is a non-stimulant treatment option that expands the toolkit for managing this increasingly prevalent condition.\n\"Stimulants really do have a very good signal of effect. That effect is probably only for about 60 and if you’re lucky, 60 to 70% of children and adolescents,\" Jain explained. However, for those who do not respond to stimulants, treatment options have been limited. \"I’ve had no once-a-day clonidine, FDA-approved treatment options available whatsoever, and now with it available, my choices to offer either as monotherapy, or sometimes in combination therapy, just dramatically went up.\" This broader range of options offers hope for improving academic, social, and family life for patients.\nADHD prevalence is rising nationally, and the complexity of cases is increasing. Jain noted, \"ADHD is on a march upwards, and not in a good way. And this isn’t a problem in [just] Texas or Massachusetts or Montana or California [or any one state]. The most recent Centers for Disease Control survey of ADHD in our community show that what you are seeing in your clinics is actually true. The numbers of males and females is going up.\" He emphasized that ADHD affects all demographics, transcending race and socioeconomic status.\nWhat Jain finds particularly concerning is the increasing complexity of ADHD presentations. \"I’m seeing more complexities. I see more behavioral disruption. I see more difficulty with body weight. I see more difficulty with anger outbursts. I see more troubles with sleep difficulties,\" he said.\n\"It's almost as if the simple ADHD, whatever that is, doesn't present commonly. It's the more complex scenarios. Therein lies the reason why I'm so excited [to have] more treatment options that fit into a patient's life,\" said Jain.\nJain expressed enthusiasm for ONYDA XR’s convenience and accessibility. \"Bid medications are hard to fit into a patient’s life. Once-a-day medications are easier, and a lot of my kids just don’t take pills or capsules for a variety of reasons. So having a liquid formulation that’s once a day and a non-stimulant on top of it, it is a cause for celebration by all clinicians, psychiatrists, primary care, general pediatrics.\"\n[In a previous video interview, ](https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/rakesh-jain-md-mph-discusses-once-daily-clonidine-hydrochloride-onyda-xr-for-adhd)Jain broke down the once-daily treatment, in part saying \"There's a lot of valuable assets this formulation has that fits nicely with the current clinical needs in psychiatry practices and pediatric practices,\" said Jain. \"It is once a day. It is liquid, and that, of course, is really important to remember. It is to be used just once a day in a liquid formulation, and it can be used either as monotherapy, or it can be used in combination with stimulants.\"\n[Addressing atypical anorexia: Part 2](/view/addressing-atypical-anorexia-part-2?utm_source=www.contemporarypediatrics.com&utm_medium=relatedContent)\nDr. Erin Harrop discusses the necessity of understanding that eating disorders do not all look the same in every patient and how a multidisciplinary approach could be an effective way to diagnose and manage anorexia nervosa that is atypical.",

    "text": "A 102-year-old World War II Navy veteran from New York died while traveling to France to take part in a ceremony to honor the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion that turned the tide of the war toward Allied victory.\nRobert Persichitti was traveling to Normandy by ship with a veterans group , headed to the site of the historic June 6, 1944, war milestone.\nOn the ship, he suffered a medical episode and was airlifted to a hospital in Germany, where he died, Richard Stewart, the president of veteran organization Honor Flight Rochester, told NBC News on Thursday.\nStewart said he received the call informing him of Persichitti’s death on Friday — news no one expected as “he was active, sharp as a tack, right up [to the end].”\n“His health was age appropriately very good up to 102. He had some heart problems, but he checked with his doctor, who said, ‘Absolutely go on the trip,’” Stewart said. “He passed away peacefully, he was around people.”\n“The doctor found some Frank Sinatra music, which was his favorite,” Stewart added.\nPersichitti, of Fairport, New York, was described as a “humble” man who “had a great life.”\nHis vibrant, centurylong journey began with his childhood in the Allegheny Mountains outside of Pittsburgh. He lived through the Great Depression, joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, and when World War II broke out he enlisted in the Navy, spending a year in New York City attending radio school and learning Morse code.\nHe spent 15 months at sea assigned to the command ship USS Eldorado in the Pacific as a junior radio operator through the end of the war, serving in Okinawa, Iwo Jima and Guam, Stewart said.\nHe witnessed the historic moment Marines raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi during the battle of Iwo Jima in February 1945 — which was captured by photographer Joe Rosenthal and became one of the most iconic images of the war, Stars and Stripes reported.\nHe returned to Mount Suribachi in 2019 as part of a veterans program with the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, telling a Stars and Stripes reporter at the time, “When I got on the island today, I just broke down.”\nPersichitti was named to the New York state Senate’s Veterans Hall of Fame in 2020.\nAfter the war, he settled in Rochester, New York, where he spent 40 years as a shop teacher with the Rochester City School District, teaching carpentry and other technical skills to students, and where he joined Honor Flight Rochester, which takes veterans to visit D.C. memorials.\nIn 2015, he published the autobiography “Building an American Life.”\nHe also regularly visited students in Pittsford, New York, near Rochester, to speak about World War II. In April, the Pittsford Central School District shared photos of students celebrating Persichitti’s 102nd birthday.\nPersichitti was an active part of Honor Flight Rochester, and most recently attended events in April and May, shaking the hands of hundreds of veterans.\n“When Bob said he was going to be someplace to do an event to help spread the word with Honor Flight, he was there, he’d be in his orange shirt. He was a great volunteer for us,” Stewart said. “I think we all had every intention that if he got back from his Normandy trip on Father’s Day, he would have been there in June, shaking hands.”\nStewart noted that Persichitti’s wife had preceded him in death and he had no children.\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com .

    "text": "Borrell teme que Israel inicie una invasión terrestre en Líbano: «Hay un altísimo peligro»\nEn cuanto a si cree que hay posibilidades de un alto el fuego, ha admitido que quiere creerlo, pero «cada día es más difícil»\nEl jefe de la diplomacia europea, Josep Borrell, ha afirmado este jueves que teme que Israel inicie una invasión terrestre en Líbano en el marco de la escalada de tensión en Oriente Próximo: «Hay un altísimo peligro».\nSegún Borrell, la Unión Europea lleva tiempo «temiéndolo» e intentando que no ocurra. «Pero en este momento lo que hay es un altísimo peligro», ha dicho este jueves en una entrevista en Cadena Ser, recogida por Europa Press.\nEn cuanto a si cree que hay posibilidades reales de un alto el fuego en Líbano, Borrell ha admitido que quiere creerlo, pero «cada día es más difícil seguir creyéndolo».\nPreguntado por si el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, se ha convertido en un peligro para el mundo, el Alto Representante ha advertido que «desde luego» la guerra en Líbano sería una «amenaza terrible» para la seguridad y para la paz en la región «y eso, es quizá el objetivo, arrastraría a Irán», ha augurado.\nEl Ejército israelí ha llevado a cabo este jueves una nueva oleada de bombardeos contra objetivos del partido-milicia chií libanés Hezbolá en el sur del Líbano en el marco de la campaña intensificada de ataques aéreos contra el país desde el lunes.",
