He was 56, 20 years over the maximum standard enlistment age, but he was a Boys’ Own kind of man and the army was desperately short of doctors. He was also—surprisingly—a highly controversial, left leaning, non-conformist pacifist.\nHe had exemplary credentials as professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Oxford’s Green Templeton College, and consultant at John Radcliffe Hospital and Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre. Having taken up his chair in 1992, he left in 2008 to become the oldest officer trainee at Sandhurst royal military academy. He said, “I found myself there with all these 20 year olds, learning to polish boots and dismantle a rifle.”\nIt was not an easy time. Bulstrode was fit and strong for a man of his age, but he lost two stones in six weeks. He was such a bad marcher that he was taken out at dawn by a sergeant major for additional practice before the passing out ceremony.\nTerritorial Army\nHis phone call to the army recruiting office had followed a “stultifying General Medical Council meeting.” As a GMC member for several years he had tried to drive change, but the council, he told Victoria Hunt, his second wife and partner for the last 25 years, “didn’t do change.” …\nView Full Text\nLog in\nLog in using your username and password\nLog in through your institution\nSubscribe from £173 *\nSubscribe and get access to all BMJ articles, and much more.\n* For online subscription\nAccess this article for 1 day for:\n£38 / $45 / €42 (\n[excludes VAT](/company/eu-vat-rates/))\nYou can download a PDF version for your personal record.",

    "text": "ARC Ltd. has secured a $27 million contribution from the Dutch government aimed at bolstering climate resilience across Africa.\nThe funding will be administered through the African Development Bank’s Africa Disaster Risk Financing Programme (ADRiFi) Multi-Donor Trust Fund, marking the Netherlands as the sixth donor to join this initiative. This support will specifically enhance the accessibility and affordability of parametric insurance and other climate risk management tools across the continent.\nLesley Ndlovu, CEO of ARC Ltd., expressed gratitude for the Netherlands’ contribution, highlighting its pivotal role in reducing the protection gap and facilitating premium support to make parametric insurance more accessible.\nEstablished in 2019, the ADRiFi programme, a collaboration between the African Development Bank and ARC Ltd., aims to expand insurance coverage against climate risks in Africa. Since its inception, the partnership has provided financial protection to over six million individuals, demonstrating significant progress in enhancing the continent’s resilience to climate shocks.\nThe programme’s success is underscored by robust support from international donors, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the United States, Canada, Norway, and now the Netherlands. With the Bank’s investment exceeding $100 million, 16 African countries have accessed sovereign insurance and financial protection against climate hazards.\nParametric insurance, a cornerstone of the initiative, ensures swift payouts based on predefined criteria such as cyclone intensity or rainfall excess, expediting financial assistance to affected communities. This mechanism plays a critical role in mitigating the socioeconomic impacts of natural disasters, particularly among vulnerable populations.\nThe ongoing efforts of the ADRiFi programme underscore a collective commitment to safeguard African nations against the escalating impacts of climate change, promoting sustainable development across the continent.",

    "title": "11 Influential Japanese LGBTQ+ Novels to Read",
    "text": "From groundbreaking literary works to contemporary masterpieces, here are 11 of the most influential Japanese LGBTQ+ novels that offer a glimpse into the diverse experiences of Japan’s queer community.\nSpanning from historical classics to modern breakthroughs, these authors provide rich, nuanced portrayals of love, self-discovery and resilience. They not only reflect the complexities of queer identity in Japanese society but also challenge conventions and open up discussions about acceptance and equality. Where available, we’ve also noted if an English translation exists for international readers.\n1. The Co nfessions of a Mask (1949) – Yukio Mishima ( Available in English )\nA seminal work in Japanese queer literature, Confessions of a Mask follows Kochan, a young man growing up in post-war Japan who struggles with his attraction to men while attempting to conform to societal expectations. Mishima’s semi-autobiographical novel is a deeply introspective examination of repression, self-deception, and the burden of maintaining a facade in a rigidly heteronormative world. Through poetic and often unsettling prose, this novel remains one of the most influential works in LGBTQ+ Japanese literature.\n2. The Little House (2010) – Kyoko Nakajima ( Available in English )\nTold from the perspective of an elderly housemaid recalling her past, The Little House is a nostalgic and emotionally rich narrative set in pre-war Tokyo. As she reflects on the family she served, subtle yet profound themes of same-sex attraction emerge, adding layers of complexity to an already intimate portrayal of love and secrecy. Nakajima delicately explores how societal norms and unspoken desires shape relationships, making this novel a quietly powerful read.\n3. あのこは貴族 “Aristrocrats”(2009) – Mariko Yamauchi (Japanese only, English translation not yet announced) Set in contemporary Tokyo, this quietly incisive novel follows Hanako and Miki, two women from vastly different backgrounds connected through the same man. Hanako, raised in wealth, becomes engaged to Koichiro, a lawyer from a similar class. Miki, who dropped out of Keio University due to financial hardship, meets Koichiro while working at a lounge. Their affair continues even after his engagement.\nAs Hanako and Miki come to know each other, the novel unpacks the intersecting pressures of class, gender, and social mobility. Rather than focusing on romance, it explores a subtler kind of queerness—how women relate to each other within, and against, the roles society assigns them.\n4. Lonely Castle in the Mirror (2017) – Mizuki Tsujimura ( Available in English ) This bestselling fantasy novel follows a group of isolated students who are magically transported to a mysterious castle, where they must navigate a world filled with secrets and unspoken truths. While not explicitly an LGBTQ+ novel, Lonely Castle in the Mirror subtly explores themes of identity, alienation, and self-acceptance, offering an allegory for the struggles of queer youth in Japan. Its emotionally resonant storytelling makes it a must-read for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider.\n5. Breasts and Eggs (2020) – Mieko Kawakami ( Available in English ) A bold and thought-provoking novel, Breasts and Eggs delves into themes of body autonomy, gender, and class, centering around three women navigating their own personal struggles. One of its key subplots involves a transgender character confronting Japan’s rigid societal norms. Kawakami’s candid and unflinching prose challenges conventional narratives on womanhood and identity, making this a groundbreaking and essential read.\n6. If Cats Disappeared from the World (2012) – Genki Kawamura ( Available in English ) While not explicitly LGBTQ+, this heart-wrenching novel explores themes of love, loss, and relationships. All through the story of a dying man bargaining with the devil to prolong his life. Within its tender narrative lies a subtle but profound contemplation of different forms of love. This includes those that defy traditional norms. Kawamura’s storytelling is simple yet deeply affecting, leaving readers with a lingering sense of introspection.\n7. 火花 “Spark” (2015 ) – Naoki Matayoshi ( Available in English ) A witty and heartfelt novel about the struggles of an aspiring comedian, Spark offers an unexpected yet compelling romantic subplot. Matayoshi weaves humor and vulnerability into the narrative, highlighting the challenges of navigating queer identity in Japan’s male-dominated entertainment industry. The novel’s charm and emotional depth make it an engaging and thought-provoking read.\n8. 飼育 “Prize Stock” ( 1958) – Kenzaburo Ooe (Available in English) This 1958 novella, which won the Akutagawa Prize, follows a young boy in a rural Japanese village during WWII as he and other children capture and interact with a downed Black American pilot. While not known as an LGBTQ+ work, some scholars have noted the homoerotic undertones in Ōe’s depiction of male characters and their intense, often physical interactions. These readings highlight how emotional and bodily intimacy between boys in Ōe’s writing can invite queer-adjacent interpretations, even if not explicitly intended.\n9. Vita Sexualis (1909) – Ogai Mori (Available in English)\nOften cited as one of the earliest examples of modern Japanese literature to openly address sexuality, Vita Sexualis is a fictionalized memoir of a man reflecting on his sexual development. Though not a queer novel in a modern sense, the narrator reflect on early same-sex experiences and attractions, including a schoolboy crush and interactions with male classmates. These moments are often described in a detached, clinical tone, but they are present and several scholars have examined how the novel’s repression, ambiguity, and emotional distance toward women can point to queer subtext or internalized desire, particularly in the context of Meiji-era masculinity. The book was banned shortly after publication, highlighting the discomfort it provoked around non-normative expressions of intimacy.\n10. In Praise of Shadows (1933) – Jun’ichiro Tanizaki (Available in English)\nWhile technically an extended essay rather than a novel, In Praise of Shadows is a poetic meditation on aesthetics, traditional architecture, and Japanese notions of beauty and sensuality. Tanizaki’s lingering descriptions of dimness, tactility, and the eroticism of obscured forms have fascinated queer theorists and readers alike. The essay’s sensual, moody tone—and its implicit contrast to modern Western rationalism—has led some to explore its queerness as an aesthetic and spatial sensibility rather than an identity.\n11. Bath Towel (1996) – Jiro Fukushima (Available in Japanese only)\nNominated for the 115th Akutagawa Prize, Bath Towel is a short story that portrays a same-sex relationship between a high school teacher and his male student. Based on Fukushima’s own experiences as a teacher and poet in Kumamoto, the story explores desire, power, and taboo with raw emotional clarity. Fukushima later published an autobiographical novel revealing a relationship with Yukio Mishima, further cementing his cult status in queer literary circles.",

    "text": "Demografischer Wandel Stadtrat beschließt: Fünf Kindergärten in Weimar werden geschlossen\nHauptinhalt\n26. Juni 2025, 08:27 Uhr\nDer Weimarer Stadtrat hat die Schließung von fünf Kindergärten beschlossen. Aufgrund des demografischen Wandels wird die Stadt bereits im kommenden Jahr Hunderte Kindergartenplätze nicht mehr benötigen.\nIn Weimar werden fünf Kindertagesstätten geschlossen. In sieben weiteren Kitas werden Plätze abgebaut. Nach langer Diskussion hat der Stadtrat am Mittwochabend einen neuen Kita-Bedarfsplan beschlossen. Er sieht vor, dass die Stadt bis zum Sommer 2026 insgesamt 500 Kindergartenplätze abbaut.\nNach Prognosen werden im März 2026 von den aktuell 3.448 Plätzen nur noch 2.570 belegt sein. Grund seien der demografische Wandel mit weniger Geburten und die damit einhergehende sinkende Kinderzahl.\nStadtratsfraktionen weisen Vorwürfe zurück\nDer Abstimmung ging eine emotionale Diskussion voraus. Vorwürfe anwesender Eltern, der Prozess sei intransparent und nicht nachvollziehbar gewesen, wiesen so gut wie alle Fraktionsvertreter zurück. Sämtliche Ausschusssitzungen seien öffentlich und Vertreter des Stadt-Elternrates anwesend gewesen, sagte beispielsweise Dirk Rühling von den Grünen.\nAuch die Linke hält die Einschnitte für notwendig, werde den Prozess und die Umsetzung jedoch kritisch begleiten, sagte Stadträtin Marit Haferkamp. CDU-Fraktionschef Jörg Geibert sieht ebenfalls keine Alternative, hält die beschlossenen Kita-Schließungen jedoch nur für einen ersten einschneidenden Schritt. Auch 2026 werde man wieder über Reduzierungen sprechen müssen.\nWolfram Wiese von der SPD und gleichzeitig Vorsitzender des Jugendhilfeausschusses sagte, dass niemand diese Entscheidung gern gefällt habe und es auch niemanden leichtgefallen sei. Wirtschaftlich seien hunderte freie Kita-Plätze jedoch nicht vertretbar. Die AfD stimmte als einzige Fraktion gegen den Bedarfsplan.\nEltern von der Entscheidung enttäuscht\nEltern zeigten sich enttäuscht von der Entscheidung, die mit 24 Ja, vier Nein-Stimmen und neun Enthaltungen den Stadtrat passiert hat. Sie hingen nun in der Luft und müssten sich mit ihren Trägern beraten. Schließen werden die Kindergärten in Taubach, Gelmeroda, der Kulturkindergarten am Goethepark und Benjamin Blümchen. Die Kita Tröbsdorf wurde bereits leer gezogen.\nMDR (cma/jn)\nDieses Thema im Programm: MDR THÜRINGEN - Das Radio | Regionalnachrichten | 26. Juni 2025 | 07:30 Uhr",

    "title": "Audi Q6 e-tron : le meilleur SUV électrique du moment ?",
    "text": "Ne jamais juger au premier coup dâ€™Å“il. DerriÃ¨re un design sans ambition ou sans relief peut parfois se cacher un trÃ©sor de technicitÃ©. Lâ€™adage vaut pour les essais automobiles comme pour le reste, mais disons que dans le premier cas les surprises sont plus rares. Câ€™est Ã ce genre dâ€™Ã©tonnement que nous avons pourtant Ã©tÃ© confrontÃ©s avec lâ€™\nAudi Q6 e-tron. Non pas que son esthÃ©tique soit indigne, au contraire, mais son classicisme nâ€™avait pas soulevÃ© en nous un vent dâ€™optimisme Ã lâ€™idÃ©e dâ€™en prendre le volant.\nPourtant, aux termes dâ€™un essai atypique, dans lequel le Q6 e-tron nâ€™a pas Ã©tÃ© placÃ© dans des conditions favorables, le SUV dâ€™Audi a fait part dâ€™un rare talent et dâ€™un niveau de performance emballant. Câ€™est cet essai, sur les routes escarpÃ©es du Pays-Basque que nous avons choisi de vous raconter.\nUn SUV Audi de plus ?\nLâ€™histoire de ce Q6, ne commence pourtant pas de la meilleure des maniÃ¨res. Câ€™est celle dâ€™un espace quâ€™Audi nâ€™a pas voulu laisser vacant. Entre les 4,59 m du\nQ4 e-tron et les 4,92 m du Q8 e-tron, la firme dâ€™Ingolstadt sâ€™est dit quâ€™il y avait de la place pour un SUV de plus au catalogue. Un vÃ©hicule qui aura accumulÃ© les retards et qui aura dÃ» laisser (au terme dâ€™un dÃ©veloppement laborieux) Ã son prestigieux cousin le Porsche Macan, le soin dâ€™Ã©trenner leur plateforme commune, la bien nommÃ©e PPE (Premium Platform Electric) et ses allÃ©chants 800 V.\nMÃªme designer joue encore\nNous ne reviendrons pas trop longuement sur lâ€™esthÃ©tique du Q6 e-tron. Cette question a dÃ©jÃ fait lâ€™objet dâ€™un article et dâ€™une vidÃ©o lors de notre dÃ©couverte en avant-premiÃ¨re du dernier SUV dâ€™Audi. Lâ€™arrivÃ©e du Q6 e-tron dans la gamme Ã©lectrique dâ€™Audi rÃ©pond sans doute Ã une exigence commerciale quâ€™il est difficile dâ€™apprÃ©hender. La firme aux quatre anneaux est convaincue quâ€™il y avait non pas une place, mais une nÃ©cessitÃ© de proposer un nouveau modÃ¨le entre un Q4 e-tron (qui serait trop petit pour certains clients) et un Q8 e-tron qui pourrait paraÃ®tre surdimensionnÃ©. Ainsi, alors mÃªme quâ€™il Ã©tait actÃ© que le prochain vÃ©hicule basculerait sur la plateforme de nouvelle gÃ©nÃ©ration du groupe, la PPE, le Q6 se devait de respecter un minimum de cohÃ©rence stylistique.\nCela explique Ã bien des Ã©gards pourquoi la prise de risque est moindre sur le design du Q6 e-tron, notamment en comparaison de ce qui se passe sous le capot et sous le plancher. Vous lâ€™aurez compris, lâ€™esthÃ©tique du Q6 e-tron nâ€™a rien de rÃ©volutionnaire, elle sâ€™inscrit complÃ¨tement dans la voie qu’ont tracÃ©e les derniers SUV dâ€™Audi, mais ce nâ€™est pas une raison pour lui en tenir rigueur.\nUn habitacle de nouvelle gÃ©nÃ©ration\nDe nouveau design il en est question en revanche dans lâ€™\nhabitacle de ce Q6 e-tron. Audi a complÃ¨tement revu sa planche de bord pour passer au Â« digital stage Â», un systÃ¨me Ã triple Ã©cran rÃ©solument futuriste et, il faut lâ€™avouer, trÃ¨s stylÃ©. Aux deux Ã©crans principaux (11,9 pouces pour lâ€™instrumentation, 14,5 pouces pour les mÃ©dias) sâ€™ajoute un troisiÃ¨me affichage, en option, pour le passager. Telle est la tendance dÃ©sormais sur les vÃ©hicules premium, et si on peut toujours sâ€™interroger sur lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt dâ€™un Ã©cran de plus, force est de constater quâ€™il trouve sa place presque naturellement dans cette nouvelle planche de bord.\nPour gouverner cet ensemble, câ€™est encore une fois le systÃ¨me MMI qui est Ã la manÅ“uvre, cette fois basÃ© sur une architecture Android Automotive quâ€™Audi a souhaitÃ©e trÃ¨s discrÃ¨te. MalgrÃ© les possibilitÃ©s de sâ€™appuyer sur un environnement Google, Audi privilÃ©gie sa propre interface et ce nâ€™est pas toujours heureux. Si celle-ci a pu, par le passÃ©, apparaÃ®tre comme un modÃ¨le Ã suivre, ce nâ€™est dÃ©sormais plus le cas. VÃ©ritable usine Ã gaz, elle met les nerfs du conducteur Ã lâ€™Ã©preuve dÃ¨s lors quâ€™il sâ€™agit de modifier un rÃ©glage quelconque. Soyons clairs, MMI ne manque pas de possibilitÃ©s de personnalisation, ni dâ€™options (le nombre de rÃ©glages sur le comportement de la voiture en atteste), mais elle souffre dâ€™un manque cruel dâ€™intuition et dâ€™ergonomie. Un exemple : le mode de fonctionnement du freinage rÃ©gÃ©nÃ©ratif est une aberration alors mÃªme quâ€™il est lâ€™un des plus complets et lâ€™un des plus aboutis du marchÃ©.\nQue vaut le Q6 e-tron sur la route ?\nNâ€™y allons pas par quatre chemins, le Q6 e-tron nous a emballÃ© comme rarement un SUV Ã©lectrique ne lâ€™avait fait jusquâ€™ici (hormis peut Ãªtre le trÃ¨s atypique Ioniq 5 N, mais dans un style trÃ¨s diffÃ©rent). Le dernier nÃ© des SUV dâ€™Audi est non seulement des plus plaisants Ã conduire mais il fait aussi preuve dâ€™une rare personnalitÃ©. Son chÃ¢ssis efficace et prÃ©cis est sa principale rÃ©ussite. Ã€ tel point que mÃªme dans les montagnes escarpÃ©es du Pays Basque, le Q6 avec ses 4,71 m et ses 2 350 kg sur la balance se balade comme un chat entre les gouttiÃ¨res.\nEt lorsquâ€™il faut montrer les muscles ? Aucun souci, ses 580 Nm sont lÃ , en soutien dâ€™une direction ferme et prÃ©cise, notamment dans un mode Â« Sport Â» quâ€™on ne peut que recommander vivement. Le bilan est Ã©galement plus que satisfaisant en matiÃ¨re de suspension, celle-ci sâ€™avÃ©rant efficace et adaptÃ©e quel que soit le style de conduite pour lequel on opte. En revanche, il convient dâ€™ajouter que notre modÃ¨le dâ€™essai Ã©tait pourvu des suspensions pilotÃ©es, une option Ã 2 260 euros, qui nous semble indispensable pour tirer profit des capacitÃ©s du Q6 e-tron, mais qui aurait dÃ» Ãªtre proposÃ©e de sÃ©rie.\nUn bijou de technologie\nLa cousine de la Porsche Macan frappe donc trÃ¨s fort en termes de conduite et les ingÃ©nieurs dâ€™Audi ne sâ€™y sont pas trompÃ©s lorsquâ€™ils ont optÃ© pour un systÃ¨me Ã double moteur mais basÃ© sur des technologies diffÃ©rentes. En effet, contrairement Ã la majoritÃ© des constructeurs qui optent pour des moteurs Ã©lectriques Ã aimants permanents, Audi a fait le choix de rÃ©server ce procÃ©dÃ© uniquement au moteur arriÃ¨re. Ã€ lâ€™avant, câ€™est un moteur asynchrone Ã induction qui a Ã©tÃ© choisi. Sa spÃ©cificitÃ© ? Il est totalement dÃ©sengagÃ© lorsquâ€™il nâ€™est pas utilisÃ©, sans consommation dâ€™Ã©lectricitÃ© ni freinage passif. En revanche, lorsquâ€™il vient en soutien du moteur arriÃ¨re, son efficacitÃ© est redoutable, et la consommation dâ€™Ã©nergie reste maÃ®trisÃ©e.\nAutonomie : merci la grosse batterie (et le 800 V)\nDotÃ© de qualitÃ©s dynamiques rares, le Q6 e-tron parvient-il Ã doubler la mise avec une autonomie qui lui permettrait dâ€™Ãªtre catÃ©gorisÃ© parmi les grands voyageurs ? Ã€ cette question, notre rÃ©ponse sera malheureusement incomplÃ¨te. Doublement incomplÃ¨te mÃªme, puisquâ€™en plus de nâ€™avoir pas pu rouler suffisamment pour avoir un aperÃ§u complet de la consommation du SUV, il nous faut souligner que notre essai sâ€™est essentiellement dÃ©roulÃ© sur les routes montagneuses du Pays-Basque. Autrement dit, la consommation que nous avons constatÃ©e peut difficilement sâ€™appliquer Ã un usage classique, urbain ou mÃªme mixte. Certes, quelques portions autoroutiÃ¨res sur notre parcours ou encore un crochet prÃ¨s de San Sebastian permettent dâ€™avoir un aperÃ§u de lâ€™autonomie rÃ©elle du Q6 e-tron, mais il nous faudra sans doute complÃ©ter ce premier essai par un autre pour avoir une indication fiable de la consommation rÃ©elle du dernier-nÃ© des SUV dâ€™Audi.\nToujours est-il quâ€™au terme de notre pÃ©riple, la consommation sâ€™est Ã©tablie Ã 22,8 kWh/100 km. Câ€™est un chiffre relativement important dans lâ€™absolu, mais plutÃ´t intÃ©ressant sur un parcours essentiellement montagneux et si on prend en compte le gabarit imposant du SUV. Pour contrer sa consommation Ã©levÃ©e, le Q6 e-tron a deux atouts majeurs : une Ã©norme batterie de 100 kW et une capacitÃ© de recharge rapide ultra Ã©levÃ©e Ã 270 kW. Ces deux mÃ©ritent-elles quâ€™on snobe complÃ¨tement la partie efficience ? Certainement pas, mais il nâ€™en demeure pas moins que le dernier SUV dâ€™Audi posera rarement des soucis en matiÃ¨re dâ€™autonomie. Dâ€™une part parce quâ€™en conditions idÃ©ales sa grosse batterie peut le porter, thÃ©oriquement, sur 623 km. Dâ€™autre part parce que dans les cas oÃ¹ il faudrait passer par la case recharge, celle-ci s’effectuera en un temps record. Le constructeur avance deux chiffres en la matiÃ¨re : un 10 % Ã 80 % en 21 mn ou la possibilitÃ© de rÃ©cupÃ©rer 255 km dâ€™autonomie en 10 min de recharge sur une borne rapide. Ces valeurs sâ€™entendent dans des conditions idÃ©ales bien sÃ»r mais elles en disent aussi trÃ¨s long sur les performances dont le Q6 est capable. Enfin, il est un dernier Ã©lÃ©ment sur lequel Audi sâ€™appuie considÃ©rablement : une courbe de recharge trÃ¨s bien tenue qui permettrait au SUV de tenir son pic de puissance mais aussi de continuer Ã charger Ã 150 kW mÃªme Ã 70 % de batterie. Sur ce point Ã©galement un test plus long, axÃ© sur lâ€™autonomie, devrait permettre de confirmer ou dâ€™infirmer les chiffres.\nLe prix de la haute performance\nAlors bien sÃ»r, comme souvent chez Audi, il y a lâ€™Ã©ternelle question du prix. Compte tenu du niveau technologique de la bÃªte et de ses penchants pour le premium, la facture est naturellement salÃ©e. La version de base du Q6 e-tron dÃ©bute Ã 83 450 euros, une paille. Quant Ã notre modÃ¨le de test, la solide SQ6 e-tron, elle frise les 100 000 euros dans sa version la plus classique, sans option Ã 99 870 euros. Ã€ ce niveau de prix, il nâ€™y a pas beaucoup de concurrence sÃ©rieuse, certes, mais il nâ€™y a pas beaucoup dâ€™acheteurs non plus.\nVerdict du test :\nVous lâ€™aurez compris, nous avons adorÃ© lâ€™Audi Q6 e-tron. Nous nous attendions Ã Ãªtre quelque peu dÃ©Ã§us ou du moins peu emballÃ©s. Ce sentiment nÃ© au lendemain dâ€™une officialisation dâ€™un design trÃ¨s sage a volÃ© en Ã©clats dÃ¨s lors que nous avons pris le volant du nouveau SUV Ã©lectrique dâ€™Audi. Son Ã©quipement complet, son niveau de technicitÃ© Ã©levÃ©, mais surtout ses qualitÃ©s dynamiques rares en font un vÃ©hicule Ã©lectrique trÃ¨s rÃ©ussi. Certes, le bilan nâ€™est pas parfait avec notamment une consommation Ã©nergÃ©tique quâ€™Audi nâ€™a pas rÃ©ussi Ã rÃ©duire suffisamment. Ce point qui aurait Ã©tÃ© rÃ©dhibitoire sur une quantitÃ© de modÃ¨les, nâ€™empÃªche pas le Q6 e-tron de marquer les esprits. Sa surconsommation, le SUV dâ€™Audi la compense avec une batterie gigantesque et une vitesse de recharge record. Certes, le procÃ©dÃ© manque de finesse, mais le rÃ©sultat demeure satisfaisant. Dommage aussi pour lâ€™interface qui ne permet pas de profiter agrÃ©ablement des innombrables possibilitÃ©s de personnalisation du SUV. Au final, le Q6 e-tron offre une polyvalence rare. Celle dâ€™un vÃ©hicule Ã la fois capable de longs voyages en Ã©lectrique, mais aussi de sacrÃ©es sensations sur la route.\nðŸ”´ Pour ne manquer aucune actualitÃ© de 01net, suivez-nous sur\n[Google ActualitÃ©s]et",
