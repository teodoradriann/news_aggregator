    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "Reino Unido: ‘goodbye coal’",
    "text": "Dicho y hecho. El lunes 30 de septiembre cerró la última central de carbón del Reino Unido tal como había anunciado en 2015 Amber Rudd, entonces ministra de Energía y Cambio Climático. En funcionamiento desde 1967, la central de Ratcliffe-on-Soar llegó a emplear a tres mil ingenieros, la plantilla fue menguando a medida que otras fuentes de producción de electricidad iban ganándole terreno al carbón. Al cierre solo tenía 170 empleados. Con la clausura de Ratcliffe llegó a su fin la era del carbón en el Reino Unido, la fuente de energía sobre la que había construido un imperio planetario; la que propulsó la revolución industrial, primero con la máquina de vapor y luego con la generación de electricidad. El carbón, que calentó los hogares europeos durante generaciones, era asequible, fácil de almacenar, disponible. Durante la primera mitad del siglo XX la producción de electricidad dependió exclusivamente del carbón. Pero además del calor, el mineral también emitía partículas contaminantes al aire, como comprobaron los londinenses en 1952. Ese año a principios de diciembre, una niebla densa y negra cubrió la ciudad al extremo de dejarla “ciega”. Peor aún, esa mezcla de humo y niebla llamada “smog”, mató a miles de personas por afecciones respiratorias y cardíacas. Paradójicamente, el carbón, que había permitido alumbrar las calles de Londres con la electricidad producida en la central de Holborn Viaduct, construida en 1882 por Thomas Edinson, la sumió en la oscuridad con las partículas que emitía a la atmósfera los días de niebla. Desde 1938 sabemos que la combustión del carbón tiene otro efecto, menos visible pero igual o más pernicioso. Ese año el ingeniero británico Guy Callendar descubrió que la temperatura global del planeta había aumentado 0,3 grados centígrados en 50 años, y lo relacionó con las emisiones de dióxido de carbono a la atmósfera al quemar combustibles fósiles, principalmente carbón. Era el efecto invernadero. No le hicieron caso, y cayó en el olvido, pero el paso del tiempo le ha dado la razón. La comunidad científica lleva décadas alertando sobre el fenómeno del cambio climático, pero los responsables políticos van a su ritmo. Desde el protocolo de Kyoto de 1997 hasta hoy las emisiones siguieron en aumento y los desarreglos del clima son cada vez más catastróficos como acaba de ocurrir con las inundaciones en Europa central. Así que la noticia que llega del Reino Unido es alentadora y un ejemplo para los demás países, la demostración de que sí se puede alcanzar un objetivo en un plazo dado. Es más, el cierre de la central de Ratcliffe se adelantó un año gracias al rápido crecimiento de las energías renovables en el Reino Unido, y eso a pesar de la crisis energética provocada por la invasión rusa de Ucrania. En contraste Alemania tuvo que reabrir temporalmente algunas de sus centrales de carbón en 2023, y hasta 2030 no se desprenderá totalmente del carbón, su segunda fuente de generación de electricidad. Los países industrializados están en deuda con la humanidad por su responsabilidad en el cambio climático. El Reino Unido, que abrió la primera central de carbón para generar electricidad para uso público en Holborn Viaduct, es hoy el primer país en abandonar el carbón. Salda su deber moral y contribuye a reducir las emisiones globales de CO2. Well done!",

    "text": "Kentucky mother, son celebrating special birthdays LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - People born on February 29, or “leaplings,” as they are called, get one actual birthday every four years. Research shows that only around five million people on the planet are leaplings. We caught up with UK student Emma Perry during a shoot with the university’s social media department, highlighting her big day. On Thursday, this accounting major is celebrating her fifth birthday and her 20th year. She says growing up, she had mixed feelings when her actual birthday didn’t come around. “I feel like sometimes I felt like I don’t have an actual day to celebrate, but also, my parents did a really good job of making sure that I felt celebrated, and I kind of celebrated the 28 and the first instead of just celebrating the 29,” Emma said. Emma will have a special birthday dinner with her mom who’s driving three hours from Hopkinsville to Lexington. Nancy Schoenberg also has a leap day birth birthday. “So today [leap day], I celebrate my 15th birthday. I’ll let you do the math on that one,” Nancy said. Nancy says growing up, her mother took a unique approach when her birthday didn’t fall on a leap year. “Mom, she would celebrate half birthdays, so come August 29, we would have another celebration, so my family never made me feel like I was lacking in any way,” Nancy said. “But when the 29 comes along, we would really celebrate because it doesn’t come along very often.” Nancy is traveling to New Orleans to celebrate. There is a one in 2.1 million chance a leap-year mother would have a leap-year baby. Leapling Cyndy Miller gave birth to her son Stinson on her actual eighth birthday at 32 years old. Cyndy says Stinson’s birth was close to midnight, almost missing the 29. “Obviously, there was a reason for it, but there was no exact timing on anything,” Stinson said. Now, Cyndy will be celebrating her 18th birthday, and Stinson will be celebrating his tenth birthday, at 72 years and 40 years old respectively. “I’m happy to be here, not thrilled about the seven in front, but I’m happy to be here,” Cyndy said. “We’re going to fit four years into one, right? So we gotta go all out,” Stinson said. The Millers tell us they are indeed going all out with a party at Mirror Twin Brewing in Lexington and expect 60 guests, some from out of town, to help them celebrate the big day.

ESSEN, Germany ( [ChurchMilitant.com](https://www.churchmilitant.com/)) - A former Muslim who converted to Christianity after experiencing a miraculous healing has been fined by the city of Essen for displaying a tiny Bible verse on his taxi's rear window. Essen's road traffic authority has accused taxi driver Jalil Mashali of illegal \"religious advertising\" for a sticker that has Jesus' words from the Gospel of John: \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\" Mashali, who has lived in Germany for 22 years, was asked to remove the Bible verse in October 2023 and was threatened with a fine of up to 1,000 euros if he failed to do so, but he has so far declined to remove the sticker. The convert is insisting that the Bible verse does not constitute religious advertising due to the content, location and small size of the sticker. However, the authorities are now demanding a fine and fees of over 88 euros. Mashali is now challenging the fine, and he's supported by the [Alliance for Defending Freedom International](https://adfinternational.org/news/german-taxi-driver-fined-over-tiny-rear-window-bible-quote-sticker). \"Jesus is the best thing I could recommend to anyone because He changed my life. That's why I have the sticker on my car for anyone who is interested to see. I'm not looking to cause trouble, but I haven't done anything wrong,\" the convert boldly declared. \"I am grateful for this country where everyone should be free to share their faith. I hope to be able to continue to do so by appealing the unjust fine,\" Mashali, who was born and raised a devout Muslim in Iran, added. The convert was born and raised a devout Muslim in Iran. He had to undergo over 20 surgeries after losing his lower left leg in a traffic accident at the age of 13. The operations left him with chronic pain and wearing a prosthesis. At the age of 33, hoping to alleviate the pain in his leg, Mashali sought further medical treatment in Germany. However, the pain remained unrelenting and drove Mashali to consider committing suicide at the hospital. At this point, a Christian woman approached him and offered to pray with him. Although skeptical, he accepted. When the pain in his leg fully ceased following her prayer, he began reading the Bible and was later baptized as a Christian. Mashali continued living and working in Iran and eventually married and had two sons. \"In a free society, the government should not be silencing peaceful expressions of faith. Jalil's actions are protected by the basic human right to freedom of religion, which includes the right to share one's deeply held convictions with others,\" [said](https://adfinternational.org/news/german-taxi-driver-fined-over-tiny-rear-window-bible-quote-sticker) Dr. Lidia Rieder, legal officer for ADF International. In comments to Church Militant, Dr. Christian C. Tiews, a missionary of the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod in Germany, said he personally knew of Jalil Mashali's conversion and Christian witness. Tiews said he works on a daily basis with Iranian immigrants, alongside his colleagues from the Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church and missionaries from the Confessional Lutheran Church of Finland. \"According to Germany's Federal Ministry for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), 36% of Iranian immigrants to Germany cite Christianity as their religion (Islam comes in second at 32%),\" Tiews observed. \"There seemed to be two reasons for this: many Iranians are aware of the ancient Persian king Cyrus who is mentioned in the Old Testament no less than 19 times,\" Tiews explained. \"Secondly, the Ayatollah Khamenei is inadvertently driving many people from Islam because of that religion’s cruelty, treatment of women, etc., which he and the mullahs enforce. (Note the protests enforcing the wearing of hijabs in recent years),\" he added. \"While a certain percentage of them may cite Christianity for tactical reasons, in order to be granted asylum, I can confirm that many Iranians are converting to Christianity because they have truly experienced Christ and the gospel,\" he missionary said. Asked why both the Catholic Church and Protestant state church were not attracting a high proportion of converts from Islam, Tiews said that \"the Iranians shy away from the liberal Protestant state church in Germany because they find its views on sexuality offensive.\" \"At the same time, Roman Catholic churches require at least a year of instruction before holy baptism can take place. While well-intentioned, Rome's focus does not seem to be on Christ first and foremost,\" the pastor argued. \"Our Iranian friends are starving for the gospel, hungry for Jesus Christ, and eager to receive the Holy Spirit in baptism as soon as possible. That is what conservative Protestant churches are giving them,\" he [emphasized](https://www.dw.com/en/german-churches-see-rise-in-baptisms-for-refugees/a-38771600#:~:text=Thousands%20of%20refugees%20in%20Germany,especially%20seeing%20many%20new%20converts.&text=Gottfried%20Martens%2C%20a%20pastor%20at,has%20already%20baptized%201200%20refugees.). A convert from Islam who requested anonymity told Church Militant that he had decided not to convert to Catholicism in Germany because the German Catholic Church was pushing homosexuality and the ordination of women, which \"is haram (forbidden) even in Islam.\" Trinity Lutheran Church in Berlin, led by Pastor Gottfried Martens, currently has more than 1,400 converts who speak Farsi and Dari (a language spoken in Afghanistan). \"We don't just baptize them and proclaim 'Hallelujah!' We really check them out,\" Martens said in an [interview](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/july-august/germany-refugee-muslim-christian-convert-asylum-claims.html). \"Thirty percent of them fail.\" \"I make it very clear from the beginning, that conversion and baptism do not increase the chances of receiving asylum, rather, it could make it worse,\" Martens emphasized. \"The BAMF will hardly look at the application if they see it is a Christian from Iran.\" Muslims who convert face the death penalty for apostasy and are attacked and persecuted by fellow Muslims even in a Western democracy like Germany, the pastor explained. \"Many [of the Iranians who have fled to Germany] were also in private house-held congregations in Iran or were touched by the Christian faith during their escape journey,\" Martens noted. Some of those Martens baptized have already been deported. Several churches in Hannover and Berlin have opened special courses in Persian, Arabic and Dari to introduce asylum seekers to Christianity. The Persian Pentecostal \"Alpha and Omega\" congregation in Hamburg is also very popular with refugees from Iranian and Afghan backgrounds. [Have a news tip? Submit news to our tip line](/TipLine).

    "text": "Fountain Mountain operates at the forefront of aquatic ecosystem management, bringing specialized knowledge to property owners struggling with water quality challenges across diverse geographical regions and climate zones. Established through years of dedicated research and practical application in both residential and commercial settings, the company delivers scientifically-backed solutions that transform stagnant, problematic water features into vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystems. Their approach merges technical understanding with accessible education, creating lasting improvements rather than temporary fixes to common water management issues that plague countless property owners year after year.\nThe firm specializes in comprehensive water health assessments, custom aeration planning, and technical guidance for both decorative and functional water installations. Fountain Mountain evaluates each situation through multiple lenses - biological activity, chemical balance, physical structure, and seasonal variations - before recommending specific equipment or management protocols. This method ensures clients receive exactly what their particular water feature requires, avoiding the pitfalls of one-size-fits-all solutions that waste resources without addressing underlying problems that plague many ponds and lakes.\n\"Water features represent significant investments that can either become ongoing headaches or sources of pride and enjoyment for decades to come,\" notes a company spokesperson from Fountain Mountain. \"Most property owners notice problems like excessive algae, unpleasant odors, or murky water, yet remain unaware these symptoms stem from oxygen depletion and poor circulation throughout various depths of their water features. When properly addressed through appropriate aeration technology and strategic equipment placement based on scientific principles, these issues resolve naturally as the ecosystem rebalances without chemical dependency or constant maintenance interventions that disrupt natural biological processes.\"\nMany professionals seeking to buy Kasco fountains discover that equipment selection represents merely one component of effective water management. Fountain Mountain addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing crucial factors often overlooked during purchasing decisions, such as pond depth profiles, existing stratification layers, nutrient load, and surrounding landscape features. These assessments prevent the common and costly mistake of installing inadequately sized or inappropriately configured equipment that fails to create the circulation patterns necessary for healthy water. The company's technical advisors frequently identify situations where different approaches might deliver superior results, saving clients from poor investments while achieving better environmental outcomes.\nFountain Mountain distinguishes itself through unwavering dedication to ecological principles rather than quick-fix solutions. The company continuously monitors emerging research on aquatic ecosystems, incorporating new findings into recommendations that balance aesthetic desires with biological requirements. This commitment extends to energy consumption considerations, helping clients calculate long-term operational costs alongside initial investment figures. Through this thorough approach, Fountain Mountain builds lasting relationships with clients who appreciate straight-forward advice delivered without unnecessary technical jargon or sales pressure.\nLandscape architects and facility managers exploring Scott fountains for sales opportunities appreciate Fountain Mountain's transparent technical specifications and performance expectations. The company provides detailed information about water movement patterns, spray height variations under different wind conditions, and practical maintenance requirements that influence total ownership costs. This no-nonsense approach helps professionals avoid common pitfalls when selecting equipment for client projects. Fountain Mountain maintains extensive documentation on various installation scenarios, allowing for confident recommendations based on real-world performance rather than manufacturer claims alone. This resource proves invaluable for projects where water feature success directly impacts client satisfaction and professional reputation.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Fountain Mountain, Inc.\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: (800)-319-3854\nAddress: 2351 Thompson Way, C-2\nCity: Santa Maria\nState: CA 93455\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.fountainmountain.com/",

Ad Fans of Survivor season 48 commented on Star's time on the show:\n\"sad to see her go but I’m obsessed with Star not playing her shot in the dark honestly. she came to play SURVIVOR and respected the sanctity of tribal council by keeping her vote wow,\" a person wrote . \"Star was criminally under-edited and despite that still became a fan favorite. She was authentically genuine in expressing herself and played this game with a refusal to go with the flow that was infectious to watch. I’d love to see her get a second chance,\" a fan commented . Ad \"The way this cast ostracized Star right from the beginning never felt right with me. Eva voting Star out before 3 non alliance members after Star literally gave her an idol is just nasty. Star you deserved better than this cast,\" a tweet read . Fans of Survivor season 48 further said:\n\"Star clearly the best person on the season and I need an explanation ASAP for why the editors haven't been showing her and the other contestants talk about her the way they do....\" a person wrote . Ad \"We need to have a real discussion around why Star’s visibility was intentionally downplayed. She was clearly a magnetic presence on that island, but I guess it was more important for the editors to illustrate how blatantly obvious it is that Joe and Eva get to the end,\" a fan commented .",
