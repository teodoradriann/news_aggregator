    "title": "Fact Check: Elon Musk Has NOT Announced A Water-Powered Car Engine As Of November 14, 2024",
    "text": "Did Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly announce plans to introduce a car with a water-powered engine in November 2024? No, that's not true: There is no record that Musk or Tesla formally introduced this concept, such as trustworthy media reports. An online AI detector tool found that images published in a post about the supposed announcement were almost certainly fakes made by ai art generators. The account that shared the post has also published dozens of similar reports of far-fetched tech supposedly created by Musk. The claim appeared in a [post](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02SvjhSW2uSnyW3MXq2i1r1GgMTDZiY4eUaAvx1R7JBXQABNjZNZPXfNgfdkQZu7Pvl&id=61553944216415) (archived [here](https://archive.is/gq9e9)) on Facebook on November 10, 2024. Above two images of Elon Musk standing next to what appeared to be car engines, the caption said: Elon Musk: 'Tesla's New WATER ENGINE Will Destroy Entire EV Industry!' Elon has done it again. This time, he's introducing something that could change the world forever--a water-powered engine. Tesla's latest breakthrough is a car that runs on water, producing nothing but clean water vapor and leaving zero harmful emissions. After leading the electric vehicle revolution, Elon is now flipping the script and pushing a technology that seemed impossible not too long ago. This is how the post appeared at the time of writing: (Source: Facebook screenshot taken Thu Nov 14 16:50:00 2024 UTC) The post did not provide any information to support this claim, such as when or where Musk purportedly announced these plans, nor did it link to any credible documentation. Lead Stories ran the two images in the post through an artificial intelligence (AI) detection tool on TrueMedia.org, a self-described deepfake detector website.

By Jan. 12, 2023, statewide snowpack was at [189% of normal](https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-snowpack-snow-survey-usda-governor-spencer-cox-water-conservation-great-salt-lake-rain) for that time of year. Solitude Mountain Resort officials said they [ hadn't seen so much snow by mid-January ](https://kutv.com/news/local/solitude-reports-most-snow-by-mid-january-in-18-years-winter-weather-ski-mountain-resort-utah-snowboard-big-cottonwood-canyon)since the 2004-2005 winter season. Despite the crowds that flocked to resorts, avalanches in the canyons were also a major concern for officials.

This winter has been a different story thus far, with low statewide snowpack levels as of Jan. 3. Despite this, experts said reservoirs [remain mostly full ](https://kutv.com/news/local/utahs-low-snowpack-raises-concerns-despite-reservoirs-remaining-mostly-full-winter-snow-weber-basin-water-conservancy-district)because of snowpack from 2022-2023.",

    "title": "Advice: When my boyfriend sees one part of my body during sex, it kills the mood entirely.",
    "text": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? [Send it to Jessica and Rich here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx34-uOijrCIKqMdw5hnyYahSJBKa4AaSzDCu1nfcpmd3IjA/viewform). It’s anonymous! Dear How to Do It, I’m a 34-year-old woman, and I’ve been dating Dave (33 M) for a few months. The sex has generally been good, but we do have an issue I was hoping you could help with. I have a tattoo on my lower abdomen. It’s a little stick figure pushing a lawnmower right above where I keep my pubic hair trimmed like he’s shaving it off. I think it’s cute. Dave thinks it’s hilarious and will occasionally burst into bouts of giggling when he sees it. It totally kills the mood when we’re getting down and dirty, and it happens maybe one-third of the time we have sex. And when I say “kills the mood” I don’t just mean it takes one or both of us out of it. It often kills his erection and he starts telling jokes instead of continuing. Then I start laughing too, and while it is nice, it’s not sex. I’d have thought our time together would acclimate him to it, but he finds it as hilarious as the first time we slept together, and I see no sign of it getting better anytime soon. Is there a way I can get him to stick to sex when we’re actually having sex? —Tattoo Trouble Rich Juzwiak: As usual, I would like to know a little bit more information. If they’ve been dating for a few months, we can assume that they’re probably having a decent amount of sex. This is cutting into sex a third of the time. What does that actually look like? Are they having sex twice a week instead of three times a week? I think that information would help us understand the stakes here. Because if you’re just having a fun, nice time and you’re still having regular sex, well, I understand it’s a distraction, but unless you want to take the obvious route of removing the tattoo to remove the laughter, it seems like something to just roll with. Jessica Stoya: For a moment, I thought maybe crotchless panties that over the tattoo would work, but then I figured Dave would probably also find those really funny. Rich: We’ve talked about laughing and smiling during sex before, which I really enjoy. I think it’s great to have that. I wish that our writer could see and understand that, and translate that dynamic into fun sex. I understand that the issue here is a repeated distraction, but sometimes that happens. Is it that difficult to get back into it once you’ve been pulled out of the mood by some laughter? Not for me. Jessica: But apparently for Dave, it is really hard to return to sex mode. The fact that Dave, who is in his mid-30s, finds this so entertaining may point to a general youthfulness in his personality that the author might want to really consider the long-term ramifications of and benefits of. Rich: Right. Jessica: No relationship has everything. For me personally, I would rather have a really joyful relationship that contains spontaneity and playfulness than have one where that energy is absent, but you have consistent, reliable sex that is not interrupted by mirth. Our writer has to kind of decide for themselves: What trade are they willing to make here? Rich: Yes, and I would say go where the wind blows during this situation. If this is a moment where you’re about to have sex and then you start laughing about that tattoo and you both forget about sex because you’re no longer horny, then it makes sense to not have sex at that moment. It kind of works itself out. But if Dave is laughing and our writer is still horny and his dick isn’t hard, and for whatever reason it’s not responsive to further trying, then just say, “We’re supposed to have sex. I understand we’re doing something different now. How about if we just hang out and you can help me get off? Because I’m still horny, so kiss me, finger me, do something next to me. We’ll still have the experience, it won’t be intercourse per se, but it’ll be something, and that way I’ll get off and you being soft won’t be an issue.” Jessica: Yes. Rich: Also, I have to wonder how much they’ve actually talked about this. Is this something that’s happened that she’s been silently stewing about the whole time, or have they talked about strategies? Because it seems like he should at least be amenable to her saying, “Look, this has become a distraction, I’m not really into that. What can we do about that? Can you not look at it? Could I cover it in some way? I could get a temporary tattoo. I could totally cover it up. Can I turn around so you can’t see it? We have all of these options.” Jessica: They can turn the lights off, too. Rich: All of this stuff is doable. But I’m going to ultimately say that laughter in a relationship, wherever you find it, is not a bad thing. Sex is good, laughter is good. You don’t want your ratios to get too unbalanced, but in general, if you’re having regular sex, you’re laughing sometimes, and sometimes the laughing takes over the sex, then you’re still having sex. So I have to wonder how big of a deal it actually is in the grand scheme of things. But also, there are so many other options. So first, talk to him and see what you can do. Say: “This is distracting, it’s actually starting to bother me. What can we do about it? Can we laugh a little bit less about this?” Jessica: Then work out solutions together that both people are on board with. Rich: Yeah, exactly. If he’s not willing to do that, well, that’s data. Again, use this as a kind of litmus test. You’ve been seeing him for a few months, and now you’ve come upon an issue. Is he willing to solve that issue with you? That can indicate how strong the partnership is as a preview for the future. Jessica: Yeah, both his behavior and the ability of the two of them to work together will be more apparent after our writer starts tackling this. More Advice From Slate I’m in my early 40s and dating again, and I’ve discovered something a little unnerving about myself. After deciding I wanted a partner, the last three men I’ve had sex with over the last couple of months (I’m a woman) have all been great in bed. However, none of them have put a condom on after I’ve asked them to when we’re getting naked the first time. [They acknowledge I’ve said it, and I’m holding a condom out, but then they go down on me or do something else amazing and I’m instantly into it and I don’t care about anything else.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/03/men-condoms-request-sex-advice.html)",

BAT4406F is an ADCC-enhanced, fully humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody developed by Bio-Thera.\nThe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II/III clinical trial, led by Professor Chen Xiangjun of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University (China), is being conducted across 45 sites in China. Following a formal review of interim data, the IDMC concluded that BAT4406F demonstrated statistically significant efficacy, meeting the pre-defined superiority criteria, and recommended early trial termination due to compelling efficacy. Based on this recommendation, Bio- Thera has decided to close enrollment ahead of schedule and begin preparation to file for regulatory approval from NMPA.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2025",
