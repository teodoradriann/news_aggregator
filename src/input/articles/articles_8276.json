    "text": "Former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon will report to prison on July 1 to serve a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the January 6 select committee.\nNEW from— Raheem. (@RaheemKassam)\n[@thenatpulse]: BREAKING: Steve Bannon Must Report to Jail by July 1, Says Judge.\nFormer Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon, ......\nREAD ON:\n [June 6, 2024]\nNBC News\nreports:\nA federal judge on Thursday ordered former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to report to prison on July 1 to begin a four-month prison sentence for defying subpoenas from the Jan. 6 Committee after a higher court rejected his appeal.\nBannon was found guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress in July 2022 for defying the committee’s subpoenas, but his sentence had been put on hold while he appealed the case. U.S. District Judge Carl said Thursday he did not believe that the “original basis” for his stay of the imposition of Bannon's sentence existed any longer after an appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction. Bannon could still appeal Nichol’s ruling that he must report to prison.\n“‘The defendant chose allegiance to Donald Trump over compliance with the law [sic],’\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Molly Gaston…told jurors.” That’s not going to sound so bad soon.

This way, they can shut down Bannon's popular podcast for four months during election season.\nHere's a longish post to close things out:\nRemember, this is a misdemeanor.— Jeff Clark (@JeffClarkUS)\nFor the Biden Administration, if this stands, it’s mission accomplished:\nTake Bannon out for close to the full span of the run up to the 2024 presidential election. And even if Trump grants him a pardon later, they can’t give him a time machine…\n [June 6, 2024]\n… they can’t give him a time machine to undo time already spent under lock and key.\nThink about where that leaves the country.\nThe Supreme Court needs to intervene in this attempt to shut down a key voice before the election. And they can do a lot simply by granting a stay pending resolution of a cert petition and then Bannon could stay free until late September at least.\nI’m sure Bannon’s lawyers have their cert petition up on the drafting table now. (The DC Circuit likely will deny a stay.)\nAnd the Supreme Court should go farther and grant cert in their pre-October Term 2024 orders list at the end of the Summer. The DC Circuit’s Licavoli decision should be reversed and the Supreme Court should use this occasion to reinforce that lower courts cannot empty the word “willfully” of all meaning.\n***",

    "text": "By Brendan O'Brien\n(Reuters) - Three Christian missionaries from Missions in Haiti were shot and killed in an ambush by a gang in Haiti, the Oklahoma-based group said on Friday.\nThe missionaries were taking shelter in a house when gang members began shooting at the residence at about 9 p.m. CDT (0200 GMT) Thursday, the group said in two Facebook (NASDAQ: META ) posts.\nMonths of gang violence in Haiti have forced the government into retreat, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned the country is close to becoming a failed state.\nHaiti’s main international airport in Port-au-Prince reopened this week, nearly three months after it shut due to deadly gang-related violence. But gangs still control much of the capital and Haiti's main seaport remains closed.\n\"Unfortunately, this serves as a reminder that the security situation in Haiti cannot wait – too many innocent lives are being lost,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.\nMissouri State Representative Ben Baker said his daughter Natalie Lloyd and son-in-law Davy Lloyd were killed while working as full-time missionaries. Davy Lloyd was the son of the organization's founders, David and Alicia Lloyd, who started it in 2000.\nThe identity of the third person killed has not been released.\n\"My heart is broken in a thousand pieces. I’ve never felt this kind of pain,\" Baker said on Facebook.\nMissions in Haiti said the couple was leaving a church when they were ambushed by three trucks full of gang members. They took Davy Lloyd to a house, tied him up and beat him, before taking the group's trucks and some items and left, it said.\n\"Another gang came after to see what was going on and if they could help, so they say,\" the organization said. \"No one understood what they were doing, not sure what took place but one was shot and killed and now this gang went into full attack mode.\"\nThe couple and another individual identified as Jude called a leader of the organization on a satellite phone and said that their lives were in danger.\nThree Christian missionaries from Oklahoma-based group killed in Haiti",

    "text": "A special Chof Daled Teves event will take place in Montreal, Canada to mark the Alter Rebbe’s Yartzeit and the Yartzeit of the the Mashpia and Kabbalist Reb Volf Greenglass OBM.\nRabbi Greenglass, a devoted Shliach of the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe and the Rebbe, was a beloved educator who merited to inculcate Chasidic values and Chabad Chasidus teachings to over 3 generations of students.\nIn his honor, the family and many of the Montreal institutions are organizing a beautiful event, with guest keynote speaker, Rabbi Shmuel Lew, Shliach in London, England.\nThe public is invited to watch this evening of chizuk prayer for Eretz Yisrael and inspiring farbrengen live on COLive.com and at REBVOLF.COM.\nLIVE\nThe book about Reb Volf Greenglass, containing many of Reb Volf’s farbrengen stories, Minhagim, and teachings, has recently been published in English.\nAfter many years of hard work, a team of dedicated editors translated the book of Rabbi Greenglass into English. This English translation will allow the English-speaking public to learn and savor the wisdom and dedication of this unique chassidishe personality of our generation.\nThe book can be pre-purchased online at REBVOLF.COM or at your local Hebrew book store in the near future.\nRabbi Menachem Zev Greenglass (halevi) was originally born to a non-Chabad family in the Polish town of Krasnik, near Lublin, and was sent to learn in the Chabad Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim in Lodge and Otwock where he acquired his vast knowledge in Torah, Kabbalah and Chassidus.\nAfter fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe to Shanghai, China, Rabbi Greenglass traveled from there to Montreal, Canada, as one of the 9 shluchim sent by the Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, to cultivate the Jewish community.\nTheir first achievement was establishing the Rabbinical College of Canada, also known as Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim. Thousands of students from nonobservant families got the taste and love for Judaism in the school. they became the many Torah observant grandparents of today’s frum community.\nRabbi Greenglass, or Reb Volf, was soon appointed as the Head Mashpia and spent many years teaching and inspiring thousands of Lubavitch students who went on to become shluchim, community leaders, and chassidishe yungeleit and professionals around the world.\nHe was known to say, “You should never ‘put down’ (criticize) a student, you should ‘elevate’ him, and show him his unlimited positive potentials.”\nTogether with his longtime friend Rabbi Leibel Groner obm, who served as the Rebbe’s secretary, he made the first attempt to document Chabad customs in the monumental book “Sefer Haminhagim.”\nIn Montreal, he was always referred to by members of the Jewish community as a Tzaddik and a Malach (a righteous man and an angel). The Rebbe once called him “my Mekubal (Kabbalist).”",

At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

Israeli bombs killed her sister and brother in Gaza, and maimed another sister. Bethlehem, occupied West Bank – At Christmas, Noha Helmi Tarazi normally decorates her home with a large tree, which she describes as a symbol of light and joy. The 87-year-old prepares the house for her family, who gather here each year, and makes Christmas sweets and large, festive meals. She usually places presents under the Christmas tree for her grandchildren, taking care to wrap them and label them with their names.

Even the children do not feel like celebrating, she says. “There is no joy left in our hearts,” she says. In the birthplace of Jesus Christ, the celebrations for Christmas are on hold. The [decision to cancel Christmas](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/22/without-work-and-hope-bethlehems-christmas-economy-bleeds-from-gaza-war) has not been taken lightly, but it is one the church and community here are all united on, to show their solidarity with the Palestinians facing Israeli bombardment and a total siege in the Gaza Strip. Israeli bombing and artillery fire have killed [more than 20,000 people](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker) in Gaza since the war began on October 7, including at least 8,000 children. More than 300 people have been killed in the occupied West Bank, too, either by Israeli soldiers or by settlers who often attack with cover from Israeli troops. The war has brought Bethlehem’s tourism – a bedrock of its economy – to a standstill at the time of the year when it usually peaks. Where visitors from around the world would usually throng Bethlehem’s markets around Christmas, the streets are empty this year. But even if tourists were around, there’s no festivity among the residents of Bethlehem, many of whom have close family members in Gaza. “How can we celebrate Christmas in the midst of this genocidal war?” asks Tarazi, known to those close to her as Um Shadi. “How can we celebrate when people in Gaza struggle to get even one meal a day?” The images and news of the suffering in Gaza under Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion are too much for her. Um Shadi, whose family lives in Gaza City, says she has been particularly disturbed by videos of people fleeing towards the sea and being forced to boil seawater to make it drinkable. She grew up in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City and lived there through her 20s during the 1960s. She has “beautiful memories of the sea”, where she used to swim at night. People lived in peace, she says. Life became harder after she graduated with a degree in English literature from Cairo University in 1967. She was unable to return to Gaza because it was occupied by Israel that year, and instead, she spent the next 10 years in Libya, where her brothers also lived and where she met her husband. She eventually returned to the occupied West Bank, where she made her home and built her Christmas rituals with her family – traditions she will skip this year. ‘This Christmas, may God have mercy on them’ All signs of Christmas have disappeared from the streets and homes of Bethlehem. Usually, people flock to [Manger Square](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/if-christ-were-born-today-he-would-be-born-under-rubble-israeli-bombing), which is adorned with decorations, to watch fireworks. None of that will happen this year. Lots of people in Bethlehem and the surrounding area have relatives in Gaza. Um Shadi herself has lost a brother and a sister since the war began. Her brother died on October 17 after being unable to receive a life-saving gallbladder operation because of the aerial bombardment of hospitals in the Strip. Just a few days later, one of her sisters died in an [air strike](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/10/20/we-were-baptised-here-and-we-will-die-here-gazas-oldest-church-bombed) on St Porphyrius Greek Orthodox Church, where the family had taken shelter. Another sister lost a leg during the same bombardment. It has always been difficult to see her family, even before the war, but now she can barely even speak to them because of the [telecommunications blackouts](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/21/led-by-plumes-of-smoke-how-gazas-first-responders-navigate-a-blackout#:~:text=On%20at%20least%20five%20occasions,defence%20teams%20amid%20heavy%20bombardment.) in Gaza. Um Shadi was unable to attend another sister’s funeral in the enclave before the war because she was not granted a permit to travel there. Instead, her niece had to take a video of the ceremony for her. In happier years, some Christians from Gaza had been able to obtain permits from the Israeli authorities to travel from Gaza to Bethlehem at Christmas – something her sisters and her friend Rose often did, she says. “My sisters used to visit me, and I say this year on Christmas, may God have mercy on them.” The agony of not being able to communicate with her family in Gaza is unbearable, she adds. It has brought her to “the brink of despair”. Christmas used to be the one joyful event that everyone could count on each year, Um Shadi says. Now, that has gone, too.",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death.\nFour models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S.\nHealth Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country.\nThe metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds.\nHealth Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada.\nIt says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund.\nThe recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ.\nNo information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S.\nDrive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued.\nMore than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nCanadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.
