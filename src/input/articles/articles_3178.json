    "text": "El Salvador's Bold Vision: Culture Ministry Layoffs and Controversial Reforms El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced the dismissal of 300 culture ministry employees for promoting conflicting agendas. Emphasizing cost-saving and alignment with government vision, Bukele aims to address the nation's issues with controversial policies. His tenure is marked by decisive actions, including security reforms and strict anti-abortion laws, drawing both support and criticism. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 28-06-2024 02:53 IST | Created: 28-06-2024 02:53 IST El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said on Thursday that the country's culture ministry is set to fire 300 employees who are promoting agendas that are \"incompatible\" with the government's vision. \"Furthermore, we will save public funds in the process,\" Bukele said on X. \"Bitter medicine.\" Bukele took office at the start of June for a second term after winning a landslide re-election, pledging to cure the \"illnesses\" of the Central American country by prescribing \"medicine \" to fix the economy, following what described as a cure for the \"cancer of the gangs\" during his first term. Bukele, a former marketing executive, garnered massive popularity for transforming security in a country that was once one of the world's most dangerous, but mass trials , a mega prison and suspended civil rights have drawn criticism from human rights groups. His popularity has been reinforced by a powerful media machine that includes teams of internet trolls who flood social networks with government propaganda. Since beginning his second term, Bukele has made several changes in his cabinet, including the appointment of Raul Castillo, a former teacher, as culture minister last week in order to \"promote patriotic and family values.\" The small Central American country maintains some of the world's harshest anti-abortion laws . \"El Salvador is pro-life, pro-traditional family and the 2030 agenda has no place here,\" ruling party lawmaker Alexia Rivas said on X, referring to the United Nation's development plan which includes provisions for a range of human rights. \"This is what the people asked for, this is the vision of our president, and this is the path that officials must follow,\" Rivas said. Earlier this month, the culture ministry canceled a play by drag artists after receiving complaints from local conservative and religious groups.

O aumento, que chega a 27% para algumas classes, será realizado de forma escalonada ao longo dos próximos três anos, nos meses de agosto de 2024, maio de 2025 e maio de 2026. As carreiras contempladas pelo acordo são: delegado da PF, perito criminal federal, agente da PF, escrivão da PF, papiloscopista da PF e policial rodoviário federal. Para cada uma dessas carreiras foram formalizados três acordos, devido às mudanças específicas para cada uma delas.\nOs valores acordados para os delegados e peritos variam de acordo com a classe, sendo R$ 27.831,70 (terceira classe), R$ 30.869,46 (segunda classe), R$ 35.377,35 (primeira classe) e R$ 41.350 (classe especial).

Os protestos por melhores salários já vinham ocorrendo desde o governo anterior. As entidades representativas das carreiras ameaçavam realizar greves para pressionar por reajustes salariais. Em outubro, foram realizadas mobilizações cobrando a reestruturação salarial das carreiras ao governo de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT). A negociação com os policiais penais ainda está em andamento. Já os servidores administrativos não foram contemplados.\nLeia também STF nega pedido para obrigatoriedade de câmeras corporais em policiais militares de SP Polícia Federal indicia empresário amigo de Renato Cariani por associação para tráfico de drogas",

    "text": "By Abraham Achirga\nABUJA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent's most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican's declaration will change much.\n\"Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,\" Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the\nimpression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope's decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God's children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n\"There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,\" said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n\"I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,\" she said.\n\"We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\"\n(Reporting by Abraham Achirga Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)\n(( ; Reuters Messaging:\n[macdonald.dzirutwe.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net](rm://macdonald.dzirutwe.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net/)))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",
