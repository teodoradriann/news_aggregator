    "text": "My 3-month-old son was diagnosed with retinoblastoma, an eye cancer, by turning on a white flash and checking his eyes. Entered 2024.02.29 22:05 Entered 2024.02.29 22:05 Modified 2024.02.29 18:00 Views 559\nThe story of a woman with four children in the UK who discovered a rare cancer in her newborn son through her mobile phone was told. This was thanks to the camera’s flash function. [사진=뉴욕포스트 보도 캡처]The story of a woman with four children in the UK was told that she discovered a rare cancer in her newborn son using a cell phone camera flash.\nAccording to recent reports, including the American daily New York Post, 40-year-old Sarah Hedges looked at her 3-month-old son Thomas while preparing dinner in November 2022 and noticed a ‘white light’ shining in his eyes.\nHedges noticed that her son’s eyes seemed to reflect light like a cat’s eyes, so she turned on the flash on her phone and took a picture. This was to check whether there was a problem due to the lighting. And the next day, when we moved Thomas to another room near the light, we saw that white light again.\nHedges searched for related information , and based on the information he found, he thought Thomas may have cancer. He later showed the doctor the photos he had taken. The doctor at the time didn’t seem too worried, but Hedges, who was worried as her mother, requested a test at the hospital.\nTest results showed that Thomas was, in fact, diagnosed with retinoblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of eye cancer. Thomas, who was diagnosed with a rare cancer, underwent six rounds of chemotherapy starting in November 2022. He also developed sepsis, but completed his last chemotherapy treatment on April 6, 2023, and was diagnosed as cured on May 10, 2023. He is said to be currently recovering well.\nRetinoblastoma: A subtle white glow appears in the eyes under certain lighting conditions.\nAccording to the Children’s Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT), signs of retinoblastoma include the appearance of a white light when exposed to certain lights or when the eye is squinted. In addition to light, symptoms such as changes in eye shape or eye swelling may also occur. However, it appears very subtly and difficult to notice. If there are no noticeable symptoms, it may be difficult to recognize them right away because babies often appear healthy.\nNevertheless, if symptoms are detected late or treatment is delayed, the eye may need to be removed in less than half of all cases. In the case of Thomas, the medical staff said it was fortunate that his mother was able to immediately identify the symptoms and receive treatment.\nAccording to the National Cancer Information Center’s cancer information , retinoblastoma is a primary malignant tumor that occurs in the optic nerve cells of the retina and occurs most often in children. It accounts for 3-4% of childhood cancer, especially malignant tumors, and is mainly discovered in infancy. It is reported that 5% of blindness in children is due to retinoblastoma.\nThe retina is the innermost membrane of the eye, and its role is to detect light, process and integrate visual information , and transmit it to the brain through the optic nerve. The biggest cause of why cancer occurs in the retina is genetics. Until now, no genes related to the development of retinoblastoma were known other than the MYCN gene. Among these, in January last year, a joint research team led by Seung-gyu Lee and Yong-jun Kim, professors in the Department of Ophthalmology at Yonsei University Severance Hospital, and Professor Han Jeong-woo in the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, identified that BRCA gene mutation is the cause of retinoblastoma.\nBRCA genetic mutations are associated with ovarian cancer and breast cancer. The research team explains that retinocytoma can occur when there is a BRCA gene mutation and epigenetic mutations caused by the external environment overlap. It was recently published in the international academic journal ‘British Journal of Ophthalmology.’\n“Copyright ⓒ ‘Honest Knowledge for Health ’ Comedy.com ( / Unauthorized reproduction and redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited”\n2024-02-29 13:06:07\n#white #light #childs #eyes.. #mother #discover #sons #cancer\nRelated posts: Paco Roca portrays a woman with breast cancer who receives a new therapy Orthopedics becomes a university, the first step towards the Medicine course. \"A milestone\" bacon?

    "text": "Red Bull No Contest Sails Into Sydney Harbour, Clocks The Heaviest Surf Breaks Within 30km Of The Coathanger Examining the rich surf community of the oldest + most densely populated city in Oz. Welcome back to No Contest — Stab and Red Bull’s travel show examining the culture, characters and customs of various surf communities around the globe. In episode one, No Contest host Ashton Goggans is joined by Red Bull athletes Molly Picklum and Jarvis Earle, and a bunch of legendary local surfers, photographers and designers, exploring Sydney’s variegated surf scene — from Cronulla, 26 kms south of the CBD, all the way up to Terrigal on the Central Coast, just beyond its limits. In coming weeks, we will be heading to Hawaii’s South Shore, Japan and Florida. Sydney, Australia’s oldest city, has a population exceeding 5.3 million, representing nearly 20% of the country’s total population. This makes finding decent, uncrowded waves a real challenge. To help navigate this, we sought advice from some of the surf community’s most respected figures: Eastern Suburbs photographer Bill Morris, World Junior Champion and waterman Grayson Hinrichs, Maroubra local Max McGuigan, and two-time World Champion Tom Carroll from the Northern Beaches. “Bondi was a hard town. It was pretty underground,” recalls Bill Morris of the “Scum Valley” days during the 1970s and 1980s — a time when Bondi had a reputation for being rough and gritty, with a proper underbelly and working-class demographic. “But by the 2000’s, all the movie stars and everyone rolled in, and prices boomed. Soon Bondi was the place to be.” 2019 ISA World Junior Champion Grayson Hinrichs by contrast, grew up in a Bondi swelling with real estate agents and lip filler. Thanks to the Eastern Suburbs’ proximity to the CBD, stunning beaches, and high quality of living, property prices have soared over 700% since the 90’s in many postcodes, making it one of the most sought after and expensive stretches of coastline in the world. “That’s the thing: you’ve got everything you need right on your doorstep,” says Grayson. Outside the water, we speak with Sam Coombes, Founder of The Critical Slide Society (TCSS) and Batlow Cider, on how Sydney has functioned an entrepreneurial and creative hub for some of the most recognisable brands in surf – such as Mambo, Deus, TCSS and Monster Children. Finally, Jarvis Earle and Max McGuigan wrap up the show speaking to the region’s several heavywater reefs such as Deadmans, Wedding Cake Island and Cape Solander, the latter of which became the site of one of the most spectacular slab contests in existence, Red Bull Cape Fear. “Growing up in Maroubra, it was just full of heavyhitters like Mark Mathews, Richie Vas, Koby Abberton, Wayne Cleveland and all them boys,” says Max, who is widely regarded as the region’s biggest goofyfoot warlord in waves of peril. “The boys pretty much pioneered waves that were unridden [on standups] and started making them as well.” Most Recent [ Oct 3, 2024 ](https://stabmag.com/premium/the-electric-acid-surfboard-test-starring-dave-rastovich-episode-one/) The Electric Acid Surfboard Test Starring Dave Rastovich, Episode 1 Our trip begins with a \"USB chip\", a \"Mullet\", an \"Experiment\", and \"Aladdin's slipper\" in Dave's enviable hometown surf.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "XRP News Today: XRP Analyst Hints Token \"About to Explode\" as 1000 XRP Holders Lead Market Outlook",
    "text": "XRP News Today: XRP Analyst Hints Token \"About to Explode\" as 1000 XRP Holders Lead Market Outlook\nA prominent crypto analyst, Armando Pantoja, has drawn renewed attention to XRP with a cryptic but bullish message, suggesting that the token is on the verge of a significant move. In a July 29, 2025, tweet, Pantoja revealed he had spoken with contacts in Washington, D.C., and hinted that XRP is “about to explode,” without disclosing specifics about the timing or nature of the potential event. He emphasized that investors with at least 1,000 XRP are already in a favorable position, sparking discussions among retail and institutional traders alike [1].\nAccording to data from the XRP Rich List, nearly 6 million of the 6.8 million XRP wallets hold fewer than 1,000 tokens. This means that individuals with at least that amount are in the top 10% of wallet holders. Pantoja’s remarks, therefore, suggest that those with 1,000 or more XRP are well-positioned ahead of potential market developments [1]. Analysts have also noted that an amount as small as 3,300 XRP—currently valued at around $9,900—could place an investor among the top-tier holders of the token [1].\nThe lack of concrete details from Pantoja has led to speculation about what might trigger the “Big Move.” Some market participants believe the news could be related to regulatory developments in the U.S., while others point to the potential for institutional investment or major ecosystem upgrades. At the current price of $3.14 per XRP, a 1,000-token stack is valued at approximately $3,140. If Pantoja’s prediction proves accurate, early adopters could see substantial returns in the short to medium term [1].\nPrice forecasts for XRP vary widely. Some analysts, like Jake Claver of Digital Ascension Group, have suggested that the token could rise to $1,000 per unit as early as next year, potentially generating significant passive income for larger holders. For example, 6,000 XRP at $1,000 would yield $6 million in value, with annual returns sufficient to fund a comfortable lifestyle in many parts of the U.S. [1]. However, more cautious observers advocate for higher targets of 40,000 to 50,000 XRP, currently valued at over $150,000, and more moderate price goals. These divergent forecasts reflect the broader community’s mix of optimism and caution [1].\nThe timing of Pantoja’s comments coincides with a mixed broader market environment. While crypto sentiment appears to be improving, traditional financial institutions and media remain divided. For instance, Motley Fool Stock Advisor has not included XRP among its top 10 recommended stocks for 2025, highlighting the speculative nature of the asset in the eyes of some financial experts [4]. This contrast underscores the need for investors to carefully evaluate their risk tolerance and investment strategy before acting on bullish signals.\nIn the absence of concrete information, investors are urged to remain informed and prepared. Pantoja’s hint—while encouraging—does not provide a clear roadmap. Those holding 1,000 XRP or more should consider revisiting their portfolio strategies and setting realistic expectations. Whether the anticipated move materializes or not, the current market conditions suggest that XRP continues to attract attention as a key player in the crypto space [1].\nSource:\n[1] title: Don't Blink: 1000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You've ...

    "text": "- The Gaza negotiations encounter complications due to the ongoing Israel-Egypt disagreement. As diplomatic efforts to ceasefire in the Gaza Strip persist, UN officials are urging heightened attempts to administer urgent polio vaccinations to hundreds of thousands of children in the conflict-ridden region. Baxter, the emergency health unit head at Save the Children, stated at a UN Security Council meeting in New York, \"If precautionary measures aren't implemented swiftly, the polio outbreak won't just be a disaster for Gaza's children, but it could severely hinder worldwide efforts to wipe out the disease.\" The coming month will witness a vaccination campaign backed by numerous nations requesting a ceasefire in Gaza. Polio outbreaks have been confirmed within the strip, and its isolated coastal border will not deter the spread of the disease, as mentioned by Baxter. Since the commencement of the war, approximately 50,000 children have been born and lack the necessary vaccinations. \"The decimated healthcare infrastructure is utterly incapable of dealing with this new polio emergency,\" noted Baxter. Polio is a highly contagious, infectious disease that can lead to permanent paralysis and even death, particularly among young children. It is usually transmitted through contaminated water, and there is no known cure for it. Still Engaging in Ceasefire Discussions An Israeli negotiating squad is currently holding discussions in Cairo over a potential ceasefire agreement, as per an Israeli government spokesperson. In addition, a delegation hailing from the USA has arrived at Cairo airport to engage in further talks, according to reliable sources. The Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" cited an Israeli representative, stating that the negotiating team is preparing for a potential summit on Sunday \"if Hamas shows signs of recognition.\" Egypt, Qatar, and the USA are facilitating dialogue between Israel and Hamas, as they do not engage directly with each other. Report on New Israeli Proposals The accord will include the liberation of Israeli hostages held by the Islamic Hamas and the release of Palestinian detainees from Israeli prisons. However, Israel's enduring demand for permanent control of the southern border between Gaza and Egypt is one of the significant points of contention. According to the Israeli military, numerous Hamas tunnels exist beneath the so-called Philadelphi Corridor, which Israel requests control of in order to prevent weapon smuggling. Egypt vehemently denies the presence of such smuggling networks. Israeli General Israel Ziv, in an interview with the \"Wall Street Journal,\" commented, \"There is an intense distrust between Israel and Egypt.\" The U.S. newspaper reported, citing Egyptian sources, on new Israeli proposals. Per these reports, Israel's negotiating team has proposed constructing eight observation towers within the corridor. The USA has presented an alternative proposal of building just two towers. However, Egypt rejects both proposals, arguing that such towers would give Israel's military continuous access to the area. Netanyahu Reinforces Demands Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office disputed an afternoon news report suggesting that a multinational force may be stationed along the Philadelphi Corridor. According to the Qatari news website Al-Araby al-Jadid, such stationing was considered. Netanyahu continues to advocate for preserving control of the Philadelphi Corridor to prevent Hamas' rearmament, as per his office's statement. This would forestall Hamas from repeating the deaths and kidnappings that occurred on October 7, 2023, when Hamas and other terrorist groups killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and captured over 250 hostages in Gaza, sparking the conflict. Hamas accuses Israel of obstructing negotiations on a settlement by refusing to vacate the approximately 14-kilometer-long Philadelphi Corridor. The extremists demand a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. According to Egyptian officials cited by the \"Wall Street Journal,\" Israeli military presence in the corridor violates the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which prohibits tank, artillery, and anti-aircraft weapon deployment there. Concerns Over Negotiations' Failure Egypt does not wish to be perceived as underwriting Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip, according to reports. However, Israel denies violating the treaty and insists on maintaining its military presence in the corridor, citing a lack of trust in Egypt's effectiveness in preventing Hamas' weapon smuggling, as per the US newspaper. Daniel Kurtzer, a former United States ambassador to Egypt and Israel, mused, \"Perhaps Egypt and Israel will eventually find a resolution, but I'm unsure if there is a solution for Hamas' demands.\" As per a recent report by the US news site \"Politico,\" citing two Israeli and two American officials, the agreement appears to be in jeopardy, with no obvious alternative. In the event of failure, a major escalation in the Middle East is expected. After the killings of two high-ranking Israeli adversaries in Iran's capital Tehran and the Lebanese capital Beirut nearly three weeks ago, Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia threatened violent retribution. The United Nations Security Council expressed concern over the potential impact of the ongoing conflict in Gaza on the global polio eradication efforts, during a meeting headed by Baxter from Save the Children. If a ceasefire isn't reached and the situation deteriorates, the council members urged for immediate action to prevent the spread of polio beyond the Gaza Strip.",

    "text": "2024 dijo adiós con, al menos, media docena de cierres de esos que quedan en la memoria y que deterioran la oferta gastronómica de la ciudad. Pero 2025 viene pisando fuerte. Parece que hay luz al final del túnel.\nAcabamos de cruzar la línea que divide lo antiguo de lo nuevo y no podemos mirar hacia delante sin volver la vista hacia atrás. El año que acaba de evaporarse nos deja un puñado de restaurantes que se han convertido en historia porque fueron parte de momentos que han sido importantes. El año comenzó con el cierre de Vertical, el restaurante regentado por la familia Andrés Salvador, que durante 18 años deslumbró a la ciudad desde las alturas. Unos meses más tarde, cuando arrancaba julio, cerraban bodega La Aldeana y su hermano Malarmat, dejando esa parte del Cabanyal todavía no copada por el turismo, un poco coja. La misma semana Omar Seid anunciaba que cerraba Bekaa, el mejor restaurante de comida libanesa que ha tenido la ciudad, por una buena causa: \"quiero vivir\", explicaba Omar en su carta de despedida. Dalima, el peruano que regeneró una Gran Vía Marqués del Turia cada vez con más franquicias, se fue de vacaciones el 30 de julio y nunca más volvió. No sabe Javier Calduch lo que echamos de menos sus piscos y sus ceviches. Cruzando esa Gran Vía estaba A Contracorriente, el restaurante que se hizo famoso por los gazpachos que preparaba la Mari, pero a final de septiembre, Pedro y Álex dieron por finalizado el trayecto. El último cierre del año nos ha dado una pena infinita. Hikari Yakitori bar, el hermano pequeño de Nozomi, la preciosa izakaya que nos enseñó que no solo de sushi vive Japón, anunciaba su cierre el 30 de diciembre. Sabemos que es ley de vida y que los proyectos nacen, crecen, y después de darnos muchas alegrías, algunos mueren, y no por ello nos acostumbramos. A los que se han ido solo nos queda agradecerles por tantos buenos momentos.\nPero la vida sigue. Y en los últimos meses, o semanas, hemos asistido a aperturas que habrá que seguirles la pista de cerca. Una de ellas es Noble, el restaurante ubicado en lo que fue Señuelo, que cambia por completo de tercio y bajo la batuta de José Cifre y Ángel García (es dacostianos), apuesta por recuperar recetas de antes con ciertas licencias. Abrió Borgia Wine Bar en plena calle Cavalleros, plantando cara a aquellos que creen –todos lo hemos dicho en algún momento–, que en El Carmen ya no se puede comer bien. Buena propuesta de vinos, espacio confortable y una carta diferente a cargo de los Two Many Chefs (pronto hablaremos con más tranquilidad de este bar). Solo unos metros más allá, en perpendicular, abrió, Casa D'Aragona robándonos el corazón. ¿Puede que la ciudad haya encontrado un sucesor legítimo a la Trattoria de Carlo? Vayan, prueben sus pizzas, y opinen. Ultramarinos Huerta abrió sucursal en Mercader: a los platos que ya amamos de la casa madre se le suma una acogedora sala para que quienes viven cerca del mar lo tengan más fácil. Continuamos en El Cabanyal con dos aperturas que están dando mucho que hablar: una es Cocleque (al frente de los fogones, Adrián, ex cocinero de El Astrónomo); la otra, Xaruga, con una mujer (lagrimita) al mando: Amparo Nacher. Ambos han llegado pisando fuerte. Sin moverse de El Cabanyal, aunque algo escondido, está Clementina, un mexicano de los que tratan de mostrar otra cara de la cocina mexicana. En Cánovas abrió a en octubre Informal, el segundo local de Xavi Climent, producto de primera, mucho pescado y marisco y vinazo en plena plaza de Cánovas.\nY dos aperturas recientes, recientísimas, que ya llevábamos tiempo siguiéndoles la pista: una es Hiro, el restaurante japonés donde se fusiona la delicadeza y experiencia de Andrés Pereda con la cocina nipona con el producto y la calidad de José Tomás. Ayer, jueves 2 de enero, abrió sus puertas al público. El mismo día que Maestro bar, un local en Maestro Gozalbo, en esa esquina que es una de las mejores ubicaciones del Ensanche. Detrás de este local, encontramos algunos personas que en el pasado estuvieron vinculadas a Sastrería, y que saben de qué va esto. Vino, aperitivos, platillos para compartir con producto de calidad y horario ininterrumpido para comer a deshoras o alargar la sobremesa. Larga vida a los bares que nunca cierran.\n¿Y qué va a pasar en los próximos meses gastronómicamente hablando? Tenemos una bomba que aún no podemos desvelar, pero que es un notición para un barrio que mira al mar y una ciudad que le da la espalda, sobre todo a la hora de comer. Qué ganas de contarlo...\nDesde Jávea llegará a Cánovas a mediados de febrero, Escama, un bar de tapas mediterráneas con arroces y el mar muy presente. Además, sin desvelar demasiados detalles, el Grupo Gastroadictos ataca de nuevo y confirma a Guía Hedonista que en la primera mitad del año llegarán al corazón de la ciudad con una propuesta algo diferente al resto de sus locales… Y hasta ahí nos dejan leer.",

    "title": "HUK Coburg: Private E-Autokäufe legen stark zu, 31.07.2025 | comdirect Informer",
    "text": "COBURG (dpa-AFX) - Nach langer Flaute kommt der private Elektroauto-Markt in Deutschland wieder in Schwung. Im zweiten Quartal sind laut \"E-Barometer\" des Versicherers HUK Coburg so viele private Autobesitzer auf einen vollelektrischen Wagen umgestiegen wie seit der Streichung der staatlichen Kaufprämie Ende 2023 nicht mehr.\nDemnach entschieden sich zwischen Anfang April und Ende Juni im statistischen Schnitt 5,5 Prozent der privaten Besitzer bei der Anschaffung eines anderen Wagens für ein batteriebetriebenes Auto. Das war gut ein Drittel mehr als in den ersten drei Monaten des Jahres (4,1 Prozent), wie das Unternehmen mitteilte. Fahrzeuge mit Hybridmotoren sind in der Auswertung nicht mitgezählt.\nFirmen- und Dienstautos außen vor\nDie alte Bundesregierung hatte den Elektroauto-Zuschuss im Dezember 2023 gestrichen, danach war die Umstiegsquote von 6,2 auf unter 4 Prozent gesunken. Die Auswertung beruht auf den unternehmenseigenen Daten, die HUK ist mit gut 14 Millionen Fahrzeugen Marktführer der Kfz-Versicherung in Deutschland vor der Allianz.\nAnders als das Kraftfahrtbundesamt (KBA) in seinen Zulassungsstatistiken wertet die HUK für ihr \"E-Barometer\" ausschließlich die Anmeldungen privater Autobesitzer aus, und zwar sowohl gebrauchter als auch neuer Fahrzeuge. Firmen- und Dienstautos sind ebenso wenig berücksichtigt wie die Fahrzeugflotten der Autovermieter.\nDas Unternehmen will damit Aufschluss über die Präferenzen der Autobesitzerinnen und Autobesitzer gewinnen. \"Ob der Umstieg zur E-Mobilität in Deutschland gelingt, entscheidet sich im privaten Automarkt, denn er umfasst gut 90 Prozent des Gesamtmarktes\", sagte Vorstandsmitglied Jörg Rheinländer.\nVorbehalte gegen Elektroautos werden schwächer\nAuch die begleitenden Umfragen deuten darauf, dass die verbreitete Elektroauto-Skepsis in der Bevölkerung schwächer wird. In der aktuellen Version bewertete erstmals eine relative Mehrheit von 48 Prozent E-Autos mit \"sehr gut\" oder \"gut\", 45 Prozent hingegen halten Batterieautos nach wie vor für weniger oder gar nicht gut. Anfang 2024 waren die Befürworter noch mit 37 Prozent in der Minderheit gewesen. Das Umfrageinstitut Yougov befragte im HUK-Auftrag vom 12. Mai bis 1. Juni 4.180 Menschen ab 16.\nDie Vorlieben aber unterscheiden sich stark nach Alter, Geschlecht und Bundesland: In der Altersgruppe ab 40 sind im bundesweiten Schnitt nur 39 Prozent E-Auto-Befürworter, unter den Jüngeren von 16 bis 39 hingegen sind es knapp zwei Drittel (65 Prozent).\nFrauen sind demnach skeptischer als Männer. Letztere halten batteriebetriebene Autos zu 55 Prozent für eine gute Sache, bei den Frauen sind es nur 41 Prozent. Am höchsten sind die Anteile der E-Auto-Besitzer in Bayern (3,7 Prozent) und Niedersachsen (3,6), in Sachsen (1,7 Prozent) am niedrigsten./cho/DP/zb",
