    "title": "British PM Keir Starmer refuses to meet Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus - BusinessToday",
    "text": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer refused to meet Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who is in London seeking UK support to recover billions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by the former Sheikh Hasina regime, Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\"I have no direct conversation with him,” Yunus told the Financial Times. While expressing confidence in UK cooperation, he added, “I have no doubt he would support us. This is stolen money.”\nUK government officials confirmed there were no plans for Starmer to meet Yunus during his four-day visit.\nYunus, a Nobel laureate and current head of Bangladesh's interim government, said the UK had a “legal and… moral” obligation to help track funds allegedly laundered into the country. “The objective of the trip is to bring out more enthusiastic support,” he said, noting that UK authorities were already providing some assistance.\nYunus has been at the helm since August 2024, when Sheikh Hasina was ousted following a large-scale student protest movement. The former prime minister is now facing multiple legal cases.\nThe Hasina-era investigations have raised political ripples in the UK too. In January, Tulip Siddiq — then anti-corruption minister and a close ally of Starmer — resigned after being named in corruption allegations involving support from Awami League-linked figures. Siddiq, who is Sheikh Hasina's niece, denied wrongdoing but stepped down from her ministerial post.\nShe has since written to Yunus, asking to meet and “clear up the misunderstanding” surrounding the accusations. But Yunus declined, saying: “This is a legal issue… a legal process. It’s not personal involving me.”\nMeanwhile, Yunus said the interim government wants stable ties with India but added something goes wrong every time because of all the fake news. Speaking at a public event hosted by Chatham House on Wednesday, Yunus said: \"We want to build the best of relationship with India. It’s our neighbour, we don’t want to have any kind of basic problem with them,” he said. “But somehow things go wrong every time because of all the fake news coming from the Indian press… and many people say it has connections with policymakers on the top.”\n\"This is what makes Bangladesh very jittery, very, very angry. We try to get over this anger but a whole barrage of things keeps happening in cyberspace. We can’t just get away from that...suddenly they say something, do something, anger comes back. This is our big task, to make sure we can have at least a peaceful life to go on with our life. To create the life we are dreaming of.\"\nYunus also addressed Hasina’s presence in India. “All the anger (against Hasina) has now transferred to India because she went there,” he said. Recalling a conversation with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Yunus said: \"I simply said: you want to host her, I cannot force you to abandon that policy. But please help us in making sure she doesn’t speak to Bangladeshi people the way she is doing (online). She announces on such and such date, such and such hour, she will speak and the whole (of) Bangladesh gets very angry.\"\nYunus added: “It’s (an) explosive situation, you can’t just walk away by saying it’s the social media.” He reiterated that national elections would be held by the first half of 2026 and clarified he had no intention of participating in an elected government. “No way,” he said.",

    "text": "WWE Hall of Famer can face John Cena in his retirement match.\n2025 is set to host two big retirement matches already. While John Cena has already begun his retirement tour, and is scheduled to face Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41, another Hall of Famer is also set to have his retirement match.\nFormer Universal Champion Goldberg is reported to have his retirement match later this year in 2025, although an exact date is not known yet. Goldberg also recently underwent stem cell therapy and is set to resume his training in the next few weeks.\nSpeaking to Ariel Helwani on The Ariel Helwani Show, he opened up on his list of potential retirement opponents. Naming John Cena as a possible foe, the Hall of Famer commented:\n“I never got a chance to get my hand around Cena’s throat. That might have been cool. There are a lot of people I would have loved to have faced back in the day, but the fact is, what does that do for the business now? A lot of people don’t even remember me that watch wrestling right now. A lot of people don’t know me because they speak negatively of me. I think I was an innovator of sorts. There are a plethora (of people).\nI’d love to have a rematch with Roman [Reigns]. There are so many guys that are so talented and on the cusp of stardom if not there yet, that are possibilities. Bron Breakker. It’s a logical solution. It’s all in how the powers that be want to make it happen. We’ll figure it out and hopefully, at the end of the day, I’m able to present myself in a positive manner to where the people of today, who don’t remember me, will sure as frick remember me after they see me my last time, and it won’t be in a negative way.”\nH/t Fightful\nWith The Leader of Cenation fixated on Rhodes, Goldberg recently found himself at the receiving end of some verbal shots by Matt Riddle.\nJohn Cena Has Addressed The Crowd Following His WWE Heel Turn\nAbsent since Elimination Chamber 2025, John Cena appeared on the March 17th episode of Raw in Brussels, Belgium, and addressed the crowd for the first time since his heel turn. Cena stated that his character change stemmed from the audience’s reactions, alleging that he has been the butt of an invisible joke for nearly fifteen years and had been bullied by the crowd into embracing that character. He further emphasized that he is not a heel, but a human being, to whom the fans have been awful.\nIn other news: A WWE star wants a budding AEW star to beat Mercedes Mone.",

    "title": "GM Thinks Super Cruise Will Generate $2 Billion Per Year",
    "text": "Automakers have been redefining themselves as tech firms, with brands debuting cars at events like CES over traditional affairs like the Detroit Auto Show. That should not be too surprising. Producing vehicle hardware is costly and complicated and generates little profit with a single purchase. Introducing software requires comparatively little profit and can be a consistent source of revenue — especially if you get buyers hooked on subscription plans they forget about.\nGeneral Motors has been bullish about promoting Super Cruise, its Level 2 hands-free driving technology. GM CEO Mary Barra told Automotive News that the brand expects Super Cruise to earn $2 billion in revenue annually within five years.\nRelated\nWhy GM's Super Cruise Is The Best Autonomous Tech I've Tested In My Career\nAfter testing every carmaker's autonomous driving technology, I can safely say that GM Super Cruise is by far the best there is.\nGM Expects a Lot More People to Use Super Cruise\nSuper Cruise began as a niche product on high-end Cadillac trims. However, the technology has now proliferated throughout the company's brand portfolio, particularly with EVs. GM estimates that the number of Super Cruise-equipped vehicles on the road will jump from around 360,000 to 720,000 by year's end.\nGM noted a 20 percent conversion to subscription rate after 18,000 owners had their three-year trials expire. The brand expects that percentage to increase as the pool widens to pickup drivers taking advantage of Super Cruise working while towing. Even if the rate remains static, a few thousand subscribers in 2025 could easily become a few hundred thousand by 2030.\nSuper Cruise Is the Best Level 2 Autonomous Driving System\nNearly every automaker has debuted some form of an automated highway driving system. But GM's Super Cruise, which we've tested in multiple vehicles, performs the best. Super Cruise is legitimately hands-free. It works consistently, smoothly and intuitively — while towing and in heavy traffic.\nSuper Cruise may lack some functionality, like Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving operation off highways. However, GM ensures that when it implements a feature, it works. Even the most skeptical and cantankerous car journalists will sing Super Cruise's praises and use it in real life with their families in tow.\nTopSpeed's Take\nCar buyers instinctively dislike and distrust in-car subscription plans. BMW, notably, has sparked backlashes by charging for relatively mundane features like heated seats and access to Apple Carplay, which owners could previously access for free. But Super Cruise may be a better use of subscription plans.\nSuper Cruise provides a premium service for the expenditure. So, it feels less like BMW nickel-and-diming after an owner dropped $80,000-plus on an X5 crossover. And buyers — if they think a bit harder about it — may appreciate the flexibility. Most buyers won't hold onto their vehicles for 10 years. So, paying a $250 per year subscription plan may save money over buying Super Cruise up front. And the owner who uses Super Cruise on one road trip per year should appreciate being able to sign up for one month for $25.",
