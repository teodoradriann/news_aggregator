    "text": "Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Friday welcomed Delhi University's (DU) decision to reject the proposal to include ‘Manusmriti’ in its law syllabus, with the senior politician saying that there was ‘strong opposition’ to the proposal.Also Read: RSS holds rallies in Tamil Nadu towns, Dalit outfit distributes Manusmriti in protest“Strong opposition to the proposal to teach Manusmriti in the Law Department of Delhi University, which goes against the honour and dignity of the Indian Constitution and its egalitarian and welfare objectives, is natural, and the decision to cancel this proposal is a welcome step,” she posted on X (formerly Twitter).The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister further stated that Manusmriti was not in line with principles on which the Constitution was drafted by the committee headed by Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar.Also Read: Karnataka govt Pythagoras theorem ‘fake news’, proposes to teach Manusmriti under NEP“His Holiness Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambdekar composed the universally accepted Indian Constitution, especially keeping the self-respect of the neglected people and women as well as humanism and secularism at the core, which does not match with Manusmriti at all. Therefore, any such attempt is not appropriate at all,” Mayawati wrote on the microblogging platform.Delhi University on ManusmritiOn Thursday, DU Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Singh clarified that its LLB students will not have to study the manuscript as suggestions to include it in the syllabus ‘have been rejected.’\\\"Today a proposal by the Faculty of Law was submitted to the Delhi University. In the proposal, they had suggested changes in the paper titled Jurisprudence. One of the changes was to include readings on Manusmriti. We have rejected both the suggested readings and the amendments proposed by the Faculty. Nothing of this sort will be taught to students,\\\" said Singh in a video message shared by the varsity.(With ANI inputs)",

Test HERE\nFingerprinting is about more than just the browser you use or cookies you allow. It is also stuff like the pixel dimensions of your browser window. That info is available to websites so they can display their website correctly. If you have a more rare computer monitor in terms of pixel ratio or pixel count that automatically narrows down your fingerprint. The browser add-ons you are using are also easy to know, so the more browser add-ons or extensions you are using the more uniquely identifiable your computer becomes. In many ways, using more obscure browsers, more specialized add-ons for security, etc. actually makes your computer more unique because there just aren't many people using those things.\nYou need to think more like you would if you wanted to be anonymous out in public. To become as invisible as possible, drive one of the most common vehicles made, in one of the most common colors sold, have zero unique identifying parts added to the outside, and drive with the flow of traffic everywhere you go. If you instead drive a rare car in a strange color with bumper stickers all over it you will be obvious wherever you go.\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 83745013\nUnited States\n06/24/2022 03:31 AM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Are You Being Tracked via Browser Fingerprint?

    "title": "\"El meu humil parer és que l’Església catòlica s’hauria de desmantellar\"",
    "text": "Sebastian Barry \"El meu humil parer és que l’Església catòlica s’hauria de desmantellar\" El celebrat autor irlandès publica ‘Temps immemorials’, sobre les conseqüències psicològiques de les víctimes dels abusos sexuals de l’Església del seu país. Ho fa a través de la història d’un policia acabatde jubilar a qui, quan comença a disfrutar de la seva nova vida a l’annex d’un castell victorià amb vistes al mar, li reapareix un cas de dècades enrere que no havia arribat a superar mai del tot. Sebastian Barry (Dublín, 1955), un dels autors més respectats de les lletres irlandeses, sol treballar en una vella rectoria del comtat de Wicklow on algun pastor protestant va escriure els seus sermons en el passat. L’habitació és petita i desprèn calidesa, pel que s’entreveu a través de la imatge de l’ordinador. Fa uns anys, la seva magnífica novel·la Días sin final, que segurament es convertirà en una pel·lícula, va ser finalista del Booker (té dues nominacions més) i el va donar a conèixer a les nostres llibreries. Temps immemorials (Proa), el seu últim treball, explora l’empremta deixada pels abusos comesos en les institucions irlandeses per l’Església catòlica. Ho fa des de la perspectiva crítica de l’autor, un catòlic que es va casar, segons les seves paraules, amb una \"noia protestant\", l’actriu Allison Deegan. ¿Per què ha volgut escriure una història tan trista com aquesta? Fa 61 anys jo tenia sis o set anys i amb la meva mare ens vam traslladar a viure al castell on transcorre la novel·la. Els meus pares acabaven de separar-se i jo i la meva germana solíem veure un home mirant a l’infinit davant el mar. Vaig imaginar llavors que era l’home més feliç d’aquest món i això em va permetre escriure aquesta història dura i trista sobre algú que ha patit abusos sexuals en el passat. En l’haver de la crònica més negra d’Irlanda es poden col·locar les velles accions de l’IRA però també la pederàstia per part de l’Església. ¿Què el va impulsar a escriure sobre això? De petits a Irlanda rebíem l’ordre de no parlar en absolut dels abusos infantils. A la meva família hi va haver un cas terrorífic i solien dir-nos que calléssim. Em recorda quan a La casa de Bernarda Alba es cridava \"silenci\". Afortunadament, la meva professió m’ha permès posar veu a aquesta prohibició i el personatge de Thomas Kettle, un policia acabat de jubilar que recorda un passat d’abusos, m’ha permès una espècie d’alliberament a la irlandesa. El llibre no tracta tant dels abusos comesos com de les seves conseqüències. Sí, és la història d’un supervivent que ha tingut una vida complexa. Un dels meus avis es dedicava al paisatgisme i a mi m’agrada dir que em dedico al paisatgisme de la ment. El Tom estima el món, però a les persones que estimen el món també els passen coses horribles. ¿Creu que l’Església catòlica irlandesa ha fet tot el que havia de fer en relació amb les víctimes? A la meva família, que era de classe mitjana alta, tenim un bisbe i unes quantes monges i capellans, però jo, segons el meu humil parer, crec que l’Església catòlica s’hauria de desmantellar. En el cas d’Irlanda, no han volgut fer reparacions econòmiques a les víctimes, una situació terrible, ja que el nombre de delinqüents religiosos és altíssim. I no es tracta que hi hagi dos o tres pomes podrides al barril, és que un terç d’aquest està fet malbé i, a més, podreix la resta. Si encara hi hagués nens en perill, i jo crec que n’hi ha, m’agradaria crear certa alarma amb aquesta novel·la, fer que la gent estigui més atenta al perill. ¿Sent que ara es pot parlar d’això al seu país amb una llibertat més gran? Actualment, els capellans no tenen el poder que tenien en el passat, ja no et poden dir com t’has de comportar o què has de pensar. Dos dels meus fills són gais i quan afirmen que ser gai no és pecat, però sí les pràctiques homosexuals, m’enervo. Hauria d’estar prohibit per llei que l’Església expressés les seves idees sobre la sexualitat de la gent perquè l’únic que provoquen és fer mal. ¿Com ha sigut acollida la novel·la al seu país? He rebut moltes crítiques positives. Bernard Shaw deia que la maldat prolifera quan la gent no fa res. Fa 30 o 40 si se m’hagués acudit escriure una novel·la sobre això, els meus veïns m’haurien negat la salutació. Avui Irlanda és un país millor i per això l’estimo. A més, no soc en absolut un pioner. El que estic rebent és el resultat de la valentia d’altres, com Sinéad O’Connor, que per desafiar el Papa la van ridiculitzar als 90. Vaig tenir la sort de ser el seu veí durant dos anys. Vostè sol utilitzar els membres de la seva família, sovint inventant-los històries, com a personatges de les seves novel·les. Aquí la seva pròpia experiència de nen víctima d’una separació és contemplada des de lluny pel protagonista. Intento veure totes les coses horribles que ens passen amb cert tipus de clemència. Durant molt temps he intentat escriure la història dels meus pares, la matemàtica més complicada que podia donar-se, però només ho he pogut fer a través del Tom. No ho he pogut fer directament.Notícies relacionades ¿Ha volgut dir que el seu pare també va ser un abusador? No exactament. La veritat és que no el freqüentava. Va morir l’any passat i feia una dècada que no el veia. L’únic que demostrava cap als seus fills era indiferència. Crec que no l’he arribat a entendre mai. Soc el seu fill, però en certa manera és com si ell no hagués sigut el meu pare. Jo tinc quatre fills i per mi un pare és aquella persona a qui vas a demanar consell –sí, admeto que soc una mica sentimental– però el meu pare hauria sigut l’última persona a qui hauria acudit. La pregunta que has fet només la podria respondre ell i m’alegro molt de no ser jo qui la respongui. - [Seguretat](https://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/societat/20231228/policia-nacional-ensena-polsar-movil-emergencia-112-dv-92660327) [La Policia Nacional ensenya què marcar al teu mòbil per trucar a emergències sense que el teu agressor se n’adoni](https://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/societat/20231228/policia-nacional-ensena-polsar-movil-emergencia-112-dv-92660327) - [La macrocausa dels Casuals, en escac per dubtes legals](https://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/societat/20231229/macrocausa-dels-casuals-escac-per-96348263) - [La targeta ‘T-drogues’ aixeca polseguera a les xarxes socials](https://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/societat/20231229/targeta-t-drogues-aixeca-polseguera-96348271) - [Els comiats d’any més sibarites](https://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/barcelona/20231228/els-comiats-d-any-mes-96314001) - [El Barça de Grimau es dessagna](https://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/esports/20231229/barca-grimau-dessagna-96348797)",
