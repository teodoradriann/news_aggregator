    "title": "Tren de Aragua gang member was in ICE custody and set free before viral Aurora vid — despite deportation order",
    "text": "By Jennie Taer ,\n2 hours ago\nA Tren de Aragua gang member was under a deportation order when he and five pals were allegedly caught on video storming an apartment building in Aurora, Colorado last month, according to ICE.\nICE had Niefred Serpa-Acosta, 20, in custody following two arrests for theft — but released him on July 17, despite the fact that a judge ruled he should be removed from the country, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told The Post.\nThe illegal Venezuelan migrant had also admitted that he was a member of the violent Venezuelan criminal organization — and had the tattoos to prove it, law enforcement sources previously told The Post.\nIt’s not clear why Serpa-Acosta was not removed from the US, but the Biden-Harris administration is not deporting Venezuelan migrants because Venezuela’s communist regime doesn’t except deportation flights.\nHe remains on the lam.\nEric Adams becomes first sitting NYC mayor indicted in historic federal probe — claims feds persecuting him over migrant crisis\nOne month after he was allowed to go free, the admitted Tren de Aragua gangbanger was caught on video storming an apartment building with five other men — one armed with a rifle — and forcing their way into a unit.\nThe footage went viral and turned the Denver suburb into the nation’s leading example of how sanctuary city crime and gang problems related to the influx of migrants are flowing into the suburbs.\nAurora cops have identified two other suspects as Anderson Zambrano-Pacheco, 25, and Naudi Lopez Fernandez, 21, both of whom crossed the border illegally last year and were released by federal authorities into the US, according to sources.\nThe two had lengthy rap sheets in Colorado, but there has yet to be any evidence of their affiliation with Tren de Aragua.\nAn armed crew flaunts guns inside a Colorado apartment building overrun by the Venezuelan gang. Edward Romero Aurora cops said on Wednesday they also identified the remaining three suspects involved in the incident, but have yet to release their identities.\nSanctuary city disaster could end under Trump — but will worsen if Harris wins\nAn ICE spokesperson told The Post that the agency issued a detainer for Serpa-Acosta with the Larimer County Jail in Fort Collins on April 24, which was holding him on theft charges. However, the jail released him without telling ICE.\nHe was later arrested again for theft, resisting arrest and obstructing an officer, and ICE again issued a detainer with the Douglas County Jail May 16. This time, ICE was able to scoop him up the next day.\nAcosta crossed the border illegally into El Paso, Texas, in December 2022, then volunteered to leave and turned back to Mexico, according to sources. However, ICE said he was not removed, and he was actually “released on his own recognizance.”\nIt’s not clear why he was allowed into the country.\nSerpa-Acosta and five other men were in the late August surveillance footage taken at an Aurora apartment complex that was overrun by the violent Venezuelan prison gang as they broke into a unit.\nJust 10 minutes after the incident took place, the group was allegedly involved in a fatal shooting, according to CBS Denver.\nThe viral video of gun-toting men breaking into an Aurora, Colorado, apartment complex made the Denver suburb a by-word for the spread of migrant crime. Edward Romero CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\nAurora police Chief Todd Chamberlain recently said the department hasn’t connected the suspects to any gangs, adding that it’s difficult to identify Tren de Aragua members specifically.\n“Many of these individuals we’re talking about come from a country which does not have a strong relationship with the United States, come from a country that does not have a database that they are going to share,” he said.\nAfter nearby sanctuary city Denver received the most number of migrants per capita in the country, some of the migrants began to spill over into neighboring Aurora, a city of 400,000 people.\nAnd Tren de Argua came with them.\nThe gang’s foothold in the quiet bedroom city led the city to form a task force to combat the gang.\nMaking matters worse are the sanctuary laws that limit local law enforcement’s ability to communicate with ICE, former ICE director in Denver , John Fabbricatore, recently told The Post.\n“More information continues to come out about Tren de Aragua growing their presence in Aurora and throughout Colorado. Because of sanctuary jurisdiction, the local police are missing out on important intelligence and information gathering being conducted by ICE,” Fabbricatore, who is now running to represent Colorado in Congress, said.\n“The sanctuary jurisdiction is aiding TdA and they know they can get away with more in Colorado than other states,” he added.\nFor top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Frigid temps create ideal conditions for Northeast Ohio winegrowers",
    "text": "Some of us may be dreading stepping outside during the recent cold snap, but it was a welcome shift in the weather for Northeast Ohio’s wine country. A deep freeze created ideal conditions for the Grand River Valley to harvest its grapes for ice wine. A call on social media for volunteers helped supplement the teams of vineyard workers picking grapes on Monday. Some started as early as 5 a.m. using headlamps and utility vehicles to gather the frozen fruit from the vine. “I’ve always wanted to do this. I’ve heard that people come out in this freezing weather and do it and I just thought it’d be a fun challenge to do,” said volunteer Scott Rooney, who lives nearby. Temperatures dipped into the single digits Monday morning and stayed in the teens throughout the day. “It’s really cold at the beginning, but once you get picking it’s not so bad. You warm up,” Rooney said. The frigid conditions were welcomed by wine producers who worried a warm start to the winter could jeopardize the ice wine season. “Basically, the grape has to be left on the vine, and they have to be frozen at 17 degrees Fahrenheit or below. And they have to remain that way for a couple of hours,” explained Mike Koller, the head winemaker at Debonne Vineyards. “Every year’s a little bit different. This year, we have pretty much perfect conditions.” True ice wine, known for its sweet, highly concentrated taste, requires the grapes to age and freeze on the vine. “Ice wine, we often think of something that’s produced in the vineyard, rather than in the wine cellar through years of aging in a barrel,” explained Gene Sigel, the vineyard manager for The Valley Wine Group. “What ages ice wine is the heating and cooling that happens until we reach that temperature in the teens.” Because of a warm December, this year’s harvest was one of the latest for the Grand River Valley. But the delay brings its own benefits to the 2024 vintage. “The trade-off in a year like this where we had to wait until January is the grapes have been through a lot of aging, warming and cooling, warming and cooling, so it’s added a lot of complexity in the flavors,” Sigel said. “There’s a lot of intensity of tangerine and citrus and lemon and lime mixed together with a dosage of sweetness and also acidity.” The Grand River Valley will celebrate its favorite winter beverage in March during the Ice Wine Festival. It’s become a way to attract tourists to the wine-growing region during a slower time of year. “The inception of the Ice Wine Festival was to get people out to the wineries to kind of kickstart the year,” Koller said. “So we’re hoping that’s what it does this year as well.” This year, seven different wineries will feature ice wine and food pairings throughout the month of March. The stops will also include vendors and entertainment on Saturdays. You can find more details about the 2024 Grand River Valley Ice Wine Festival by clicking here .",

    "text": "Mariana Rodríguez es “cancelada” por monetizar en medio de la crisis ambiental en NL\nMariana Rodríguez, esposa del gobernador Samuel García fue criticada en redes sociales, por su falta de empatía con la ciudadanía.\nEn los últimos días, el estado de Nuevo León ha enfrentado una grave crisis ambiental debido a los altos niveles de contaminación del aire. La calidad del aire en municipios como Santa Catarina y Monterrey ha alcanzado niveles peligrosos, con concentraciones de partículas PM10 por encima de lo recomendado por organismos de salud.\nLa principal causa de esta emergencia es una serie de incendios forestales en terrenos baldíos y zonas boscosas, lo que ha puesto en riesgo la salud de miles de habitantes.\nLas autoridades han respondido con alertas ambientales y medidas para mitigar la contaminación. Se ha recomendado a la población evitar actividades al aire libre, utilizar mascarillas y seguir las indicaciones oficiales. Sin embargo, esta crisis ha evidenciado la necesidad de políticas ambientales más estrictas y una mejor coordinación entre el gobierno, la industria y la ciudadanía para reducir los niveles de contaminación en la región.\nTE PUEDE INTERESAR:\nMariana Rodríguez enfrenta, por quinta ocasión, la tristeza de perder un bebé\n¿Por qué Mariana Rodríguez fue \"cancelada\" en redes sociales?\nEn medio de esta emergencia, Mariana Rodríguez, esposa del gobernador Samuel García y primera dama de Nuevo León, ha sido duramente criticada en redes sociales por una publicación que muchos consideraron insensible ante la crisis ambiental.\nA través de sus historias en Instagram, Mariana compartió una recomendación que generó controversia entre los internautas: la promoción de un purificador de aire de la marca Dyson, cuyo precio puede alcanzar los 25 mil pesos. En su video, expresó:\n“Hola, chabacanos. Les quiero platicar de mi nuevo purificador de ‘Dyson Big and Quiet Formaldehyde’. Ya saben que me encanta. Aquí lo tengo siempre prendido en mi casa. Es súper silencioso, hasta en la potencia máxima, y nos ayuda a mantener el aire purificado”.\nEl video desató una ola de críticas en redes sociales, ya que muchos lo interpretaron como una muestra de falta de empatía debido al problema ambiental que enfrentan miles de familias en Nuevo León. Mientras la mayoría de los ciudadanos sufre las consecuencias de la contaminación sin acceso a soluciones inmediatas, Mariana promovía un dispositivo que está fuera del alcance económico de la gran mayoría.\nAdemás, Rodríguez, quien buscó ser la alcaldesa de Monterrey, dijo que el purificador le ha servido mucho para mantener el ambiente limpio dentro de su propia casa.\n“Elimina hasta el 99.97% de todas las partículas y malos olores, etc. Nos ayuda a que toda nuestra casa esté en paz, purificada, y además es sumamente fácil de transportar porque tiene unas rueditas”.\nMuchos usuarios señalaron que Rodríguez vive en una burbuja privilegiada, sin comprender la realidad de quienes no pueden acceder a un purificador de aire y deben enfrentar la crisis sin recursos.\nLos usuarios cuestionaron si la primera dama de Nuevo León estaba aprovechando la crisis ambiental para promover un producto comercial, sin ofrecer soluciones reales a la población afectada.\nTE RECOMENDAMOS:\nLa ropa de Mariana Rodríguez de menos de $1,000 que tú también puedes tener\n¿Por qué hay una crisis ambiental en Nuevo León?\nNuevo León enfrenta una crisis ambiental multifacética que afecta la calidad de vida de sus habitantes y compromete el desarrollo sostenible de la región.\nLas principales causas de esta crisis incluyen: evaporación de combustibles de mala calidad contribuyen, déficit de áreas verdes y reforestación insuficiente, el estado enfrenta una crisis hídrica, sequías severas e incendios forestales y urbanos.\nLa crisis ambiental en Nuevo León pone en evidencia la falta de acciones concretas para abordar la contaminación en el estado. Mientras el gobierno estatal enfrenta una presión creciente para mejorar la calidad del aire y prevenir incendios forestales, la percepción pública de sus líderes se ha visto afectada.\nLa crisis ambiental sigue siendo un tema urgente, y los habitantes de Nuevo León exigen respuestas más allá de recomendaciones o medidas temporales. La indignación hacia Mariana Rodríguez es solo un reflejo del descontento generalizado ante la falta de soluciones efectivas.",

    "text": "Pakistan caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Thursday announced a ban on the New Year celebration in the country to express solidarity with the People in Gaza. In a brief address to the nation, Kakar urged to show solidarity with the Palestinians and exhibit sobriety and humility at the New Year. “Keeping in mind the seriously concerning situation in Palestine and to show solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters, there will be a strict ban by the government on holding any kind of event for New Year,” he said. He said that over 21,000 Palestinians were killed so far by the Israeli forces that “crossed all limits of violence and injustice” with around 9,000 children dead since the Israeli bombardment began on October 7. “The whole Pakistani nation and the Muslim world are in a sheer state of anguish over the massacre of innocent children and genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.” He said Pakistan had dispatched two aid packages to Palestine while a third package was being prepared. He said Pakistan was engaged in talks with Jordan and Egypt to provide timely aid to Palestine and to evacuate the injured present in Gaza. Kakar said Pakistan tried to highlight the plight of the Palestinian people on various global forums and would continue to do so in the future as well to stop the Israeli bloodshed. Pakistan’s New Year celebrations are traditionally not huge due to the influence of Islamic groups who try to stop the festivities through various methods, including the use of force. Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by The Telegraph Online staff and has been published from a syndicated feed.",

    "text": "Por Kathleen Magramo, CNN\nTreinta y una personas que trabajaban en un enorme túnel subterráneo en Los Ángeles fueron rescatadas el miércoles por la noche después de que una parte de la estructura se derrumbara, dijeron las autoridades.\nLos rescatados no tenían lesiones visibles, dijo el Departamento de Bomberos de Los Ángeles en un comunicado , poco después de una operación en la que varios de los atrapados en el túnel industrial fueron sacados a un lugar seguro con una grúa.\nMás de 100 bomberos del Departamento de Bomberos de Los Ángeles acudieron rápidamente a la escena en el vecindario de Wilmington de la ciudad para ayudar en la operación, incluidos los equipos de búsqueda y rescate urbano, dijo la alcaldesa de Los Ángeles, Karen Bass, en X.\nEl derrumbe se produjo aproximadamente a 8 a 10 punto de entrada y salida del túnel y a unos 121 metros bajo tierra, según informaron las autoridades. El túnel forma parte de un proyecto municipal de aguas residuales.\nLos trabajadores atrapados lograron trepar un montón de tierra suelta de entre 3,6 y 4,5 metros de altura para alcanzar a sus compañeros al otro lado, según informes preliminares. Desde allí, fueron transportados en un vehículo de túnel hasta el punto de acceso, según el departamento de bomberos.\nLos bomberos utilizaron grúas y jaulas de rescate para sacar a varios trabajadores, según un video de la afiliada de CNN, KCBS/KCAL .\nLa alcaldesa de Los Ángeles, Karen Bass, se reunió con los trabajadores rescatados y los servicios de emergencia en el lugar, según un video publicado en su cuenta X. “Gracias nuevamente a todos nuestros socorristas que trabajan para poner a salvo a los angelinos”, dijo Bass.\nLa falla ocurrió cuando los trabajadores estaban operando la tuneladora y una sección que ya habían construido se derrumbó debido al “apretamiento del suelo”, dijo Robert Ferrante, ingeniero jefe y gerente general de los Distritos de Saneamiento del Condado de Los Ángeles, en una conferencia de prensa el miércoles por la noche.\nEl aplastamiento del suelo se produce cuando el suelo o la tierra se deforma significativamente durante una excavación.\nLos trabajos en el lugar se detendrán y serán inspeccionados, agregó Ferrante, pero no dio detalles sobre cuánto tiempo tomará.\nLa supervisora ​​​​de la Junta del Condado de Los Ángeles, Janice Hahn, dijo que el incidente sirve como recordatorio de los riesgos que implican estos proyectos y que los distritos de saneamiento “investigarían” qué causó el incidente.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Early NFL days forever bond ex-Boilermaker David Nugent and NFL icon Tom Brady",
    "text": "Early NFL days forever bond ex-Boilermaker David Nugent and NFL icon Tom Brady\nAs far as roommates go, Tom Brady was easy to live with. At least that’s how David Nugent remembers it.\n“Clean and calm,” recalled Nugent. “He said one night when I plopped onto the couch and turned on the TV and he sat down at the computer desk behind me: ‘Well, we’ve assumed our positions, haven’t we?’ ” said Nugent.\nLike an old married couple … or something like that.\n“But he was just a great roommate, great friend, great person, great family,” said Nugent. “It was a cool experience.”\nThe former Purdue defensive lineman has stories to tell for a lifetime after rooming with the iconic NFL quarterback from 2000-2002, when they both played for the New England Patriots.\nBrady and Nugent were afterthoughts upon entering the NFL with the Patriots, Brady the 199th pick in the sixth round out of Michigan in 2000 and Nugent the 201st overall selection in the sixth round. It was just about making the cut and hanging on with a Patriots franchise trying to find its way under first-year coach Bill Belichick.\n“Tom was a very considerate roommate,” said Nugent. “Outside of our ‘wild’ Tecmo tourneys, we were pretty low-key.”\nNugent, 46, discussed his Brady roomy days in an Apple TV documentary called “The Dynasty: New England Patriots.” Nugent gave glimpses with still photos and home video of a player who would go from fourth-string quarterback to legend.\nThe two formed a fast friendship as rookies, as Nugent moved into the condo Brady had bought from Pats player and former Michigan teammate Ty Law.\n“We had some things in common,” said Nugent. “We were both sixth-round picks. We played against each other in college. So, we had that familiarity coming in. We had very similar personalities that we picked up on in training camp.”\nNugent and Brady had a third roommate in 2000: Harvard tight end Chris Eitzmann. But it was just Brady and Nugent in 2001, the year Brady led the Patriots to a stunning Super Bowl title over the Rams, and in 2002.\n“(Brady) didn’t want to live there by himself,” said Nugent. “And he just asked me one day if I wanted to be a roommate with him, and that’s how that started.”\nNugent had no idea what Brady was to become. No one did. But Nugent saw glimpses on the ground floor of Brady’s career.\n“Tom called me from Disney the day after the Super Bowl that he was planning on working out the next morning,” said Nugent. “I went to bed and he still hadn’t flown back in from Orlando yet.\n“I woke up to him knocking on my door saying it’s time to go to the stadium. It was still dark outside and we were the only two in the building. I remember thinking ‘this guy just won a Super Bowl and he’s already getting back after it!’ “\nNugent saw the now famous Brady passion in the offseaon, too.\n“You go to workouts in the morning, and then you’re done by noon, you got the rest of the day to do whatever,” said Nugent. “So, we would always just compete, whatever it looked like, whether it was video games or any kind of card games. That’s just kind of how we spent our downtime.”\nYou know the rest of the story. Brady went on enjoy one of the most decorated careers in NFL history, becoming the starting quarterback in 2001 and leading the Patriots to six Super Bowls. He’s a five-time Super Bowl MVP and three-time league MVP. For most, Brady is the GOAT.\n“Those early days, people really didn’t expect much,” said Nugent. “Because, he was just so calm. I know that sounds silly to say this, but gentle, too. He wasn’t a big rah-rah guy, but behind the scenes, living together, he was super focused on studying, wanted to maximize his potential. Was never satisfied with being a backup even though he had three guys in front of him.”\nNugent? His NFL stint was more modest, including a stop with the Ravens after playing in New England. He was out of the league after the 2002 season.\nAs Brady went on to collect Super Bowl trophies and records as arguably the best quarterback in NFL history, Nugent moved into the work-a-day world with career in medical sales and school administration while raising a family that now numbers four children in his native Tennessee.\nNugent matriculated to Purdue as part of Jim Colletto’s last recruiting class in 1996, a grouup that included future Patriot offensive linemen Matt Light and Brandon Gorin. Joe Tiller took over the program in 1997 and helped Purdue to bowls in Nugent’s final three seasons.\nThose dynastic New England teams were populated with Boilermakers over the years. In addition to Light, Gorin and Nugent, the Pats also employed Gene Mruczkowski, Rob Ninkovich, Rosevelt Colvin, Niko Koutouvides, Jason King, Ja’Whaun Bentley. All played in or won Super Bowls for Belichick’s teams.\n“Coach Belichick, and (director of personnel) Scott Pioli brought me into their office once and asked me about other Purdue players that I would recommend, and they had a couple of names that they threw out specifically,” said Nugent. “I remember they asked about Matt Light, and Rosevelt Colvin and Vinny Sutherland. So, it’s really neat to kind of pump those guys up in front of those two guys and ultimately, end up joining the team.”\nNugent says he has not seen Brady in roughly nine years. The future Hall of Famer is primed to be the lead NFL analyst on FOX broadcasts next season.\n“It’s funny, when he was still playing, every year, right around the playoff time, people would want to kind of dig up some old articles or whatever and I would always get asked for just a short little brief interview,” said Nugent.\nNugent’s days helping fill in biographical information won’t end anytime soon.",

    "text": "One of the challenges for Chinese companies in developing chip production machines is the shortage of experienced professionals. Therefore, they aggressively recruit Western personnel.\nThis phenomenon is especially common in fields such as advanced lithography and optics. Because companies like Huawei want only heasmt best, they recruit experienced professionals from [ASML](https://www.techzine.nl/nieuws/security/519519/asml-ceo-voorziet-risico-op-diefstal-van-intellectueel-eigendom/) and Zeiss SMT, offering lots of money in exchange for their knowledge and experience. This reports [tom’s Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinese-companies-poach-staff-from-asml-and-zeiss-with-three-times-higher-pay-employees-needed-to-design-and-build-chipmaking-tools-amid-sanctions) based on reporting by [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-tech-poaching-job-offer-pay-raise-f8ceac5b).\nThree times current salary\nHuawei approached employees of Germany’s Zeiss SMT, which produces optics for ASML’s lithography machines. The Chinese giant offered up to three times their current salary. This led to serious concerns in the U.S., Europe, and Asia about intellectual property theft and risks to national security.\nGerman intelligence began investigating after Zeiss employees raised the alarm, fearing that sensitive technological knowledge would fall into the wrong hands. Huawei also targeted other German companies, such as Trumpf, which develops laser amplifiers for chip production.\nTwo years ago, the U.S. government required its citizens and Green Card holders to apply for a permit to work in the Chinese semiconductor sector on certain products. This caused the departure of professionals at companies such as AMEC, Huawei and Naura. Those employees are crucial to building Chinese knowledge in chip production machinery.\nAs a result, Chinese companies accelerated their recruitment efforts in Europe. ASML and its suppliers, including Zeiss, are key targets. Huawei and other Chinese companies already hired dozens of engineers with expertise in advanced optics and lithography, with some reportedly transferring trade secrets to Chinese entities.\nStringent penalties in Taiwan\nCountries such as Taiwan, South Korea, and the U.S. have taken steps to crack down on such hiring practices. Taiwan has investigated about 90 cases of “headhunting” since 2020 and imposed severe penalties, including up to 12 years in prison for leaking critical semiconductor technology. South Korea has toughened penalties for unauthorized technology transfer, targeting former employees who help Chinese companies copy sensitive technologies.\nDespite controls, engineers in Asia, Europe, and even the U.S. remain open to recruitment attempts by Chinese companies. This allows companies like Huawei to consistently target engineers, sometimes through middlemen or local companies that conceal their Chinese origins.\nThese practices are called “spray and pray” strategies because they recruit en masse in hopes of making a few successful hires. Because Chinese chip machine manufacturers are often government-funded, they can offer salaries far above those of Western companies.\nTransfer of knowledge and expertise\nAlthough many engineers decline such offers because of reputational risks and cultural concerns, some accept them, often transferring valuable expertise and trade secrets. One case involved three employees of California-based FemtoMetrix, whose departure and subsequent data theft nearly destroyed the company.\nGovernments are struggling to regulate these practices. Taiwan, for example, has banned domestic companies from covering for Chinese recruiters. Larger-scale measures to restrict recruiting are encountering challenges, however, partly because of concerns about over-regulating business activities.",
