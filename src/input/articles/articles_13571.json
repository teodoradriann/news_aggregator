    "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — The deaths of several figure skaters, coaches, and their family members in a plane crash near Washington, D.C., are sending shockwaves through the sport, reaching as far as Iowa, where local skaters and coaches said the tragedy is deeply personal for the tight-knit community.\nThe midair crash, which occurred Tuesday evening over the Potomac River, involved an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter. Authorities confirmed that all 67 people on board both aircraft are presumed to have been killed. Among the victims were at least fourteen members of the figure skating community who had been returning from a national development camp in Wichita, Kansas, held in conjunction with the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.\n\"The skating community is very small, it is a huge loss to the skating community,\" said Tanya Street, a coach at the Cedar Rapids Ice Arena and a technical specialist and judge with U.S. Figure Skating. \"Waking up this morning and hearing the news was heart-wrenching. I had done all kinds of research to find out what skaters were involved and found out and realized that I knew the coaches, and my students had known the skaters, and that there was a connection here in Cedar Rapids with those that had died.\"\nAmong the victims identified as of early Thursday evening are two teenage skaters, Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, along with their mothers, Jin Han and Christine Lane. Renowned Russian-born coaches Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, former world champions in pairs figure skating, were also on board. The University of Delaware confirmed the deaths of former coach Sasha Kirsanov and skaters Sean Kay and Angela Yang.\n\"I know that I have a student that has been to those camps up until last year and he knew a lot of the skaters that had died in the plane crash. Another student had taken from the Boston coaches that were there, Vadim, he would travel to Boston for a week or two over the summer and work with them,\" Street said.\nThe skaters on board were not just rising athletes, but competitors at an elite level, training under some of the top coaches in the country, Street said.\n\"These were not just athletes. They were athletes that were at that next level,\" Street said. \"The national training camp, which is right after nationals. These are skaters that could make it. We here in Cedar Rapids, we've had only three people make it to that national training camp. And so, at that camp they learned from elite coaches as far as how to train, nutrition and jump techniques, spin technique, everything. And so, the skaters that were there, I mean, yes, this was something they loved but they were also at that level to be able to be there at that camp. And being that it was right after nationals, all the top coaches, top judges, everybody were there.\"\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration have launched an investigation into the crash. Preliminary reports indicate that neither aircraft made a distress call before the collision. The American Airlines jet was en route from Wichita to Reagan National Airport when it collided with the military helicopter.\nAs the investigation continues, Street said the figure skating community will come together to grieve and support one another.\n\"While we are a small community and the grief is hard, but we're also a supportive community and we get through, we'll get through it together,\" she said. \"The support system that we have is strong. And so we can get through this and remember them always.\"",

    "text": "WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, the City of Douglas was selected to receive $23,518,381 by the U.S. Department of Transportation to fund the development of a Complete Street study, which will help make streets in Douglas safer for vehicles, bikers, and pedestrians. It will also fund the design and construction of improvements to approximately 7.8-miles across approximately 10 roadways in Douglas, including pavement resurfacing, pedestrian facilities, safety counter measures, traffic circulation solutions, and improved drainage. The $23 million grant for the City of Douglas is part of the U.S Department of Transportation’s recent $1.8 billion award announcement from the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) discretionary grant program for 148 projects across the country. Representative Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-07) [submitted a letter of support](https://grijalva.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RAISE-Douglas-LoS-2024_KS_MK-JC_RG-1.pdf) for the City of Douglas and praised the announcement of the funding: “This federal funding is a massive investment for the City of Douglas to make critical improvements to its roadway infrastructure and improve the safety and connectivity for all who use it,” said Rep. Grijalva. “I’m proud to have supported this infrastructure and transportation project and will continue to support the City of Douglas as they pursue additional federal funding opportunities to help foster equity, accessibility, and prosperity.” The project is expected to improve the safety of motorized and non-motorized travelers through the implementation of Complete Streets solutions which will reduce fatalities and serious injuries, especially with conflicts created by trucks traversing downtown streets to and from the existing Port of Entry at the U.S./Mexico border. The project will also divert truck traffic away from the downtown area and help enhance safety and pave the way for the revitalization of the downtown into a vibrant and pedestrian oriented center. The project will also help improve the air quality in an area that has high asthma rates, as well as benefit the environment by removing contaminants from old mining landfills. The improvements will also enhance mobility for users of the city transportation system and bilingual signage will promote inclusivity.

    "text": "Un total de 202 muertes violentas se registraron este año en tres municipios mineros del estado Bolívar, el territorio más peligroso de Venezuela, según datos presentados este jueves por el Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia (OVV). En las localidades amazónicas de El Callao, Sifontes y Roscio se contabilizaron 91, 80 y 31 muertes violentas, respectivamente, lo que arroja las tasas de peligrosidad más altas del país, incluida la principal, de 424,7 fallecimientos por cada 100.000 habitantes, por causas “no naturales”. En esta región, se desplegaron este año dos grandes operaciones militares que “permitieron liberar de la minería criminal depredadora importantes parques nacionales y zonas protegidas de la naturaleza”, aseguró este jueves el presidente Nicolás Maduro. Durante un acto con la cúpula castrense, el mandatario explicó que, “por la vía de la presión militar y la presencia en la zona”, se logró “de manera pacífica la liberación completa” de estas áreas, que pidió seguir protegiendo. Organizaciones de derechos humanos han denunciado que en esta región están en auge delitos como la trata de personas, el narcotráfico y el asesinato por encargo debido a la presencia de grupos criminales que se disputan, entre ellos y con las autoridades, el control de las minas. Según el OVV, en el estado Miranda, cercano a Caracas, cuatro municipios están en la lista de los 10 más peligrosos, así como uno de Yaracuy, uno de Carabobo y otro de Zulia. Venezuela ha contabilizado este año 1.956 asesinatos, un 15,9 % menos que en 2022, cuando computó 2.328, lo que confirma que se mantiene la mejoría de la seguridad en el país, que en 2015 llegó a tener una tasa de 90 homicidios por cada 100.000 habitantes o a contabilizar cerca de 30.000 muertes violentas.

    "text": "An investigation into the operations of private internet service providers in Nigeria has been tasked to the House of Representatives’ Committee on Communications.\nThis directive came after the approval of a motion raised by the representative for Yagba East/Yagba West/Mopamuro Federal Constituency, Kogi State, Mr. Leke Abejide during Thursday’s plenary session.\nCiting concerns, the lawmaker highlighted that many internet service providers in the country have been avoiding responsibility for their inefficient and subpar services. Consumers are often forced to pay for inadequate services due to the lack of clear regulations on pricing and service quality, allowing these providers to take advantage of Nigerian citizens.\nIn his remarks, Abejide, a member of the African Democratic Congress, emphasized that consumers face daily challenges such as service disruptions, slow speeds, and unreliable connections. He stressed the essential nature of a reliable internet connection in today’s digital era.\nHe raised concerns about customers experiencing prolonged service outages without any mechanism for refunds, highlighting the disregard for consumer rights and exploitation by some ISPs.\nSpecifically, he pointed out the questionable practices of an ISP called Legend in Abuja, which charges high flat monthly rates despite frequent service interruptions.\nAbejide criticized Legend for providing reliable service only around the time of monthly billing to deceive customers into renewing subscriptions based on false performance impressions.\nExpressing disappointment in the lack of sanctions by the NCC against ISPs for poor services, Abejide underscored the broader negative impact of these practices on Nigerian society and economic activities.\nThe House instructed its Committee on Communications to investigate the operations of ISPs and present their findings within two weeks.\nAdditionally, they called on the NCC and relevant bodies to establish a consumer protection framework that includes compensation or refunds for extended service outages or deviations from advertised service levels.\nThe lawmakers also urged the NCC to implement a Pay As You Go policy for all ISPs to reduce exploitation where services are not delivered as promised.",
