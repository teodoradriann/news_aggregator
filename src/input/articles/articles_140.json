    "text": "Mumbai, March 8: A 90-year-old woman who escaped being kidnapped by Hamas men during the October 7 attack on Israel credits her survival to her love of football and Lionel Messi. The grandmother's story was featured in a documentary that tells the harrowing tale of her kidnap and heartwarming escape. Esther Cunio, an Argentinian-Israeli grandmother living in Kibbutz Nir Oz, managed to distract a gunman who knocked on her door by telling him she was from the same country as the world-famous football star. The abductor, who was apparently a fan of Messi, then asked her to pose with his rifle and make a victory sign for a video that later went viral on social media.

Messi Saves the Day! — buni de repuesto (@BuniRepuesto) [March 7, 2024] How Argentine grandma Escapes Hamas attack Cunio’s story is one of the many harrowing tales of survival that will be featured in a new documentary called “Voces de 7 de octubre - Latino Stories of Survival”. The film, produced by Fuente Latina, a non-profit that works with Spanish media covering Israel, will document the atrocities of October 7 from the perspective of Israelis from Latin America who experienced it. Israel-Hamas War October 7 was the day when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed across the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing over 250 hostages, mostly civilians, many amid horrific acts of brutality and sexual assault. [Israel-Hamas War: 28,985 Palestinians Killed in Gaza Since October 7, Says Health Ministry](https://www.latestly.com/world/israel-hamas-war-28985-palestinians-killed-in-gaza-since-october-7-says-health-ministry-5767748.html). Eight members of Cunio’s extended family were among the captives, and two of them, her grandchildren Ariel and David Cunio, are still being held by terrorists in Gaza. David’s wife and their twin 3-year-old daughters were released as part of a weeklong truce in late November, as were his sister-in-law Danielle Aloni and her daughter Emilia. Ariel’s girlfriend, Arbel Yehud, 28, is also still in captivity. Cunio hopes that Messi, who plays for Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentinian national team, will hear about her ordeal and pray for her grandchildren’s safe return. “Now I would ask for my grandchildren, for my two grandchildren who are locked up there, and I would tell him to please pray to God, to send them… that he tries to get them out because they are kids who are worth gold,” Cunio says in the film.

    "text": "Photo shows a beautiful view near Xijiang village of Nanxin township, in Nanchang county, Nanchang city, the capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, and an expressway runs through here. (People's Daily Online/Zhu Haipeng) An expressway passing near Xijiang village of Nanxin township, in Nanchang county, Nanchang city, the capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, forms a harmonious view combining a modern landscape with rural scenery. White-walled and red-tiled farmhouses line the route, contrasting delightfully with the rice paddies as they transition from green to golden hues. Striving for high-quality development in urban transportation, Nanchang city has expedited the construction of a modern comprehensive transportation system. A multi-tiered transportation network that connects the urban and rural regions has taken shape, creating a convenient and efficient travel environment for the public. By implementing an integrated development model that links transportation with characteristic industries and tourism, Nanchang strengthens the role of rural highways in boosting the development of rural industries. A steady increase in the improvement of tourism roads, resource roads, and industry development roads has been a powerful force in the revitalization of rural areas.

    "text": "[1](/lima/sjl-nicole-mesia-castro-suboficial-que-desaparecio-y-fue-encontrada-en-cusco-es-hallada-sin-vida-en-su-vivienda-pnp-ultimas-noticia/) La Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos ( [Corte IDH](https://elcomercio.pe/noticias/corte-idh/?ref=ecr/)) requirió al Estado peruano que se suspenda “inmediatamente” el trámite del proyecto de ley que está avanzando en el [Congreso de la República](https://elcomercio.pe/noticias/congreso-de-la-republica/?ref=ecr/) y que busca restringir los alcances de los delitos de lesa humanidad para que no puedan ser aplicados en casos cometidos antes del 2002. Esto, como parte de una resolución adoptada en el proceso que la corte internacional está realizando por un pedido de medidas provisionales que hicieron los deudos de los casos Barrios Altos y La Cantuta. Específicamente, la Corte IDH requiere al Perú que “suspenda inmediatamente” el trámite del dictamen del proyecto de ley 6951/2023/CR que busca precisar la “aplicación y alcances del delio de lesa humanidad y crímenes de guerra en la legislación peruana”. La corte señala que esta suspensión debe aplicarse hasta que cuenten con todos los elementos para pronunciarse sobre las medidas provisionales y el impacto que tendrá esta norma en los casos Barrios Altos y La Cantuta que fueron resueltos por este fuero internacional. Asimismo, se procedió a convocar al Estado peruano, así como a los representantes de los deudos de Barrios Altos y La Cantuta y a la Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH) a una audiencia pública virtual para el lunes 17 de junio del 2024 las 8:30 a.m. hora de Costa Rica. En la audiencia, la Corte IDH evaluará la solicitud de las víctimas. El dictamen que deberá ser objeto de esta suspensión fue aprobado por el pleno del Congreso en primera votación con 60 votos a favor, 36 en contra y 11 abstenciones. Actualmente, se encuentra pendiente de ser sometido a una segunda votación antes de ser remitido al Gobierno para su promulgación y posterior entrada en vigencia, o para que pueda ser observado y regresado al Parlamento. La propuesta fue promovida por los parlamentarios José Cueto (Honor y Democracia) y Fernando Rospigliosi (Fuerza Popular). Plantea que, como el Estatuto de Roma de la Corte Penal Internacional fue aprobado recién el 1 de julio 2002; y a Convención sobre la Imprescriptibilidad de los Crímenes de Guerra y de los Crímenes de Lesa Humanidad el 9 de noviembre de 2003, respectivamente, los delitos cometidos antes de esas fechas “prescriben en los plazos establecidos en la ley nacional”, eliminando así la imprescriptibilidad de estos casos.",
