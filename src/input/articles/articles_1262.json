    "text": "\"They're going to take this and run with it. I hope they put it in their locker.\"\nBy Alicia de Artola | 6:18 PM EST\nCincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase / Sam Greene/The Enquirer / USA TODAY\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are a wounded animal after a shock loss to the Raiders in Week 16. And Ja'Marr Chase is poking the bear.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver dropped some inflammatory comments about the Chiefs' secondary ahead of their Week 17 matchup on Sunday.\nChase said nothing stands out about the Chiefs secondary: \"It's not really like they got a Jalen Ramsey on their squad.\"\nJa’Marr Chase had quite the edge after practice today addressing reporters. Said Chiefs don’t have anyone that stands out on defense. “It’s not really like have a Jalen Ramsey on their squad.” pic.twitter.com/1kurBwcOLF\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags) December 28, 2023 Chase also said he doesn't know who KC safety Bryan Cook (who is on IR) is and that going against that secondary is not the same as going against someone like Jessie Bates. He added that the Chiefs double-team him and Tee Higgins because they know their secondary can't go one-on-one with them.\nJa'Marr Chase gift-wrapped bulletin board material to Chiefs secondary None of this was said with ignorance as to how the Chiefs might react to hearing it. He also wasn't completely lacking compliments for the defense he's about to face. He credited them for knowing how to play against the Bengals receivers while praising L'Jarius Sneed in particular as the best player on defense.\n\"I'm just adding fire to the fuel,\" Chase said. \"They're going to take this and run with it. I hope they put it in their locker but it's alright though. As long as I'm mentally ready to play.\"\nJa’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.” pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags) December 28, 2023 The last time Chase faced off with the Chiefs, he had six catches for 75 yards but Kansas City prevailed in the AFC Championship Game. This rematch features two teams that aren't anywhere near as dominant as they were last year.\nThe Chiefs are coming off that loss to the Raiders. Their only win in the last four games was against the hapless Patriots.\nThe Bengals lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending injury and have had some positive results with backup Jake Browning. However, they're coming off a blowout loss to the Steelers.\nChase may not be fully healthy for the matchup either. He's been limited in practice with a shoulder injury he sustained against the Vikings.\n3 NFL teams on upset alert this Sunday. dark.

    "text": "GAZA STRIP, Palestinian Territories — Mediators pushed on with efforts for an Hamas-Israel ceasefire as fighting raged on in the besieged Gaza Strip on Thursday, deepening a dire humanitarian crisis. The Qatar-based leader of Hamas Ismail Haniyeh was expected in Cairo on Thursday or Friday for talks on a proposed truce.\nThe group was reviewing a proposal for a six-week pause in its war with Israel, a Hamas source told AFP, after mediators gathered in Paris.\nIn Gaza, there was no let-up in fighting or aerial bombardment, with the current focus of combat in Khan Yunis, where Israel says leading Hamas fighters are hiding.\nOvernight, witnesses said several Israeli air strikes hit the city, while aid and health workers have for days reported heavy fighting, particularly around two hospitals.\nAccording to the health ministry in Gaza, 119 people were killed in the latest night of strikes.\n\"There is a massacre taking place right now,\" said Leo Cans of international aid group Doctors Without Borders.\nIsrael accuses Hamas of operating from tunnels under hospitals in Gaza and of using medical facilities as command centres, a charge denied by the Islamist group, which is designated a “terrorist” organisation by the European Union and the United States.\nDue to constraints on the delivery of humanitarian aid, the population is “starving to death”, the World Health Organisation’s Emergencies Director Michael Ryan said on Wednesday.\n“The civilians of Gaza are not parties to this conflict and they should be protected, as should be their health facilities,” he added.\nIn its latest update, the UN reported heavy bombardment across the Gaza Strip, particularly in Khan Yunis, while it said 184,000 more Palestinians from the city had registered to receive humanitarian assistance after fleeing their homes in recent days.\nThree-stage plan\nAs Qatari and Egyptian-led mediation efforts intensified, Haniyeh was due in Cairo to discuss a truce proposal thrashed out in Paris last weekend with CIA chief William Burns.\nA Hamas source told AFP the three-stage plan would start with an initial six-week halt to the fighting that would see more aid deliveries into the Gaza Strip.\nOnly “women, children and sick men over 60” held by Hamas fighters would be freed during that stage in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, the source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.\nThere would also be “negotiations around the withdrawal of Israeli forces”, with possible additional phases involving more hostage-prisoner exchanges, said the source, adding that Gaza’s rebuilding was also among issues addressed by the deal.\nFollowing the deadliest attack in Israel’s history on October 7, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\nThe UN Conference on Trade and Development said tens of billions of dollars would be required to rebuild Gaza, which “currently is uninhabitable” as half its structures are damaged or destroyed.\nAid access\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out withdrawing troops from Gaza and has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the October 7 surprise attack.\nNetanyahu has also opposed releasing “thousands” of Palestinian prisoners as part of any deal.\nWith scores of Israeli hostages still trapped in Gaza, there has been mounting criticism of Netanyahu’s government that has triggered street protests and calls for an early election.\nFor people in Gaza, access to aid has been further hampered by a controversy surrounding the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, after Israel accused several of its staff of involvement in the Hamas attack.\nThe claims last week saw several donor countries, led by key Israel ally the United States, freeze funding for the agency.\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres told a UN committee he had “met with donors to listen to their concerns and to outline the steps we are taking”.\nUNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told AFP the agency supports “an independent investigation” into the Israeli claims that led to the funding crisis.\nNetanyahu told a meeting of UN ambassadors in Jerusalem that UNRWA had been “totally infiltrated” by Hamas and called for other agencies to replace it.\nThe US State Department has said 12 UNRWA employees “may have been involved” out of 13,000 in Gaza and has said that it is “imperative” that the agency continue its “absolutely indispensable role”.\nThe war’s impact has been felt widely, with violence involving Iran-backed allies of Hamas across the Middle East surging since October and drawing in US forces among others.\nThe White House blamed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran armed groups, for a drone attack that killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan on the northeastern borders with Syria.",

The decision was taken at the corporation’s 235th board meeting.\nFrom next month, the wages of contract workers will rise by Rs 500. Around 500 contract workers and security personnel are on NBSTC’s rolls. Wages for temporary contractors and mechanics will also go up by Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 by December.\n“Our priority is worker welfare,” NBSTC Chairman Partha Pratim Roy said.\n“From January, contract workers will get wages as per state labour rules.”\nHe added: “Security guards now get Rs 10,000, up from Rs 9,500. From January, it will be Rs 11,500.”\nThe board also cleared a smart card scheme to be rolled out before Durga Puja. “Passengers will be able to preload money and use the card to buy tickets on any government bus in the state,” Roy said. On publicity plans, Roy remarked: “With the Chief Minister’s nod, NBSTC vehicles will carry ads for state schemes like Kanyashree and Lakshmi Bhandar.” NBSTC is also adding to its fleet. “We have received six Volvos and have requested six more,” Roy confirmed.",

    "text": "|\n(CercleFinance.com) - Le chômage n'a que faiblement reflué en Allemagne au mois de novembre, selon des chiffres publiés jeudi par l'Office fédéral du travail, qui estime que la faiblesse de l'économie continue de mettre le marché du travail 'à rude épreuve'.\nLe nombre de personnes sans emploi a diminué de 17.000 sur le mois qui s'achève pour atteindre 2.774.000, tandis que le taux de chômage a baissé de 0,1 point de pourcentage à 5,9%.\nPar rapport au même mois de l'année dernière, ce dernier s'inscrit néanmoins en hausse de 0,3 point de pourcentage.\nPour rappel, le climat des affaires n'a cessé de se détériorer Outre-Rhin ces derniers mois, illustrant le climat de stagnation économique, voire de récession, qui gagne actuellement le pays.\nD'après les analystes, le PIB de l'Allemagne devrait ressortir à la fin de l'année à un niveau proche de son niveau de la fin 2021, soit trois années de stagnation.\nCopyright © 2024 CercleFinance.com.

    "text": "Ukrainians are putting machine guns first designed in the US at the end of World War I on the back of pickup trucks to try to shoot down Russian drones and spy planes.\nSoldiers in Ukraine’s 117th Territorial Defense Brigade are using guns, including the M2 Browning, to try to take down Russia’s Shahed drones,\nthe Kyiv Independent reported.\nThe M2 was used by American forces in World War II, and is still used by some today, but it was initially developed in 1918, the last year of World War I.\nThe Kyiv Independent, which visited one Ukrainian unit, reported that they are often the first to confront drones that Russia fires north, toward the cities of Sumy and Kyiv.\nIts members monitor the sky, watch their tracking equipment, and drive where needed, eager to shoot down whatever they can.\nRussia has been firing drones and missiles at Ukrainian cities and infrastructure since it launched its full-scale invasion, often targeting places far from the front lines.\nThese attacks have killed civilians, destroyed residential buildings, and damaged Ukraine’s energy network.\nUkraine faces a dilemma when it comes to shooting them down.\nShahed drones are\nestimated to cost around $20,000 each, but some of the air-defense missiles that Ukraine has in its arsenal have a price tag in the millions.\nUkraine’s supply of air-defense missiles has also been running low after Republicans stalled billions in further aid for six months.\nSoldiers often had to make difficult choices about when to use their precious stockpile.\nThat’s where weapons like the M2 Browning come in.\nIts predecessor, the M1917, was\ndesigned by American John Browning and first used in 1917, with the M2 coming the following year.\nBoth Russia and Ukraine have\nused decades-old equipment and weaponry in the war, sometimes because it is proven to be reliable and sometimes due to shortages of more modern supplies.\nThe unit’s leader, call sign Dias, described the Browning to the Kyiv Independent as “reliable, user-friendly” and with a higher fire rate.\nBut he and other soldiers still said they desired more modern weapons: “We’re eager to take down Shaheds. We could cut them with such weapons,” he said.\nDias’ unit is made up of 16 soldiers, who were all civilians before Russia’s invasion, the outlet reported.\nDias, who had combat experience, said he “taught them to shoot and survive” and that they have downed six Shaheds and 12 reconnaissance aircraft.\nHe described the unit as protecting the city of Sumy, which is close to the border with Russia, and said that his unit works within range of Russian artillery, guided bombs, and first-person-view drones.\nAnother soldier described the wider region to the Kyiv Independent as “Ukraine’s northern shield.”\nHe called their group “the last defensive line” for the area.\nThe post\nUkrainians on pickup trucks are using machine guns designed in WWI to stop Russian drones appeared first on Business Insider.",
