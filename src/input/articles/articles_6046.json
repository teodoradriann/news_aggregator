    "text": "FTC is on the offensive to save its noncompete ban The Federal Trade Commission is on the offensive to save its noncompete ban, filing an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on Oct. 18. Two months prior, a federal judge in Texas halted the FTCs [ban on noncompete agreements](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/how-the-ftcs-proposed-ban-on-noncompetes-could-impact-lenders) The agency said it [was disappointed with the outcome](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/federal-judge-halts-implementation-of-ftcs-noncompete-ban) The FTC declined to comment Thursday. In her decision that struck down the rule, Judge Ada Brown of the U.S. District Court in Dallas said the FTC's ban on noncompetes violated the Administrative Procedure Act, exceeded the agency's statutory authority and should be \"set aside.\" \"The Commission's lack of evidence as to why they chose to impose such a sweeping prohibition — that prohibits entering or enforcing virtually all noncompetes — instead of targeting specific, harmful noncompetes, renders the rule arbitrary and capricious,\" Brown wrote in a filing. The decision stemmed from legal actions the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others quickly filed against the FTC after the agency released its rule in April. Opponents of the ban, including the Chamber, argued it represented an illegal overreach that could harm competition. Under the FTC's scrapped rule, employers would be prohibited from entering into or enforcing new noncompetes with senior executives, though existing ones would remain in place. Around 30 million workers are subject to noncompetes, or close to 20% of the nation's workforce, the FTC estimates. Noncompetes are sometimes used in the mortgage industry to keep loan originators, executives and marketing personnel from jumping ship to competitors. They may also be used to protect information after an executive leaves a company, attorneys have said in previous interviews. Nonsolicitation agreements are much [more common in the mortgage industry](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/loan-officers-may-be-insulated-from-ftcs-noncompete-ban) Legal experts say that while the noncompete rule is blocked, employers should not get complacent in monitoring changes that impact employee agreements. \"For now, the FTC noncompete ban remains blocked, but the battle is far from over,\" wrote Troy Garris, co-managing partner at law firm Garris Horn, in a blog. \"With the Fifth Circuit set to weigh in, and the potential for this issue to reach the Supreme Court, employers should stay vigilant.\"",

    "text": "2025 has been an interesting year thus far for AEW, with the quality of weekly TV on the up, but the negatively-received main event scene has battled to keep the momentum of the company down. There have been plenty of positives throughout the year though, and certain wrestlers have stood out as being more important than ever to AEW.\nRelated\nEvery AEW Championship Design In 2025, Ranked Worst To Best\nWe will take a look at the current iteration of every AEW title in 2025, determining how nice they look from worst to best.\nWhether it be their star power, their consistent quality, or the value they hold to the long-term success of AEW, the following wrestlers have staked a claim for being the most valuable assets that Tony Khan has on his current day roster.\n10 Konosuke Takeshita\nAEW Can Always Count On Takeshita\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n9-2 |\nKonosuke Takeshita might not be a main eventer in AEW, but is always one of the absolute best wrestlers on the card on any given night, and that makes him so important to the weekly AEW product. Even on a weaker show, Takeshita can bring instant quality, as he showed in his run as International Champion.\nAEW needs to ensure that Takeshita continues being a key focus across shows, whether than be a nasty heel under Don Callis or eventually breaking out into a popular babyface star.\n9 Ricochet\nHe Has Become A Valuable Asset In 2025\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\nN/A |\n6-3 |\nIf you’d made the claim one year ago that Ricochet would be one of AEW’s most valuable wrestlers, you’d likely have been laughed at. However, his heel work in AEW has made him one of the most captivating and entertaining characters on the entire roster today.\nHe has been doing some of the best work of his career both on the mic and in the ring, making him a very valuable member of the roster. Bringing both character and in-ring quality is exactly what AEW needs on a consistent basis to build stars and keep fans enticed.\n8 Kenny Omega\nHis Return Has Been Needed For AEW\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n4-0 |\n2025 saw Kenny Omega return to AEW, and his arrival back on weekly programming has been massively important for overall star power on the show. Omega is a pivotal part of AEW’s history and he has been sorely missed during his injury absence.\nOmega has been better than ever between the ropes, having standout matches with the likes of Konosuke Takeshita and Kyle Fletcher. He is clearly very valuable to AEW, and the promotion will want to ensure he stays healthy for the whole year.\n7 Mariah May\nShe Is Both A Present And Future Women’s Division Star\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n2-2 |\nMariah May is just 26 years of age, and she has already played as one half of one of the best women’s feuds in professional wrestling history. She is only going to get better, and this makes her a hugely valuable star for AEW going forwards.\nRelated\n10 Best AEW Wrestlers Of 2025 (So Far)\nAEW's roster is full of talent, but who has been the best wrestler so far in 2025?\nEven though her reign as AEW Women’s World Championship wasn’t ideal, she showed glimpses of brilliance, particularly in her rivalry with Toni Storm. Her value comes in the fact that she is a star of both the present and future of AEW’s women’s division.\n6 Kyle Fletcher\nA Clear Star In The Making For AEW\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\nN/A |\n2-2 |\nAEW’s handling of Kyle Fletcher has been masterful over the last year, gradually building him up to being a defined star in the promotion and a clear star of the future.\nHis heel work has been getting better and better, and his resume of great matches is only continuing to grow as the months drive on. Given his age and talent, he is undoubtedly a hugely valuable member of the AEW roster.\n5 Mercedes Mone\nOne Of The Best Wrestlers In The World\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n4-0 |\nMercedes Mone’s time in AEW has experienced ups and downs, but she is still one of the most valuable members of the AEW roster. When matched with the right opponent, Mone showcases herself as one of the best wrestlers in the world, and that is exactly why she is so vital to AEW.\nMone has star power, crossover ability, and in-ring brilliance, and when AEW decides to push her to the very top of the division she will be even more valuable.\n4 Will Ospreay\nOspreay Is Already An Iconic Performer\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n10-0 |\nWill Ospreay has been a consistently great performer in AEW and he is always massively over with fans, and this type of connection with the audience is something that should not be overlooked.\nHis style, quality, and level of popularity is an element that can be turned into something special in years to come. He is one of the names on the AEW roster who can define the promotion and be built as a draw with the right booking. He has had some of AEW’s best ever matches already, and is constantly stealing the show into 2025.\n3 Adam Page\nHangman Can Always Steady AEW’s Ship\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n6-1 |\nAt AEW’s worst times, Adam Page has been one of the wrestlers who can pick up the pieces and deliver. In 2023 and 2024, his feud with Swerve Strickland was easily the best thing the company put forth, and in 2025 he has shown his importance once again by helping to turn MJF’s momentum around.\nPage is very much AEW’s main character and has been since day one. He is so valuable to the heart and soul of the company.\n2 Swerve Strickland\nStrickland Is A Gem On AEW’s Roster\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n3-3 |\nSwerve Strickland is the most valuable member of the men’s division in WWE. He is so unique to everyone else on the roster, has a complete package, and carries himself with immense aura.\nRelated\n10 Baffling AEW Creative Decisions They Already Made In 2025\nWe're only a few months into 2025 and AEW has already made some bad booking decisions!\nHe has been on top form for years now, and his value to AEW cannot be overstated. Whether it be as AEW World Champion, a blood feud with Adam Page, or carrying the upper midcard, Strickland is an absolute sensation and massively important to AEW’s long-term future.\n1 Toni Storm\nAEW’s Most Valuable Wrestler Right Now\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n7-1 |\nToni Storm has been on fire for a while now, but 2025 has seen her take things to another level as AEW Women's World Champion. She is at the top of the food chain when it comes to women’s wrestling in any promotion, having one of the most captivating gimmicks of all time.\nAEW need to retain Storm for years to come, as she is the face of their women’s division and someone who is so unique, marketable, and talented, not to mention the fact that she is still young and has not even reached her prime.",

    "text": "LAHORE: Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari has said that the so-called ‘Fitna’ party has been continuously staging rallies and protests to incite unrest for the past year. According to her, the PTI’s gatherings have only served to sow discord and division. She claimed that the prisoner in Adiala Jail has shown no loyalty to the country or the nation. She further described those she referred to as “digital terrorists” as neither peaceful nor civilised, rather as representing the most extreme form of radicalism. Bokhari continued, “We have been hearing for a long time about the announcement, postponement, and rescheduling of rallies. The chaos they create in press conferences and on social media is the same chaos they intend to spread through their rallies. True politicians engage in peaceful struggles, while those lacking political integrity resort to spreading panic and disorder under the guise of a struggle.” The information minister also said that the youth of Pakistan now see through the reality of the Adiala Jail prisoner and his so-called mentor. She expressed shock that those who have led vicious campaigns against political leaders and heads of institutions for over a year and a half now claim to be advocates of peace. “How can those who attacked over 200 military installations and burned the statues of martyrs speak of peace? The time has come to hold accountable every individual involved in the failed coup attempt of May 9th,” Bokhari emphasised.",

(Village of Homer Glen) By Michelle Mullins | Chicago Tribune PUBLISHED: February 20, 2025 at 5:54 PM CST Funeral services will be held Sunday for 9-year-old Adalind Akiko Grande, Homer Glen’s honorary mayor, who died Feb. 14 after a long battle with cancer.\nAdalind, who was affectionately known as Warrior Addy, was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 2021 and spent the last several years in and out of remission.\nIn December, Addy, a Homer Glen resident and student at Reed Elementary School, was bestowed the title of honorary mayor and was the guest of honor at the village’s Homer for the Holidays festival. She turned on the holiday lights to kick off the season and had a chance to meet Anna and Olaf from Disney’s “Frozen.”\nAs part of her duties as mayor, she presided over a Village Board meeting. She sat at the head of the dais, led the Pledge of Allegiance and signed important documents.\nAddy’s mom, Jacqueline Grande, said her daughter’s health began deteriorating in late December, and she was sleeping more and eating less.\nGrande, Addy and her younger sister Aurora took a trip to Disney World with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nGrande said that while Addy’s health was starting to worsen and she was having mobility issues, she will never forget the sheer joy and excitement on her daughter’s face during the trip.\nGrande said she will remember Addy for being sweet, loving and kind.\n“She was so smart, so creative,” Grande said. “She was such a good artist. She never ceased to amaze me.”\nOne of their last memories was creating handprints and talking about the television show “Bluey.”\nGrande said the family was able to give her final kisses and say goodbye. She commended Addy’s long battle with cancer, saying she grew up quicker than she should have and “fought so hard.”\n“I have years and years of amazing memories,” Grande said. “She touched so many lives.”\n“I have comfort in knowing she is in heaven and watching over me. I feel she was meant to be my guardian angel.”\nVillage of Homer Glen Addy Grande, 9, and her sister, Aurora, enjoy a visit with “Frozen” characters Anna and Olaf at the Homer for the Holidays festival. Addy, who is known as Warrior Addy, was honorary mayor and turned on the holiday lights for the season. (Village of Homer Glen) The village of Homer Glen released a statement about its “mini Mayor.”\n“Addy’s story was extremely impactful and she made a lasting impression on everyone she met,” the statement said. “Addy, we were honored to have you and will never ever forget you. Thanks for creating lasting memories with us. We will cherish them. Addy’s courage and resilience will live on and encourage others in their fight, and her smile is eternal.”\nProject Fire Buddies, a nonprofit organization of firefighters helping children battling critical illnesses, released a statement from its Homer Township chapter.\n“From the moment she became part of our Fire Buddies family, she showed incredible strength, resilience and a light that could brighten even the darkest days,” it said. “Addy’s spirit will forever remain a part of us, and we are honored to have been a small part of her journey.”\nVisitation will be held from 1 to 7 p.m. Sunday at the Richard J. Modell Funeral Home, 12641 W. 143rd St., Homer Glen. Interment is private.\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks for donations to Adalind Grande’s Zeffy account , which can be found on the Warrior Addy Facebook page.\nAddy’s obituary can be found at www.rjmodellfh.com .\nMichelle Mullins is a freelance reporter for the Daily Southtown\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Gov.

    "title": "\"600分只能上二本\"，浙江2025年高考特招线592分，考生欲哭无泪|考试|高考分数|成绩查询时间_网易订阅",
    "text": "高考查分对于多数学生来说都是一个独特的体验， 带着迫切、有带着紧张的心情也算是人生难有的感受了，不少考生甚至不敢直接查看完整的分数，而是选择用书或者身份证，挡着一部分分数，慢慢挪开去看。\n先看到的通常是第一位数字，第一位数字是4、是5、还是6，对于今后的命运有着截然不同的意义， 一般家庭如果能看到孩子是6开头的数字，肯定喜上眉梢了， 毕竟哪怕是600分，即便不能去优质985、选一个头部211也完全没问题了。\n可对于浙江考生来说，600分却不是一个值得喜悦的好消息，恰恰相反， 如果在浙江考出了600分的成绩，以今年的高考局势来看，最多只能在本地上一个稍微好些的二本。\n浙江2025年高考特招线592分，5.2万人600分以上，690分考生降一半\n2025年浙江高考的特招线为592分，比2024年的595分下降了3分， 特招线的下降也是由于今年浙江高考的题目难度有所增加，而从一分一段表来看，今年的题目难度变化对整体的成绩水平产生了不小的影响。\n600分以上考生总数从2024年的5.4万人减少到5.2万人， 约少了2000人；而690分及以上的考生人数也从去年的1039人骤降至513人，减少了一半多；再看高分段的表现情况：今年693分就能达到300名的位次，而去年同样的位次至少需要699分才能达到。\n看着网上不少浙江考生欲哭无泪的抱怨：“600分只能上二本”，其他地区的考生和家长都表示无法理解，毕竟即便是同样实行新高考的地区， 也没有哪个省份像浙江这样，“卷”到600分都只能上二本的程度。\n之所以会有这样的局面，其实跟浙江省高考的特点有直接关系， 浙江高考采用赋分制，赋分制本身就会让分数有一定的“水分”， 首年采用新高考赋分制的省份都不同程度的出现了分数虚高的情况。\n而在此基础上，浙江省部分科目还有两次考试机会，而且取较高的那次分数计入总分，这种操作直接导致了浙江省的高考分数整体水平居高不下， 特招线也连续四年维持在了590分以上的水平。\n在其他省份，高考600分以上能够得上985、211，而在浙江省，高考600分的水平最多只能上一所相对好一些的二本， 也难怪浙江考生欲哭无泪了：考了高分也没啥用，大家分数都虚高，高分也就没什么意义了。\n当600分只能上二本，“虚高”的分数让志愿填报有了新的挑战\n当600分只能上二本时，这种“虚高”的分数对于志愿填报来说无疑是增添了许多新的挑战，对于浙江地区的考生和家长们来说， 志愿填报看分数显然已经没有意义了，最关键的还得看排名位置。\n尤其是部分分数出现的“扎堆”现象更要注意， 600分以上的人数突破5万大关，这意味着不仅仅凭分数难以实现突破，即便关注排名也仍难以做出最准确的评估和决策， 这也就需要考生和家长更多的关注历年录取分数和排名变化趋势，只有更合理的设置志愿梯度，才能争取到更稳妥的录取机会。\n浙江高考的分数现状也给其他地区的考生和家长们敲响了警钟， 在这个普遍追求高分的教育环境里，浙江高考却给我们另一种极端情况下的参考答案：当一个地区教育资源丰富、高分成了普遍现象后，这种高分扎堆不但没有带来更多的教育机会，反而让加剧了升学的难度和考生的焦虑情绪。\n值得引起重视的是，随着教育水平的提高和竞争的加剧，其他省份也可能面临类似情况， 如何避免这种情况成为一种趋势，是教育发展中必须深思的问题之一。\n今日话题：你如何看待这件事呢？\n（所有图片均来源于网络，如有侵权，请联系删除）",
