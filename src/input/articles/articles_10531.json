    "text": "Emmanuel LANGELLIER, Media365 : publié le jeudi 25 juillet 2024 à 22h24\nRafael Nadal a annulé sa séance d'entraînement avec Alexander Zverev, prévue jeudi à Roland-Garros. Et s'il renonçait finalement aux Jeux Olympiques de Paris 2024 ?\nA 38 ans, Rafael Nadal est heureux comme un gosse en cette fin juillet. Le joueur aux 22 titres du Grand Chelem en a vécu de grands moments de sa carrière mais il a encore faim et pour, peut-être, l'un de ses derniers challenges, il vise une médaille aux Jeux Olympiques de Paris 2024. Une capitale française qu'il connaît si bien pour y avoir triomphé 14 fois à Roland-Garros et qu'il a retrouvée lundi dans un esprit très spécial. L'Espagnol constitue ainsi l'une des plus grandes stars du village olympique où il a déambulé en compagnie de son compatriote Carlos Alcaraz, le lauréat des derniers Internationaux de France avec qui il jouera en double.\nNadal avec un bandage à la cuisse droite « Ça me rajeunit d'être ici, a reconnu « Rafa » ces derniers jours. C'est une manière de vivre au jour le jour très différente de ce que l'on vit sur le circuit avec toutes les commodités, les facilités. Ça te fait revenir aux sources, à tes débuts, quand tu jouais des tournois plus petits et qu'on se retrouvait dans des hôtels ou des chambres qui n'avaient rien à voir avec ceux d'aujourd'hui. » Jeudi, l'ancien numéro 1 mondial a connu une journée chargée. Il a tout d'abord appris le tirage au sort. Dans un tableau de simple déserté par Jannik Sinner et Holger Rune, blessés, Nadal affrontera le Hongrois Marton Fucsovics au premier tour avant de probablement défier... Novak Djokovic au tour suivant si les deux rivaux s'imposent. Waouh, un Nadal-Djokovic aux JO à Roland-Garros, cela serait sensationnel ! Puis l'ambiance s'est quelque peu tendue. Alors qu'il devait s'entraîner sur le court central avec Alexander Zverev, qui l'avait éliminé au premier tour du Grand Chelem français fin mai, Nadal a annulé cette session.\nTouché à la cuisse droite qui était entourée d'un bandage lors de sa séance intensive de double avec Alcaraz mercredi, le Taureau de Manacor a préféré ne pas prendre de risque et laisser reposer son organisme. Une simple alerte visiblement. Mais méfiance avec le corps du tennisman ibérique, tant on sait les pépins physiques des dernières années... Finaliste à Bastad dimanche dernier, Nadal avait beaucoup donné sur la terre battue en Suède avant de rater l'occasion d'accrocher un 93eme titre en carrière contre le Portugais Nuno Borges . En compagnie d'Alcaraz, l'homme aux 14 Roland-Garros est programmé samedi soir (pas avant 19 heures) sur le court Philippe-Chatrier pour affronter le duo argentin Molteni-Gonzalez (tête de série numéro 6 de l'épreuve olympique).",

    "text": "成都将推出超百个乡村消费新场景\n- 本报讯（四川日报全媒体记者 王晋朝）3月12日，成都发布《营造乡村旅游消费新场景工作方案》，旨在通过跨界融合、政策创新和城乡协同，探索一条文旅融合赋能乡村振兴的“成都路径”。《方案》提出，到2027年，成都将推出100个以上特色鲜明的乡村消费新场景，培育十大乡村旅游特色标杆项目。\n《方案》明确，任务实施采用“市级统筹+区县主责+社会参与”的三级机制。市级“搭台子”，统筹破解土地、资金、审批等政策壁垒，如创新推出“设施用地5%弹性政策”，允许乡村旅游项目配套建设使用5%的设施用地，为民宿、营地等新业态腾出空间。区县挑大梁，《方案》明确了各区（市、县）依托自身资源，打造符合区域特色的文旅融合新场景，首创“剧本杀+田园野趣”“民俗表演+非遗工坊”等跨界玩法，通过“沉浸式体验+在地化消费”双轮驱动，为乡村产业振兴开辟“流量变现”新路径。市场主体与村民成为“合伙人”，创新乡村资产盘活利用机制，采用“公司+农户”“合作社+农户”“创客+农户”“村集体+公司+农户”等运营组织模式，激发乡村内生动力。\n“成都乡村旅游不缺流量，缺的是将流量转化为消费的新场景。”成都市文化广电旅游局相关负责人介绍，作为全国最早发展农家乐的城市，成都乡村旅游曾以“吃农家饭、住农家屋”的1.0模式引领全国，但随着消费需求升级，传统模式已难以满足游客对沉浸式体验、文化共鸣和品质服务的期待。因此，《方案》的出台，正是为了实现文旅融合与乡村振兴的“双赢”，推动乡村旅游从“低客单价、高流量”向“高附加值、可持续”转型。",

    "text": "The Israeli prime minister's remarks come amid reports that the Biden administration is spearheading a new diplomatic effort to end the fighting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Jerusalem will not halt its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon until the 60,000-plus evacuated Israelis can safely return to their homes in the north. “I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing: We are determined to return our residents in the north to their homes safely,” he said in a video released by his office on Wednesday night. “We are inflicting blows on Hezbollah that it could not imagine. We do it with power, and we do it with ruse. I promise you one thing—we will not rest until they come home,” the premier’s succinct statement added. ‘Putting your country in danger’ His remarks came amid reports that the Biden administration is spearheading a new diplomatic effort to end the fighting in Lebanon and with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, connecting both war fronts as part of a single initiative. The deal is currently being hammered out on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Reuters said, citing Lebanese officials, Western diplomats, a source briefed on the negotiations, and an expert source said to be “familiar with the thinking” of Hezbollah terrorists. U.S. President Joe Biden told ABC’s “The View” on Wednesday morning that his administration believes that all-out war involving Iran’s terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East can still be prevented with a deal. “An all-out war is possible, but I think there’s also the opportunity—we’re still in play to have a settlement that can fundamentally change the whole region,” he said, adding that there also needs to be a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The diplomatic talks came as Israeli military commanders revealed that the country was preparing for a possible [ground invasion](https://www.jns.org/idf-northern-command-chief-hints-at-possible-ground-op-in-lebanon/) of Southern Lebanon to remove the threat posed by Iranian-backed Hezbollah. On Tuesday, Netanyahu had urged [civilians in Lebanon](https://www.jns.org/idf-fighting-hezbollah-terrorists-not-lebanon-netanyahu-emphasizes/) to revolt against Hezbollah’s grip on the country while warning that the Jewish state will not hesitate to strike any infrastructure used by the terror organization. Hezbollah is “putting your country in danger,” said Netanyahu, urging Lebanese to “free yourselves from Nasrallah’s grip, for your own good.” The Israeli leader stated on Monday that the [Israel Defense Forces](https://www.jns.org/netanyahu-we-are-changing-the-balance-of-power-with-hezbollah/) is “changing the security balance, the balance of power in the north. “For those who have not yet understood, I want to clarify Israel’s policy,” the premier said following a situational assessment with senior security officials at IDF headquarters in central Tel Aviv. “We do not wait for a threat; we anticipate it. Everywhere, in every sector, at any time. “We are destroying thousands of missiles and rockets that are directed at Israel’s cities and citizens,” the Israeli leader said in the video recording.",

    "text": "Silver Spring, MD (December 19, 2024) – A pedestrian was involved in a collision at the intersection of Bel Pre Rd and Georgia Ave late Thursday afternoon, causing significant disruptions and prompting a swift emergency response.\nEmergency responders, including paramedics and fire crews, were dispatched to the scene to provide care for the injured pedestrian. The incident occurred at a busy intersection known for high traffic, although details about the vehicle involved remain limited. The pedestrian sustained injuries and was transported to a local hospital for further treatment.\nAuthorities from the Montgomery County Police Department are investigating the circumstances surrounding the collision, including potential contributing factors. Traffic was rerouted in the area while officials worked to clear the scene. Our thoughts are with the injured individual, and we hope for their swift recovery.\nPedestrian Accidents in Maryland Pedestrian accidents remain a significant concern in Maryland, particularly in densely populated areas like Silver Spring. Intersections such as Bel Pre Rd and Georgia Ave often see high foot traffic alongside vehicular movement, increasing the risk of collisions. Data from the Maryland Department of Transportation indicates a rise in pedestrian-involved incidents in urban regions, prompting calls for improved safety measures.\nPedestrians are among the most vulnerable road users, often sustaining severe injuries in accidents. In many cases, the lack of adequate crosswalks, speeding, or distracted driving are contributing factors. Residents are encouraged to prioritize safety by using designated crosswalks and adhering to traffic signals, while drivers must remain vigilant, especially in areas frequented by pedestrians.\nIf you or someone you know has been involved in a pedestrian accident, it’s crucial to understand your rights and the steps to take following such incidents. Seeking medical attention and documenting the scene are essential, as is consulting with professionals who can guide you through insurance claims and potential legal actions.\nFor more information or to receive help after an accident, contact Local Accident Reports.",

    "title": "Namibia optimistic about new HIV-prevention injection: Lenacapavir shows 100% effectiveness in clinical trials - News - The Namibian",
    "text": "The Ministry of Health and Social Services is optimistic about a new HIV-AIDS preventative jab, which is currently on trial in a few African countries. The injection, a pre-exposure prophylaxis (lenacapavir), is in its second phase study and has so far shown positive signs, with the potential to help both those living with HIV-AIDS and cushioning those who are not infected. In a recent article published by the University Cape Town, Linda-Gail Bekker, a professor of medicine and deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, says clinical trials in South Africa and Uganda have shown that a twice-yearly injection of the new jab gives young women total protection against HIV infection. The trial tested whether the six-month injection of lenacapavir would provide better protection against HIV infection than two other medicines – both daily pills. All three medications are pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) medicines. Health minister Kalumbi Shangula yesterday told Desert Radio that the pilot study has confirmed the injection’s effectiveness. This marks a significant milestone in the ongoing fight against HIV-AIDS, he said. “Medicine is not static, it is evolving all the time. And the world is faced with many health challenges, and medical scientists are always at work to see how best to deal with those challenges. “The latest pilot study on the prevention of HIV by using a preventive vaccination, so to say, has yielded some positive results, which are quite encouraging,” Shangula said. He said the world has been faced with the HIV challenge for many years now, and many medical interventions have been discovered. “Most of them, are yielding positive results, including here in Namibia. The measures which we have put in place are actually giving us the encouraging result and that we have been able to bring HIV under control,” he said. Bekker says the Purpose 1 trial, with 5 000 participants, took place at three sites in Uganda and 25 sites in South Africa to test the efficacy of lenacapavir and two other medicines. She says lenacapavir interferes with the HIV capsid, a protein shell that protects HIV’s genetic material and enzymes needed for replication. “It is administered just under the skin once every six months. The randomised controlled trial, sponsored by drug developers Gilead Sciences, tested several things,” she says. “The first was whether a six-monthly injection of lenacapavir was safe and would provide better protection against HIV infection as PrEP for women between the ages of 16 and 25 years than Truvada F/TDF, a daily PrEP pill in wide use that has been available for more than a decade,” Bekker said. The trial also tested whether Descovy F/TAF, a newer daily pill, was as effective as F/TDF. In eastern and southern Africa, young women bear the brunt of new HIV infections. They also find a daily PrEP regimen challenging to maintain. During the randomised phase of the trial, none of the 2 134 women who received lenacapavir contracted HIV. This proved to be 100% efficient. Bekker said this breakthrough provides great hope that there is a proven, highly effective prevention tool to protect people against HIV. Catholic Aids Action spokesperson Tuuliky Amwele says the implementation of the new HIV jab would only help Namibia combating HIV if it is affordable. “It will mean a lot to us, as long as it is not expensive,” she says. Amwele says some people do not take their medication because they don’t have food to take it with. “So far, we are doing well. When it comes to HIV-AIDS, we maybe have just about 2% new infections,” she says. Stay informed with The Namibian – your source for credible journalism.

    "text": "The relationship between North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick and his 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson has been the talk of the town lately.\nThe topic has gotten so large that even ESPN’s Paul Finebaum jumped in and threw some criticism toward the couple, calling out Hudson big-time.\n “The bottom line, it’s pretty simple to understand,” Finebaum said. “Belichick’s trying to help her, trying to get her jobs, and she doesn’t seem to be qualified to do anything but get in the way.”\nThe comments came in reference to a recent CBS interview with Belichick, when Hudson jumped into the conversation to shut down any questions related to the start of their relationship together.\n“I agreed to speak with CBS Sunday Morning to promote my new book, ‘The Art of Winning – Lessons from My Life in Football,’” Belichick said in a statement. “Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of this book.”\nBelichick continued, saying that the interview drifted away from the book and that the agreement “was not honored during the interview.”\n“When we agreed to speak to Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview,” CBS said, responding to the accusation . “There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.”\nAs Hudson and Belichick continue to make headlines, the story is sure to continue with more juicy details about the relationship with a more than 50-year age gap.",

    "title": "Sensing delays: NYC Transit uses every-day phone technology to look for track defects",
    "text": "NYC trains may soon be faster and more efficient with the help of some innovative technology.\nFrom September 2024 to January 2025, the MTA partnered with Google Public Sector on a pilot program using Google Pixel smartphones designed to detect defects and problems more quickly — a move that could potentially avoid significant train delays for NYC Transit’s more than 4 million daily riders.\nIn what sounds like something straight out of a spy movie, the phones were placed under the carriages of four A train subway cars. The phones were placed inside plastic casings and mostly out of view of commuters, allowing subway staff to pick up quirky sounds, such as rattles or bangs, that could potentially point to a malfunction.\nThe pilot was an experiment conducted by the MTA and Google to determine whether everyday technology could be used as another resource to help keep tracks working and trains running.\nHaving some tech help could prove useful for inspection staff, who are charged with walking 665 miles of subway tracks to spot potential issues.\nBut listening, as well as walking, was at the center of the four-month experiment. During the run, staff listened to countless hours of subway noise to pluck out what could be the sound of a defect. With years on the job, recognizing the sound of a loose joint, bolt, or similar issue comes fairly easily.\nThe sound and vibration data is sent in real time to cloud-based systems, where artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms generate predictive insights. Track inspectors serve as “humans in the loop,” inspecting locations highlighted by the system and confirming whether there is an issue, providing feedback to continuously train the model.\nIncorporating artificial intelligence According to an article in Wired , which first reported on the pilot, NYC Transit and Google called the experimental technology “TrackInspect.” It suggests that collected audio, vibration and location data, used to train artificial intelligence prediction models, can be a resource to complement boots-on-the-ground inspections.\n“As more agencies adopt generative AI, Google Public Sector is excited to partner with innovative government leaders, like the leadership team at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,” Google Public Sector Vice President, Go-to-Market, Brent Mitchell, said. “The TrackInspect pilot program identified 92% of the defect locations found by track inspectors, illustrating that enhanced data analysis can help expedite problem identification and resolution to improve railway reliability.”\nThe experiment’s results were impressive. According to MTA officials, it identified 92% of defect locations that were later pinpointed by staff.\nIf fully implemented, the technology could benefit passengers by helping to prevent train delays caused by defects or similar issues.\n“By being able to detect early defects in the rails, it saves not just money but also time – for both crew members and riders,” NYC Transit president Demetrius Crichlow said. “This innovative program – which is the first of its kind – uses AI technology to not only make the ride smoother for customers but also make track inspector’s jobs safer by equipping them with more advanced tools.”\nDelays are all-too-familiar scenarios for subway straphangers. Some slowdowns are worse than others, such as the epic delay on multiple subway lines in Brooklyn on Dec. 11, 2024 from a power failure that left thousands of passengers stranded for hours .\nBut in addition to potentially shortening delays, the new technology would also be an extra resource for workers as “a way we could minimize the amount of work that’s done to identify those defects, and point inspectors in the right direction, so they can spend time fixing instead of identifying, and go directly there and do the work,” Crichlow, explained in the article.\nDigital upgrades planned for NYC Transit Whether or not the MTA plans to make the pilot program a full-time resource is still unknown.\nBut, the agency is planning for other tech updates for train signaling that will be paid for by congestion pricing revenue.\nThe MTA has said it plans to use “ Communications-Based Train Control ,” a form of wireless technology that keeps trains in constant contact with a centralized system that controls their movements.",
