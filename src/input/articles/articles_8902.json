    "text": "El gobierno del alcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York , Eric Adams , ha permitido que autoridades federales de inmigración operen en la isla Rikers para trabajar en investigaciones criminales relacionadas con pandillas y drogas en la cárcel más grande de la ciudad.\nSin embargo, grupos de derechos de los inmigrantes y críticos de Adams calificaron la orden ejecutiva del martes como un preocupante quid pro quo después de que los fiscales federales retiraran los cargos de corrupción contra el demócrata para que pudiera colaborar en las medidas del presidente republicano Donald Trump contra la inmigración ilegal.\nAdams anunció en febrero los planes para permitir que los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE , por sus siglas en inglés) reanuden operaciones en la cárcel, después de reunirse con Tom Homan, el zar fronterizo de Trump, aunque los detalles del acuerdo no se dieron a conocer hasta la orden del martes.",

    "text": "TRAVERSE CITY — Some small businesses in Northern Michigan got a sales boost, thanks to the holiday season. Retailers big and small, rely heavily on sales during the holiday shopping season, and Underground Toys, located at ‘The Commons’ in Traverse City, is no different. The toy store opened its doors about a month ago right before the Christmas shopping season started. Co-owner of Underground Toys, Caitlin Bowden, said they’ve seen plenty of foot traffic during and even after the holiday sales. And with many parents off work this week, the gloomy weather and kids with extra spending money from Christmas, the holiday sales continue to thrive. “They’re just looking for something to do, especially when it’s raining out. So, this is the perfect place to come. You know, go to all the shops, go to the restaurants. So, yeah, this week has been really nice because people are still enjoying themselves, are kind of in the holiday spirit there,” said Bowden. Bowden said some advantages to shopping locally at their store is kids have the ability to look and touch the toys in a less overwhelming setting and it’s a more fun shopping experience than buying online.",

    "text": "Brijesh Solanki, a 22-year-old state-level kabaddi player from Farana village, Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, died of rabies on 28 June 2025, weeks after being bitten by a puppy he rescued from a drain. Despite the bite, Brijesh did not receive an anti-rabies vaccine, mistaking the injury for a minor scratch.\nHis condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was denied treatment at several government hospitals before succumbing to the disease. Health officials have since launched a rabies awareness campaign in his village, while his family and the local community mourn his loss and demand accountability. The incident has sparked widespread discussion on the urgent need for public health awareness and systemic reforms.\nA Rising Star Lost to Negligence\nBrijesh was a gold medallist in state kabaddi championships and was preparing for the Pro Kabaddi League. Known for his compassion, he rescued a stray puppy in March, only to be bitten in the process. “He went to practice in the village and got a little bite from a dog after pulling it out of a drain. He did not pay attention to it,” said his brother, Sandeep Kumar.\nBrijesh’s coach, Praveen Kumar, added, “Brijesh mistook the pain in his arm for a regular kabaddi injury. The bite seemed minor and he didn’t think it was serious, so he didn’t take the vaccine.” Videos of Brijesh’s final days, showing him in severe pain and suffering classic rabies symptoms like hydrophobia, have circulated widely, highlighting the tragedy of his preventable death.\nSystemic Gaps and Community Response\nAfter Brijesh began showing symptoms such as numbness and fear of water, his family sought help at multiple hospitals in Khurja, Aligarh, and Delhi, but were reportedly denied admission. Only in Noida was rabies suspected, but by then, it was too late.\nSandeep Kumar, Brijesh’s brother, explained that Brijesh suddenly developed a fear of water and began showing symptoms consistent with rabies. The family sought help at government hospitals in Khurja, Aligarh, and even Delhi, but they were allegedly denied treatment at each facility. It was only after reaching a hospital in Noida that doctors identified rabies as the likely cause of Brijesh’s condition. Sadly, Brijesh passed away while the family was transporting him to a faith healer in Mathura\nBrijesh died while being taken to a faith healer in Mathura. The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sunil Kumar Dohre, urged, “People should get themselves examined at a government hospital in case of any dog, monkey or other animal bite.” In response, health officials vaccinated 29 villagers and initiated a rabies awareness drive. The entire village gathered to bid farewell to Brijesh, whose death has left the sports community in shock and grief.\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective\nBrijesh Solanki’s story is a stark reminder of the urgent need for public health awareness, timely medical intervention, and empathy in our communities.\nHis selfless act of kindness should have been met with support, not tragedy. We must foster a culture where no one dismisses animal bites as trivial, and where healthcare systems respond swiftly and compassionately.",

    "title": "Crafting Resilience: 10 Key Factors in Creating a Robust Contingency Plan for Your Company",
    "text": "Every business faces its own challenges and surprises. A strong contingency plan can make the difference between stumbling and standing strong.\nThis article dives into ten key factors to keep in mind when preparing your business for the unexpected. Using advice from industry experts, we explain key strategies to ensure your operations are resilient, your team is ready, and your future is secure.\nWhy Does Resilience Matter in the Workplace?\nResilience in the workplace helps teams power through tough times into growth phases. It transforms a group of individuals into a unified force capable of pivoting quickly and effectively, no matter the challenge.\nJim Purcell from Returns On Wellbeing Institute, LLC, noted. “Resilience enables employees to protect against negative experiences which otherwise could be paralyzing. And it helps employees maintain emotional balance during the adversity we’re experiencing today and reduces the likelihood of debilitating stress or depression.”\nFostering resilience means building a culture where every setback is a setup for a comeback. This value nurtures an atmosphere where innovation flourishes, people feel genuinely supported, and the business thrives, even in adversity.\nHow Does a Contingency Plan Enhance Resilience?\nA contingency plan is an important component for navigating unexpected challenges. It outlines clear actions a business can take to ensure operations continue smoothly past disruptions, providing a roadmap for rapid adaptation and recovery.\n“A contingency plan is essentially a safety net,” said Titania Jordan, CMO of Bark Technologies, a company known for the Bark Phone, a\nkids phone with built-in safety features. “When challenges arise, it’s the blueprint that keeps operations running, minimizing their impact and ensuring progress doesn’t stall.”\nEmbedding a mindful plan into a company’s strategy enhances resilience, empowering teams to handle crises with confidence. Contingency plans transform potential disruptions from major setbacks into manageable events, promoting a culture of readiness and adaptability.\nWhat Are the Core Elements of a Robust Contingency Plan?\nCrafting a contingency plan that stands the test of time and uncertainty involves more than just wishful thinking — it requires strategic foresight, meticulous planning, and a clear understanding of what makes your business tick. Here are 10 core elements to consider:\n1. Start With a Comprehensive Risk Assessment\nKickstarting with a thorough risk assessment sets the stage. Instead of guesswork, it’s a detailed analysis of what could go wrong and how it might affect your operations.\n“Every risk assessment is a deep dive into the ‘what ifs’ that many employees prefer to avoid, but it’s important for resilience,” explained Andrew Chen, Chief Product Officer of CommentSold, a company that specializes in\nShopify live selling. “Identifying these risks early on equips businesses to handle them with precision if they ever turn into reality.”\nA meticulous risk assessment highlights potential threats and prioritizes them based on their impact and likelihood. This approach ensures that your contingency plan is targeted and tailored to your business’s unique landscape instead of being a blanket strategy.\n2. Identify Critical Business Functions\nNext, you need to understand which functions are vital for your business’s survival. It’s about asking, “What are the non-negotiables for keeping the lights on?”\nSaad Alam, CEO and Co-Founder of\nHone Health, emphasized, “Focusing on these important areas guarantees that you safeguard what’s indispensable, ensuring your operations can endure any challenge.”\nIdentifying these critical business functions goes beyond protection, making sure that your business continues to serve its customers and maintain its market presence in times of crisis.\n3. Develop a Communication Strategy\nEstablishing who needs to know what, when, and how helps ensure that misinformation doesn’t compound any existing issues. A strategic communication plan outlines protocols for internal and external messaging, keeping all stakeholders informed and aligned.\nSam Emara, CEO of\nFoxy AI, said, “Crafting a clear and concise communication strategy underscores any contingency plan’s success. This way, everyone involved understands their role and the steps they need to take, minimizing panic and confusion.”\nBy prioritizing transparency and consistency, a communication strategy manages expectations and maintains trust. Whether you’re updating employees on the next steps or informing customers about how operations are affected, timely and honest communication reinforces stability and confidence across the board.\n4. Allocate Resources for Quick Response\nHaving resources ready at a moment’s notice can significantly reduce the time it takes to respond to a crisis. This concept includes having physical resources like emergency supplies and financial resources to cover unexpected costs. Planning how to allocate these resources before the unexpected hits means you can act immediately, reducing the impact on your operations.\nBrianna Bitton, Co-Founder and CEO of\nO Positiv, pointed out, “Quick access to pre-allocated resources allows you to respond to emergencies rapidly, mitigating potential damages and keeping your core functions intact.”\nEffective resource allocation involves understanding what you might need in various scenarios and ensuring those resources can be mobilized quickly. In addition to having funds or supplies on hand, you should know how to deploy them efficiently to address immediate needs. In doing so, your business remains operational, and you minimize the crisis’s impact on stakeholders.\n5. Establish Recovery Procedures\nRecovery goes beyond your initial response to a crisis. It involves steps to return to normal operations while minimizing the long-term impact on your business. Setting clear recovery procedures puts a roadmap in place for navigating out of crisis mode and back to business as usual.\nJustin Soleimani, Co-Founder of\nTumble, emphasized, “Recovery procedures lay down the steps to bounce back with minimal disruption to your services and client relationships.”\nFocusing on recovery means having a plan that covers not just the immediate aftermath but also the longer-term strategies for full operational recovery. You’re developing resilience, learning from the event, and emerging stronger than ever.\n6. Conduct Drills and Training\nTheoretical plans need practical testing. Conducting drills and training sessions ensures everyone knows their role and how to execute the plan under pressure. This practice builds confidence among team members and identifies any gaps or areas for improvement in the plan.\n“Drills transform your contingency plan from paper to practice, ensuring your team is both prepared and proficient,” said Travis Mydock,\nDUI lawyer St. Augustine, FL of Mydock Law.\nDrills and training embed a contingency plan into your company culture. They make resilience and preparedness part of the daily operations so that when the unforeseen occurs, your response is swift, coordinated, and effective.\n7. Regular Plan Reviews and Updates\nThe business environment is constantly changing, and so are the potential risks to your business. Regularly reviewing and updating the contingency plan helps it remain relevant and effective against new threats. Consider revisiting risk assessments, communication strategies, and recovery procedures to reflect your current reality.\n“An updated contingency plan is a live document that grows with your company,” noted Andrew Meyer, CEO of\nArbor. “Staying ahead means regularly reassessing your strategies and making necessary adjustments.”\nThis key factor is about adaptability: Ensure your plan evolves with your business, incorporating lessons learned from drills, actual events, and changes in the business landscape or operations.\n8. Collaborate With External Agencies\nCollaboration with external agencies — such as local emergency services, government bodies, and industry partners — can enhance your contingency plan’s effectiveness. Establishing connections and understanding mutual support capabilities before the unexpected happens ensures smoother coordination during emergencies.\n“Working alongside external agencies strengthens your preparedness framework, bringing in expertise and resources beyond your immediate reach,” stated Max Baecker, President of American Hartford Gold, a company that helps customers invest in and\nbuy gold.\nIntegrating with external partners means you’re not alone when navigating crises. Their support can offer additional insights, aid, and a broader perspective on managing emergencies, ensuring a more comprehensive response strategy.\n9. Secure Data and IT Infrastructure\nCyber threats or system failures can cripple your business operations in our increasingly technological world. Including cybersecurity measures and IT disaster recovery plans in your contingency planning safeguards your business’s digital heartbeat.\nAsker A Ahmed, Director of\niProcess Global Research, advised, “Prioritizing the security of your data and IT systems is non-negotiable. It’s the foundation upon which your business operations rest.”\nMaking sure you back up your data and your systems are resilient against attacks means that even in the face of IT crises, your business can continue to operate without significant loss of data or functionality.\n10. Employee Well-being and Support\nProviding support structures, such as counseling services and clear communication about job security, can mitigate the emotional and psychological impact of a crisis on employees.\nA contingency plan that includes employee support recognizes that your team is your greatest asset. Supporting them through crises not only aids in quicker recovery but also builds a stronger, more cohesive company culture capable of withstanding future challenges.\nBuilding Towards a Resilient Future\nThe journey to crafting a robust contingency plan is pivotal in arming your organization against the unexpected. It’s about more than just survival; it’s a strategic advantage that positions you to seize opportunities when they arise, especially when others might be floundering.\nMartin Reeves, Chairman of BCG Henderson Institute, noted, “Resilience is not merely an operational consideration — it’s a potential strategic advantage that enables companies to capitalize on opportunities when competitors are least prepared.”\nEmbrace these key factors, and set your business on a path to resilience and sustained growth.",

    "title": "Papa Francisco: momentos en los que ha ayudado a la paz de Colombia, cese al fuego con el ELN y FARC",
    "text": "El papa Francisco ha sido uno de los más firmes defensores de la paz de Colombia, por lo que no sorprende que ese fuera el tema principal en el encuentro que tuvo el viernes con el presidente Gustavo Petro. El anuncio principal fue la postulación que el mandatario hizo para que el Estado del Vaticano pueda ser sede de una de las rondas de negociaciones que el Gobierno lleva con el ELN. Todavía no se sabe si esa postulación pueda ser o no posible, especialmente porque desde la delegación del Gobierno en ese proceso se ha insistido en que la mesa de diálogos debe trasladarse a Colombia. Pero la idea está sustentada en que tanto Colombia como los esfuerzos de paz de diferentes gobiernos han estado presentes en la agenda del papa, incluso desde antes de la firma del Acuerdo de Paz de 2016. En contexto: ¿Es viable que el Vaticano sea sede de una de las rondas de diálogos con el ELN? Además, esa guerrilla —que está a punto de cumplir 60 años de fundación— tiene en sus raíces una profunda influencia religiosa. El ELN tiene en su ADN la herencia de la Revolución Cubana y la participación del cura colombiano Camilo Torres —y la teología de la liberación del que era exponente— conjuró la unión entre la religión y las ideas marxistas. En las últimas semanas, Colombia había estado entre las oraciones del pontífice. El domingo pasado rezó por las 36 personas que murieron en el derrumbe en Chocó y el 7 de enero, durante el rezo dominical del Ángelus, el papa pidió la liberación de todos los secuestrados del país. “Los invito a unirse a mi plegaria para la liberación sin condiciones de todas las personas actualmente secuestradas en Colombia”, dijo. Las palabras se dieron justo después de que el ELN y la disidencia de las antiguas FARC, conocida como Estado Mayor Central (EMC), anunciaran la suspensión de los secuestros con fines extorsivos, pero también cuando se confirmaba el secuestro de Jefferson Murillo, registrador delegado en Chocó, y del que desde el pasado 6 de enero se desconoce su paradero. Un mes antes, el 14 de diciembre, sostuvo una reunión con la vicepresidenta Francia Márquez, también en el Vaticano, en la que habló de la paz y de la reparación de afrodescendientes e indígenas. “Le manda a Colombia un mensaje de amor, alegría y esperanza”, dijo Márquez, quien agregó que “nos invita a seguir trabajando de manera incansable por lograr la paz, la justicia social y la dignidad para todos los colombianos y colombianas”. Además: Así nació el Eln, la última guerrilla de Colombia, que hoy negocia la paz El papa Francisco, primer latinoamericano en conseguir esa dignidad, es también una figura importante para el ELN. Fue por el pontífice que se logró uno de los hitos más relevantes con esa guerrilla: el cese al fuego de 101 días, que entró en vigor el 1° de octubre de 2017, durante el gobierno de Juan Manuel Santos. Era la primera vez en 54 años de conflicto que se daba un hecho de esa magnitud, que fue descrito como el “primer milagro del papa”. Esa acción, que ya se sobrepasó con el alto al fuego de 180 días que esa guerrilla lleva con este Gobierno, estuvo motivada por el viaje que hizo el papa a Colombia, pero con un trasfondo aún más especial y que mostró su interés por el país. Esa visita fue parte de la promesa que hizo si se firmaba el Acuerdo de Paz con las FARC. “Prometo que cuando el Acuerdo sea blindado por el plebiscito y por el acompañamiento internacional iré a Colombia a enseñar sobre paz”, aseguró el máximo jerarca católico. En su momento, el Gobierno reconoció que esa visita había sido fundamental para adelantar el cese. “El mensaje del papa ha llegado profundamente a la mesa de negociaciones, desde hace dos meses estamos hablando de ello”, señaló Juan Camilo Restrepo, entonces jefe negociador del Gobierno. Después de eso, el papa Francisco nombró a su amigo personal Luis Mariano Montemayor como nuncio apostólico en Colombia, es decir, como su representante en el país, cargo que tuvo hasta el año pasado. Le puede interesar: Las pullas del Gobierno Petro al ELN a pocos días del nuevo ciclo de diálogos en Cuba La misión que le encargó el sumo pontífice a Montemayor fue clara: “Le repetiré las mismas palabras que él me dijo: ‘Me he empeñado por la paz en Colombia y sigo empeñado en la paz de Colombia’. Esa es mi misión, venir aquí, no a decirles a los colombianos qué hacer, sino acompañarlos y ayudarlos a que encuentren”, afirmó a este diario en junio de 2019. En esa misma entrevista, monseñor Montemayor dijo que tenía contactos directos con el ELN, que les había hecho la exigencia de dejar el secuestro y que estaba dispuesto a ser un facilitador en ese diálogo. Además, monseñor Montemayor fue una de las personas que participaron en 2021 en acercamientos entre el ELN y el gobierno de Iván Duque para tratar de destrabar el proceso tras el atentado perpetrado por esa guerrilla, el 17 de enero de 2019, en la Escuela General Santander en Bogotá y donde murieron 22 personas. Durante todo 2021, las reuniones convocadas se hicieron en la oficina de la Nunciatura y fueron convocadas por el mismo monseñor Montemayor, el padre Darío Echeverri, secretario de la Comisión de Conciliación Nacional; Carlos Ruiz, jefe de la Misión de Verificación de la ONU, y Raúl Rosende, jefe adjunto de esa oficina de la ONU. Otras acciones del papa incluyeron incluso mediar entre la pelea de los expresidentes Juan Manuel Santos y Álvaro Uribe, que se había hecho aún más dura tras la votación de 2016 del plebiscito por el Acuerdo de Paz, en el que ganó el No. En diciembre de ese año el jerarca los congregó en la Santa Sede para su reconciliación. El resultado no fue milagroso, y ambos líderes profundizaron sus diferencias. El pontífice ya había tenido otro encuentro con Petro en febrero de 2022, cuando era candidato presidencial. En esa reunión conversaron sobre la búsqueda de una solución a la violencia en Colombia. Con la reciente visita de Petro, la primera que hace como mandatario, se afianza el apoyo de la Iglesia católica a la paz del país. Bien sea por su sangre latinoamericana o por la convicción propia de su dignidad como el máximo jerarca de la Iglesia católica, o por una mezcla de ambas cosas, el papa Francisco es y ha sido un aliado en la búsqueda de la paz de Colombia.",

    "title": "Michelle Funk, OMS: \"No existe suficiente investigación sobre los factores psicológicos y sociales de la salud mental\"",
    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente Michelle Funk es la máxima responsable de Salud Mental de la OMS. En esta entrevista concedida a EL PERIÓDICO -en un momento de la visita de Funk a Barcelona, invitada por la Fundación Hospitalarias y Sant Joan de Déu-, reclama que la lucha por la salud mental tenga en cuenta aspectos sociales, pide no basar la mirada solo en tratamientos farmacológicos y señala avances pero insuficiencias, en un combate por la mejora de la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos en todo el mundo. Pone buena nota a Catalunya e insiste en señalar factores como la vivienda o colectivos como los jóvenes, en el trabajo por una mejor salud emocional.\n-Hace diez años usted denunció que \"los derechos humanos de las personas con problemas de salud mental en el mundo no son respetados\". Diez años después, ¿hemos mejorado?\n-Diez años después podemos decir que las condiciones de las personas con problemas de salud mental, tanto en los servicios de salud como en la vida comunitaria, están en la misma situación. Sus derechos no están siendo respetados. Pero ha habido alguna evolución. Hay más conciencia de la necesidad de respetar estos derechos. Hay más conciencia al más alto nivel político en los países. No es una cuestión uniforme. En algunos lugares ha habido mejoras, en otros todavía no.\n-¿Por qué esta dificultad?\n-Ha habido iniciativas para mejorar la comprensión, luchar contra la discriminación, mejorar lo que debe ser respetado en términos de derechos humanos. Pero todavía no se ha agendado suficientemente todavía, entre los países y dentro de los países. Y es una prioridad número uno porque todavía tenemos que cambiar mentalidades si queremos ver un cambio sostenible. No está acelerándose como quisiéremos.\nLos problemas seguirán existiendo, la cuestión es como los afrontamos desde una mirada holística para conseguir mejores resultados Michelle Funk\n— Responsable de Política, Derecho y Derechos Humanos del Departamento de Salud Mental y adicciones de la OMS\n-¿Es una lucha global?\n-Los problemas de salud mental seguirán existiendo, pero la cuestión es como los afrontamos desde una mirada holística para conseguir los mejores resultados, y esto no está sucediendo de forma consistente, se da en algunos sistemas y no en otros.\n-Aquí se comenta a menudo que la salud mental es la hermana pobre del sistema de sal... ¿Está de acuerdo?\n-Absolutamente. Ha habido mucha discusión sobre los tratamientos y aproximaciones a la salud mental, y ha habido acciones para cambiar y mejorar pero no se están ofreciendo los recursos necesarios. Hay muchas cosas que sí se pueden mejorar sin dinero pero se necesitan más recursos humanos y recursos financieros.\nLa investigación en salud mental consigue un gran retorno, a nivel social, de productividad, en las vidas humanas Michelle Funk\n— Responsable de Política, Derecho y Derechos Humanos del Departamento de Salud Mental de la OMS\n¿Por qué no sucede? Siempre hay una lucha por los recursos, hay una gran competición por los recursos. Por encima de todo, todavía hay discriminación. Existe una falta de conciencia, y la mentalidad de que deberíamos usar los recursos a otras áreas porque habrá más retorno inversor... En realidad, hay muchos datos que demuestran que la investigación en salud mental consigue un gran retorno, a nivel social, de productividad, en las vidas humanas.\nMichelle Funk, tras la entrevista. / MANU MITRU.\n-Hablando de investigación. ¿Cree que está centrada en la cuestión biológica? ¿Deberían estudiarse más los factores psicológicos y sociales?\n-No existe suficiente investigación sobre los factores psicológicos, sociales, en estilos de vida y condiciones económicas, para mejorar la salud mental. Debe haber más investigación en este sentido. La investigación biológica ha dominado el escenario. Es difícil cambiar lo que ha estado sucediendo durante los últimos años, incluso si se ve que ha habido investigaciones que no funcionan, que no es suficiente para cambiar la situación. Has de mostrar las evidencias para cambiar las políticas y demostrar que vale la pena este otro tipo de investigación, pero estas investigaciones no se han llevado a cabo. Eso lo hace más difícil.\n-Catalunya y España están a la cabeza en fármacos, especialmente en casos neurológicos y de estrés. Los gobiernos admiten que es una sobremedicación. ¿Qué opina sobre este problema farmacológico?\n-Estoy de acuerdo con estos gobiernos. Son tratamientos que muchas veces requieren una respuesta holística. El problema, por ejemplo, son los efectos secundarios de los antidepresivos, en especial cuanto más tiempo se usan, más difíciles son de dejar y entonces se generan otros síntomas. Necesitamos, definitivamente, afrontar la medicalización y los tratamientos biológicos. No significa que no sean de ayuda para las personas. No es lo que estoy diciendo, que quede claro. Pero para mucha gente no es la única aproximación adecuada.\n-¿Qué otros tratamientos son también adecuados?\nLos tratamientos sobre el estilo de vida son superimportantes: el ejercicio físico, la dieta, diferentes maneras de manejar el estrés, ir a la naturaleza. Hay intervenciones con evidencia demostrada, para estrés, depresión. Y hay intervenciones psicológicas efectivas y tenemos evidencia de ello. O las intervenciones con las familias, y mirar las dinámicas familiares. O las condiciones económicas, las dificultades emocionales de no tener acceso a un trabajo, no tener dinero para la familia... La intervención depende de cada persona. Necesitamos hacer una valoración holística de cada persona: qué les pasa, qué dicen que les pasa, están sufriendo discriminación, que pasa en su vida que debe ser atendido.\n-¿Qué opina de la idea de escuchar más y atender más lo que las personas que sufren dicen y quieren, como prioridad?\n-Hay que cambiar la actitud, en todo el mundo. Como seres humanos, tenemos que hablar para entender, en una interacción normal. Pero cuando se profesionaliza, no hay tanto contacto humano. Hay una profesionalización en la interacción.\n-¿Qué opina del estrés, la competitividad, el individualismo, las redes sociales... como factores para entender el incremento de los problemas de salud mental?\n-Mucho de ello ha contribuido a los problemas pero es un conjunto de factores: las redes sociales pueden ser útiles para los niños dependiendo de cómo se usen, o para otras personas porque permite conexiones. Pero sí, las circunstancias estresantes en la vida de las personas afectan a su salud mental.\n-¿Qué causas cree que hay detrás del incremento de los problemas de salud mental entre los jóvenes? Ya asumimos que no hay una respuesta fácil...\n-El covid fue un gran golpe para la salud mental de los jóvenes, perturbó la educación, las redes sociales, y conexiones. Generó aislamiento, preocupación, fue un gran shock para las personas y especialmente para los jóvenes. Personas que no pudieron estudiar en la universidad durante un año... Mucha gente perdió oportunidades educativas...\nEl covid fue un gran golpe para la salud mental de los jóvenes, perturbó la educación, las redes sociales, y conexiones Michelle Funk\n— Responsable de Política, Derecho y Derechos Humanos del Departamento de Salud Mental y adicciones de la OMS\n-La falta de vivienda es el principal problema social. Tras algunos desahucios se producen incluso suicidios. ¿Qué opina de la relación entre el problema de la vivienda y la salud mental?\n-Es enorme. Definitivamente, hay una fuerte relación entre la falta de vivienda y el desarrollo de problemas de salud mental y además sabemos que mucha gente que viven en las calles también tiene problemas de salud mental.\n-Seguramente ha mejorado la lucha contra el estigma, pero probablemente a quien le dijeran que su nuevo vecino sufre esquizofrenia o un trastorno bipolar...no serían tan sensibles... ¿Estamos mejorando esta lucha contra los prejuicios?\n-Estamos todavía luchando y vamos a tener que seguir luchando durante mucho tiempo. Es una lucha en curso, permanente, porque cuando hay un gran acontecimiento y puede ser asociado con alguien que sufre un problema de salud mental, ambas cuestiones se confunden y generan miedo, cuando no están necesariamente relacionadas.\nla mayor parte de las personas con problemas de salud mental no son peligrosas, son mayoritariamente víctimas de violencia Michelle Funk\n— Responsable de Política, Derecho y Derechos Humanos del Departamento de Salud Mental y adicciones de la OMS\nEsto lleva a mucho miedo. Y hay que decir que la mayor parte de las personas con problemas de salud mental no son peligrosas ni violentas, son mayoritariamente víctimas de violencia que causantes de ella.\nMichelle Funk, tras la entrevista, en Barcelona. / MANU MITRU\n-¿Cómo lo está haciendo Catalunya con los Quality Rights, los indicadores de calidad en el servicio para mejorar la salud mental?\n-Lo está haciendo muy bien, he estado en un hospital, con 400 personas en un training . Están cambiando actitudes, políticas y protocolos y esto es excelente, necesitamos que suceda en cada hospital. Estoy muy impresionada por el nivel de entusiasmo, las ganas de cambio. Es un buen indicador hacia el futuro.\n-Finalmente, ¿Por qué está usted en esta lucha, hay alguna motivación personal? ¿Qué gana con todo ello?\n-Veo lo que provocan los problemas en la gente, me hace sentir increíblemente triste y molesta porque no debería ser así. Esto me lleva a que las condiciones de las personas deberían ser mejores, en especial las personas con problemas de salud mental. Los profesionales, las familias, las comunidades todos se beneficiarían del cambio. Y está demostrado que se puede cambiar y conseguir grandes diferencias. Esto es lo que me motiva.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo",

    "title": "Türkiye Spearheads Ukraine Infrastructure Rebuild Amid Diplomatic Ties Strengthening",
    "text": "In a significant move towards rebuilding war-torn Ukraine, Turkish construction giants Dogus Construction and Onur Group have taken the helm in repairing critical infrastructure, including bridges and airports, while also planning to construct mobile hospitals. This initiative aligns with Türkiye's broader strategy to foster stronger diplomatic and economic relations with Ukraine, amidst ongoing discussions on simplifying customs procedures and establishing a manufacturing presence in the country.\nTürkiye's Role in Ukraine's Reconstruction Efforts\nAmidst the backdrop of destruction brought about by conflict, Turkish firms have emerged as pivotal players in Ukraine's reconstruction saga. Reports indicate a concerted effort by foreign corporations, including those from Türkiye, to rejuvenate Ukraine's infrastructure, with an estimated cost pegged at €1 trillion by the European Investment Bank. Notably, Turkish companies have embarked on restoring bridges and roads, and are gearing up to rebuild the\nDnipro International Airport. The significance of these projects extends beyond physical reconstruction, symbolizing a beacon of hope for Ukraine's recovery and future resilience.\nStrengthening Diplomatic and Economic Ties\nParallel to the reconstruction efforts, Türkiye has been actively involved in diplomatic engagements aimed at supporting Ukraine. President Erdogan's readiness to host peace talks between Ukraine and Russia underscores Türkiye's commitment to regional stability and respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity. Furthermore, the establishment of a Baykar manufacturing plant in Ukraine and the simplification of customs procedures reflect a deepening of economic ties, poised to benefit both nations in the long term.\nFuture Prospects and Challenges\nThe road to Ukraine's revitalization is fraught with challenges, including fierce competition for contracts and the logistical complexities of rebuilding in a conflict zone. However, the involvement of Turkish firms, renowned for their expertise in navigating such adversities, offers a glimmer of hope. As Türkiye continues to expand its footprint in Ukraine, the international community watches closely, recognizing the potential for this collaboration to set a precedent for post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding efforts globally.\nThe unfolding narrative of Türkiye's involvement in Ukraine not only highlights a strategic partnership but also heralds a new era of international cooperation. As bridges are built and airports rise from the ashes, the foundation for a stronger, more resilient Ukraine is laid, with Türkiye playing a central role in its renaissance. This endeavor, while challenging, underscores the power of unity and shared vision in overcoming adversity and paving the way for a prosperous future.",
