We are all thrilled to open up the doors of our new location to this region of the city – as we have in every community where we have a Traders Point location – to be a place where people can experience the hope and the help that can be found in Jesus.\" About Traders Point Christian Church: Traders Point Christian Church is one church meeting in several locations around our city, breaking down any unnecessary barriers that keep people from Christ.

    "text": "O ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad, afirmou que o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva teve uma vitória muito importante com o acréscimo da carne na cesta básica zerada. As propostas da Fazenda e do grupo de trabalho da Câmara não contemplavam essa inclusão, que foi defendida sobretudo pela bancada do agronegócio. Um acordo durante a votação, incluindo a oposição, é que permitiu a medida.\n\"O presidente Lula teve sua vitória ontem, que é muito importante. O presidente Lula tinha feito manifestação pública de que a carne tinha de estar na cesta básica, porque, afinal de contas, o aceso à proteína animal tem de ser garantido a todos os brasileiros\", disse o ministro, em vídeo divulgado nas suas redes sociais e da primeira-dama, Janja Lula da Silva.\nHaddad disse que a medida foi viabilizada no Congresso por um acordo de liderança que envolveu todos os partidos. \"Mesmo o PL, que votou contra a reforma tributária. Eles estão fazendo uma campanha contra a reforma numa linha de retrocesso e não modernidade. Conseguimos vencer a oposição e colocamos a carne na cesta básica\", disse o ministro no vídeo.\nQuando o relator do projeto, Reginaldo Lopes (PT-MG), anunciou que acataria a inclusão da carne no parecer, o texto já havia sido votado e aprovado. Os parlamentares analisavam os destaques - emendas feitas no plenário que promovem alterações ao texto. Foi justamente o PL que sugeriu esse destaque para inclusão das carnes na cesta básica.\nHaddad ainda disse que o resultado da votação foi \"espetacular\". \"O Brasil teve um dia de glória ontem, um dia importantíssimo para a economia, não só do ponto de vista de desenvolvimento mas de justiça tributária, porque o pobre no Brasil é quem mais paga imposto proporcionalmente à renda e essa reforma começa a correção da injustiça histórica\", afirmou.\nHaddad diz que inclusão da carne na cesta básica zerada é vitória de Lula",

    "title": "Heartwarming tributes to Charlie Bird with music, memories and a few howls and whimpers – The Irish Times",
    "text": "And then the dog cried. A heart-melting moment in a memorial service with many lovely moments. Tiger Bird, rising to the big occasion and displaying a great nose for a good line. Just like his newshound master used to do. Timing is everything. One can imagine [Charlie Bird](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/charlie-bird/), from some other dimension, bellowing an approving, “That’s my boy!” before checking that the celestial cameraman got it for the evening news. The unscripted scene happened as Thursday’s memorial service for the former [RTÉ ](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/rte/)news correspondent was drawing to a close in Dublin’s Mansion House. Charlie’s wife, Claire, walked to the platform after listening to reflections and memories of her late husband from a succession of speakers. She stood beneath a giant screen showing photographs of Charlie cuddling an adorable white cockapoo – their beloved Tiger. She took a deep breath and, struggling to maintain composure, said she would speak from the heart about their years together, “but when you’re heartbroken it’s a very difficult task”. At that precise moment, her words were punctuated by a volley of anguished howls and urgent whimpers. It was Tiger, Charlie’s faithful companion during the dark days of his struggle with motor neuron disease – a personal tragedy that he turned into a courageous fundraising and public awareness campaign. Tiger, still there to give comfort. Hundreds of people in the round room caught their breath and exchanged astonished glances. Claire stepped away from the microphone and went to get Tiger. The crowd burst into applause. Returning to the platform, she scooped the little dog up into her arms and found the strength to continue. Earlier, at midday, family members and former RTÉ colleagues carried Charlie’s eco-friendly, woven water hyacinth coffin into the Mansion House’s historic Round Room, passing a guard of honour from the Clew Bay Pipe Band. The pipers, their black Glengarry hats folded and placed on the ground as a mark of respect, played Raglan Road. Inside the doors, members of LGBT groups formed a second guard of honour, dipping two Dublin Pride flags as the remains passed by. Charlie played a big part in the referendum campaign for marriage equality, leading to his book A Day in May, which was later made into a play. The memorial service was billed as “a celebration of the life of Charlie Bird” and the order of service listed Joe O’Brien, Charlie’s RTÉ colleague and friend of more than 40 years, as the “celebrant”. That raised a smile among the hacks. In their day, the two former correspondents would have been joint celebrants at the consecration of many’s the pint of stout. With all the unpleasantness of the past year, it was good for the hardworking hacks and newsroom middle-management – serving and retired – to get the chance to meet and reminisce and have a few chuckles without an Oireachtas committee demanding to see the receipts. RTÉ director general [Kevin Bakhurst](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/kevin-bakhurst/) was there along with new RTÉ chair [Terence O’Rourke](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/terence-o-rourke/). At any other time, the place would have been heaving with Government Ministers and the like, but they are abroad on St Patrick’s Day duty. Labour leader [Ivana Bacik](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/ivana-bacik/) paid her respects along with deputy [Aodhán Ó Ríordáin](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/aodhan-o-riordain/) while senator Timmy Dooley flew the Fianna Fáil flag alongside Lord Mayor and Mansion House resident, [Daithí de Róiste](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/daithi-de-roiste/). A large contingent from the National Union of Journalists was led by Irish Secretary, Séamus Dooley. We are not sure if they were hearing petitions/confessions from RTÉ employees on the way out. A crowd of about 400 – family, former colleagues and members of the public – gathered for the midday ceremony. Music was provided, magnificently, by Matt Molloy on the flute, fiddler Liam O’Connor, Kevin Conneff on the bodhrán and piper Seán Potts. At the outset, Charlie’s five grandchildren placed mementoes of his life at a table beside the flower-laden coffin. There was a family photo, two biographies, a Bruce Springsteen book, the wooden staff he used when climbing Croagh Patrick, a postcard painted by Joe Duffy and the rosary beads given to him by Daniel O’Donnell, which will be buried with him on Inis Oírr on the Aran Islands. His daughters Orla and Neasa spoke of their childhood memories of a wonderful, funny Dad with whom they had the best of times. They spoke of his courage in the face of his MND diagnosis and how it never faltered in those final days. Joe O’Brien recalled his “intelligent, kind and generous, cheeky, witty, honest and forthright” friend who had “boundless energy and a nose for news”. Another RTÉ stalwart, Sean O’Rourke, perhaps with an eye to the current controversies, spoke of how Charlie adored public service broadcasting and of his commitment to the highest journalist standards. “Those standards still endure and will endure.” [ [Charlie Bird obituary: One of Ireland’s best-known journalists for nearly 40 years](https://www.irishtimes.com/obituaries/2024/03/12/charlie-bird-obituary-one-of-irelands-best-known-journalists-for-nearly-40-years/) ] O’Rourke then had something of a Tony Blair/Princess Diana moment when the former Chief News Correspondent for RTÉ was more than that. “You were the People’s Correspondent.” And tributes from Charlie’s former news editor, Ray Burke, who told tales of his great friend’s globe-trotting newsgathering exploits and TV news editor, Dympna Moroney who recalled one incident when she drove the intrepid Bird to meet a shadowy contact in an underground car park. He told her: “If I’m not back in 20 minutes, first ring the newsroom and then ring the guards.” A poignant reflection was delivered by [Stardust ](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/stardust/)survivor and campaigner, Antoinette Keegan. She told of Charlie Bird’s unstinting support for the families seeking justice after the death of 48 loved ones in the nightclub fire in 1981. He was one of the first reporters on the scene. She knows that “Charlie, my mam and the 48 angels will guide us to justice for once and for all”. Words too from the Defence Forces Chief of Staff, Lt General Sean Clancy, who was a big part of the Climb with Charlie fundraiser on Croagh Patrick and from LGBT rights activist, Karl Hayden. One somewhat jarring note was the ban on photographs or filming at the service. Given Charlie’s life in front of the camera and his dedication to bringing pictures of the story to the public, photographers and news camera crews were left fuming outside the doors. [ [Charlie Bird – forever newsman, true friend and seeker of truth – hit the RTÉ newsroom like a thunderbolt](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2024/03/12/charlie-bird-forever-newsman-true-friend-and-seeker-of-truth-hit-the-rte-newsroom-like-a-thunderbolt/) ] There was a blessing from Fr Charlie McDonnell, the parish priest of Athenry – another friend. His wife Claire introduced a touching and heartwarming video of some special moments in their – and Tiger’s – life. “I love you, Bird, I’m going to miss you so much.” What with that, and a blast of Springsteen’s Land of Hope and Dreams followed by Kevin Conneff’s hauntingly beautiful rendition of the The Parting Glass, there was hardly a dry eye in the house. And then Daniel O’Donnell appeared on the screen, speaking from Australia. He sang Remember Me. The family stayed to allow people express their condolences and then waiters appeared with refreshments. As one retired RTÉ employee remarked after the service: “For all the great tributes about all the big stories he covered around the world, the last three years of Charlie’s life was his best story ever.” - Listen to our [Inside Politics Podcast](https://www.irishtimes.com/podcasts/inside-politics/)for the latest analysis and chat - Sign up for [push alerts](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/11/07/stay-informed-with-push-alerts-from-the-irish-times-delivered-straight-to-your-phone/)and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone - Find [The Irish Times on WhatsApp](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/10/27/find-the-irish-times-on-whatsapp-and-stay-up-to-date/)and stay up to date",

    "text": "Supreme Court In 2023: Top 10 Rulings That Impacted India Inc. These pivotal rulings have reverberated across boardrooms, legal circles, and the business landscape. The Supreme Court of India gave landmark rulings in 2023 that left an indelible mark on the country's corporate realm. From redefining insolvency laws to setting new precedents in arbitration law, from ruling on controversial tax issues to a contempt case against a coveted tribunal, here are 10 pivotal rulings that have reverberated across boardrooms, legal circles, and the business landscape, elucidating their profound impact on the nation's corporate fabric. Tax Clarity One of the biggest tax cases of this year was one where the top court a favourable tax rate to multinationals from Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands. The top court was dealing with the interpretation of the 'Most Favoured Nation' clause, contained in various Indian treaties, with countries that are members of the OECD. The multinationals had before the court that since French, Swiss, and Dutch treaties have the MFN clause, the beneficial 5% withholding rate in treaties with Slovenia, Lithuania and Colombia should apply to them as well. However, the apex court said that there is no \"automatic\" application of a lower tax rate under the MFN clause and that the beneficial rate will not apply unless a notification is issued to give it effect. Experts that this interpretation was not in good faith and that this might project India as a difficult nation for international trade and transactions. In its second major tax ruling, which came as a setback to telecom companies, the top court that payment of licence fee will be classified as capital expenditure and not revenue expenditure. The court explained that payment of an amount in installments does not convert the nature of a capital payment into a revenue payment. Prior to this ruling, telecom companies were treating the licence fee as an expense which was tax deductible. Pro-Arbitration Stance In a case which finally put to rest the controversy behind the validity of a deficiently stamped agreement containing an arbitration clause, a seven-judge bench of the top court that agreements that are not stamped or inadequately stamped are not rendered void ab initio and will be enforceable under law. The court said that non-stamping or inadequate stamping being a curable defect, any objection in relation to it would fall within the ambit of the arbitral tribunal. In another ruling, which is set to foster the Indian arbitration landscape, the top court has the group of companies doctrine, considering its utility in determining the intention of the parties in the context of complex transactions involving multiple parties and agreements. Providing much-needed clarity to the doctrine, the court has said that it is not necessary for a person or an entity to be a signatory to an arbitration agreement, in order to be bound by it. Experts this ruling with open arms, given that business transactions have been growing increasingly complex and involve multiple entities—some of which may not be signatories to the agreement. IBC Success One of the biggest IBC rulings came out in relation to the insolvency process pertaining to individuals and partnership firms. The case dealt primarily with the role of resolution professionals in relation to personal guarantors. It was the contention of the petitioners that resolution professionals have unfettered powers, as the IBC empowers them to exercise adjudicatory functions. Holding that a resolution professional does not exercise an adjudicatory role in relation to personal guarantors, the apex court [explained](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/ibc-does-not-suffer-from-manifest-arbitrariness-says-supreme-court) that the real adjudicatory process starts when the adjudicating authority either accepts or rejects the resolution professional's application to start the insolvency process—not at the stage when an application is made by the resolution professional to the authority. This ruling has paved the way for nearly 2,289 cases, with a default amount clocking nearly Rs 1.63 lakh crore to be taken up by the NCLTs. A decision from the top court the debate around the discretionary powers of insolvency courts to accept insolvency applications. The court said that once the NCLT is sure that a default pertaining to a financial debt has occurred, it has no choice but to accept the insolvency application. The court clarified that only when it can be proven that a debt is not due or is payable at some future date does the adjudicating authority have the discretion to reject the application. NCLAT Bench In Trouble In a first this year, a bench of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal was in wilful defiance of an order of the Supreme Court. The case pertained to an order passed in a matter concerning the annual general meeting of Finolex Cables Ltd. On Oct. 13, the top court directed the appellate tribunal not to pass an order in the matter until the final results of the AGM were published. However, the appellate tribunal proceeded to pronounce its order at 2 p.m., whereas the results of the AGM were declared at 2:40 p.m. According to the lawyers involved in the case, the top court's order was presented before the NCLAT bench, but to no avail. During the proceedings, the court that the manner in which the NCLAT had proceeded to deliver the judgement was unbecoming of a judicial tribunal. Dismayed at how the matter had unfolded, the top court went on to observe that the NCLTs and the NCLAT have gone to \"rot\". Fraud Account Classification In a major relief to borrowers, the top court [held](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/borrowers-must-be-heard-before-accounts-are-classified-as-fraud-says-supreme-court) that borrowers must be heard before their accounts are classified as ‘fraud’ by banks. The apex court held that classifying an account as fraud is akin to blacklisting the borrowers for being unworthy of availing credit, which has both civil and penal [consequences](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/borrowers-vs-banks-the-commercial-impact-of-supreme-court-ruling-on-fraud-tag). Therefore, the top court said, an opportunity to be heard must be provided before taking the action of classifying an account as fraudulent. Taxation On Online Betting Games In 2022, the GST department had sent a show cause notice to Gameskraft Technologies Pvt., which involved a demand of Rs 21,000 crore from the online gaming company for misclassification of its supply activity. The company had maintained that a tax rate of 18% is appropriate for a game of skill. The GST department, however, was of the view that the game should be subject to a 28% tax because, irrespective of the nature of the game—be it a game of skill or chance—the minute it is played with stakes, it amounts to betting or gambling. The department’s contention was rejected by the Karnataka High Court earlier this year, which [prompted](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/government-to-challenge-karnataka-high-courts-gameskraft-verdict-says-revenue-secretary) them to file an appeal before the top court. While granting a [stay](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/gameskraft-case-supreme-court-stays-karnataka-high-courts-ruling) to the department, the top court said that it does not want other high courts across the country to follow the Karnataka High Court's ruling. In essence, the rate of taxation that these online gaming companies will be subject to will depend on the apex court’s final ruling. The court is expected to come out with a verdict on this issue in 2024. Demonetisation Verdict In the biggest policy [verdict](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/law-and-policy/supreme-court-upholds-demonetisation-decision-by-a-41-majority) of this year, the top court upheld the government's demonetisation [decision](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/law-and-policy/supreme-court-demonetisation-decision-impact-on-policymaking). The court categorically held that there has to be great restraint in matters of economic policy and that it cannot supplant the wisdom of the executive with its own. The court iterated that there was a reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved by the government and that the decision cannot be set aside on the basis that objective was not achieved.

    "text": "Global aid organization's aliyah (immigration to Israel ) effort continues despite rise in global conflict\nJERUSALEM , April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- To mark Yom HaAliyah ( Aliyah Day ) 2024, an Israeli holiday which begins this year on the night of April 17 , the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (The Fellowship) is honoring its impact in helping Jews from around the world return to their homeland, Israel .\nIn 2023, The Fellowship helped more than 4,000 people make aliyah (immigrate to Israel ) from 35 countries around the world. Since its founding more than 40 years ago, The Fellowship has helped more than 770,000 Jews make aliyah from 50 different countries.\n\"One of the great points of pride for The Fellowship is helping fulfill biblical prophecy by bringing Jews home from 'the four corners of the earth,'\" said Yael Eckstein , the organization's President and CEO.\nAliyah is a cornerstone of the state of Israel , and is often a life-changing decision for Jews especially as they look to flee from the drastic rise in global anti-Semitism since the attacks of October 7 . In the final two months of 2023 alone, over 2,600 Jewish people immigrated to Israel .\n\"The fact that they want to make this journey even during a time of war in Israel shows how vital aliyah is. Many olim (immigrants) tell us that it's the fulfillment of a lifelong dream,\" Eckstein added.\nAliyah is a key pillar of the more than 2 million people the Fellowship helps annually. The organization supports olim both before and after their arrival in the Holy Land. In addition to arranging \"freedom flights,\" The Fellowship also provides klitah (resettlement) support to new olim , helping with immigration paperwork, food assistance, education and job training, and more.\n\"The heartwarming stories of Jews from around the world stepping off the plane and feeling an overwhelming sense of safety, of new beginning, of belonging , are countless,\" Eckstein said. \"Being able to help people start a new chapter of their lives in their biblical homeland is just one way The Fellowship's work brings much-needed light into the world in these dark times.\"\nAbout the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews\nFor more than 40 years, the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (The Fellowship) has been the leading non-profit building bridges between Christians and Jews, blessing Israel and the Jewish people around the world with humanitarian care and lifesaving aid.
