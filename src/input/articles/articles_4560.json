    "text": "RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat dared Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on his proposal of withdrawing orders on 'hijab', during the 'Sankeerthana Yatra', held as part of Hanuman Jayanti celebrations, in Srirangapatna taluk, Mandya district, on Sunday.\nThousands of Hanuman devotees participated in the Yatra that was launched by Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, at the Anjaneyaswamy temple, near Nimishamba temple, in Ganjam, in Srirangapatna taluk, on Sunday.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Prabhakar alleged that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is sowing seeds of differences among the people. Pointing out the CM's recent statement of proposing to withdraw the order on 'hijab', he said, \"The CM has spoken about lifting the ban on 'hijab'. Does he have the 'power' to do it\"?\nCommenting on the Muslim girl Bibi Muskan, who became popular after praising Allah at the educational institution in Mandya, Prabhakar said, \"If you want to say 'Allah hu Akbar', say it in your house or at the mosque. If you want to be here, you should chant 'Jai Sri Ram' \".\nThe RSS leader also alleged that Muskan was supported by Islam organisations and those who lauded Muskan had provided financial support to her.\n\"The girl (Muskan) has told of returning to college. Let her go to college if she has the courage\", Prabhakar challenged.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 24 December 2023, 08:13 IST)",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — Data from Environment Canada has confirmed what winter sport enthusiasts have known for a while — December was warm in British Columbia. Five communities in the province set or equalled temperature records for the month while the warm weather, combined with a lack of rain or snow, has done little to ease ongoing drought concerns. Meteorologist Brian Proctor said the mean temperature at Vancouver International Airport last month was 7 C, tying with 1939 as the city's warmest December on record since data started being collected in 1896. The mean temperature was 3.4 degrees higher than what is considered normal for the month. Proctor said Tuesday that warm weather records for December were also either set or tied in Victoria, Comox, Campbell River and Abbotsford. The month was also very dry, meaning there wasn't enough rain or snow to ease drought concerns in the province, he said. In the northeastern municipality of Chetwynd, for example, less than a millimetre of precipitation was recorded in December. The community usually sees about 19 millimetres. \"In general terms, it hasn't been enough to alleviate the long-standing drought,\" Proctor said. \"It's helped to sort of pull it back a little bit, but what we really do need, more than anything else, is we need snowpack. And we're not getting snowpack out of these kinds of systems at this point in time.\" The province's final drought update of the year, posted at the end of November, lists eight of B.C.'s 34 basins at the two highest levels of risk for adverse drought impacts. The northeast corner of B.C., which includes the Fort Nelson and Peace regions, remains at the highest level of drought where adverse impacts are almost certain. Proctor says the first full week of January is expected to get cooler with some snow possible at higher elevations This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 2, 2024. The Canadian Press Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said December wasn't warm enough to break records in British Columbia. In fact, Environment Canada now says multiple communities either broke or tied heat records.",
