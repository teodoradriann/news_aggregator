    "text": "LUBBOCK, Texas ( KCBD /Gray News) - A Texas couple celebrating decades together said that when they first met they just clicked.\nThe Gibsons say they have never thought about leaving one another in the 70 years they’ve been together, and now they’re celebrating their long-lasting vows with their entire family.\n“When we said ‘I do,’ we meant ‘I do,’” Pam Gibson said.\nPam Gibson and her husband, Bill Gibson, first met on a blind date, set up by Pam Gibson’s brother-in-law who was working with Bill Gibson.\n“He was quite a hunk when he come to the front door to get me,” Pam Gibson said.\nAfter their first date at the amusement park, Bill Gibson said it was love at first sight.\n“Oh, I knew she was the one. There wasn’t any question about it,” he said.\nBill Gibson later popped the question, and the two were married on Dec. 21, 1953.\nA few years after they got married, they started their own business, Gibson Plumbing. The two worked together for 35 years, and Bill Gibson said they never argued.\n“Everything’s special about her. I mean, we don’t criticize each other. We never have,” he said.\nAll the while, they balanced business with a growing family.\n“Our oldest son, we were married in December of 1953, and he was born in November of 1954, so we didn’t have much time to think about it,” Pam said.\nThey now have three kids, 11 grandchildren, 29 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. The “memaw” and “pepaw” even built a party house next door to host everyone for get-togethers.\nTheir son Scott Gibson said 70 years is truly momentous.\n“They’ve been a tremendous example. We haven’t always followed their example or their advice, you know, but they’re quite an example of commitment and something to really look up to,” he said.\nPam Gibson said there’s only one boss in the marriage and it’s Bill Gibson. She said she likes not holding that responsibility.\n“We’re best friends, and yes, I don’t know what I’d do without him. And I hope I never have to,” she said.\nPam Gibson said without God, they wouldn’t have made it all these years.\nIf they ever had a disagreement, they waited until the kids were in bed. And no matter what, they always chose to stick together.\n“Never once did I think about leaving him, and I’m sure he felt the same way with me. That wasn’t an option,” Pam Gibson said.\nSaturday, their whole family will celebrate the vows that have lasted 70 years.\n“We’re working for 75 now,” Pam said.\nCopyright 2023 KCBD via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "title": "Another Putin Ally Found Dead After Fall From Window | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "By Jim Thomas | Thursday, 28 December 2023 04:28 PM EST On Wednesday, Vladimir Egorov, a 46-year-old political ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was discovered lifeless after plummeting from a third-floor window in Tobolsk, Tyumen Oblast, according to Russian state media, the New York Post reported. Egorov, a United Russia party member and former Tobolsk City Duma deputy, died in the front yard of a residence, exhibiting \"no sign of criminal death on the body,\" sources disclosed. Reports suggest that Egorov might have experienced \"heart problems\" before the fatal fall, an assertion echoed by an unnamed source who remarked, \"One of the most likely reasons is heart problems.\" As is common in Russia, especially amid the conflict with Ukraine, heart-related issues are often cited in explaining untimely or suspicious deaths of public figures. Pathologists are awaiting official autopsy results to determine the precise cause of Egorov's demise. Authorities are actively investigating the circumstances surrounding Egorov's fall, indicating that the incident is not being ruled out as accidental. The deceased, a lawyer, faced a corruption scandal in 2016 that led to his departure from the city administration. Despite this setback, he reentered politics and amassed significant wealth, becoming one of Tobolsk's wealthiest local deputies with an income totaling about $100,500. Egorov, survived by a wife and two children, is the latest in a series of Putin allies whose deaths have raised suspicions. Notably, Lukoil tycoon Ravil Maganov, Russian defense official Marina Yankina, and sausage tycoon Pavel Antov, all linked to Putin, also died under mysterious circumstances, with window falls and or heart problems being cited as factors, according to Newsweek.

[Sign up for The Brief](https://www.texastribune.org/newsletters/the-brief/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=trib-ads-owned&utm_campaign=trib-marketing&utm_term=inline-CTA-brief), The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. DENTON — When Texas college students return to their campuses after the winter break, they’ll discover the lights are still off in their campuses’ diversity offices. That’s because a new law that outlaws such work at the state’s higher education institutions goes into effect, Jan. 1. Another 29 laws also will go into effect in the new year that aim to change the economy, tax codes and the criminal justice system. Many of the new laws seek to streamline tax codes and update property appraisal processes, while others touch on more unique issues like e-cigarette usage in minors and commemorative state license plates. Here are some of the laws: Dissolving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at public universities: [Senate Bill 17](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=SB17) requires public universities to end so-called diversity, equity and inclusion work. Universities will also be unable to offer training on diversity and inclusion for its faculty and staff, or require diversity statements in hiring processes. Universities must also confirm to the Legislature between legislative sessions that they are in full compliance. [ [As Texas bans diversity and equity offices at public colleges, Rice University’s inclusion efforts march on](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/10/25/texas-dei-ban-rice-university/)] While the law is set to go into effect Jan. 1, many of Texas’ public universities have already begun ramping down their DEI practices and programs after the governor’s chief of staff sent a memo [ in February](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/02/07/greg-abbott-diversity-equity-inclusion-illegal/) calling DEI hiring initiatives illegal. Since the law’s [ passing in May](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/27/texas-university-diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-bill-conference/), general counsels for the universities have released [varying levels](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/18/texas-am-dei-guidance/) of [guidance](https://www.utsystem.edu/sites/default/files/documents/publication/2023/sb17-guidance/ut-system-sb-17-policy-guidance-9-22-23.pdf) throughout the fall semester on how to continue to support a diverse student body while staying within the boundaries of the law. In addition to the dissolution of DEI offices, universities have also shut down university-led student support programs as concern mounts as to whether they also violate the law, but some colleges are looking for workarounds. The University of North Texas’ president Neal Smatresk announced in an email to students Dec. 1 that a new Center for Belonging and Engagement would be established to continue to promote inclusivity as the school’s multicultural center and pride alliance close. The law’s restrictions do not apply to class instruction, materials needed for federal grant applications or student organizations on campuses, but multiple university officials have said the law has made [hiring new faculty more difficult.](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/22/texas-universities-chancellors-diversity/) Streamlining tax exemptions for elderly and inheritances: Several new laws loosen requirements on reappraisals for spouses and children who inherit property and switch certain appraisal processes. [Senate Bill 1381](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=SB1381) allows certain tax exemptions on homes to carry over to a person’s spouse after they die if they are 65 years or older, and [House Bill 4077](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB4077) removes the need for seniors to apply for homestead exemptions, instead making it the responsibility of the local appraisal district. [House Bill 2354](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB2354) will make it so if a landowner leaves property to their spouse, the land will not be considered as having transferred ownership for tax purposes. Diverting minors charged with Class C misdemeanors: [House Bill 3186](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB3186) creates an alternative to fines for minors charged with class C misdemeanors, such as petty theft or possession of alcohol, instead allowing them to be enrolled in “diversion plans” designed to support them. The law outlines several options for programs, ranging from community service to mandatory mental health treatment, and requires justices and municipal courts to adopt their own plan outlines. It also allows courts to hire a youth diversion coordinator to help track program participants. A child is only eligible for the programs once every 365 days, and is ineligible if the state attorney objects or the child has already unsuccessfully participated in a diversion program. A child can only be diverted from criminal prosecution with written consent from their parents. Expanding exemptions for charitable organizations: Several laws going into effect will provide tax relief for charitable organizations, especially those that are investing in new low-income housing. [ House Bill 1058](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB1058) gives tax credits to those that have investments in low-income housing, and [ House Bill 4645](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB4645) allows organizations to receive tax exemptions on construction of low-income housing, even if they are leasing the land the construction takes place on. [ House Bill 456](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB456) also exempts charitable organizations from taxes on certain interests of minerals on properties they own. Creating new standard for Homeowner Association fees: [House Bill 614 ](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB614)requires homeowner association boards to adopt standardized enforcement policies that detail how they enforce fines — including how much the fines are. It requires a list of potential violations that HOAs must have displayed on their website. Restricting advertising e-cigarettes to minors: [House Bill 4758](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB4758) makes it a class B misdemeanor to sell e-cigarette products that use images of food, celebrities or cartoon characters on their packaging, in an effort to slow vaping use among minors. More than [ two million](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/youth-and-tobacco/results-annual-national-youth-tobacco-survey#Findings%20on%20Youth%20Use%20for%20E-Cigarette%20Products) K-12 students use e-cigarette products nationwide, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Helping doctors understand patient insurance plans: [House Bill 4500](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB4500) will require insurance providers to create internet portals health care providers can access to determine what kinds of insurance plans their patients have in order to streamline the insurance process. The secure portal would tell physicians whether the provider is covered by the patient’s insurance and the patients’ copay, deductible and coinsurance where applicable.

    "text": "[Weather](/minnesota/minneapolis/weather) Massive Solar Flare Could Bring Northern Lights To MN This Week The sun fired off another massive solar flare early Thursday morning, further increasing the chances of seeing the northern lights. MINNESOTA — The sun fired off another massive solar flare early Thursday morning, further increasing the chances of seeing the colorful northern lights in Minnesota on Thursday, Friday, and into the weekend. Thursday’s strong [X9.0 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841828583502700945), the strongest of the current solar cycle, followed Tuesday’s [X7.1 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841524465143841047), increasing the chances the aurora borealis could dip far into the nation’s midsection, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Minnesota weather conditions look favorable for aurora chasers. Find out what's happening in Minneapoliswith free, real-time updates from Patch. The sun is currently at or near “solar maximum,” the peak in its 11-year cycle when heightened geomagnetic storming [increases the chances of seeing the aurora](https://patch.com/us/across-america/sun-nears-solar-maximum-peak-more-northern-lights-displays-likely) far south of its Arctic range. Thursday’s X9.0 flare was stronger than the X8.7 flare in May that [pushed the aurora to near nation’s southern border](https://patch.com/us/across-america/northern-lights-may-dance-far-south-alabama-weekend) in a spectacular display seen around the world. Find out what's happening in Minneapoliswith free, real-time updates from Patch. “Flares of this magnitude in and around solar maximum are generally not common, although not necessarily unusual,” NOAA said in a statement on the social media platform X. But, the agency cautioned, “solar flares of this magnitude can be impulsive,” meaning they are quick to rise and decrease. Some last minutes, while others go on for a few hours. The chances of seeing northern lights generally increase around the [fall equinox](https://patch.com/us/across-america/when-1st-day-fall-2024-what-know-autumnal-equinox), when the sun produces a surplus of geomagnetic storms — almost twice the annual average — but this fall and the coming year should be especially spectacular as Solar Cycle 25 reaches its peak, which NOAA predicts will occur from November through March 2026. The ethereal curtains of pink, purple, green and yellow light have been seen in multiple U.S. locations over the past several months. The Space Weather Prediction Center’s [aurora dashboard](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) is a good site to bookmark for aurora chasers. In general, the best times to see the northern lights are within an hour or two of midnight. [Geomagnetic storms](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms) start with the explosions, or solar flares, of superheated gasses that can be as powerful as a [billion hydrogen bombs](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/space-weather/solar-flares/what-is-a-solar-flare). When this happens, the electron- and proton-charged magnetic particles hurtling toward our planet in a coronal mass ejection, or CME, can temporarily disrupt Earth’s magnetic fields, sending the oval aurora south of its Arctic home, but also potentially disrupting satellite systems and GPS and radio communications.
