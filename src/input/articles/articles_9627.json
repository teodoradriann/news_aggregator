[Kate Green](https://www.rnz.co.nz/authors/kate-green) Patients are facing months of wait-time for elective surgeries, while others are choosing the private route and spending thousands for timely treatment. The health system is under pressure, with workers raising the alarm about staff shortages and burnout, and patients spending months in pain waiting for a diagnosis or an operation. While the coalition government has set targets to shorten wait times, it has also cut funding to the sector. A Greymouth man mortgaged his house to pay for surgery through the private system, after being he would be waiting more than a year on the public list. Shannon - who preferred not to have his last name used - tore a groin muscle a year ago. After three specialist appointments, months apart, for cortisone injections that did not work, his surgeon told him: \"'Look, if you go onto the public waiting system, I don't know how long it will be, but you'll eventually get done.' I said, 'Well, what do I do until then?' and he said, 'We just have to wait and carry on'.\" But with the pain so bad it was hard to walk - and two teenage sons keen to get back to hunting, fishing and tramping with their dad - a year was too long to wait. He decided to bypass the public system and get it done privately, at a cost of $27,500. Only days before his surgery, his mother became another victim of the system's delays. After a fall in the driveway, she was taken to Greymouth Hospital and then transferred to Christchurch, where she waited four days for her leg to be operated on, and then to Dunedin Hospital, where she waited another four. Each day she prepared for surgery, ate nothing, before being told in the afternoon it wouldn't be done that after all. Shannon and his mother were now both recovering - and for Shannon, the operation was \"expensive, but it's worked\". It's really worrying' In Hawke's Bay, Annie Evans' husband is still waiting for cataract surgery after a diagnosis in October. \"It's really worrying,\" she said. \"We've got active lives - we're in our seventies, but we're not sitting around knitting and watching television all day, we're active people doing active things - and I think it's only a matter of time until he has an accident because of this complete lack of vision in the left eye.\" He was not able to drive at night, and soon he wouldn't be able to drive at all. Evans said he had been scheduled for surgery twice, first in July and then most recently last week - but both operations were cancelled last-minute to accommodate other urgent eye cases. \"This isn't life threatening,\" Evans said. \"He's not gonna die from this. But his quality of life is so compromised.\" She said she could not believe the health agency was cutting funding while it was under such pressure. 'A big challenge' Professor Lester Levy, the commissioner who replaced the board of Health New Zealand, said when he got the job one of his priorities was reducing wait times - but three weeks in, the agency's financials were worse than he had thought. \"New Zealanders are waiting too long,\" he told Nine to Noon on Tuesday. \"In my view, the safest wait is the shortest wait, and we've got a big challenge to get those waiting times down.\" Te Whatu Ora said in a statement it was working to improve wait times, and had performed 10 percent more elective surgeries in the year ending May 2024, compared to the year before. But its quarterly performance report, released in July, showed nearly 77,755 patients (40.2 percent) waited longer than four months for a first specialist appointment, compared with 68,179 (36.5 percent) in the previous quarter. But hospital and specialist services delivery unit director Jo Gibbs said demand was growing due to an ageing population, with more complex medical problems and an increase in the treatments available due to new technology. Gibbs confirmed the second phase of a project to improve communication about surgery wait times to patients and GPs was underway. She said in the first phase earlier this year, letters were sent to the more than 25,000 patients who waited longer than 120 days for a first specialist assessment across four specialties: general surgery, ophthalmology, gynaecology, and orthopaedics. They were now expanding it to other specialties.",

    "text": "El hallazgo que explica cómo funciona nuestro cerebro: modifica todos los paradigmas científicos\nUn estudio del CONICET mostró de qué manera el sentido del olfato afecta el aprendizaje y la formación de recuerdos.\nEl aroma de un ser querido, el perfume de tu comida favorita o el olor que evoca la infancia, lo cierto es que el olfato es mucho más que una simple percepción. Este sentido tiene un poder singular para conectarnos con el entorno y con nuestra propia memoria.\nAdemás, desempeña un papel fundamental en diversos aspectos de nuestra vida. Nos ayuda a reconocer alimentos, identificar peligros y establecer lazos sociales, convirtiéndose en una herramienta esencial para la comprensión de nosotros mismos y del mundo que nos rodea.\nAlzheimer | Científicos descubren que quienes tienen este hábito aumentan el riesgo de desarrollar problemas de memoria\nOtras funciones del olfato: hallazgos de la investigación\nUna investigación realizada por especialistas del Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) y publicada en Nature Communications buscó descifrar los circuitos neuronales relacionados con el procesamiento de olores, lo que permite entender cómo el cerebro procesa la información del entorno y forma memorias.\nTras un arduo trabajo, el laboratorio de Circuitos neuronales del IBioBA, dirigido por Antonia Marin-Burgin, descubrió que el aprendizaje mejora la discriminación de olores en la corteza olfativa, ya que al integrar información de diferentes sentidos, optimiza el procesamiento de olores y su relevancia según el ambiente.\n\"Después del aprendizaje, las neuronas responden también a señales posicionales, contextuales y asociativas, activándose con más de un tipo de estímulo, lo que se llama selectividad mezclada. Esto implica que, además de los olores, ahora también codifican información adicional, como el entorno donde ocurrió el olor\", concluyó Marin-Burgin.\nEsta integración de señales no olfativas en una zona olfativa permite crear asociaciones entre olores-ambientes-recompensa en la misma región, lo que mejora la distinción de olores en el mismo ambiente.\n\"La corteza olfativa hace más que oler: integra elementos y al integrar elementos, podría facilitar el aprendizaje, porque el aprendizaje consiste en unir dos o más informaciones\", amplió Sebastián Romano, investigador adjunto del CONICET en el IBioBA y uno de los primeros autores del estudio.\nLa capacidad olfativa: un indicador precoz de enfermedades neurodegenerativas como Alzheimer y Parkinson\nEsta investigación adquiere un rol fundamental, ya que diversos estudios científicos sostuvieron anteriormente que una reducción de la capacidad olfativa puede ser un síntoma temprano de enfermedades como Alzheimer o Parkinson.\n\"Existen muchas enfermedades neurodegenerativas, e incluso virales, donde la pérdida del olfato es uno de los primeros síntomas, por lo tanto, comprender los circuitos neuronales relacionados con el procesamiento de olores puede ofrecer nuevos conocimientos para el desarrollo de tratamientos potenciales\", indicó Marin-Burgin.\nEl estudio dejó claro un aspecto sobre el funcionamiento cerebral: el cerebro integra información desde las primeras etapas de procesamiento.\n\"El cerebro procesa la información que recibe del entorno de forma más colectiva y distribuida, no es el cerebro verticalista que pensábamos que era\", concluyó Sebastián Romano.\nMercados\nDólar hoy y dólar blue hoy: cuál es la cotización del miércoles 23 de abril minuto a minuto\nCuál es el precio del dólar oficial y de los dólares financieros CCL y MEP.\nToda la información que necesitás sobre la semana en los mercados.\nBonos, acciones, riesgo país, Cedears y plazo fijo.",

De acuerdo con Ariadna Montiel, [secretaria de Bienestar](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/economia/2024/12/25/pension-de-adultos-mayores-de-cuanto-sera-el-aumento-al-monto-en-2025-664033.html), las señoras de 63 y 64 años de edad serán las primeras en recibir este beneficio con el cual se buscará retribuir al sexo femenino por todas sus labores dentro y fuera del hogar.\nComo en toda la República Mexicana, las beneficiarias de Tepic, Nayarit, comenzarán a recibir sus tarjetas en enero y en febrero, se prevé que será en el segundo mes del año cuando se comiencen a dispersar los tres mil pesos que se darán a todas las seleccionadas para recibir este recurso por parte del Estado.\nNo se han dado a conocer los puntos en los cuales se entregarán los plásticos, aunque lo más seguro es que algunos de los puntos en los que se lleve a cabo esta acción coincidan con los módulos que la Secretaría del Bienestar tiene en la entidad. A fin de que las personas que hicieron su registro antes de diciembre de 2024 y de aquellas que buscarán obtener esta inscripción en 2025 tengan información clara para hacer el trámite, a continuación se presentan la ubicación de todos los sitios de atención de la dependencia.\n¿Dónde están ubicados los módulos de registro de la Secretaría de Bienestar en Tepic?\nDe acuerdo con la página oficial de la Secretaría de Bienestar en Tepic, Nayarit, hay tres módulos en los cuales se pueden llevar a cabo los trámites de atención de dudas, quejas, entrega de plástico, registro de beneficiarios, así como sugerencias relacionadas con los programas de la dependencia.\nA continuación la lista completa de los puntos donde se desarrollan estos trámites en el municipio liderado por Geraldine Ponce. Es posible que se anexen nuevos sitios para atender de mejor manera a los ciudadanos, aunque actualmente estos son todos los recintos que se tienen fijos en la zona.\n- Avenida Rey Nayar número 43, colonia Burócrata Federal. Está a un lado de Tránsito.\n- Calle Revolución Social 303, colonia Menchaca, 63150 Tepic, Nayarit.\n- Calle Paraíso 263, colonia Fraccionamiento Versalles Sur, entre Cedro y Encino.\n¿Qué requisitos piden para la Pensión Mujeres Bienestar?\nLa Secretaría del Bienestar dio a conocer que para que las personas puedan ser inscritas en este programa social es necesario que cuentan con los siguientes documentos.\n- INE o documento de identidad vigente con fotografía y oficial.\n- Acta de nacimiento. Clave Única de Registro de Población (CURP) reciente.\n- Comprobante de domicilio no mayor a seis meses de antigüedad.\n- Teléfono de contacto (celular, personal o fijo).\n¿Cuándo depositan mujeres con Bienestar en 2025 y quiénes pueden inscribirse?\nLas inscripciones a este programa se cerraron en noviembre de 2025; no obstante, se prevé que se vuelvan a abrir el registro para febrero de 2025 y se establezca cada dos meses la temporada para unir más personas a esta iniciativa del gobierno de Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo.\nEn una primera etapa, solamente se permitirá que se incluyan las mujeres de 63 y 64 años de edad; no obstante, se prevé que este programa cubra a las señoras de todo México que tengan entre 60 a 64 años de edad. Una vez que cumplan los 65, las beneficiarias no tendrán que hacer ningún trámite para quedar inscritas automáticamente al programa Pensión para el Bienestar de Adultos Mayores.\nEl primer depósito de 2025 se hará en febrero de 2025 y se estableció que las seleccionadas recibirán un total de tres mil pesos bimestrales, los cuales las ayudarán a solventar sus gastos personales.\nSigue leyendo:\n[Bienestar: en estos programas te puedes inscribir y recibir dinero sin importar la edad](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/economia/2024/12/23/bienestar-en-estos-programas-te-puedes-inscribir-recibir-dinero-sin-importar-la-edad-663603.html#google_vignette)\n[Secretaría del Bienestar entrega apoyos a productores agrícolas en Sonora](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/nacional/2024/12/24/secretaria-del-bienestar-entrega-apoyos-productores-agricolas-en-sonora-663894.html)",

    "text": "[Daniel Gonzalez](https://www.colombia.com/staff/2152/daniel-gonzalez)• Colombia.com Una verdadera nevera: Las razones por las que está haciendo tanto frío en Bogotá La capital del país viene presentando temperaturas demasiado bajas, las cuales han venido acompañadas por altos niveles de nubosidad. La capital del país viene presentando temperaturas demasiado bajas, las cuales han venido acompañadas por altos niveles de nubosidad. Bogotá es considerada como una de las partes de Colombia en las que más se presentan bajas temperaturas, recordando que la capital del país tiene en promedio temperaturas de 14 °C en el día y de 10 °C por las noches. Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas, esta parte de la nación viene presentando un aumento en los climas bajos, situación que comenzó a preocupar a los expertos del clima. Para nadie es un secreto que, desde el mes de agosto, Bogotá presenta un crecimiento en sus temperaturas bajas, las cuales son acompañadas por la llegada de fuertes vientos, los cuales sirven para potenciar algunas actividades al aire libre como elevar cometas. De la misma manera, el fenómeno de la niña se encuentra a la vuelta de la esquina, por lo que Colombia está próximo a recibir una de las temporadas de lluvias más fuertes en los últimos años. A pesar de tener presente todos estos alicientes, esta no es la única razón para que Bogotá esté presentando un clima tan bajo en las últimas semanas. Desde el pasado 31 de julio, la capital del país viene presentando vientos aproximados a los de 35 kilómetros por hora, aspecto que juega un papel fundamental para que las temperaturas disminuyan en todo el territorio capitalino. Como si fuera poco esto, expertos del Departamento de Geografía de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, han señalado que este aumento en los vientos en Bogotá se debe a las condiciones meteorológicas especiales creadas por la ZCIT. “La alta velocidad de los vientos que se experimenta durante esta época del año se debe al efecto de los vientos alisios del sureste, que se desplazan hacia el norte y localizan su máxima intensidad sobre gran parte del sur y centro del territorio colombiano”. Por ahora, Bogotá y toda Colombia tiene que seguir tomando medidas, con la intención de hacerle frente al fenómeno de la niña con todas las herramientas necesarias. De consolidar todas estas iniciativas, el país podría llegar a evitar una gran cantidad de catástrofes naturales, las cuales podrían generar pérdidas económicas y problemas en la salud de todos los ciudadanos colombianos.",

    "text": "Dive Brief:\n- Job cuts disclosed Tuesday at digital payments company Block affected 931 employees, or about 8% of the firm’s total workforce of 11,300, according to analysts at TD Cowen who provided the information in a note to investment clients Wednesday.\n- The cuts were likely made in the name of efficiency and streamlining of the digital payments company, TD Cowen analysts wrote. Block is the parent company to the payments companies Square, Cash App and Afterpay.\n- “We see this as additional evidence of active engagement by the CEO to accelerate product velocity and improve profitability,” the analysts said.\nDive Insight:\nThe cuts were disclosed in a company-wide email from Block’s cofounder and chairman, Jack Dorsey, Tuesday which was earlier reported by the tech focused news website TechCrunch. Dorsey is also effectively the CEO.\nOf the 931 jobs that will be eliminated, 391 were cut for “strategy” reasons, while 460 were cut for performance reasons, and 80 manager positions were eliminated in order to “flatten” the company’s hierarchy, the email says. The message provides few additional details.\nBlock is also closing 748 open positions, with some exceptions, Dorsey’s email says.\n“None of the above points are trying to hit a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap,” Dorsey wrote in the email, according to TechCrunch. “They are specific to our needs around strategy.”\nFlattening the company’s hierarchy should ultimately benefit Block by reducing the amount of time it takes to move new products to the market, the TD Cowen analysts wrote.\n“We believe this should bolster direct sales teams' ability to ramp up quickly,” the analysts’ note says.\nThe Oakland, California-based company began integrating Afterpay onto its Cash App debit card in February.\n“Why do this all at once instead of over time?” Dorsey wrote to employees Tuesday. “We’re behind in our actions, and that’s not fair to the individuals who work here. When we know, we should move, and there hasn’t been enough movement.”\nBlock has a history of trimming its workforce. In November 2023, CFO Amrita Ahuja announced the company would shed around 8% of its workforce throughout 2024.\nA Block spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment",

Mr Deo emphasised that the Foundation and GIZ were using the additional time to strengthen project preparations.\nA new launch date is expected to be announced in the coming months.",
