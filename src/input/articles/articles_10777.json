    "text": "Middletown cop charged with shoplifting $500 in merchandise: Monmouth County Prosecutor [Erik Larsen](/staff/2647814001/erik-larsen/) FREEHOLD – A Middletown police officer is charged with shoplifting about $500 in merchandise from multiple locations of a discount store chain, in one instance while in uniform, according to the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office. Brenden B. Santiago, 36, of Tinton Falls, faces one count of third-degree shoplifting and one count of fourth-degree attempted shoplifting. The incidents are alleged to have occurred in December and earlier this month, according to a statement. An investigation by the Professional Responsibility Unit of the Prosecutor’s Office and the Middletown Police Department determined that Santiago “skip-scanned” items, “essentially scanning multiple less-expensive items and not scanning more-expensive items — or pretending to scan them and leaving the store without paying for them on six different occasions,” the Prosecutor’s Office said in the statement. Latest headlines: [Matawan man admits to killing his father, hiding his body in the home they shared](/story/news/crime/2024/01/25/matawan-man-32-pleads-guilty-in-the-slaying-of-his-father/72351441007/) On Jan. 9, in what would have been the seventh such instance, Santiago was caught in the act. He was confronted and asked for his receipt as he attempted to leave the store, according to the statement. “The criminal conduct alleged in the complaints filed against Patrolman Santiago are deeply troubling and do not reflect the values of our agency,” Middletown Police Chief R. Craig Weber said. “We firmly believe that trust and integrity are the essential cornerstones of policing and we hold our employees to the highest professional and ethical standards. Santiago has been relieved of duty and suspended without pay pending the resolution of this matter.” Defense attorney Jeffrey Garrigan of Jersey City, who is representing Santiago in the matter, said the officer is presumed innocent and will plead not guilty to the charges. “We are waiting to see what evidence the state claims to have and my client will address the allegations in due course,” Garrigan said. “Officer Santiago has an unblemished record and has been a stellar member of the Middletown Police Department for a lengthy period of time.” More: [Manchester man pleads guilty in antisemitic terror spree in Lakewood and Jackson](/story/news/local/courts/2024/01/24/manchester-man-dion-marsh-admits-targeting-jewish-antisemitism/72259774007/) According to public records, Santiago has been a police officer since January 2012 and received an annual salary of $88,884. Anyone who may have additional information to report about this matter is asked to contact Detective Brian Hammarstrom of the Prosecutor’s Office at 800-533-7443. The case has been assigned to Assistant Prosecutor Melanie Falco, director of the Professional Responsibility Unit. The case is similar to one in Brick last year where a [Point Pleasant police sergeant was charged with stealing groceries from the local Walmart](/story/news/local/courts/2023/10/11/shoplifting-charges-against-point-pleasant-cop-joshua-gunnell/71123718007/), after going through a self-checkout lane. Much of the case against Detective Sgt. Joshua H. Gunnell, 41, was dismissed after he agreed to resign from the Point Pleasant Police Department.

    "text": "Today, patients with rare diseases in Maryland are one step closer to accessing cutting-edge medical treatments designed just for them. In a unanimous, bipartisan show of support, the Maryland Senate has voted to send House Bill 676 to Governor Wes Moore for his consideration and approval. This action follows unanimous support for the reform in the Maryland House of Delegates\nChampioned by Delegate Matt Morgan, and modeled after the Goldwater Institute’s Right to Try for Individualized Treatments , HB 676 empowers patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases to work with their physicians to seek innovative, highly specialized treatments that are as unique as they are.\nWith nearly 80% of rare diseases estimated to be genetic in nature, it is no surprise that access to innovative, individualized gene therapies is top of mind for many patients. Fortunately, new technologies and recent advances in modern medicine have made it possible for researchers to tailor treatments to an individual patient using his or her own genetics. If signed into law by Governor Moore, HB 676 will protect the right of patients to pursue these customized treatments at the recommendation of their physicians and in concert with strong patient protections.\nMaryland native Hannah Lowe is the mother of a young boy who is suffering from a rare and fatal form of childhood muscular dystrophy. She and her family know firsthand that time is of the essence for many rare disease treatments, and that parents deserve the right to pursue all available options on behalf of their children.\nOn February 29, Rare Disease Day, Hannah provided testimony on the need for the reform in Maryland.\n“Under the current regulatory framework, the process for getting new treatments into patients is long, and this is time that we do not have,” she noted. “We are not asking for a handout. We are asking for laws like HB 676 that would allow medical treatments to be developed faster with appropriate safety and efficacy measures, and under physician care and guidance for people for whom there are no treatments and no cures.”\n“Americans are in the midst of a medical revolution where new treatments are discovered almost daily,” Goldwater Institute Senior Fellow Naomi Lopez said. “Some rare genetic diseases that used to be a death sentence are now treatable using the patient’s unique and personal genetic information. House Bill 676 is a significant step to bringing these treatments to patients with rare diseases in Maryland.”\nMaryland legislators have a long history of leadership on this important issue. In 2017, Maryland’s legislature approved Goldwater’s Right to Try reform, landmark legislation to protect the right of terminally ill patients to access investigational treatments advancing through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval process.\nHB 676 builds on this successful history and demonstrates the enduring commitment of Maryland lawmakers to protect and empower patients with rare diseases.\nMaryland is not alone in pursuing this innovative approach. In 2022, Arizona became the first state to enact the Right to Try for Individualized Treatments, with Nevada following close behind in 2023. This session, California, Iowa, and Mississippi have also introduced similar models.\n“Maryland is only the third state in the nation to pass this groundbreaking legislation,” Delegate Morgan said. “This signifies a ray of hope for those needing innovative treatments for terminal and disability diseases. It is a significant step in our effort to enhance healthcare and embrace patients’ right to live.”\nThe Goldwater Institute thanks Delegate Morgan and his co-sponsors for their commitment to HB 676, and shares in their appreciation of the patients and advocates who supported the bill.\nThe Institute commends the Maryland General Assembly for standing up for patients with rare diseases, and expresses its sincere appreciation to Governor Moore for his consideration of this important reform.\nHeather Curry is the Director of Strategic Engagement at the Goldwater Institute, where she leads the Institute’s state and national legislative affairs efforts.",

    "text": "It has long been believed that an asteroid impact with Earth ended the era of the dinosaurs, but researchers have revealed that a more fundamental process may have played a bigger role in the extinction of the dinosaurs. It was generally considered the first.\nAbout 6.6 million years ago, when an asteroid 10 to 15 km wide hit Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, the collision wreaked havoc. The collision resulted in forest fires, earthquakes, and massive tsunamis that destroyed ecosystems that allowed plants and animals to thrive.\nIn a new report published in the journal Nature Geoscience, researchers believe that while these other impacts may have severely damaged hundreds of dinosaur species, the role of another impact was overlooked in previous studies. That is, billions of tons of dust that would have spread into the atmosphere after the asteroid hit the earth.\nBelgian researchers believe the asteroid triggered a ‘global winter’ as dark clouds of dust filled with sand and sulfur particles spread into the atmosphere, blocking the sun’s rays from reaching Earth and causing global warming. The Earth’s surface temperature dropped to 15 degrees Celsius.\nPlants may have had difficulty surviving due to low light, which starved herbivores and deprived carnivores of prey. Due to lack of food, 75% of the organisms died out.\nIt is believed that the amount of dust in the atmosphere was about 2,000 gigatons, 11 times the weight of Mount Everest.\nThis section contains related reference points (Related Nodes field).\nResearchers created a computer-aided environment using material from the bottom of a fossil site in North Dakota, where they found that the dust can block sunlight from reaching the Earth for up to two years and possibly 15 years. can remain in the atmosphere for years, limiting the ability of plants to produce energy and destroying natural ecosystems.\nStudies show that although the initial impact of the asteroid impact on Earth was severe, it did not kill the dinosaurs immediately, but rather gradually over a period of years.\nOther researchers believe that the impact of an asteroid hitting the Earth could be similar to that of a nuclear bomb.\nIn a report published last year led by Louisiana State University professor Cherley Harrison, researchers said smoke and black carbon could have reached the atmosphere and blocked sunlight from reaching Earth, resulting in a ‘nuclear explosion’. The resulting ‘Little Ice Age’ may have begun.\nAlthough the dinosaurs died out catastrophically about 6.6 million years ago, their extinction may have been important for the development of the human race.\n“Dinosaurs dominated the Earth when the asteroid hit and were living comfortably,” says study co-author and planetary scientist Philip Claes.\n‘I don’t think mammals, including us, would have become the dominant species on this planet without this collision.’\n#Research #solves #mystery #dinosaur #extinction\n2024-10-03 21:49:21",
