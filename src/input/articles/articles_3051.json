    "text": "[Letters to the Editor](https://newsday.co.tt/category/opinion/letters-to-the-editor) Step in right direction by Presbyterian Church [Newsday](https://newsday.co.tt/reporter/real-time) THE EDITOR: The Presbyterian Church of TT has made a step in the right direction by initiating a values education programme in its five secondary schools. This initiative was led by Moderator Rev Daniel Chance, newly elected general secretary Ashford Tamby, former general secretary Terrence Warde and the Ministry of Education. Tamby is a former chairman of the Presbyterian Secondary Schools Board of Education. The participating secondary schools are Naparima College, Naparima Girls’ High School, St Augustine Girls’ High School, Iere High School and Hillview College. This intervention may be extended to the 72 church-run primary schools at a later date. On his return from the recent Caricom Heads of Government Conference in Guyana, Prime Minister Rowley referred to the “trauma faced when people lose loved ones and see the outcome of violent crime.” He also noted that his colleague, St Kitts/Nevis Prime Minister Dr Terrance Drew, raised concerns about “children being damaged after experiencing violence in the home,” as well as “being brought up without any semblance of training or values.” I believe that Drew’s observation is good reason for values education to be taken seriously by all of us. My mother used to say children who grow up without values will be a danger to themselves and others. Take heed, dear friends. The reality is that crime is out of control in TT. The criminal element seems to be growing in strength, gangs seem to be growing in confidence, and data suggest that all responses to crime have proven futile. There is urgent need, therefore, for hard and soft measures in response. In pursuing this values education initiative, the Presbyterian Church has enlisted the support of former moderator Rev Elvis Elahie to conduct workshops on the subject with teachers at the five secondary schools. Elahie, a past principal of St Andrew’s Theological College, has been engaging values education since 2002 in response to societal decay. Over the past five years, this response has evolved into a values education programme (VEP) for teachers and principals. And through this programme the Presbyterian Church continues to lead in its holistic approach to education. My conversations with Elahie have brought clarity as regards the content and character of the programme. It has specific aims with desired outcomes. The introduction points teachers and all the people in positions of influence to become role models because values are emulated. A role model is defined as “one in whom there is goodness and in whose life there is continuous improvement.” Elahie quotes Jalal al-Din Muhammed Rumi (1207-1273), “Yesterday I was clever, and I wanted to change the world, today I am wise, so I am changing myself.” The emphasis therefore is on personal transformation. VEP consists of five modules. The first one looks at finding a moral compass. Here ethics is defined as the science of morality. Basic ethical theories are explored and the issues of morality are deliberated on as referenced by reality. Module two examines thinking, and explores the benefits of critical, creative and collaborative thinking. The third module focuses on self-understanding and delves into self-actualisation as a process for personality creation and character development. Module four deals with meaning and purpose and the fifth module identifies what determines good behaviour and the authentic life. A good move by both the church and the Ministry of Education.

    "text": "Nigerian Gen Zs are leading a revival in gospel music, according to data shared with BusinessDay by Spotify.\nThe streaming platform revealed that the number of streams for Nigerian Gen Z Christian podcasts rose 482 percent between 2022 and 2024. Similarly, Gospel music streams by the same demographic surged 1228 percent in the same period.\nRead also: 7 gospel music tracks that shaped our childhood\nThis growth indicates the growing interest in faith and spirituality among young people in Nigeria, the platform stated.\nOyegoke Yetunde, an avid gospel streamer, agreed that the increase in the streaming of faith-based content among Nigerian Gen Zs reflects a broader trend of younger generations seeking spiritual fulfilment and connection in the digital age.\n“Digital platforms provide easy access to various contents, including religious and spiritual content, and the younger generations are using these platforms to broaden their faith in new ways,” she told BusinessDay.\nSome others don’t agree that the trend reflects young people seeking spiritual fulfillment as that is individual.\nOlamide Ologunagbe, an avid gospel streamer of the same age demographic, said, “Everyone listens to music for different reasons. Though it’s easier to listen to music these days, there has to be a deliberate effort for someone to stream the music first, which leads to Spotify curating playlists to suit one’s music taste regardless of the genre, but there is no connection in seeking spiritual fulfillment.”\nSpotify said the enthusiasm for Gospel music is further shown in the number of playlists created by these young listeners. The platform revealed that there are over 140,000 gospel playlists.\nAccording to Spotify data, Sunday is the day most young Nigerians listen to Gospel music and Christian podcasts. Furthermore, these streams peak in the early hours, from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.\nThis trend reflects a broader global movement in which tech-savvy young people find new ways to connect with their faith through technology.\n“Streaming faith-based content on Sunday mornings does suggest that there is an evolving relationship between spirituality and modern digital habits, with platforms like Spotify catering to the preferences and lifestyles of young people who are increasingly turning to online platforms for various forms of content, including spiritual ones,” Oyegoke added.",

(Photo/Courtesy of the Arizona State University Provost’s Office)\nShare\nUniversity\nGlobal sustainability pioneer named dean of the USC Price School of Public Policy\nChristopher Boone joins USC Price after decades of work supporting the growth of sustainability programs in colleges and universities across the country.\nDecember 05, 2024 By Chinyere Cindy Amobi\nSustainability pioneer Christopher Boone has been named the newest dean of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy. An international expert in urban sustainability, global environmental change, urbanization and environmental justice, Boone will hold the C. Erwin and Ione L. Piper Dean’s Chair at USC Price beginning Jan. 1, 2025.\nThe environmental justice leader joins USC after decades of impactful work supporting the growth of sustainability programs in colleges and universities across the country.\n“Chris Boone brings great depth of experience and expertise in areas of vital importance to the Price School and to USC, including sustainability, national policy, and global challenges,” said President Carol Folt. “He is an expansive thinker and experienced leader who will hit the ground running with vision, strategy and a strong focus on continued excellence and leadership by Price faculty, staff and students.”\nBoone spoke of his excitement to join a university whose senior leadership embraced sustainability as a high-priority field of study. His ambitions are in line with Folt’s sustainability moonshot, which aims to ensure the university remains at the forefront of sustainability operations, research and education through interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative approaches to complex challenges.\n“President Folt’s commitment to engaging people on sustainability efforts from across all parts of the university, from operations to academics to research as one of the moonshots made this a very attractive proposition for me,” Boone said.\nBuilding from the ground up Boone, who currently serves as a professor at Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability, has held a variety of positions at ASU during his 18-year tenure, bringing an interdisciplinary approach to innovation within that field of study. As the founding dean of the university’s College of Global Futures from 2020 to 2021, he established a new college by combining the existing School of Sustainability and the School for the Future of Innovation in Society to create the School of Complex Adaptive Systems. In this role, he oversaw over 200 faculty and staff members and 2,000 students. He also launched a Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion working group for the college.\n“I’ve described this experience to people as both liberating and terrifying,” Boone said. “Liberating in the sense that we weren’t beholden to old ways of doing things, and terrifying in the sense that we knew that we had to get it right because others were watching what we were doing and were curious to learn how we were going to help support this new and evolving field.”\nAs dean of ASU’s School of Sustainability from 2013 to 2020, he provided leadership to 621 majors and over 2,800 students in various sustainability programs and maintained the highest freshman retention rates on campus through the recruitment of high-caliber faculty and staff.\nHe also developed a love of fundraising, a passion he hopes to reignite in his new role at USC.\n“It gives you a chance to work with alumni and outside partners and try to find where you can get a mission match between what the school is trying to achieve and what the donors are looking for,” Boone said. “That’s kind of a fun puzzle to figure out — and when people decide to give, I can tell you personally that it’s a very joyful moment for them.”\nA global leader in sustainability efforts For more than a decade, Boone has held numerous roles that have had an impact on sustainability issues worldwide, including as a board member for the Global Council for Science and the Environment, which is dedicated to advancing the scientific basis for environmental decision making, and as a member of the scientific steering committee of the Urbanization and Global Environmental Change Program.\nAs an executive committee member for the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, a global award administered by USC, he has also aided in the review of nominations to select the Tyler Prize Laureate and advance the goals of the prize.\nBoone also served as a co-principal investigator for two Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) programs: the Baltimore Ecosystem Study and the Central Arizona Phoenix LTER. He has also held more than a dozen academic appointments at leading research universities including Georgetown University, Yale University, Ohio University and California State University, Los Angeles. He has authored and co-authored three books, 21 book chapters, and 56 journal articles. His scholarship has been supported with 62 research grants totaling $40 million.\nBoone also co-founded the National Sustainability Society, which convenes colleges and universities with individuals from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to discuss how to move the needle on sustainability issues. After also serving as the president of the organization, he’ll hand off the baton ahead of his new role in January.\n“We are excited for Christopher’s innovative and forward-thinking spirit, expertise in sustainability and public policy, and excellence in leadership that he will bring to our community and into the future,” said USC Provost Andrew T. Guzman, senior vice president for academic affairs.\nFalling in love with cities It was during Boone’s work on the Baltimore Ecosystem Study that he fell in love with an “interdisciplinary way of knowing about the world.” The project involved a collection of experts from different disciplines trying to figure out how Baltimore functioned as a “human ecosystem,” working with city, county, and local nonprofit leaders to improve the well-being of people in the region.\n“I’ve always been interested in urbanization, and I love cities,” Boone said. “Moving back to L.A. will be a real treat in that sense.”\nBoone earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in geography from Queen’s University in Canada in 1987 and his master’s degree and PhD in the same subject from the University of Toronto.\nOriginally from Canada, he expressed his excitement to join the Trojan Family and move back to L.A. at such an exciting time for the city.\n“I fell in love with the city when I was a faculty member at Cal State Los Angeles because of the energy and the diversity,” Boone said. “The whole world is in L.A., and people pay attention to what happens there — especially as the city figures out solutions to complex problems that can not only improve the well-being and environment for L.A., but also have a ripple effect on cities around the world.”\nHe cites the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games as prime examples of how L.A. — in partnership with interdisciplinary sustainability experts at USC Price and beyond — can influence how cities address complex problems while improving and protecting the lives of their inhabitants.\n“At this stage of my career, I want to tackle the complex, difficult, challenging problems,” Boone said. “Being able to draw on all those different knowledge sets, all those methodologies, theories, and ways of knowing allow you to translate that interdisciplinarity into solutions, and that is very attractive to me.”\nBuilding a sustainable future Boone described sensing USC’s “intense interdisciplinarity” long before accepting his new position. “Even from the interactions I’ve had with faculty, staff and students, it’s not just a word — it seems to be fundamental to the practice of how the school operates,” he said.\nHe hopes to engage with external partners and people from across the university’s campuses to think about how to build urban centers and retrofit urban designs to create ways for cities to meet global sustainability goals.\n“The fact that I’m coming to a new institution is exciting in itself — the fact that it’s USC in particular, with all the qualities that I spoke of, makes it particularly intriguing,” Boone said. “I’m excited about meeting all my new colleagues and students and figuring out all the amazing expertise in the staff in the school. It’s all going to be really exciting and fun.”",

    "title": "Manassas Plumbing Pros Launches Innovative Eco-Friendly Plumbing Solutions",
    "text": "In a significant stride towards environmental sustainability, Manassas Plumbing Pros has introduced a range of innovative eco-friendly\nplumbing solutions. Recognized for their commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, this plumbing company is set to revolutionize the industry with their green initiatives. Homeowners and businesses alike are expected to benefit from these cutting-edge technologies and practices, which aim to conserve water, reduce energy consumption, and minimize environmental impact.\nThe introduction of eco-friendly solutions by this\nplumbing company Manassas is a testament to their dedication to both their customers and the environment. In recent years, the necessity for sustainable practices has been increasingly emphasized, with climate change and resource depletion becoming pressing global issues. The adoption of green plumbing practices not only addresses these concerns but also offers numerous benefits to property owners, including cost savings and improved system efficiency.\nWater Conservation Technologies\nOne of the primary focuses of Manassas Plumbing Pros’ eco-friendly initiative is water conservation. Advanced technologies and practices have been employed to significantly reduce water wastage. Low-flow fixtures, such as taps, showerheads, and toilets, have been introduced, which use considerably less water compared to traditional fixtures. These low-flow alternatives maintain high performance while drastically cutting down on water usage, thus contributing to substantial water savings over time.\nFurthermore, dual-flush toilets have been made available, offering users the option to use different volumes of water for liquid and solid waste. This simple yet effective solution can result in considerable water conservation, especially in larger households and commercial properties. Rainwater harvesting systems have also been promoted, allowing the collection and utilization of rainwater for non-potable uses such as irrigation and flushing toilets.\nEnergy-Efficient Water Heaters\nAnother significant aspect of the eco-friendly solutions introduced by this plumbing company is the promotion of energy-efficient water heaters. Traditional water heaters can be highly energy-intensive, contributing to increased energy bills and a larger carbon footprint. In contrast, energy-efficient water heaters, such as tankless and solar water heaters, offer a more sustainable alternative.\nTankless water heaters, which heat water on demand, have been highlighted for their ability to provide a continuous supply of hot water while using significantly less energy. Solar water heaters, which utilize solar energy to heat water, represent an even more environmentally friendly option, harnessing renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. By encouraging the adoption of these energy-efficient water heaters, Manassas Plumbing Pros aims to help customers lower their energy consumption and decrease their overall environmental impact.\nLeak Detection and Prevention\nWater leaks, both minor and major, can lead to significant water wastage and property damage. Innovative leak detection and prevention technologies have been introduced by this\nplumbing company near me to address these issues effectively. Advanced leak detection systems, which utilize sensors and real-time monitoring, allow for the early identification and repair of leaks, preventing water loss and potential damage.\nAutomatic shut-off valves, which can be installed to stop the water supply in the event of a detected leak, provide an additional layer of protection. These systems are particularly beneficial in preventing extensive damage and costly repairs, offering peace of mind to homeowners and business owners alike. The proactive approach to leak detection and prevention taken by Manassas Plumbing Pros underscores their commitment to conserving water and protecting their customers’ properties.\nSustainable Plumbing Materials\nIn addition to implementing water-saving and energy-efficient technologies, the use of sustainable plumbing materials has been prioritized by Manassas Plumbing Pros. Traditional plumbing materials, such as PVC and other plastics, can have a detrimental impact on the environment due to their non-biodegradable nature and the pollution associated with their production. To counteract this, eco-friendly alternatives, such as PEX piping and copper, have been adopted.\nPEX piping, known for its durability and flexibility, is not only easier to install but also has a lower environmental impact compared to traditional materials. Copper, a recyclable and long-lasting material, offers a sustainable choice for plumbing installations. By choosing these environmentally friendly materials, the plumbing company near me is furthering its commitment to reducing its ecological footprint and promoting sustainable practices within the industry.\nCustomer Education and Engagement\nAn integral part of the eco-friendly initiative by Manassas Plumbing Pros involves educating and engaging their customers. It is recognized that for significant change to occur, it is essential for customers to be informed about the benefits and importance of adopting green plumbing practices. To this end, the plumbing company has launched various educational campaigns and resources, including informational brochures, workshops, and online content.\nCustomers are encouraged to participate in the eco-friendly movement by making small yet impactful changes, such as upgrading to low-flow fixtures, regularly checking for leaks, and considering the installation of energy-efficient water heaters. By fostering a culture of sustainability and environmental responsibility, Manassas Plumbing Pros aims to create a lasting positive impact within the community.\nThe launch of innovative eco-friendly plumbing solutions by Manassas Plumbing Pros marks a significant milestone in the plumbing industry. By prioritizing water conservation, energy efficiency, and the use of sustainable materials, this\nplumbing company Manassas is leading the way toward a more sustainable future. Homeowners and businesses are invited to join in these efforts, benefitting from reduced water and energy bills, while also contributing to the preservation of the environment. Through continued education and engagement, Manassas Plumbing Pros is poised to make a lasting difference, one plumbing system at a time.\nManassas Plumbing Pros is a leading plumbing company in Manassas, renowned for its commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction.

    "title": "Amazon CEO shareholder letter: AI mania, faster delivery - Fast Company",
    "text": "This morning, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy published his 2023 letter to shareholders.\nThe year began with quite a splash for Amazon, as the company instituted the largest job cuts in its history, laying off more than 27,000 employees . The layoffs came on the heels of a tough period for the e-commerce giant in 2022 when stock fell 51%.\nHowever, Jassy opened his letter by stating that he has “even more” enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future than at this time last year, revealing that Amazon’s revenue for 2023 was up 12% year over year. Here are the main takeaways from what he said next:\nDelivery speeds will get even faster Good news for the impatient: Over seven billion Amazon items arrived same day or next day this year, and Jassy expects even faster delivery times in 2024, with the first quarter already outpacing last year. The company plans to double its fulfillment centers, which are same-day facilities that streamline the time between item selection and shipping to 11 minutes. In addition to more of these facilities, Jassy says Amazon plans to expand its drone delivery service (called Prime Air), which will allow the company to get customers packages in less than an hour.\nAI is mentioned 33 times Jassy is hot on artificial intelligence, writing that when people ask him today “what’s next,” he says it would have to be “GenerativeAI.” He wrote that while much of the public is consumed by AI applications such as ChatGPT, Amazon views generative AI in three distinct layers, with the application being just one of them. He provided insight into how Amazon is approaching each:\nThe bottom layer, he stated, is for developers and companies looking to build foundation models—the key for which is the chip. Jassy explained that while Amazon will continue to offer the broadest collection of Nvidia chips of any provider, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue. The middle layer is for customers seeking to customize one of the existing foundation models with their own data. On that front, Amazon now has a service called Bedrock that lets companies build generative AI applications. The final layer is the application layer, which Amazon has built a substantial number of across every Amazon consumer business. Applications include Rufus, an AI-powered shopping assistant, an “even more capable Alexa,” and increased advertising capabilities. Commitment to cost-cutting “Cost to serve” is down on a per-unit basis globally for the first time since 2018, Jassy wrote, with U.S. numbers down by more than 45 cents per unit year over year. Part of this stems from Amazon’s regionalization efforts, which have cut transportation distances and costs.\nAmazon’s operating income in 2023 improved by 201% year over year. Looking to 2024, Jassy states that Amazon remains committed to continuing to lower costs, emphasizing fulfillment architecture and inventory placement areas.\nAdvertising success Amazon’s advertising revenue has grown 24% year over year, primarily driven by sponsored ads. Jassy wrote Amazon has added Sponsored TV, which allows brands to create campaigns that will appear on up to around 30 streaming TV services, such as Twitch and Amazon FreeVee. The company has also expanded by ( controversially ) adding ads to Prime Video shows and movies, which Jassy stated allows brands to reach 200 million monthly viewers.\nNow in 2024, Amazon stock is near an all-time high, up 22%. Jassy concluded the letter by stating, “There has never been a time in Amazon’s history where we’ve felt there is so much opportunity to make our customers’ lives better and easier.”\nRecognize your company's culture of innovation by applying to this year's Best Workplaces for Innovators Awards before the extended deadline, April 12.",

    "text": "Setting up an indoor water wall feature means setting up a space that is not only particularly evocative from an aesthetic point of view but also increases living or business comfort.\nThe interior water walls at Midwest Tropical are perfect in residential or commercial contexts, allowing you to enhance settings and, at the same time, take on an attractive symbolic value to achieve peace and serenity.\nIndoor water wall feature: versatile characteristics\nAs we know, water refers to the deeper meaning of life, to purity and complete well-being. The presence of an interior water wall is fundamental in any property. For this reason, it will be possible to install a water wall feature with an exclusive design to obtain a whole series of benefits.\nAt Midwest Tropical, our indoor water wall feature is nothing more than an architectural element in line with the latest design trends. It also performs various practical functions, as it can be effectively used to separate rooms without obstructing the passage of light. Our interior water wall designs are fascinating for decorating spaces that would otherwise be bare or anonymous.\nThe assortment of water wall features to be placed exclusively indoors is wider than you might imagine. It includes models made with different materials, which fit well with any style and finish in the room. Safe and suitable even for little ones, indoor water wall features can create microbubbles that enchant you. The water bubbles, in addition to a \"wow\" effect on your guests, make the environment more livable and balanced.\nWater gives harmony and well-being to the body and mind. It is no coincidence that the Orientals (very attentive to body and mind balance) were the precursors of the use of these objects in domestic and business environments. Usually, the indoor water wall feature, equipped with a pump, appears as more or less compact panels in which the water flows inside tubular sections and with the most singular shapes, as well as from holes and stones. However, there is no shortage of original creations, such as the spheres or the windows, which are also customizable and have a hypnotic effect.\nIn any case, the flow of water generated by the refined water wall feature produces a particularly pleasant rustle that promotes calm, concentration and relaxation. The installation of an indoor water wall feature occurs quite quickly. It does not require masonry work or other invasive interventions, as it is sufficient to immerse the pump and connect it to the electricity.\nToday, there is no shortage of solutions for tasteful furnishing. Still, interior water walls can make the difference, given that they exploit a precious and natural element such as water to add that sophisticated touch to every room that never hurts.\nEven when it comes to maintenance, it is very minimal. There is also an interior water wall equipped with LEDs, i.e., variable color on command, to be adjusted according to specific preferences, thanks to which fascinating light effects and unique, exciting atmospheres can be created.\nhttps://www.midwest-tropical.com/\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Midwest Tropical, Inc.\nContact Person: Gregory Burnett\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 847-604-0925\nAddress: 3420 West Touhy Avenue\nState: Illinois 60076\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.midwest-tropical.com/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",
