    "text": "Vance accused Walz of 'stolen valor.' What to know about Walz’s military record For more on the 2024 race, head to [the NPR Network's elections updates page.](https://www.npr.org/sections/elections/) Late Tuesday afternoon, the Harris campaign released a [video of Tim Walz](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1820918063966962143) talking about gun control. Walz, whom Kamala Harris recently announced as her running mate, talks about banning assault rifles as part of what he calls “common sense” proposals. “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said in the video. That was all Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance needed. “Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this?” Vance said. The vice presidential candidate is supposed to be an attack dog, sometimes landing the lower blows that might seem unpresidential. But Vance and Walz are also both veterans, with another thing in common: neither one of them saw combat. Their [service](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/08/08/what-walz-has-said-about-his-military-record-as-others-criticized-it) shored up each ticket, adding a military credential beside two presidential candidates that never served. It didn’t seem like an issue. But in this compressed campaign season, Walz’s phrasing opened up a line of attack — and the Trump campaign took it, accusing the Minnesota governor of one of the most grievous charges possible in military circles. War, combat and service – and a charge of “stolen valor” Walz joined the National Guard at age 17 and served 24 years, first in Nebraska then Minnesota. During that time he got called up to national disasters and a deployment to the Arctic Circle in Norway. He completed his 20 years required for retirement in 2001, but then reenlisted after the attacks on Sept. 11. His only wartime deployment was to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan. So Vance, and many veterans on social media, took issue with Walz saying he’d carried weapons “in war.” The Harris campaign said in a statement: “In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\" But Vance went a lot further, with an attack that the Trump campaign probably had prepared. “What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said. Since Walz first ran for Congress and then governor, he’s faced attacks around the timing of his retirement. Vance’s accusation echoes one made by [two fellow high-ranking sergeants](https://www.wctrib.com/community/letters/the-truth-about-tim-walz) from the Minnesota Guard who publicly attacked Walz in 2018, in a paid endorsement letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune. They slammed Walz for “conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.” According to the Minnesota National Guard, Walz retired in May 2005, two months before his unit, the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in July 2005. It’s likely that Walz put in for retirement months before that May. It’s also clear that guardsmen anticipated deployment to Iraq months before July. According to several of his contemporaries in the guard Walz talked about it as a hard decision: that if he deployed he’d miss his best chance to run for Congress. “He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,” Allan Bonnifield, who served with Walz, [told Minnesota Public Radio](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/08/08/what-walz-has-said-about-his-military-record-as-others-criticized-it) in 2018. “He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn’t take that decision lightly at all.” The unit didn’t go to Iraq until March 2006, 10 months after Walz retired, where it stayed for a grueling 22-month extended deployment. The charge has dogged Walz, and in his last run for governor in 2022, it was even leveled by [a political opponent](https://www.startribune.com/walzs-24-years-in-national-guard-get-renewed-scrutiny-from-gop-opponent-who-didnt-serve/600216280) who never served at all. Walz’s rank The latest round of attacks on Walz stirred up another confusing point about his rank. Walz served as a command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank. But his retirement papers put him one step lower – a master sergeant. The Minnesota National Guard told NPR that Walz retired before completing academic requirements to keep the higher rank. “He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,” said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Augé, the Minnesota National Guard’s state public affairs officer. So while Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major, which also made him the highest enlisted member serving in Congress, and he can even get away with saying he retired as a command sergeant major, he cannot say he is a “retired command sergeant major.” On Thursday the Harris campaign [changed Walz’s official bio](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/08/harris-walz-military-credentials-00173236) on their website to reflect that. Charges of “swiftboating” Attacking an opponent’s military service has a short history in presidential campaigns – the verb “swiftboat” dates back only 20 years, when George W. Bush’s campaign [attacked combat-decorated John Kerry’s](https://www.npr.org/2004/08/09/3842725/the-battle-over-kerrys-vietnam-war-record) military service in Vietnam, which might have seemed risky since Bush avoided serving there. Donald Trump, who also avoided going to Vietnam, took the tactic to another level, attacking his GOP critic John McCain’s storied status as a POW. Now, Harris supporters are claiming that Vance is trying to “swiftboat” Walz, and even pointing to a member of the Bush-era campaign who is [now working for Trump](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-campaign-chris-lacivita-swift-boat-veteran.html). Veterans groups are generally keeping out of the fray; many veterans service organizations are on record praising the choice of two enlisted military veterans as vice-presidential nominees. “This means that regardless of the outcome in November, the next vice president of the United States will be a former enlisted service member. I am pleased to see both major parties recognize that military service is once again a valued experience in choosing the candidate for the second highest position in the country,” Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Al Lipphardt said in a statement.

    "text": "Social risk factors have a significant effect on health, with research suggesting social determinants of health (SDOH) might impact as much as 50% of county-level variation in health outcomes. While healthcare organizations are increasingly collecting social risk information, a lack of SDOH data standards is hampering their ability to use the data to improve health equity.\nAccording to a 2023 American Health Information Management Association survey , nearly eight in ten healthcare organizations report collecting SDOH data. However, organizations note challenges related to the collection, coding and use of the data.\nThe HL7 Gravity Project is looking to change that.\nBoosting SDOH data standards through collaboration Launched in 2019, the Gravity Project is a national public-private collaborative aimed at creating consensus-based data standards for SDOH interoperability across the health, social services, public health and research sectors.\nThe community includes over 2,500 stakeholders across healthcare, health IT, payers, community-based organizations, government agencies and research institutions like Regenstrief Institute.\n\"We all know that social risk factors play into clinical health, but we haven't really joined together the social risk factors formally from a data perspective,\" said Marjorie Rallins, DPM, MS, executive director of LOINC and health data standards at Regenstrief Institute.\nA new $4.4 million grant from the Regenstrief Foundation is looking to take the Gravity Project to the next level by standardizing social risk factors in appropriate terminologies. Rallins emphasized that the collaborative nature of the Gravity Project is key.\nWe all know that social risk factors play into clinical health, but we haven't really joined together the social risk factors formally from a data perspective. Marjorie Rallins DPM, MS, executive director of LOINC and health data standards, Regenstrief Institute \"It's definitely a multidisciplinary team,\" she said. \"They bring together the process and the right expertise and experts to the table in those various risk areas like food insecurity, education status, and incarceration history. All those things factor into your health picture, so it's important to have the right experts at the table who have a deep understanding of those social areas.\"\nOn the other hand, Regenstrief Institute brings a wealth of terminology expertise to the table as the organization behind LOINC, a widely used data standard.\nRallins likened the LOINC terminology standard to a lingua franca that aids interoperability across disparate health IT systems.\nFor example, one hospital system might use the term fever, another hospital might use the words elevated temperature, and a third facility uses the Latin term for fever, pyrexia.\n\"Those three things essentially mean the same thing, but unless there's something that says those all mean the same thing, then when you exchange data, you're not going to be able to reconcile that,\" Rallins explained.\nThat's where LOINC comes in, allowing stakeholders to compare the results of the same test or clinical observation across different institutions for patient care, research, quality assessment and outcomes management.\nSimilarly, encoding social risk factors using LOINC is set to streamline SDOH data exchange across various social risk screening tools and health IT platforms to ensure receiving systems can interpret the data.\nThe future of the Gravity Project The Gravity Project and Regenstrief Institute team plans to build a critical mass of standardized SDOH data elements over the next four years to benefit patient care and drive health equity research by helping better address patients' social and clinical needs comprehensively.\nSDOH data standards will also support population health efforts, allowing government agencies and healthcare organizations to track health inequities and evaluate the impact of interventions on care access, care delivery and health outcomes.\nThe initiative will focus on creating data standards across several social risk domains, which could include the following:\nNeighborhood safety. Access to green space. Food access. Adverse childhood experiences/toxic stress. Weathering. Minority strain. Immigration status. History of incarceration. Additional social risk domains are in the planning phases.\n\"Those social risk areas have data elements, and it's those data elements that we standardize with terminology like LOINC and SNOMED ,\" Rallins explained. \"Sometimes you have to use financial data, so you need CPT. Sometimes, you need more statistical data like ICD-10 , which is also used in billing. But all of that data has to be encoded in the appropriate terminology.\"\nAdditionally, Rallins pointed out that once the SDOH data standards are created, examining adoption will be critical.\n\"We need to study how people are using the screening tools that capture social risk data,\" she noted. \"That's the next phase because you have to have adoption and use in order for these to make some effective progress toward improving health outcomes.\"\nSo far, Regenstrief and the Gravity Project have coded about 18 social risk factors, Rallins said. However, she emphasized that the work surrounding SDOH standards does not end, as social risk areas are always evolving.\nHannah Nelson has been covering news related to health information technology and health data interoperability since 2020.\nRelated Resources Get Ahead of CMS' Interoperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule –ZeOmega Quick Answer: InterSystems’ Healthcare Industry Cloud Platform –InterSystems Dig Deeper on Interoperability in healthcare Regenstrief Updates LOINC with 800 Concepts for Health Data Exchange",

    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE – Ladd McConkey doesn’t know what his future holds beyond Saturday’s Orange Bowl, but there was absolutely no way he wasn’t going to take the field.\nConsidering the way back and ankle injuries kept him off the field this season, dadgum right he was going to play, health willing.\n“Heck yeah, especially with how many games I’ve missed this year,” McConkey said Thursday. “I’ve missed the first four, came back, and missed a couple of more after that, so any chance I can have to go out and play, oh my God, I’m going to do it and lay it all out there.”\nWhile he still may not be 100 percent from the ankle injury he suffered against Ole Miss, McConkey said he’s close.\nThe junior has taken part in practice unencumbered and is ready to play a big role for Georgia on Saturday in what may or may not be his last game in a Bulldog uniform.\n“I’m working back. Every single day I’m getting more confident, getting my feet back under me, just really getting my game back to where it needs to be,” McConkey said. “Game by game, I’m getting there.”\nAdvertisement “I’ve missed the first four, came back and missed a couple of more after that, so any chance I can have to go out and play, oh my God, I’m going to do it and lay it all out there.” — Ladd McConkey Offensive coordinator Mike Bobo plans on putting him to good use.\n“I wish I had him more. I know that,” Bobo said. “But it’s good to see him practicing. Tough, tough young man who has battled through some injuries. You hate to see that, but he’s worked hard to get back to play against Florida State. He’s one of the best route runners we have.”\nLike Georgia fans, Bobo will have to wait before learning if he’ll have McConkey for one more year.\nRight now, he just doesn’t know.\n“I guess you think about it. But also, I think about it, that it could be your last practice, it could be your last game,” McConkey said. “With the injury, especially, I’ve missed more than a couple of games, so I really challenge myself to go out and treat every game like it’s my last one.”\nAfter his ankle injury against Ole Miss took him longer to recover from than initially expected, he knows not to take anything for granted.\n“I kind of got rolled up on, got flipped. I really still don’t know what happened,” McConkey recalled. “I felt it, but I was like, aw, it’s nothing, you get rolled up on all the time. It just took a little longer than I expected.”\nMcConkey couldn’t see whether the fear of future injuries could make his decision academic.\nNeither could he say whether the return of quarterback Carson Beck could have a role in his return. The thought is at least an intriguing one.\n“I don’t know. It’s something I’ll have to think about,” McConkey said. “I don’t know right now, as I’m just focusing on this game. But it’s obvious he’s a special guy, a special player. I didn’t get to play with him much this year, so we’ll see.”\nLadd McConkey said the opportunity play in the Orange Bowl was an opportunity he couldn't decline. ",

    "text": "Los venezolanos que soliciten su ingreso a Perú, a partir del próximo 2 de julio de 2024, deberán presentar una visa y un pasaporte vigentes , después de 5 años de la suspensión de esos requisitos . Esto de acuerdo con una resolución de la autoridad migratoria publicada este jueves 27 de junio 2024.\nMás noticias Perú retira la transexualidad y el travestismo de trastornos mentales Empresas peruanas buscan negocios en Ecuador Ciudadanos venezolanos se aglomeran en la Casa de la Cultura en Quito La resolución de la Superintendencia Nacional de Migraciones , publicada en el diario oficial El Peruano , dispuso que, para efectos de control migratorio de ingreso al territorio peruano, los venezolanos tienen que presentar su pasaporte vigente . Además una visa otorgada por una oficina consular peruana, en el caso de que tenga la calidad migratoria temporal o residente.\nEn el caso de que tenga una calidad migratoria residente , en su versión humanitaria, como la que se emitió en los últimos años a raíz de la crisis política y social en Venezuela . Los beneficiados tienen que presentar esa visa humanitaria vigente , además de su pasaporte.\nMigraciones también aprobó, por única vez, la presentación de solicitudes de cambio de calidad migratoria a los venezolanos que tengan pasaportes vencidos . Esto, siempre que su último ingreso a Perú haya sido antes del 2 de julio próximo, y permanezcan en el territorio peruano , debiendo cumplir con los demás requisitos.\nLa norma también dejó sin efecto una resolución emitida el 12 de junio de 2019. Permitía que los venezolanos que pedían ingresar a Perú puedan hacerlo con el pasaporte vencido o partida de nacimiento para los menores de nueve años.\nLa flexibilización de requisitos migratorios para ingresar a territorio peruano generó varias olas de llegada de venezolanos al país. Además, forma un problema de seguridad ciudadana por la aparición de organizaciones criminales lideradas por personas de esa nacionalidad, según han manifestado las autoridades del Ejecutivo.\nEn lo que va del año, sólo se han producido 16 ingresos de venezolanos por estar en alguna situación de vulnerabilidad. Indicó la norma al justificar la suspensión de la resolución del 2019 que facilitó los ingresos con visa humanitaria y pasaportes vencidos.",

    "text": "El Ministerio de Economía, Planificación y Desarrollo publicó el estudio sobre “Índice de calidad del empleo en la República Dominicana”, que subraya la importancia de políticas públicas que fomenten la institucionalidad y mejoren el sistema educativo nacional para que converjan hacia un aumento de la productividad laboral y a un mayor crecimiento económico.\nEl documento destaca en sus conclusiones que el desarrollo viene con el empleo, pero no todos los empleos impulsan de igual manera el bienestar ni mejoran la calidad de vida de las personas en igual medida. “Para que esto suceda, los puestos de trabajo deben cumplir ciertos estándares, los cuales van más allá del nivel de ingresos de los ocupados o de la informalidad del empleo”, indica el documento.\nPlantea que las políticas de empleo deben todavía insistir en los aspectos de prestar atención especial a los grupos más vulnerables. Como ejemplo cita que las políticas de empleos focalizadas a los más jóvenes entre 15 y 24 años deben enfocarse en reducir las brechas de ingreso y las horas de trabajo, mientras que, en mayores de 60 años, además, de aumentar los niveles de ingreso, es imperativo mejorar el acceso a la seguridad social.\nSeñala que las actividades económicas con mayor concentración de empleo de calidad son administración pública y defensa (89.5%), salud y asistencia social (87.0%), electricidad y agua (86.6%), enseñanza (84.0%) e intermediación financiera (75.0%).\nAsimismo, puntualiza que los mayores niveles de precariedad se observan en agricultura y ganadería (88.6%), construcción (83.4%), transporte y comunicaciones (75.8%), otros servicios (74.8%), comercio (74.4%) y hoteles, bares y restaurantes (64.5%).\n“La actividad que ha mostrado mejor desempeño con relación al 2016 es hoteles, bares y restaurantes, con un incremento de 7.0 p.p. en la proporción de ocupados en empleos de calidad”, señala el documento.\nSituación de las mujeres\nSostiene que, con relación al servicio doméstico, las deficiencias en los niveles del ingreso y la seguridad social son muy importantes, representan también dificultades previsionales sobre salud y seguridad social a futuro.\nPor otro lado, los trabajadores independientes enfrentan las condiciones más precarias, aunque estos últimos presentan una relativa estabilidad laboral. Los niveles de ingreso de este grupo son equiparables a los del asalariado privado, pero no gozan de seguridad social, lo cual dificulta profundamente una previsión social mínima actual y a futuro.\nEstos resultados están relacionados con el alto nivel de informalidad del mercado laboral dominicano, lo que supone la necesidad de seguir implementando políticas eficaces de formalización del empleo, de tal manera que este grupo de ocupados acceda a mejores condiciones de trabajo y garantías previsionales de salud y retiro.\nEl documento es de la autoría de la directora de Análisis Económico Sectorial, Evalina Gómez; y las coordinadoras sectoriales, María Majluta, y Yelidá Blanco, del Viceministerio de Análisis Económico y Social.",

    "title": "Arsenal legend Thierry Henry is staggered by ex-Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe's prediction for Premier League top four | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Thierry Henry was not impressed by Jermain Defoe's prediction for the Premier League top four. The Arsenal legend made up one third of an elite striking trio of yesteryear during Amazon Prime's coverage of the Gunners' clash with West Ham on Thursday night. The France Under 21s boss joined Defoe and Alan Shearer for punditry duties as the former Tottenham star made his prediction for which teams would achieve Champions League qualification. 'City, Liverpool , Tottenham, Arsenal,' Defoe calmly replied to host Gabby Logan 's question, at which Henry responded in amazement. 'What?!' He said. 'What did you say? Tottenham?' But Defoe was unfazed. 'Why not?' he replied. 😂 @IAmJermainDefoe predicts this season's Premier League top four...\nThierry Henry does NOT agree! #PLonPrime pic.twitter.com/UgTfPtA0f3 Thierry Henry (middle right) alongside Alan Shearer (far left), Jermain Defoe (middle left) and host Gabby Logan (far right) for Amazon Prime's coverage of Arsenal v West Ham Your browser does not support iframes. Tottenham's top-four hopes were dealt a blow after a humbling 4-2 defeat by Brighton Henry's retort was justified after Ange Postecoglou 's side's defeat by Brighton less than an hour prior. Four unanswered goals, courtesy of a Joao Pedro brace and efforts from Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan, threatened to make for a humiliating night. Before Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies replied to salvage some pride from the trip to the south coast, giving the Tottenham faithful something to cheer. Defoe also glaringly omitted the only other side currently occupying a place in the top four - Aston Villa. Unai Emery's team suffered a bruising 3-2 defeat to Manchester United on Tuesday, having led by two goals to nil, but the result does not detract from their blistering start to the campaign that sees them sat in third on 39 points. Tottenham by contrast have amassed three fewer points than the Villans at the halfway point of the campaign. Henry hilariously gives Defoe a quizzical look after the Tottenham icon gives his prediction While Defoe and Shearer gave their top-four predictions, Henry amusingly refused to Spurs are now a point behind fourth-placed Man City, who have a game in hand on their rivals The question for each pundit's top-four prediction came in the aftermath of shocking result for Arsenal which saw them lose at home to West Ham courtesy of goals in either half from Tomas Soucek and Konstantinos Mavropanos. When asked for his own top four predictions, Henry defiantly said: 'No!' Asked if Arsenal's defeat at the Emirates was 'a blip' and if they're still real title contenders this season, Henry responded: 'When we are top of the table at Christmas, we usually lose the league so I'm kind of happy about that.' Shearer prodded Henry again to give his top four prediction, which again Henry amusingly stood his ground saying: 'I won't answer. Call me whatever you want. I always give my answer after the festive period. 'Talk to me in and around February. You can't call [the league] before that. You'll be guessing. I don't like to guess.' As it stands, Liverpool lead the way at the halfway point in the season, sitting atop of the table with 42 points after 19 games played. Arsenal also suffered defeat on the same night on their north London rivals on Thursday It's All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport that promises a different take on Premier League football, with a show every Monday and Thursday this season. It is available on MailOnline , Mail+ , YouTube , Apple Music and Spotify Your browser does not support iframes. The Gunners now trail Jurgen Klopp's side by two points - a stark contrast from before the game when a win over Hammers would've made them the outright leaders going into the new year. Aston Villa are a point behind the Gunners on 39 points while Man City are three points off Arsenal - but have a game in hand. Defeat for Spurs leaves them in fifth but now have West Ham and Man United breathing down their necks as we begin to learn who will be in the top four picture come the business end of the season.",
