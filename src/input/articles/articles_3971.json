    "text": "North Korea has gone quiet along its southern border, South Korea’s military said on June 12, marking a possible de-escalation in a year-long psychological standoff between the two Koreas. The shift came just one day after South Korean President Lee Jae-myung ordered a halt to Seoul’s anti-Pyongyang loudspeaker broadcasts — a symbolic yet sensitive gesture aimed at lowering tensions.“There were no North Korean loudspeaker broadcasts detected today,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, fueling speculation that Pyongyang may have responded in kind after Seoul pulled the plug on its own campaign at 2 p.m. the day before.The North’s noise broadcasts — a mix of static, propaganda and jamming signals — had continued in parts of the western front up until late June 11, but have since stopped entirely, according to the military. Broadcast patterns had previously varied across regions, but as of June 12, the border zone was silent on both sides.Seoul had reactivated its loudspeakers in June last year in retaliation for what it described as a series of provocations from Pyongyang, including missile launches and trash-carrying balloon campaigns. North Korea followed suit a month later, unleashing a barrage of sound from its own speakers — an echo of Cold War-era tactics.Now, both campaigns appear to be paused.President Lee, who has called for a “pragmatic but principled” approach to inter-Korean relations, framed the move as a gesture toward peace — and relief for civilians living near the heavily fortified frontier.“I ordered the military to suspend loudspeaker broadcasts toward the North as of 2 p.m. on June 11,” Lee said in a social media post. “This is to ease the suffering of residents in the border area who have endured the noise for far too long.”Lee added that he hopes the measure “will reduce military tensions and help rebuild trust between the two Koreas.”",

    "title": "Embracing a Precision Medicine Approach to KRAS G12C–Mutated Advanced NSCLC",
    "text": "Today, we understand that non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogenous disease that requires a precision medicine approach to improve outcomes for patients, explained Sandra Cuellar, PharmD, BCOP, FHOPA, FASHP, clinical associate professor and coordinator for oncology therapeutics in the Department of Pharmacy Practice at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Pharmacy, during a presentation at the Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association Annual Conference 2024 in Tampa, Florida.Until that truth was embraced, patient outcomes from treatment were consistently poor, according to Cuellar.1\\n\\n“When I came to UIC and treated patients with stage 4 [NSCLC], it was all the same. Everyone got [carboplatin and paclitaxel (carbotaxol)],” Cuellar said during the session. “That was based on the popular study that everyone should know: the Schiller [study].”1\\n\\nPublished in 2002, Schiller et al showed that carbotaxol had a lower rate of toxic effects than the other 2 regimens assessed, which included cisplatin and gemcitabine, and cisplatin and docetaxel. The authors observed that all 3 of these chemotherapy regimens in patients with NSCLC who have a good performance status could moderately improve survival at 1 and 2 years. Based on the results, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) chose carboplatin and paclitaxel as its reference regimen.2\\n\\n“The Schiller data told us that any platinum doublet is okay, but ECOG recommended carbotaxol,” Cuellar said during the session. “So that's all we did was carbotaxol, carbotaxol. When they would progress, they would go onto docetaxel.”1\\n\\nWith carbotaxol, progression-free survival (PFS) was about 10 months, according to Cuellar. If patients were given docetaxel monotherapy and combination options (docetaxel and ramucirumab) in the second-line, they would have suboptimal outcomes (mPFS=2.8 months and 4.5 months, respectively).1\\n\\n“Back then in my early years in oncology, I would go to ASCO, full of ambition and hear the data on [NSCLC]. It was one negative trial after another negative trial after another,” Cuellar said during the session. “Then finally the skies parted, and we recognized what we've known all along—that [NSCLC] is not a very heterogeneous disease, but we're treating it as a one size fits all. So, once we discovered and recognized [that] and created therapies to target that heterogeneity of disease, then we started making progress.”1\\n\\nFor this reason, for patients with NSCLC, when a mutation target is identified and treated with a targetable agent, outcomes are better than with systemic chemotherapy, according to Cuellar. Today, mutation targets consist primarily of KRAS G12C (14%) and EGFR (15%), although other mutations include ALK (5%), MET (3%), ROS1 (2%), BRAF (2%), HER2 (2%), RET (2%), PIK3CA (1%), NTRK1 (1%), as well as other KRAS mutations (11%), according to Cuellar.1\\n\\n“KRAS is an oncogene. I like to think about it as the name of the street. But that street has many different addresses,” Cuellar said during the session. “The point mutation that we’re talking about today is G12C, where there’s that single point mutation between 2 amino acids at codon 12. That single point mutation leads to uncontrolled proliferation of that cancer cell.”1\\n\\nThe therapy adagrasib (Krazati; Mirati Therapeutics) only targets KRAS G12C, which Cuellar explained is like the address on the oncogene street.1\\n\\n“The address is G12C on the KRAS street,” Cuellar said. “When we look at patients who have this particular mutation, it primarily is an adenocarcinoma, and a very small amount is squamous. These patients have a poor prognosis. In particular, these patients are known to develop [central nervous system (CNS)] involvement.”1\\n\\nSince the actual course of disease will eventually involve the CNS, the treatments selected should have CNS activity, Ceullar explained. A similar approach has played out in targeting mutations such as ALK as well, but in KRAS G12C, this approach is particularly important because a subset of patients is likely to develop CNS disease. Specifically, during the course of the disease, 40% of patients with KRAS G12C–mutated advanced NSCLC develop brain metastasis.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the KRYSTAL-1 trial (NCT03785249), patients were enrolled to assess the efficacy and safety of adagrasib in 116 patients with KRAS G12C–mutated, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The primary endpoint of the trial was objective response rate, which was 43% (n=116; 95% CI: 34-35). Secondary endpoints were median duration of response at 8.5 months (n=116; 95% CI: 6.2-13.8); median time to response at 1.4 months (n=116; 95% CI: 0.9-7.2); median overall survival at 12.6 months (n=116; 95% CI: 9.2-19.2); and median PFS at 6.5 months (n=116; 95% CI: 4.7-8.4).1\\n\\nBased on these data, adagrasib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2022, according to Ceullar. Additionally, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended adagrasib as a subsequent therapy option for patients with KRAS G12C–mutated advanced NSCLC after progression of disease.1\\n\\n“[Adagrasib] has a category 2A recommendation [from NCCN] in [NSCLC] and in the second-line setting in patients with KRAS G12C,” Ceullar said during the session. “[Adagrasib] also has a category 2A recommendation in CNS cancers for KRAS G12C.”1\\n\\n\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nCuellar S.

You can find them here:\nForbes Today's NYT 'Strands' Hint, Spangram And Answers For Thursday, June 27 By Kris Holt Hey, folks! I hope you’ve had a tremendous week. The weekend is close enough to taste, isn’t it?\nToday’s NYT Strands hints, spangram and answers are coming right up.\nHow To Play Strands The New York Times’ Strands puzzle is a play on the classic word search. It’s in beta for now, which means it’ll only stick around if enough people play it every day.\nThere’s a new game of Strands to play every day. The game will present you with a six by eight grid of letters. The aim is to find a group of words that have something in common, and you’ll get a clue as to what that theme is. When you find a theme word, it will remain highlighted in blue.\nYou’ll also need to find a special word called a spangram. This tells you what the words have in common. The spangram links at least two sides of the board, but it may not start or end there. While the theme words will not be a proper name, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will remain highlighted in yellow.\nMORE FOR YOU Biden Vs.

You can connect letters vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it’s possible to switch directions in the middle of a word. If you’re playing on a touchscreen, double tap the last letter to submit your guess.\nIf you find three valid words of at least four letters that are not part of the theme, you’ll unlock the Hint button. Clicking this will highlight the letters that make up one of the theme words.\nBe warned: You’ll need to be on your toes. Sometimes you’ll need to fill the missing word(s) in a phrase. On other days, the game may revolve around synonyms or homophones. The difficulty will vary from day to day, and the puzzle creators will try to surprise you sometimes.\nWhat Is Today’s Strands Hint? Scroll slowly! Just after the hint for today’s Strands puzzle, I’ll reveal what the answer words are.\nThe official theme hint for today’s Strand puzzle is...\nThat’s my jam!\nNeed some extra help? Here’s another hint...\nTypes of tunes\nThere are seven theme words to find today, including the spangram.\nWhat Are Today’s Strands Answers? Spoiler alert! Don’t scroll any further down the page until you’re ready to find out today’s Strands answers.\nI’ll first tell you the spangram and show you where that is on the grid. I’ll then tell you the other words and show you how they fit in.\nThis is your final warning!\nToday’s Strands spangram is...\nMUSIC GENRE\nHere’s where you’ll find it on the grid...\nThe rest of today’s Strands theme words are...\nSALSA SOUL BLUES JAZZ ROCK FOLK COUNTRY DISCO\nHere’s what the completed grid looks like...\nWithin seconds, I found BLUES, SALSA, SOUL and JAZZ in the top half of the grid.
