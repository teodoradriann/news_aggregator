    "text": "Author: Rashid Sumaila ( MENAFN - The Conversation) Amid the escalating threats of a warming world, and with the latest annual United Nations global climate conference (COP28) behind us, there is one critical message that's often left out of the climate change discourse. Halting overfishing is itself effective climate action.\nThis argument is the logical conclusion of a plethora of studies that unequivocally assert that stopping overfishing isn't just a necessity, it's a win-win for ocean vitality, climate robustness and the livelihoods reliant on sustainable fisheries.\nThe intricate relationship between climate change and ocean ecosystems was the subject of recent collaborative research - led by researchers at the University of British Columbia - that highlighted the crucial links between overfishing and climate change.\nFinding the connections Our collaborative team of international researchers applied a host of methodologies ranging from literature reviews to quantitative and quality analysis. The findings of this research illuminate eight key multifaceted impacts.\n1 - Ending overfishing isn't merely an ecological imperative but a vital climate action . Doing so would bolster marine life resilience in the face of climate shifts and reduce associate carbon emissions.\n2 - Large subsidized fishing boat fleets can actually be a burden on small-scale fisheries, leaving them disproportionately vulnerable to shocks . In turn, overfishing not only depletes resources but also escalates carbon emissions, intensifying climate impacts on these fisheries and their communities, particularly women .\nAdditionally, the vulnerability of shellfish fisheries to climate stressors further underscores the importance of adaptive strategies tailored to local conditions.\nOverfishing is an ecological and emissions crisis. (Shutterstock 3 - Success stories, like the recovery of European hake stocks, reveal a direct tie between stock recuperation and reduced emissions intensity from fisheries . We must champion and also learn from these successes .\n4 - Ecosystem-based fisheries management reverses the“order of priorities so that management starts with ecosystem considerations rather than the maximum exploitation of several target species.”\nEcosystem-based fisheries management has considerable potential to enhance sustainable catches while fostering carbon sequestration. This is perhaps best exemplified by the successful implimentation of ecosystem-based fisheries management in the western Baltic Sea .\n5 - Heavy metal pollution in the ocean - such as mercury or lead waste - intensifies the negative impacts of warming and overfishing . This pollution reinforces the need for developing multifaceted regulations based around ecosystem and ocean sustainability solutions.\nRead more: Flipping Indigenous regional development in Newfoundland upside-down: lessons from Australia\n6 - Overfishing exacerbates climate and biodiversity threats . Climate change contributes to less defined and predictable seasons and is causing reproductive challenges and the propagation of diseases in fish populations - among other issues.\nAdding to these problems, overfishing itself is altering ecological dynamics, modifying habitats and opening new pathways for invasive species . These compounding crises further exacerbate the impacts of overfishing on marine ecosystems while at the same time making fish populations more vulnerable to climate change.\nThe above factors all combine to reduce the catch potential in any given ecosystem. In turn, fishers are forced to venture farther and deeper in the ocean to fish - increasing carbon emissions, personal risk factors to fishers and bycatch concerns.\nReduced fish catches can lead to fishers going farther, and deeper, out to sea to find fish - with a host of associated consequences. (Shutterstock) 7 - International fisheries management must play a central role in promoting biodiversity and retaining the ocean's carbon sequestration potential. While 87 nations have signed the UN's Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction Treaty (also known as the High Seas Treaty), only one has ratified it. This treaty must be fully ratified and its effective implementation should be contingent upon the creation of marine protected areas that cover at least 30 per cent of the high seas.\n8 - The ocean has huge carbon sequestration potential. Shifting from the generally accepted maximum of sustainable yield management to maximizing carbon sequestration in fisheries management could further advance climate goals .\nFuture regulations should allocate a percentage of the annual fish quota to maintain the carbon sequestration function of marine animals. Simply put, beyond just being food, fish stocks serve vital carbon sequestration and biodiversity services that directly benefit humanity. Future regulations should reflect this reality.\nA simple goal This joint collaborative research underscores the urgency of this issue. Ending overfishing isn't just an ecological imperative but a linchpin for climate action. Furthermore, fisheries aren't mere victims in these dynamics, but have real agency to play a pivotal role in either exacerbating or mitigating climate change.\nRead more: The future of fishing and fish - and the health of the ocean - hinges on economics and the idea of 'infinity fish'\nAn ideal governance framework would focus on managing ecosystems with considerations for their diverse benefits, based on the best evidence available. Regulation of fisheries, while controversial, is essential to not overly exploit such a valuable public resource.\nAs we gear up to the next COP, we would do well to remember these conclusions. Without nurturing ocean life, addressing climate change becomes an uphill battle. Sustainable fisheries management is not just an ecological necessity. It is also the cornerstone of a resilient, sustainable future.\nMENAFN15022024000199003603ID1107859269\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "McAfee’s 2024 Global Holiday Shopping Scams Study Highlights Growing Concerns Over AI-Powered Scams, Including Deepfakes, Impacting Holiday Shoppers",
    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov 15, 2024--\nMcAfee Corp., a global leader in online protection, today released findings from its 2024 Global Holiday Shopping Scams Study, revealing how AI-driven scams and deepfake technology are impacting holiday shoppers. The study shows how AI-powered scams – including deepfakes – are more sophisticated than ever this season, putting shoppers at higher risk of losing money and changing the way people approach their holiday shopping.\nThe study reveals that holiday shoppers are on high alert, with 78% of Americans believing cybercriminals ramp up their activity during the holidays and 88% saying AI is impacting the number and sophistication of online scams during the holiday season. The rise in scams is fueling this anxiety, with 59% of Americans saying they’re more concerned about being scammed online than they were at this time last year.\nMcAfee Labs research indicates these concerns have merit, highlighting a significant surge in unsolicited holiday shopping emails starting in early October. Black Friday emails alone saw a 495% increase from October to early November. Similarly, Christmas-related emails rose by 314% during the same period. This trend suggests that scam-related risks will continue to escalate throughout the holiday season, and consumers should stay aware.\nIn a world where scammers can use AI-powered tools to create realistic fakes, even messages that appear to be from trusted brands should be closely examined. Emails and texts from trusted brands are top drivers for holiday shopping – 57% of Americans rank emails and 34% rank texts among their biggest motivators. However, many may be taking unnecessary risks when opening these messages: only about half of shoppers consistently verify a message’s authenticity, while nearly 1 in 3 check only sometimes, and close to 1 in 5 never check at all, leaving them vulnerable to scams disguised as real deals.\nIt’s not just traditional scam messages that are evolving; AI-generated deepfakes now pose a threat, especially to younger shoppers. While 1 in 5 Americans (21%) have unknowingly paid for fake products endorsed by deepfake versions of celebrities, the impact is greater among Gen Z and Millennials, with 1 in 3 people aged 18-34 falling victim to a deepfake scam, compared to around 5% of shoppers aged 55 and up.\n“The holidays are a season many look forward to – from consumers, to retailers, to cybercrooks,” said Abhishek Karnik, Head of Threat Research at McAfee. “Using AI-powered tools, scammers can now more quickly and easily create near-perfect imitations of trusted brand messages, celebrity faces and voices, and websites. We’re urging people to stay cautious, think twice about deals that seem too good to be true, and use the best online tools to protect their information. With the latest AI-powered protection, keep your guard up, think before you click, and stay one step ahead to keep your holiday season merry and safe.”\nTop Trends from the Global Holiday Shopping Scams Study\n1. Scam Messages are Surging\nToday, Americans are inundated with scam messages, many of which are AI-generated, and many are falling victim.\n- 64% of Americans receive most of their scam messages via email, 20% encounter them primarily via text, and 16% find them on social media.\n- 59% have seen fake missed delivery or delivery problem notifications, 44% received alerts about a purchase they didn’t make, 37% encountered messages claiming there’s an issue with their credit card or bank account needing urgent attention, and 35% reported seeing Amazon security alerts or notifications about account updates.\n2. Chasing Deals Can Be Costly\nWith inflation driving up prices, 84% of Americans are on the hunt for the best holiday deals, but the rush for discounts could put them at risk.\n- Over half (57%) are likely to start shopping earlier to snag savings.\n- 38% say they’d jump on a great deal as soon as they see it.\n- 1 in 5 (19%) are willing to buy from unfamiliar retailers if the price is right.\n3. Social Shoppers Face Evolving Risks\nMore than 100 million Americans are now shopping directly on social media, with platforms like Instagram and TikTok leading the charge in creating easy and accessible shopping experiences. While social shopping offers convenience, it also exposes consumers to new risks, especially as they shop while distracted – a significant risk, since just 59% of Americans feel confident they can identify deepfakes or AI-generated content on social media.\n- Shoppers are increasingly turning to social channels, with 12% planning to use TikTok Shopping, 7% planning to use Instagram Shopping, and 5% planning to use Pinterest.\n- 83% of Gen Z consumers say their shopping starts on social media.\n- 90% say they sometimes see ads from brands they've never heard of on social media.\n- 74% of Americans admit to taking an offbeat opportunity to make a holiday gift purchase online, including 62% in bed late at night when they should be asleep, 32% at work, 29% while on the toilet, and 11% in the bath.\nMcAfee’s Tips for Safe Holiday Shopping\nTo stay safe this season, McAfee recommends that you:\n- Think before you click. If you receive an email or text message asking you to click on a link, even if it’s a great-sounding deal or indicates it’ll provide useful information such as a package delivery update, it’s best to avoid interacting with the message altogether. Always go directly to the source and interact with reputable companies.\n- Use AI to beat AI. From blocking dangerous links that appear on text messages, social media, or web browsers, customers across all platforms can take advantage of the AI-driven technology behind\nText Scam Detectorto engage with text messages, read emails, and browse the web peacefully and securely. - Detect deepfakes. Look for slight inconsistencies in content. Is there unnatural blinking, odd eye movements, or\nunusual-looking hands or teeth? Does the audio not quite match the speaker’s lips or have a distorted quality? Invest in holistic online protection like McAfee+.Use products that provide maximum identity, privacy, and device protection. Help keep yourself and your family safe online with protection that detects and protects against suspicious links and sites (even those that promise to bring the latest in celebrity news!), so you can browse online with greater confidence.

    "text": "House Republicans argue Tim Walz's embrace of ESG for state pension fund raised energy costs The committee claimed that Xcel Energy, which is one of the country's largest electric and gas companies, was one of the corporations that caved to pressure from the climate cartel and made a series of \"net-zero\" commitments, which would raise its electricity prices in the midwest. The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday published an [interim staff report](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-10-24%20How%20Gov.%20Tim%20Walz's%20State%20Pub.%20Pension%20Fund%20Colludes%20with%20the%20Climate%20Cartel%20to%20Raise%20Energy%20Costs%20for%20Am.%20Consumers.pdf) that accuses Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's investment board of raising energy costs for consumers by using the state's retirement savings fund to pursue left-wing energy goals. Walz, who is currently running for vice president, is the chairman of the Minnesota State Board of Investment (MSBI). Under his tenure, Republicans say, the state's pension fund embraced environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Some states, [such as Kentucky](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/kentucky-bans-esg-investing-public-pensions), have banned asset managers handling state retirement systems from considering ESG factors when making investments with state funds over concerns that it doing so will result in a lapse of fiduciary duty to investors. The committee accused the MSBI of using $140 billion in the state pension fund to pursue those liberal ESG goals, and also accused it of colluding with other \"climate cartel investors\" behind the scenes that pushed Walz's “net-zero” climate campaign into the broader U.S. economy. The committee claimed that Xcel Energy, which is one of the country's largest electric and gas companies, was one of the corporations that caved to pressure from the climate cartel and made a series of \"net-zero\" commitments, which raised its electricity prices in the Midwest. \"In light of the continued collusion among climate cartel investors like the MSBI, the Committee’s investigation remains ongoing to inform potential legislative reforms,\" the committee said in a news release.

    "title": "Bangkok Post - Huawei innovates to support Thailand\"s renewable energy transition",
    "text": "These solutions empower residents, industries and smart grids to transition seamlessly to clean energy, address global warming, and also translate to significant cost savings on fuel and electricity.As Thailand moves towards becoming the regional Electric vehicles (EVs) hub, the transition to a greener energy structure is bringing ongoing investment opportunities and environment impact. To accelerate this process, technological innovation and proactive deployment is essential. In line with this trend, Huawei's digital power solutions aim to promote renewable energy adoption, encouraging both residents and businesses to embrace a sustainable future.Speaking at the ASEAN Sustainable Energy Week 2024 in Bangkok, Logan Yu, president of Huawei Thailand's digital power business, he emphasized that \"We all live in a world of energy: The tide ebbs and flows, the sun rises and sets, and the wind and clouds change. Energy surrounds us everywhere. The core question is how to use technology and digital means to better use renewable energy in our daily lives,\"He highlighted Huawei's digital power is committed to integrating digital and power electronics technologies to develop clean energy and energy digitalization, helping clean energy become a main energy source which is secure, stable, efficient, and easy to manage, and support energy security and energy efficiency innovation throughout Thailand.Apart from green home scenarios, industrial and data center sectors are increasingly turning to renewable energy to reduce electricity costs and achieve carbon neutrality with scalable effect.ULTRA-FAST CHARGINGFollowing a successful rollout in China, Thailand is the first country in Asia Pacific region where Huawei has introduced the FusionCharge Liquid-cooled Ultra-fast Charging Solution, also known as the ‘Liquid-cooled Power Unit'.To build a user-friendly, grid-friendly and operation-sustainable Smart Charging Network, is very important for both the EV industry and EV drivers.Huawei Full Liquid-cooled Ultra-Fast Charger offers a better experience with charging speed of 200 kilometers in five minutes, or 1 second per km. This makes it the fastest EV charging system in the market, Mr. Yu said.\"The Liquid-cooled system reduces heat compared to air-cooled charging, which generates excess heat and takes 15-20 minutes to complete the charging. This innovation addresses a major pain point for EV users,\" he added.\"This is a significant leap forward for Thailand's growing of smart technology infrastructure and future trend smart charging and clean energy,\" Mr. Yu said.The power unit boasts a maximum power output of up to 720 kilowatts, quieter overall operation, and a unit lifespan of up to 10 years. It adopts a power-sharing matrix to save power grid capacity and improve power utilization, supporting 4-12 charging connectors or dispensers.Although the capital expense of this solution is higher than that of a conventional charging station, it offers a quicker return on investment within three years. \"Fast charging increases turnover for car charging users, and the system can allocate power to other connectors if a user is parked for an extended period,\" Mr. Yu explained.High quality charge network, is demanding in Thailand.Huawei GREEN HOME Revolutionizing Household EnergyTraditionally, many households have adopted small-capacity solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for specific needs, such as solar water heating systems.However, after years of research and development, Huawei Digital Power launched a comprehensive GREEN HOME solution catering to all home energy scenarios, marking a significant leap towards sustainable living.The GREEN HOME solution highlights more advanced technologies, which include: Battery Energy Storage System (BESS): Featuring a 10-year warranty and adhering to stringent safety standards, the BESS eliminates fire risks, ensuring peace of mind for users. Optimizer: This device enhances safety by reducing the voltage to a secure 30V within 30 seconds. AI-Powered Management System: Leveraging artificial intelligence, this system dynamically manages solar energy, BESS, AC charger and grid systems based on consumption behavior, Big-Data, and predictive algorithms, optimizing energy efficiency. Notably, the system is scalable up to 83 kWh, accommodating varying energy needs and being adjustable for upgrade and scaling. With Huawei BESS solution, house owners are able to store excess solar energy during daytime and utilize the energy when needed. Therefore, Huawei GREEN HOME solution enable solar energy from day to night. Paving the Way to Carbon NeutralityThe GREEN HOME system, now more than just a concept, is poised to play a pivotal role in Thailand's 2050 carbon neutrality roadmap. By providing a robust and adaptable energy solution, Huawei Digital Power is empowering households to contribute to a sustainable future.Recently, the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) announced that the new tax reduction scheme for households installing rooftop solar panels is expected to be finalized by July 2024. Any household purchasing solar roof solution with a power generation capacity less than 10 kilowatts can participate in the program with a maximum 200,000 THB tax deduction. The DEDE expects 90,000 households to participate within the next 2 years. With this announcement, we can expect the rise of solar roof users in households - paving the way to carbon neutrality in Thailand's household.Logan Yu, President of Huawei Digital Power Thailand, highlighted the significance of this innovation, stating, \"Our GREEN HOME systems are designed to support Thailand's journey towards carbon neutrality by 2050. Through integrating advanced digital and power electronics technologies, we aim to make clean energy a mainstay in every household, ensuring energy security and efficiency across the nation.\"As Huawei Digital Power continues to drive clean energy advancements, the GREEN HOME solution stands as a testament to their dedication to environmental sustainability and technological innovation.",

    "title": "Digital Addiction in Children: A growing concern and the need for balanced technology usage",
    "text": "Digital addiction in children is defined as excessive dependence on digital devices and online content. With the easy availability of digital devices like mobile phones, tablets and computers, children are increasingly exposed to digital addiction. They use these devices for social media, web browsing and online video gaming. This leads to dangerous over exposure, resulting in excessive screen time, reduced physical activity, social isolation and difficulty in forming real-life connections.\nChildren are the most vulnerable to digital addiction, as they are at a developmental stage where digital gadgets are highly enticing. Their developing brains are more prone to addiction than those of adults. The growing amount of time children spend on electronic devices has become a significant concern in our increasingly connected world. According to a survey by Baatu Tech, “60 percent of children exhibit behaviors indicative of potential digital addiction, and 85 percent of parents express difficulties in managing their children’s online consumption.” The survey highlighted gaming and social media as the two most dominant platforms frequented by children.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed significant concern about digital addiction among Children. In 2020, the WHO officially recognized digital addiction as a global issue, noting that excessive use of digital devices leads to poor time management, reduced energy and attention spans, and disturbed sleep patterns or insomnia. According to the WHO, digital addiction among children is a growing concern, with guidelines recommending that children under 2 years old should have no screen time at all, while those aged 2-5 years should be limited to a maximum of one hour per day, with high- quality content and parental supervision.\nDigital addiction among children is now considered more dangerous than drug addiction. Studies have found that internetaddiction is four times more harmful than drugs, damaging brain development to levels comparable with cocaine addiction. Nathan Driskell, a therapist in Texas, USA, states, “Digital addiction is worse than alcohol or drug abuse because it is more engaging and lacks the stigma associated with substance abuse.\nIn Kashmir, experts have recently voiced their concerns about the growing issue of digital dependency among children. They termed it an “invisible pandemic” that is causing a severe impact on children’s mental, physical, and social well being. The experts emphasized the need for interventions, including medical guidelines for healthy digital media usage. They stressed the importance of nurturing and protecting children within environments that promote overall development.\nCreating awareness and engaging in discussions about the costs and consequences of unrestricted digital access is crucial. Parents, educators, and society must recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy and balanced relationship with technology. It is our collective responsibility to guide children with wisdom, balance and proper care. We must teach them to use technology responsibly, encourage healthy screen habits, and foster real-world interactions. By creating a supportive environment, we can help children navigate the digital world safely while benefiting from technology’s potential for learning and growth.\n(Author can be reached at: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f99b988a91908b948c8398949095cdc1b99e94989095d79a9694))",

    "text": "MOORESVILLE, N.C. — \"Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen,\" Yes, that's right — one North Carolina woman is having the time of her life.\nIt started in 1992 when Cinamon Loyd was crowned Miss Statesville where she also found her future husband during the pageant. From there, she went on to compete in the Miss North Carolina pageant but she did not win.\n“The Miss America program, to be on that stage, was more like a fantasy,” Cinamon said.\nThirty years later, her daughter Taylor Loyd won the Miss Stateville crown. She also went on to win Miss North Carolina — making her mother proud. Despite the family history in pageants, Taylor Lord didn’t compete in her first pageant until she was 13.\n“When I decided I wanted to compete, I kind of had to convince them. They wanted to make sure I was serious about it,” Taylor Lyod said.\nNow, Taylor Loyd will head to Orlando, Florida next week to prepare for the Miss America pageant held Jan. 6th through the 14 at the Dr. Phillips Center for Performing Arts.\nOnly one Miss North Carolina has ever won Miss America and that was in 1962.\nTaylor Loyd is from Mooresville. She is a senior music and public policy major at UNC-Chapel Hill and plans to use the scholarship she won at Miss North Carolina to attend graduate school.\nStay connected to local, national, and breaking news: Download the WFMY News 2 app.\n► Text the word APP to 336-379-5775\n► DOWNLOAD FOR IPHONE HERE\n► DOWNLOAD FOR ANDROID HERE\nRELATED: NBA star takes 5 Greensboro teens on a Christmas trip to Miami\nRELATED: 3-time cancer survivor, Johnny Van Kemp collects toys for sick kids\nRELATED: Stories from the Triad that touched your heart in 2023\nMORE WAYS TO GET WFMY NEWS 2\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter Let’s Get 2 It!\nDownload the WFMY News 2 APP from your Apple or Google Play store.\nADD THE WFMY+ APP TO YOUR STREAMING DEVICE\nROKU: Add the channel from the ROKU store or search for WFMY.\nAmazon Fire TV: Search for WFMY to find the free app to add to your account.
