    "text": "In an era where the clamor for sustainable solutions has reached a crescendo, two industry titans, Lenzing and HeiQ Group, chart a course towards a greener horizon. Lenzing, a venerated name in the production of regenerated cellulosic fibers, has recalibrated its climate objectives to resonate with the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement, aiming to cap the human-induced global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, HeiQ Group steps into the future with the appointment of Julien Born as CEO of HeiQ AeoniQ Holding, steering the helm of HeiQ AeoniQTM, a pioneering sustainable cellulosic filament fiber, towards commercial viability and beyond.\nForging the Future of Fiber\nIn a world grappling with the consequences of climate change, the quest for sustainable materials has never been more pressing. HeiQ AeoniQTM emerges as a beacon of hope, embodying the synthesis of innovation and sustainability. Under the stewardship of Julien Born, whose pedigree spans prestigious tenures at DuPont, KOCH Industries, and The LYCRA Company, HeiQ AeoniQTM is on a trajectory to redefine the textile industry's landscape. The commercial production of this groundbreaking technology is slated for 2025 in Portugal, marking a significant milestone in the journey towards environmental stewardship.\nA Landmark Investment in Sustainability\nThe commitment of HeiQ Group to this endeavor is underscored by a robust investment strategy. With a €5M acquisition of land and buildings coupled with an €80M infusion into the construction of a 15,000m2 facility, HeiQ is laying the groundwork for a sustainable future.

Prior to joining FI$Cal, Amit worked in the private sector in the San Francisco Bay Area, Texas, Canada and India. During that time, he managed profit and cost centers, technology businesses and large teams. The following commentary was published this week by the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal). Just in time for October’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month, the Department of FI$Cal (the Financial Information System for California) is pleased to announce its Amit has a Bachelor of Technology degree in electronics and communication engineering from Indian Institute of Technology – Kharagpur; a Master of Business Administration from Indian Institute of Management – Ahmedabad; a Master’s in computer engineering from Concordia University – Montreal; and a Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from Texas A&M University. He holds several security-related industry certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Cloud Security Professional, and Computing Technology Industry Association Security; he has also published several technical articles. At FI$Cal, Amit intends to improve the maturity of our security operations and continue to develop our security staff’s technical and collaborative skills. In recognition of Social engineering, a common form of cyber attack, uses deception to manipulate individuals into sharing confidential or personal information. Phishing attacks are a common type of social engineering, where bad actors send information, usually via email, that purport to be from a company or someone the individual knows; they request the person to click on a link to download information, or to send sensitive information. Individuals should be careful when clicking on links or divulging sensitive information. But email phishing isn’t the only way social engineering attacks may come. Now, with artificial intelligence, attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Today, AI is being used to create sophisticated deceptions and is one of the newest ways people and organizations can fall victim to cyber attacks. AI technologies are capable of mimicking a human’s voice, intonations, styles, facial features, gaits, etc. to carry out human-like live conversations over phone, video or via chat. These “deepfakes” are the latest methods being used to trick people into taking action they otherwise would not. Current news and law enforcement agency warnings prove that these capabilities are actually being used at a large scale to impersonate our colleagues, customers and supervisors, to manipulate us into doing things that can lead to a cyber attack or fraud. Take time to identify ways to spot an AI deepfake, including identifying unnatural facial movements, out-of-sync voices, or other AI “tells.” Cybersecurity is all of our responsibility. It’s always a good idea to start questioning, start reflecting, start looking for security weaknesses while on the job and at home. People are our most valuable and important resource when it comes to thwarting a cyber attack. Thank you, Amit, and welcome to FI$Cal!

He shared the following tips:Be on Guard Against Social Engineering Social engineering, a common form of cyber attack, uses deception to manipulate individuals into sharing confidential or personal information. Phishing attacks are a common type of social engineering, where bad actors send information, usually via email, that purport to be from a company or someone the individual knows; they request the person to click on a link to download information, or to send sensitive information.

    "text": "La primera Semana Nacional de Vacunación 2025 dará inicio este sábado 26 de abril y se extenderá hasta el 3 de mayo. Más allá del anuncio logístico, la advertencia de fondo revela una situación delicada, ya que en el estado hay presencia confirmada de tosferina y sarampión, enfermedades altamente contagiosas que, en casos graves, pueden provocar complicaciones severas, discapacidad e incluso la muerte, sobre todo en la población infantil, informó Adriana Jiménez Montejo, coordinadora de vacunación del Distrito Sanitario para el Bienestar número tres.\nA diferencia de campañas anteriores, esta jornada se enfocará prioritariamente en completar esquemas de vacunación para niños y adultos, aclarando que no se aplicarán biológicos de manera indiscriminada, sino únicamente a quienes lo necesiten.\nNoticia Destacada\nNo hay vacunas contra Sarampión en Campeche; registra desabasto por la alta demanda de contagios\n“Es una vacunación dirigida a quienes estén carentes de algún biológico o les falte completar el esquema. Lo importante es que las personas acudan con su cartilla para revisar si falta alguna dosis y así poder completarla”, explicó Jiménez Montejo.\nLa funcionaria enfatizó que todas las vacunas del esquema básico estarán disponibles, y que hay suficientes dosis para atender la demanda. Se instalarán puestos fijos en centros de salud, hospitales como el Hospital Rural IMSS-Bienestar María del Socorro Quiroga Aguilar, así como en todas las instituciones de salud: IMSS, ISSSTE, Hospital Naval, Pemex, además de módulos móviles en puntos estratégicos, como entradas de supermercados o sedes del bienestar social municipal.\n🦠 UN CONTEXTO EPIDEMIOLÓGICO PREOCUPANTE\nSegún la coordinadora de vacunación, el actual panorama con tosferina y sarampión vuelve a poner en el centro del debate la urgencia de fortalecer la cultura de vacunación, especialmente tras los efectos de la pandemia de COVID-19, que dejó secuelas en la cobertura y seguimiento de los esquemas básicos.\nRecordó que la vacunación es un derecho universal, por lo que no importa la afiliación a una institución de salud pública, cualquier persona podrá recibir la vacuna. Sin embargo, organizaciones civiles han denunciado en años anteriores la falta de acceso real en comunidades rurales o marginadas, donde los módulos no siempre llegan.\n“La clave ahora será asegurar que la información, la logística y la empatía lleguen a todos los rincones, y que más allá de la disponibilidad en papel, la vacuna llegue al brazo que más la necesita”, concluyó.",
