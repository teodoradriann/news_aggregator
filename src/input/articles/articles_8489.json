    "text": "Uran hospital overflows with grief\nMUMBAI: A naval speedboat collided with the Neel Kamal ferry, drowning 14 passengers, leaving survivors and families in shock and grief.\nMUMBAI: When rescue operations were called off on Wednesday evening, after naval speedboat dashed against a passenger ferry, Neel Kamal, near Butcher Island in the afternoon, leading 14 individuals to meet their watery graves, survivors and family members were left with a mix of emotions at such a turn of fate – grief, anger, disbelief.\nMost of the passengers who had set sail for a trip to Elephanta Island from the Gateway of India, belonged to the working class, who were either visiting the city from nearby districts or far-flung states, for work or simply to experience a bit of Mumbai. Those on the passenger ferry included co-workers who had some time on hand after completing their businesses to unwind or extended family members looking to bond with each other, there were also young parents who wanted to experience the sea with their children.\nMany suffered losses.\nLate in the night, HT visited Indira Gandhi Hospital, in Uran, where post-mortems were being conducted – cops from Mora and Uran police stations, and doctors in the forensic department, were busy at work, as the dead were being wheeled in.\nBy 2 am relatives of the deceased had gathered at the hospital after getting news of their losses – one had lost an infant, a senior citizen’s entire family was wiped away, a sister ready to be wed in a week lost her brother, a young woman lost her elderly mother. Grief was the one emotion binding all.\nSome expressed themselves in bouts of tears, others simply sat still in a state of shock. A few managed to muster up the courage to share their pain.\n‘I am hoping my son is alive’\nAshraf Pathan, 42, a cloth merchant from Mapusa, Goa, was in Mumbai on Wednesday on business. As his family had not been to Mumbai before, Ashraf had decided to turn this into a work-and-pleasure trip, and brought along his wife, Safeena, 35, their 10-month-old child Aazaan, seven-year-old son Zohan and his sister-in-law, Sonali Gavandar.\nAfter a spot of sightseeing and a visit to Haji Ali Dargah, the family decided to sail to Elephanta Island from the Gateway of India in a passenger ferry.\n“Our peaceful boat ride was interrupted when a speedboat from the Navy crashed into our ferry. We were on the upper deck enjoying the sights and in no time felt the boat sinking. Everyone rushed to get hold of lifejackets in the overcrowded lower deck,” said Ashraf. In the melee, Safeena and Zohan became stuck in the lower deck among the crowd while Ashraf, Aazan and Sonali scampered up, without any protective gear.\n“My wife and older son drowned with the others, while I along with my younger son and sister-in-law managed to hold on to a plastic barrel in the water which saved us from drowning. Others also held on to the barrel and we managed to create a human chain mid-sea,” said Ashraf.\n“We had no option but to patiently wait for help. All the while, I was constantly looking for my wife and son but did not find them anywhere.”\nAfter half an hour the three saw several private boats approaching the capsized vessel. By now, water had started percolating into the plastic drum and it had begun to sink. “Had help arrived even five minutes late, I would not have been here to tell you the story,” said a grief-stricken Ashraf. The three were taken to JNPA Hospital, in Uran, for physical checks, and released soon. His wife’s body was sent to Indira Gandhi Hospital, Mora, along with the other dead. There has been no news yet about his son.\nAshraf hopes Zohan is missing but alive. “I am waiting for a message from authorities saying he is admitted in a hospital and safe,” he said.\nThe family was supposed to return to Goa on Wednesday night but he will now “return without two members of my family”.\n‘He lost all 3 members of his family’\nResidents of Pimpalgaon Baswant, 30 kilometers from Nashik district, Rakesh Nanaji Ahire, 38, his wife Harshada, 35, and their son Nidhish, 7, along with his father-in-law Kailash Govind were in the city to seek medical follow-up advise for a surgery in the nose Rakesh had undergone nine years ago. As the consultation with the doctor in Andheri West ended early on Wednesday, the family decided to visit Elephanta Island.\nThe elderly Kailash stayed back, while the other three set sail on Neel Kamal. They drowned when the boat capsized after a naval speedboat rammed into it.\n“Govind remained on the shore and watched the others sail into the sea from the Gateway,” said Akshay Sonawane, a relative, “as he is afraid of the water.”\nOn hearing the news of the deaths and identifying the bodies at Indira Gandhi Hospital, Uran, he slipped into a state of shock and became speechless. Doctors who examined him said his blood pressure had shot up.\nAkshay Sonawane, Rakesh’s cousin, said, “Govind, used to live in Mumbai and only recently shifted to Nashik after retirement. His son-in-law Rakesh, a building contractor, who had undergone surgery on his nose in 2015 would come to Mumbai for routine check-ups.”\nWhen they visited the city, Rakesh and his family lived in Govind’s flat in Kalyan. “Govind called us soon after getting the news,” said Akshay, adding that “police took him to Mora port, on the other side of the harbour, along with other survivors from Neel Kamal”.\n“He is still trying to come to terms with the fact that he lost his only daughter, son-in-law and grandson, with a single tragic turn of fate,” said Akshay.\n‘He had sent selfies to his sister’\nLike many others in the ill-fated ferry, Neel Kamal, Mohammad Rehan Qureshi and his employer Abhijeet Singh, were visiting Mumbai for the first time. The garment traders from Muzaffarpur, Bihar, were here on business. On Wednesday, after wrapping up work, the two decided to go on a boat ride to Elephanta.\nWhile Rehan perished in the accident, Abhijeet was rescued.\nAn officer from Mora police station said, “Rehan sent some photos, such as selfies taken on the ferry, to his sister, updating her about their Mumbai trip. Later, when the news about the boat accident appeared on television, the family tried to reach him. They failed as his phone was switched off. Anxious, they reached out to Mokim Raza, a relative from Navi Mumbai, who told them to keep calm, as there is weak cell phone network in Elephanta and that he might be stuck somewhere due to the accident.”\nSoon after, the family received a call from Mora port police, informing them about Rehan’s death. His body was fished out by cops in Uran. “Constable Tushar Patil of Mora police station removed the SIM card from Rehan’s defunct phone, inserted it in his phone and called the family,” said the police officer.\nRaza said, Rehan’s sister was to be wed on December 27.\n‘We have not informed her of her mother’s death yet’\nSixty-year-old Rama Rati Devi Gupta, a native of Uttar Pradesh, was in the city to attend her nephew Gautam Gupta’s marriage, which took place on December 11.\n“After the wedding, Gautam, a Nalasopara resident, decided to take them on a Mumbai darshan. Gautam, Rama and her daughter Ranita, set out for Elephanta Island,” said Ajay Gupta, son-in-law of Rama, who perished in the water.\nWhen the crash with the naval speedboat occurred, Gautam grabbed Ranita’s hand, to take her to safety. He found a wooden plank floating by and led Ranita to it. He swam back to find his aunt, but she had drowned by then. “He swam back to the wooden plank and both he and Ranita were rescued by one of the speedboats that had arrived by then to help passengers,” said Ajay, adding Gautam and Ranita are admitted in St George Hospital. “We have not broken the news of her mother’s death to Ranita.”\n‘I regret not being on the ferry’\nThe Pavaras from Dhule district were in Mumbai to see the sights. Of the eight members of the extended family, Sairam and his cousin decided to stay back on at the Gateway, while other family members set sail in Neel Kamal for Elephanta Island. After the crash, while all the others were rescued, Sairam’s three-year-old daughter Mahi was fished out of the waters.\n“When we were informed by a cousin who was on board about the incident, we rushed to the Colaba beat chowky (located at Gateway of India) to inform the police about the accident,” said Sairam, who owns a medical store in Dhule.\n“All my relatives tried to search for Mahi after the boat capsized, but she went somewhere deep in water; they could only find her body,” he said, adding, “My only regret is that I wasn’t on the boat. I could have saved her.”\nSairam’s pregnant wife has been admitted in St George’s Hospital. “We have not informed her about Mahi,” said Rajesh Pavara, uncle of the deceased.\nMotor mechanic, co-worker were deployed on Navy boat\nHyderabad resident Trilekar Deepak worked as a motor mechanic with a company that supplies boat engines and accessories to the Navy for the past five years. He would visit Mumbai on assignment for 7-10 days every now and then and was on board when the Navy speedboat crashed into the ferry on Wednesday, killing him and several others. He was accompanied by his coworker Pravin Ramnath Sharma, who was also killed in the accident.\n“The speedboat crashed into the ferry with such speed that Deepak’s body was flung in the air and into the ferry and he died immediately,” said his coworker, Noor Shaikh, as he helped his brothers from Hyderabad collect his body following the postmortem at JJ Hospital.\nDeepak was the youngest of five brothers and two of them flew down to Mumbai on Wednesday night after being informed about the incident at around 8pm, said Shravan Kumar, his elder brother, 32.\n“We will take the body to Hyderabad where our mother is waiting,” he said.\nSocial worker had a habit of escaping by himself\nDeepchand Waghchaure – a plumber and social worker who lived in Govandi with his wife, 17-year-old daughter, and 10-year-old son – had a habit of escaping all by himself, unbeknownst to his family. But when he didn’t pick up his daughter from college in the evening and calls to him went unanswered, they started worrying and called his uncle Dilip Gawade.\n“We checked with many relatives, even as far as Nerul, to see if anyone had heard from him,” said Gawade. Neighbours and family friends also joined in the search, asking others about him, till they heard of the mid-sea accident and checked at the Colaba Police Station with a sinking feeling.\n“We thought he might be injured, but then, the police directed us to JJ Hospital to verify if his body was among those dead. The worst possible thing had happened,” said Gawade, who accompanied Waghchaure’s family to JJ Hospital to collect his body.\nBhima Lokhande, another friend of the deceased who accompanied the family said Waghchaure was wearing a lot of gold, of which the police had returned only 20 tola. “We don’t know what happened to the rest,” he said.\nMechanical engineer was found via phone location\nBadlapur resident Mangesh Mahadev Kelshikar had been working as a mechanical engineer for nearly eight months with a company contracted by the navy. He was on board the navy speedboat conducting engine trials when it crashed into the ferry on Wednesday and was killed instantly due to the impact of the accident.\n“We called him around 8pm after we heard of the accident but he didn’t pick up,” said his brother Mahesh. “Sick with worry and scared, we called everyone we knew of from his company but got little concrete information. Finally, we traced him via his mobile phone location and were led to Mora Hospital in Uran where we found his body.”\nThe only breadwinner of his family, Kelshikar is survived by his mother, four-month pregnant wife and four-year-old son. “His mother is inconsolable and still crying,” said Mahesh as her grandson comforted her, urging her to drink water while dabbing at her tear-stained face.\n[Explore now!](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket?utm_source=eoa&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=crickit)\nStay updated with all the\n[Breaking News](https://www.hindustantimes.com/)and\n[Latest News](https://www.hindustantimes.com/latest-news)from\n[Mumbai](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news).

The prime minister also laid the foundation stone of other solar projects in the state. Addressing the event through videoconferencing, Modi said that the country has started moving at a fast pace in generating solar power, and in giving an impetus to this mission, today, the foundation stone has been laid for various solar power projects in Rajasthan. The projects, he said, will not only give green and cheap power to the region but also provide great employment opportunities to the youth. The total cost of NLC India's solar project is estimated at Rs 1,756 crore and it is scheduled to be commissioned in September, the public sector enterprise said in a statement. The project is strategically located near the existing Barsingsar Thermal Power Station which offers advantages in power evacuation through the existing network and utilisation of common infrastructure facilities. The company said that it has signed a power usage pact with Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd for the entire capacity of 300 mw at a tariff of Rs 2.52 per unit. NLC India is a navratna company under the coal ministry. (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "El PP defiende la concesión del monasterio de San Clodio ante las críticas del BNG\nNoa Presas tildó de “escandalosa” la situación del enclave\nREDACCIÓN\nLa concesión del monasterio de San Clodio levantó ayer polémica en el Parlamento de Galicia. La diputada del\nBNG Noa Presas tildó de “escandalosa” la situación del enclave y aseguró el “incumplimiento sistemático” de los términos de la concesión por parte de la empresa que actualmente gestiona el hotel-monumento. En esa línea, recordó las quejas de los vecinos de la zona sobre los “largos periodos” de cierre de las instalaciones. “Esto sucede con la dejadez, pasividad e indiferencia del Gobierno del PP, que tiene que poner final a uno de los mayores escándalos de la Xunta en la comarca de O Ribeiro”, reclamó. Presas solicitó la creación de una “mesa de trabajo” para abordar la situación de custodia, acceso y usos del monumento, así como la finalización de la concesión el próximo año, después de 25 años. “No hay garantías de valorización patrimonial ni de apertura, pese a ser un monumento BIC, lo que implica una serie de obligaciones por ley”, añadió.\nLa nacionalista también solicitó que se remita al Parlamento la documentación referente a los antecedentes y a la situación del monasterio, especialmente el convenio firmado entre Xunta, Obispado de Ourense, Comunidad Benedictina de Samos y Concello de Leiro.\nPor su parte, el diputado del PP José Luis Ferro remarcó el “permanente contacto” de la Xunta con el Concello de Leiro y con la empresa concesionaria del monasterio, en favor de “alternativas en positivo” para que el establecimiento sea un “polo tractor de turismo”, no solo para la provincia, sino para el conjunto de Galicia. Ferro consideró “innecesaria” la creación de la mesa solicitada por Presas, y avanzó que el Gobierno autonómico “continuará con su tarea de interlocución con todos los agentes implicados” en el funcionamiento de las intalaciones turísticas. “Seguiremos monitorizando las nuevas necesidades que puedan surgir al respecto del entorno del Hotel-Monumento, ponderando los intereses públicos y la mejor oferta hostelera posible para generar emplego y dinamizar el territorio, siempre conjugado con la mejor prestación de servicios a los clientes”, resaltó.\nProductores, tintores, diseñadores y las lanas del mundo en el Paseo de la Lana La enfermera de los 135.000 seguidores La Comisión de Centro urge una cita con la gerencia ante el “mal estado” del paritorio Desarticulado un grupo criminal que robaba camiones para vender la mercancía tras actuar en Ourense Rescatan a un hombre cuyo coche cayó 15 metros abajo desde un puente, en Bande Informáticos y sanitarios crean una aplicación para agilizar el diagnóstico a través de rayos X “Es un error plantear las relaciones sentimentales desde una perspectiva romántica” Cinco detenidos por tráfico de drogas e intervenidas 600 plantas de marihuana en una nave de Amoeiro",

Juni) seine Angriffe unter dem Namen „Operation Rising Lion“ – und zielte dabei nach eigenen Angaben auf iranische Nuklearanlagen sowie Militärführer und Atomwissenschaftler ab. Das kündigte an, die Angriffe würden „so lange fortgesetzt, bis die Bedrohung durch das iranische Atomprogramm beseitigt ist“. Der Iran reagierte am Freitagabend mit Vergeltungsschlägen auf Tel Aviv und Jerusalem. Seitdem dauern die Kampfhandlungen an.\nMedienberichte über israelisch-amerikanische Koordination: Widersprüchliche Aussagen häufen sich\nDie USA haben wiederholt eine Beteiligung an Israels Erstschlag gegen den Iran dementiert. Eine Reihe von Berichten deutet jedoch darauf hin, dass sie möglicherweise eine größere Rolle gespielt haben, als offiziell zugegeben wurde. Ungenannte US-Beamte teilten mehreren Nachrichtenagenturen am Sonntag (15. Juni) mit, dass US-Präsident Donald Trump einen israelischen Plan zur Ermordung des obersten iranischen Führers Ayatollah Ali Chamenei abgelehnt habe. Israel hat einen solchen Plan dementiert, aber die gemeldete Ablehnung durch Trump deutet auf eine gewisse Abstimmung zwischen hin.\nZudem war das Vorgehen Israels seit Monaten in Vorbereitung. Berichte vom Mai über Israels Vorbereitungen für einen Angriff auf den Iran deuteten darauf hin, dass die Trump-Regierung Israel bei einer solchen Operation nicht unterstützen würde – zumal Washington gerade mitten in Verhandlungen über ein Atomabkommen mit Teheran stand. Das Nachrichtenportal Axios berichtete jedoch am Freitag, israelische Beamte hätten angegeben, dass die Angriffe seien tatsächlich mit den USA abgestimmt gewesen seien. Sie behaupteten zudem, die Trump-Regierung habe öffentlich vorgegeben, einen israelischen Angriff abzulehnen, Israel jedoch hinter verschlossenen Türen „grünes Licht“ gegeben.\nNetanjahu strebt militärische Lösung an: Trump setzt auf diplomatischen Kurs mit dem Iran\nMonatelang habe sich die Trump-Regierung den Bitten Netanjahus widersetzt, Israel grünes Licht für einen Angriff auf den Iran mit Unterstützung der USA zu geben, schreibt auch der britische Guardian. Trump habe jedoch auf eine Chance bestanden, mit den iranischen Führern ein Abkommen auszuhandeln. Ein Abkommen, das Teheran dazu zwingen würde, sein Atomprogramm aufzugeben, im Gegenzug für die Aufhebung der US- und anderer internationaler Sanktionen. Während Netanjahu derzeit also behaupte, er wolle den Iran lediglich daran hindern, Atomwaffen zu entwickeln, ziele der Angriff ebenso sehr darauf ab, die Verhandlungen zwischen Teheran und Washington zu sprengen.\nMit dem Angriff auf den Iran und der Torpedierung der Verhandlungen habe Netanjahu Trump übertrumpft, so das Blatt. Der israelische Regierungschef könne die USA so in einen neuen Nahostkonflikt verwickeln, den Trump nach eigenen Angaben nicht will. Seit Netanjahu nach dem Angriff der Hamas auf den Süden Israels im Oktober 2023 mehrere Kriege in der Region entfesselt habe, sei er zuversichtlich, dass die USA ihm immer aus der Patsche helfen werden. Selbst nach dem Krieg Israels gegen Gaza, einer zweimonatigen Bodeninvasion im Libanon und häufigen Angriffen auf Syrien erhalte Israel weiterhin praktisch unbegrenzte Waffenlieferungen und politische Unterstützung aus Washington – und werde deshalb immer risikobereiter.\nNetanjahu nimmt regionalen Machtumbau ins Visier: Trump will Abkommen statt Konfrontation\nDie unklaren Aussagen über das Ausmaß der Beteiligung der USA könnten jedoch auf unterschiedliche Prioritäten zwischen den USA und Israel hindeuten. Trita Parsi vom Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft erklärte gegenüber NPR, dass es „eindeutig eine Abstimmung und eine Art grünes Licht“ der Trump-Regierung für die israelischen Angriffe gegeben habe. „Trump geht hier ein großes Risiko ein, weil er glaubt, dass dies die iranische Position tatsächlich mildern und sie zur Kapitulation zwingen wird“, ist Parsi überzeugt. „Wenn sie das nicht tun, welche Optionen hat er dann noch? Und hier hoffen die Israelis meiner Meinung nach, dass die Iraner nicht kapitulieren und die Vereinigten Staaten damit in den Krieg gezwungen werden.“\nEs sei kaum überraschend, dass Israel gegenüber dem Iran in die Offensive gegangen sei, urteilt The Conversation. Die USA sähen ihren Einfluss in der Region schwinden und seien trotz jährlichen Waffenlieferungen im Wert von 3,8 Milliarden US-Dollar (3,2 Milliarden Euro) kaum mehr in der Lage, Einfluss auf Israel zu nehmen. Für Netanjahu sei dies eine einmalige Gelegenheit, den Nahen Osten neu zu gestalten und die regionalen Machtverhältnisse zu verschieben. Dabei scheine er sich wenig darum zu kümmern, was die USA oder der Rest der Welt von seinem Vorgehen halten. (tpn)",

    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Whether you’re aware or not, the person to your left or right could be a survivor or victim of human trafficking. It’s a disgusting reality, an often-invisible issue that’s happening right here in Jacksonville.\nRELATED: Revealing the myths of human trafficking: It happens where you live\nIt’s a sense of pride in American culture to be self-sufficient, but Silvia Almond, the President of the Jacksonville chapter of Save Our Adolescents from Prostitution (SOAP), said that it can be hindering when it comes to the topic of human trafficking.\n“The American culture is so self-sufficient I can protect myself. This is not going to happen to me. No way. It’s gonna happen in my neighborhood. It’s nothing happened in the school. It happened somewhere else,” Almond said.\nIt’s true this happens all over the world, but it’s also happening here in Jacksonville.\nFor over two decades, Almond has been an advocate to stop the invisible issue and for 17 years, she’s been doing everything she can to stop it here in Jacksonville.\n“But I started by myself, hands on, asking for nothing, saying let me see, How can I help,“ Almond said passionately, ”I’ve been blessed that I never have any of those issues, but my heart was always going to help people.”\nWhile she’s helped women overseas, in South Carolina and now Florida, she said this isn’t just in one area.\n“People don’t realize that those houses people live in, it’s happening in there,” Almond said.\nAlmond is going to Jacksonville-area hotels to raise awareness. She said what America thinks of as a “brothel” is only what we see on TV or in the movies, but in all actuality, the real brothels in America are the hotels.\n“The girls are all by themselves,” Almond said. “They have a lot of cash, a lot of money, they stand there in the lobby for, they don’t look like a prostitute, they look like normal girls.”\nShe leaves a package to a hotel manager explaining what the mission is, flyers of the current missing children in the Jacksonville area as well as flyers with human trafficking signs and prevention. They even have bars of soap and makeup remover wipes that can be given to housekeeping to put in rooms or in the lobby bathroom, with ways for victims to contact someone for help.\nRELATED: ‘We’re going to do it together’: New exhibit at JAX highlights local battle with human trafficking\nBut the second most popular place where this is happening is online through gaming and apps.\n“It’s not like the movies say. It’s not like the TV says, they’re going to snatch you. They’re gonna take you down. That’s a 0.1% of the snatching of them. They really have a grooming process,” Almond said.\nAlmond said groomers are even on social media. She said she teaches parents how to talk about human trafficking with their children.\n“They want somebody to listen to them. They want somebody to sit with them. They want affection from parents,” Almond said.\nIn April, Ohio passed a law that makes child grooming for sexual abuse a criminal offense. Almond is hoping something similar will be considered in Florida.\nThe law classifies grooming as a misdemeanor, with the potential for felony charges for repeat offenders or if the child is under 13 years old.\nIf you, or suspect someone you know, is involved in a threatening situation you can call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or text BE FREE to 233733\nCopyright 2025 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "\"Shoot me!!!\" In an instant the gunman is turning her way, though is gun is still trained on Danny, his body partially slumped over from when he had been struck in the stomach. \"If you want to shoot anyone shoot me please!!!\" Her voice is desperate and tears are falling freely down her face. \"Don't hurt my Husband, please!!! Just shoot me!!!\" From where he is still trying to get up Danny can see his Wife, her eyes filled with tears as she begs for the gunman to spare him, doing absolutely anything that she can to make sure that he makes it out alive. Even at the cost of her own life. \"I won't be mad I promise, please just shoot me!!!\" The change was swift and the act was instantaneous and as the gunshot echoed loudly through the night gripped air a primal scream ripped its way up Danny's throat as he watched the love of his life collapse onto the rain wet asphalt beneath her. He was gone, seemingly faster than an eye blink but Danny didn't care, all he could focus on was his fallen Wife, his form staggering forward as he struggled to move fast enough, his hands immediately pressing down on the bullet hole that had been made, the feeling of warm blood staining the underbelly of his hands making his heart twist and revolt against his chest. Danny was still kneeling by her side when the paramedics arrived, the memory of dialing 911 and pleading for help passing vaguely though his mind and as his Wife is wheeled away and placed in the back of the ambulance Danny is left standing alone, covered in his Wife's blood and the reality of what she had done slowly but surely beginning to hit him. The ride to the hospital is completely silent and as Joe finally parks the squad car Danny gets out without a word, the shock finally settling fully into his body and now he can't seem to register much. Numbly Danny makes his way across the hospital's parking lot and towards the main entrance his father and sister waiting for him just inside the entrance lobby. \"She's in surgery.\" The first words that Danny actually takes notice of and his head snaps up and he seems to see for the very first time. \"The doctor says that they got her in just in time.\" Danny instinctively winces when he clenches his jaw to tight, a wave of shock cutting through his jaw. \"Let's head inside son, we've got a while to wait.\" Danny hasn't moved in hours, his back is screaming profanities at him for remaining in the same position for so long and he is sure if he were able to the skin from his fingers would be rubbed off with how excessively he has been ringing them. \"Mr. Reagan?\" At the sound of his surname Danny is on his feet, his head snapping to his right, the sight of a nurse dressed in theater scrubs making her approach resulting in his heart lodging firmly within his throat. \"Mr. Reagan, the surgery went well and we were able to remove the bullet from your wife without any issue, she is being rolled into recovery now if you would like to see her.\" Unable to bring himself to say a word all Danny does is nod his head and in less than a heartbeat he is following the nurse out of the waiting area and down the hallway. Silently Danny sits beside his Wife's bed, his gaze fixed on his hands as several quiet tears drip off his lashes and hit the back of his hands. As much as he wants to say something Danny can't find the strength to speak and so he just sits, trying desperately not to completely lose composure as he waits for his wife to wake up. A sound, far less than even a whine of discomfort enters the air and Danny's eyes are snapping upward and to his Wife's excessively pale face. He leans forward just a bit, his expression quietly contorted into one of immense pain. \"Hey there beautiful.\" he finds himself almost whimpering out when Amelia's eyes finally manage to roll open, his left hand fingers gingerly brushing across her sweat dampened hairline. Danny attempts a smile but it ends up dying almost instantly as the weight of his pain presses ever so tightly upon the corners of his eyes. He leans forward and with trembling lips presses a small kiss into his Wife's forehead. A soft glow emits from the hospital rooms bedside lamp as I sit quietly in my bed, Danny seated in the chair next to me his right hand holding gently to my left. With his shoulders hunched over and a look of deeply set torment upon his face I can feel my stomach twist and lurch within me as my gaze silently observes his profile. I gently squeeze his hand and he looks over at me. Hurt and afraid, these are the two emotions that I can pick out instantly, and as I lightly squeeze my Danny's hand again his voice drifts into the air. Tone weak and terrified. \"Why did you do it?\" Danny knows why I did what I did, he heard me, he saw me, he knows why, but I know too that he is hoping for an answer other than the one I will give him. Again I squeeze Danny's hand, though this time I lean over and press a tiny kiss into his mouth. \"Because you're my Husband and I love you.\" The anguish written into my Husband's features darkens In color as the words I have just spoke hang within the air and as tears quiet and fresh proceed to fall down my Husband's face I gently place my right hand on the back of his neck, draw him and repeatedly kiss the side of his head as he weeps into the curve of my neck. With Amelia fast asleep in her hospital bed, her left hand still holding his right Danny uses his other to tightly pinch the corners of his eyes. He feels the need to break down but he doesn't want to wake up his Wife, she has already been through enough and he wants her to rest. His emotions however have other plans and though he does his best to stay quiet, deep, hollow cries erupt from deep within his chest and easily break passed the confinements of his teeth. He didn't want to wake her, that is the last thing he wanted to do yet the moment he feels himself being drawn gently inward he knows that he has failed. She is kissing his head and lovingly rubbing his side, her voice soothing as attempts to help ease his pain. This only makes him cry harder and as Danny Reagan once again finds himself weeping into the crook of his Wife's neck there is only one that seems to remain alive within his mind. Almost losing her will forever be a muscle memory. ~ end",
