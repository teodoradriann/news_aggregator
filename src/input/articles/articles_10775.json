    "title": "Critical program for HIV patients in northern Maine ends amid growing outbreak",
    "text": "Nearly 150 people with HIV in northern Maine are at risk of losing access to vital resources after a program that managed their cases unexpectedly ended this week. The Regional Medical Center at Lubec terminated the Northern Maine HIV Program, which serves patients in five northern Maine counties, on Monday after it was unable to find a new subcontractor. The program previously provided medical case management under a subcontract the center had with the Health Equity Alliance, known as HEAL, which closed this spring. With the program ending, around 140 low-income people could lose access to local HIV case management. Program employees coordinated with patients to find medical providers and help with other challenges they faced related to their HIV diagnoses, according to former case managers Samantha White and Alyssa Clayton. The program has been running for 23 years, White said. The decision to terminate the program is “really scary,” White said, especially since it coincides with a growing HIV outbreak in Penobscot County. Two new cases were detected in June, and 26 people have been diagnosed in the outbreak since it began in October 2023. The Regional Medical Center at Lubec decided to end the program on June 25, according to CEO Tom MacDonald. The medical center is in the process of notifying clients by phone and mail through Wednesday, MacDonald said. He said he wasn’t sure if the center would be able to reach everyone. Some of the clients served by the program may not have permanent addresses. Those clients may have to contact the center directly to be notified, MacDonald said. White and Clayton had just a few days to get in touch with their clients to connect them with alternative resources. White estimated that they successfully contacted about 20 to 25 of those clients before their positions were terminated on June 30. Some of these clients were referred to case management services in the Augusta and Portland areas, which may offer telehealth services, but there are no other programs in northern Maine that offer HIV case management. White and Clayton worry about what it will mean for clients to lose the dedicated personal contact whose job it was to help them navigate a complex health care system. The two case managers helped their clients make medical appointments, solve issues with pharmacies, navigate paperwork, and secure food and rent assistance through funding programs for people with HIV, they said. Homeless clients could also use the office’s address to receive mail related to those programs. White and Clayton emphasized the urgency of connecting clients with HIV resources, especially as the outbreak in Penobscot County continues. Clayton said that around four of her clients were diagnosed as part of the outbreak. The two case managers had been part of the program since before HEAL closed. When the nonprofit shuttered in March, the case management services were transferred to the Regional Medical Center at Lubec. At that point, just White and Clayton were brought on to continue the case management work, according to White. Previously, HEAL typically employed around four or five case managers to help clients with HIV. The transfer to the center was meant to be a temporary fix to give the center time to find a new subcontractor, MacDonald said. None of the organizations the center reached out to were willing to take on the program, since they don’t provide case management services, MacDonald said. When the organization was unable to find a new subcontractor to replace HEAL, its leaders decided to end the program. Case management is “outside the scope” of what the medical center provides, MacDonald said. “Being unable to provide that, we would be outside of the requirements of the grant” funded by the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS program.

    "title": "Common man's voice must reach, and be heard by courts: Justice Arun Palli - The Tribune",
    "text": "Common man's voice must reach, and be heard by courts: Justice Arun Palli\n“The voice of the common man must reach, and be heard by the courts,” said Chief Justice Arun Palli, as he was sworn in as the Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Wednesday. He was administered the oath of office by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha.\nSetting the tone for a tenure anchored in accessibility, empathy and institutional reform, Justice Palli said it is imperative to accord equal space and attention to those who lacked the means or the legal vocabulary to press their case, in a system where seasoned litigants often came equipped with legal counsel and resources.\n“It is essential to ensure that justice does not merely respond to the loudest voices, but to the most unheard,” Justice Palli said, affirming that the judiciary must reflect the constitutional commitment to equality in both letter and spirit.\nAs Chief Justice Palli spoke, it became apparent that access to justice for him is not a technical provision but a lived principle — one that requires active and continuous effort. He asserted that the institution must create conditions where even the humblest citizen walks into a courtroom with the faith that their concerns will receive a fair hearing. “Justice must be a right for all, not a privilege for a few,” he observed.\nAn equally strong focus of his vision is the grooming of young advocates. The Chief Justice expressed deep conviction that the future of the institution rests on the shoulders of the next generation of lawyers. “Young advocates are the future of the judiciary. They need to be mentored, guided and given space to grow — so that when time comes, they are prepared to carry forward the values and responsibilities of the profession,” he said.\nHe added that professional growth must be balanced with the development of ethical strength and a deep understanding of justice as a service to society. He also placed considerable emphasis on strengthening the subordinate judiciary, which he refers to as the backbone of the judicial structure.\nTimely justice, particularly at the trial court level, Justice Palli said, is essential for sustaining public confidence.\n“Delays at the grassroots level have consequences far beyond the courtroom. They affect lives, livelihoods, and most importantly, trust in the system,” he said.\nHe spoke with equal concern for vulnerable categories of litigants — including retired employees and widows — who often face an uphill task in securing relief in service and pension matters. “These are matters that directly impact the lives of people who are already at a stage where waiting becomes a burden. Their grievances must be resolved without delay,” he said, making it clear that compassionate efficiency will form the bedrock of his approach.\nJustice Palli also referred to the need to revitalise the Legal Services Authority, calling it an essential tool for advancing the judiciary’s outreach mission.\nHe said that the institution’s success depended on the ability to extend legal aid to those who are otherwise left out of the formal justice system. “Legal aid is a constitutional right. Strengthening this mechanism is fundamental to ensuring that justice reaches every doorstep,” he said.\nInfusion of technology into the functioning of the courts is also among his key priorities. He maintains that digital systems must be adopted not as a matter of convenience, but as a serious step toward systemic reform. “Optimum use of technology can help us tackle many longstanding challenges — from pendency to transparency. It must become part of the institution’s core functioning,” he asserted.\nHe also offered a roadmap rooted in constitutional vision, institutional discipline, and a forward-looking judicial temperament. \"The success of the justice delivery system stems not just from its decisions, but from its openness, its ability to listen, and its resolve to impart justice where it is needed most,\" Justice Palli concluded.",

    "title": "Nova atualização da saúde de Papa Francisco: comunicado do Vaticano aponta mudança relevante no quadro médico e pedido do pontíficie",
    "text": "Nesta segunda-feira (17), o Vaticano confirmou uma mudança relevante no quadro de saúde do Papa Francisco. Após quatro dias de internação no Hospital Gemelli, em Roma, devido a uma infecção polimicrobiana das vias respiratórias, o pontífice apresentou melhora e já não tem febre. O tratamento continua sendo acompanhado de perto pelos médicos do hospital, e o Papa Francisco, que recebeu uma previsão astrológica surpreendente, segue estável. Pela manhã, ele recebeu a eucaristia e chegou a realizar atividades de trabalho de seu leito hospitalar.\nDesde a sexta-feira (14), quando foi hospitalizado, Papa Francisco vem recebendo um tratamento intensivo para combater a infecção. O quadro exigiu ajustes na medicação e uma supervisão médica rigorosa. Apesar das preocupações iniciais, Francisco, apresentou sinais significativos de melhora ao longo do fim de semana, o que levou os especialistas a considerarem sua evolução como estável e promissora.\nApesar da melhora, o papa fez um pedido aos fiéis: \"Rezem por mim\". O comunicado oficial destacou que ele está comovido com as \"numerosas mensagens de afeto\" que recebeu e agradeceu especialmente os pacientes do hospital que lhe enviaram desenhos e mensagens de pronta recuperação e cartões com votos de melhora.\nCom 88 anos, Papa Francisco, que tem fotos de IA com Rainha do Pop, enfrenta diversos desafios de saúde. Além da infecção atual, o pontífice convive com dores crônicas no joelho, que o obrigam a usar bengala ou cadeira de rodas em algumas ocasiões. Nos últimos meses, também sofreu quedas em sua residência no Vaticano, o que gerou preocupação entre os membros da Igreja. Em dezembro, bateu o queixo em uma mesa de cabeceira, e em janeiro, machucou o braço direito, necessitando de imobilização temporária.\nA equipe médica segue monitorando sua recuperação de perto, e ainda não há uma previsão exata de alta. O Vaticano assegura que Papa Francisco permanecerá hospitalizado pelo tempo necessário para garantir uma recuperação completa. Enquanto isso, os fiéis ao redor do mundo continuam em oração, esperançosos por sua plena recuperação e retorno às atividades religiosas.",
