    "text": "7. As, the\nmedia, their Democrats, and desperate Republicans celebrated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis leaving the presidential race, some suggested ignorantly that it was the House of Mouse that did him in. Obviously, that was not true, and now DeSantis has beaten back a lawsuit alleging “retaliation” is the latest win over the media conglomerate.\n6. CNN’s Poppy Harlow tried to get NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to slam former President Donald Trump but the Stoltenberg was\nuninterested in playing this game and praised him instead. Noting that Trump’s gripe about NATO was all about how our allies were not paying their fair share and they pay more now, “worked with him for four years and I listened carefully because the main criticism has been about NATO allies spending too little on NATO and the message has been taken across the alliance in Europe and Canada.”\n5. Who wouldn’t want to let murderous Hamas killers into the United States after their decades of slaughter, and specifically the attacks on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7? Well, after a\n422-2 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, two members actually voted against a bill banning these monsters and unsurprisingly they were members of “The Squad” – U.S. Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\n4. A big\nhttps://www.al.com/news/2024/01/freedom-from-religion-foundation-takes-credit-for-removing-bible-verse-on-alabama-schools-dugout.html for the terrible people at the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) as Mobile County Schools’ Theodore High School removed a “divisive” Bible verse (I Corinthians 10:31) that reads, “Whatever you do, do it for the Glory of GOD”. The idea that the FFRF is protecting children by doing this stuff is silly, they are attention seekers who send out e-mails from the office in Wisconsin, seeking attention, and hoping people will bend to their will, it is best to ignore them officially.\n3. A White House employee, Charlie Kraiger, a cybersecurity policy analyst and Foreign Affairs desk officer in the Executive Office at the White House, told conservative guerrilla journalist James O’Keefe that the Biden Administration is in\nchaos. The Biden Administration’s Kraiger told O’Keefe, whom he thought he was on a date with, that President Joe Biden is in clear mental decline, everyone hates Vice President Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama is not running, and that many people “think they need to get rid of [Biden] or [Harris].”\n2. The Business Council of Alabama (BCA) is making it pretty clear that they are ready to fully\nbattle the United Auto Workers union (UAW) to keep them out of the Mercedes plant to make sure “that we will not let the UAW do to Alabama what it did to Detroit.” While unions keep trying to gain a foothold deeper into the state of Alabama, there could be another unionization vote at the Amazon facility in Bessemer too. The BCA says the union is a threat to Alabama’s jobs and they could point to the latest UPS layoffs after their union secured big pay increases.\n1. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, backed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, is being\ncited as the group responsible for the attack on American soldiers in Jordan last week by the Biden Administration as it weighs a response that is sure to come soon. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says he believes Iran planned, resourced, and facilitated the attack while Iran said it will “decisively respond” to any attack on Iran, where a direct attack seems unlikely.\nListen here:\nDale Jackson is a thought leader for Yellowhammer News and hosts a talk show from 5-9 a.m. weekdays on WVNN, on Talk 99.5 from 10-11 a.m., and on Talk Radio 103.9 FM/730AM WUMP from noon to 1 p.m.\nDon’t miss out!\nSubscribe today to have Alabama’s leading headlines delivered to your inbox.",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Abbeville County, South Carolina from 1901-2000 was 43.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Abbeville County, South Carolina experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Abbeville County, South Carolina history.",
