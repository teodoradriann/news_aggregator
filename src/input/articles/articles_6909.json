    "text": "This past August, a Georgetown University Law Center graduate and his brother launched To Go Green, an eco-friendly takeout service that aims to revolutionize the restaurant industry by introducing reusable containers that customers can return to restaurant partners after their meal.\nKevin Kay (LAW ’20) and Harrison Kay’s company partnered with 13 restaurants to encourage the Washington, D.C. community to build a closed-loop consumption cycle and help restaurants reduce costs associated with single-use plastics. To Go Green came to fruition after the company received a grant from the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment , the D.C. mayor’s office and the Chesapeake Bay Trust, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the watershed of the Chesapeake Bay.\nKevin Kay said inspiration struck during the pandemic when the brothers — who are vegan — became increasingly frustrated by the amount of single-use waste their takeout orders were creating.\n“During the pandemic, many D.C. restaurants were closed for dining, and Harison and I were ordering a lot of takeout. But we’re vegan so we try to be conscious about our environmental impact, and we became very frustrated with how much single-use waste our takeout orders were creating,” Kevin Kay told The Hoya. “So we’re starting to brainstorm a solution to that problem, which is a problem that we discovered many other D.C residents were facing.”\nGeorgetown Law graduate Kevin Kay (LAW ’20) and his brother Harrison Kay launched To Go Green this summer, an eco-friendly takeout service. (Courtesy of Kevin and Harrison Kay) Leah Karrer, executive director of the Waste & Resources Action Programme, a global environmental action nongovernmental organization and one of To Go Green’s customers, said To Go Green is a unique solution to waste problems.\n“Using To Go Green is easy and incredibly straightforward,” Karrer told The Hoya. “What I love about it is that they’re very innovative. They’re a local, real-world solution to what is a massive, global problem of overproduction, unsustainable consumption and extensive waste.”\nTo place a takeout order, customers visit To Go Green’s website and select a meal from a partner restaurant. The food is packaged in reusable containers that can withstand up to 1,000 uses. Customers have three weeks to return the container, either by scheduling a pickup or dropping it off at the restaurant.\nKevin Kay said To Go Green uses Uber Direct, a local delivery platform for businesses, to connect customers with restaurants, but it hopes to involve other delivery companies such as DoorDash or GrubHub in the future.\n“We have not integrated their containers into the larger online ordering platforms like Doordash or Grubhub, although that is certainly a goal for us in the future in order to offer our reusable containers to a broader audience,” Kevin Kay told The Hoya.\nTo Go Green earns a profit by charging a commission on each order and charging restaurants on a per-use basis for containers. Their containers, manufactured by G.E.T. Enterprises — the same company that manufactures containers at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall at Georgetown University — are durable, microwave-safe and BPA-free.\nLela Singh, retail manager of Teaism , one of To Go Green’s restaurant partners, said Teaism had been considering the switch to reusable containers for many years, but did not believe it was something they had the bandwidth to do until To Go Green facilitated the operations.\n“I love that they could solve an issue for us,” Singh told The Hoya. “We can’t manage the inventory of reusable containers, but through their app, they can. It is a huge admin burden off a small business. And also, the To Go Green container price for us is actually less than a lot of the disposable containers we use.”\nKevin Kay said “Business and Financial Basics for Lawyers,” a business course at Georgetown Law, inspired him to consider entrepreneurship as a career, instead of criminal law, which he studied originally.\n“It’s funny how things work out because when I was a 3L in law school I took a class called ‘Business Basics for Lawyers’ to have an easier semester,” Kevin Kay told The Hoya. “I should have been paying a lot more attention in that class.”\n“Even though I focused on criminal law, just having a law degree from Georgetown has been helpful because legal skills can be useful for things like creating partnership agreements,” Kevin Kay added.\nKarrer said it is essential that businesses can profit from sustainable efforts to guarantee environmental conservation.\n“In order for us to have a sustainable planet, we need businesses to be making money off sustainable practices,” Karrer said. “And that’s what I envision for To Go Green, that it will be a self-sustaining business.”",

    "text": "Waterloo community members gathered to send off 33 Iowa National Guard soldiers early Friday, the latest contingent set to serve in a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo that now has lasted 20 years. The soldiers from Waterloo-based Detachment 1, Company C (Medevac) of the 2-211th General Support Aviation Battalion departed from the Waterloo Airport Army Aviation Facility. They will begin on a nine-month stay in the small southeastern European nation after completing pre-mobilization training in Fort Cavasos, Texas, the National Guard said in a news release.\n“We're just really proud of our service members and very proud of our sister state partnership program , and what we can do to not only assist and benefit the country of Kosovo, but also our service members in that training and mission process,” said Jackie Schmillen, public affairs director for the Iowa National Guard.\nMore: Growing Kosovo: Iowa helps build a nation from the ashes of war\nThe peacekeeping mission under NATO auspices began after a brutal war with Serbia in 1998 and 1999 that led to Kosovo's independence. The Iowa National Guard deployments there began in 2003, and in 2011, Iowa and the Kosovo Security Force joined the State Partnership Program. Developed during the Cold War, the program established diplomatic ties between National Guard units and foreign militaries.\nMore: Iowa National Guard plans weekend training center in West Des Moines\nThe soldiers’ primary mission after deployment will be to conduct live aerial medical evacuation operations, refueling and maintenance support for U.S., coalition and Kosovo security forces.\nKosovo Security Force soldiers have visited Camp Dodge in Johnston, headquarters of the Iowa National Guard, and Kosovo maintains a consulate in Des Moines.

    "text": "Washington, D.C., continues to grapple with worsening air quality, earning an “F” in the 2025 State of the Air Report. Despite local efforts to reduce pollution, health experts warn that air quality remains a significant concern, especially for vulnerable communities. (Photo Credit: Unsplash / DDP)\nBy Tashi McQueen\nAFRO Staff Writer\ntmcqueen@afro.com\nWashington, D.C.’s air quality was given a failing grade in The 2025 State of the Air Report by the American Lung Association (ALA).\nThe recently released report found that between 2021 and 2023, D.C. experienced a drop in air quality. Due to increases in particle pollution, the region averaged 3.7 unhealthy days per year, dropping them from a “C” in the 2024 report to an “F” this year.\n“The air pollutants highlighted in this report are widespread and pose a risk to everyone’s health,” said Aleks Casper, advocacy director of the Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and DC · American Lung Association, in a statement on April 23. “Both ozone and particle pollution can lead to premature death and cause serious health issues such as asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm births and even problems with cognitive function later in life.”\nAccording to the report, from 2021 to 2023, 37 percent of the population – 125.2 million individuals – was exposed to unhealthy ozone levels, a reactive gas that can damage a person’s lungs when inhaled.\nSince 2000, the ALA has released its State of the Air Report, which aims to inform the public about the air quality in their cities and states, locate at-risk populations and recommend actions local leaders and legislators can take to improve air quality.\nAccording to a 2021 report by Advancing Earth and Space Sciences, a global community of earth and space sciences professionals, the top 10 D.C. neighborhoods impacted by air pollution have a 54 percent higher proportion of Black residents and a 44 percent lower proportion of White residents.\n“The District of Columbia takes air pollution seriously and has done a lot over the past decade to reduce air pollution, [ including ] limiting pollution on boilers, tackling nuisance odors, adopting strict vehicle standards and funding projects to reduce pollution from trains and buses,” said Nicole Goines, a public information officer of the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment.\nGoines claimed that the ALA report is misleading, as it relies in part on data from the District during the “once-in-a-decade” wildfires in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Nova Scotia that occurred in 2023.\n“Even if the District produced no pollution, our air quality during the wildfires in June 2023 would still have been hazardous,” she said.\n“In more typical summers, modeling shows that 90 percent of our pollution comes from outside of the District borders,” she added. “We will not be able to achieve these goals alone and must have strong international, federal and regional partners to limit harmful air pollution.”\nThe post D.C. gets ‘F’ for air quality in 2025 State of the Air Report appeared first on AFRO American Newspapers .",

Warrior Met Coal's Ballooning Development Costs Prompt Analysts To Rethink Projections HCC +0.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio Add to Watchlist Add Position Position added successfully to:\nPlease name your holdings portfolio Type: BUY SELL Date: Amount: Price Point Value: Leverage: 1:1 1:10 1:25 1:50 1:100 1:200 1:400 1:500 1:1000 Commission: Create New Watchlist Create Create a new holdings portfolio Add Create + Add another position Close Benzinga - by Matt Whittaker, .\nRBC Capital analysts this week lowered their price target for Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC) as costs balloon at the steelmaking coal company's Blue Creek mine project.\nThe analysts dropped their price target from $74 to $64 after the company said it plans to spend $335 million to $390 million this year on developing the mine and other discretionary expenditures. That figure was 32% higher than the RBC analysts had expected and 24% above consensus expectations.\nFor the fourth quarter, the analysts were expecting the company to spend $152 million in capex, mostly on the mine expansion, while a consensus estimated $149 million. The actual price tag for capex and mine development the company reported last week was $182.5 million.\nThe company said free cash flow declined by $34 million in the fourth quarter compared to the comparable period in 2022 primarily because of capital expenditures at Blue Creek, which is located in Alabama.\nScheduled to begin commercial operations in 2026, Blue Creek has a reserve base of 69.8 million short tons of recoverable reserves and 49.5 million short tons of coal resources, making it one of the largest untouched metallurgical coal reserves in North America, the company says.\nWarrior Met Coal originally thought the project would cost $700 million. Additional scope for transportation and logistics added $120 to $130 million to the price tag, and inflation of 25% to 35% pushed that estimate to around $1 billion.\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Enters Uranium Derivatives Market As Prices Double To $102 Per Pound\n\"Inflationary cost in the mining sector continues to persist and pressure cost structures for labor, supplies, materials and equipment purchases,\" Warrior Chief Financial Officer Dale Boyles said in a company conference call discussing its most recent financial results. \"These additional costs are expected to drive up our cost per short ton in 2024.\"\nOne of the factors influencing the company's capex expectations for 2024 is that it will need to hire 250 new employees to fill gaps at existing mines and to ramp up Blue Creek later in the year, Boyles said.\n\"It's easy to read the Wall Street Journal and say, well, it's come down to 3.4%,\" Boyles said, referring to a recent print for general U.S. inflation. \"Well, that has nothing to do with the mining sector where there's been a tremendous increase in labor and supplies and materials. We've talked about it over the last three years, just quarter-after-quarter of the inflation in this sector. So don't see that changing.\"\nBeyond the Blue Creek mine expenses, Warrior Met Coal said it is also facing higher freight costs because of low water levels in the Panama Canal system and geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea.\nDespite its lowered price target, the RBC analysts this week maintained their Sector Perform rating on Warrior Met Coal.\n\"While 2024 capex at Blue Creek was above our estimates, management reiterated the total capex provided in Q2/2023 of ~$1.04B,\" the analysts said. \"We think Warrior remains well positioned to continue generating strong FCF as met coal prices remain elevated ($315/t spot) while balancing Blue Creek growth with shareholder returns.\"\nIn spite of the higher spending, Warrior Met Coal's fourth quarter net income rose.

    "text": "NEW YORK -- A man narrowly avoided getting hit by a subway train, thanks to New Yorkers who helped him onto the platform.\nCBS New York heard from a woman who helped save him, and is pushing for more mental health resources citywide.\nIt could've ended much differently for the man, who may have been suffering a mental episode. He later identified himself to commuter Marie Delus as \"Deuce.\"\n\"Everybody just came together as a community to help him. So it was a beautiful feeling, but I also was like in the moment like, 'Is he gonna be okay?'\" Delus said.\nDelus had just left work and was walking down to catch her train at the Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall station on Wednesday just after 6 p.m. when she heard screaming.\n\"People stopped the train and I think that was what the screaming was when I went downstairs,\" Delus said.\nThe man was already on the tracks by the time Delus got to the platform, so it's unclear what exactly led up to the rescue. But she said he didn't appear to have been pushed.\n\"I didn't know how he got on the track. It was all the people there who said he jumped,\" Delus said.\nShe stayed by him as first responders arrived. A confused Deuce later gained awareness.\nVideo shot by Delus shows their interactions.\n\"I was on that track?\" Deuce said.\n\"In the middle of the track, yes sir. Right in the middle,\" Delus said.\n\"On the train track?\" Deuce said.\n\"On the train track, yes sir,\" Delus responded.\n\"Train track?!?\" Deuce asked.\n\"Yes sir, yup,\" Delus said.\nDelus said she feels he represents countless other New Yorkers who need help. She said taking the video was second nature to her as a way to send an important message to city officials on mental health.\n\"We need to do more. What does that look like? What does that mean? Why was Deuce on the track? And what happens to him after that? Once he leaves and they take him away, are they gonna release him again? Will Deuce be back on the track again?\" Delus said.\nDelus said had to run to an important Brooklyn Community Board 18 meeting and couldn't stay with him much longer, but wants to know more.\n\"I would love to find out who Deuce is, is he okay, what happened when he left, and if there's anything I can do to help him,\" Delus said.\nOne of his shoes is still on the track. It was a minor loss compared to the alternative.\nMore from CBS News Man arrested for attacking kids selling candy in Manhattan subway station Family of man killed in subway push incident faces suspect in NYC court Man accused in Rockland stabbing suffers from mental illness, lawyer says Caught on video: Man rescued from NYC's Hudson River Montefiore's community health workers help people navigate complex social needs In: Brooklyn Subway Mental Health",

    "text": "Vikings DC Brian Flores still gets a pit in his stomach when thinking about Khyree Jackson Vikings DC Brian Flores still gets a pit in his stomach when thinking about Khyree Jackson EAGAN, Minn. — As the Minnesota Vikings progress through training camp and into the regular season, in those idle moments between tasks and events when a random reminder of Khryee Jackson might pop up, thoughts for those who spent the most time with the rookie cornerback will quickly become heavy. Defensive coordinator Brian Flores watched every snap that Jackson played last season with Oregon and met with him several times from the Senior Bowl to the NFL draft and on through the spring practices. “I was really excited about coaching him and getting him here. I think he had a bright future,” Flores said. “It’s still something that gives me a pit in my stomach. It’s still something that I’m dealing with internally — like this entire organization is, like I know his family and friends are — but I hope they can take a little comfort in knowing that he certainly impacted a lot of people in a very positive way.” Flores will join general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, head coach Kevin O'Connell and defensive backs coach Daronte Jones in a contingent from Minnesota that will attend Jackson's funeral in Maryland on Friday. The service for him and former high school teammate Isaiah Hazel will take place three weeks after the car crash that killed them and a third friend, A.J. Lytton. “We’re starting training camp and everyone’s excited about that, but I think that situation puts a lot of things in perspective and definitely makes you realize there are a lot of things that are much bigger than football,” Flores said on Thursday before the team's second practice of camp. Jackson was taken with the 108th overall pick in the fourth round, boasting skills in press coverage and run stopping that were bound to fit well in Flores' aggressive and creative scheme. After winning two state championships as a wide receiver with Wise High School in Upper Marlboro, Jackson’s academic standing forced him down an alternative path. He initially attended Arizona Western Community College, but he came back to Maryland after a couple of weeks and was so embarrassed by his dropout he laid low at home \"for about six months.\" He got a job in the deli department at a Harris Teeter supermarket, slicing ham for a living and even winning an employee of the month award. He got so good at video games he seriously considered trying to make the NBA 2K esports league and was training for a tournament when he got a call from Fort Scott Community College about getting back into football. He played there in 2019 after two full seasons off, switched to cornerback and suddenly was back on a major college track. After enrolling at East Mississippi Community College and navigating the pandemic shutdowns, Jackson landed at Alabama. His first start came in the national championship game after the 2021 season, and one year later he transferred to Oregon to finish his college career. “I have my moments where I get down. When you think about all that he had been through to get to this point, that’s a lot of what I loved about the player,\" Flores said, later adding: “He certainly had some things in his life that I thought were going to propel him to doing some great things.\" While there's no parallel that exists between death and injury, the Vikings are hurting at cornerback after the torn ACL that Mekhi Blackmon suffered in practice on Wednesday. “This is a player who’s absolutely crushed. Obviously it’s been unfortunate with the Khyree Jackson situation at that position and for our team,” O'Connell said. “For a young player, he really established himself as a guy we were going to be counting on.” The Vikings placed Blackmon on season-ending injured reserve on Thursday and signed cornerback Jacobi Francis to start the process of trying to enhance their depth. Francis entered the league with Houston in 2022 as an undrafted free agent out of Memphis. He was released by the Texans last year. Blackmon, a third-round pick in the 2023 draft out of USC, played his way into the nickel package last season that allowed Byron Murphy Jr. to move from the outside to the slot. The Vikings are planning to pair Murphy with another veteran in newcomer Shaq Griffin in the two primary cornerback spots, but they will need a lot more production from players such as Akayleb Evans and Andrew Booth Jr. to keep their pass coverage from slipping as it did last season. “I thought we were going to see a different version of Mekhi, a better version of Mekhi,” Flores said. “Quite honestly I think we’ll see that moving forward, and that’s what I told him yesterday. I think 10 years from now this will just be a bump in the road.” /hub/NFL This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.
