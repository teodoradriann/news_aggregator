    "title": "Hajj: The blessed journey (II)",
    "text": "All praise belongs to Allah (SWT) alone. Peace and blessings of Allah be upon the seal of Prophets, Muhammad bin Abdullahi, his family, and companions.\nAllah (SWT) says to His servants who receive salvation and success in this world and the hereafter; “They exhort one another to truth, and exhort one another to patience.” Allah (SWT) further says: “And help one another in goodness and fear of Allah, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.” We ask Allah (SWT) to accept from all of us our striving, and our good deeds towards the course of authentic worship, Al-Islam, including hajj.\nIt is advised that one who intends to embark on pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah (SWT) should acquaint himself or herself with the dos and don’ts. It is of great importance that Muslim pilgrims take to the list of advice offered here, to start with. Pilgrims should remember that they are on a blessed journey, a journey based on Tawheed (Islamic monotheism), faithfulness to Allah (SWT), responding to His call, and in obedience to His commands, hoping the reward of the Almighty.\nThe pilgrims should also be prepared to take to the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) in all they do on hajj. They should not forget that the reward for a hajj pilgrimage which is acceptable to Allah (SWT) is Jannah (paradise).\nPilgrims must guard against the evils of the accursed Satan who intends to cause dissention among the pilgrims. Satan is an enemy lying in ambush for every spirited Muslim, much more the pilgrims on hajj. Pilgrims should love one another as brothers and sisters. They should avoid disputes and any intransigence which may lead to disobeying the dictates of Allah (SWT). The Prophet (SAW) endeared us to understand that “none of you has truly believed unless he likes for his brother what he likes for himself.”\nPilgrims should not hesitate to find out on issues that may border on Islam, particularly the rites of hajj, by asking questions. They should not shy away from approaching fellow Muslims who are knowledgeable enough to explain these issues with them. This is because Allah (SWT) instructs, “Ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know.” Rossullullahi (SAW) said, “When Allah intends good for someone, He gives him understanding of the religion.” One specific reason for the pilgrims to imbibe this attitude is that Allah (SWT) has made certain acts of worship fard (duty, obligation), whereas others are essentially Sunnah.\nIt is very important for the pilgrims to know that Allah (SWT) does not accept the Sunnah from a Muslim who ignores and violates the fard. During the hajj rites, some pilgrims are found wanting. They cause harm to others, men and women, by being overzealous in their attempt to kiss the Black Stone, or in circumambulating the Ka’aba, or in their bid to observe solat behind the Station of Prophet Ibraheem (A.S.), or to drink from Zamzam and any other similar hajj rites. All of these are hajj rituals which are not fard. They are sunnah. Harming or inflicting injuries on fellow pilgrims is prohibited. Therefore, pilgrims must avoid hurting one another. May Allah (SWT) grant all the pilgrims immense reward for their perseverance and patience.\nTo guarantee safety and ensure a hitch-free hajj exercise, the pilgrims must be schooled on certain misconceived practices during hajj. It is wrong for a male Muslim to perform his solat close to or right behind a female Muslim in the Sacred Mosque, or in other places for whatever reason. It is female Muslims that are expected to pray behind the male Muslims. It is not proper to observe solat on the pathways leading into the Haram, or in the doorways, because doing so is harmful and obstructive to other pilgrims coming into the Sacred Mosque.\nIt is equally not permissible for the pilgrims to block free flow of other pilgrims who are on tawaf around (circumambulating) Ka’aba by standing near the Black Stone or at the Station of Ibraheem when the site is crowded. This is a potential cause of harm to other pilgrims. It is sufficient to point at the Black Stone, saying “Allahu Akbar.” And when leaving the tawaf area, pilgrims should endeavour to leave gently. Safeguarding the dignity of fellow Muslims is fard (obligatory), and kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah (supererogatory). A fard should not be sacrificed for a sunnah.\nIn case a pilgrim undertaking the tawaf is prevented by circumstances, he or she should continue with his tawaf. He should not point at the Ruknul Yamani or utter the takbir (Allahu Akbar), because that has not been reported from the Prophet (SAW). It is mustahab (recommended) to recite the following supplication between the corner of the Ruknul Yamani and the Black Stone: “Rabbana atina fid dunya hasanatan wa fil akhirati hassanatan wa qina adhaban nar” (our Lord, give us good in this world, and good in the hereafter and save us from the torment of the Hellfire).\nPilgrims should always follow the dictates of Allah (SWT) in the Qur’an and the Sunnah of His Messenger (SAW) in all they engage themselves in in Saudi Arabia during the\nhajj rites.\nRead Also:\nTinubu assures intelligence community of conducive working environment",

[The Great Backyard Bird Count](https://www.birdcount.org/) returns for the 27th year, beginning Feb.16 through Feb.19. The global event gives people the opportunity to observe birds and submit their findings to a database. “A lot of people just don't realize how interesting and neat birds are,” said Becca Rodomsky-Bish, project leader for the great backyard bird count. “They don't realize sometimes the diversity of birds that may be around them and so this is an opportunity to sort of have that spark moment where you realize, ‘Wow, that there are birds and their species that I never even knew existed out there.’” People are asked to watch birds for at least 15 minutes, count and identify the type, then submit their observations to [eBird.](https://ebird.org/home) Related: [7,000+ trees on chopping block for trail expansion in Sleeping Bear Dunes](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/7000-trees-chopping-block-trail-expansion-sleeping-bear-dunes) [Unseasonably warm weather in Michigan a challenge for fruit farmers](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/unseasonably-warm-weather-michigan-challenge-fruit-farmers) [Reimagined St. Ignace memorial to be a showcase of Native American history](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/reimagined-st-ignace-memorial-be-showcase-native-american-history) Observers can use [Merlin](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/?utm_source=adgrant&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=merlin&utm_content=merlinbirdguide&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAw6yuBhDrARIsACf94RUlN2--EUv3h_f1vH2_3dSpvAHVZQLPO13sc542IeLSf_zQQY5QOT4aAnzwEALw_wcB) from The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a tool that makes it easier to identify bird species by either sound, photo or by answering three simple questions. This type of data from around the world allows a view into bird movements, including new locations for different species, which can paint a picture of a changing environment, Rodomsky-Bish said. Researchers are using the data to answer broader questions related to climate change, for example. Rodomsky-Bish said it is very likely the data from the event will show that changing weather patterns have influenced when and where birds migrate. Rodomsky-Bish said she is looking forward to data that shows birds may be moving earlier and farther north than in previous years due to the warm weather this winter. The Department of Natural Resources encourages safe practices for attracting birds. “One of the things that we recommend is to make sure they keep their feeders clean and do it before you start to see sick birds,” said Julie Melotti of the DNR Wildlife Disease Lab. “Keep areas around bird feeders tidy and clean. If food gets scattered on the ground just pick it up,” she said. Diseases like Salmonellosis and various strains of bird influenza are easily transmitted through bird feeders, Melotti said. Highly pathogenic diseases can be spread to other birds like turkeys and chickens. “Birds are really important to protect because they provide a lot of ecosystem services and a lot of cultural services to people,” she said. “In addition to all that they give to agricultural and to natural environments, they’re also obviously something that people really enjoy looking at and being around.” Michigan Environment Watch Michigan Environment Watch examines how public policy, industry, and other factors interact with the state’s trove of natural resources.

    "text": "BEIRUT — After the double assassination last month of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a high-ranking Hezbollah commander in Beirut, Iran and Hezbollah vowed retaliation against Israel, saying that vengeance was a \"matter of honor.\"\nMany braced for a response from Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah that might trigger an all-out regional war.\nBut that hasn't happened.\nAlmost a month after the killings, the \"harsh punishment\" promised by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, along with the \"strong and effective\" reprisal Hezbollah head Sayed Hassan Nasrallah vowed to bring upon Israel, has yet to materialize.\nAnd this week, Iranian officials hinted a response is not imminent.\n\"Time is at our disposal and the waiting period for this answer may be a long one,\" said Brig. Gen. Ali Mohammad Naeini, spokesman for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in a press conference Tuesday. He insisted there was nevertheless \"a serious determination to respond to the various aggressions of the Zionist regime,\" a reference to Israel, and that it may not be a \"repeat of previous operations.\"\nHe appeared to be referring to Iran's missile barrage against Israel in April, which came after Israel killed a top Iranian commander in the country's embassy in the Syrian capital, Damascus.\nMany airlines have canceled flights into Israel for fear of being caught in the crossfire. Foreign embassies have issued travel and security warnings for Israel, hitting Tel Aviv's summer tourist season hard.\nThe number of travelers to Israel is down 75% in the first six months of the year, according to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics.\nLast week, Fitch downgraded Israel's credit rating from \"A+\" to \"A\" in the face of continued conflict in Gaza that \"could last well into 2025\" and the \"risks of it broadening to other fronts,\" according to a note from the U.S. credit rating agency.\nIran and Lebanon have experienced similar airline suspensions. For Lebanon, where Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the border since Oct. 8, the losses in tourism revenues are estimated to be more than $7 billion, officials say, compounding the malaise of an economy already suffering through a devastating five-year currency crisis.\nIn the three weeks since the killings, the U.S. deployed additional forces to the Middle East, dispatching two carrier groups — the second, led by the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, arrived Wednesday — and a submarine, to serve as a deterrent as well as a means of defense in the event of an attack against Israel.\nConcerns are growing that the conflict could next engulf Iran more directly, said Matthew Levitt, a regional expert at the Washington Institute think tank.\n\"Iran has ultimately one single bright red line when it comes to the prospect of regional war, which is that it not spill over into the borders of Iran,\" Levitt said.\nBut Iran is aware it would pay a price for attacking Israel, said Ali Vaiz, an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank.\n\"The simple reality is that Israel and the U.S. have escalation domination,\" Vaiz said. \"If Iran wants to retaliate in a way that isn't symbolic, it will invite a much more devastating blow — which at this time it cannot absorb.\"\nVaiz said it might be smarter for Iranian leaders to avoid escalating tensions.\n\"The Iranian leadership has had a few tactical setbacks, but strategically they are winning, in the sense that Israel has not been able to reach its strategic objectives in Gaza, and it has isolated itself internationally,\" he said.\nAside from the military mobilizations, diplomats have scrambled from one regional capital to another in recent weeks with the aim of quelling tensions. Last week, the U.S. spearheaded a last-ditch effort to forge a cease-fire in Gaza, hoping that a breakthrough in negotiations would mollify Iran and Hezbollah's demands for revenge.\nThat effort appears to have played a role in at least delaying an Iranian retaliation. In a statement Wednesday, Iran's mission to the United Nations said the government \"will meticulously calibrate its response to prevent any potential negative consequences that could affect a possible ceasefire.\"",

FOX23 reported Rodney Hunter was arrested earlier this week in connection to the north Tulsa shooting and would be prosecuted in either Tribal or Federal court because he falls under the McGirt ruling. According to the affidavit, Hunter is charged with murder in Indian Country. UPDATE (6/10) — The Tulsa Police Department arrested Rodney Hunter in connection the shooting that left one man dead on Saturday in north Tulsa. Police say Ray Orcutt was sitting across from a garage sale loudly arguing with Hunter near Pine and Yale. Police say Hunter lives in the neighborhood and told Orcutt to leave the area and they began arguing. At some point, Orcutt turned away from Hunter who then shot him in the back. Hunter took the pistol inside his house and then began trying to aid Orcutt. Officers found the suspect aiding the victim and took over resuscitation efforts until he was transported to the hospital, police say. Orcutt was pronounced dead at the hospital. Hunter falls under the McGirt ruling and will be prosecuted in either Tribal or Federal Court. FOX23 will provide updates as they become available. TULSA, Okla. — Police are investigating a shooting in north Tulsa that left one man dead. Multiple police units and firetrucks were on scene near Pine and Yale, where a man was shot Saturday around 10:30 a.m. Police say the victim and another man got into an altercation which led to the victim being shot in the torso. Officers placed the suspect in custody and began chest compressions on the victim. The victim was taken to the hospital by EMSA where he was pronounced dead. One man in handcuffs was taken away from the scene. Lieutenant Brandon Watkins with the Tulsa Police Department Homicide Unit said police are still investigating what led up to the shooting but they don't believe the victim and suspect knew each other. \"It doesn't sound like it, it sounds like the victim was just in the neighborhood with another person who we still need to find, and an altercation started\" Watkins said. \"This sort of thing could happen anywhere, anytime.\" Here are some photos from the scene: FOX23 is following this and will update once we learn more.",

    "text": "Les faits La «réduflation» est cette tactique de marketing qui consiste, en période d’inflation, à réduire la taille des paquets afin de maintenir l’illusion d’un prix stable — le prix du paquet ne change pas, mais comme il y en a moins dedans, le consommateur en a moins pour son argent. Les entreprises peuvent aussi rogner sur la qualité plutôt que sur la quantité dans le même but ce qui, pour les piles, pourraient théoriquement avoir une incidence sur leur capacité. Je n’ai pas pu faire de tests sur des piles qui auraient été fabriquées avant 2020, mais rien n’indique que ces produits ont été affectés par la «réduflation», indique Julian Self, professeur adjoint de génie chimique à l’École polytechnique de Montréal et spécialiste de la chimie des batteries. «Si l’on va aujourd’hui sur les sites de marques connues pour les piles AA, disons Energizer et Duracell, on voit qu’ils rapportent tous deux une capacité autour de 2000 milliampères-heure [mAh, donc un courant de 2000 milliampères (ce qui correspond à un certain nombre d’électrons passant par un point donné à chaque seconde) qui serait maintenu pendant une heure]», dit-il, en précisant que ces chiffres valent pour les piles dites «alcalines». Or justement, poursuit M. Self, un [«manuel des batteries» datant de 2011](https://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/binary/mheaeworks/31e81714f2ef35b8/18612c103589dd483a7998835a510d00c04a47cd69e7c232c8724c0df672a86f/book-summary.pdf), donc avant la poussée d’inflation qui a débuté pendant la pandémie, indiquait que ce type de pile avait à l’époque une capacité tournant typiquement autour de 1500 mAh, donc un peu moins qu’aujourd’hui. Il ne semble donc pas y avoir une réduction, mais au contraire une amélioration de la capacité des piles, ce qui est d’ailleurs cohérent avec les tendances de l’industrie. Ce même manuel montre en effet que la capacité des piles alcalines bas de gamme a augmenté d’environ 8 % entre 1998 et 2007, et de 35 % dans le haut de gamme. Dans la même veine, ajoute M. Self, la tendance globale pour les dispositifs de stockage d’énergie va clairement dans le sens d’une réduction des prix plutôt que d’une inflation. «Par exemple, a-t-il illustré lors d’un échange de courriels, le prix des batteries lithium-ion, que l’on retrouve dans les laptops, téléphones cellulaires et les voitures électriques, a [diminué par un facteur d’environ 5](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__about.bnef.com_blog_lithium-2Dion-2Dbattery-2Dpack-2Dprices-2Dhit-2Drecord-2Dlow-2Dof-2D139-2Dkwh_&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=zWsix23iThyd3f0PGhhvaYOaW-MpCTXLWNz77OS6IlQ&m=YfreLi5K8HR1c8V_d3nRY-cHlNqmlX7W20yVgkM9ATaIwn-l37XlKxjtQSZF6H7W&s=Z6GKMmyFKuHvAceng4h39vLxLcZi3u6flRrKnCHuZgU&e=) entre 2013 et 2023.» De manière générale, donc, tout indique que l’industrie des piles n’a pas de raison de réduire la qualité de ses produits pour maintenir ses prix. Il y a toutefois un certain nombre de choses qui peuvent donner l’impression que les piles durent moins longtemps. Toutes ne sont fabriquées de la même manière : les piles alcalines durent en général plus longtemps que les autres mais, même à l’intérieur de cette catégorie, le haut et le bas de gamme n’ont pas la même capacité non plus, comme on vient de le voir. Un même appareil pourra donc épuiser ses piles plus vite si on change le type ou la qualité de ses piles. De plus, une même sorte de pile n’aura pas la même durée dans tous les appareils. Ceux-ci ne tirent pas tous la même quantité de courant par seconde, si bien qu’ils épuisent leurs piles à des rythmes très différents — la manuel cité plus haut donne l’exemple de piles AA qui durent 6 heures dans un lecteur CD, mais seulement 2,5 heures dans une brosse à dent électrique. Ces différences peuvent donner l’impression que les piles sont de moins bonne qualité qu’avant, même si rien ne permet de croire que c’est vraiment le cas. Verdict Très peu probable. La tendance générale dans l’industrie des piles n’est pas à l’inflation, mais plutôt à l’inverse. En outre, les spécifications des piles AA de 2024 indiquent plutôt une légère augmentation de leur capacité comparé à avant la pandémie, et non une réduction.",

    "text": "SAN ANTONIO – Despite [freezing temperatures](https://www.ksat.com/weather/2024/01/09/arctic-air-takes-aim-on-texas-with-a-hard-freeze-in-san-antonio-hill-country-next-week/) expected next week, [San Antonio’s Martin Luther King Jr. March and Celebration](https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2024/01/09/what-to-know-about-the-2024-mlk-march-and-celebration-in-san-antonio/) is still on schedule. “First and foremost, we will be marching,” MLK Commission Chair Dwayne Robinson told KSAT. “Nothing in the weather suggests that we will not be able to hold a march. It may be a little bit cold. Dress appropriately, dress warm, but come to march.” KSAT meteorologists expect the temperature could be the lowest for the holiday in more than a decade, with the current low/high forecasted at 19/33 on Monday. In 2022 and 2019, the low temperature for MLK Day in San Antonio was 32 degrees - though the sun warmed marchers in 2022. In 2007, the low temperature was 31 degrees and San Antonio received about half an inch of precipitation, according to KSAT weather archives. San Antonio’s [MLK March](https://www.ksat.com/topic/MLK_March/), in its 37th year, is touted by organizers as the nation’s largest. This year’s event is occurring at a time when equality and inclusion efforts are being [questioned](https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2024/01/05/utsa-said-it-would-create-an-office-to-replace-dei-program-banned-by-new-state-law-now-their-scrapping-those-plans/) in cities, schools and businesses. Robinson said he remains cognizant of the importance of King’s work around social justice. “It’s a constant reminder that the work that King and other civil rights leaders were doing in the early 60s, unfortunately, is still needed today,” Robinson said. Every year, the commission selects a theme to center the march around after reaching out to the public for their input. This year’s theme is “Yesterday’s Dream, Today’s Vision, Tomorrow’s Reality.” “This one, to me, is very appropriate because when you think about themes of the past, the marches and the demonstrations, and you think about what’s going on today with some of the unrest locally and across the country, what does that look like in the future?” he said. Part of the theme’s mission is to influence subsequent programming for the march, including artwork submissions from local youth. Earlier this week, Alexa Villanueva, a student from Cole High School, won the commission’s art contest with her piece titled “My Today, Our Tomorrow.” Villanueva’s work will be a visual representation of the march and commemoration on Monday. An official unveiling and dedication of the artwork took place Tuesday, January 9 at 10 a.m. at the Carver Community Cultural Center. “I am grateful for the opportunity to capture Dr. King’s dream through my artwork, and would like to extend a huge thank you to the City of San Antonio for this honor and opportunity,” Villanueva said Tuesday at a dedication ceremony for the artwork. Robinson said he hopes that part of the message people take away from the march is the need to treat one another with respect. “A large part of the reality is that it impacts all of us,” Robinson said. “The bad news is that we treat each other a certain way, and it really is irrelevant (to) what your skin color is, what your height is. We treat each other wrong. The good news is that we can solve it one person at a time.” For more information on the march, visit their [website](https://www.sa.gov/Directory/Departments/CE/Special-Events/MLK).",
