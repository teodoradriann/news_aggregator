    "title": "Amazonas: 16 são presos em confronto entre policiais e garimpeiros",
    "text": "Ao menos 16 pessoas foram detidas, nesta quarta-feira (21), em Humaitá, no sul do Amazonas, durante um confronto entre garimpeiros e policiais. Segundo a secretaria estadual de Segurança Pública, pessoas insatisfeitas com uma ação da Polícia Federal (PF) contra o garimpo ilegal na região atacaram prédios de órgãos públicos e reagiram violentamente à chegada das forças de segurança. Atacados, os agentes federais receberam apoio de policiais militares e civis do Amazonas e também de policiais militares do estado vizinho, Rondônia, que se deslocaram para apoiar as tropas amazonenses. Imagens que circulam nas redes sociais registraram garimpeiros avançando pela região central de Humaitá enquanto lançavam rojões contra os policiais, que regiram disparando balas de borracha e bombas de gás contra os agressores. De acordo com as autoridades, o ataque dos garimpeiros foi uma reação à deflagração, na segunda-feira (20), da chamada Operação Prensa, realizada conjuntamente pela PF, Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (Ibama) e Fundação Nacional dos Povos Indígenas (Funai). Segundo a PF, nos três primeiros dias de operação, as equipes inutilizaram 223 balsas usadas por garimpeiros que estavam atuando de forma ilegal no Rio Madeira e seus afluentes. “A prática da atividade na região, além de causar danos ao meio ambiente e à saúde pública em virtude da contaminação do rio por mercúrio e cianeto, também interfere na cultura de povos tradicionais, uma vez que áreas indígenas chegaram a ser invadidas pelos criminosos na região”, informou a PF, em nota divulgada hoje. Ainda de acordo com a PF, policiais federais e servidores dos demais órgãos públicos seguirão percorrendo municípios do sul do Amazonas por prazo indeterminado.

    "text": "STORY: The Dow registered its fourth record high in five days on Thursday, after stronger-than-expected monthly retail sales and a chip stock rally powered by Taiwan Semiconductor's upbeat forecast.\nThe Dow added more than a third of a percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended essentially flat.\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest contract chipmaker, gained nearly 10% after the company beat Wall Street estimates for profit, and forecast a jump in fourth-quarter revenue, driven by demand for artificial intelligence chips.\nThat helped propel other chip stocks, including AI-trade favorite and TSMC customer Nvidia.\nThe chip rally came just days after a downbeat forecast from chip equipment maker ASML sparked a global stock selloff.\nMike Mussio is president of FBB Capital Partners.\n\"I think we're in a cycle of high-quality businesses that are priced for, kind of, perfection. To be in a position where based on the current earnings report for the prior quarter and then importantly guidance going forward is going to make a difference. And we've seen you have two great examples in the same sector of one that was down 10-plus percent and one that was up 10 percent on that earnings number. So there's some idiosyncratic things going on with each of those companies, kind of very different though in the same industries. I think this is a good reminder for investors to be monitoring not only what they're invested in, but what their position sizing is on the other side of these moves, and whether or not they should be rebalancing.\"\nIn other movers, shares of Netflix, down 2% at the close, rose more than 3% in after-hours trading after the streaming service said it picked up 5.1 million subscribers in the third quarter, topping Wall Street estimates by more than 1 million users.\nAnd shares of Travelers Companies and Blackstone Group both advanced after the insurer and the money manager posted third-quarter profit which beat market expectations.\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to their delegation meeting at Hyderabad House, in New Delhi, India, on December 6, 2021.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi played a pivotal role in preventing a potential Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine, a CNN report has claimed.\nAccording to the report, citing two senior officials, the United States had been preparing rigorously for a potential nuclear strike by Russia on Ukraine.\nThe report claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s outreach to Vladimir Putin, along with the intervention of other countries, played an important role in averting a nuclear disaster.\nThe officials told the US-based network that the Joe Biden administration was concerned that Russia might use a tactical nuclear weapon to provide a deadly blow to Ukraine’s war efforts.\nAmid the threat, the US urged India to intervene to discourage Russia from any misadventures.\nUS officials say that outreach and public statements from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped avert a crisis, CNN reported.\n“One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, and encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,” the senior administration official told CNN.\n“I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be. I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,” the officer said.\nIndia hasn’t directly criticised Russia. However, PM Modi told Putin that this is not the era of war.\nCNN reported that Russian units were in danger of being surrounded, precipitating the danger of nuclear attack.\nIt said Russia was also circulating a false flag story about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which could have been used as a ruse for a nuclear strike.\n“We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,” a senior administration official said. “And at no point did we ever see any indications of the types of steps that we would’ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.”\nWith inputs from ANI\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

He mentioned that there is the prospect of new energy connections of Europe with Egypt and the Middle East through Greece, while the vertical corridor initiative will pave the way for a clean hydrogen system in Southeast Europe.\nChatting online with Michalis Mathioulakis, Academic Director of the Greek Energy Forum, Pyatt emphasized that the energy transition is irreversible, isolated from political developments on both sides of the Atlantic. “The whole planet is screamingthat we have to take measures,” he said characteristically.\nHe argued that the supply of many raw materials needed to be increased in order to reduce dependence on China. In this direction, there are also Greek companies that invest in the US and can acquire an important role.\nAsked about the cooperation of the US with Europe, Pyatt pointed out that the interests are common, many issues are maturing and Europe realizes that its economy and its destiny are linked to those of the US.\n“We are major trading partners, our views are fundamentally consistent, and the goal is to expand our cooperation and competition with China,” said the Assistant secretary for Energy of the US Department of State.\nHe added that alignment is needed in the energy transition, with technologies that will advance in such a way that there are corresponding benefits around the world.\nUS Energy\nSubscribe to our Newsletters Enter your information below to receive our weekly newsletters with the latest insights, opinion pieces and current events straight to your inbox.",
