    "text": "2024-09-13 09:37:33\nVolkswagen has officially terminated the agreement that guaranteed job security for its German employees. The contract was signed with the unions in 1994 and has been extended several times. Thus, layoffs will be possible at the automaker from July next year. This is causing concern among almost 300,000 employees.\nThe measure also ends regulations on temporary employment and internships at VW’s German plants. Human resources director Guinar Kilian says he is ready to quickly sit down for talks with unions to discuss a new agreement and wages.\nAt the beginning of the month, Europe’s largest carmaker announced that it was considering closing plants in Germany for the first time. The group is struggling with overcapacity, which amounts to half a million unsold cars. Volkswagen is suffering from declining demand for electric cars and fierce Chinese competition. The German Workers’ Council has announced that it will not accept factory closures and layoffs for operational reasons.\nVW employs almost 300,000 people in Germany. In addition to the main factory in Wolfsburg, the group also has plants in Hanover, Emden, Osnabrück, Braunschweig, Salzgitter, Kassel, Zwickau, Dresden and Chemnitz.",

    "text": "In so many ways, Pittsburgh is better now than it was when I was growing up in the ‘80s and ‘90s. I mean, it was home and I loved it — but unless you really have a thing for abandoned houses, abandoned factories, abandoned everything (OK, and maybe I did at one point), this is just objectively a better time to be alive in Pittsburgh.\nBut there’s one thing that’s way worse, and I don’t know how to fix it: winter.\nWinter is a pretty essential part of the little-kid calendar — snow days (and two-hour delays), Christmas, sledding, ice hockey, snowball fights, tackle football in the snow. Now it’s just trash.\nWhether it’s due to global warming, El Nino, or whatever, winter is just cold, dark, gray/brown, soaking wet and seemingly endless. Yeah, there’s cold shit dropping out of the sky, but it definitely isn’t snow. What’ll it be today — hail, freezing rain, ice fog, thunder snow, a giant Coke Slushie dropped by God?\nWhat does this have to do with housing? Well, despite the varied precipitation, one thing remains true: suddenly some of the very things that set a house apart on our good days — a distinctive view, a verdant hillside of undevelopable green — are kind of your worst enemy for a few months. This too shall pass. But buyer beware and all.\nFor sale:\n3516 Campus St.,$339,900. Brighton Heights/North Side\nHolding on to petty hatreds is a bad look in general, and the arrival of a new year is as good a reason as any to let them go. But they’ll have to pry the hatred of 1960s aluminum awnings out of my cold, dead heart. Way too often, you see a charming brick Pittsburgh foursquare like this, and you just have to imagine what it looks like without the metal awning. Well, this one has nothing (!) and it’s kind of great. Though Brighton Heights is on the least convenient side of the North Side (for everything except going to that thrift shop in Bellevue), it’s generally quiet and full of well-built homes like these. If you still pine for the sound of raindrops hammering away on creaky old metal, you can just buy tiny tap shoes for the local squirrels or something.\n1901 Termon Ave. (Unit 1),$1,200/month. Brighton Heights/North Side\nYellow brick, bright pink trim, a second (and third) floor — this place doesn’t have it all, but it has a lot. Oddly, the bricked-in fireplace inside is of a different, dark red variety. There’s a cinderblock “garage” out of the way in an alley, which is where all garages should be sent in a perfect world. It specifies “up to 2 pets admitted with additional pet rent” — which does sound insane when you put it like that — but makes (some) sense when you think about it.\nFor sale:\n66 Sylvania Ave.,$79,900. Beltzhoover.\nOkay, I don’t know a lot about Beltzhoover. What goes on in Beltzhoover? Are they properly referred to as Beltzhooverians, or Beltzhooverites, or something else? Can you commute to work with a sled in the winter? Sure, there’s probably a reason that this house — even with a covered porch, new furnace, and hot water heater — costs about the same as a parking spot in Boston. And why the price was just cut by $10,000. Maybe a big reason. (And … here it is. The rooms are just unfinished shells). But at this price — and some sweat equity — there’s something to build on here.\n522 E. Warrington Ave.,$1,375/month. Allentown\n“Restore the Brown Line!” sounds like some kind of home remedy for constipation (or worse). But it could also be the key to making Allentown’s revival stick. There used to be a branch of “The T,” Pittsburgh’s light rail — called The Brown Line — that went right through Allentown. And, well, the tracks are still there; you might as well use them for something.\nHere’s a nice historic wood-frame house with a restored exterior (and, well, the standard doctor’s-office-minimalist look inside) a short walk from Allentown’s suddenly booming main drag: (Bottlerocket, Inner Groove, Alla Famiglia, Leon’s Caribbean, Grim Wizard Coffee, etc.). With a functioning Brown Line, this location would be even more attractive.\nFor sale:\n335 Sweetbriar St.,$298,000. Mt. Washington.\nSo, you want to live on top of a mountain. You sure about this, kid? Because it’s great for like nine months of the year … and then there’s January and February. But most of the time, this is pretty much peak Pittsburgh living. Cherish it. That weird little water feature out front can go, though.\n107 Dilworth St.,$1,100/month. Mt. Washington.\nIf a funny little house behind a white picket fence on Mt. Washington is your kind of piece of the American dream, well here it is. Mt. Washington is great — there’s million-dollar views just up the street, decent places to eat (though rarely on Grandview — that’s for the tourists), and most of what you need for daily life in walking distance. Just don’t get drunk and try to climb down the mountain “the short way.” That’s not how any of this works. When the rescue team rappels down the hillside to grab you, they will not be amused.",

    "text": "Promising Phase Ib Data for UbiVac’s DPV-001 in Combination Immunotherapy for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer Pioneering the World's 1st Dark Matter Cancer Immunotherapy\nUbiVac's DPV-001 Dark Matter combo Immunotherapy triples response rate and progression-free survival over PD-1 alone for patients with r/m head and neck cancer\nThe still maturing median PFS we are seeing of over 9 months for PD-1 naive 1L r/m HNSCC, compares favorably with the 3.2 month median PFS reported for Keytruda monotherapy in the KN-048 study” — Rom S. Leidner, MD HOUSTON, TX, UNITED STATES, November 7, 2024 / EINPresswire.com / -- UbiVac, www.ubivac.com , a private, clinical-stage immuno-oncology company today announced the presentation of updated results from a Phase 1b study evaluating clinical efficacy and safety of DPV-001, UbiVac’s lead investigational cancer vaccine immunotherapy, containing cancer’s dark matter, in combination with sequenced checkpoint inhibition (anti-PD-1; retifanlimab, INCMGA00012), with or without anti-GITR agonist (INCAGN01876), in adult patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) (NCT04470024) at this year’s Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting. The phase Ib study is sponsored by Providence Cancer Institute of Oregon.\n• 56% objective clinical response rate and a progression-free survival of +9.3 months for patients receiving DPV-001 combination immunotherapy as first line treatment for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC\n• Patients that had not responded to prior treatment with anti-PD-1 had a 33% objective clinical response rate and a progression-free survival of +6.2 months\n• DPV-001 immunotherapy contains cancer’s dark matter and is designed as an off-the-shelf combination therapy option for the majority of solid cancers and for patients of all HLA backgrounds\n• A T cell receptor isolated from a responding patient recognized cancers of the lung, head and neck, kidney and melanoma.\nCancer’s dark matter represents a spectrum of previously unknown proteins that have recently been identified as antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells but not on normal cells or the thymus. Some of these dark matter proteins appear to be responsible for cancer’s malignant properties, making them valuable targets for an anti-cancer immune response. UbiVac believes DPV-001 is the first cancer immunotherapy to include cancer’s dark matter in a form that can induce a destructive anti-cancer immune response and established its therapeutic efficacy in more than a decade’ worth of preclinical studies.\nUbiVac’s DRibble Platform Vaccine (DPV) technology is a novel first-in-class cancer vaccine immunotherapy. DPV-001 was developed to be used as combination immunotherapy for most solid cancers, including cancers of the breast, lung, prostate, stomach, colon, pancreas, ovary, brain, and others. DPV-001 contains recently described non-canonical, non-mutated shared alternative neoantigens, also termed “cancer’s dark matter”, plus more than 300 antigens overexpressed by the average solid cancer. This allows DPV-001 to be available off-the-shelf without having to manufacture a patient specific vaccine. Additionally, DPV-001 can be administered without having to match a patients HLA tissue antigens.\nThese data will be viewable at the Late-Breaking Abstract Session on November 8, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting held 8-10 November, in Houston, TX. Poster No. 1481 entitled, “Off-the-shelf dark matter immunotherapy in head & neck cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical efficacy”, will report that patients that had not previously been treated with anti-PD-1 and received DPV-001 as part of their combination immunotherapy had a 56% response rate and a progression-free survival of +9.3 months (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04470024). While patients that had not responded to prior anti-PD-1, and received DPV-001 as part of their subsequent combination immunotherapy, had a 33% response rate and a progression-free survival of +6.2 months. Consistent with preclinical data, early mechanistic study results suggest that the therapeutic strategy is generating immune cells that can recognize and destroy a wide range of cancer types.\n\"At the outset of this trial, I was admittedly agnostic about the addition of a broadly targeted, proteosome-blocked DPV-001 vaccine, but the bioactivity that has clinically manifested, in terms of disease response plus in-step irAE - which were readily managed with short-course prednisone - suggested that despite a small sample size, the clinical activity is credible and consistent with the \"no free lunch\" axiom in immunotherapy: no combinatorial toxicity, no combinatorial efficacy. The still maturing median PFS we are seeing of over 9 months for PD-1 naive 1L r/m HNSCC, compares favorably with the 3.2 month median PFS reported for Keytruda monotherapy in the KN-048 study, but we really need to wait for OS data to mature. Despite receiving a year of serial vaccine injections, patients on this trial have been asking why they can't recieve even more DPV-001, something we really haven't seen before,\" said Dr. Rom Leidner, Director of Immune Cell Experimental Therapy and Co-director of the Head & Neck Cancer Program at the Earle A. Chiles Research Institute, a division of the Providence Cancer Institute of Oregon.\nHNSCC is the sixth most common cancer and accounts for 890,000 cases and 450,000 deaths worldwide annually. UbiVac believes the early data presented here suggests combining DPV-001 with anti-PD-1 and/or other immunotherapies may provide a treatment to further improve patient outcomes for HNSCC and other solid cancers.\nAbout Providence\nProvidence Cancer Institute, a part of Providence St. Joseph Health, offers the latest in cancer services, including diagnostic, treatment, prevention, education, support and internationally renowned research. Providence Cancer Institute is home to the Earle A. Chiles Research Institute, a world-class translational cancer immunotherapy research center located within the Robert W. Franz Cancer Center in Portland, Oregon, and is a recognized leader in the field of cancer immunotherapy since 1993.\nVisit www.providenceoregon.org/cancer to learn more.\nAbout UbiVac\nUbiVac is a privately held, clinical stage immunotherapy company engaged in the research and development of immune activators and therapeutic vaccines to combat cancer. DPV-001 is UbiVac’s lead agent and is a first-in-class platform technology that couples an off-the-shelf DC-targeted microvesicle containing cancer’s dark matter plus more than 300 cancer antigens for most adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancers. DPV-001 also contains multiple TLR/NOD agonists and DAMPs that are effective at supporting anti-cancer immune responses. UbiVac believes that DPV-001 is highly complementary to current and developing immunotherapy, adoptive immunotherapy, chemotherapy and small molecule drug portfolios, and preliminary clinical data suggests it may be effective at increasing response rates in patients that have failed to respond to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1. UbiVac also has a pipeline of agents under development for the treatment of melanoma and thyroid cancer, and to prevent cancer in patients at high risk of developing disease.\nUbiVac is currently raising funding from accredited investors.
