    "text": "I am pleased to offer my strong support for Alan Lazar’s candidacy for the LVUSD Board of Education.\nAs a dedicated parent with children currently in our schools, Alan understands firsthand the challenges students face today. He will bring a vital, fresh perspective to the board and serve as a passionate advocate for our children’s success.\nAlan’s past experience supporting our schools and his commitment to being a strong voice for parents is undeniable, and I know he will work tirelessly to represent the needs of our community.\nOne area where Alan and I are particularly closely aligned is the critical issue of limiting cellphone distractions during the school day. He will be a powerful advocate for new policies that help our students stay focused on their education and well-being.\nAlan recognizes that tackling the dangerous effects of social media and unfettered cellphone access during the school day is key to improving both the academic performance and the mental health of our students.\nAlan Lazar’s dedication to fostering a productive learning environment while addressing the social and emotional needs of our students makes him the right choice for our community.\nI urge everyone to vote for Alan—he will be a dedicated and effective advocate for students, parents, and educators.\nDallas Lawrence\nCalabasas\nDallas Lawrence is vice president of the Las Virgenes Unified School District Board of Education.\nI am writing to endorse Alan Lazar for the LVUSD School Board election this November.\nI have had the pleasure of knowing Alan and his family for many years now, and I can confidently say he possesses the outstanding qualities and skills to excel in this position. Alan’s dedication to LVUSD is clear.\nOur kids have grown up together and during that time, very few parents have been as involved and dedicated to improving LVUSD as Alan. I have also had the opportunity to interact with Alan in the business world and I can confidently say that Alan’s ethical standards are solid and unshakable.\nAs a citizen of Calabasas, a parent of three current LVUSD students, and as a former LVUSD student myself, I believe that it is important to elect leaders who are committed to improving our community.\nAlan has demonstrated his commitment to public service and community volunteering, and also sits on several industry boards, as a successful businessman.\nIt’s understandable why all four mayors in our school district have endorsed Alan, along with 12 other City Council members.\nThe most important thing for me is that my kids have the best academic opportunities available to them, and a well-rounded education without ideology of any sort.\nI strongly urge you to vote for Alan Lazar in the upcoming election. I am confident that he will make a positive impact for our schools and our children as an LVUSD School Board member.\nDaniel Schwartz\nCalabasas",

    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY ( [KFOR](http://kfor.com)) – The National Reining Horse Association is a close knit circle. “You’re competing against one another,” said Brandon Brant of Belle Center, Ohio. “But then something like this happens. It’s unbelievable how everybody’s pulled together.” When tragedy struck at Brant’s barn, about an hour north of Columbus, the news quickly made its way to Oklahoma. “The first 911 call went in at 12:15 Ohio time, which was 11:15 here. By 12:00 here, this place was as somber as you’ve ever seen,” said Sean Johnson, a horse trainer from Tulsa and Brant’s best friend. Earlier this month, flames engulfed Brant’s 60,000 square-foot barn. The fire sent one man, Eric Priest, to the ICU and killed 44 horses. “The flick of a finger and it’s gone,” said Brant. “It’s awful. It is the worst thing I’ve ever experienced and like I said, I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. I mean, this is one of the biggest tragedies in our industry.” Perhaps unsurprisingly Oklahomans and others all around the world have stepped up to help Brant, Priest and their customers get back in the saddle. Over the last week or so, hundreds of donations have been piling up at the NRHA Derby in Oklahoma City. “This generosity is huge,” said Johnson. “These people, they’ve lost everything.They lost all their equipment, their help, right down to their clothes. I mean, they lost their hopes and dreams.” The donated items will be auctioned off next week June 24 through June 26. “It’s unbelievable. The immense support from Oklahoma City, the NRHA,” said Brant. “I can never thank everybody. I could try but it’s just so immense.” More information about the efforts to help Brant, Priest and their customers can be found [here](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fprofile.php%3Fid%3D61560795390393&data=05%7C02%7CCaroline.Sellers%40kfor.com%7C73af681114b94c0b986608dc9208a48d%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C0%7C0%7C638545813013886996%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=MejAA6pPrI%2B9LatPybJfx98E69qIdrFq9uDZZEVsWnU%3D&reserved=0).
