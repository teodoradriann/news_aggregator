    "title": "Mark Halperin Says Cackling Kamala's Terrible CNN Town Hall Performance Was the \"Last Straw for a Lot of Democrats\" - 🔔 The Liberty Daily",
    "text": "( DCNF )—Journalist Mark Halperin said Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris’ “performance” during her Wednesday CNN town hall left many Democrats feeling resigned about her candidacy. Harris faced criticism for her indirect answers during the event from CNN host Dana Bash and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod shortly following the town hall . Halperin , on his 2WAY platform , asserted Democrats now realize Harris won’t have the chance to sharpen her skills, with the presidential campaign nearing its end. Trending: All Recombinant “Vaccines” and Adjuvants – Not Just Covid-19 Jabs – Are Now Implicated in DNA Contamination Scandal WATCH: “We’re not going to go overboard here and say, ‘It’s over, [former President Donald] Trump’s going to win.’ But a lot of what we’re going to talk about today is not great for Kamala Harris. Again, it doesn’t mean Trump’s a great guy in the eyes of all of America,” Halperin said. “It doesn’t mean Trump’s going to win, but where we are right now is there are increasing problems for the Democratic Party. You saw it in the punditry from Democrats last night on CNN after the town hall.” “You saw it on morning television, where Democratic pundits, trying to be poker-faced, are clearly feeling what a lot of Democratic donors are feeling and Democratic elected officials are feeling, which is there’s no time left for her to get better,” he added. “And I think the biggest story of the news cycle is, along with ‘Trump loves Hitler,’ which we’ll talk about, is her performance last night was the last straw for a lot of Democrats. No more ‘the more she does it, the better she’ll get.’” The journalist then prompted Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine to share his perception of the town hall “and why it’s considered in Democratic circles to be such a disaster.” Turrentine started by asserting Harris effectively advanced her messaging accusing Trump of being “a fascist” before expressing concern about how the vice president performed. “We saw this in 2019, and there was a hope that as she did more interviews and settled down and got more comfortable, that you would see kind of a human being with some passion, some humor. Because we talk about it — Trump is having fun. Like it is clear as day that he’s feeling pretty good,” he said. “So I think the frustrating part to Democrats is it is clear that she is just not really capable right now of answering that question: ‘Why should I be for you?’ And I hope that enough voters decide that she doesn’t have to, but I don’t feel confident about that.” Harris currently trails Trump in all of the seven top swing states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Halperin asserted Tuesday that Trump will be president-elect on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory persists.",

Her mission is to empower leaders, enabling them to reclaim their time and build their empire.

I kickstart my morning with a quick Peloton workout, ensuring I’m physically energized for the day ahead. Spending precious moments with my two boys in the morning is essential; it sets a positive tone for the day. My older son heads to pre-k, and the nanny takes care of my youngest, Oliver, giving me dedicated work time.\nI have a cozy office in my house, separate from the main living area, which allows me to maintain focus. In the morning, I dive into my inbox, attend to emails, and engage in writing tasks, which might include articles, social media posts, or progress on my upcoming book due by the end of 2023. I also manage meetings and follow up with potential candidates for open positions, all while advancing ongoing projects and addressing business development needs.\nIn the afternoon, I switch gears to pick up my son from school and cherish quality time with both my boys. The key to my productivity lies in a balanced approach: moving my body, actively pursuing my goals, and, most importantly, keeping my family, which is my top value, at the forefront of my daily priorities. This harmonious blend fuels my productivity and fulfillment throughout the day.\nHow do you bring ideas to life?\nBringing ideas to life involves a combination of collaboration and swift action. Here’s a breakdown of my process:\n1. Conceptualization: Start by brainstorming and generating ideas. This can be done individually or through collaboration with others. Group discussions often lead to a wider range of perspectives and creative solutions.\n2. Evaluation: Assess the feasibility and potential impact of each idea. Consider factors like resources required, time constraints, and alignment with goals or objectives.\n3. Planning: Once a viable idea is selected, create a detailed plan outlining the steps needed to execute it. Define roles and responsibilities if working with a team.\n4. Action: Don’t delay. Begin implementing my idea as soon as possible. Procrastination can lead to missed opportunities or diminished enthusiasm.\n5. Adaptation: Be open to adjusting the plan as I progress. Not every detail can be anticipated, and flexibility is key to overcoming unexpected challenges.\n6. Feedback: Continuously seek feedback from stakeholders, team members, or potential users. Their input can help refine the idea and make it even better.\n7. Persistence: The process of bringing an idea to life can be challenging. Staying committed, remain resilient in the face of setbacks, and keep refining and iterating as necessary.\n8. Celebration: When the idea reaches fruition, take a moment to celebrate success and acknowledge the efforts of those involved.\nBy combining collaboration with a bias toward action and adaptability, I can effectively bring ideas to life and turn them into tangible achievements.\nWhat’s one trend that excites you?\nThe trend of companies prioritizing employee well-being and development is indeed exciting. It’s a shift towards a more human-centric approach to work, and it has the potential to create a positive ripple effect not only within organizations, but also in society as a whole. When employees are happier, more engaged, and supported in their growth, they are likely to be more productive, creative, and innovative. This, in turn, can lead to more sustainable businesses and a better quality of life for individuals. It’s a trend that aligns with the idea that when people thrive at work, they contribute to a happier and more fulfilled world beyond the workplace, and that’s truly inspiring.\nWhat is one habit that helps you be productive?\nOne habit that helps me be productive is setting clear and prioritized daily goals. Each morning, I identify the most important tasks I need to accomplish and create a to-do list with a clear order of priority. This habit helps me stay focused and organized throughout the day, ensuring that I tackle the most critical tasks first and maintain a sense of accomplishment as I check them off my list.\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\nThe advice to trust the process and have faith in the journey is valuable. Here’s a message to my younger self:\nDear Younger Self,\nTrust the process of life. There will be moments of uncertainty and challenges that may seem insurmountable, but remember that everything happens for a reason. The struggles and successes, the highs and lows – they all play a part in shaping who you become. Have faith that the path you’re on will lead to valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. Even when things don’t make sense at the moment, they will eventually fall into place. Embrace each experience as a stepping stone toward a brighter future.\nWith patience and perseverance, you’ll find your way. Keep believing in yourself, keep learning, and keep moving forward. The journey is as important as the destination, and it will all be worth it.\nSincerely, Your Wiser Self\nTell us something you believe almost nobody agrees with you.\nWhile the idea of waking up early is often associated with productivity, I believe that the optimal wake-up time can vary from person to person. Some individuals are naturally more productive during later hours, and it’s essential to align your schedule with your circadian rhythms and personal preferences. It’s not always necessary to wake up super early to be productive. The key is to find a routine that works best for you and allows you to maximize your productivity and overall well-being.\nThe habit of embracing discomfort and taking risks. Stepping outside your comfort zone is where personal growth and learning often occur. I recommend that everyone should make a conscious effort to get uncomfortable regularly. Challenge yourself, take risks, and put yourself in situations where you might face rejection or failure. It’s in these moments of discomfort that you discover your true potential, build resilience, and learn valuable lessons. Embracing discomfort is a powerful catalyst for personal growth and can lead to meaningful and transformative experiences.\nWhen you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do?\nWhen I find myself overwhelmed or struggling to focus, I turn to physical activity. Whether it’s a workout, dancing, or simply taking a walk, moving my body helps me reset and re-energize. It clears my mind, reduces stress, and allows me to return to my tasks with a renewed sense of focus and clarity. Physical activity is my go-to method for regaining balance and productivity when things get overwhelming.\nOne of the most impactful strategies that has propelled my career and business growth is prioritizing relationships. I’ve found that cultivating meaningful connections with others, both personally and professionally, can open doors and create opportunities that might not have been possible otherwise. I actively engage with my network by consistently sharing my business endeavors on social media platforms. This not only keeps my network informed about my work, but also encourages referrals and recommendations. In fact, the majority of my clients have come through referrals from friends, family, and connections within my network. By building and maintaining strong relationships, I’ve not only gained valuable clients, I have also established a reputation as someone trustworthy and reliable in my field. This strategy has driven business growth and enriched my career with a network of supportive individuals who continue to contribute to my success.\nA failure in my career has been underestimating my capability and my worth in previous roles that I took or turned down. One example is making a decision to give a role to someone less qualified due to personal reasons, resulting in taking a step down from a position I had worked hard to earn. From these experiences, I learned the importance of pausing, reflecting, and taking the time to carefully consider my decisions.\nI realized that quick, impulsive responses based on short-term benefits can sometimes lead to long-term setbacks. It taught me the value of a more deliberate and proactive approach to decision-making. I now prioritize looking at the long-term rewards and considering the impact of my choices on my career and personal goals. These failures served as valuable lessons in making decisions that align with my desired outcomes and contribute to my future success.\nWhat is one business idea you’re willing to give away to our readers?\nIf you’re seeking cost-effective support for your business, consider utilizing Handshake to find interns. It’s a win-win situation where you can offload tasks and provide valuable experience to someone in your field. Handshake is a platform used by colleges nationwide to connect current and alumni students with open positions.\nLinkedIn is a crucial software tool for me. I use it for networking in my business and also to identify potential candidates for roles I’m recruiting for clients.\nWhat is the best $100 you recently spent?\nI invested in a ticket to attend The Powerhouse Women event in Scottsdale, AZ. It provided valuable information, motivation in my business goals, reconnections with friends, and new connections with inspiring women in business, leading to valuable resources.\nI’ve gained significant value from “The Learning Leader Show” with Ryan Hawk due to its insightful and brilliant guest speakers. Additionally, “Buy Back Your Time” by Dan Martell has equipped me with valuable tools to scale my business and reclaim more time in my day.\nWhat’s a movie or series you recently enjoyed and why?\nThe recent movie, “Barbie” was enjoyable because it addresses women’s challenges and empowerment in a thoughtful way. Films that explore these themes can be not only entertaining, but also thought-provoking and inspiring. It encouraged important conversations and reflection on gender equality and feminism in society today.\nKey learnings:\n● Prioritizing relationships, both personal and professional, is a crucial driver of career and business success.\n● Embracing discomfort and taking calculated risks fosters personal growth and development.\n● Effective decision-making involves pausing, reflecting, and considering the long-term consequences of choices.\n● Utilizing online platforms like Handshake can provide cost-effective support for businesses through internships.\n● Engaging in physical activity, such as exercise or dancing, is an effective strategy to reset and regain focus when feeling overwhelmed or unfocused.\n ",

    "title": "Opinion - Deborah Bizarria: When the vote becomes dogma: the consequences of instrumentalizing faith",
    "text": "Recent data from Atlas Intel to CNN Brazil reveal that only 18% of Brazilians trust evangelical churches today, while 73% do not deposit credit in them. This decline in trust is not the result of chance; It directly reflects the actions and omissions of the leaders and members of these churches, which often transformed faith into an instrument of material power and prosperity, to the detriment of the central values ​​of the Gospel.\nSince 2018, CNT/MDA has already pointed to a retraction in the credibility of the Church – in line with both Catholics and Protestants. That year, 40.1% of respondents considered the most reliable institution in the country. This number fell to 34.3% in 2019 and parked by 25.8% in 2020, showing a clear and persistent negative trend.\nIn many congregations, the pulpit, which should be a space for reception and spiritual orientation, has become an extension of the electoral stage. In 2022, several pastors not only endorsed candidates, but even conditioned the faith on the vote, imposing political alignment as a religious requirement. Anyone who did not follow this guidance was seen as “spiritual deserter”, generating internal divisions and driving people away.\nIn addition to politicization, scandals involving religious leaders further corrode the credibility of the institutions. The dissemination of irregular practices, deviations of resources and internal conflicts amplify the feeling that moral coherence was in the background.\nThe religious influence on political behavior depends on the credibility of leaders and the quality of messages within congregations, according to researchers Paul Djupe and Jacob Neheisel. When faith is instrumentalized for political or financial purposes, this influence delegitimates, and the removal of members or supporters becomes inevitable.\nIt is important to recognize that many communities will continue to choose politicians in exchange for power, without any improvement in the quality of life of their supporters or surroundings. Each believer’s commitment must be, above all, with God and with the people under his care, not with the defense of the reputation of the “evangelicals.” Throughout the history of humanity, inside and outside Christianity, it was very badly committed in the name of some deity.\nHowever, it is expected that there will be reflection in the media where change is possible. The recovery of confidence requires humility to recognize errors and willingness to change. Faith cannot be used as a currency of exchange, whether by political power, financial or emotional blessing. If some communities want to play a community reference role, they need to put God at the center of their mission.\nRevising failures is the first step to overcome them. Recognizing that the electoral use of the altar was a moral error, it will be possible to work for a sincere approach with the community, rescuing fundamental values ​​such as honesty, solidarity and service. This is where churches can meet the path of public respect.\nHowever, this does not mean that there is no room for people who – but other things – are religious in public life. It means that it is necessary to define an agenda that prioritizes not only the common good but what the Bible calls on: take care of the poor, the orphan, the widow, and the foreigner. Above particular interests or specific groups, even from other evangelicals.\nGift Link: Did you like this text? Subscriber can release seven free hits from any link per day.

    "text": "Driving through the rolling, densely forested mountains of West Virginia and into the valley where Wardensville (population 379) lies, it’s surprisingly tough not to stop. Maybe the life-sized red cow-with-a-cowboy-hat sculpture at the [Lost River Trading Post](https://www.lostrivertradingpost.com/) catches your eye. Or those umbrella-topped picnic tables near the [Wardensville Garden Market](https://farmsworkwonders.org/wardensville-garden-market/) beckon. Or you might have heard about [Mack’s Bingo Kitchen](https://farmsworkwonders.org/macks-bingo-kitchen/) and its crispy, juicy chicken sandwich. Since 2016, this Appalachian town has been revivified by a nonprofit called Farms Work Wonders (FWW). The market and restaurant above—plus [Lewis Farm](https://farmsworkwonders.org/lewis-farm/), Mack’s Bingo Bakery, and [Dakota Glass Works](https://farmsworkwonders.org/dakota-glass-works/)—fall under the expanding FWW canopy, which aims to grow everything from veggies to the area’s economy. The group’s primary focus, though, is supporting local youth. In 2013, it started small when Washington insiders Paul Yandura and his partner, Don Hitchcock, “retired” from D.C. to rural West Virginia. They got real estate licenses and bought their own first listing, envisioning it as a community hub and trading post. The fact that 10,000 cars and trucks pass through Wardensville daily meant likely foot traffic. (The town is near the busy intersection of I-81 and I-66 in nearby Virginia.) Around the area, Yandura had often heard this sobering refrain: “Young people want to leave; there’s nothing for them to do. We can’t do anything. We’ve tried.” But Yandura—who’d run a consulting firm and had major community organizing experience (he helped the 1994 White House form a gay-and-lesbian outreach office)— appreciated a challenge. Friend and philanthropist Jonathan D. Lewis visited them, offered the support of his foundation (now called the Jonathan D + Mark C. Lewis Foundation), and encouraged “taking a risk.” The Foundation, which Yandura is the CEO of, took on FWW as a pilot project. In 2016, FWW started with a farm and outdoor stand that employed five local adults and five youth. Initially, they sold potatoes, beets, okra, and herbs at a roadside stand. They didn’t have to teach the fundamentals of farming in Appalachia, but the organization emphasized organic and regenerative practices like crop rotation, minimal tillage, and using multiple-season extension structures to help its three quarters of an acre produce year-round. This year, Lewis Farm will grow some seventy-five varieties of food and flowers, including chef favorites such as ginger, turmeric, and specialty peppers. Since its early days, FWW has added the bakery (known for luscious cinnamon rolls), a glass-blowing shop, and, last summer, an inviting restaurant that serves up such specialties as pimento cheese with fried hot peppers, grilled whole trout with roasted squash, and soup beans with farm greens. The group now employs ninety-nine staffers, and this summer, up to fifteen recruited youth ages sixteen to twenty-one will start in the six-week challenge program that develops their workforce and social skills before they’re offered positions as junior crew members at one of FWW’s businesses. That program is followed by a six-month immersion into these “living classrooms.” “The number one thing that highlights this place is that everyone around you really cares,” says Brenden Furlong, nineteen, a part-time market staffer who studies at the local community college and plans to attend West Virginia University. “It really matters to them that you’re successful.” Youth can tailor the program to their goals, and FWW’s “mission team” of advisors is there as needed. Some youth later transition to staff positions. Now a full-time restaurant employee at Mack’s Bingo Kitchen, Elvira Camarillo has honed her knife techniques and solidified her desire to be a chef. Former junior crew member and current restaurant cook Kollin Quarles finds FWW’s emphasis on communication skills especially helpful. “The managers have an open ear for anything,” he says. “As a coworker and on a personal level, you have somebody to trust and talk to.” The work hasn’t been without its hurdles. “As with most places in West Virginia,” Furlong says, “a lot of the time they don’t like outsiders too much, to be perfectly honest.” Yandura understands why. “In Appalachia,” he says, “many times people came in and extracted resources and made a lot of money, whether it was on the beauty or the nature or coal.” But Yandura and Hitchcock are walking the walk—they literally live just off the main road. And what a thriving Main Street it’s become.",

    "text": "BRIGHTON, England (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's top-four ambitions suffered a blow as they lost 4-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Thursday with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager.\nVictory would have put injury-hit Spurs above Manchester City into fourth spot but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot.\nA powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro's penalty gave the hosts a deserved 2-0 lead at halftime as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton's intensity.\nThe visitors responded in the second half with Richarlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over.\nHowever, when Tottenham's late substitute Alejo Veliz fired home from close range in the 75th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header a miraculous comeback suddenly looked possible.\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on 30 points while Tottenham remain fifth on 36, a point behind Manchester City in fourth.\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris)\nOpen Modal ×",

    "title": "دراسة تثير القلق.. هل يجعلنا الذكاء الصناعي أكثر غباءً؟",
    "text": "منذ ظهور «تشات جي بي تي» قبل نحو ثلاث سنوات، أصبح تأثير تقنيات الذكاء الصناعي على التعلُّم موضع جدل واسع. هل هي أدوات مفيدة للتعليم المخصص، أم بوابات للغش الأكاديمي؟\nالأهم من ذلك، هناك قلق متزايد من أن استخدام الذكاء الصناعي قد يؤدي إلى «تبلّد معرفي» أو تراجع في القدرة على التفكير النقدي. إذ يُحذّر البعض من أن اعتماد الطلاب على هذه الأدوات مبكرًا قد يمنعهم من تطوير مهارات التفكير وحل المشكلات الأساسية.\nلكن هل هذا صحيح فعلًا؟ وفقًا لدراسة جديدة من معهد ماساتشوستس للتكنولوجيا (MIT) ، ونشرتها دورية «ذا كوفرسيشن»، يبدو أن الإجابة قد تكون نعم. إذ يشير الباحثون إلى أن استخدام “تشات جي بي تي» لكتابة المقالات قد يؤدي إلى ما يُعرف بـ«الدين المعرفي» وتراجع محتمل في مهارات التعلُّم.\n- الاستثمار في الذكاء الصناعي.. تحديات وفرص في عالم متغير\n- «أوقات عشية» يتساءل: هل يُمكن أن يحل «تشات جي بي تي» محل الأصدقاء؟\n- «تشات جي بي تي» يدخل عالم التسوق.. ذكاء صناعي يرشّح المنتجات ويختصر عناء البحث\nعلى مدى أربعة أشهر، طلب فريق (MIT) من 54 بالغًا كتابة ثلاث مقالات باستخدام «تشات جي بي تي»، أو محرك بحث، أو دون أدوات خارجية (أي الاعتماد على العقل فقط). وقاموا بقياس النشاط العقلي من خلال تحليل النشاط الكهربائي في الدماغ، وتحليل لغوي للمقالات.\nوكانت المشاركة الذهنية لدى مستخدمي الذكاء الصناعي أقل بكثير مقارنة بالمجموعتين الأخريين. كما واجهوا صعوبة أكبر في تذكّر اقتباسات من مقالاتهم، وشعروا بارتباط أقل بكتابتها.\nالمثير للاهتمام أن المشاركين تبادلوا الأدوار في المقالة الرابعة: استخدم من بدأوا دون أدوات «تشات جي بي تي»، والعكس. فكانت النتيجة أن الذين انتقلوا من استخدام الذكاء الصناعي إلى الكتابة الذاتية، أدّوا أداءً أضعف، ما يشير إلى أنهم راكموا ما سمّاه الباحثون «دينًا معرفيًا»، أي تراجعًا في المهارات الذهنية بسبب الاعتماد على الذكاء الصناعي.\nومع ذلك، يشير الباحثون إلى أن نتائج المقالة الرابعة تبقى أولية، لأن 18 مشاركًا فقط أكملوها.\nيرى بعض الباحثين أن النتائج قد تكون بسبب تصميم الدراسة ذاته. فالمشاركون الذين كتبوا من دون الذكاء الصناعي على مدار ثلاث جلسات، أصبحوا أكثر اعتيادًا على المهمة، وهو ما يُعرف بـ«تأثير التأقلم».\nأما المجموعة التي استخدمت الذكاء الصناعي طوال الوقت، فلم تُتاح لها فرصة تطوير استراتيجيات عقلية بنفس الشكل، مما جعل أداءهم أضعف عند الانتقال المفاجئ إلى العمل الذهني المباشر.\nوبالعكس، كان أداء من استخدموا عقولهم أولًا ثم انتقلوا إلى الذكاء الصناعي أفضل، لأنهم استغلوا الذكاء الصناعي لتعزيز ما يعرفونه مسبقًا، لا ليقوم بالتفكير نيابة عنهم.\nالدروس من تجربة الآلة الحاسبة\nعند ظهور الآلات الحاسبة في السبعينيات، لم يُمنع استخدامها، بل رُفع مستوى الامتحانات، فصار على الطلاب استخدامها لحل مسائل أكثر تعقيدًا بدلًا من القيام بعمليات حسابية روتينية.\nلكن مع الذكاء الصناعي، لم يحدث الشيء ذاته. لا تزال المهام التعليمية كما كانت قبل خمس سنوات، مما يسمح للطلاب بتجنّب التفاعل النقدي الحقيقي والاعتماد على الذكاء الصناعي في أداء المهام، وهو ما يُنتج ما يسمى «الكسل المعرفي».\nومع ذلك، فإن الذكاء الصناعي يمكن ويجب أن يُستخدم بذكاء. مثلًا، يمكن للطلاب إعداد خطة درس تفصيلية بمساعدة الذكاء الصناعي، ثم تُقيّم من خلال امتحان شفوي لقياس عمق الفهم.\nالمهارات المستقبلية تتطلب التفكير النقدي والإبداع وحل المشكلات، وهي مفاهيم يعيد الذكاء الصناعي تعريفها. لم يعد إنتاج مقال بخط اليد معيارًا وحيدًا لقياس التفكير النقدي، كما لم يعد حل القسمة الطويلة دليلاً على المهارة الحسابية.\nالمفتاح هو تعلُّم متى وأين وكيف نستخدم الذكاء الصناعي، والتمييز بين المهام التي يمكن تفويضها إلى الذكاء الصناعي لتقليل العبء الذهني، وتلك التي تتطلب جهدًا عقليًا حقيقيًا. وهذا ما سيُحدد مستقبل التعلُّم الحقيقي في عصر الذكاء الصناعي.",

    "text": "El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional había puesto a Tucumán bajo alerta naranja por tormentas fuertes desde la medianoche a la mañana del viernes.\n“El área será afectada por lluvias y tormentas, algunas localmente fuertes o severas. Las mismas estarán acompañadas por abundante caída de agua, actividad eléctrica intensa, caída de granizo de diversos tamaños y ráfagas fuertes. Se prevén valores de precipitación acumulada entre 40 y 70 mm, pudiendo ser superados en forma puntual”, reza el informe.\nAgregó que las condiciones del tiempo mejorarán después del mediodía del viernes y que las temperaturas descenderán un poco el viernes, para el sábado empezar a subir nuevamente.\nLa tormenta que se anunció ayer llegó esta madrugada a Tucumán. Poco despues de las 05:00 y tras impactantes ráfagas de viento, las precipitaciones comenzaron en la zona de Capital y alrededores.\nUsuarios de diferentes barrios del Gran San Miguel de Tucumán y también del interior provincial reportan cortes de luz, calles anegadas y varios árboles caídos.\nCaso Cecilia Strzyzowski: autorizaron al Clan Sena a poder reunirse\nLa Empresa de Distribución Eléctrica de Tucumán (EDET) informó que el intenso temporal registrado en la madrugada de este viernes dejó a millas de usuarios sin suministro eléctrico en varias zonas de la provincia.\nLas áreas más afectadas son el centro, sur y este de Tucumán, incluyendo localidades como el Gran San Miguel de Tucumán, Simoca, Chicligasta, Monteros y Lules.\nSegún el comunicado de EDET, los cortes se deben a la caída de árboles, ramas y descargas atmosféricas que dañaron las líneas eléctricas.\nLas cuadrillas de la empresa trabajan intensamente para restablecer el servicio, priorizando las zonas más críticas.\nSin embargo, no se precisó un tiempo estimado para la normalización completa. Solicitan a los usuarios mantenerse informados a través de los canales oficiales y tomar precauciones ante posibles interrupciones prolongadas.",
