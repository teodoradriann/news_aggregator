    "text": "环境及气候\nBALI@ 2025.03.06 , 08:04\n0\n末日倒计时：超级大陆将引爆灭绝危机\n研究预测，约2.5亿年后，超级大陆形成带来的极端高温或将导致包括人类在内的哺乳动物大规模灭绝，堪比恐龙末日。\n人类总是忍不住去猜测世界末日究竟何时降临。从古至今，无数人试图为地球生命的终点定下日期，可惜都无功而返。如今，战争、饥荒、疾病、气候变化等威胁层出不穷，连“末日钟”都离午夜仅剩咫尺，似乎在提醒我们末日不远。然而，University of Bristol主导的一项2023年研究却给出了一个更具体的答案：大约2.5亿年后，地球上的生命可能因一场前所未有的高温浩劫走向终结。\n别急着恐慌，这离我们还很遥远。研究者们指出，这场灾难的导火索将是地球大陆的重新聚拢，形成一个名为Pangea Ultima的超级大陆。届时，极端气候将让哺乳动物——包括人类——几乎无处容身。这将是自恐龙灭绝以来，下一次大规模生命消亡。研究的第一作者Alexander Farnsworth在新闻发布会上解释：“新大陆的形成会带来三重打击：大陆效应、太阳升温以及大气中二氧化碳激增。这意味着地球大部分地区将变成一个没有食物和水源的炙热荒漠。”\n想象一下，气温普遍在40到50摄氏度之间，甚至日间极端值更高，再加上高湿度，人类和其他物种将无法通过出汗散热，最终走向灭亡。Farnsworth补充说：“这种环境对哺乳动物来说简直是致命的，我们的身体根本无法适应。”\n这张照片显示了地球最温暖的月平均温度(摄氏度)，以及2.5亿年后的超级大陆(终极盘古大陆)，届时几乎任何哺乳动物都难以生存。\n科学家们如何得出这个结论？他们借助超级计算机，首次模拟了未来气候模式，预测Pangea Ultima形成后的天气变化。他们分析了温度、风向、降雨和湿度的趋势，发现这个超级大陆将是一片干燥酷热的“无人区”。为了推算未来的二氧化碳浓度，团队还结合了板块运动、海洋化学和生物学模型。University of Leeds的Benjamin Mills教授负责这一部分的计算，他说：“现在大气二氧化碳浓度大约是400ppm，而未来可能攀升到600ppm以上——前提是人类不再燃烧化石燃料，否则这个数字会来得更快。”\n地球的麻烦还不止于此。随着时间推移，太阳会变得更亮，释放更多能量，进一步推高气温。同时，板块运动形成的超级大陆还会引发火山喷发，大量二氧化碳涌入大气，加剧全球变暖。如今，地球已频频刷新高温纪录，这一切似乎都在为未来的灾难埋下伏笔。\n当然，短时间内我们还不必太担心。研究表明，在Pangea Ultima形成之前，地球大部分地区应该还能维持宜居状态。可一旦超级大陆成形，适合哺乳动物生存的陆地面积将骤减到8%到16%之间。Alexander J. Farnsworth感叹：“即使一个星球位于所谓的‘宜居带’，如果大陆聚成一团，也未必适合人类生存。今天的大陆分布让我们受益匪浅，可未来未必如此。”\n这听起来像科幻电影的情节，但却是科学家们基于严谨模拟得出的警告。或许250百万年后，地球会变成一个陌生而残酷的世界，而我们能做的，也许是珍惜当下，延缓这场热浪的到来。\n本文译自 The Weather Network，由 BALI 编辑发布。\n赞一个 (0)",

    "text": "Hamas accused Israel on Thursday of committing the most heinous acts of mass genocide in hospitals across the Gaza Strip. \"Gaza hospitals have turned into war zones where the (Israeli) occupation is committing the worst acts of brutal genocide due to the Zionist killing machine,\" it said. \"The fascist Israeli army is escalating its horrific crimes in northern Gaza, imposing a siege on Kamal Adwan Hospital in the Beit Lahia area, targeting it along with the wounded, patients, medical teams, and hundreds of displaced families through heavy gunfire and artillery shelling.\" Earlier Thursday, Munir Al-Bursh, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, told Anadolu that \"patients and the injured are living in a state of terror due to the Israeli targeting of Kamal Adwan Hospital and its surroundings in northern Gaza, where the Israeli army has been committing acts of mass extermination for 20 days.\" Hamas called Israel's siege of hospitals a \"war crime\" and a violation of all laws and norms, accusing the \"fascist\" Israeli government of committing the crimes in full view of the world. Israeli ground incursions and bombardments, meanwhile, continue across northern Gaza as the army pushes to evacuate the area through forced displacement. The army has continued a devastating offensive on Gaza since an attack last year by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas, despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire. More than 42,800 people have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 100,500 others injured, according to local health authorities. The Israeli onslaught has displaced almost the territory's entire population amid an ongoing blockade that has led to severe shortages of food, clean water, and medicine. Israel faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in Gaza.",

The way the ground situation has changed in Jammu and Kashmir, the way the region is witnessing economic progress and the way peace has returned there, I think demands will emerge from people of PoK that they should merge with India\".\nSingh emphasised that India does not intend to use force to capture PoK, as he expects the people there to express a desire to be part of India.\nSingh also highlighted the significant improvement in the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir, suggesting that a time may come when the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) will no longer be necessary in the region.\nHowever, he clarified that decisions regarding AFSPA are under the jurisdiction of the Union Home Ministry.\nRegarding the ongoing conflict with Pakistan, Singh called for an end to Pakistan's support for cross-border terrorism, emphasising that India will not tolerate any attempts to destabilise the country.\nThe relationship between India and Pakistan has been strained, particularly since India's airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot, Pakistan, in response to the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019.\nTensions escalated further when India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and reorganized the state into two union territories in August 2019.\nIndia has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan but has emphasised that Pakistan must take steps to create a terrorism-free and friendly environment for such engagement.\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nSupport Swarajya's 50 Ground Reports Project & Sponsor A Story\nEvery general election Swarajya does a 50 ground reports project.\nAimed only at serious readers and those who appreciate the nuances of political undercurrents, the project provides a sense of India's electoral landscape.

(EUROPA PRESS) -\nAgentes Forestales de la Comunidad de Madrid han devuelto a su nido a un pollo de águila real herido cuyo nido se había desplomado hacía tiempo por la lluvia, ha informado este jueves en redes sociales Emergencias 112.\nEn aquel momento, la pequeña águila fue trasladada de inmediato al Centro de Recuperación de Animales Salvajes (CRAS Madrid Viñuelas) de la Comunidad de Madrid para recibir atención veterinaria.\nUna vez recuperado, el pollo ha sido colocado en las inmediaciones de su nido con la ayuda del Grupo de Intervención en Altura (GIAM) de los Forestales y el personal del CRAS, de Campestris Ruralis y del Proyecto Aequilibrium.\nDesde la altura, los agentes lo han estado observando para asegurarse de que los padres lo alimenten. Al confirmar que lo hacían, se retiraron de la zona, sabiendo que pronto le verán de nuevo surcar los cielos.\nINTERVENCIÓN DE POLICÍAS LOCALES Por otro lado, la Policía Municipal de Móstoles ha informado este jueves que fueron requeridos por personal de Parques y Jardines de Móstoles para recuperar una cría de autillo que se encontraba perdida y desorientada. Ha sido entregado al Grupo Brinzal de estudio, conservación y rehabilitación de rapaces nocturnas.\nDías, antes un ciudadano hizo entrega a los agentes locales de un águila anillada que se encontraba en el Parque Prado Ovejero y no podía volar. Entonces, realizaron los trámites necesarios y la entregamos a los empleados del Grupo de Rehabilitación de la Fauna Autóctona y su Hábitat (GREFA) para su cuidado y recuperación.",

    "text": "El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador informó que se realizará un despliegue permanente de alrededor de 10,000 elementos de la Guardia Nacional en Acapulco, Guerrero.\n“Ya se inició la construcción de instalaciones para la Guardia Nacional en todo Acapulco. Van a permanecer alrededor de diez mil elementos de la Guardia Nacional en Acapulco. Pero bueno, vamos a evaluar este programa”.\nEl anuncio del presidente se da en un contexto de creciente violencia en el puerto de Acapulco . Recientemente, el encargado de despacho de la Secretaría de Seguridad Pública local, Luis Enrique Vázquez Rodríguez, renunció a su cargo alegando una “invitación para participar en el área de seguridad y justicia del próximo Gobierno federal”.\nEn lo que va del presente año, Acapulco ha sido escenario de múltiples hechos violentos. A principios de mayo, se encontraron los cuerpos desmembrados de cuatro hombres afuera de la cárcel de Las Cruces. Este hallazgo sumó 16 personas asesinadas en aproximadamente 24 horas en distintos puntos de la ciudad.\nAnteriormente, en junio de 2023, el ex Secretario de Seguridad Pública de Acapulco, Maximiliano Serrano, fue detenido en Sinaloa por su presunta participación en la desaparición de dos marinos que formaban parte de su escolta cuando ocupaba el cargo.\nEl despliegue de 10,000 elementos de la Guardia Nacional en Acapulco de forma permanente representaría una medida sin precedentes para intentar contener los altos niveles de violencia que se registran en esa urbe guerrerense.\nCabe destacar que este tipo de operativos de seguridad con la Guardia Nacional ya se han implementado en otras entidades del País.\nPor ejemplo, en la Ciudad de México, la entonces Jefa de Gobierno, Claudia Sheinbaum, ordenó el despliegue de 6,060 elementos en el Sistema de Transporte Colectivo Metro, ante lo que calificó como “episodios fuera de lo normal” que atentaban contra la seguridad de los usuarios.\nSigue leyendo:\n– Hallan cuatro cuerpos desmembrados cerca de una prisión y un cuartel de Policía en Acapulco.\n– Otra masacre en Acapulco: Asesinan a 5 personas en ataque a un local de máquinas tragamonedas.",

    "title": "El 93% de las personas de la comunidad musulmana dice haber sufrido discriminación, según informe de Asociación Marroquí",
    "text": "MÁLAGA, 29 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa Asociación Marroquí para la Integración de los Inmigrantes ha llevado a cabo la investigación '¿Por qué no se denuncia la islamofobia en España?', elaborada a nivel nacional, de la que se extrae, entre otras conclusiones, que el 93% de las personas que pertenecen a la comunidad musulmana afirman haber sido víctimas de actitudes discriminatorias por motivos islamófobos, racistas y/o xenófobos.\nEsto supone, según han puesto de manifiesto desde la Asociación Marroquí a través de un comunicado, que \"solo siete de cada 100 personas pertenecientes a dicho colectivo sienten que no han sufrido discriminación por dichos motivos en España\".\nSe trata, han señalado, de un estudio \"pionero\" a nivel nacional cuyo objetivo es contabilizar, tanto cuantitativamente como cualitativamente, la situación de la discriminación por motivos islamófobos en el país.\nEn este estudio han participado 650 personas musulmanas o percibidas como tal de todas las comunidades y ciudades autónomas de España, 38 administraciones públicas y entidades sociales y 19 grupos focales, donde participaron personas que ya se percibían como víctimas de discursos de odio motivado por este asunto.\nLa investigación se ha elaborado en el marco del Programa Estatal de lucha contra la Infradenuncia en la discriminación islamófoba, financiado por el Ministerio de Derechos Sociales, Consumo y Agenda 2030 con cargo a la asignación tributaria del Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas y del Impuesto sobre Sociedades.\nSegún han afirmado desde la asociación, las conclusiones arrojan \"la necesidad de seguir facilitando herramientas para contestar a la islamofobia, ya que el alto porcentaje de personas que sufren discriminación se complementa con que sólo un 6,4% de las víctimas denuncia\".\n\"Es decir, el 93,6% de los casos de odio no se ponen en conocimiento de las autoridades competentes\", han incidido. En cuanto a las causas de la infradenuncia, en el informe se apunta que los motivos más comunes son \"que no sabían que podían denunciarlo, la falta de confianza en las instituciones y el temor a ser discriminado/a o no ser atendidos/as adecuadamente debido a su cultura y/o religión\".\nPor otro lado, en cuanto a la forma en la que se manifiestan estas agresiones, la investigación destaca que ocho de cada diez víctimas de islamofobia \"sufren comentarios, insultos y gestos ofensivos y/o alguna forma de ofensa e intolerancia por uso del hiyab, siendo estas una de las formas de discriminación de las más predominantes\".\nAsimismo, una de cada cuatro agresiones que sufre una mujer musulmana en España se produce como consecuencia del uso del hiyab, han indicado desde la Asociación Marroquí. Los lugares o contextos en donde más discriminación islamófoba se manifiesta son la calle o lugar público, el sitio de trabajo y el colegio o centro educativo.\nA través de esta investigación, han asegurado que también se ha podido cuantificar \"la necesidad de aumentar los recursos que protejan a las víctimas, ya que la discriminación por islamofobia no es un hecho aislado\". Al respecto, han apuntado que las víctimas \"suelen ser reiteradamente agredidas\".\nDe hecho, han indicado que \"nueve de cada diez personas que fueron encuestadas declararon haber sufrido algún tipo de discriminación y/o conducta de odio en más de una ocasión\". Asimismo, una de cada cuatro víctimas necesitó apoyo psicológico y emocional, recibiéndola solamente un 26% de las mismas, señala el estudio. El resto declaró en su mayoría no haberla recibido por falta de medios.\nDesde la Asociación Marroquí han concluido que \"se confirma que la discriminación por islamofobia, al igual que otras formas de odio, suele ser sutil y estar normalizada\". \"Esto explica el alto porcentaje de personas afectadas y el elevado índice de infradenuncia\", han manifestado.\nPor esto han insistido en la importancia de \"seguir visibilizando estos datos, de aumentar la sensibilización ciudadana y de trabajar desde la transversalidad para disminuir esta lacra\". Asimismo, han reiterado que \"es muy importante dar a conocer repetidamente que detrás de estas agresiones y comentarios se encuentran personas a las que se les está atacando su integridad moral y en ocasiones física\".\n\"Desde la entidad, consideramos que sigue existiendo un vacío estadístico en este campo, por lo que es necesario seguir trabajando la islamofobia también desde el campo de la investigación y el mundo académico\", han señalado en el comunicado, recordando que como asociación que lleva cinco años elaborando el Programa Nacional para la Prevención de la Islamofobia han recogido algunas recomendaciones \"para frenar el odio, que son útiles tanto para administraciones como para la sociedad en general\".\nMás información Inmigración Racismo",
