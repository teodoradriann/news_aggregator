    "text": "Ireland weather: Freezing temperatures for New Year’s weekend as rain warning issued for several counties\nNew Year’s weekend revellers will need to wrap up as temperatures are set to plummet below freezing during the night this weekend.\nSeveral counties are being hit with two Status Yellow rainfall warnings issued by Met Éireann bringing the possibility of “localised flooding.”\nMet Éireann has issued a Status Yellow rainfall warning for Donegal, Leitrim, north Mayo, and Sligo, from 6am this Friday morning, lasting until 9pm tonight.\nThe national forecaster has warned the affected counties to expect “heavy rainfall leading to localised flooding.”\nA Status Yellow gale warning from Belfast Lough to Strangford Lough to Howth Head and on the north Irish Sea also kicked in from 5.20am this morning.\nWesterly winds will reach gale force 8 or strong gale force 9, with a maximum speed of 88kph.\nA second Status Yellow gale warning came into effect from 5.30am this morning, which ranges from Slyne Head to Erris Head to Rossan Point. Gale force winds of force 8 (62-74kph) are expected.\nMet Éireann has also issued a Status Yellow rainfall warning for counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Wexford this Saturday, from 2am to midday.\nMeanwhile a Status Yellow gale force winds warning has been issued for the entire coast of Ireland from midnight on Saturday for 24 hours.\nIt will be windy at first this morning with fresh to strong and gusty westerly winds, gradually easing, while there will be sunny periods and some heavy showers for much of the country.\nHowever, showery rain will persist in parts of the north and northwest for much of the day with some localised flooding likely and a chance of a little sleet in the north too.\nHighest temperatures today of 4 to 8 degrees, possibly a little lower in some northern parts.\nTemperatures will then drop below freezing for the first time this weekend, starting tonight.\n“Lowest temperatures of -1 to +3 degrees with some frost and icy stretches forming with light to moderate southwesterly or variable breezes,” Met Éireann said.\nHowever, cloud will build from the southwest, turning milder as the rain follows, extending northeastwards over much of the country by morning, accompanied by fresh to strong and gusty southeasterly winds.\nThere is a chance of transient falls of sleet on the leading edge of the rain.\nA wet and windy start to the day on Saturday with widespread rain, heavy or thundery at times with some localised flooding possible.\nThe rain will clear from the west to sunny spells and showers from the western half of the country through the morning, extending to all areas in the afternoon.\nSome showers will be heavy with a chance of isolated thunderstorms and hail. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 9 degrees, coolest in the northwest.\nFresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest.\nSaturday night will bring clear spells and squally showers overnight, most frequent in the west and southwest. Lowest temperatures of 3 to 6 degrees.\nSunday will be breezy or windy with sunny spells and scattered showers and a chance of hail. Highest temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees generally.\nOn Sunday night, showers will continue, mainly for Atlantic counties with longer spells of rain possible in the northwest. Some frost or ice will form with lowest temperatures of -1 to +3 degrees in mostly moderate westerly winds.\nThis Monday, New Year's Day will see sunny spells and scattered showers at first, becoming more isolated through the morning and early afternoon.\nCloud will build from the southwest with rain following, extending northeastwards over much of the country by night-time. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees.\nOutbreaks of rain will clear northwards from most areas on Monday night, with clear spells and scattered showers following from the west.\nLowest temperatures over the northern half of the country of -2 to 0 degrees, which are expected to be milder further south.\n“Current indications suggest that there will be further showers or showery outbreaks of rain. Highest temperatures of 6 to 9 degrees generally,” Met Éireann said of Tuesday..\nMet Éireann said the first week of 2024 also looks likely to prove quite unsettled as a low-pressure weather front will bring blustery conditions with rainfall expected to be well above early January norms.\nThe good news is that calmer weather is expected from January 8 thanks to a high-pressure front arriving in the Atlantic, although there will still be some showers around.",

    "title": "Democrat slams 'pathetic' progress on EV charger installations | Fox Business",
    "text": "The Biden administration&apos;s efforts to install electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that received billions of dollars in funding from Congress have thus far yielded just seven functioning chargers, which Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., called \"pathetic\" progress on Wednesday.The seven charging stations consist of a few dozen total charging ports and were funded under a 2021 federal law , said Shailen Bhatt, who heads the Federal Highway Administration, at a Senate Environment and Public Works committee hearing.\"That is pathetic. We&apos;re now three years into this… That is a vast administrative failure,\" said Merkley. \"Something is terribly wrong, and it needs to be fixed.\"Merkley also criticized existing federal highway rules for preventing the installation of EV charging stations at rest stops. BIDEN ADMIN OFFICIAL SAYS HIGHER TARIFFS ON CHINESE EVS ARE CRUCIAL FOR US AUTOMAKERS The Biden administration's push to install EV chargers has yielded slow results so far. (Gregory Rec/Portland Press Herald via / Getty Images) Bhatt said he, too, is frustrated by the slow pace and acknowledged, \"There are a number of problems.\" Among those, he noted that states are dealing with multiple programs as they look to tap into funding for EV charger installations. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Tom Carper, D-Del., said he is considering holding a hearing on the slow deployment of EV charging stations.\"We want to make sure that the federal money that we have allocated is being used for the right purposes,\" Carper said. AMERICANS ARE STILL NOT SOLD ON EVS DESPITE BIDEN PUSH, POLL SHOWS Car buyers have expressed apprehension at buying EVs because of the lack of public charging stations. ( / Getty Images) The latest criticism of the EV charging station rollout comes after Republican lawmakers in February raised concerns about the EV program and said at the time that \"little progress has been made.\"The Biden administration has set a goal of increasing the size of the charging network to 500,000 ports, including high-speed chargers, that are located no more than 50 miles apart on the busiest highways in the country.Bhatt said the U.S. had a total of about 183,000 public charging stations as of December and that the number of fast-charging ports available to the public has grown by 90% since the start of the Biden administration. He also expressed confidence the U.S. will reach the 500,000 charging port goal. MANY CONSUMERS STAYING AWAY FROM EVS DUE TO LACK OF CHARGING AVAILABILITY: REPORT Members of Congress have criticized the slow rollout of federally funded EV charging stations. (Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via / Getty Images) Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday that 27 states have issued commercial requests to build charging stations and that she expects about 1,000 EV-charging stations in public places to be operational by the end of 2024.\"These are the hardest ones to do,\" Granholm said, adding that some areas slated for charging stations don&apos;t have electricity yet. A recent study by J.D. Power found that car shoppers are slightly less likely to consider purchasing an EV than they were a year ago, with the lack of charging station availability the leading reason, with 52% of respondents citing that as the reason they&apos;re less interested in EVs.That figure is up 3 percentage points from a year ago, which J.D. Power suggested may be \"a sign that concerns about public charging infrastructure are only getting worse.\" Reuters contributed to this report.",
