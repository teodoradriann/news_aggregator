    "text": "Atlanta Braves ace Spencer Strider is already one of the best pitchers in MLB.\nHe didn’t have the lowest ERA in 2023, at 3.86, but no one misses bats quite like him among starters.\nHe punched out 281 hitters last year, in 186.2 innings.\nThe ace throws a fastball which is his bread and butter, and his slider is his best secondary offering.\nHe also throws a changeup, but only about seven percent of the time.\nBetween his sometimes spotty command and the fact he throws mainly two pitches, he can be prone to home runs, or at least was in 2023.\nHe has seemingly been working hard to add a fourth offering to keep hitters honest: a curveball.\nIt’s looking good.\n“Nice looking new curveball from Spencer Strider, looks like he can command it well too. 3-2 count,” writer and researcher Eno Sarris tweeted.\nNice looking new curveball from Spencer Strider, looks like he can command it well too. 3-2 count.\n[pic.twitter.com/AjJOOFgCKp]\n— Eno Sarris (@enosarris)\n[February 29, 2024]\nIt’s not your average 12-6 curveball, though: it also has significant glove-side break.\nIt looked like a fastball outside but its two-plane break brought it back to the zone, which earned him a strikeout looking.\nThis could definitely become another part of his regular arsenal as long as he has confidence in the pitch.\nHe had it on Thursday, in a spring training game.\nHowever, it remains to be seen if he will be willing to use it in any count and in any situation when the games that count start.\nIn any case, it’s always nice to see an elite performer work even harder on his craft, which is what happened here.\nStrider, if healthy, could be primed for a career year in 2024.\nNEXT: Video Shows A Positive Sign From Chris Sale",

    "text": "Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries surged in February by the most since June 2021, with Canada and Japan among the biggest net buyers during a month that preceded the bond market’s recent turmoil.\nTotal overseas holdings of Treasury securities jumped by US$290 billion to a record $8.82 trillion in February, Treasury Department figures showed Wednesday. Foreign buyers purchased a net $106.2 billion of long-term, and $73.2 billion of short-term, Treasuries in the month.\nCanada, which had mounted net sales of Treasuries in January, more than made up for those in February, with net purchases of $46.5 billion in long-term Treasuries, the data showed. Some market observers had noted the January transactions came alongside pressure by President Donald Trump on the U.S. northern neighbor. Tensions have since escalated further.\nJapan’s holdings, the largest overseas stockpile, climbed by $46.6 billion in February — the most since February 2020. Standing at $1.13 trillion, holdings are at the highest level since April 2024.\nChina’s Treasuries holdings also climbed, by $23.5 billion to $784.3 billion. The nation sold a net $4.8 billion of longer-term U.S. government securities, but added a net $15.1 billion of short-term Treasuries. The overall gain also reflects a boost in valuations, as Treasuries climbed in February. China is the second-largest overseas holder of Treasuries, and has recently been the subject of speculation with regard to the potential for retaliatory sales in the face of Trump’s steep tariff hikes.\nThe UK, the third-largest foreign holder, saw its stockpile go up by $10.1 billion, to $750.3 billion. Belgium, whose holdings include Chinese custodial accounts according to market analysts, held $394.7 billion of Treasuries in February, up $17 billion from the previous month. Belgium saw net sales of both long-term and short-term Treasuries, adding up to less than $1 billion for the month.\nThe latest breakdown of holders illustrates the foreign appetite for U.S. debt about a month before the brunt of Trump’s expansive tariffs. In the wake of his April 2 announcement, the $29 trillion Treasuries market suffered the worst rout since 2001.\nData in coming months will be scrutinized for any signs that foreign nations are reducing their Treasury holdings outright. While the figures for foreign holdings for April won’t be due out until June, some market participants expressed skepticism over that narrative. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier this week said she wouldn’t expect China to engage in such action.\nOver a longer-term perspective, foreign investors’ role in the Treasuries market has diminished relative to the peak reached in 2008, when they accounted for over half of the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In recent months, the ratio has been about 30 per cent.\nHoldings of the Cayman Islands — viewed as a popular domicile for leveraged investors such as hedge funds, — went up by $13.3 billion, to $417.8 billion. Market participants have said the recent volatility in the Treasuries market has been in part related to hedge funds unwinding a strategy known as the basis trade.\nWednesday’s figures also showed that United Arab Emirates’ holdings of Treasuries soared nearly $43 billion in the first two months of this year, and now stand at $119.9 billion — roughly double where they were in January last year.\nChristopher Anstey, Bloomberg News\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Thirty-four seasons later, welcome back to longtime readers and welcome aboard to newbies. We like to have fun here but take our picks seriously, and we’re determined to bounce back big and get back on the right side of .500 against the Evil Betting Line after last year’s narrow miss.

    "text": "4月16日下午，国家主席习近平同马来西亚总理安瓦尔在布特拉加亚总理官邸举行会谈。\n　　习近平乘车抵达总理官邸时，安瓦尔热情迎接。马来西亚青少年挥舞两国国旗，奏响欢快的鼓乐，跳起热情的民族舞蹈，热烈欢迎远道而来的贵宾。\n　　习近平指出，中马传统友谊跨越千年。两国友好在悠久历史中孕育，在文化交融中生长，在互惠互利中巩固，在风雨同舟中升华，展现了以心相交、以诚相待、以义为持、以和为贵的共同价值追求，体现出两国人民的历史智慧和勇气，是两国共同的宝贵财富。去年，双方隆重庆祝建交50周年。过去50年中马关系结出丰硕成果，双方要在下一个50年继续把握历史主动，勇立时代潮头，构建高水平战略性中马命运共同体，为两国人民创造更多福祉，为地区繁荣稳定作出更大贡献。\n　　习近平就建设高水平战略性中马命运共同体提出三点意见。\n　　一是坚持战略自主，开展高水平战略协作。中马两国都坚持自立自强，反对外部干涉，要继续携手走好符合本国国情的发展道路，坚定支持彼此维护国家主权、安全、发展利益，把前途命运牢牢掌握在自己手中。建立外交、国防“2+2”对话机制，深化国家安全、防务、执法交流合作。\n　　二是凝聚发展合力，打造高质量发展合作标杆。中国致力于以高质量发展全面推进中国式现代化，同马来西亚“昌明经济”计划异曲同工。双方要携手培育壮大数字经济、绿色经济、蓝色经济、人工智能等前沿合作，加强产业链、供应链、价值链、数据链、人才链融合发展。推动传统领域合作转型升级，促进双向投资。推进铁海联运，实现“两国双园”提质升级，将马来西亚重要港口打造成“陆海新通道”重要枢纽。\n　　三是传承世代友好，深化文明交流互鉴。开展“儒伊文明对话”合作，携手打造两国乃至地区层面文明交流平台。以签署互免签证协定为契机，大力开展旅游、青年、地方交流，深化文化、教育、体育、电影、传媒等合作，促进民心相通，赓续传统友谊。中方愿同马方继续开展好大熊猫保护合作研究。\n　　习近平指出，马方将今年东盟的主题定为“包容性和可持续性”，体现了对时局的深刻洞察。中方支持马来西亚发挥东盟轮值主席国作用，愿同地区国家一道，尽早签署中国－东盟自由贸易区升级议定书， 以开放包容、团结合作 抵制 “ 脱钩 断链”、“小院高墙”和滥征 关税 ，以和平、合作、开放、包容的亚洲价值观回应弱肉强食的丛林法则，以亚洲的稳定性和确定性应对世界的不稳定和不确定。\n　　安瓦尔热烈欢迎习近平主席到访马来西亚，表示长期以来中国真诚帮助马来西亚，安危与共、患难与共，是马来西亚值得信赖的朋友。习近平主席领导中国取得伟大发展成就，带领中国人民摆脱贫困，倡导共同繁荣、文明互鉴，是当今世界的卓越领导人。马来西亚人民敬佩中国和习近平主席。习近平主席此访取得的创纪录合作成果，对马方意义重大，马方深受鼓舞。马方坚定奉行一个中国政策，不支持任何“台独”行径。马方愿同中方深化战略沟通，巩固政治互信；扩大两国贸易，欢迎中国企业赴马投资兴业，与马方发展数字经济、绿色经济、人工智能等新兴技术领域合作，助力两国实现更大发展；增进文化、教育、旅游等人文领域交流，促进人民相知相亲；开展伊斯兰文明和儒家文明对话，促进人类文明进步。面对单边主义抬头，马方愿同中方加强合作，共同应对风险挑战。东盟不会赞同任何单方面施加关税的做法，将通过合作联合自强，保持经济增长。马方高度赞赏中国在国际地区问题上发挥的积极作用。马来西亚作为东盟轮值主席国和东盟－中国关系协调国，将推动加强东盟－中国合作，促进地区和平稳定繁荣。\n　　会谈后，两国领导人共同见证中马双方交换30多份双边合作文本，涵盖三大全球倡议合作、“儒伊文明对话”、数字经济、服务贸易、“两国双园”升级发展、联合实验室、人工智能、铁路、知识产权、农产品输华、互免签证、大熊猫保护等领域。\n　　双方发表《中华人民共和国和马来西亚关于构建高水平战略性中马命运共同体的联合声明》。\n　　当晚，安瓦尔为习近平举行欢迎宴会。\n　　蔡奇、王毅、王小洪等参加上述活动。",
