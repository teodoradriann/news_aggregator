    "text": "Interdites à la vente , les huîtres de Christian Galinier vont retourner à la mer pendant 28 jours. Elles seront de nouveau propres à la consommation lorsqu’elles auront filtré l’eau polluée. \" On perd un tiers de notre chiffre d’affaires \", explique l’ostréiculteur, indiquant qu’il doit aussi aller chercher tous les coquillages qui ont été expédiés la semaine précédente.\nPlusieurs intoxications alimentaires C’est la présence d’un norovirus dans les coquillages, une bactérie d’origine humaine, qui provoque vomissements et diarrhées. Après plusieurs cas de gastro-entérites, la préfecture a décidé d’interdire la vente des huîtres du bassin d’Arcachon. 280 ostréiculteurs sont concernés.\nEn pleine période des fêtes, les professionnels pointent du doigt le réseau d’assainissement. Selon Olivier Laban, président du Comité régional de la conchyliculture Arcachon Aquitaine, c’est à cause de ce réseau que le virus a été transporté. \" Qui va payer l’addition aujourd’hui ?\" demande-t-il. Pour les gestionnaires du réseau en question, ce sont les fortes pluies tombées en novembre qui, chargées de bactéries, ont contaminé les huîtres du bassin.",

    "title": "Amazon faces Indian court scrutiny for labour conditions at warehouse",
    "text": "Workers detail stories of an unsafe work environment and unreasonable targets at a major warehouse; An Indian state has taken the retail giant to court. Amazon is facing prosecution in an Indian court for labour law violations at a major warehouse near the country’s national capital of Delhi. Documents reviewed by Al Jazeera through India’s Right to Information Act and court records showed that a labour inspection earlier this year alleged inadequate safety equipment, and failure to comply with provisions of labour laws at the Amazon warehouse. That inspection was launched after reports emerged of an incident in May, where Amazon workers at the facility, located near Manesar in the state of Haryana, were asked to take verbal pledges not to take breaks, including for drinking water or using the toilet, until they met their targets for the day. Amazon calls its warehouses “fulfilment centres”. An internal investigation by the company confirmed that a manager requested such a pledge as part of a “motivational exercise”. Amazon called the incident “unfortunate and isolated” in a letter to India’s Ministry of Labour and Employment in June, stating that disciplinary action had been taken against the manager. Amazon has not specified what action was taken against the executive. That same month, the local Haryana government conducted a “detailed investigation” through labour inspections at the Amazon warehouse. ‘Labour law violations’ The labour inspection report, reviewed by Al Jazeera through the Right to Information Act, concluded that “labour laws are not being followed by the organisation”. Amazon failed to provide workers with the required safety gear and did not maintain proper records, as required by law, at its warehouse. “Tight-fitting clothes are not provided to the female workers on or near the moving machinery,” according to an observation made in the labour inspection report. It is not clear whether safe clothes are provided to male workers. Working while wearing loose clothing near moving machinery is viewed as a potential occupational safety hazard as it could lead to injuries if clothes get entangled in the machine. Under India’s labour law regulations, workers need to wear tight-fitting clothes while working near moving machinery. The labour inspection report accused Amazon of not providing employment identity cards to its warehouse workers near Manesar. The Haryana government took Amazon to a court in the Delhi suburb of Gurugram in June, where it submitted the labour inspection report as evidence to back its case. The judge, Amit Gautam, in an order on July 6, summoned Amazon to be present before the court on October 28. However, the case was adjourned, with the next hearing now slated for December 10. “We haven’t been provided a copy of the Labour Office’s inspection report and hence cannot comment on it. Also, the matter is now sub-judice, so we cannot comment on other attributes of the Court filings noted in your inquiry,” an Amazon spokesperson told Al Jazeera in an email response to detailed questions on the allegations spelled out in the Haryana government’s labour investigation. Amazon employs 1.5 million workers globally, including [more than 100,000 people in India](/economy/2022/2/21/amazon-and-indias-reliance-get-set-for-next-battle-ipl-rights), from blue-collar workers deployed for warehouse packaging and delivery drivers to executives managing sales and marketing and AI specialists working on Amazon’s cloud computing firm, Amazon Web Services. At the Manesar warehouse, which helps Amazon deliver products to the national capital region of the country, there are more than 1,800 associates – a term the e-commerce company uses for its warehouse workers. Amazon’s warehouse associates play a crucial role in processing and preparing the company’s online deliveries. Some workers receive, check and sort the delivery products, while others pick, pack and ship the customer orders, while relocating products within the warehouse and loading trucks. Amazon has more than 60 such fulfilment centres across India. In recent years, Amazon’s [treatment of workers](/economy/2022/8/2/at-south-korean-amazon-workers-seek-relief-from-boiling-pot) has come under increased scrutiny, especially in the West, including the United Kingdom and [the United States](/economy/2022/10/17/amazon-faces-off-with-union-in-fight-for-a-second-warehouse). ‘Stiff work targets’ But while the company won’t comment, Al Jazeera spoke to three workers in different departments at the Manesar warehouse, who painted a picture of an exploitative environment very different from the one that Amazon portrays in its description of these facilities as ‘fulfilment centres’. They spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of retribution from the company for speaking with a journalist. A major complaint related to strict targets given to them at work. Another common complaint was about a lack of opportunities for workers to rest during the day, at the warehouse. “In one hour, I have to process 60 items that are return products that come back to Amazon. So, for one product, within a minute, I have to open the box, check the item for damage, review the customer’s comment and verify if it’s sellable or not,” said Prakash*, who has worked at the warehouse for almost five years. He spoke on condition of anonymity, afraid of being sacked for speaking to a journalist. “The targets are so tough to meet.” Amazon told India’s Labour and Employment Ministry in a letter in June that it is “confident” the targets given to its warehouse workers are “comfortably achievable”, and that the company has “sufficient headroom in capacity”, which is expanded whenever necessary. Al Jazeera reviewed a copy of the detailed response that Amazon sent to India’s Labour and Employment Ministry on June 24 this year on the government’s allegations of “certain workplace practices” at its Manesar warehouse. The complaint related to hourly working targets assigned to workers was also taken up by the Haryana government’s labour inspection team. The inspection report found no written agreement between workers and the Amazon warehouse management, while workers told Al Jazeera that the targets were set verbally. “There’s nothing more important to us than the safety and wellbeing of our employees and associates, and we comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Our facilities are industry-leading and provide competitive pay, comfortable working conditions, and specially designed infrastructure to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email statement to Al Jazeera. Monitoring of work Amazon’s workers clock in a total of 10 hours at the Manesar warehouse. That includes two 30-minute breaks. However, their work requires them to stand for the rest of the nine hours. “We have to do all the tasks assigned to us on our feet. We are not allowed to even sit,” Supriya*, who works at the inbound department of the warehouse, said. Workers in the inbound department handle products that arrive in the warehouse from manufacturers and sellers. Workers unload products and help in organising and storing them. Supriya said that the two 30-minute work breaks are insufficient. “We do have a canteen to go and rest, but the break of 30 minutes is too short for us to use the toilet, access our lockers, stand in the queue of the cafeteria, rest properly and come back to our workstation, all within that time window. There is no separate place to rest as well,” she said. Amazon also acknowledged in its response to India’s Labour and Employment Ministry that it offers no other place for the workers to rest or sit other than the cafeteria. “Our cafeterias are air-conditioned, comfortable and have adequate seating arrangement,” Amazon said in the June 24 letter to the Indian government. In addition to the two 30-minute breaks, Amazon said that workers are “free to [and] regularly take informal breaks”. Amazon told the Indian government that the company is evaluating whether it can arrange for additional seating arrangements through cafeterias at the warehouse. But Supriya disputed Amazon’s claim that workers frequently take informal breaks. They simply can’t afford to, she said. Supriya said she is often given a target of stowing 150 items per hour in the warehouse inventories, which she finds demanding. She complained of being heavily monitored at work. That makes it even harder to take breaks. Supriya explained that if she takes rest during the nine hours she is supposed to be working, the system logs it as “idle time”. Both Supriya and Prakash said that if workers are falling behind in meeting their hourly targets, including through “high” idle time, they may be handed over a “negative ADAPT”. To review employee performance, Amazon is known to have been using a tracking software known as ADAPT, which stands for Associate Development and Performance Tracker (ADAPT) at its warehouses, including in other parts of the world as well, like the US and the UK. Supriya and Prakash said that if workers receive three negative ADAPT within a period of 22 days, they are blacklisted from working at any of Amazon’s warehouses. Al Jazeera reviewed a copy of a negative ADAPT given to one of its workers at its Manesar warehouse. The written ADAPT notice asks the worker to sign an acknowledgement saying how their performance has not met expectations and that failure to improve may lead to termination of employment. “People join Amazon with the aspirations of working at a multinational company. But the reality is that workers often report high pressure to meet unrealistic targets,” Nitesh Kumar Das, an organiser at Amazon India Workers Association (AIWA), said. “Based on our ongoing engagement with Amazon warehouse workers, it is clear that there are persistent issues regarding working conditions across Amazon’s facilities in India.” Earlier this year, AIWA in collaboration with UNI Global Union, a global [trade union](/economy/2022/1/27/amazon-illegally-threatened-staff-union-board-alleges) for services sector workers, conducted a survey of more than 1,800 drivers and warehouse workers at Amazon’s India facilities. The survey revealed that more than 80 percent of warehouse workers found the targets set by the company for their work difficult to achieve. Amazon termed the AIWA survey as “factually incorrect, unsubstantiated”, and in contradiction to the feedback it gets from its own employees. “The data being quoted appears at best questionable, and at worst deliberately designed to deliver on a specific narrative that certain groups are trying to claim as fact,” Amazon said in its statement to Al Jazeera. While not specifically mentioning the ADAPT system, Amazon said that the company has performance expectations for its employees and it measures actual performance against those expectations. “When setting those targets, we take into account time in role, experience and the safety and well-being of our employees. We support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve,” Amazon said. But the practice of firing workers on receiving ‘three productivity flags’ has been acknowledged by the company’s executives in the UK. In January this year, French regulator CNIL had fined Amazon over $34m for “implementing an excessively intrusive system for monitoring employee activity and performance”. Amazon has appealed against the decision, terming it factually inaccurate. Back at the Manesar warehouse, Supriya says she wants to be treated with dignity at work. The ADAPT system, she said, needs to be abolished so that she and her colleagues do not feel constantly monitored at work. “We are working relentlessly to ensure that deliveries are on time,” Tirvan*, another associate who has been working at the Manesar warehouse for more than two years, said. “And all this time, the biggest worry for us at the end of the day is whether we are meeting our targets or not … This feeling should go.” *Names changed to protect the identity of workers who fear retribution for speaking to the media",

    "title": "The bird mothers keeping a species extant",
    "text": "The bird mothers keeping a species extant\nNikhila Purohit cares for eight Great Indian Bustard chicks at a breeding centre in Jaisalmer, part of efforts to save the critically endangered species.\nAt 7am, Nikhila Purohit, 29, dons her bright blue apron and makes her way outside to meet her children. She has eight, and like most young ones, they are always hungry, so they are happy to see her (as most children are to see their mother). But Purohit’s children are special, and not just in her eyes -- they account for almost 4% of the numbers of their species, perhaps more.\nPurohit is the surrogate mother to eight Great Indian Bustard (GIB) chicks that are being raised at a special enclosure in Ramdevra near Jaisalmer. They are part of 45 of the critically endangered species of varying age (they hatched at various times since 2019) being raised in other similar enclosures in the centre. There are less than 150 of the species in the wild -- some experts believe the number is already below 100 -- with almost all being found in a limited habitat in Jaisalmer, and the breeding centre’s goal is simple: to ensure captive breeding, and, at some point in time in the future, release the captive-bred GIBs into the wild.\nPurohit’s eight wards are special because they are among the 15 that have hatched in the past two years, from birds that were bred in the centre (the original batch of birds were hatched from 30 eggs collected in the wild). She isn’t alone; there are 13 other mothers (including eight men), all volunteers, and all working under the aegis of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to ensure the species does not vanish in the wild.\nThe population of the GIB has seen a sharp decline. Once found in parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the numbers have seen a plunge; habitat loss, and threats posed by predators and (in Jaisalmer) by overhead electricity transmission lines carrying power from solar projects are the main causes for the decline.\nCovered from all sides, the enclosures are a safe space for the species. Carrying a red feeder which has alfalfa (a flowering grass), mustard seeds, live crickets and mealworms, Purohit feeds the birds , as she will every 30 minutes through her shift of seven hours (which is broken into two parts). She is also tasked with observing their feeding patterns and behaviour.\n“They are excited to see us every morning. It is because they know they are getting food, but also that their mother is back. They have not seen the outside world so they are dependent on us. At the same time there are no natural threats, so they feel safe and have been breeding successfully,” says Purohit who has degrees in zoology and biodiversity.\nEach of the birds has its own name, with coloured rings to help caretakers identify them. Like most mothers, Purohit can identify them by appearance and mannerisms alone. “They have distinct personalities. Some are extroverted, whereas others prefer to stay in a corner,” she explains, while feeding them with a tweezer, which replicates a mother bustard’s beak.\nFrom 7am to 11am, Purohit spends the first half of the day with the birds, feeding and observing them; she comes back at 4pm for another three-hour shift.\nDwindling numbersEight may seem like an insignificant number, but it is more than one. Which is the number of eggs GIBs usually lay every year. They nest on open ground, leaving these eggs often vulnerable to predators, including feral dogs, which have emerged the most significant hazard to wildlife across India.\nIn recent years, cases of electrocution deaths have shot up too – owing to a labyrinth of high-tension wires now covering large parts of Jaisalmer as both wind and solar projects come up. The state bird of Rajasthan, also called Godawan, has found the going tough. A 2018 census, the latest for the species, pegged its population to be just 128 in the state. In comparison, the count was 745 in 1978, 600 in 2001 and 300 in 2008, data showed.\nHarish Ram, 25, is another surrogate mother. A resident of Jaisalmer’s Sam, he joined the WII centre in 2020 as sanitation staff. “I loved spending time with the birds. Even when I would be sweeping inside, I would try to play with them and the senior staff noticed my interest in them. They asked me to join the keeping team instead and that same year, I was trained to be a surrogate mother,” he says, adding that, as a local, he is aware of the importance of the species and what protecting it means.\nRam said while the blue aprons are what the birds have seen since their birth, they also recognise faces. “The idea was that even as surrogate mothers work in different shifts, the birds are able to identify us based on the blue apron. But they also recognise faces.”\nJog Singh, 34, is another surrogate mother. Singh, also from Sam, which is famous for its dunes, is an old-timer who has been at the centre since 2018; he has seen the process of the eggs being collected in the wild and being incubated. “I have raised them as my own children. Godawan is a special bird for Rajasthan,” he says, adding that he derives personal satisfaction , like every mother should, from feeding them and watching them grow.\nNear his village and in other parts of Jaisalmer, Singh has seen multiple GIBs perish from electrocution.\nThe 2018 census by WII also revealed that at least 18 birds died from electrocution. Locals have long been calling for their removal, but in 2024, the Supreme Court reduced the area in the region where the overhead wires were not allowed, citing the need to balance the need to conserve GIBs, with that to generate green power.\nPower playThough WII has two centres in Jaisalmer – the breeding centre at Ramdevra near Pokhran and an incubation centre in Sam -- there are still habitats for the bird in the wild. Rasla, a village 50km southeast of Jaisalmer city is part of a habitat where the bird once thrived. Now, frequent bird deaths are a common sight. After a GIB death in September 2020 barely a few hundred metres from the village, local residents decided to build a statue dedicated to the vanishing species, hoping to appeal to the conscience of the powers that be.\n“To this date, we still see bustards in our area. However, it is worrying too, since there are close to 14 high-tension power lines in this area which is also called Deghrai oran (sacred grove forest). In recent months, I have seen other birds die as well, including demoiselle cranes,” said Sumer Singh Bhati.\nBhati is a leading voice for the village of Rasla, which has been organising various local-level protests, seeking the shifting of power lines. “Last year, two of these lines were moved underground. This was after eight years of efforts. However, 14 power lines are still above ground and until that is fixed, this habitat is a landmine for GIBs,” he said.\nPower project developers cite the high cost of moving wires underground.\nThe GIB is among the heaviest birds in the world that are able to fly, with the adult male typically weighing 10 to 12kg. The average flying height is usually between five and 15 metres, going up to 60 metres for long-distance flights. High-tension wires typically stand at heights of 20 metres, putting the birds at risk.\nWhile Rasla is a disturbed habitat, around 100km towards Ramdevra is a relatively undisturbed patch – one where the bustards are frequently spotted between the villages of Dholiya and Tekholai.\nDholiya resident and local conservationist Radheshyam Bishnoi, 28, who has been fighting for protection of the bird for nearly a decade , says vested interests are making the fight difficult. “People in villages across Jaisalmer have sold their land to companies to set up solar and wind farms. The number of power lines is only increasing and that makes the bird’s survival difficult,” Bishnoi says, pointing to a group of three godawans in the wild. The stretch of land near his village is among the areas these cables have not yet reached. Protectors like him also have to keep feral dogs and wild pigs at bay. “There are several villagers who act as guardians for the bird. We even captured feral dogs and moved them away from the area,” he adds.\nThe other prominent habitat where the bird exists in the wild presently is the Desert National Park (DNP), a protected sanctuary where the forest department has created multiple enclosures using a predator proof fencing (PPF) to provide safe havens for the bird.\nBattle for survivalEven as questions remain over the quality of habitat outside, efforts at WII’s breeding centre mean the species may not become extinct -- at least not anytime soon. Dr Sutirtha Dutta, the lead scientist for the WII’s project is shifting gears to the next phase – the construction of a large dome-shaped tunnel which will allow all subsequent newborns to be trained to return to the wild.\n“Typically, after three to four years, the adults can breed and so from 2023, under stable conditions which includes food security, no predatory threats or any stress, there has been successful mating and 14 birds hatched this way. For the last bird, we even tried artificial insemination, with the adult ejaculating in a dummy resembling a female bird. Even that proved to be successful and that means there is a population of 45 birds here that can be our breeding population going forward,” explains Dutta, adding that while these birds are solely reliant on human beings, the aim is to ensure the next generation has no human contact.\n“In order for them to survive in the wild, they will have to feed on their own. For this, a rewilding aviary is being created, where the newly hatched birds will be kept for a period between three and nine months. While we will drop food such as grasshoppers there, they will not see any humans and thus it will be an environment closer to the wild,” says Dutta, stating this aviary, being developed by Rajasthan Government, will be at least 150 metres long, at least 50 metres wide and have a height of at least 10 metres. “This will allow the young birds to move freely and even take small flights from one spot to another,” he says. The plan is to eventually release these newly hatched birds post acclimisation into the wild by next year. Potential sites for releasing birds are the DNP and the Pokhran area, he says, adding that the next step includes scientifically informed habitat restoration.\nThe way forward The bustard recovery programme was announced in 2013 by the Union environment ministry and was ultimately launched in 2016. Breeding efforts began in 2019. To add impetus to this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the seventh meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) on March 3, announcing a National Great Indian Bustard Conservation Action Plan.\nExperts say that while captive breeding of the critically endangered species is a good move, the focus on habitat restoration has been missing.\n“There are two types of conservation – in-situ which is in the wild and the habitat that you are protecting. This is the most important type of conservation as it not only protects the species in the wild, but its habitat too. The other is ex-situ conservation, which is protecting the species outside of its natural habitat and that is what we have been doing. Here, in-situ has almost been forgotten,” says and former bureaucrat MK Ranjitsinh, who has worked extensively on protection of the species and was one of the petitioners in a 2019 public interest litigation in the Supreme Court seeking protection for the bird from power lines.\nWildlife biologist, Sumit Dookia, who has been working on the species since 2006 says a key component of protecting the species is habitat restoration. “What was required was to equally protect and improve the natural habitat outside. This needed to be done simultaneously so that if there are rewilding plans, there is safe and protected habitat outside. So far, it appears there are limited safe habitats outside.”",

    "text": "Gaza’s Health Ministry said Thursday that Israeli forces killed another 39 Palestinians and wounded 86 in the previous 24-hour period.\nThe latest violence brings the ministry’s death toll since October 7, 2023, to 41,534 and the number of wounded to 96,092. The toll is an undercount since it doesn’t include the estimated 10,000 people who are missing and presumed dead under the rubble.\n“There are still a number of victims under the rubble and on the streets, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them,” the ministry said on Telegram.\nPalestinians inspect the site of an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip on September 26, 2024. REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa Israeli strikes on Thursday included the bombing of another school-turned-shelter in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza . Al Jazeera reported that the strike on the Hafsa al-Faluja school killed at least 15 people.\nGaza’s Civil Defense said the dead in the school strike included women and children . Israel took credit for the strike and claimed it targeted a Hamas “command and control center” but offered no evidence.\nSchools sheltering displaced have become frequent targets of Israeli bombs in recent months. On September 21, Israel targeted a school in the al-Zeitoun neighborhood in Gaza City, killing at least 22 people, including 13 children and six women.\nLast week, Gaza’s Health Ministry released the names of 34,344 Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli forces, including 11,355 children. Among the children were 710 infants who did not make it to their first birthday.\nThe Biden administration continues to support the genocidal slaughter in Gaza by providing weapons to the Israeli military. Israel’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that it secured $8.7 billion in fresh military aid from the US.",

    "text": "‘Exciting time’ to be a family lawyer in 2024 Family lawyers will work in a bit of a “grey area” until significant legislative reforms come into effect in mid-2024, but when they do, it will be a “really exciting time”, one practitioner predicts. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2023 and Family Law Amendment (Information Sharing) Bill 2023 will bring about the “biggest reforms” in the space in close to two decades, [Barry Nilsson principal Genevieve Morgan said on an episode of The Lawyers Weekly Show](https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/podcast/38606-unpacking-the-passage-of-the-family-law-amendment-bill). To continue reading the rest of this article, please log in. Create free account to get unlimited news articles and more! In the episode, Ms Morgan explained the amendments – first proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in an April 2019 report – will not only remove a “bad law” but will also give the court even greater discretion on how to deal with parenting arrangements. This has been a “long time coming”, Ms Morgan said. “It’s good to see some of these reports that have been sitting in the bottom drawer actually being implemented by the government, and these amendments being passed should help families navigate the system, should make it simpler, should make it more straightforward.” Ms Morgan said the amendments will not only help clients navigate the complex family law system but will also be a major advantage to lawyers. “It’s a really exciting time to be a family lawyer. “[The changes are] all really good, and it makes me proud to be a family lawyer, to be able to work in a system that people can navigate more easily than they had previously,” Ms Morgan said. While the first half of 2024 will be a bit of a “grey area” for practitioners, Ms Morgan said lawyers will need to use this period to educate themselves on the changes – including reading the legislation amendments in detail and [examining what it will mean for them](https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/politics/38409-legislative-amendments-could-reshape-family-law-matters). “While the principles are largely the same, the act is substantially amended, so practitioners are going to have to be on top of that. “Lawyers are going to have to be across all the amendments, and specifically what the court is going to be looking at when they do deal with those cases, and make sure their evidence hits all the points the court will be looking at,” Ms Morgan explained. As part of the amendments, Ms Morgan said there will be a “massive push” – and even more so than before – for lawyers to help their clients through mediation procedures with the court. “The court should be the last resort for everybody, and that’s well accepted by family lawyers,” Ms Morgan said. “Practitioners should be using their skills to mediate where possible and empower clients to make arrangements they think are best.” Ms Morgan added family lawyers have “such an important role” in their client’s life, and they will be needed more than ever to assist in mediation, negotiations, or navigating the stress of the court system. “I feel very privileged to be able to help people through that process and be there for them through all that entails,” Ms Morgan said.
