    "text": "03 Jan 2025 | 04:26 AM UTC\nUS: Adverse winter weather forecast across northwestern regions through at least Jan. 4\nAdverse winter weather forecast over parts of the northwestern US through at least Jan. 4. Hazardous travel conditions likely.\nAdverse winter weather is forecast across parts of the northwestern US through at least Jan. 4. A Pacific system will bring another round of locally heavy coastal rains and higher elevation snow to the northwestern US and Rockies through Jan. 4. Ongoing coastal rain, a lower elevation mix of rain and snow, and higher elevation snow will begin to ramp back up late Jan. 2 as another system moves into the Pacific Northwest, bringing additional moisture to the coast and inland. Heavy rainfall is likely for upslope regions along the coastal ranges of southwestern Oregon and northern California and inland along the Sierra in northern California through Jan. 3. Some isolated instances of flooding will be possible. Heavy, accumulating snowfall is expected in the Cascades and Sierra and the northern Rockies Jan. 3 before spreading into the central Rockies Jan. 4 as the system continues inland. Snowfall totals of more than 0.3 meters (1 foot) are likely for the higher mountain peaks. A mix of light to moderate rain and some snow will pass inland through the Great Basin Jan. 3, with little to no accumulations expected.\nAs of late Jan. 2, the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued winter storm warnings across northeastern California and northern Montana. Winter weather advisories are in effect across most of the rest of the affected area. Officials could update and extend the coverage of the weather alerts over the coming days.\nSnow accumulations are likely across the affected region, especially at higher elevations. Lesser accumulations are possible where sleet and freezing rain mix with the snow, and precipitation is less intense. In addition to the heavy snow, strong wind gusts will likely lead to periods of blowing and drifting snow in some areas. Sporadic power outages could occur throughout the affected region.\nThe winter weather will likely disrupt ground and air transport across the region. Traffic and commercial trucking delays are probable along regional highways. Dangerous and challenging driving conditions are likely on secondary and rural roads in the affected states as maintenance crews prioritize clearing major routes. Authorities will probably close stretches of highways if driving conditions become too hazardous. Flight delays and cancellations are likely due to ground stops and deicing operations at regional airports.\nMonitor local media for updated weather information. Verify road conditions before driving in areas where heavy snowfall is forecast. Allow extra time to reach destinations in these areas and carry an emergency kit and warm clothes if driving is necessary, especially on secondary or rural routes that could become impassable. If routing shipments by truck through affected areas, plan accordingly for delivery delays. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "title": "How Victor Wembanyama's shoulder injury could cost him $50 million on his rookie contract extension | Sporting News United Kingdom",
    "text": "Just as Victor Wembanyama was coming off his first NBA All-Star appearance, the basketball world got the news Thursday that the Spurs ' 21-year-old star would miss the rest of the 2024-25 season.\nWembanyama — who is dealing with a deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder according to ESPN's Shams Charania — was in the midst of a dominant sophomore campaign, averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds and a league-leading 3.8 blocks per game.\nWhile Wembanyama's season-ending injury is disappointing for the Spurs and the NBA in general, it may also have further implications on his financial future.\nHere's how Wembanyama missing the rest of the 2024-25 season could affect his potential contract extension with San Antonio in the coming years.\nMORE: The latest injury updates on Victor Wembanyama\nVictor Wembanyama contract extension Wembanyama, in his second season after being selected first overall by San Antonio in the 2023 NBA Draft, has two years left on his rookie deal. Per Spotrac , he'll carry a $13,376,880 cap hit in 2025-26, then a $16,868,246 cap hit in 2026-27, when the Spurs are likely to exercise his team option.\nIn the 2026 offseason, Wembanyama will become eligible for a five-year, $271 million rookie extension, per ESPN . The star center could still increase the value of that extension to $326 million, but his recent injury will make that a bit tougher.\nBecause he'll miss the rest of the season, Wembanyama will be ineligible for NBA awards, including the Defensive Player of the Year award he was heavily favored to earn , as he'll play in fewer than 65 games.\nThe consequence of that missed time, and lack of awards, will extend into Wembanyama's future extension. Due to what's called the NBA's \"Rose rule,\" Wembanyama will have to have an elite 2026-27 season to increase his extension by more than $50 million in total.\nMORE: How Victor Wembanyama's injury could impact Spurs' Draft Lottery chances\nWhat is the Rose rule? The NBA has a rule in its CBA that doesn't officially have a name but is commonly referred to as the Rose rule — named after Derrick Rose, who won the 2011 MVP award in his third NBA season with the Bulls .\nUnder the Rose rule, players that are finishing their rookie contracts, as Wembanyama will be in a few years, are able to sign a maximum-salary contract that exceeded the usual limit for an NBA player with under seven years of experience. Rather than the usual 25%, these players on rookie contracts are eligible to sign a max contract worth 30% of the salary cap.\nYet only players that meet certain awards criteria in their first few seasons are eligible for the expanded max contracts under the Rose rule. Per Hoops Rumors , a player becomes eligible for the 30% max contract entering their fifth season when at least one of the following is true:\nThe player was named to an All-NBA team in the most recent season, or in two of the past three seasons. The player was named Defensive Player of the Year in the most recent season, or in two of the past three seasons. The player was named Most Valuable Player in any of the past three seasons. The Rose rule max extension can only be applied to extensions lasting at least four new years. Teams also do not have to sign a player to the 30% max contract even if they're eligible, as they could also agree to a deal in the 25-30% range of the salary cap — 30% is just the max.\nPlayers can also agree to conditional salaries that hinge on the player's performance in their fourth season, which is before the extension begins, based on which All-NBA team the player lands on.\nIn Wembanyama's case, he will not have any All-NBA appearances, Defensive Player of the Year awards or MVP awards by the end of the 2024-25 season (his second season) due to his season-ending injury and him missing the 65-game threshold.\nThat means when he becomes eligible to sign his contract extension in the 2026 offseason, he will not have more than one All-NBA appearance or Defensive Player of the Year award. To become eligible for the 30% max contract extension under the Rose rule, Wembanyama would have to do at least one of the following before his fifth season in 2027-28:\nBe selected to an All-NBA team in the 2026-27 season Be selected as the Defensive Player of the Year in the 2026-27 season Be selected as the league's MVP in either the 2025-26 season or 2026-27 season Even if Wembanyama is named to an All-NBA team or wins Defensive Player of the Year in 2025-26, he would still have to do the same in 2026-27 to earn the 30% max contract, as the Rose rule requires a player to either earn those honors in two of their last three seasons or in their fourth season alone.\nThe only way Wembanyama will be able to secure his larger extension with the Spurs next season is by winning MVP. Otherwise, his contract size could entirely depend on the awards he earns in 2026-27.",

    "text": "The government has closed a church in Maella, Naivasha sub-county, whose members do not use conventional medicine. As a result, it has emerged, some members of the church, including minors, have died in their homes from undiagnosed illnesses. The closure of 'Kanitha wa Ngai' (Church of God), follows a resolution of the Naivasha sub-county security team, coming after controversial deaths of four minors recently. The deaths caused a public outcry with residents questioning the activities of the church which is opposed to modern medicine. Police and residents had earlier rescued four ailing minors from one of the homes and arrested four suspects over alleged negligence. Naivasha Deputy Commissioner Mutua Kisilu said the police are investigating activities of the 'sect' which has over 200 members. Kisilu, who noted that the four suspects would be charged with various offences, said: \"Members of the sect do not believe in vaccination of children. We have been forced to close the church and rescue some of the minors and have them vaccinated as they were very sick.” \"The number of members of the sect in the sub-count is rising by the day. Some of the members have been brought up under the controversial doctrines of this church.” Mr Gilbert Njuguna, whose wife is a member of the church, said his child died and was hurriedly buried, within a day, while he was away. Ann Njeri, a member of the church, vowed they would not abandon their beliefs adding; \"Our medication is in heaven, not on earth.\" Njuguna who is incidentally a Community Health Promoter (CHP), said that members of the church did not believe in taking medication based on their religious beliefs. He said that he had fallen out with his wife after she joined the church adding that it should be investigated and closed down permanently. “One of my children died and was buried in the church compound while members camp in the church from Friday to Sunday conducting unknown businesses,” he said. Ann Njeri, a member of the church has however vowed that they would not abandon their beliefs noting that their treatment and medication lie in heaven and not on earth. The visibly emotional Njeri confirmed the death of one of her children who was buried in the church compound terming this as normal in their day-to-day life. Stay informed.

    "text": "Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Foto: Mario Guzmán. EFE El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador aseguró que México defenderá ante paneles internacionales el derecho de México sobre el litio, esto luego de una queja presentada por la minera china Ganfeng Lithium. En su conferencia mañanera de este jueves 27 de junio en Palacio Nacional, López Obrador recordó que en su gobierno se llevó a cabo una reforma para que el litio sea propiedad de la nación. López Obrador refirió que tuvo una reunión con el embajador de China en México, Zhang Run, con quien habló del tema, y le expuso que se debe dar un acuerdo con la compañía de aquel país asiático porque el litio fue nacionalizado en este sexenio. “Y no queremos que participen empresas particulares, se puede llevar a cabo una asociación, pero con el predominio del interés nacional, en el caso del litio. Sí vamos a acudir a estos paneles internacionales para defender nuestro derecho”, dijo. El presidente López Obrador consideró que “no aplica” el reclamo de la minera por la cancelación de concesiones relacionadas con el proyecto de una mina de extracción de litio en Sonora. “Hay una diferencia en cuanto a unas concesiones de minas de litio en Sonora de unas empresas de origen chino. Se está llevando a cabo un litigio porque nosotros consideramos que el litio es de la nación”, señaló.
