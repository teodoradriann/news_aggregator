The Mid-South Fair opening day is Thursday, Sept. 19, when the weather became more agreeable and the 3,000-space parking lot would be transformed by more than 50 rides, vendors and families taking in the final days of summer.\n“This is really the perfect place to plan an event this size,” said Russel Kissel of Kissel Entertainment, which is organizing the Mid-South Fair for the first time this year.\nTopics\n[DeSoto County](/index/tag?tag=DeSoto%20County) [North Mississippi](/index/tag?tag=North%20Mississippi) [Mid-South Fair](/index/tag?tag=Mid-South%20Fair) [Southaven](/index/tag?tag=Southaven) [Landers Center](/index/tag?tag=Landers%20Center) [Subscriber Only](/index/tag?tag=Subscriber%20Only)\nThank you for supporting local journalism.\nSubscribers to The Daily Memphian help fund our not-for-profit newsroom of nearly 40 local journalists plus more than 20 freelancers, all of whom work around the clock to cover the issues impacting our community.

    "title": "Children's Exodus - https://www.israeltoday.co.il/",
    "text": "The story of how an agnostic London stockbroker dropped everything to rescue children from an impending Holocaust tugs hard at the emotions. Definitely a recipe for a sleepless night.\nBut a round of applause for Warner Bros and the BBC for producing the heart-wrenching movie One Life, very appropriately released at a time when Jews are once again being wickedly harassed and abused in the wake of Israel’s defensive response to the murderous Hamas invasion of October 7th.\nThe subject is ‘British Schindler’ Sir Nicholas Winton (Anglicised from the German Wertheim) who courageously saved the lives of 669 children from Prague in Czechoslovakia following the Nazi invasion of their country and the beginnings of Germany’s genocidal actions against God’s chosen people. Their parents, for the most part, were already either killed or on their way to brutal concentration camps.\nWith Johnny Flynn playing the young Winton, Anthony Hopkins is a perfect fit for the older version in the late 1980s when the amazing story of what he achieved first became widely known through Robert Maxwell’s Sunday Mirror and Esther Rantzen’s That’s Life! programme on the BBC. Helena Bonham Carter plays his mother, backing him to the hilt, in the run-up to the outbreak of war. It was a huge task largely run from their Hampstead home in north London.\nThough born to Jewish parents, Winton was ‘baptised’ an Anglican but didn’t profess any particular faith, responding to the dire need he witnessed out of sheer human compassion. A man made in God’s image was simply reflecting the love of his Maker, risking his life and career for the sake of homeless and helpless kids in danger of starving. I cried at the scenes of them being torn away from relatives in a desperate attempt to save them.\nMeasured against the 1.5 million children who perished in the Holocaust, the hundreds saved by Winton’s intervention doesn’t seem much. But every life counts, and there are 6,000 people alive today because of what he did.\nThis ‘great escape’ also served to bring the gospel to the Jewish people, as I discovered some years ago when I wrote about one of them. For John Fieldsend was placed with a Christian family in Sheffield, eventually becoming a disciple of Jesus himself and getting involved with reaching out to his own people with the truth of their Messiah through the Church’s Ministry among Jewish people.\nFor her part, Esther Rantzen brought home the enormity of the rescue in dramatic fashion through her popular consumer advice programme. I well recall watching the show as the elderly Winton came face to face with the reality of what he had achieved. One after the other, every member of the audience stood up to acknowledge and thank him for his role in saving their lives. He was greatly moved and astonished. It was the best TV I’ve seen in over 50 years of living in England. And this film, though very upsetting, is an immensely moving account of the epic adventure of a very brave and determined young man who never sought any recognition.\nBut before he died in 2015, aged 106, he was honoured for services to humanity by our late Queen.\nWe haven’t always been welcoming to Jewish people in this country, much to our shame. But Sir Nicholas, perhaps inadvertently since he was not especially religious, has partially made up for our lack of concern by blessing thousands of them.\nFormer Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, much maligned by socialists, also did her bit by raising funds to enable her parents to host a Jewish refugee from Austria. Those who bless the seed of Abraham will indeed be blessed (Genesis 12:3)!\nWhen, in the movie, three siblings had to be separated because their hosts couldn’t manage more than two, my wife’s response was, “If we had been there, I would love to have taken all three of them!”\nWith Jewish people as unsafe and uncertain now as they were then, it’s time for Christians in particular to lead the way by standing up to be counted. We owe everything we cherish to the Jewish people – the Law and the Prophets, the Gospel, and Jesus himself, who said: “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” (Matthew 25:40)\nCharles Gardner is author of Israel the Chosen, available from Amazon; Peace in Jerusalem, available from\nolivepresspublisher.com; To the Jew First, A Nation Reborn, and King of the Jews, all available from Christian Publications International.\nIsrael Today Membership\nMonthly$5 / month Full access to Israel Today's Member-only content on all Digital Platforms.

    "text": "Social media influencer Kamiya Jani found herself embroiled in controversy following her visit to the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri. Her visit led to a series of demands for apologies, protests, and accusations from various political factions and cultural outfits.Jani, known for Curly Tales and her food blogging, addressed the issue through a video on Instagram, clarifying that she is a practicing Hindu who has never consumed or endorsed beef. She highlighted her intention behind visiting the temple as seeking blessings and sharing information about the shrine’s infrastructure development. Jani expressed regret that her visit had turned into a contentious matter.The BJP strongly criticized her visit, labeling her as a “beef eater” and questioning her entry into a Hindu-only shrine. They demanded action against Jani and VK Pandian, a bureaucrat turned BJD leader, allegedly involved in facilitating her visit.In contrast, BJD MP Manas Mangaraj questioned the BJP’s objections, citing instances where the BJP government engaged Jani to create documentaries on Hindu heritage and temples, including visits to revered sites like Chardham and Ayodhya.Union Minister Giriraj Singh criticized Pandian for disrespecting the sanctity of the shrine by allowing the entry of someone perceived as promoting beef. Singh urged immediate action against those responsible.Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan emphasized the need to protect the sentiments of Odias and followers of Sanatan Dharma, without directly mentioning Jani.OPCC president Sarat Pattnayak demanded an apology from Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik if Jani’s visit was under his directive.Local outfit Shree Jagannath Sankruti Surakha Abhijan protested in Bhubaneswar, echoing the demand for action against Jani and Pandian.While Jani issued clarifications twice, Pandian distanced himself from the matter and declined to comment further, simply stating, “Jai Jagannath.”",

    "text": "The Overlook Film Festival has announced its 2024 audience and jury award winning horror films, and among the biggest winners are Damian Mc Carthy’s Oddity and Cricket Arrison’s “Some Day All This Will Be Yours.” The 2024 Overlook Film Festival took place from April 4-7 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The eighth annual horror festival welcomed 90 filmmakers and featured 36 sold-out screenings and approximately six thousand audience members in attendance — the festival’s highest number of attendees to date. Taking home the feature film Audience Award, Oddity follows the story of a blind medium who resorts to desperate measures in an effort to find out the truth behind what happened to her sister. The award is voted on by festival attendees. Winning the Grand Jury Prize for Short Film was “Some Day All This Will Be Yours,” a short film the jury described as “an original and fearless new voice that explores the relationship between gender and horror in playful and profound ways.” Horror auteur Mike Flanagan (The Haunting of Hill House, The Fall of the House of Usher) waspresent at the festival to present a special 10th anniversary screening of his 2013 breakout film Oculus. He also received the festival’s Master of Horror Award. Previous recipients of the award include Roger Corman, Mick Garris, Stuart Gordon and Joe Dante. “I had an absolute blast at the Overlook Film Festival,” Flanagan said. “The audience, the festival staff and the fantastic New Orleans locations are just brimming with spirit, and I loved being so swept away. The anniversary screening of Oculus will remain one of the most surreal and satisfying screenings of my career, and I just can’t wait to find my way back for more. I left New Orleans with a smile on my face and swing in my ste Other highlights of this year’s festival was the world premiere of Abigail, the new film filmmaking collective Radio Silence, which played as the festival’s closing night film, and the opening night screening of Tilman Singer’s Cuckoo. More winners included the short film Audience Award winner, Masha Ko’s “The Looming” about aging and mental illness. The runner-up in that category was “MLM” by Brea Grant. The award for Scariest Short went to Carlos A.F. Lopez’s “Dream Creep”, which the jury called “a film exploring the profound horror of intimacy that immediately hooks the viewer with an unexpected and shocking premise.” The 2024 Overlook Film Festival short film jury was composed of film journalist Carlos Aguilar, NEON’s Sara Cushman and birth/rebirth director Laura Moss.

    "text": "福州新闻网>>\n新闻频道>>\n福州\n暴雨中，50米陡坡生死救援\n救援人员正在施救。\n“救出来了，人救出来了！”救援队员的吼声穿透雨幕，夹杂着难以抑制的激动。周围人听到后，紧绷许久的脸上瞬间绽开一丝笑容。\n受台风“丹娜丝”影响，连日来，福州市罗源县遭遇持续强降雨，山区水位暴涨，地质灾害风险陡增。10日，在罗源县西兰乡后路村三溪水库旁，乡、村两级干部与消防、社会救援力量冒雨展开了一场惊险的生命救援。\n“李书记，赵兴锦失踪了！”当天8时40分，后路村党支部书记李亮的手机突然响起，接通后传来该村其明水电站负责人徐金伙急促的声音。电话里，徐金伙焦急地说明情况：村民赵兴锦是水电站管理员，早上7时多到水电站附近的水渠清理杂物后就联系不上了。\n李亮的心瞬间揪紧，他当即放下手中应对台风的防汛报表，对身旁防台风工作组10多位党员干部喊道：“快，跟我去其明水电站！”\n此时，李亮已一天一夜没合眼，双眼通红。强降雨让他神经紧绷，每隔一小时就开车到村里的高陡斜坡和水位线巡逻。早上约7时30分巡逻时，他还见到赵兴锦，特意停车叮嘱：“今天雨大，清理杂物千万当心！”没想到一个小时后，就接到了赵兴锦失踪的消息。\n挂断电话，李亮立马向乡里上报。西兰乡迅速出动乡派出所全员，并安排村“两委”和包村干部兵分两路，一路去赵兴锦家，一路跟李亮沿三溪水库寻人。\n“赵兴锦……”“老赵……”水库边的呼喊声此起彼伏，然而，在骤雨中显得格外微弱。\n约40分钟后，徐金伙来电，李亮的手猛地攥紧了手机，听筒里传来：“找到了！在水库旁边有50米落差的坡底芦苇丛里！”\n当李亮带着村“两委”、包村干部和乡派出所全体民警赶到现场时，望着陡峭湿滑的山坡和湍急的水流，他们急得直跺脚。他立刻拨通消防救援电话：“快来！其明水电站有人坠落山坡，我们过不去，需要紧急救援！”\n接到报警，罗源县凤山消防救援站的消防车第一时间冲出车库，同时，罗源蓝豹救援队、曙光救援队的队员也立马往现场赶。\n救援人员接力将赵兴锦抬上陡坡。\n9时30分左右，消防、社会救援力量和医护人员几乎同时抵达现场。刚到山坡边，一名救援队员盯着下方地形，喊道：“没路！”\n只见50米陡坡下方的乱石堆被芦苇掩盖，水流顺着山坡形成小“瀑布”，脚下的泥土还在不断往下滑。\n“砍！”一个声音从人群中传来。随即，劈砍芦苇声、劈竹声立刻响起。救援人员深一脚浅一脚地在泥泞中开路，50米的陡坡，他们手脚并用往下探，有人脚下打滑，后面的人立刻伸手拽住，形成一条紧密相连的“人链”。\n抵达坡底后，队员很快发现了蜷缩在芦苇丛中的赵兴锦。原来，赵兴锦清理的水渠就在陡坡旁边，因为下了一整晚的雨，坡路湿滑，他在清理过程中不慎滑倒，跌入了坡底。因为手机不慎掉落水中，赵兴锦无法与水电站联系。此时，他头部的伤口还在渗血。\n罗源蓝豹救援队队长李进福迅速撕开纱布，上前按压伤口止血。“老乡！能听到吗？”\n赵兴锦虚弱地眨了眨眼，算是回应。见他意识尚清，李进福一边简单包扎，一边仰头对上方喊道：“快，递担架下来！”\n队员们迅速展开担架，小心翼翼地将赵兴锦抬上，并合力用绳索将其牢牢固定在上面，防止在转运途中受到二次伤害。一切准备就绪后，上方的救援人员拉紧绳索，下方的队员们用力将担架往上抬，两方默契配合，一步一步，将担架沿着陡坡往上送。\n好不容易将担架抬至相对平缓处，又出现了新问题。原来，从坡顶到救护车停车点尚有近1公里路，陡峭狭窄，多数地段仅容一人通过，并且大雨冲刷过的路面湿滑异常，乱石坑密布。救援人员硬着头皮，一前一后接力抬担架，深一脚浅一脚地在泥泞与乱石间艰难地挪动。\n11时许，随着暴雨渐停，赵兴锦终于被抬上救护车。“患者头部有创伤，肋骨疑似骨折，目前生命体征平稳。”赶往医院途中，随车医生为赵兴锦做了初步检查。\n救护车的鸣笛声渐渐远去，这场历时两个多小时的救援，在暴雨中写下了接力救援的一笔。\n记者了解到，经过罗源县医院的进一步检查，赵兴锦被确定为肋骨骨折。目前，他接受治疗后意识清醒，能够正常说话，后续需要住院几日继续观察治疗。（记者 陈欢欢 通讯员 刘舒婷 刘其燚 文/图）\n福州维持防汛Ⅲ级应急响应 市民需警惕降雨引发次生灾害(2025-07-11 09:11:35)Ⅲ级应急响应！暴雨还在下！福建多地发布红色预警(2025-07-11 08:59:58)风雨中 他们筑起坚强防线(2025-07-11 08:55:41)马尾区关于提升防暴雨应急响应为Ⅲ级的通知(2025-07-11 08:48:18)刚刚！红色预警！大雨、大暴雨已抵达福建(2025-07-11 08:41:37)出门请注意！福州升级暴雨红色预警！(2025-07-11 08:27:10)注意！福州升级发布暴雨橙色预警(2025-07-11 08:10:28)台风影响还未结束，请继续做好防范(2025-07-10 15:06:03)暴雨黄色预警！广东福建等地有大到暴雨局地特大暴雨(2025-07-10 11:17:59)福建暴雨预警Ⅱ级仍在生效中！福建沿海和南部地区有暴雨或大暴雨(2025-07-10 10:42:51)\n①凡本网注明“来源：福州新闻网”的所有文字、图片和视频，版权均属福州新闻网所有，任何媒体、网站或个人未经本网协议授权不得转载、链接、转贴或以其他方式复制发表。已经被本网协议授权的媒体、网站，在下载使用时必须注明“来源：福州新闻网”，违者本网将依法追究责任。\n②本网未注明“来源：福州新闻网”的文/图等稿件均为转载稿，本网转载出于传递更多信息之目的，并不意味着赞同其观点或证实其内容的真实性。如其他媒体、网站或个人从本网下载使用，必须保留本网注明的“来源”，并自负版权等法律责任。如擅自篡改为“来源：福州新闻网”，本网将依法追究责任。如对文章内容有疑议，请及时与我们联系。\n③ 如本网转载涉及版权等问题，请作者在两周内速来电或来函与福州新闻网联系。",

    "title": "De la révélation à la consécration : rencontre avec Clara Ysé, futur désirable de la chanson française",
    "text": "“Pour imaginer un futur désirable, il faut réussir à allier des outils anciens et contemporains”, dit-elle. Quand on entend la voix de Clara Ysé, travaillée depuis son enfance au registre lyrique, notamment auprès d’Yva Barthélémy, et les arrangements de ses pop songs, on ne peut que s’incliner devant l’illustration sonore de ses propos.\nAprès avoir bouleversé avec Le monde s’est dédoublé, single paru en 2018, quelques saisons après le décès accidentel de sa mère, la psychanalyste et philosophe Anne Dufourmantelle, elle a pris son temps pour façonner son premier album, Oceano Nox (2023). Lequel a été baptisé d’après un vers de L’Énéide de Virgile ( “et ruit Oceano Nox ” , “de l’océan s’élance la nuit”), réinventé par Victor Hugo qui écrivait : “Le corps se perd dans l’eau, le nom dans la mémoire . ”\nAnne Dufourmantelle s’est noyée en voulant sauver un enfant des eaux. Clara Ysé les convoque dans un disque pourtant traversé d’une rage de vivre ultra-inflammable, confectionné aux côtés d’Ambroise Willaume, alias Sage – toujours dans les bons plans puisqu’il œuvre aussi pour Clara Luciani, tout en menant le groupe Astral Bakers.\n“Si tu savais la haine qui coule dans mes veines/Tu aurais peur, tu aurais peur”, prévient Clara Ysé sur Douce . “Cet album parle de la nuit intime, de la manière dont on traverse la tristesse, la colère, comment elles cohabitent avec la douceur et la joie. Il ne s’agit pas seulement de moi : que fait-on de la nuit collective qui nous habite dans une période angoissante à de nombreux égards ?” Ainsi, des morceaux comme Pyromanes ou Les Rois du désespoir (paru dans la nouvelle édition d’ Oceano Nox ) résonnent fort, en particulier en live où l’assistance s’émeut de ces chansons de résilience interprétées la tête haute.\n“Sur la tournée, on a vraiment vu l’album prendre, les concerts s’afficher d’un coup tous complets, les dates se rajouter, s’enthousiasme-t-elle. Je suis très sensible au fait d’accueillir des gens sans leur demander qui ils sont, pour vivre ensemble des expériences heureuses. C’est rare et précieux, et même politique, dans une société où l’on est de plus en plus atomisés . ” Ce qui l’a menée en novembre sur la scène de l’Olympia, qu’elle foulera à nouveau en mars prochain : “C’est un rêve d’enfant qui se réalise, mais également une fête partagée avec mes amis, pour moi qui ai toujours vécu à Paris.”\nVerni d’une texture pop sophistiquée, porté par un timbre profond, ignorant avec superbe l’air du temps 2.0., Oceano Nox est un objet hybride, nourri des passions de Clara Ysé pour le classique, mais aussi pour la chanteuse argentine Mercedes Sosa, les musiques traditionnelles mexicaines, libanaises, iraniennes ou arméniennes : “J’avais envie de mélanger les trompettes avec une guitare électrique hyper-saturée, les polyphonies vocales avec des synthés et des rythmiques electro, de cultiver une certaine sensualité à travers cette quête sonore . ”\nDe quoi citer Lacan : “L’héroïsme, c’est de ne pas céder sur son désir, sur cette ligne intérieure que l’on ne peut nommer, mais dont on sait immédiatement si on l’a trahie.” En ont résulté quatre années d’un travail tant obsessionnel que cathartique en studio, qui a nécessité l’intervention d’une soixantaine d’instrumentistes d’horizons distincts.\nMulti-instrumentiste, vocaliste de haut vol, Clara Ysé est aussi écrivaine. À son actif, un roman publié chez Gallimard, Mise à feu (décidément, l’eau et les flammes sont faites pour s’unir chez elle), racontant comment deux enfants affrontent la disparition de leur mère, et un recueil de poèmes, Vivante (Seghers). Lequel nous agrippe par son écriture de lâcher-prise, tant dans l’expression des désirs charnels – au cœur des chansons de Clara Ysé – que dans l’exploration d’un onirisme libérateur : “Enfonce tes yeux sphinx, lèche pour y chasser la pluie/Tiens-toi à l’encolure, je cabre face à l’ennemi . ”\nLa musique et la poésie, vases communicants ? Viscéralement : “Très jeune, j’ai commencé à faire de la musique, qui reste mon absolu territoire de liberté, et à écrire des poèmes. Ces deux formes d’expression se sont rejointes et nourries mutuellement. Dans tous les cas, la recherche de sincérité m’importe, ce qui explique pourquoi je réalise mes clips, afin de suivre mon geste artistique de A à Z…\nChez moi, la musique répond à beaucoup de choses parfois difficilement formulables, mais il y a cette idée que, dans une époque où notre langage quotidien est sans cesse trusté, elle est une langue d’amour, une langue refuge protégée du mensonge, faite de formules magiques.” Ce n’est pas un hasard, donc, si l’un des morceaux d’ Oceano Nox a été baptisé Magicienne … et que l’on se laisse ensorceler à chaque apparition, sur scène ou sur papier, de Clara Ysé.\nOceano Noxx – nouvelle édition (Tôt ou Tard/Believe). Sorti depuis le 27 septembre. En tournée française et à l’Olympia, Paris, le 25 mars 2025.",

    "title": "Novedades y derechos laborales que te van a beneficiar este 2024",
    "text": "Novedades y derechos laborales en 2024 que benefician a los trabajadores\nSe acaba el año y son muchos los frentes que tienen abiertos desde el Ministerio de Trabajo de cara al 2024. Lo más inminente es la subida del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional, para la que Yolanda Díaz busca el apoyo de patronal y sindicatos (aunque no lo necesite), y que desde esta cartera ministerial propone que sea del 4%: el SMI alcanzaría así los 1.123 euros repartidos en 14 pagas (pagas extras aparte).\nCumplido este objetivo, previsiblemente este enero, uno de sus grandes retos será la reducción de la jornada de trabajo sin pérdida de salario: como explicó el Gobierno, pasaría a ser de 38,5 horas semanales en 2024 y bajaría finalmente hasta las 37,5 horas en 2025. Junto a este, se encuentra una asignatura pendiente que deberían haber cumplido en agosto de 2022, que es el cumplimiento de la Directiva Europea 2019/1152, para unas condiciones de trabajo previsibles y transparentes.\nGracias a esta, será obligatorio que los trabajadores cuenten con una información más completa de las condiciones de trabajo, con mayor antelación y por escrito. Aquí se incluye saber los días en los que se va a trabajar, la jornada laboral, la realización de horas complementarias en los contratos a tiempo parcial o los salarios. Sobre estos, hay también una exigencia de Europa que el Gobierno deberá cumplir obligatoriamente, que es acabar con el secretismo salarial: todas las ofertas de empleo legales deberán de reflejar el sueldo promedio que se va a cobrar en caso de resultar seleccionado. Aunque, para esto, se tendría más plazo: hasta junio de 2026.\nDerechos laborales que se tendrán que cumplir o aprobar en 2024 Junto a los anteriores, hay una serie de derechos que ya han sido aprobados por el Gobierno, y se deberán cumplir obligatoriamente desde enero, o bien se han comprometido a ello, asegurando que saldrán adelante durante el próximo año. Son los siguientes.\nCotización de los becarios Desde el 1 de enero de 2024, entra en vigor la cotización de los becarios. Los alumnos que realicen prácticas formativas o académicas externas incluidas en el plan de estudios, incluyendo tanto a los estudiantes universitarios (de grado, máster, doctorado, diploma o título propio de la universidad) como a los de Formación Profesional, comenzarán a cotizar durante su periodo de prácticas.\nїCГіmo serГЎn estas cotizaciones? Se trata de una cuota empresarial que se abonarГЎ por cada dГ­a de prГЎcticas, equivalente a 2,54 euros por contingencias comunes, excluida la prestaciГіn de incapacidad temporal, y de 0,31 euros por contingencias profesionales (0,16 euros corresponderГЎn a la contingencia de incapacidad temporal y 0,15 euros a las contingencias de incapacidad permanente y muerte y supervivencia), sin que pueda superarse la cuota mГЎxima mensual por contingencias comunes de 57,87 euros y por contingencias profesionales de 7,03 euros.\nNo obstante, la cuota por contingencias comunes está bonificada al 95%. La letra pequeña es que no cotizan por desempleo, por lo que estos periodos de prácticas no les van a servir a la hora de pedir el paro o los subsidios por desempleo. Sí, les beneficia de cara a las pensiones, ya que tendrán más tiempo cotizado.\nRetribución del permiso parental de 8 semanas El ministro de Derechos Sociales, Consumo y Agenda 2030, Pablo Bustinduy, confirmó que el permiso parental de 8 semanas será parcialmente retribuido: antes de agosto de 2024, cuatro semanas serán retribuidas. Es algo que exige la Directiva de Conciliación Europea 2019/1158, por lo que debe estar aprobado antes de este plazo.\nSin embargo, lo que aún se desconoce es si los trabajadores cotizarán durante el tiempo del permiso, ya que el artículo 45 Estatuto de los Trabajadores recoge que es “causa de suspensión del contrato”. Por ello, las obligaciones de empresa y trabajadores se suspenden durante su disfrute. Con la retribución parcial, habrá que ver si se va a cotizar durante las cuatro semanas en las que se seguirá percibiendo salario.\nAmpliación de la baja por maternidad y paternidad Pablo Bustinduy también confirmó que la baja por maternidad y paternidad, que se trata oficialmente de la prestación por nacimiento y cuidado del menor, se va a ampliar a 20 semanas, frente a las 16 de ahora. Según fuentes del Gobierno, con esta ampliación se baraja la posibilidad de poder flexibilizar las cuatro nuevas semanas de permiso con un trabajo a tiempo parcial.\nIndemnizaciones por despido mayores El Ministerio de Trabajo también tendrá que abordar una reforma de la indemnización por despido. Como se recordó a finales de año, España ratificó al completo la Carta Social Europea, donde se recoge un derecho muy importante: los trabajadores que sean despedidos sin causa objetiva podrán acceder a indemnizaciones superiores a 33 días, que es el máximo actual.\nEs algo que también busca la ministra, Yolanda Díaz, y que recogió en su programa político de Sumar: “Tengan mi palabra. Vamos a cumplir con lo que resuelva el Comité Europeo de Derechos Sociales porque es la fuente de derecho en nuestro país. Creo que debemos actuar”, explicó en una de sus intervenciones en el Congreso de los Diputados.\nAl respecto, desde su partido abarcaban la idea del despido “restaurativo”, donde la indemnización por despido se calcula en función de las circunstancias del trabajador. Por ejemplo, si es mayor de 60 años, se entenderá que el perjuicio causado es mayor, ya que tiene más dificultades para encontrar empleo y, por tanto, la cuantía de la indemnización debería ser más alta.\nOposiciones más rápidas En lo que respecta a los funcionarios, se ha hablado mucho de las evaluaciones de desempeño o de los nuevos complementos que van a percibir en 2024, pero también hay una importante novedad a la hora de promocionar o convertirse en funcionario: a partir de 2024, se deberán convocar las plazas en el mismo año en que se anunciaron en la Oferta de Empleo Público.\nAdemás, habrá un plazo máximo de dos años para que se ejecute la convocatoria y en, el caso de las oposiciones, los procesos no podrán durar más de un año. En conjunto, las plazas anunciadas se van a cubrir más rápido que actualmente.",
