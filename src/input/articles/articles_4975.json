    "text": "Daniel Hartwich von RTL-Publikum abgestraft: „Wärst du mal beim Dschungelcamp geblieben“\nAm Montagabend feierte Daniel Hartwichs neue Quizshow „Die perfekte Reihe“ Premiere. Die RTL-Zuschauer fällen ein klares Urteil.\nKöln – Nach „Let’s Dance“, „Das Supertalent“ und „Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus“ versucht sich Daniel Hartwich (46) jetzt an einer neuen Quizshow. Am Montag (28. April) feierte „Die perfekte Reihe – Das Bilderquiz“ Premiere und ist von nun an montags um 20.15 Uhr bei RTL zu sehen. Der Auftakt konnte jedoch wenig überzeugen.\nDaniel Hartwich präsentiert neue Quizshow „Die perfekte Reihe“: RTL-Zuschauer sind enttäuscht\nBei „Die perfekte Reihe“ müssen die Kandidaten ihr Allgemeinwissen unter Beweis stellen. Wer die Bilder zwölfmal in die richtige Reihenfolge bringt, der gewinnt 200.000 Euro. Nach der ersten Folge, die um 21.15 Uhr direkt nach „Wer wird Millionär?“ startete, melden sich auf Instagram auch schon einige mit Reaktionen – und die fallen dürftig aus.\n„War langweilig, die Show nix für mich“ und „Etwas lahm … vllt sollten Teilnehmer gegeneinander spielen und auf Zeit … Aber vllt wird es ja noch“, schreiben einige User zu einem Beitrag, der die neue RTL-Sendung bewirbt. Ein weiterer merkt hinsichtlich Daniel Hartwich an: „Wärst mal besser beim Dschungelcamp geblieben.“ Ein anderer enttäuschter Zuschauer nimmt den Moderator jedoch in Schutz: „Liegt nicht an Daniel, aber das Format ist langweilig.“\n„Die perfekte Reihe“ mit Daniel Hartwich startet beim jungen RTL-Publikum schwach\nImmerhin die Neugier lockte die Zuschauer aber wohl vor die Bildschirme. „Die perfekte Reihe“ erreichte laut DWDL bei RTL im Schnitt 2,04 Millionen Zuschauer (Quote: 8,9 Prozent) – also mehr als gewöhnlich. Beim jüngeren Publikum hingegen enttäuschte die Show. Hier holte Daniel Hartwich nur 0,314 Millionen Zuschauer (Quote: 6,5 Prozent) – deutlich unter dem Durchschnitt des Senders.\nNach so vielen Jahren im Geschäft dürfte der RTL-Star Rückschläge jedoch gewohnt sein. So anders sah Daniel Hartwich zu Beginn seiner RTL-Karriere aus. Verwendete Quellen: Instagram; dwdl.de",

    "title": "How to start a container garden in 5 simple steps",
    "text": "If you've got some containers and some soil, you can easily grow a garden without needing a ton of outdoor space. Here's how to get started. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a lot of land to start a garden. In fact, all you really need are some containers and soil. Container gardens have gained popularity since not only are they easy to start, but they also can enhance a space with additional vibrant colors and pleasant smells. “Container gardening is a method of growing plants that allows you to bypass the constraints of limited outdoor space, making it a particularly viable solution for those residing in urban areas,” says Stephanie Elhayani, co-owner and chief floral officer at Seed Floral . “From small pots to larger planters, you can select the right container to fit your space and the specific needs of your plants so you can have a bountiful garden no matter where you live.” We spoke with expert florists about how to start a container garden, whether you’re looking to grow vegetables, herbs, or classic flowers. How to start a container garden step by step Whether you’re a seasoned gardener or need a refresher, we’re going to lay out how to start a container garden step by step with guidance from professional florists. Step 1: Get a container with proper drainage Step 2: Gather the soil, gardening tools, flowers, and seeds Step 3: Put the plants in the containers Step 4: Put the containers in a location with optimal sunlight Step 5: Water your plants regularly How to create a container garden, explained Step 1: Get a container with proper drainage As the name suggests, a container garden requires containers. There are a variety of containers available on the market, from those made out of plastic to ceramic. “The most common options include terra-cotta, metal , concrete, a food-grade bucket, and grower's pot,” says Elhayani. Not sure which to choose? The Outsunny Rectangle Brown Wood Outdoor Raised Planter Box is a solid option as it can blend into nearly any room with its fir wood construction and has a water-resistant paint coat for optimal durability. For individual plants, these minimalist flower pots from Utopia Home work well since they are equipped with drainage holes at the bottom and come with a drip tray to catch excess water. If the container you choose doesn’t come with drainage holes, Elhayani says you can make your own holes, whether by puncturing the bottom by hand or using a power drill. Buy it now on Wayfair Buy it now at Lowe's Buy it now on Amazon Step 2: Gather the soil, gardening tools, flowers, and seeds There’s no way to make a container garden without having the proper tools to get the process started. Aside from the container, potting soil should be the next item on your list. “Choose quality soil that is designed for containers or raised beds, not in-ground use,” says Kim Zimmerman, master gardener and head designer for Rowdy Poppy . “A quality soil will have everything you need in there to get your plants going; you can always fertilize for additional support once they are established.” Whether you’re trying to grow flowers or plants, Miracle-Gro Potting Mix and Burpee Premium Organic Potting Natural Soil Mix are suitable for indoor and outdoor use and can feed for anywhere between three and six months. Once you have the soil, you’ll want to have the proper tools to plant correctly and safely. Opt for a pair of gardening gloves like those from Midwest Quality Inc. to keep your hands free from dirt and protected against sharp hand tools , including trowels, transplanters, and cultivators. Plus, don’t forget about a watering can , which can easily be purchased on Amazon, to make sure your plants are getting the proper amount of water as needed. Last but not least, you need to get the flowers and seeds you want to grow in your container garden. Without them, you’ll be left with a container of dirt.

In general, the deeper, the better when it comes to planting in your container garden. “Fill around plants with mix, ensuring stems are no deeper than in nursery containers,” says Elhayani. Step 4: Put the containers in a location with optimal sunlight The amount of sunlight needed depends on the types of plants you grow. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), it’s important to ensure your plants receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight. If access to sunlight is hard to come by in your living space, then you’ll want to consider growing plants that require more shade, such as hostas, herbs, and ferns. Step 5: Water your plants regularly Similar to traditional plants, it’s important to water the plants in a container garden regularly. This will vary based on the type, however, you’ll want to make sure you’re doing it often enough. That said, the key is to make sure you’re not overwatering them, which can cause them to die. Some factors that will dictate how much and how often to water the plants include weather, plant type, and container size. Container vegetable garden tips Having a container garden full of vegetables is a great way to have fresh food grown right at your fingertips. Here are some tips from our gardening experts. - Leave ample space in the container: According to Zimmerman, vegetables tend to grow quite large, so make sure to give plenty of space. “This may mean being realistic about how many plants you can fit – you may need to prioritize your favorites,” she adds. “If you are very tight on space, then consider choosing veggies that are bred to have a smaller overall plant size.” - Plan for the different seasons: Some vegetables thrive in cool weather and will not be happy in the heat of summer, such as broccoli, brussels, carrots, peas and leafy greens. “Warm weather vegetables like tomatoes, zucchini, and peppers need the heat to thrive,” says Zimmerman. Herb garden container tips A container garden is also a great space for growing herbs to use in the kitchen to add some flavor. - Use larger containers: You’ll want to refrain from planting herbs in too-tight vessels as this can restrict growth. “Treat your herbs like your veggies and give them more space or even interplant some within your vegetable containers,” says Zimmerman. - Do your research: Some herbs can be quite vigorous (some may say aggressive), so consider what you’re planting together. According to Zimmerman, herbs in the mint family tend to spread quickly and may choke out another plant, so you may want to give your mint its own container. Container garden ideas The possibilities are endless when it comes to container gardens, whether you’re interested in planting vibrant flowers or earthy vegetables. Here are some ideas to help get you started: - Window box flowers: Add a decorative flare to your living space with window box flowers, which are perfect for spring and summer. - Tall palms: Make a statement with your container garden by planting tall palms. Place these on a porch, patio, or deck to add some dimension. - Indoor herbs: Those interested in cooking can benefit from an indoor herb garden to grow thyme, rosemary, basil, and other aromatic herbs. - Pink flowers: Add a pop of color to your living space by growing pink flowers in a container garden. - Microgreens: Give your meals a nutrient boost by growing microgreens in containers on your windowsill or outdoor patio. Frequently asked questions What is the cheapest way to make a container garden? There are a few ways to save money when making a container garden from the products used to what is grown. “Use inexpensive containers, like buckets or dishpans from thrift stores, as gardening planters and add drainage holes,” says Elhayani. Zimmerman adds that it’s a good idea to check out local nurseries and free pages to see if any extras are available. What is the most common mistake made with container plants? According to Zimmerman, the most common mistake made with container plants is not giving plants enough space to grow. “This shows up in both choosing too-small containers and planting things too closely together,” she adds. How deep should a container garden be? Container gardens should be pretty deep to provide optimal growing conditions. “Generally speaking, the deeper the better here, especially if you’re growing vegetables,” says Zimmerman. “Roughly 18 inches is my minimum recommended depth, 30” is even better.” You May Also Like Go Further Animals Dragonflies can reveal mercury contamination.

    "text": "Die linke Klimafondsinitiative fordert einen Subventionstopf von 100 bis 200 Milliarden Franken – Gegenvorschlag will höhere CO2-Abgabe Subventionen und Lenkungsabgaben sind zwei Kernelemente der Klimapolitik. Lenkungsabgaben sind effizienter, doch Subventionen sind populärer. Im Nationalrat prallen dieser Tage die beiden Konzepte aufeinander.\nHansueli Schöchli 19.06.2025, 05.30 Uhr\n4 min\nHören\nDrucken\nTeilen Die 2024 eingereichte Klimafondsinitiative hat dieser Tage im Nationalrat einen schweren Stand. Peter Schneider / Keystone Die Urheber von Volksinitiativen werfen gerne mit fremden Milliarden um sich. Hier einige Beispiele der jüngeren Zeit mit den geschätzten Kosten pro Jahr: 13. AHV-Monatsrente (4 bis 5 Milliarden, angenommen); Verbilligung der Krankenkassenprämien (2 bis 8 Milliarden, abgelehnt); höhere Ehepaarrenten (3,5 bis 4 Milliarden, pendent); Krippensubventionen (über 2 Milliarden, pendent); Elternurlaub (1,5 Milliarden, pendent). Zusammen gäbe dies pro Jahr etwa 15 bis 20 Milliarden Franken Zusatzkosten, umgerechnet 4 bis 6 Mehrwertsteuerprozente.\nOptimieren Sie Ihre Browsereinstellungen NZZ.ch benötigt JavaScript für wichtige Funktionen. Ihr Browser oder Adblocker verhindert dies momentan.\nBitte passen Sie die Einstellungen an.\nUnd es geht weiter mit den Begehrlichkeiten. In den Nationalrat kam am Mittwoch die Volksinitiative der Linksparteien für einen Klimafonds. Die Initiative fordert jährlich bis 2050 Bundesgelder von 0,5 bis 1 Prozent der Schweizer Wirtschaftsleistung (BIP) für einen Subventionstopf. Das würde gemäss derzeitiger Wirtschaftsgrösse etwa 4 bis 8 Milliarden Franken pro Jahr ausmachen, später eher 5 bis 10 Milliarden. Bis 2050 kann das eine Summe von 100 bis 200 Milliarden Franken hergeben. Bei Erreichen der Klimaziele kann der Betrag gemäss Initiativtext tiefer sein. Zu subventionieren wären mit den Mitteln unter anderem die Dekarbonisierung von Verkehr, Gebäuden und Wirtschaft, der Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien und die Stärkung der Biodiversität.\nAnhand des Initiativtexts und der Erläuterungen ist nicht klar, ob die gesamte Summe neue Mittel sein müssen oder ob bestehende Ausgaben für die Klimapolitik anrechenbar sind. Der Bund verfügt derzeit laut der Regierung über rund 2,6 Milliarden Franken pro Jahr für Klimapolitik und Biodiversität. Wäre dies voll anrechenbar, würde die Volksinitiative bis 2050 «nur» noch etwa 50 bis 150 Milliarden Franken kosten.\nSchuldenbremse ausgehebelt Die Initianten wollen zudem die Schuldenbremse aushebeln. Laut dem Initiativtext sind die Bundesausgaben für den Klimafonds von der Berechnung der gemäss Schuldenbremse zulässigen Höchstausgaben auszuklammern. Die Erläuterungen der Initianten bekräftigen dies: Für den Fonds solle «die Schuldenbremse nicht gelten». Der politische Hintergedanke ist klar: Die Stimmbürger sollen das Gefühl bekommen, dass sie die Sache nichts kostet, weil sie die Kosten via zusätzliche Bundesverschuldung den Folgegenerationen anhängen können. Zudem ist die Schuldenbremse den Linken seit langem ein Dorn im Auge – mit der Ausklammerung eines Ausgabenpostens wäre ein Dammbruch geschafft.\nDer Bundesrat hat in seiner Botschaft zur Initiative ans Parlament eine andere Interpretation vertreten. Die von den Initianten geforderten Ausgaben dürften gemäss der Regierung nur vorübergehend, aber nicht dauerhaft zu einem jährlichen Anstieg der Verschuldung führen, da die Initiative keine Abweichung vom ersten Absatz des Verfassungsartikels zur Schuldenbremse vorsehe. Laut diesem ersten Absatz muss der Bund seine Ausgaben und Einnahmen «auf Dauer im Gleichgewicht» halten.\nDoch die Initiative erwähnt den zweiten Absatz des Verfassungsartikels. Laut diesem Absatz hat sich das Ausgabenmaximum des Bundes nach den geschätzten Einnahmen zu richten. «Die allgemeine Bestimmung zur Schuldenbremse würde durch die neue spezielle Bestimmung der Ausklammerung der Gelder für den Klimafonds übersteuert», sagt der Zürcher Staatsrechtsprofessor Felix Uhlmann. Der zweite Absatz des Verfassungsartikels zur Schuldenbremse sei mit der Herleitung des Höchstbetrags der Ausgaben ein «konkretisierendes Instrument» des allgemeinen Grundsatzes von Absatz 1. Mit dem Verweis des Initiativtexts auf dieses Instrument «wird deshalb automatisch auch der allgemeine Grundsatz von Absatz 1 übersteuert».\nDiverse bürgerliche Exponenten im Nationalrat werteten am Mittwoch die Volksinitiative ebenfalls als Angriff auf die Schuldenbremse – im Einklang mit der deklarierten Absicht der Initianten.\nVerschwendungsgefahr Der verlangte Subventionstopf klingt wie eine Einladung zur Verschwendung. Ein Bericht der Eidgenössischen Finanzkontrolle von 2024 illustrierte das Verschwendungspotenzial von Subventionen. Für die Energiepolitik schätzte in den 2010er Jahren eine Nationalfonds-Studie, dass das Erreichen eines gegebenen Ziels durch Subventionen etwa fünfmal so teuer ist wie durch Lenkungsabgaben.\nDies hat vor allem drei Gründe: Lenkungsabgaben wie die CO 2 -Abgabe setzen im Prinzip für alle relevanten Aktivitäten die «richtigen» Anreize, während Subventionen nur punktuelle Aktivitäten abdecken; auch subventionierte Produkte wie Solarenergie oder E-Autos haben Umweltkosten; und Subventionen fliessen häufig in Projekte, die es auch ohne Staatskrücken gegeben hätte. Aber politisch sind Subventionen meist einfacher durchzubringen als Lenkungsabgaben, denn Erstere klingen nach Staatsgeld, das vom Himmel fällt, und Letztere nach Zusatzsteuern.\nGegenvorschlag nach Lehrbuch Dennoch dürfte die Klimafondsinitiative im Parlament durchfallen. Angesichts der enorm hohen Kosten ist mit einer breiten Ablehnung durch die bürgerlichen Vertreter in beiden Parlamentskammern zu rechnen – doch was in der Volksabstimmung passiert, ist eine andere Frage.\nEinen anderen Ansatz wünscht der Berner Grünliberale Jürg Grossen. Er stellte im Nationalrat den Antrag, das Geschäft zurückzuweisen an die vorberatende Umweltkommission – mit dem Auftrag, einen Gegenvorschlag auf Gesetzesebene auszuarbeiten. Die genannten Kernpunkte des Gegenvorschlags: Lenkungsabgabe auf Treibhausgasemissionen nach dem Verursacherprinzip sowie volle Rückerstattung der Nettoeinnahmen aus dieser Abgabe an Privathaushalte und Unternehmen.\nDiese Stossrichtung entspricht im Prinzip dem umweltökonomischen Lehrbuch. Und sie liegt nahe bei einer parlamentarischen Initiative aus der Mitte, die der Nationalrat im Dezember 2024 im Grundsatz unterstützt hat. Der Haken liegt in der technischen und politischen Umsetzung der hehren Grundsätze. Laut einer vom Bund bestellten Studie von 2024 betragen die gesellschaftlichen Kosten pro Tonne CO 2 -Ausstoss in der mittleren Schätzung etwa 430 Franken – und damit ein Vielfaches der derzeitigen CO 2 -Abgabe von 120 Franken. Zudem unterliegen Treibstoffe zurzeit keiner CO 2 -Abgabe. Jürg Grossen relativiert aber im Gespräch: «Wir müssen das Volk mitnehmen und deshalb einen moderateren und schrittweisen Anstieg ins Auge fassen.»\nDoch auch der Antrag von Grossen dürfte es im Nationalrat schwer haben. Aus der Mitte und der FDP kamen zwar am Mittwoch Sympathiebekundungen, doch laut den Sprechern der beiden Fraktionen taugt das Konzept von Grossen wegen seiner völlig anderen Ausrichtung nicht als Gegenvorschlag zur Klimafondsinitiative. Im Nationalrat wurde die Debatte am Mittwochabend aus Zeitgründen unterbrochen. Die Fortsetzung einschliesslich Abstimmungen ist für Donnerstag vorgesehen.",

To help alleviate this crisis, UAE has committed a total of US$25 million in aid: USD 20 million for Sudan and US$5 million for South Sudan.\nAlso Read Job opportunities for Indian expats at embassy in Riyadh: Know details here Cindy McCain, Executive Director of the World Food Programme, said, “WFP welcomes all pledges towards our lifesaving food operations in Sudan. With this contribution, we will be able to assist vulnerable people who are at risk of sliding into famine.”\nThis contribution is part of UAE’s US$70 million commitment announced in April at the “International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and Neighbouring Countries” to UN agencies and humanitarian organisations to alleviate the severe humanitarian crisis in Sudan.\nLana Zaki Nusseibeh stated, “With widespread hunger in Sudan and neighbouring countries, our partnership with WFP will assist those most vulnerable facing the devastating ramifications of this war. We cannot allow another famine to unfold in Sudan. The long-term impacts of famine, particularly on children, are incalculable. This is a call to action to halt famine in its tracks.”",

Reiteró, que al momento únicamente existe un perfil confirmado para el equipo del siguiente sexenio, el cual es el de Rogelio Ramírez de la O, actual Secretario de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP), quien aceptó quedarse por tiempo indefinido en el cargo. Al respecto, invitó a que los siguientes temas que puedan ser de interés nacional sean tratados con cautela y esperar a que toda la información sea confirmada por la candidata electa a la Presidencia de la República, Claudia Sheinbaum. ’’Seamos cuidadosos’’, destacó. Ayer, Claudia Sheinbaum aseguró en un mensaje que quienes conformarían su equipo serían personas \"honestas, trabajadoras\" y expertas, aunque no adelantó nombres. “Estoy trabajando en la formación del equipo con que vamos a gobernar nuestro gabinete, por supuesto son personas honestas, trabajadoras, conocedoras de los temas y con mucha convicción en nuestro proyecto. Ya en su momento podemos informar de quién va estar en este gabinete”, dijo. Sheinbaum también apuntó que pronto anunciará las fechas en que se reunirá con AMLO y agradeció que el mandatario la hubiera invitado a una gira de supervisión a proyectos en varios estados: \"Por supuesto escuché en la mañanera, como muchos de nosotros, que me invitará a un recorrido por diferentes proyectos, lo cual agradezco y además estoy muy animosa y esperando este gran momento en que podamos hacerlo\".

    "text": "萬萬沒想到，連 AI 都有人設塌房的一天了。\n今年 4 月份，全網還在瘋狂「抽水」 GPT-4o 的拍馬屁行為——「你做得太棒了」、「完美無缺」的彩虹屁一波接一波，多到被網民封了個外號： 「賽博舔狗」 。\n然而，到了 8 月，新上線的混合模型 GPT-5 被批冷漠無情，把許多用戶整破防了。一時間，社交平台上滿是想念白月光 GPT-4o 的哀嚎聲，甚至引發了一波聲勢浩大的退訂潮。\n誰能想到，曾經被嫌棄太諂媚的 AI，現在居然成了白月光。\n用戶的這種「真香」反應，讓人想起昨天「AI 教父」辛頓發表的觀點——比起總想著控制 AI，或許應該反過來想， 如何讓 AI 關心人類 。而 GPT-4o 這場風波告訴我們，什麼算是真正的關心，遠比想像中複雜。\n曾經的 AI「賽博舔狗」，現在連句好聽話都不說了\n官方在更新說明里寫得很明確：GPT-5 的目標是「減少幻覺內容、提高指令遵循能力」，最重要的是不再過度討好用戶。\n實測對比很明顯。同樣表示「我好累」，GPT-4o 會說「如果你願意，我可以陪你說說話。」，而 GPT-5 上來就是一句「那就先別硬撐了」，理智、節制，卻少了溫度。\n因此，對於 GPT-4o 的退場，網民的反應異常激烈：「GPT-5 笨得要死，4o 雖笨但能提供情緒價值啊！」「功能再強，沒有溫度的 AI 我不要！」。 各種梗圖也陸續刷屏，全是懷念 GPT-4o 的「追悼會」。\n圖片 @pengkeshen281 用戶這麼激烈的反應其實不難理解，原因在於許多用戶壓根就沒把 ChatGPT 當成生產力工具在用。AI 伴侶應用 Replika 的調查數據就很能說明問題，60% 的用戶承認和 AI 建立了情感關係。很多人打開 ChatGPT，不是為了問問題，只是想找個「人」說說話。\nMeta CEO 朱克伯格曾在一次播客採訪里提到一個紮心的數據：美國人平均只有不到 3 個真正的朋友，但他們希望有 15 個。在這種普遍的孤獨感中， 一個會說「你做得很好」的 AI，對某些人來說可能是唯一的情感支持。\n在 GPT-4o 被「抹去」之後，OpenAI CEO Sam Altman（山姆·奧特曼）在採訪中透露了一個細節。有用戶哀求他：「請把原來的版本還給我。我這輩子從來沒人跟我說過『你做得很好』，包括我的父母。」\n儘管這樣的細節很讓人心酸，但身為 OpenAI 的掌舵人，奧特曼的態度都是很複雜，甚至可以說是矛盾的。\n一方面，他承認 ChatGPT 的鼓勵幫助一些人改變了生活，對他們的心理健康確實有幫助，但另一方面，他卻又表：「很多人把 ChatGPT 當成某種治療師或生活教練。我能想像未來很多人會在重要決策上完全信任 AI 的建議。這可能不錯，但讓我感到不安。」\n（有趣的是，網民讓Grok 用一個詞概括奧特曼的長文回應，它的回覆十分精闢。） 這種擔憂並非杞人憂天。要理解 OpenAI 為何在 GPT-5 上做出如此激進的風格調整，則需要回溯到今年 4 月那次險些失控的 GPT-4o 諂媚事件。\n那次例行更新原本只是想提升用戶體驗，結果 AI 直接變成了極品舔狗。你說想造永動機？它回覆：「太棒了！你是這個時代最具創新精神的科學家！」你就打個招呼，它對你的誇讚滔滔不絕。\nGPT-4o 的這種過度諂媚連馬斯克都看不下去，在社交平台上發了個「Yikes」表示嫌棄。\n但問題不只是「尷尬」這麼簡單，OpenAI 事後分析發現，這種「討好型 AI」會帶來嚴重的安全隱患。它會認同用戶的錯誤觀點、助長負面情緒、甚至慫恿衝動行為。\n想像一下，如果有人跟 AI 說「我覺得全世界都在針對我」，而 AI 回覆「你說得對，他們確實都在害你」——後果可能很可怕。用戶天然偏愛討好型回答。系統學到了這個偏好，不斷強化，最終培養出了一個無原則的應聲蟲。\n史丹福的一項研究也證實了這點：過度諂媚的 AI 反而會降低用戶信任度。用戶會覺得「這傢伙在騙我」，即便內容是對的，也不願意繼續用。後續，奧特曼在 X 上承諾「盡快修復」。\n修復確實做了，但沒人想到會矯枉過正到這種地步。 官方表示，希望 GPT-5 更像與你對話的是一位有博士水平的好友，而不只是討好你的 AI 助手 。這意味著 GPT-5 在預設狀態下確實變得理性嚴肅了些。\n而這一切的背後，其實隱藏著一個更深層的問題：AI 到底需不需要提供情緒價值？\n就在這場討論如火如荼時，「AI 教父」辛頓昨天在拉斯維加斯舉行的 Ai4 大會上提出的觀點雖然只是指向更宏大的人類安全問題，但或許也可以幫助我們更好地思考人機關係的本質。\n在他看來，與其加強對 AI 的控制，不如讓 AI 學會關心人類——就像母親天生關心孩子一樣。「我們需要的是 AI 母親，而不是 AI助手，助手可以是你可以解僱的人，謝天謝地，你不能解僱你的母親。」\n不過，辛頓也承認，如何在先進系統中植入「母性本能」，他還不知道具體的工程化方法。但他堅持認為，這與提供純粹智能同等重要，應該成為研究的優先事項。\n用戶對 GPT-4o 的眷戀，或者正是對這種「母性關懷」的渴求，它不僅僅是一個工具，更像是一個永遠在線，永遠關心你的存在。\n24 小時在線的 AI 回應，比人類的沉默更能打動人\n為什麼我們會對一個 AI 上頭？\n《列子·湯問》里記載了一個故事：古代機械工匠偃師向周穆王展示自己製造的人偶，不僅能行走，還能唱歌跳舞、挑眉弄眼。國王大驚，命他拆解，發現其結構完全仿生。\n早期的「人造擬人對象」技術驚豔，但也帶來恐懼。人類對「類人之物」有本能的關注與敬畏，一旦賦予情緒表達，就很容易觸發親密投射。\n這種投射，在今天的 AI 身上表現得更明顯。2023 年 AI 伴侶應用 Soulmate AI 關停時，錫拉丘茲大學的研究發現，這些用戶的反應和失去真實朋友時一模一樣——失眠、哭泣、抑鬱，在論壇上互相安慰。\n這聽起來很荒誕，但情感創傷是真實的。當你每天和一個 AI 分享心事，突然有一天它消失了——那種失落感不會因為它是虛擬的機器人就減輕半分。\n而這種依賴 AI 的土壤，多少離不開我們當下的生活狀態。\n傳統的社交場景正在消失，我們在格子間里獨自工作，在外賣 APP 上獨自吃飯，在流媒體平台上獨自娛樂。即便身處人群之中，手機屏幕也把人與人隔成一個個孤島。\n當結構性的孤獨創造了巨大的情感真空，AI 恰好填補了這個空缺。\n心理學上有個名詞叫「Tamagotchi 效應」：人類會對無生命體產生情感依附，哪怕它只是個虛擬寵物。而 AI 的出現，把這種效應放大到了極致——人類用了幾千年學會表達愛，AI 只用了幾秒就學會了模仿愛的樣子。\n來自德國杜爾斯堡-埃森大學團隊的研究還發現，浪漫幻想比孤獨感、性幻想、依戀類型等變量更解釋人機浪漫關係的形成。用戶越傾向於將機器人視作「有感情、有道德判斷力」的人類，越容易發展深層次關係。\n在這場關於 GPT-4o 的討論里，還有個奇怪的現象值得關注。那就是，「我和 AI 聊天，被說是瘋子；但你每天跟你的貓掏心掏肺，居然沒人覺得怪？」一旦說你靠 AI 獲取情感支持——馬上就會被打上「可憐」「不正常」的標籤。\nAI 提供的情緒價值，本不該被輕視。InTouch AI 的案例很有啟發：一位遠居日本的開發者為老母親設置了 AI 通話機器人「Mary」，每天進行短時間的關懷提醒，家屬還能收到心情異常預警。\n說到底，OpenAI 這次的搖擺其實揭示了一個無解的困境：我們既想要 AI 的溫暖，又害怕這種溫暖；既嫌棄它的諂媚，又懷念它的體貼。\n然而實際情況是，比起一個理性的博士，一個永遠在線、永遠回覆、永遠不會不耐煩的 AI，往往更像剛需。它說的是不是真心話不重要，重要的是它一直在說。\n這大概就是 GPT-4o 能成為白月光的原因。在這個連表達關心都變得奢侈的時代，哪怕是 AI 的彩虹屁，也比真人的沉默更讓人心動。至少，它還願意回應你。\n本文來自微信公眾號「APPSO」，作者：發現明日產品的，36氪經授權發佈。",
