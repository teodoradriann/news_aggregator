After the mid-game interval, the Indian duo, Satwik-Chirag, edged ahead with a slight 18-14 lead.\nHowever, it didn't last much as the Chinese pair fought back, leveling the score to force a deuce and ultimately clinching the first game 24-22 after a fierce battle.\nThe second game followed a similar pattern, with Satwik-Chirag taking an early four-point lead, but they couldn’t hold on, allowing the Chinese duo to seize control and win 21-14, securing the match.\nMore to follow...",

    "text": "In a matter of minutes, flash floods caused by heavy downpours in eastern Spain on Tuesday swept away everything in their path. With no time to react, people were trapped in vehicles, homes and businesses. Many died and thousands saw livelihoods shattered.\nThree days later, authorities have recovered 205 bodies — 202 of them in the eastern Valencia region alone, two in Castilla La Mancha and one in Andalusia — and continue to search for an unknown number of missing people.\nWith warnings of more rain on the way, people are cleaning up the thick layers of mud that covered houses, streets and highways full of debris, all while facing power and water cuts and shortages of some basic goods. Inside some of the vehicles that the water washed into piles or crashed into buildings, there were still bodies waiting to be identified.\nHere are a few things to know about Spain’s deadliest storm in living memory:\nWhat happened? The storms concentrated over the Magro and Turia river basins and, in the Poyo riverbed, produced walls of water that overflowed riverbanks, catching people unaware as they went on with their daily lives, with many coming home from work on Tuesday evening.\nIn the blink of an eye, the muddy water covered roads, railways and entered houses and businesses in villages on the southern outskirts of Valencia city. Drivers, with their vehicles converted into boats, had to take shelter on car roofs, while residents tried to take refuge on higher ground.\nThe downpour was stunning. Spain’s national weather service said that in the hard-hit locality of Chiva it rained more in eight hours than it had in the preceding 20 months, calling the deluge “extraordinary.”\nWhen the authorities sent the alert to mobile phones warning of the seriousness of the phenomenon and asked them to stay at home, many were already on the road, working or covered in water in low-lying areas or garages, which became death traps .\nWhy did these massive flash floods happen? Scientists trying to explain what happened see two likely connections to human-caused climate change . One is that warmer air holds and then dumps more rain. The other is possible changes in the jet stream — the river of air above land that moves weather systems across the globe — that spawn extreme weather.\nClimate scientists and meteorologists said the immediate cause of the flooding is called a cut-off lower pressure storm system that migrated from an unusually wavy and stalled jet stream. That system simply parked over the region and poured rain. This happens often enough that in Spain they call them DANAs, the Spanish acronym for the system, meteorologists said.\nAnd then there is the unusually high temperature of the Mediterranean Sea. It had its warmest surface temperature on record in mid-August, at 28.47 degrees Celsius (83.25 degrees Fahrenheit), said Carola Koenig of the Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience at Brunel University of London.\nThe extreme weather event came after Spain battled with prolonged droughts in 2022 and 2023. Experts say that drought and flood cycles are increasing with climate change.\nHas this happened before? Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this episode was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory.\nOlder people in Paiporta, ground zero of the tragedy, claim that Tuesday’s floods were three times as bad as those of 1957, which caused at least 81 deaths and were the worst in the history of the tourist eastern region. That episode led to the diversion of the Turia watercourse, which meant that a large part of the city was spared of these floods.\nValencia suffered two other major DANAs in the 1980s, one in 1982, with around 30 deaths, and another one five years later, which broke rainfall records.\nThis week's flash floods are also Spain's deadliest natural tragedy in living memory, surpassing the flood that swept away a campsite along the Gallego river in Biescas, in the northwest, killing 87 people in August 1996.",

    "text": "Météo Fini la douceur, les températures vont brusquement chuter ce week-end Après le printemps précoce, l'hiver tardif... L'ambiance sera globalement fraîche, humide et venteuse, ce week-end. On va perdre jusqu'à 10 degrés en 24 heures. Avec des risques de gelées sur les cultures. Vous avez rangé les écharpes ? Il va falloir les ressortir... Car après la [remarquable douceur de cette semaine](/environnement/2024/03/14/pluies-orages-chaleur-quel-temps-fera-t-il-au-printemps), les températures vont dégringoler durant le week-end. Une semaine marquée par une grande douceur... Le printemps était bien au rendez-vous cette semaine. Mercredi, les températures ont même approché les 27 °C en Ariège, selon La Chaîne Météo. Les 25 °C ont par ailleurs été dépassés en Dordogne, en Corrèze et dans les Pyrénées-Atlantiques. Près de la Méditerranée, les températures ont également plusieurs fois atteint localement les 25 °C ces derniers jours, tandis que les 20 °C ont parfois gagné la moitié nord pour la première fois de l'année. Jeudi, il a encore fait 20 °C à Paris, 22 °C à Lyon, 21 °C à Clermont-Ferrand... Des températures au-dessus des normales de saison. En effet, selon La Chaîne Météo, la barre des 20 °C dans la capitale est en moyenne franchie le 30 mars. La douceur survient donc cette année avec 10 jours d'avance. Mais l'hiver n'a pas dit son dernier mot ! Ce vendredi devrait toutefois être la dernière journée durant laquelle vous allez pouvoir profiter de ce beau temps printanier, car une dégradation s'amorce... Et le week-end s'annonce, lui, nettement plus frais ! Au programme, des giboulées, et des averses, surtout au Nord et à l'Est, avec même le retour de la neige à basse altitude sur certains massifs montagneux. Les températures, elles, dégringolent. Avec par endroits jusqu'à 10 °C de différence entre vendredi et samedi, le mercure culminant entre 8 et 12 °C sur la moitié nord. Sur la moitié sud, le soleil sera plus généreux, mais le vent frais se lèvera en Méditerranée, avec notamment une forte tramontane. Faut-il craindre des gelées sur les cultures ? Après ce week-end agité, le ciel s’éclaircira rapidement dans la nuit de dimanche à lundi, favorisant la chute des températures nocturnes, et donc le risque de gelées, notamment dans le Centre-Est. Ce gel de printemps inquiète particulièrement les agriculteurs, car après un hiver anormalement doux (+2 °C par rapport aux normales, et même +3,5 °C sur le seul mois de février), la végétation est en avance... Toutefois, selon les dernières prévisions de La Chaîne Météo, le risque de gelées restera limité ce lundi, notamment en ce qui concerne les arbres fruitiers. Les prévisionnistes de La Chaîne Météo préviennent toutefois que le risque de gel existe toujours jusqu'à la fin du mois d'avril et même jusqu'en mai dans les régions proches des frontières du nord-est.",
