    "text": "Flamengo: Gabigol polemiza nas redes, e web aponta indireta a Mauro Cezar\nAtacante movimentou a internet na noite desta quarta-feira (25)\nLance!\nGabigol, do\nFlamengo, movimentou as redes sociais ao compartilhar uma declaração do jornalista Mauro Cezar Pereira no \"X\". O comentarista classificou a proposta de renovação do Rubro-Negro pelo jogador como \"exagerada\" e questionou os \"problemas\" do atacante. Após republicar a mensagem camisa 99, escreveu uma mensagem enigmática na web. ➡️Siga o Lance! Fora de Campo no WhatsApp e saiba o que rola fora das 4 linhas\n- Gabriel Barbosa tem uma proposta de renovação contratual. Uma proposta generosa (a meu ver exagerada até) se colocadas na balança suas muitas más atuações x raros bons momentos, como o de ontem. Sem falar nos problemas que protagonizou. Gabriel é quem não quer renovar com o Flamengo. Direito que o jogador tem - escreveu o jornalista.\n- Seis anos querendo atenção, vamos dar atenção há quem quer atenção (risos)! Para que está feio! - escreveu Gabigol, logo após republicar a mensagem de Mauro.\n➡️ Projete a tabela de classificação do Brasileirão com o simulador do Lance!\nApós a repercussão das mensagens de Gabigol, Mauro Cezar relembrou a entrevista de Júnior Pedroso, empresário do atacante, ao \"sportv\". Há cerca de um mês, o agente do centroavante afirmou que já \"trabalhava a saída de Gabigol\" do clube. O camisa 99 tem contrato com o Flamengo até o fim deste ano.\nTudo sobre",

    "text": "[VO Vets](https://vovets.com/), families can trust their furry family members will be handled with love and care. VO Vets, and its managing owner, Dr. Miller, has a simple mission: to provide warm, friendly pet care with less stress to families in and around Fort Worth. VO Vets combines a highly qualified team of veterinarians and support staff, quality care, and leading-edge technology to ensure pets are getting the best care possible. In addition, the clinic is committed to offering hours that are accessible to all pet owners. VO Vets is open 8 a.m.- 7 p.m. seven days a week, so even busy pet owners balancing work, school or kids can make sure their pets are happy and healthy—at a time that is most convenient for them. Meet Dr. Russell Miller Dr. Miller grew up on a small farm in Indiana surrounded by horses, cattle, dogs and cats. In grade school, he found himself competing in Future Farmers of America (FFA) events and even won the high school state division as an eighth grader. In his undergraduate tenure, he leaned into his passion for science, math, animals, people and agriculture and continued to learn more about animal health and veterinary medicine. After graduating, he was accepted into Purdue University where he settled on a veterinary specialty and became interested in the business side of the industry. Before opening VO Vets, Dr. Miller spent years working at two 24-hour emergency pet hospitals. When he was offered the chance to start his own business in Fort Worth, he knew it was time to take things to the next level. “VO Vets stands for veterinary ownership,” he said. “The idea is we're providing quality care and allow for each pet to essentially be treated as family members. Giving back to the community Dr. Miller said his goal at VO Vets is to provide a high-quality veterinary experience for both pets and people in the community. To fulfill his mission, Dr. Miller is dedicated to giving back to the Fort Worth community and sponsors multiple school sports teams, including Byron Nelson High School and Timber Creek High School. The animal hospital also partners with Keller ISD and Northwest ISD on Career and Technical Education (CTE) programming initiatives. The partnership with the schools' technical CTE programs allows high school students to work paid shadowing hours at VO Vets so they can graduate with a Certificate of Veterinary Assistance (CVA). Outside of Fort Worth, Dr. Miller also volunteers his veterinary services at The Iditarod, an annual long-distance sled dog race in Alaska. Providing excellent care At the end of the day, Dr. Miller’s top priority is to provide top-notch veterinary care. VO Vets offers a number of services to help keep pets happy and healthy, including: - wellness care - pet vaccinations - pet dental care - spay and neuter - walk-in and urgent care - parasite prevention In addition to taking excellent care of clients’ pets, Dr. Miller and his team also treat people with respect and grace. “We understand that people are sometimes having a bad day or worried about their loved ones,” he said. “And we try to coach the reception team and just the team in general, so that we can help them have a better day.” Learn more about VO Vets Dr. Miller said there are several talented veterinarians in the Fort Worth area, which motivates him and his staff to continually improve upon their services and convenience. Some of the ways VO Vets does this is by offering online scheduling services as well as a mobile app where clients can view their pets’ needs and book appointments. Overall, Dr. Miller said what truly makes VO Vets successful is being human and personable. “[People] just want you to have the best intentions for their loved ones,” he said. VO Vets is located at 12650 N Beach St., Ste. 148, Fort Worth. For more information, call 682-350-8890 or visit the [website](https://vovets.com/).

    "title": "WATCH: Palm Bay Man Escapes Vehicle Explosion, Saves Pets Inside Burning Home - Space Coast Daily",
    "text": "A Palm Bay man escaped a car fire on Monday and then ran into an inferno to save his pets. The home on Hallmark Street SE is a total loss, and the newly married couple is starting over from scratch. Blake Garrett’s BMW was parked in the garage, and he was sitting in the driver’s seat. When he tried to start it, he saw a flame spark from the hood, and the rest is history. The fire quickly engulfed the garage and spread to another car parked in the driveway. After Blake escaped the explosion, he didn’t run away from the fire. Instead, he ran inside to save what he could. “I was sitting in the driver’s seat when everything kicked off,” said Blake, showing FOX 35 around the home exclusively on Friday. He realizes days later how the flames could have been the end for him. “The only way I can explain it is a miracle, really. Five seconds more, and I wouldn’t be standing here today with you,” said Garrett. After narrowly missing death in the driveway, he put himself in danger again to save his three pets still trapped inside. CLICK HERE TO READ FULL ARTICLE ON FOX 35",

    "text": "La Contraloría General de la Repúblic a estableció, a comienzos de mes, que se deben aplicar descuentos en las remuneraciones de los docentes que participaron en el último paro (4 y 5 de junio), al tratarse de una \" ausencia de servidores públicos \" por \"adherir voluntariamente a una paralización irregular\". Y según el Colegio de Profesores, dicha reducción ya ha ocurrido. \"Me ha llegado la noticia de descuentos, que surgen del muy cuestionable oficio de la Contraloría General de la República\", asegura el presidente del gremio, Mario Aguilar. Por ello, afirma que \" la instrucción inmediata es que donde se concretó el descuento, no se accede a la recuperación (de clases). La recuperación solo procedería si es fuera de la jornada de trabajo, y asegurando que se van a reintegrar los fondos descontados\".\nLee más de esto en El Mercurio.",
