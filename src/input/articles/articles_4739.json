    "text": "If you or someone you know has plans to travel to Japan this summer and you’re even a little superstitious, there’s one date to look out for: July 5. A manga from the late 1990s eerily predicts past disasters, with that upcoming date now circled in red.\nThe author calls it her “dream journal,” and at least one airline has reported a significant drop in bookings around that time.\n‘The Future I Saw’ connects to past events\nIn 1999, manga artist Ryo Tatsuki published “Watashi ga Mita Mirai” (“The Future I Saw”), a book based on hundreds of her recorded dreams.\nHer first notable dream came in 1991. She saw a man with a brilliant personality and striking features who would soon die. Months later, British rock icon Freddie Mercury passed away — though some consider it coincidence.\nIn 1995, Tatsuki recorded a dream about a violent earthquake rocking her hometown of Kobe, Japan.\nOn Jan. 17 that year, a 6.9 magnitude quake struck the area. According to National Geographic, it killed 6,000 people and left 45,000 homeless.\nA shocking March 2011 prediction\nOne of her most chilling entries came in 1991, when she wrote, “a huge catastrophe will occur in March 2011.”\nThat prediction aligned with the 9.1 magnitude earthquake known as the “Great East Japan Earthquake” that struck on March 11, 2011. The resulting tsunami killed more than 16,000 people and left 2,500 missing.\nNow, a new date from Tatsuki’s dream journal is drawing attention.\nLocal Japanese media reports that she added “July 5, 2025” to the front cover of her book. Tatsuki has said she’s unsure if the date connects to a quake, but believed it was significant enough to highlight.\nAirlines report reduced demand\nIn a dream, Tatsuki reportedly saw the sea boiling south of Japan. She interpreted it as an underwater volcanic eruption that could trigger destruction.\nAnd while there’s no scientific basis for the claim, some travelers are taking note. According to one Japanese outlet, Greater Bay Airlines has seen a sharp drop in July 5 bookings.\n“We expected around 80 percent of the seats to be taken, but actual reservations came to only 40 percent,” said Hiroki Ito, general manager of Greater Bay Airlines.\nMultiple outlets report the airline has reduced flights around that date due to low demand.\nHowever, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways say they have not noticed any significant decrease in bookings.\nMeanwhile, feng shui master Qi Xian Yu has also predicted a year of natural disasters, including aviation accidents, and cautioned against traveling to countries like Japan and South Korea in 2025.\n“It would be a major problem if the spread of non-scientific rumors on social media had an effect on tourism,” said Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi Prefecture.\nIn an April 23 news conference, Gov. Murai emphasized that Japanese citizens are not fleeing the country and urged tourists to keep visiting.\nExperts say predictions are unreliable\nThe U.S. Geological Survey and other global scientific agencies maintain that no one can accurately predict major earthquakes.\n“We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future,” the agency stated.",

    "title": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände\"",
    "text": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände“\nEine Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz beschreibt bei Ippen.Media, woran es in Deutschlands Schulen fehlt - samt Forderungen an Kanzler Friedrich Merz.\nBerlin - Am Dienstag (24. Juni) war es so weit. Die schwarz-rote Bundesregierung aus CDU/CSU und SPD hat ihren Entwurf für den Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorgelegt. Darin sind im Umfeld von Ukraine-Krieg und Russland-Aggression nicht zuletzt immense Verteidigungsausgaben zur Aufrüstung der Bundeswehr enthalten.\nSchulen in Deutschland: Thema Bildung ging im Bundestagswahlkampf unter\nBis zu 95 Milliarden Euro sollen in die deutschen Streitkräfte fließen. Die Verteidigungspolitik war schließlich auch ein zentrales Thema im Wahlkampf zur Bundestagswahl 2025. Ganz im Gegensatz zur Bildung allgemein und zu Schulen im Speziellen. Dabei wird seit Jahren über eklatante Versäumnisse in der Ausstattung deutscher Bildungseinrichtungen berichtet.\nZum Beispiel bei ausreichend und zeitgemäßen digitalen Geräten. Im Umfeld von Bundeshaushalt und schwarz-roten Plänen für Deutschland hat die Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz auf Anfrage der Frankfurter Rundschau von Ippen.Media jetzt „gravierende Missstände“ benannt. Sie stellt eindringliche Forderungen an die Koalition von Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU) und Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil (SPD).\nBildung in Deutschland: Expertin berichtet von Missständen an deutschen Schulen\n„Die Missstände an deutschen Schulen sind vielerorts gravierend und sie ziehen sich durch nahezu alle Bereiche: Vom akuten Lehrkräftemangel, über unzureichende digitale Infrastruktur bis hin zu baulichen Mängeln, die zum Teil gesundheitsgefährdend sind. Es ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schülerinnen und Schüler in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden“, erklärt Tilda Skerra – „Wenn überhaupt Lehrkräfte zur Verfügung stehen“. Digitale Endgeräte würden ebenso fehlen wie stabiles WLAN oder zeitgemäße Lernumgebungen, schildert sie.\nSkerra ist Mitglied im Bundessekretariat der Bundesschülerkonferenz (BSK), die sich als Vertretung von Schülerinnen und Schülern der Bildungspolitik in Deutschland annimmt. Und zwar bei Themen von überregionaler Bedeutung. So sollen Anliegen von Schülern und Schülerinnen bundesweit Gehör verschafft werden, während für das Thema Bildung im deutschen Föderalismus vorrangig die Bundesländer zuständig sind.\nEs ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schüler*innen in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden.\nDie Kulturhoheit der Länder im Bildungsbereich ist im Grundgesetz verankert. Der Bund nimmt durch Fördermittel und Subventionen, etwa bei Bauvorhaben, aber sehr wohl erheblichen Einfluss auf die Bildungspolitik und kann die Länder je nach Gewichtung des Themas bei der Budgetierung erheblich entlasten - oder eben nicht.\nSondervermögen der schwarz-roten Koalition: Schüler-Vertreter fordern viel mehr Geld von Merz\nNach Ansicht von Skerra und ihrer Mitstreiter kommen aus Berlin zu wenige Signale und vor allem zu wenig Geld, um frühere Versäumnisse anzugehen und bestenfalls zu beheben. „Wir fordern, dass mindestens zehn Prozent des geplanten Infrastruktur-Sondervermögens, also rund 50 Milliarden Euro, zweckgebunden in die Sanierung und Modernisierung von Schulen investiert werden“, erklärt Skerra unserer Redaktion. „Darüber hinaus braucht es ein langfristig angelegtes Förderprogramm, das die bauliche, digitale und strukturelle Weiterentwicklung unserer Schulen strategisch begleitet.“\nFerner müsse der schon unter der früheren Ampel-Bundesregierung so bezeichnete „DigitalPakt deutlich aufgestockt und ausgebaut werden, um Bildung endlich nachhaltig im 21. Jahrhundert anzukommen zu lassen“, meint die Expertin. Zu weiteren Forderungen der Bundesschülerkonferenz gehört die Sicherstellung der Finanzierung von verpflichtenden Fort- und Weiterbildungsbereichen, was etwa die Themen „mentale Gesundheit“ und „digitale Lehrformate“ betreffe. Und ein realistischer Betreuungsschlüssel, wie es die BSK-Sprecherin beschreibt: „Mindestens eine Schulsozialarbeiterin oder ein Schulsozialarbeiter auf 300 Schüler*innen und auf 150 Schüler*innen eine Schulpsychologin oder ein Schulpsychologe je Bundesland.“\nLars Klingbeil stellt Bundeshaushalt 2025 vor: Bildungsausgaben steigen leicht\nDas alles gebe es bislang nicht. Die Investitionen in die Bildung, die Vize-Kanzler Klingbeil im Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorstellte, dürften bei den Experten aus dem Bereich jedoch für überschaubare Begeisterung sorgen. Laut Website des Bundesfinanzministeriums entfallen von 488,60 Milliarden Euro aus dem Regierungsentwurf gerade mal 4,57 Prozent auf die Themen Bildung und Forschung - rund 22,31 Milliarden Euro.\nDas ist ein leichter Anstieg. Zum Vergleich: Die gescheiterte Ampel-Bundesregierung hatte für 2024 noch 21,49 Milliarden Euro eingeplant. Laut Bundesfinanzministerium sollen aus dem Sondervermögen zudem insgesamt 6,5 Milliarden Euro in Investitionen für die Kindertagesbetreuung und in die digitale Bildung fließen. In einem Zeitraum bis 2029. Von den geforderten 50 Milliarden Euro der BSK ist das weit entfernt. (pm)",

    "title": "UN attacks Africa for attitudes towards abortion",
    "text": "Iulia Elena Cazan (ZENIT News – [Center for Family and Human Rights](https://c-fam.org/) / Nueva York, 12.28.2023).- International abortion groups and UN agencies are influencing the development of massive propaganda programs in Africa. With government officials, they are carrying out large-scale advocacy campaigns to include abortion as an essential health service. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) released a [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/unlocking-future-advancing-universal-sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights-within-universal-health-coverage-east-and-southern-africa) committed to coupling health services and abortion in Southeast Africa and that no country in that region, such as Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Malawi among others, will be able to attain universal health care without universal sexual and reproductive care. The report admits that access to contraception, pregnancy care, and HIV treatments are already partially included in many universal health care packages in that region. Still, UN agencies push for the inclusion of abortion access and comprehensive sexuality education as “essential” components of health care. To ensure widespread abortion access in the region, the report recommends “strengthening the digital health ecosystem and related self-care interventions.” Earlier this year, the WHO [launched a mobile app](https://unric.org/en/who-comprehensive-abortion-care-tool-mobile-app/) to help healthcare providers offer better abortion “care” to pregnant women. The app “takes the individual characteristics of patients and generates patient-specific assessments or recommendations” and helps facilitate remote patient support to “assist” women while performing abortions at home. The WHO-UNFPA report also shared that a crucial factor in ensuring “comprehensive sexual reproductive health care” is conducting “value clarification” work for providers. This kind of work attempts to “destigmatize” abortion among medical personnel and encourage them to perform abortions. It is clear that many medical personnel in Africa oppose abortion. Ipas, an international organization whose expressed purpose is to promote abortion all over the world, has a full curriculum on this, the Ipas Values Clarification for Action and Transformation (VCAT), and uses it to knock down medical and religious beliefs about abortion across Africa. In a recent [press release](https://www.ipas.org/news/in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-policymakers-commit-to-including-abortion-in-universal-health-coverage/), Ipas claimed victory in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Comprehensive abortion care is now included in the universal health program and boasted that it was one of the key factors in making this happen. Such policy change did not come about solely by mobilizing civil society organizations. Ipas offered SRH training to government officials, including the DRC Health Ministry personnel. Ipas said it was able to find supporters inside the government. It is clear that money played a huge role in the shift. The Ipas director in the Congo said as much, “the existing government budget is unable to finance integrating abortion care…Ipas is working to secure this missing funding.” It is likely the missing funding came from the Biden administration. While celebrating Universal Health Coverage Day, Ipas said that “a powerful joint statement signed by 60 countries emerged from the United Nations General Assembly in September that calls for sexual and reproductive health and rights to be an essential component of UHC.” This was not a document of the UN General Assembly, however. An international right to abortion has never emerged from the General Assembly and a significant number of UN members consistently delivered statements at the UN clarifying that they do not consider the term “sexual and reproductive health and rights” as to include abortion.",

    "title": "Tories ‘writing off’ young people as growing number ‘economically inactive’ – The Irish News",
    "text": "The Tories are “writing off” young people, Labour has said, with the number of young people out of work due to “long-term sickness” doubling since 2010. Sir Keir Starmer’s party said that in 2010/11, there were 116,000 16 to 24-year-olds out of work or not looking for employment due to long-term sickness. The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for the whole of the UK now puts this number at 235,000 people out of work, the party said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: “By neglecting the foundations needed for a healthy economy, the Tories are writing off hundreds of thousands of young people.” The Labour MP said her party would ensure young people do not fall between the cracks between services and Government departments. It hopes that improving mental health services, as well as reducing NHS waiting lists and strengthening workers’ rights, will help tackle the “root causes” of economic inactivity. Ms Kendall said: “Labour will tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, including the mental health crisis facing so many of our young people. “We will transform mental health services, drive down NHS waiting lists, boost skills, bolster employment rights and provide tailored job support.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride have both sought to get people of all ages back into the workplace, in a bid to boost labour supply across the UK. The proportion of people out of work rose since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, but the issue is also seen to be caused by a broader set of factors including rising disability and long-term sickness levels. A Government spokesperson said: “We are driving down inactivity and helping young people into work as we build on our track record of youth unemployment falling by 43% since 2010. “We are investing £2.3 billion into mental health services and supporting more 16 and 17-year-olds to participate in education and apprenticeships. “More widely our Back to Work Plan will help up to 1.1 million people with long-term health conditions, disabilities or long-term unemployed to look for and stay in work.” A Conservative spokesman accused Labour of having a “brass neck”, saying the party had “never left office with unemployment lower than what they inherited”.",
