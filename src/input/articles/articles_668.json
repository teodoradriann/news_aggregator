    "text": "--All CIT patients maintained platelet counts >75 x 10 9 /L at 1-week following chemotherapy plus a single dose of SCB-219M, with durable responses through at least 3-weeks--\n--Durable efficacy and PK profile expected to support convenient dosing interval of ≥2-weeks, compared to daily or weekly dosing for current treatment options in China [1] and globally [2] --\n--Phase Ⅰ b trial in CIT and CTIT (cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia) patients evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M is planned to initiate in 2024--\nCHENGDU, China , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Clover; HKEX: 02197), a global commercial-stage biotechnology company, today announced positive preliminary safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics data in a Phase Ⅰ clinical trial evaluating SCB-219M, an innovative thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) mimetic bispecific Fc-fusion protein produced from CHO cells, for the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).\nAll cancer patients enrolled to-date (n=9) receiving chemotherapy plus a single subcutaneous dose of SCB-219M observed platelet counts maintained or recovered at >75 x 10 9 /L (threshold level for CIT) after one week, with responses durable through at least three weeks (i.e. through the chemotherapy cycle). In comparison, following administration of the same chemotherapy (but without SCB-219M) in the same cancer patients prior to enrolling into the trial, all evaluable patients had observed platelet counts drop to <75 x 10 9 /L between one and three weeks. The durable preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile observed for SCB-219M are potentially supportive of dosing intervals ≥2-weeks. If further confirmed, this profile could enable convenient dosing of SCB-219M synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen, typically 2-3 weeks per cycle. A favorable safety and tolerability profile for SCB-219M has also been observed to-date, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) identified.\nDr. Yongsheng Wang , Associate Director of West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University and Principal Investigator for the SCB-219M Phase Ⅰ Trial commented: \"We are encouraged by the Phase Ⅰ results to-date for SCB-219M, and we look forward to the continued evaluation of SCB-219M, as we believe the management of CIT remains a pressing unmet medical need for patients undergoing cancer treatment.\"\n\"We are pleased to announce positive Phase Ⅰ results for SCB-219M demonstrating rapid and durable efficacy along with a favorable safety profile,\" said Dr. Peng Liang , Chairman, Chief Scientific Officer of Clover and inventor of SCB-219M. \"The preliminary results suggest that SCB-219M has a potentially differentiated profile compared to the current standard of care treatments for CIT and CTIT. In contrast to current biologic treatment options for CIT in China requiring daily injections [1] and globally requiring weekly injections [2] , the durable efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SCB-219M observed to-date could enable convenient dosing synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen.\"\nThe Phase Ⅰ trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study, that is exploring the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SCB-219M administered subcutaneously in cancer patients with CIT. In addition to West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University, other participating sites in this clinical trial include Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital and Chengdu No. 6 People's Hospital. A Phase Ⅰb trial evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M in CIT and CTIT patients is planned to initiate in 2024.\nCIT is a serious, chemotherapy-associated complication observed in a wide range of cancer patients. Incidence of CIT can occur in greater than 50% [3] of patients undergoing standard chemotherapy regiments, and can have detrimental impacts on treatment outcome, resulting in chemotherapy dose delay or dose reduction, and potentially fatal bleeding events.\n1.

    "text": "Bengaluru, June 23: Space agency ISRO on Sunday said it has achieved a third consecutive success in the Reusable Launch Vehicle Landing Experiment by demonstrating the autonomous landing capability of the launch vehicle under more challenging conditions. This mission simulated the approach and landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space, reaffirming the Indian Space Research Organisation&#039;s (ISRO) expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), the space agency said. The third and final test in the series of Landing Experiment (LEX-03) was conducted at 07:10 1ST at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) in Chitradurga, Karnataka. Following the success of the RLV LEX-01 and LEX-02 missions, ISRO in a release said, RLV LEX-03 re-demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV under more challenging release conditions (cross range of 500 m against 150 m for LEX-02) and more severe wind conditions. PM Modi Kerala Visit: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Inaugurates Three Major Space Infrastructure Projects of ISRO During his visit to Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. The winged vehicle, named &#039;Pushpak&#039;, was released from an Indian Air Force Chinook Helicopter at an altitude of 4.5 km &quot;from a release point 4.5 km away from the runway. Pushpak autonomously executed cross-range correction manoeuvres, approached the runway and performed a precise horizontal landing at the runway centreline,&quot; it said. Due to this vehicle&#039;s low lift-to-drag ratio aerodynamic configuration, the landing velocity exceeded 320 kmph, compared to 260 kmph for a commercial aircraft and 280 kmph for a typical fighter aircraft, it added. ISRO said, after touchdown, the vehicle velocity was reduced to nearly 100 kmph using its brake parachute, after which the landing gear brakes were employed for deceleration and stop on the runway. During this ground roll phase, Pushpak utilises its rudder and nose wheel steering system to autonomously maintain a stable and precise ground roll along the runway, it said. According to the space agency, this mission simulated the approach and landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space, reaffirming ISRO&#039;s expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). Through this mission, the advanced guidance algorithm catering to longitudinal and lateral plane error corrections, which is essential for the future Orbital Re-entry Mission has been validated, the space agency noted.

The mission received significant support from the Indian Air Force, Aeronautical Development Establishment, Aerial Delivery Research and Development Establishment, Regional Centre for Military Airworthiness under Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification, National Aerospace Laboratories, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Indian aerospace industrial partners, Indian Oil Corporation of India and Airport Authority of India. S Somanath, Chairman, ISRO/Secretary, Department of Space, congratulated the team for their efforts in maintaining the success streak in such complex missions. Dr S Unnikrishnan Nair, Director of VSSC, emphasised that this consistent success boosts ISRO&#039;s confidence in the critical technologies essential for future orbital re-entry missions. J Muthupandian is the Mission Director and B Karthik is the Vehicle Director for this successful mission.

    "text": "Los municipios que componen la región de Caguas son los más afectados, a las 3:25 p.m., según datos de LUMA Energy 15 de agosto de 2024 - 6:39 AM Los municipios que componen la región de Caguas son los más afectados, a las 3:25 p.m., según datos de LUMA Energy 15 de agosto de 2024 - 6:39 AM Un total de 366,564 clientes del consorcio energético [LUMA Energy](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/luma-energy/) continúan este jueves sin el servicio eléctrico, un día después del paso cercano de lo que era la [tormenta tropical Ernesto](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/tormenta-tropical-ernesto/), ahora huracán de categoría 1. A las 3:25 p.m. del jueves, el portal de estatus de servicio del consorcio LUMA Energy detallaba que 366,564 clientes estaban sin electricidad. Esto equivale al 24.97% del universo de abonados (1,468,223), según los datos actualizados. A lo largo de la mañana y tarde se ha reportado una disminución en la cifra reportada por el consorcio, al compararlo con los 482,033 clientes que no tenían servicio a las 6:00 de la mañana. La región más afectada, a las 3:25 p.m., por la interrupción de servicios es Caguas con 93,028 abonados sin luz. Le sigue Carolina, con 76,263 abonados a oscuras, y luego Mayagüez, con 76,034. Desde el miércoles, la región de Caguas había sido la más impactada por los apagones por más de 24 horas. La región menos afectada, a las 3:35 p.m., era Bayamón, donde 10,785 clientes no tienen servicio. El miércoles, más de 700,000 abonados llegaron a estar sin servicio energético a causa de los efectos del sistema tropical, casi la mitad de los clientes. El presidente del consorcio energético que está a cargo de la transmisión y distribución de la red eléctrica, Juan Saca, había advertido por los pasados días que se experimentarían interrupciones eléctricas durante el paso cercano de Ernesto, lo que se atribuye a la fragilidad del sistema. El miércoles en la tarde, este [no pudo precisar cuándo se podría restablecer](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/notas/luma-energy-no-precisa-cuando-se-reestablecera-el-servicio-electrico/) el servicio en su totalidad. “Todavía no (podemos indicar cuánto tiempo tomaría) porque no quiero ser irresponsable. Se han identificado 22 estructuras que fueron dañadas, pero no hemos encontrado ninguna situación catastrófica”, sostuvo Saca. Este indicó que hoy, jueves, retomarán los trabajos de evaluación, incluso con la asistencia de naves provistas por la Guardia Nacional. Las brigadas de campo de LUMA Energy [comenzaron el miércoles a inspeccionar los daños](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/notas/brigadas-de-luma-energy-inspeccionan-lineas-de-transmision-ante-los-danos-causados-por-la-tormenta-ernesto/) provocados desde la noche del martes por el paso de la tormenta tropical Ernesto. “Un poquito antes de las 11:00 a.m., ya nuestras brigadas estaban saliendo a hacer las primeras inspecciones de campo. Esto quiere decir que, en la medida que mejoren las condiciones del tiempo, continuaremos despachando brigadas para hacer las inspecciones y evaluaciones de daño iniciales y comenzarán las reparaciones”, sostuvo Hugo Sorrentini, director de comunicaciones de LUMA. Sorrentini precisó, más temprano el miércoles, que se habían contabilizado cerca de 35 líneas de transmisión eléctrica con segmentos fuera de servicio. La mayoría de ellas, dijo el oficial de prensa, son líneas de 38 kilovoltios (kV), las de menor voltaje en el sistema de transmisión, que también cuenta con líneas de 115 y 230 kV, que son las que se interconectan directamente a las centrales de generación. Una de las líneas de 38 kV que [salió de servicio fue la 4800](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/notas/sale-de-servicio-la-linea-4800-critica-para-el-suministro-electrico-en-municipios-del-sur/), que electrifica a los municipios de Aibonito, Coamo y Santa Isabel, y ha estado bajo la lupa ante los problemas que ha experimentado la subestación de este último municipio desde inicios de junio. Entre los cables de 230 kV, Sorrentini detalló que solo se había identificado una avería, en la línea 50800, que discurre entre Yabucoa y Sabana Llana, en Carolina.

    "text": "En la búsqueda de bajar de peso , es probable que algunas personas vean fácil el hecho de dejar de comer sin tener le supervisión de un médico o especialista en temas de nutrición, por eso es importante conocer los pros y contras de este método, el cual debería realizarse de forma correcta y recibe en algunos casos el nombre del ayuno intermitente.\nEl cuerpo humano está capacitado para sobrevivir varias horas, días e incluso semanas sin comer, pero esto no quiere decir que sea algo positivo para la salud. Son muchas las personas que buscan modificar su aspecto físico por presión social, según los expertos , sin orientarse de una fuente confiable.\nDejar de comer de forma abrupta traerá insatisfacción y será todo un sacrificio sin mucho sentido, pues se ha comprobado que algunos al volver a comer, simplemente recuperan los kilos perdidos, sin ningún buen resultado, como le pasó a Peter Bowes, periodista de la BBC, quien en 2014 se sometió a un ensayo clínico de ayuno intermitente.\n“Al terminar cada ciclo de ayuno de cinco días, en los que comía alrededor de un cuarto de la dieta de una persona promedio, perdía entre 2 y 4 kilos. Al comer normalmente durante 25 días, sin embargo, volvía a mi peso original”, contó.\nSegún, un artículo publicado en Journal of Food Science and Nutrition en 2018 , al no comer se van desencadenando progresivamente una serie de procesos orgánicos perjudiciales para la salud a los que vale la pena prestar atención.\nEfectos mentales Diferentes expertos han afirmado que la alimentación influye en la salud mental y el bienestar , por eso pueden causar diferentes efectos.\nLe puede interesar:\nRecomendaciones de un médico para adelgazar en el 2024 Rutina japonesa para bajar de peso con solo cinco minutos al día La doctora Suzanne Dickson, de Universidad de Gotemburgo, en Suecia, y autora principal de la descripción más actualizada en el nuevo campo de la Psiquiatría Nutricional afirmó que han encontrado que existe “una creciente evidencia de un vínculo entre una dieta pobre y el empeoramiento de los trastornos del estado de ánimo, incluida la ansiedad y la depresión”, sin embargo, recalca que no hay evidencia solida sobre los efectos de ciertos alimentos en la salud.\nEfectos físicos El doctor Calos Fabian Ávila afirma que al dejar de comer se dejan de aportar los carbohidratos que se convierten en glucosa y alimentan las células. Aunque hasta 6 horas después de no comer el cuerpo puede funcionar como lo hace normalmente.\nSi se suspenden comidas como el desayuno se deja sin glucosa el cerebro y funciones cognitivas como la memorización se verán afectadas. Después de 7 horas sin comer, pueden verse cambios de humor, distracción y reducción de las capacidades cognitivas.\nSi ya son 72 horas sin comer, es decir, 3 días, el organismo comienza a buscar otros elementos que pueda convertir en glucosa y como consecuencia se evidencia un empeoramiento de las funciones cognitivas como:\nProblemas de concentración. Problemas de memoria. Se pierde capacidad de reacción. Experimentos realizados sobre 72 horas de ayuno han indicado que este influye directamente en el neurometabolismo.\nA partir de 3 día hasta el 7, en las mujeres puede ocasionar alteración de su ciclo menstrual, pérdida de densidad ósea y disminución del apetito sexual.",
