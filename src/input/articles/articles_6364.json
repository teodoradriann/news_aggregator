    "title": "All Christians doubt, but scandals are testing my faith in the Church",
    "text": "Oh Lord. Just as I was sitting down to write something about the 1,700th anniversary of the Nicene Creed, this happens. Another scandal, another all-too-credible account of abuse in the Church of England, yet another story suppressed for the sake of the reputation of the institution. By the time this column is printed, that scandal will have been succeeded by a new one; each changing place with that which goes before. I wouldn’t say that Jeffrey John’s prayer for the church from 2001 has supplanted the Lord’s Prayer in the top 10 Prayers Most Prayed, but it must be getting close:\nLord, do something about your Church.\nIt is so awful; it is hard not to feel ashamed of belonging to it.\nMost of the time it seems to be all the things you condemned:\nhierarchical, conventional, judgemental, hypocritical,\nrespectable, comfortable, moralising, compromising,\nclinging to its privileges and worldly securities,\nand when not positively objectionable, merely absurd…\nEvery Sunday in church we stand, look to the east, towards Jerusalem, and say the Nicene Creed. Every single week we say in one voice what we believe about God, about Jesus, about creation and redemption and the Holy Spirit, and about what will ultimately become of each one of us.\nWhen the service is Common Worship, we begin the creed with the words, “We believe in one God…” It’s “I believe…” at the earlier service. If you’re at a sung mass and hear it in Latin, it begins Credo in unum Deum. I believe. That “I” is a corporate “I”, the voice of the Church for the last 1,700 years. It’s okay: you can still come to church and receive the sacraments if you’re not certain you, personally, believe every word. When you stand up and speak, you’re joining with the body who has proclaimed this creed through the ages. What is belief except holding on, trusting things we can’t prove? The creed doesn’t require us to believe that everything in the Bible is historically verifiable, nor that since Adam’s fall all humanity is subject to God’s wrath and condemnation. It does ask us to say we believe that Jesus is completely human and completely God, the original theological victory that led to the creation of the creed. And even this bedrock assertion invites wonder as soon as it is made.\nThis is just as well, because people have always had doubts and strange notions. Even theologians have doubts and strange notions. Out in the parishes, very few people, for instance, seem to believe in the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. The resurrection of the dead? What would that entail? Imagine a parish visit. I am having tea with two children, their mother and the cat. “They wonder whether Jesus might have been in a coma, or unconscious, and came round in the tomb,” their mother tells me. “Many people have wondered that over the centuries,” I begin, and then try to talk about how different the dead are from the living; how very, very different when you see them and touch them. We talk about how the disciples thought they were seeing a ghost, and Jesus asking for something to eat to prove he wasn’t. In the end, we decide, it’s a mystery, like so many things in the universe.\nSome people tend towards materialism, some towards spiritualism. Most people in my parishes want to be buried next to their kin, not so that they will all rise together when time shall be no more, but so that their bodies will repose forever in the same chalk and clay. Some believe in reincarnation. Some believe that we are entirely spirit. The church fends off heresy with the creed and the people go out with their own beliefs. Did God create everything? Even wasps? Is everything that happens God’s will? How does that work then? Doing theology on the hoof is a lot more exciting for me than doing it in the university. And yet if I hadn’t spent a lot of time in the university, could I manage to visit and preach in these parishes? I’m thinking now of the student in a seminar who said, outraged, “I can’t go back to my people and tell them that the resurrection is just a symbol!” “What do you mean, ‘just a symbol?”’ retorted the professor, a Missionary Oblate of Mary Immaculate. “Symbols are all we have. Symbols are what we are. Christ is the symbol of God. We are the symbols of Christ.” Which brings me back to Jeffrey John’s prayer, which goes on:\nLord, we need you to overturn the tables, judge us and cleanse us,\nchallenge and change us,\nbreak and remake us.\nHelp us to be what you called us to be.\nHelp us to embody you on earth.\nHelp us to make you real down here,\nand to feed your people bread instead of stones.\nAnd start with me.",

    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard commemorated her first full day of freedom with a selfie. She took to Instagram Friday to mark her release from prison by snapping a quick pic of her smiling, writing “First selfie of freedom!” in the caption. Blanchard, who conspired with her then-boyfriend Nick Godejohn to kill her abusive mother in 2015 , was released from prison early Thursday morning. She pled guilty to a second-degree murder charge on Tuesday, July 5, 2016 and served about 85% of her 10-year sentence, spending a total of eight years behind bars for her role in the murder. She became eligible for parole in September. Blanchard also recently announced the release of an eBook titled “Release,” set to come out on Jan. 9. Here’s what we know about Gypsy Rose Blanchard. Gypsy Rose Blanchard coverage: Gypsy Rose Blanchard's release from prison latest twist in shocking Munchausen by Proxy case Gypsy Rose Blanchard , who is Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard’s daughter, was made to believe she suffered from a wide range of medical ailments including leukemia, asthma and muscular dystrophy thanks to her mother. Gypsy’s late mother was accused of having made her daughter appear to have a range of physical and developmental ailments, USA Today previously reported. Dee Dee Blanchard, later said to have Munchausen syndrome by proxy which is a mental condition in which someone makes another person ill for sympathy or gain received disability payments and gifts from charities all of Gypsy’s illnesses, that often led to painful treatment and procedures. Gypsy, who used a wheelchair before it was discovered she could walk , said she was desperate to escape her mother's abuse and sought help from her online boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn. Godejohn, who was was sentenced to life in prison for stabbing and killing Dee Dee Blanchard, traveled to Missouri on June 9, 2015 to help enact the escape plan. He was reportedly let into the home after Gypsy’s late mother fell asleep and used a knife handed to him by Gypsy to stab the sleeping woman 17 times, killing her before fleeing to his native Wisconsin, USA Today previously reported. Gypsy later told ABC 20/20 news she hid in the bathroom with hands over her ears during the act. Authorities were contacted about a post on Dee Dee Blanchard’s Facebook page dated June 14, 2015 that read, ‘That B*** is dead!’ before her body was found in her home with multiple stab wounds. Before Gypsy was publicly tied to the murder, many Springfield residents were worried that she was also in peril. The bizarre nature of the Springfield murder made national headlines and became the subject of documentaries and streamed television series . Gypsy and her boyfriend were arrested on June 14, 2015 in Big Bend, Wisconsin. The pair posted two updates on Dee Dee Blanchard’s Facebook page earlier that day to draw attention to her yet undiscovered body. Gypsy Rose Blanchard was born July 29, 1991, making her 32 years old in 2023. Dee Dee Blanchard was born May 3, 1967, making her 48 years old when she was killed in 2015.

    "title": "Fertility Crisis: 40 Million Tons of Grain Lost",
    "text": "Argentina Crop Nutrition Crisis: Millions of Tons Lost Annually BUENOS AIRES — May 9, 2024 — A crisis is unfolding in Argentina as the agricultural sector grapples with significant crop losses due to inefficient fertilization practices. The primary issue is inefficiencies, according to experts who cite a lack of proper soil diagnosis which impacts yields, and leads to a loss of millions of tons of grains annually. Addressing soil management is key; read on.\nArgentina Grapples With Crop Nutrition Crisis: millions of Tons Lost Annually rosario, Argentina – A stark assessment presented at the Fertilizad 2025 symposium has revealed that Argentina’s agricultural sector is losing approximately 40 million tons of grains annually due to inefficient fertilization practices.Despite increased fertilizer usage, critical gaps in soil management and nutrient investment continue to plague the nation’s crop yields.\nThe Root of the Problem: Lack of Soil Diagnosis The symposium,organized by the Fertilizar association,highlighted that inadequate soil diagnosis and insufficient investment in essential nutrients are primary drivers of poor crop nutrition. Roberto Rotandaro,president of Fertilizar AC ,emphasized the urgency of addressing these issues,stating that crop nutrition will be key in the next campaign.\nDid you know? Only 21% of agricultural operations in Argentina conduct nutrient analysis on their soils. This lack of data hinders effective fertilization strategies. Economic Impact and Lost Potential The consequences of poor fertilization extend beyond crop yields, significantly impacting the Argentine economy. Rotandaro pointed out that around 40 million tons of grains ceased to occur due to inefficiency in fertilization. This represents a ample loss of potential revenue and underscores the need for improved soil management practices.\nKey Deficiencies and Opportunities for Enhancement Sulfur Deficiency: Rotandaro noted that the average dose of sulfur today remains just 2 to 3 kilos per hectare. He stressed that sulfur is an economic and efficient nutrient and that increasing its application presents a meaningful prospect for improvement. Corn Production: Gaps in nutrient application are particularly pronounced in corn crops, highlighting the need for targeted fertilization strategies. Pro Tip: Conduct regular soil testing to determine specific nutrient deficiencies. Tailor your fertilization plan based on these results to maximize crop yield and minimize waste. Fertilizer Market Dynamics Argentina’s fertilizer market relies heavily on imports. Rotandaro explained that the country produces a third of the fertilizer that it uses, and the rest is mainly imported from North Africa, the United States, Morocco and Russia. The majority of these imports enter through the port of San Nicolás, followed by San Lorenzo and Rosario.\nThe Role of Advisors and Thorough Soil Management Rotandaro emphasized the critical role of agricultural advisors in disseminating knowledge and promoting effective soil management. He stated that the advisor has to filter and hierarchize the most relevant technologies, based on diagnosis and understand the diversity of the Argentine producer. He also cautioned against focusing solely on nitrogen and phosphorus, urging a broader outlook that includes addressing issues like water and wind erosion, compaction, and flooding.

    "title": "10 TV Shows About Narcissists and Psychopaths That Will Leave You Breathless",
    "text": "Some television series capture narcissism and psychopathy so well they leave us breathlessly captivated – revealing the ruthless pursuit of power at all costs, predators who are wolves in sheep’s clothing, and cunning manipulators who hide behind masks. While narcissism involves a lack of empathy, a grandiose sense of self and an excessive sense of entitlement, psychopathy goes further, yielding a lack of remorse and even at times sadistic violence. Here are the ten television shows you should watch if you want to see the traits and behaviors of narcissism and psychopathy fleshed out mesmerizingly on screen. Game of Thrones The race for power in Game of Thrones brought all the narcissists to the Westeros yard. Based on George R.R. Martin’s captivating fantasy novels, A Song of Ice and Fire , this HBO drama series adapted for the screen by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss received record-breaking views over the span of its eight seasons, following a war for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Whether it’s the psychopathic Cersei Lannister plotting and scheming to kill people to secure her power in the North (including her own daughter-in-law, Margaery Tyrell) and beheading people like Missandei in front of her beloved friend Daenerys or the cruel Ramsay Bolton who rapes Sansa Stark and forces her brother’s friend Theon to watch, there is no shortage of sadistic psychopathic and narcissistic traits and actions displayed in the characters in the pursuit of power. Even the ones who are targeted – such as powerful characters like Arya Stark and Daenerys who fight back due to the traumas they have experienced – also engage in violence because they have been harmed by predators throughout their lives, albeit to a different extent.\nHouse of Cards In House of Cards, Frank Underwood is a ruthless psychopathic politician who weaponizes deception and murder to rise in the ranks from the United States House of Representatives all the way to U.S president. Underwood manipulates and deceives many people including his own friends, and even signs off on the deaths of his employees. House of Cards is a chilling portrait of a Machiavellian psychopath who is willing to do anything for power. Ironically, Kevin Spacey, who played Frank Underwood is said to be the real-life Frank as he has been accused of sexual assault by four different accusers and conspiracy theorists have suggested he may be possibly involved in the mysterious crimes involving his accusers.\nSuccession The critically acclaimed television HBO series Succession follows media mogul Logan Roy, the founder of a multi-billion dollar company and his adult children Shiv, Roman, and Kendall, all of whom manipulate others to rise to corporate power. Whether it is Logan sadistically pitting his own children against each other, promising them positions at his company or his son Kendall Roy making false promises to others to get the upperhand in deals, or his daughter Shiv Roy sabotaging her own husband Tom Wambsgans and setting him up to fail to establish a closer relationship with her father, the show runs rampant with scheming narcissists and psychopaths who plot to maintain the upper-hand.\nBreaking Bad The crime drama series Breaking Bad tracks the trajectory of the infamous Walter White, a former chemist who starts using his skills to manufacture and sell meth to gain financial security for his family when he is diagnosed with a life-threatening condition. Walter becomes more and more ruthless as he rises to the top, becoming one of the most dangerous drug lords of the Southwestern drug trade and adopting a new alias, “Heisenberg.” Breaking Bad highlights the grandiosity of narcissism and the lack of empathy as murder and lying become second nature to Walter and he begins blaming others for his own faults and betraying his loved ones, losing sight of the initial intention of getting into this seedy business. His narcissism becomes more blatant throughout the show but some psychologists have suggested these traits were present from the beginning and were only exacerbated over time by his circumstances.\n“Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn’t believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears. It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!” – Walter White’s grandiose speech to his wife Skylar Law and Order: SVU Law and Order: SVU spans over 23 seasons, bursting with episodes featuring predatory narcissists and psychopaths. This is one of the few shows where victims often get justice and perpetrators get held accountable. Many fans find comfort in empathic detective Olivia Benson reminding many victims it was not their fault, as well as in the show’s resident psychologist, Dr. George Huang, skillfully diagnosing the perpetrators as narcissists and psychopaths. Some notable episodes exploring malignant narcissism and gaslighting include: Born Psychopath and its sequel Post-Graduate Psychopath, Behave, Motherly Love, Annihilated, Doubt, and Surrender Benson.\nDexter Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst by day and a serial killer of serial killers and rapists by night. The quintessential “sympathetic” vigilante psychopath, Dexter still exhibits many disturbing psychopathic qualities like the ability to lie seamlessly, cruelty to animals at a young age, cheat on his partners, and his ability to take sadistic pleasure and show no remorse in murdering predators. He has an elaborate ritual for killing which ensures he leaves no trace, and is cool under pressure (usually), which makes him your friendly neighborhood psychopath. However, unlike most psychopaths depicted on television, some viewers are tempted to see him as working for the greater good.\nCriminal Minds If you want to play “spot the psychopath,” no better show allows you to do so than Criminal Minds. A crime drama that follows the FBI profilers of the Behavioral Analysis Unit, the show masterfully examines the personalities and motives of serial predators who commit horrific crimes. The skill set and empathy of FBI profilers like genius Spencer Reid and Special Agent Rossi contrasts the horrific cruelty of the violent criminals they hunt down, making for a riveting yet dark show.\nPretty Little Liars A fan favorite of millennials growing up, Pretty Little Liars is a teen mystery series that highlights the narcissistic and psychopathic traits and behaviors of its female characters specifically. Whether it’s “Queen Bee” Alison DiLaurentis who uses relational aggression to pit her friends against one another and maintain status, or the genius Mona who orchestrates the downfall of her friends through elaborate means – or the mysterious, murderous “A” character who always seems to be in the corner stalking their every move, Pretty Little Liars is filled with suspense and drama that will keep you on your toes.\nMad Men With the backdrop of 1960’s rampant misogyny and aggression toward women, Mad Men is filled with plenty of narcissistic people to choose from – just take your pick of cigar-smoking, wife-beating men. From the pathological liar and serial cheater Don Draper who uses his charming false mask and success as an advertising executive to escape accountability to the narcissistic rapist Greg Harris who forces himself on his girlfriend Joan, viewers will be sucked into a world where narcissists seem to reign in positions of power, and only face consequences at the very end.\nVeronica Mars Moonlighting as a private investigator under her detective father’s wing, Veronica Mars is a murder mystery series about a charismatic high school student in the fictional town of Neptune who, with the help of her friends Mac, Wallace, Logan and Weevil, solves numerous mysteries. Yet the largest two unsolved mysteries throughout the series remain who killed her best friend Lilly and who drug-raped her at a party. As Veronica enters a world of manipulators, criminals, and shady characters, viewers are captivated by the long-lasting “whodunnit” and the personal growth and relationships of the rambunctious P.I.",
