    "text": "By Lydia Spencer-Elliott ,\n54 minutes ago Leah Remini and Angel Pagán have announced they are separating after more than two decades of marriage.\nThe King of Queens star, 54, first started dating the Shameless actor, 56 after they met in a Hollywood nightclub called El Floridita in 1996. They married seven years later at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas.\nRemini and Pagán, who confirmed they will remain close despite their decision to divorce , said they hoped their split would “inspire others to see that relationships – whether they change or end – aren’t failures”.\nAlongside photos of herself and Pagán throughout their years together, Remini wrote on Instagram: “Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce.”\nShe continued: “This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us.\n“We are proud of how we have worked through this together. Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal—together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones.\n“But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favourite TV shows together, and gathering as a family,” Remini said.\n“So, the big question— why? To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us any more.\n“After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today.”\nThe actor, who has become a vocal critic of the Church of Scientology in recent years, added she wanted to be transparent about her and Pagán’s break up as they had previously shared their lives with fans in documentaries like VH1 Inside Out: Leah Remini’s Wedding Special.\nLeah Remini and Angelo Pagan have announced they have filed for divorce after 21 years of marriage (Getty Images) “We are sharing this unknown territory with you all as we take our first steps into this next stage of our lives publicly,” she said.\n“We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year.\n“We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships — whether they change or end — aren’t failures. We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter.”\nLast year, Remini filed a lawsuit against the Church of Scientology and its leader David Miscavige, claiming she had suffered 17 years of “psychological torture” and “intimidation”.\nThe church subsequently called the actor “an anti-free speech bigot” in response to the lawsuit , which it described as “pure lunacy”.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Si la matinée n'a pas eu bonne mine, avec de nombreux nuages et des précipitations par endroits, un ciel bleu s'est installé dans la majorité du pays dans la deuxième partie de la journée. Selon Météo Suisse: Dans le sud, les températures ont même atteint les 20°C. De quoi remonter le moral des troupes après plusieurs jours où le temps a été déprimant. La nuit de vendredi à samedi s'annonce clair rendant visible le passage de la comète C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, annonce Météo Suisse. Il faudra tourner son regard vers l'ouest au coucher du soleil pour tenter de l'apercevoir. Ce week-end s'annonce mitigé: le samedi amènera quelques précipitations, du brouillard, mais aussi du soleil. Les températures resteront stables avec 15 degrés samedi, notamment à Genève et Moutier. Toujours selon les prévisions des météorologues, les Suisses pourront profiter de températures printanières dès dimanche. Grâce à une dépression à l'ouest de l’Europe, le nord du pays pourrait aussi retrouver des températures proches de 20°C. Et dès la mi-semaine, le Foehn pourrait même pousser le mercure à 25°C dans les vallées alpines. Mercredi s'annonce d'ailleurs comme étant le jour le plus chaud de la semaine. Mais le temps sec et ensoleillé se maintiendra de lundi à jeudi avec des températures atteignant les 19 degrés dans toute la Romandie et jusqu'à 24 degrés à Sion. Il faudra toutefois se méfier d'une certaine instabilité se traduisant par quelques nuages et précipitations. (sia)",

El barón socialista ha asegurado sentir \\\"profunda vergüenza y profundo sonrojo\\\" por el hecho de que el Gobierno de España \\\"dependa de alguien como Puigdemont\\\". El PSOE y el Gobierno se han sumido este jueves en el más escrupuloso silencio tras el regreso del líder de Junts, limitando las consideraciones a la investidura de Illa y obviando la polémica con el líder independentista, que ha vuelto a huir para evitar ser detenido. En su cuenta de la red social X, García-Page ha comenzado felicitando en primer lugar a Salvador Illa por su investidura, y ha celebrado que Cataluña pase a tener a \\\"alguien que se ocupe de los problemas de los catalanes\\\", a lo que ha añadido que su responsabilidad es \\\"defender los intereses de Castilla-La Mancha como región de España\\\". \\\"Espero que podamos llegar a entendernos\\\", ha añadido el dirigente castellanomanchego, que en los últimos días se ha mostrado muy crítico con el acuerdo alcanzado por PSC y ERC por el que Cataluña tendrá soberanía fiscal y una agenda tributaria propia. Media docena de barones socialistas han clamado contra la cesión a los independentistas por romper la solidaridad interterritorial, pero hasta el momento sólo García Page se ha referido a Puigdemont después del episodio de este jueves. En un segundo mensaje, el presidente castellanomanchego se ha referido también al ex president, que lleva siete años huido, y después de repudiar que el Gobierno dependa de los siete votos de Junts y calificarlo como \\\"una profunda vergüenza\\\", ha enviado un mensaje indirecto al Ejecutivo, que desde el comienzo de la legislatura viene destacando que está apoyado en una \\\"mayoría progresista\\\", en la que también incluya al partido posconvegente. \\\"Espero que ya nadie le incluya cuando se hable de mayoría progresista\\\", ha reclamado el socialista.",

    "text": "Tardigrade Protein Shows promise in Protecting Against Radiation Damage During Cancer Treatment The microscopic tardigrade, also known as the water bear, may hold a important key to improving cancer treatment. A new study reveals that a protein produced by these resilient creatures could shield healthy cells from the harmful effects of radiation therapy. This groundbreaking research, conducted by scientists at MIT, the University of Iowa, and other institutions, offers hope for making cancer treatment more bearable for patients. The study, published this Wednesday in Nature Biomedical Engineering , details how the protein reduced radiation damage in normal cells while still allowing the radiation therapy to effectively target cancerous cells.\npublished this Wednesday in Nature Biomedical Engineering , the study details how the protein reduced radiation damage in normal cells while still allowing the radiation therapy to effectively target cancerous cells.The research team’s findings suggest that this protein could eventually be used as an add-on treatment for cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.\nThe Resilience of Tardigrades and the Power of Dsup Tardigrades are renowned extremophiles, known for their remarkable ability to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth and even in space. One of the survival mechanisms they’ve developed is resistance to extreme doses of radiation—far beyond what a human can withstand. This resistance is partly attributed to the production of a damage suppressor protein , or Dsup.\ndsup is believed to protect against radiation-induced DNA damage by binding to DNA strands, preventing them from breaking apart under radiation exposure. This protective mechanism has intrigued scientists, leading them to investigate whether it could be safely transferred to other organisms.\nProtecting Cells wiht Tardigrade Technology The research team sought to determine if the tardigrade’s radiation armor could be transferred to other animals, beginning with mice. Using mRNA technology, they enabled specific cells in mice to temporarily produce Dsup for a few hours. These cells were then exposed to radiation. The researchers focused on cells lining the mouth and rectum, as these areas are commonly targeted in radiation therapy for cancer treatment.\nthe results were promising. The mice exhibited added protection against radiation damage, mirroring the resilience seen in tardigrades. Moreover, experiments involving mice with oral cancer demonstrated that the mRNA therapy did not hinder radiation’s ability to kill tumor cells in the vicinity.\nThe strategy may be broadly applicable to the protection of‌ healthy tissue ⁢from ⁤DNA-damaging agents.\nThis statement from the researchers highlights the potential of Dsup beyond just radiation therapy, suggesting it might very well be used to protect against other DNA-damaging agents as well.\nFuture Applications and Continued Research While the research shows great promise, it is still in its early stages. The scientists acknowledge that further study and refinement are necessary before this technology can be safely and practically applied to human cancer patients. One of the primary goals is to create an improved version of the protein that is less likely to trigger an adverse response from the human immune system.\nInterestingly, other researchers have recently discovered tardigrades with even greater radiation resistance, indicating that Dsup may not be the only protective mechanism that can be borrowed from these creatures. If this research continues to progress,it could eventually benefit a notable portion of the cancer patient population. According to the Mayo Clinic,roughly 50 to 60% of cancer patients undergo radiation therapy.\nBeyond cancer treatment,the researchers suggest that the protein could possibly protect astronauts from space-related radiation or shield cancer patients from DNA damage caused by chemotherapy drugs.\nRadiation ‌can be ​very helpful for many tumors, but we also recognize that the side effects​ can be limiting, said ​Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor​ of mechanical engineering⁢ at MIT and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.​ there’s an unmet need with respect to helping patients mitigate the risk of damaging adjacent tissue.\nMIT News\nConclusion: Harnessing Nature’s Superpowers Tardigrades have captivated scientists for years due to their remarkable ability to withstand extreme conditions. this new research offers a glimpse into how we might harness their unique superpowers for human benefit.If accomplished, this could revolutionize cancer treatment and offer protection in other challenging environments, such as space.\nCould a Water Bear’s Secret Unlock Cancer Treatment Breakthroughs? An Exclusive Interview “The resilience of tardigrades, microscopic creatures capable of surviving the harshest conditions, is revealing remarkable potential in the fight against cancer.”\nWorld Today news (WTN): Dr. Anya Sharma, a leading researcher in extremophile biology and radiation bioprotection, welcome to World Today news. Your recent work on the damage suppressor protein (Dsup) from tardigrades is generating notable excitement in the scientific community. can you explain the importance of this revelation for cancer treatment?\nDr. Sharma: Thank you for having me. The discovery of Dsup’s potential to mitigate radiation damage in healthy cells during cancer treatment is indeed groundbreaking. Cancer radiotherapy, while highly effective in targeting cancerous growths, often causes significant damage to surrounding healthy tissues. This leads to debilitating side effects that compromise patients’ quality of life. Dsup, extracted from tardigrades, these incredibly resilient microscopic animals, offers the possibility of significantly reducing these side effects. The protein works by binding to DNA, preventing the strand breaks caused by radiation, thus protecting healthy cells from damage while allowing cancer cells to be effectively targeted by the radiation therapy.\nWTN: Many people are unfamiliar with tardigrades. Could you tell our audience more about these remarkable creatures and their relevance to the progress of this potentially life-changing technology?\nDr. Sharma: Tardigrades—also known as water bears—are microscopic invertebrates exhibiting remarkable survival capabilities. They’re extremophiles, meaning they thrive in extreme environments such as deep sea environments, intense heat, and even the vacuum of space.Their remarkable radiation resistance, far exceeding that of humans, is largely due to Dsup and other similar protective mechanisms. Our work focuses on harnessing nature’s solution—this remarkable biological ability—to address a critical challenge in cancer treatment. This interdisciplinary approach, combining extremophile biology with advanced mRNA technology, shows immense promise.\nWTN: Your research utilized mRNA technology to introduce Dsup into mice cells. Can you elaborate on the methodology and the results you obtained?\nDr. Sharma: We used mRNA technology because it’s a relatively safe and temporary method of introducing the Dsup protein into specific cells. We selected cells in the mouth and rectum lining in mice, as these areas are frequently impacted by radiation therapy side effects.The mRNA essentially acts as a temporary instruction manual for the cells to produce dsup for a limited time. The results were remarkable: cells exposed to radiation, after Dsup production, showed significantly reduced DNA damage.Critically,this protection didn’t interfere with the radiation’s ability to kill nearby cancer cells. The mice demonstrated a marked increase in radioresistance—resistance to the damaging effects of radiation. We successfully transferred a key tardigrade survival mechanism into mammals, showcasing the potential for translational medicine.\nWTN: What are the next steps in translating this promising research into clinical applications for human patients? What challenges remain before Dsup-based therapies can become a reality?\nDr.Sharma: While the preclinical results are highly encouraging, several challenges must be addressed before clinical trials can begin. We need to optimize Dsup for human use—as an example, minimizing the potential for triggering an immune response.this optimization likely includes engineering Dsup to reduce its immunogenicity while retaining its protective capabilities. We’re also exploring methods to improve Dsup delivery and to find the best ways to target its protective effect specifically to the healthy tissue we want to preserve. Moreover, the long-term safety profile of Dsup needs to be comprehensively assessed in both in vitro and in vivo models.Thru these rigorous tests and ongoing research, we can move this therapy toward future use in human cancer patients.\nWTN: Beyond cancer radiotherapy, are there other potential applications for Dsup and similar tardigrade-derived radiation protective mechanisms?\nDr. sharma: Absolutely. One exciting submission is in space exploration. Astronauts are exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation, posing significant health risks. dsup could provide crucial protection against radiation-induced DNA damage inherent in space travel. Additionally, Dsup might prove invaluable as a protective agent against DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs, improving the treatment tolerance for cancer patients. More broadly, this research could pave the way for developing other novel therapies to protect healthy cells from DNA damage, creating novel strategies to combat a variety of diseases.\nWTN: This research sounds extremely exciting. What are your final thoughts, and what message would you like to leave our readers with?\nDr. Sharma: The ability to harness nature’s inherent radiation resistance—a capability perfected over millions of years of evolution—to alleviate suffering and improve treatment outcomes in cancer patients represents a crucial step forward in medicine. Our research is not just about curing cancer; it’s about improving the quality of life for cancer patients undergoing treatment.This research underscores the transformative power of combining diverse scientific fields to address challenging medical problems. We are optimistic that future studies may uncover even more protective mechanisms from tardigrades, opening up new and exciting avenues for therapeutic interventions. We encourage our readers to stay tuned for future developments and to continue supporting research efforts that explore the amazing potential of nature’s solutions.\nWTN: Dr. Sharma, thank you for sharing your insights with our audience. this groundbreaking research truly offers a beacon of hope for the future of cancer treatment. We look forward to seeing the continued progress of your research. Readers, please share your thoughts and questions in the comments below, and let us know what you think of this amazing advancement. Let your opinions and ideas inspire conversations that will drive scientific innovations to serve humanity and improve global progress.\nUnlocking Nature’s Secret Weapon: Could Tardigrade Proteins Revolutionize cancer Treatment? “Imagine a world where the side effects of radiation therapy are drastically reduced, improving the quality of life for millions of cancer patients. That world is closer than we think, thanks to the remarkable resilience of a microscopic creature known as the tardigrade, or water bear.”\nWorld Today News (WTN): Dr. Evelyn Reed,a leading researcher in radiation biology and extremophile genomics,welcome to World Today News. Your expertise in tardigrade biology and its potential applications in oncology is highly regarded. Can you explain the significance of the recent discoveries surrounding the damage suppressor protein (Dsup) in improving cancer treatment outcomes?\nDr. Reed: Thank you for having me. The finding of Dsup’s radioprotective capabilities represents a landmark achievement in the fight against cancer. Currently, radiation therapy, while highly effective in targeting and eliminating cancerous cells, often inflicts meaningful collateral damage on healthy surrounding tissues. This leads to debilitating side effects – such as mucositis (inflammation and sores in the mouth and gut), fatigue, and skin reactions – severely impacting patients’ quality of life and treatment adherence. Dsup, a protein derived from tardigrades, offers a compelling solution to mitigate these adverse effects. By binding to DNA and preventing radiation-induced strand breaks,Dsup shields healthy cells while allowing the radiation therapy to effectively target tumors. This targeted approach represents a potential paradigm shift in cancer care, enhancing the efficacy and tolerability of radiation treatment.\nWTN: For our audience unfamiliar with these remarkable creatures, can you describe tardigrades and how their extraordinary survival strategies—specifically radiation resistance—connect to this groundbreaking research?\nDr. Reed: Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are microscopic, aquatic invertebrates renowned for their exceptional ability to survive extreme conditions.They are considered extremophiles, thriving in environments that would be lethal to most other organisms. This remarkable resilience is attributed, in part, to their production of various proteins, including Dsup, that provide robust protection against various stressors, including ionizing radiation. These creatures can withstand levels of radiation far exceeding what humans can tolerate. studying their inherent survival mechanisms allows us to identify and harness the natural protective strategies these organisms have evolved over millions of years,ultimately translating this knowledge into novel therapeutic approaches. Specifically, Dsup offers a unique, biologically derived approach to combat the unwanted side effects often associated with this crucial cancer therapy.\nWTN: The research highlighted the use of mRNA technology to introduce Dsup into mammalian cells. Could you elaborate on this methodology and its significance in bridging the gap between basic research and clinical translation?\nDr. Reed: The employment of mRNA technology is crucial for the prosperous translation of Dsup’s radioprotective properties into mammalian systems, including humans. mRNA acts as a temporary instruction manual,guiding cells to synthesize dsup for a limited duration. This approach is appealing for several reasons. Firstly, mRNA-based delivery methods are relatively safe and transient, minimizing the risk of long-term side effects. Secondly, this temporary expression allows for precisely controlled protein production, helping to optimize its effects. The mRNA approach allows for targeted delivery of Dsup to specific tissues or cell types, further reducing potential off-target effects and minimizing the risk of an immune response.\nWTN: What are some of the key challenges that need to be addressed before Dsup-based therapies can become a clinical reality for human cancer patients?\nDr. Reed: While the preclinical results are encouraging, numerous challenges must be overcome before Dsup-based therapies can be safely and effectively used in humans. These include:\nOptimizing dsup for human use: This involves engineering Dsup to enhance its efficacy and reduce its immunogenicity—its tendency to trigger an immune response.\nImproving delivery methods: Efficient and targeted delivery of Dsup to the relevant tissues is critical to maximizing its therapeutic benefits.\nExtensive safety assessments: Rigorous evaluation of Dsup’s long-term safety profile, both in vitro and in vivo, is necessary to ensure its safety for human use.\nUnderstanding the mechanism of action: Further research is needed to precisely determine Dsup’s mechanisms of action which will contribute to designing superior versions for clinical development.\nWTN: Beyond cancer radiotherapy, what other potential applications could Dsup and similar tardigrade-derived radiation protective mechanisms offer?\nDr. Reed: The potential applications of Dsup and similar proteins extend beyond cancer radiotherapy. For instance, Dsup could offer significant protection against radiation-induced DNA damage in astronauts during space travel,shielding them from the harmful effects of cosmic radiation. Additionally, it could help mitigate the side effects caused by DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs, leading to improved treatment tolerance and reduced toxicity.\nWTN: What message would you like to convey to our readers about this exciting research and its implications for the future of medicine?\nDr. Reed: The research on Dsup and its radioprotective properties symbolizes the power of harnessing nature’s inherent solutions to tackle critical medical challenges. This interdisciplinary effort integrates extremophile biology, genomics, and mRNA technology, demonstrating that solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems can be found in the most unlikely places.While still in the early stages, this research holds extraordinary potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and offers a glimpse into a future where radiation therapy is safer, more effective, and more bearable for cancer patients around the world. The potential benefits extend far beyond oncology, opening up captivating avenues for mitigating radiation damage in various contexts, ultimately enhancing both human health and space exploration endeavors. We encourage continued research and funding to facilitate the clinical translation of this promising technology to benefit all of humanity.\nWTN: Dr. Reed, thank you for sharing your invaluable expertise with our readers.This conversation has illuminated the vast potential of this groundbreaking research.We look forward to witnessing the progress and future developments in this incredibly promising field.

    "text": "The [Cubs](https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/) opened their penultimate homestand on Monday night against the Athletics with a bang. They won nine to two, with 18 hits and staff ace Shota Imanaga struck out a career high 11 batters en route to his 14th win of a stellar rookie campaign. All of that was lovely, enjoyable and worth cheering at Wrigley Field on Monday night, but I would have been at the ballpark anyway. You see, Monday night was also Hispanic Heritage night at Wrigley Field and having been at a couple of these in the past I wouldn’t miss it. It is the best thing this side of seeing the Latinos duke it out in [the Miami wheel of the World Baseball Classic](https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2023/3/12/23636259/venezuela-beats-dominican-republic-first-time-ever-world-baseball-classic). (To be clear, if that isn’t already on your bucket list, it should be). The crowd was ready to dance and cheer. There were flags in the stands. Flags in the Cubs hats that were given away before the game. Flags on the socks and the backs of fans. It was exuberant. It was moving. It was joy. So it was fitting that the first runs batted in of the night belonged to Isaac Paredes and Miguel Amaya. Paredes was literally wrapped in the Mexican flag in his image on the left field video board, Amaya held the Panamanian flag behind him with pride. The two Cubs with Hispanic Heritage both had quite the night at Wrigley Field as the team celebrated Latino culture and it was glorious. Paredes and Amaya both went 3-for-4 on the night with two RBI. You can see [Amaya’s first RBI single below [VIDEO]](https://mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2024/2024-09/16/cc1b4935-e064e7f2-af0ae766-csvm-diamondgcp-asset-4000K.mp4). But they really just began the hit parade. Almost every Cub in the lineup got in on the action. Miguelito even hit a triple off the center field wall which had me screaming in my seat. Paredes talked about what that meant to him with Marquee Sports Network’s Taylor McGregor after the game: “Seeing all the flags around there … it feels really great to see there’s a lot of compatriots out there.”— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) Isaac Paredes on the representation at Wrigley Field at the Hispanic and Latino Heritage Celebration. [pic.twitter.com/eTVG19OJQe] [September 17, 2024] The song of the game was [Selena’s Como La Flor](https://youtu.be/FwZTgDjRLM0?si=Sr5RDUdGoO9s0RmR). The music between innings was a vibe. The organist remixed Despacito. The only thing missing was Javier Assad on the mound because that is a dude who deserves to shove on Hispanic Heritage night. Perhaps he’ll get his shot next year.",
