    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nSolamente van a por su propio interés, descaradamente. TODO lo que dicen son excusas fabricadas para el caso concreto.\nTa están atacando otra vez a la independencia de los jueces estos rojos masones. Independencia para defender hoy una cosa y mañana la contraria según les convenga.\n[#5](c5#c-5) Eso es una burla a la democracia. Los órganos de gobierno del poder judicial deben representar, al igual que el parlamento, las proporciones ideológicas votadas por el pueblo de cuya soberanía emana el poder. Cada vez está más claro que el poder judicial en España es bastante poco democrático. Atado y bien atado.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Eso es una barbaridad. Es como si los políticos también decidieran elegirse entre ellos. Lo veríamos algo absolutamente intolerable, una propuesta golpista. El poder judicial no es un poder diferente ni del legislativo, ni del ejecutivo. En estos momentos, los jueces que dirigen los órganos del poder judicial son usurpadores y deberíamos tratarlos como a tales.\n[#22](c22#c-22) Es una idea que han propuesto algunos que no tiene ni pies ni cabeza.\nArtículo 1 de la Constitución Española:\n2. La soberanía nacional reside en el pueblo español, del que emanan los poderes del Estado.\nSi el poder judicial se eligiera a si mismo, dejaría de emanar del pueblo español y, por lo tanto, sería contrario a la Constitución.\n[#11](c11#c-11) El poder ejecutivo es elegido por el Parlamento, que a su vez es el poder legislativo. Es de pura lógica, por lo tanto, que la distribución del poder judicial sea acorde a esta. Y ya. Todas las demás propuestas que no tienen otro objetivo, más o menos declarado, que mantener un poder conservador en los órganos de poder judiciales independientemente de la voluntad popular son ajenas al espíritu de la Constitución que la derecha tantísimo dice amar y respetar.\nEn serio al PP le merece la pena quemar de esta manera a la judicatura para salvar el culo de sus corruptos, pero si ellos son ya el \"nuevo PP\" 100% corruption free.\nYa se desmarcaron de la chusma ladrona que trajo Aznar, que importa que los encierren, si ellos ya no tienen nada que ver\n[#7](c7#c-7) Si hubiese una judicatura digna, mañana mismo estaban encerrados todos los corruptos, hasta el ilocalizable M. Rajoy.\nYo, honestamente, no estoy de acuerdo en que los políticos sean los que elijan a los jueces porque cada legislatura sería un cachondeo poniendo jueces de tu cuerda. En ese sentido me gusta más el sistema de USA de que sea vitalicio porque dejarían de tener que preocuparse de las repercusiones de sus actos con respecto al que mande cada vez. Sería complicado cómo elegirles, eso sí.\nPor otro lado a ver si podéis responderme: ¿es cierto que si ahora mismo el PSOE quisiera podría iniciar la renovación proponiendo candidatos desde el Congreso y el Senado?. Porque en caso de que sea así lo que está claro es que no les interesa porque no saldría lo que ellos quisieran, y lo mismo ocurría en su momento con el PP y estarían diciendo lo mismo los del lado contrario.\n¿No se supone que desde la UE les han dicho que se pongan las pilas?. Mira que la política siempre me interesó lo justo pero entre unos y otros han conseguido que, a día de hoy, mi interés sea nulo.",

    "text": "The national capital experienced significant rainfall, leading to waterlogging and traffic jams in various areas. (Photo: India TV News) At least 10 flights that were to land at the Delhi airport were diverted on Wednesday evening due to heavy rains in the national capital. An official said that at least 10 flights were diverted at the airport after 1930 hours due to bad weather. Of these, eight were diverted to Jaipur and two flights to Lucknow. The national capital witnessed heavy rains that also caused waterlogging and traffic congestion in several areas. On social media platform X, airlines said that flights might get affected due to the bad weather. Vistara said flight UK998 from Pune to Delhi has been diverted to Lucknow due to bad weather at the Delhi airport. Flights to and from Delhi may get affected due to bad weather this evening. “Guests are advised to start early for the airport, as slow traffic and waterlogging may delay movement”, Air India said. SpiceJet said that due to “bad weather (heavy rain) in Delhi (DEL), all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights may get affected”. “We have a special announcement straight from the heavenly skies! The rain gods have decided to shower #Delhi with their blessings tonight. As a result, we’re expecting heavy rainfall throughout the night,” IndiGo said in a post on X and asked passengers to check the status of their flights.",

    "text": "Casi Las 5 En vivo\nUn tribunal de Moscú condenó este jueves a penas de entre cinco años y medio y siete de cárcel a dos poetas rusos que participaron en una lectura contra el conflicto de Ucrania, un ejemplo más de la represión presente en el país.\nMiles de rusos, opositores o simples ciudadanos, fueron condenados por tribunales por criticar la ofensiva en Ucrania, iniciada en febrero de 2022, a veces con penas especialmente severas.\nSegún comprobó un periodista de AFP presente en la audiencia, los simpatizantes de Artiom Kamardin, de 33 años, y de Yegor Shtovba, de 23, gritaron \"qué vergüenza\" al anunciarse la decisión.\n\"Es de una arbitrariedad absoluta\", exclamó el padre de Artiom Kamardin, Yuri. \"Todo el mundo es igual ante la ley, pero algunos son más iguales que otros\", ironizó su madre, Elena.\nAl menos diez personas fueron detenidas por la policía delante del tribunal tras el juicio.\nArtiom Kamardin y Yegor Shtovba fueron detenidos en septiembre de 2022 tras participar en una lectura pública en Moscú cerca del monumento al poeta Vladimir Maiakovski, punto de cita de disidentes desde la época soviética.\nEn esa lectura, Kamardin declamó un poema, \"Mátame, miliciano\", muy hostil a los separatistas prorrusos del este de Ucrania.\nAl día siguiente fue detenido durante un allanamiento en su domicilio, en el que afirma que fue golpeado y violado por los policías con un aparato de halterofilia.\nLos dos poetas fueron primero acusados de \"incitación al odio\", y luego inculpados también de \"llamado público a cometer actividades contra la seguridad del Estado\".\n\"No soy un héroe, y el ir a prisión por lo que pienso nunca formó parte de mis planes\", dijo Kamardin en su alegato final ante la corte, publicado en Telegram por sus simpatizantes.\nEl acusado pidió al juez que lo dejara \"regresar a casa\" y a cambio, prometió distanciarse de cualquier \"tema sensible\".\nSu esposa, Alexandra Popova, dijo a AFP estar indignada por la pena \"tan severa\" que se le impuso a su marido. \"Siete años por una poesía, un delito no violento...\", dijo.\n\"Si tuviéramos unos tribunales normales, esta situación no existiría\", añadió, antes de ser llevada por la policía, junto a un amigo del poeta y dos periodistas.\nTres personas, incluido un periodista, seguían detenidos el jueves por la noche antes de una vista judicial, acusados de participar en un mitin, según el medio de comunicación independiente Sota.\nLa abogada del periodista detenidos indicó unas horas antes que estaban acusados de \"alteración del orden público\" y se enfrentaban a 30 días de cárcel.\nShtovba, condenado a cinco años y medio, insistió durante el juicio en que no vulneró la ley.\nUn tercer poeta, Nikolai Daineko, detenido al mismo tiempo que los dos primeros, fue a su vez condenado a cuatro años de cárcel en mayo, según OVD-info.\nEl Ministerio alemán de Relaciones Exteriores condenó el veredicto y lamentó que la libertad de expresión esté \"sofocada\" en Rusia.\nEl poder ruso lleva años reprimiendo a las voces críticas, y la campaña se endureció desde el inicio de la ofensiva militar en Ucrania.\nSegún OVD-Info, cerca de 20.000 personas fueron detenidas en Rusia por su oposición al conflicto de Ucrania desde febrero de 2022.\nLa oenegé Memorial tiene contabilizados 633 prisioneros políticos entre rejas.",
