    "text": "THE easing of India’s rice export restrictions will benefit the Philippines, possibly allowing it to start cutting interest rates by October, according to financial services group Nomura.\nIn its report, Nomura said the Philippines, a major importer of rice, will be the “biggest winner in Asia” when India, the world’s top rice exporter, begins to ease its restrictions on rice exports.\n“Easing inflation would further support our view that [the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)] will start its easing cycle by October, although the risk of an earlier rate cut in August is rising, given recent comments by Governor Remolona that BSP does not have to wait for the Fed,” Nomura underscored.\nBSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. said the reduction in rice tariffs to 15 percent from 35 percent due to Executive Order (EO) No. 62 fuels the optimism of monetary officials for a possible rate cut as early as August.\nRemolona said the Monetary Board is now “less hawkish” or “more dovish” than before, as inflation is expected to slow to the midpoint of the 2 to 4 percent target range.\n“When the price of rice goes down, it can have a significant second-round effects, especially because the price of rice is a salient price—an important price in the formation of inflation expectations,” Remolona added.\nThe Monetary Board maintained the BSP’s Target Reverse Repurchase (RRP) rate at 6.5 percent while interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities will remain at 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively, during the last policy meeting on June 27.\nNomura said India’s easing on rice exports is likely to materialize as expectations of good harvest, ample rice buffer stocks and softening of rice price inflation is seen.\nThis would lower global rice prices as India accounts for the 35 percent of rice exported globally. Asia, where rice is a staple food, will also benefit from the fall in rice prices.\nThe outlook for Asia’s rice-producing countries Thailand and Vietnam is tempered due to dry weather conditions.\n“We expect the process of easing of India’s rice export restrictions to be gradual, with better crop prospects likely to cool local rice prices, in turn leading authorities to further ease restrictions, which should have favorable spillovers on global rice prices over time,” Nomura said.\nThe Indian government is looking into allowing white rice shipments with a fixed duty and may also remove the 20-percent tax on parboiled rice exports and impose a fixed levy instead, according to a Bloomberg story.",

    "title": "Jubilados: el Gobierno les pagará un bono de $55.000 en enero y febrero a quienes cobren la mínima",
    "text": "El Gobierno anunció hoy el pago de dos bonos, cada uno por un monto de $55.000 pesos, destinados exclusivamente a los jubilados que perciben el haber mínimo. Estos bonos habían sido anunciados inicialmente por el ex ministro de Economía, Sergio Massa, en octubre. Hasta la fecha, se abonó uno en noviembre bajo la administración de Massa, quedando la incertidumbre respecto a la decisión que tomaría el gobierno actual, encabezado por Javier Milei. En un acto formalizado el viernes mediante decreto, se autorizó el desembolso de los $55.000 correspondientes al mes de diciembre, y se dio a conocer que la Casa Rosada ha dispuesto también el pago de un tercer bono en enero. Esta noticia emerge en un contexto de incertidumbre sobre el futuro de las jubilaciones, ya que el Gobierno ha remitido al Congreso un proyecto de Ley que suspende la aplicación de la fórmula de ajuste de los haberes previsionales, pensiones y planes sociales. Hasta que la ley sea aprobada, de ser el caso, la fórmula actual seguirá en vigor. El último ajuste derivado de esta fórmula proporcionó un incremento del 20.87% desde diciembre, y el próximo ajuste se definirá en marzo, dependiendo de los acontecimientos en el Congreso con respecto a la ley ómnibus. El Ministerio de Economía está evaluando cuidadosamente esta opción, mientras se diseña y aprueba la nueva fórmula. La propuesta es mantener actualizadas las jubilaciones mínimas conforme a la tasa de inflación. En el equipo dirigido por el ministro Luis Caputo, aseguran que los aumentos discrecionales representan una solución más efectiva y beneficiosa para los receptores del haber mínimo en comparación con la aplicación continua de la fórmula actual. Dada la inflación ya manifestada en diciembre, que podría superar el 25%, y la que se espera en los próximos meses, la aplicación de la fórmula podría resultar más perjudicial que otorgar aumentos discrecionales. Persiste la incógnita sobre el destino de los haberes jubilatorios que superan el mínimo. No recibirán los bonos de $55,000 y no se contempla una compensación \"discrecional\", aunque no se descarta dicha posibilidad. Cuando Massa anunció los bonos complementarios para quienes perciben el haber mínimo, indicó que, de ser elegido presidente, el segundo bono correspondiente a enero ascendería a $65,000 y aumentaría a $70,000 en febrero. Por ahora, se confirma un pago de $55,000 en enero, pero aún no se ha determinado el monto del pago de febrero. El extenso proyecto de ley remitido por el Gobierno al Congreso suspende la movilidad previsional, facultando al Poder Ejecutivo para establecer una fórmula de ajuste de jubilaciones y pensiones, y otorgar \"aumentos periódicos discrecionales, priorizando a los beneficiarios de menores ingresos\". Esto se refleja en el proyecto de ley que declara la Emergencia Previsional, delegando facultades del Congreso al Ejecutivo en asuntos previsionales, entre otros temas. En el Decreto de Necesidad y Urgencia (DNU) 70/2023, ya se había declarado la Emergencia Previsional hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2025. El megaproyecto de ley establece que este plazo podría extenderse por 2 años adicionales mediante decisión del Poder Ejecutivo nacional. Además, deja abierta la posibilidad de que el Gobierno introduzca otros cambios o reformas más amplias, basándose en la delegación de facultades otorgada por el Congreso, y se aplicarán a todas las disposiciones subsiguientes que hagan referencia expresa a la emergencia pública declarada. Los jubilados y pensionados del sistema previsional nacional suman casi 6 millones. El 40% de los beneficiarios del Sistema Integrado Previsional Argentino (SIPA) tiene haberes iguales o inferiores al haber mínimo. Otro 23% percibe entre una y dos mínimas, mientras que el 37% restante concentra haberes iguales o superiores a dos haberes mínimos. El haber mínimo a diciembre es de $105,713 brutos (sin incluir bonos). La Pensión Universal para el Adulto Mayor (PUAM) es de $84,570, y el haber medio alcanza los $174,731.",

    "text": "近日，大宗市場風雲變幻，國際油價持續下跌，佈倫特原油主力期貨跌破70美元/桶的重要關口，且創下近三年新低，截至發稿，該品種收報69.8美元/桶。\n在A股市場，石油概念板塊亦表現疲軟，3月6日截至發稿，中曼石油（603619.SH）、貝肯能源（002828.SZ）、中海油服（601808.SH）、中國海油（600938.SH）均下挫。\n港股方面，中國海洋石油（00883.HK）、中國石油股份（00857.HK）、中海油田服務（02883.HK）亦集體走弱。\n分析人士認為，美國總統特朗普揮舞關稅的大棒，引發了一系列貿易爭端，國際局勢的變動有可能導致經濟低迷、減少全球能源需求，這是當前原油市場的憂慮所在。\n在原油供應方面，OPEC+國家將按計劃在4月提高石油產量。據悉，這也是OPEC+自2022年以來首次增產，背後原因或與特朗普的施壓有關。\n國泰君安期貨能化高級研究員認為，歐佩克+計劃4月開始增產，油價承壓持續下跌。美國關稅政策將拖累原油市場的需求。國際油價弱勢或未完全結束，趨勢仍偏弱。\n此外，美國國内庫存上周激增，美國能源信息署（EIA）數據顯示，上周美油庫存增加361.4萬桶，至4.338億桶，遠超分析師預期的34.1萬桶增幅。市場對供應過剩的擔憂進一步加深，油價短期恐難翻身。\n悲觀的情緒也導致投資者對油價重心預期進一步下移，不少公司下調了油價預測。CIBC Private Wealth Group高級能源交易員Rebecca Babin表示，市場正在對原油的下行風險重新定價，WTI的底部從65美元轉向接近 60美元。\n關於後市，國家發展改革委價格監測中心預計，國際貿易環境和地緣政治局勢均存在較大不確定性，將影響原油市場供需、擾亂市場預期，短期國際油價將呈弱勢震蕩走勢。\n財華網所刊載內容之知識產權為財華網及相關權利人專屬所有或持有。未經許可，禁止進行轉載、摘編、複製及建立鏡像等任何使用。\n如有意願轉載，請發郵件至content@finet.com.hk，獲得書面確認及授權後，方可轉載。\n更多精彩內容，請登陸\n財華香港網 (https://www.finet.hk/)\n財華智庫網(https://www.finet.com.cn)\n現代電視 (https://www.fintv.hk)",

    "title": "Elena Kagan Headed Off Disaster While Delivering a Victory for Civil Rights",
    "text": "Listen to Amicus:\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court handed down\nMuldrow v. St. Louis, an important civil rights victory for employees who face discriminatory job transfers. Mark Joseph Stern and Dahlia Lithwick discuss the case in Saturday’s Slate Plus episode of Amicus. Below is a preview of their conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity. To listen to the full episode on Saturday, join Slate Plus.\nDahlia Lithwick: We had some good news this week, a little bright moment in the form of a Title VII case that could have gone horrifically awry but didn’t. Mark, can you tell us about it?\nMark Joseph Stern: This case is about Jatonya Muldrow, who was a police officer in St. Louis. For years, she worked an exciting job investigating public corruption and human trafficking. She oversaw the gang unit and she worked with the FBI—it was a very active job. Then, suddenly, it all ended when a new commander came who didn’t think she could handle the “very dangerous” work of her post. So he transferred her to a job where she had the same pay and rank but mostly just supervised neighborhood patrol officers.\nMuldrow filed suit under Title VII, arguing she was discriminated against on the basis of sex. But she lost at the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which didn’t think the transfer was discriminatory. The court said a transfer doesn’t violate Title VII unless it imposes a “substantial harm” on the worker, and it didn’t see any such harm here. So, with the assistance of Brian Wolfman and students at the Georgetown Law Appellate Clinic, Muldrow took this case to the Supreme Court. She argued that employees should be able to raise a Title VII claim whenever they’re transferred because of a protected trait even if they can’t prove some kind of serious harm.\nAnd folks were very worried about that point, right? Because it seems as if transfers have certainly become a key way to screw over people without actually firing them. But this was a risky case to take to the Supreme Court as currently constituted.\nIt was risky in both directions. It’s risky because this is not a court that’s particularly favorable to civil rights claims, and because this\ncase might’ve given the conservative justices an opportunity to combat workplace diversity through Title VII.\nBut the risk paid off! The court unanimously sided with Muldrow, and Justice Elena Kagan wrote a really strong opinion for the court, saying: “Look, we all know transfers can be harmful without some showing of ‘substantial’ harm. A transfer might not include a pay cut, but it might slash someone’s duties, it might impair their career, it might impose a set of seemingly small irritations and roadblocks that all add up to something real.” And so Kagan wrote a somewhat narrow but still important decision saying that all a Title VII plaintiff has to show is some harm that’s above trivial. It doesn’t have to be substantial, major, burdensome, whatever. It just has to be harm, because that’s baked into the word discrimination. Kagan actually cited\nBostock v. Clayton County for that proposition, which I think is another smart move—she’s showing it’s still good precedent.\nBy maintaining the harm requirement, Kagan headed off the danger on the other side of this case: that the Supreme Court would weaponize it to attack diversity initiatives and DEI training. There was a real fear that the conservative justices would say that any different kind of treatment based on race or sex was unlawful, even if it’s positive. Think about a law firm that’s eager to promote more women, so it promotes a woman—does that mean she can sue because she has been “discriminated” against? The court didn’t go that far. And by keeping the decision narrow, it headed off this burgeoning effort among conservative lawyers and lower courts to repurpose Title VII as a weapon against “reverse discrimination,” to kill programs that make sure women and people of color can get a fair shake in the workplace.\nIt seemed as though the reason a lot of civil rights groups were terrified is because this case was a\ndouble-edged sword of either saying “No, transfers are totally benign” or “Yes, they’re discriminatory, and therefore all efforts at diversity are unlawful.” It comes out that neither of those things is true. It looks like DEI training lives to fight another day, and this is a narrow opinion with the right result. Kagan threaded the needle.\nRight. And that fear wasn’t hypothetical. There’s a case in the 10th Circuit where a correctional officer\nopposed DEI training on the grounds that it created a “hostile work environment” because it involved talk about race. There’s a case in the 8th Circuit where a father-son duo said DEI trainings violated their religious beliefs. There’s this theory developing that just to talk about race or sex—to say, for instance, “We’re working to create more pathways to promotion for people from underrepresented backgrounds”—is illegal. That it’s all a Title VII violation. And the court rejected that approach.\nOnly Justice Brett Kavanaugh tried to push the court to go all the way here. He wrote a separate opinion saying the court should have used this case to say any kind of different treatment is unlawful under Title VII. He sounded disappointed that the majority didn’t take the bait, but he was alone in that. And so I think this is just another example of Justice Kagan being a really smart strategic mind, using these narrow, carefully written opinions to head off ulterior motives on the right while securing a real and meaningful victory for the left.",

    "text": "Pro-Putin regional politician found dead outside his house\nBy Mariya Knight and David Shortell, CNN\n(CNN) — A politician from the party of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been found dead in a courtyard outside his home, local media reported Thursday, adding to the growing list of Russian elites who have died under unclear circumstances in recent months.\nVladimir Egorov, a Tobolsk City Duma Deputy from the ruling United Russia party, was reportedly 46 at the time of his death, which was reported by Russian newspaper Kommersant, citing the press service of the Investigative Committee for the Tyumen Region in Russia.\nThere were no “external signs of criminal death” on Egorov’s body, investigators told Kommersant. The committee “could not confirm the information about the circumstances of the deputy’s death” to Kommersant, it said, as they are “still conducting an autopsy.”\nRussian state media TASS meanwhile reported on Thursday that Egorov “was found dead in Tobolsk,” also citing the regional committee. And unofficial Telegram channel Baza – which has links to Russian security services – said Egorov’s body “was discovered in the courtyard of his house on Kedrovaya Street” on Wednesday.\nKommersant and TASS reported that investigators are still establishing the causes of Egorov’s death, while the Tobolsk City Duma published an obituary on its social media page Thursday saying that Egorov died “as a result of an accident.”\nThe Duma praised Egorov – its deputy chairman before his death – for providing “comprehensive support to the participants of the Special Military Operation and the families of military personnel” fighting in Ukraine and for taking “an active part in the social and political life of the city.”\nHe joins a list of prominent Russians who have died by suicide or in unexplained accidents in recent months and years, including several businessmen with ties to Russia’s two largest energy companies.\nAmong that group was Ravil Maganov, the chairman of Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil and gas company, which had previously taken the unusual public stance of speaking out against Russia’s war in Ukraine.\nMaganov died after falling out of the window of a hospital in Moscow, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\nRussian sausage magnate-turned-lawmaker\nPavel Antov, another member of the United Russia party who topped Forbes ranking of the 100 richest civil servants in Russia in 2018, died in India last December after falling from the third floor of his hotel, according to the Indian police.\nMonths before his death he had reaffirmed his support for Putin after denying he posted an anti-war message on WhatsApp, blaming an “unfortunate misunderstanding and a technical error.”\nIn May, Russian Deputy Minister of Science and Higher Education Pyotr Kucherenko died after\nfalling ill on a plane with a Russian delegation returning from a business trip to Cuba. A journalist who said he had spoken with Kucherenko in the months prior to his death said that Kucherenko had felt like a hostage of the Russian government and feared for his own safety.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Bringing Families Home Urban Hope, a Richmond non-profit provides affordable rentals to help families move out of poverty. TRANSCRIPT OF VIDEO TAMIKA DANIEL (COMMUNITY ORGANIZER, SCAN): Well, I thought I was going to be stuck in public housing for a very long time. Due to my credit, it was hard for me to find housing outside of public housing. All of the rent that I was seeing was 15 to 1,600 for decent three bedrooms. There was no way I could afford that comfortably on my own and still support me and four children. I was living in Fairfield Court housing projects. I was there for approximately six years. My rent was high for an unsafe environment. I didn't like to be outside. I didn't like my children to be outside. There was crime happening on a regular basis. I had my children early. I had my first son when I was 18 years old. I dropped out of high school 'cause I got pregnant at 17. I suffered through some domestic violence. That definitely took a hit to my self-esteem. And due to me not having a job and my credit being bad, the only thing I could afford at that time was public housing. So I filled out the application for Urban Hope, and I started going through the credit counseling and the financial advisory classes. LAWSON WIJESOORIYA (DIRECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT, URBAN HOPE): Urban Hope is a faith-based housing nonprofit in the East End of Richmond, and we have been on a mission to make a home a cornerstone of opportunity by keeping it affordable. Tamika came to us initially to seek rental housing. She was looking to leave the public housing community in which she was living. So she began renting with Urban Hope at an affordable rate. Less than 30% of her income is spent on her housing, and then she joined in our financial counseling program. So she meets with a caseworker and housing counselor. We really see our primary goal as partnering with families to move out of poverty. So we're coming up on Fairfield Court. And these were all placed in the East End, kind of cut off by some highway arteries. Fairfield Court, where Tamika used to live, is now only about two blocks from where she is now, but she feels a lot safer. TAMIKA DANIEL: Right before I moved in September, I received a letter from public housing saying that my rent was going up to $1,231, and when I got here, my rent was 750, and this is a new residence. This was new. It was never occupied before me and my children. So I'm extremely blessed. When I signed my lease on September 1st of 2021, it was one of the best feelings of my life, and I got my keys to this amazing house. This is my home, and I love it. It's peaceful. I always say if you can't find peace anywhere on Earth, it should be your home, and I'm thankful to finally be able to find peace when I walk through my doors. So being able to connect with an organization like Urban Hope, who not only focuses on the affordable housing, they help me come up with spending plans. They help me come up with debt resolution plans. It's like everything has gotten better, not just my housing with Urban Hope. It's been like a all-around effect on my mental health, my physical health, my spiritual health. Like, everything is better now. I obtained employment with a wonderful nonprofit that I'm still with to this day. LAWSON WIJESOORIYA: Tamika is an incredible Urban Hope tenant. She is a strong mom who has chosen a pathway to more thriving for her family, and I think she represents a lot of what it means to reinvest in the community in which you've come from. This is one of Urban Hope's newest construction projects. This was a renovation actually of a very dilapidated abandoned building that was pretty much falling down. Project:HOMES is developing the property. This project is still being constructed, and we believe that it will be finished and ready to be rented in about two months. Urban Hope owns 35 units of rental housing. LAWSON WIJESOORIYA: Our current average rent is, I believe, 785 depending on the family's income, the size of the unit. We have everything from single family units that are one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom, and four bedroom. Our primary model of how we are creating affordability is actually through a social impact lending model. Urban Hope is able to rent affordably because of ways that we acquire and develop the home more cheaply, both with philanthropy opportunities, as well as a lending model that reduces our financing cost. Urban Hope really seeks to be a part of the fabric of the East End community. When you drive around our neighborhood, you see tons of new construction, a lot of bakeries and restaurants, and some coworking spaces. What we talk about at Urban Hope is a racial equity lens. So we do believe that our work should be and is pointed towards a goal of creating more racial equity. The housing actual history of the United States is one of the most influential perpetrators of systemic racism. The greatest asset in the American economy for growing and transferring wealth is your home, and we have systematically created inequity based on race in the ability to gain wealth. So Urban Hope does see part of its work as repairing some of those injustices. TAMIKA DANIEL: The biggest thing for me was they helped me to understand and start the journey of my self-discovery, and what I wanted to do in life. Because it's easy to just give gift cards or food here and there, but they actually invested in me as a person, so that I could become self-sustainable, so now that I'm in a place where I can actually provide for me and my children. When I'm walking around here, it's still surreal sometimes. There have been plenty of times where me and my children, when we're walking into the house, we may stop right before we walk down the path and just look at each other and be like, \"Can you believe we live here?\" So that still happens to us a lot. And because of the space that I'm in now, this will be my third year hosting Christmas dinner at my house 'cause my family loves my space now. So it's amazing like looking from the outside. It's a great feeling. It's a great feeling, especially coming from public housing to something like this.",
