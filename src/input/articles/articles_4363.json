    "title": "Yes, Biden Has Declared War On Faithful Christians",
    "text": "President Joe Biden and his regime apparatchiks are hellbent on persecuting conservative Christians who defy their extremist agenda. Weaponization of Government Despite casting himself as a devoted Catholic, Biden has presided over what has arguably been the most antagonistic administration toward faithful Christians in the modern era. In January 2023, for example, the FBI issued a memo revealing that the agency’s field office in Richmond, Virginia, was tasked with investigating the alleged threat of “white supremacy” among Catholics who attend Latin Mass. As Evita Duffy-Alfonso previously wrote in these pages, the memo said the FBI “may potentially mitigate” the supposed “threat” of “Radical-Traditionalist Catholics” with “’tripwire and source development,’ which means further infiltration into Catholic communities using various kinds of informants.” While FBI Director Christopher Wray claimed during congressional testimony that the memo was “a single product by a single field office,” House Republicans later uncovered that multiple FBI field offices were involved in the document’s creation, including those in Los Angeles and Portland. But the Biden administration’s weaponization of government agencies against Christians doesn’t stop there. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has egregiously attempted to imprison Christians for publicly expressing their faith. In October 2022, the agency charged six pro-lifers under the unconstitutional Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act . Their crime? Peacefully praying, reading the Bible, and singing hymns in the hallway of an abortion facility in Nashville, Tennessee. A federal jury convicted these individuals last month. Participants such as Paul Vaughn could face up to 11 years in prison and $260,000 in fines should his likely decision to appeal the charges fail. Meanwhile, Biden’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other agencies have been busy harassing the largest Christian college in America. In December, the FTC filed a lawsuit against Grand Canyon University, alleging the school, “its marketer Grand Canyon Education, Inc. and its president and CEO Brian Mueller … used deceptive advertising and engaged in illegal telemarketing,” according to Fox Business . The lawsuit came several weeks after the Biden Department of Education fined GCU $37.7 million for allegedly lying to “over 7,500 former and current students about the cost of its doctoral programs over several years.” Mueller previously told The Federalist he believes the administration’s targeting of GCU is “obviously political” and an act of retaliation for the university suing the Education Department over its nonprofit status. Biden’s Foul Mouth In addition to signing legislation that assists leftist lawfare against Christians and religious organizations that uphold the true meaning of marriage, Biden has also used his presidency as a bully pulpit to condemn court decisions defending religious freedom. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that the government cannot force Americans and private businesses to provide services (i.e. personal expression) that violate their religious beliefs, such as the traditional view that marriage is between one man and one woman. In an attempt to undermine, Biden issued a statement attacking the court and affirming his belief that the state should be able to force religious worshippers to violate their sincerely held beliefs to cater to radical LGBT activists. Funny how Biden wasn’t as interested in using his platform to draw attention to the horrific shooting at a Christian school in Nashville last year, in which a woman pretending to be a man killed three children and three adults. Biden not only declined to visit the families of the victims, but it’s also unclear if the president even bothered to call these families to offer his condolences. Worse, in the aftermath of the shooting, the White House attempted to victimize the shooter by claiming the so-called “trans community” was “under attack.” While the FBI and local law enforcement have kept the shooter’s manifesto hidden from the public, alleged pages from the document released in November indicate the trans-identifying shooter targeted the Christian Covenant School children because they are white. History Repeats Itself Biden’s actions are egregious but not surprising. Throughout Scripture, Jesus makes clear that Christians will be persecuted for following him, for the world “hated [him] before it hated [us]” and we “are not of the world” (John 15:18-19). Christians are guaranteed suffering, whether in our private lives or from an authoritarian government attempting to squash Americans’ religious freedoms. RELATED: [Don’t Let The ‘Christian Nationalist’ Slur Shame You Into Hiding Your Faith ] Biden and his regime’s ongoing war against Christians is just history repeating itself. Those who follow God and His Word will be targeted, harassed, attacked, and worse. Whatever barbaric actions the administration may take next, it is incumbent upon all Christians to pick up their crosses and follow Christ, for his graciousness is greater than the suffering endured in this world.",

    "text": "A test that uses a simple cotton-bud cheek swab has been developed to monitor children with a potentially deadly heart condition.Medics said the test would allow clinicians to pick up small changes in the heart of patients without the need to take blood.\nThe swab has been designed for patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), a rare genetic condition where the heart's structure can become weak due to cells of the muscle tissue not developing as they should.\nOur test is providing a much-needed window into the minute changes happening in the hearts of ACM patients, in a totally risk-free, non-invasive way\nDr Angeliki Asimaki\nIt works by detecting the location of certain proteins in the cells of the cheek, which can predict periods of disease activity.\nChanges in the location of these proteins - known as a \"hot phase\" - can spark inflammation in the heart which can put patients at risk of dangerous heart rhythms.\nIf a change is picked up in the results - which take 48 hours to come back - the patient will undergo heart checks in hospital and be treated based on the results.\nAlmost 100 children are enrolled on a trial using the swab at Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh).\nAt the moment the test is being carried out during routine hospital check-ups.\nHowever, Dr Angeliki Asimaki, a senior lecturer at St George's, University of London, who is leading the research, is working on a home testing kit.\nShe said: \"Our test is providing a much-needed window into the minute changes happening in the hearts of ACM patients, in a totally risk-free, non-invasive way.\nPeople with ACM often live with day-to-day worries because of the unpredictable nature of their condition, in which dangerous symptoms can start with little to no warning\nProfessor Bryan Williams\n\"Doctors can be warned about which of their patients are most at risk of dangerous heart rhythms and other symptoms, allowing them to tailor treatment to ensure that each patient receives the best care for them.\n\"Patients, particularly children, have told us they hugely prefer the speed and ease of the cotton bud cheek swab compared to alternatives like blood tests.\"\nThe swab is also being trialled on 18 adults with ACM at St George's Hospital in London.\nBea Rasdall, 10, is one of the ACM patients taking part in the study at Gosh and has been swabbed four times by the research team.\nShe was diagnosed with ACM after experiencing symptoms of an unusually fast heart rhythm, including shortness of breath and dizziness.\nHer younger brother has also joined the study.\nBea's mother Liz Rasdall said: \"The test is adding another layer of reassurance to the family that the condition is being monitored.\n\"We think it's so important to take part in this research to improve how ACM is monitored and managed for children in the future.\"\nThe test is being developed with funding from the British Heart Foundation (BHF).\nProfessor Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the cardiovascular research charity, said: \"People with ACM often live with day-to-day worries because of the unpredictable nature of their condition, in which dangerous symptoms can start with little to no warning.\n\"The simple monitoring test being developed by Dr Asimaki and her team has the potential to provide reassurance to patients and their families that their condition is being kept under a watchful eye by medical professionals.\"\nAs well as monitoring patients, researchers are also working on a cheek swab to diagnose ACM.\nThe team will also carry out a study using the test to monitor women with the condition throughout their pregnancies in several London hospitals.\nTwo former Royal Navy minehunters handed over to Ukraine arrive in port",

    "text": "De cara al inicio del 2024, la astrología espera darle la bienvenida al Año Nuevo chino, el cual comenzará el próximo 10 de febrero. En esta línea, se sugiere hacer distintos rituales para recibir al Dragón, una criatura mítica que evoca nobleza, honor, poder, suerte y éxito.\nSegún indica el zodiaco chino diciembre y enero son los mejores meses para hacer ritos, con la esperanza de atraer prosperidad y energía positiva a sus hogares. Uno de estos rituales emblemáticos es el ceremonial del arroz.\nLos expertos en gastronomía oriental aseguran que este es mucho más que un alimento básico en la dieta asiática. Dicho grano simboliza valores profundos como la abundancia, la inmortalidad y la riqueza.\nAdemás, se le atribuyen propiedades protectoras y se cree que tiene el poder de atraer buena fortuna y fertilidad, haciendo de su uso una tradición indispensable en estos momentos previos al Año del Dragón.\n¿Cuáles son los mejores rituales para hacer con arroz? A continuación, uno por uno los ritos que se recomiendan hacer ante el inicio de un nuevo período.\nAgua de arroz Se debe utilizar el agua de arroz para lavar los pisos del hogar.\nDe acuerdo con algunas creencias, este ritual atraerá el dinero y la prosperidad. En tanto, es importante que al momento de hacer este ritual se limpie el piso de adentro hacia afuera, ya que esto simboliza que está retirando todo aquello que es negativo.\nTaza con arroz A lo largo de diez días debe colocar una cucharada diaria de arroz crudo en una taza. Al llegar el décimo día, se debe encender una vela blanca al lado del pocillo. Finalmente, ese arroz se lo debe utilizar para la preparación de una comida.\nCabe mencionar que algunas personas utilizan arroz glutinoso, el cual es conocido por su textura pegajosa, pues simboliza la unión y la cohesión familiar.\nArroz y monedas Coloca un poco de arroz seco en un frasco de vidrio junto con siete monedas, sin importar el valor económico.

    "text": "Alongside outdoor banners proclaiming service times and greetings to everyone, the home of Episcopalians in Manitou Springs for the past 120 years wears a cloak of sadness.\nSt. Andrews Episcopal Church, known as a stalwart source of spiritual sustenance and a model of Christian charity since its cornerstone was laid in 1905, is closing its Gothic Revival-style doors after a final deconsecration service at 5 p.m. on Thursday, March 6, with the Rt. Rev. Kym Lukas, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Colorado, presiding.\nRemaining Sunday services will be held at 10 a.m. on Feb. 23 and March 2, with the Rev. Kathy Macek presiding.\n“For over a century, this sacred space has been a beacon of faith, hope and service — offering worship, fellowship and unwavering support to the Manitou Springs community,” said Canon Mike Orr, spokesman for the Episcopal Church in Colorado, which is headquartered in Denver. “From the warmth of Sunday services to the generosity of the food pantry and the embrace of our outreach programs, St. Andrews has stood as a pillar of love and care.”\nAs the building is shuttered and either goes on the market for sale or is repurposed for another ministry or use in line with the denomination’s mission, that spirit will live on, Orr said.\n“We give thanks for all who have been part of this journey, trusting that God’s work will continue in new and meaningful ways,” he said.\nSt. Andrews' main outreach ministries — the Manitou Springs Community Food Pantry and Silver Key Senior Services' hot meal program — will continue at different locations.\nSilver Key will move its Monday through Friday lunch for seniors ages 60 and older to Community Congregational Church of Manitou Springs at 103 Pawnee Ave., likely beginning March 3, said Laurie Wood, the organization’s chief grants and compliance officer.\n“It’s not just a hot meal, it’s also a way to get out of the house, see other people, build community and find out about Silver Key’s other services for seniors,” she said.\nThe new site has free parking and space to expand, she said. Between 10 and 20 people now attend regularly.\nAnd the Community Pantry of Manitou Springs said on Facebook it is searching for a new location to host its weekly food distribution. “(St. Andrews) has graciously hosted the Manitou Springs Community Pantry since its inception, and our hearts go out to the entire congregation during this difficult time,” organizers posted.\nCommunity Congregational Church, a United Church of Christ affiliate, stands in solidarity with St. Andrews, said the Rev. Heather McDuffee, pastor.\n“Our church feels a real camaraderie with St. Andrews — we’ve done ecumenical services with them, and we want to be there for them,” she said. “Churches are closing all over; it’s a direct response to a post-COVID world, with volunteerism and nonprofit giving going down, and it’s important we care for those who quite literally live next door.”\nLeaders of Colorado’s Episcopal Diocese have grappled with whether to close St. Andrews for more than a decade, as attendance has averaged 31 people per service and dropped to less than 20 during the pandemic, Orr said. Attendance last year averaged 12 congregants each service.\nDonations also have decreased to the point of not being plentiful enough to maintain and sustain a viable congregation, he said. Collection plate contributions and pledges totaled $44,513 in 2023, records show. On top of that, the church has been led by “short-term supply clergy” for the past two years.\n“Closing a church is never a failure; it is a recognition that the church’s mission continues in new and evolving ways,” Orr said. “Sometimes, closing doors allows space for new ministries to be planted and fresh opportunities to emerge.”\nSt. Andrews’ departure joins a handful of Episcopalian churches to shut down over the past decade, Orr said, but statewide the diocese is growing. Colorado’s 95 Episcopal churches collectively saw average attendance of nearly 6,800 per Sunday in 2023, he said, which reflected a 10.4% increase over 2022.\nAnd, “Several new Episcopal worshipping communities have taken root across Colorado, reflecting the ongoing movement of the Holy Spirit,” Orr said. “We are excited for the possibilities ahead and the ways God will continue to work to bring hope, healing and renewal.”\nUpon St. Andrews’ closure, the diocese will assume control over remaining assets and determine the “appropriate disposition of the property,” he said. The 1905 Kimball pipe organ remains inside the church.",
