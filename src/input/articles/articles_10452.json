    "text": "Medical, humanitarian, and advocacy organizations call for a Day of Mourning for the Palestinian victims of Israeli war crimes killed on September 27, 2008 followed by repeated massacres culminating in the year of genocide. The full and open letter including signatories is below. A joint press conference will be held on Friday, September 27, 2024 on Parliament Hill.\nOTTAWA, ON , Sept. 26, 2024 /CNW/ - Community advocates are approaching Hon. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from the perspective of interfaith solidarity, driven by a shared commitment to peace, justice, and the sanctity of human life. Since the Nakba, Israel has conducted repeated massacres of Palestinian civilians. For example:\nSeptember 27th, 2008 : Israeli Operation \"Caste Lead\" kills 1400 Palestinians, 320 of whom were children, in 23 days of devastating air and ground attacks. November 14th, 2012 : Israeli Operation \"Pillar of Defense\" kills more than 80 people, mostly women and children, in an 8-day assault. July 8th, 2014 : Israeli Operation \"Protective Edge\" kills 2,310 Palestinians, 551 of whom were children, in a 50-day onslaught. Approximately 11,000 Palestinians were wounded, 20,000 homes were destroyed and 500,000 people were displaced. July 21st, 2014 : Israeli aerial and ground forces use white phosphorus bombs to pound several residential areas across Gaza . White phosphorus burns flesh down to the bone, and toxic phosphoric acid can also be released into wounds with phosphorus poisoning. The use of white phosphorus in Gaza , which is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, violates the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions. This is done to prevent harm to civilians and civilian property. May 2021 : Israeli 11-day assault kills 260 Palestinians, 67 of whom were children. Between 2008 to 2022, Israeli attacks in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank killed over 6,180 Palestinian civilians. Over the past nearly 1 year, there has been relentless carpet bombing of Gaza , killing more than 41,000 Palestinians, over 2/3 of whom are women and children. It is estimated more than 186,000 deaths are attributable to this current war on Gaza (1). Illegal white phosphorus was used again to bomb the Children's Hospital in Gaza . Israeli forces target Palestinian children and women with sniper attacks at close range to children's heads and chests, and bulldoze pregnant women to death. At least 3,000 children have had at least 1 limb amputated with no anaesthetic. More than 17,000 Palestinian children have been killed.(2) In addition, Save the Children estimates that 21,000 Palestinian children are missing, including more than an estimated 4,000 buried under rubble or in mass graves, burned alive, or kidnapped.(3) Outbreaks of polio and hepatitis as well as other diseases are now widespread. According to the UN, more children have been killed in the past several months in Gaza than in all global conflicts over the past 4 years (4). More than 1.8 million people are now being starved to death in Gaza with the illegal and immoral blockade on food, water and medical care. The healthcare system in Gaza has been completely destroyed, and international charitable organizations are unable to deliver medical relief. Critical medical supplies, including medications and equipment, are not allowed to enter Gaza . A total of 986 healthcare workers have been killed in Gaza since Oct 2023 by Israeli forces (5)\nIsrael has now extended these war crimes into the illegally occupied West Bank , where more than 650 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023 . Thousands of Palestinian children are held in Israeli jails under arbitrary detention with no charges, where they are abused, as reported by Save the Children. (3)\nAll 30 wells in Gaza have been bombed by the Israeli forces and Gaza is now uninhabitable (6). All hospitals, schools, universities, and even refugee camps have been bombed.\nThe ICJ has confirmed that Israel's prolonged occupation of Palestinian territories (including Gaza , the West Bank , and East Jerusalem ) is illegal. Israel , as an occupying force, is obligated to protect the people and the territory it is occupying. Instead, it has violated all principles of International Humanitarian law killing, burning, dismembering children and civilians, shutting down the press, killing journalists in record numbers and banning foreign reporters preventing documentation of the war crimes and atrocities occurring daily.\nCanada must respect and uphold the rulings of the International Court of Justice (and the International Criminal Court if arrest warrants are issued) and align our policy at the UN with International Law. We urgently call for serious diplomatic pressure to end the inhumane bombing and provision of humanitarian aid, the evacuation of wounded children and family members out of Gaza , and end Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian Territories. We call for an official day of mourning on Sept 27 and global action to stop the ongoing massacres of the Palestinian people.\nThank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We trust that you will act with compassion and urgency to help bring an end to this devastating war on children.\nSincerely,\nJustice For All Canada – Taha Ghuyar Canadians in Support of Refugees in Dire Need (CSRDN) - Dr. Aliya Khan Canadians for Palestine –Dr. Azzam United for Peace-Canadian Interfaith Coalition – Hugh Doherty Muslim Advisory Council of Canada Canadian Muslim Healthcare Network - Dr H.

What colors inspire trust? What do symbols mean in different cultures? What art styles suit different types of products and services? Those are all questions a good graphic designer can answer. To succeed in this area, a designer needs to be skilled in using certain software. Photoshop, InDesign, and Canva are three popular options. Social media influencer Social media influencing as a remote job revolves around individuals leveraging their online presence to create and share content, typically across platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter. Influencers often specialize in niches such as fashion, travel, food, or lifestyle, engaging their audience through regular posts, stories, videos, and interactive sessions. The remote nature of this job allows influencers to work from anywhere, giving them the flexibility to create content that resonates with their followers while collaborating with brands for sponsored posts, advertisements, and partnerships. Their income can vary widely, depending on their reach, engagement rates, and the types of collaborations they secure. The average salary goes [around 67K a year according to payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Influencer_Marketing/Salary). Role requires a blend of creativity, marketing skills, and an understanding of social media algorithms to effectively grow and maintain an audience. Travel Agent [Remote travel agents](https://www.indeed.com/q-Travel-Agent-Remote-jobs.html) work from anywhere in the world assisting customers in booking a variety of aspects of their leisure or business travel including hotel reservations, flights, cruises, tourist packages, car rental services and more. By understanding their preferences and budgets, travel agents can help their customers anticipate their own travel needs and possibilities. To do so, these professionals should have the necessary skills to collect payments, determine the most suitable travel insurance, coordinate transportation, handle travel inconveniences such as cancellations and refunds as well as advise clients regarding destinations, cultures, customs, weather and local activities. Given the huge amount of travel-related content available online, a knowledgeable travel agent stays current on travel trends, activities, and top destination bargains in order to provide added value to their clients. A degree is not essential, but the ability to keep accurate records of bookings, payments, transactions, phone calls, and meetings is required.

    "title": "ÚLTIMA HORA GUERRA RUSIA UCRANIA | Directo y última de la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania: Zelenski, Trump, Putin...",
    "text": "El presidente ruso Vladímir Putin ordenó a sus tropas invadir la vecina Ucrania el 24 de febrero de 2022. Desde entonces, la guerra sigue anclada en el este de Europa. Sigue al minuto las últimas noticias del avance militar de Rusia y de la respuesta de Kiev. Estados Unidos impulsa vías para alcanzar el fin de la guerra. La tregua está más cerca.\nActualizar 12 JUN 2025 - 9:00\nUcrania dice que bajas rusas, entre muertos y heridos, han superado el millón desde 2022 El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores ucraniano, Andrí Sibiga, afirmó este jueves que el número de bajas rusas ha superado el millón, entre muertos y heridos, en los casi tres años y medio desde que empezó la guerra en febrero de 2022. \"Un millón perdido para nada: Rusia no ha alcanzado ni uno solo de los objetivos estratégicos de sus objetivos a gran escala. Y no lo hará\", aseguró Sibiga en la red social X. El ministro subrayó que Ucrania no comenzó la guerra y quiere \"más que nadie\" que termine, pero que Rusia está obstaculizando todos los intentos para llegar a una solución negociada del conflicto, rechazando la propuesta de Kiev de un alto el fuego y de una reunión a nivel de presidentes. \"Hay que incrementar la presión sobre el agresor\", reclamó.\n12 JUN 2025 - 8:30\nAl menos 14 heridos en un nuevo ataque nocturno ruso contra Járkov Al menos 14 civiles resultaron heridos este jueves en un ataque nocturno con drones rusos contra la ciudad de Járkov, en el noreste de Ucrania, y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, un día después de que murieran tres personas y otras 60 fueran heridas en circunstancias similares. \"Por la noche, el enemigo atacó Járkov con drones. Se produjeron incendios en los distritos de Saltivski, Slobodski y Shevchenkivski de la ciudad; ardieron viviendas, locales comerciales y coches. 14 personas fueron heridas, incluidos cuatro niños\", informaron los servicios de emergencia del Estado en Telegram. Las labores de rescate y de apagado de incendios todavía continúan.\n11 JUN 2025 - 15:59\nSistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot Rusia afirmó este miércoles haber recibido aclaraciones de lsrael acerca del supuesto envío de un sistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot a Ucrania, que le permiten desmentir esta información. \"Hemos recibido aclaraciones del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Israel que indican que estas declaraciones no se corresponden con la realidad\", señaló en rueda de prensa la portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores de Rusia, María Zajárova.\n11 JUN 2025 - 13:26\nRusia dice que sus tropas avanzan en la región ucraniana de Dnipropetrovsk Unidades de dos agrupaciones militares del Ejército ruso avanzan en la región ucraniana de Dnipropetrovsk tras cruzar la frontera de la región de Donetsk , según informó este miércoles el Ministerio de Defensa de este país. \"Unidades de la agrupación militar Este salieron a la frontera occidental de la República Popular de Donetsk y están llevando a cabo una ofensiva en el territorio de la región de Dnipropetrovsk\", señala la nota castrense. Según el parte militar, en esta dirección los ucranianos contaron con 225 bajas desde el último comunicado durante combates en las localidades de Shevchenko, en la región ucraniana de Donetsk, Guliáipole y Malínovka, en la región de Zaporiyia, a unos 100 kilómetros entre las capitales de ambas regiones.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:55\nEl presidente de Serbia viaja a Ucrania por primera vez desde el inicio de la invasión rusa El presidente de Serbia , Aleksandar Vucic , aterrizará este miércoles en Ucrania en la que es su primera visita al país desde que comenzó la invasión rusa del territorio, un viaje que se enmarca en la cumbre que tendrá lugar en la ciudad de Odesa y en la que participarán más de una decena de líderes del sureste de Europa. Así lo ha confirmado la Presidencia serbia en un comunicado, en el que ha matizado que la visita de Vucic, que mantiene buenas relaciones y lazos históricos con Rusia, durará únicamente un día.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:11\nRepatrian a Ucrania los restos mortales de más de 1.200 soldados caídos Los restos mortales de un total de 1 .212 soldados ucranianos caídos cuyos cadáveres estaban en manos de las autoridades rusas han sido retornados a Ucrania , según anunció este miércoles en un comunicado el órgano del Estado ucraniano que se ocupa de los prisioneros de guerra. Se trata del primer retorno de cadáveres que se anuncia desde que ucranianos y rusos acordaran el 2 de junio en Estambul canjear los restos mortales de 6.000 soldados de cada bando que están en posesión del enemigo.\n11 JUN 2025 - 8:33\nAl menos dos muertos y 60 heridos en un nuevo ataque ruso contra Járkov Al menos dos personas murieron y otras 60 resultaron heridas en un nuevo ataque con drones lanzado anoche por las fuerzas rusas contra la ciudad de Járkov , en el noreste de Ucrania y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, según ha informado la Policía ucraniana en un comunicado. Entre los heridos hay, según la fuente, cinco niños, de los que tres han tenido que ser trasladados a un centro médico. Los dos muertos son una mujer de 47 años y un hombre de 65.\n10 JUN 2025 - 22:53\nFelipe VI llega a Eslovaquia para visitar a las tropas españolas del despliegue de la OTAN ante Rusia El rey Felipe VI llegó hoy a Eslovaquia para visitar este miércoles a las tropas españolas que lideran la brigada multinacional que la OTAN tiene desplegada en este país como parte de las medidas disuasorias ante Rusia en Europa del Este.\nEn rey, que llegó a Bratislava acompañado por la ministra de Defensa, Margarita Robles , fue recibido por el presidente eslovaco, Peter Pellegrini, en su residencia oficial en la capital, el Palacio Grassalkovich.\nEslovaquia es miembro de la Alianza desde 2004 y de la Unión Europea (UE) desde 2007.\n10 JUN 2025 - 21:40\nEl ataque ruso contra Kiev provoca daños en una cornisa de la catedral de Santa Sofía El ataque ruso de anoche contra la capital ucraniana dañó una cornisa de la catedral de Santa Sofía , un monumento histórico protegido por la UNESCO cuyos orígenes se remontan al siglo XI.\nSegún explicó la directora del complejo que alberga la catedral, el daño sufrido por la cornisa, que fue construida en el siglo XVII, tardará en ser reparado alrededor de un mes y medio.\nEl daño en el edificio fue causado por la onda expansiva de una de las múltiples explosiones que sacudieron la pasada madrugada el centro y otras zonas de Kiev, debidas a la caída o las interceptaciones de los drones y misiles lanzados por Rusia.\n10 JUN 2025 - 20:19\nUcrania evalúa limitar la red móvil para contrarrestar la amenaza de drones rusos Ucrania estudia introducir restricciones temporales en los servicios de telefonía móvil para perturbar el uso que Rusia hace de las redes móviles ucranianas para recabar información durante los ataques cada vez más masivos con drones, según deliberaciones en el seno de la comisión de Defensa del Parlamento ucraniano.\nLos drones rusos de largo alcance, incluidos los Shahed de fabricación iraní, están cada vez más equipados con tarjetas SIM ucranianas de prepago para recoger y transmitir datos críticos durante los vuelos, según informan los expertos que analizan los restos de drones.\nEsta inteligencia ayuda a Rusia a perfeccionar sus operaciones con drones y amenaza con hacer sus ataques cada vez más eficaces.",
