Sport 1 week ago Nandre Burger returned to pick up two wickets off consecutive deliveries, and from 52/2 in the 19th over, India were shot out for 131 in the 35th, a collapse of 79/8 in 16 overs.\nOnly Kohli showed the necessary skill to get on top of the SA bowlers, making 76 off 82 balls, but his composure was also absent at times, as shown in his role in the crazy run out of Jasprit Bumrah.\nThere will be plenty of questions for the Indians to answer.\nThis series, diabolically only lasting two matches, is one they now cannot win.\nSA remains the only country in which India has yet to win a Test series.\nFor South Africa this win will provide a much needed boost in morale.\nFor Dean Elgar it was a personal triumph.\n‘It was just my day’: Rabada on his five-star Boxing Day Test day one display Proteas front-line fast bowler Kagiso ‘KG’ Rabada was almost lost for words when asked to describe his masterful, clinical and almost flawless ... Sport 1 week ago Having announced his retirement from Test cricket - a decision partly down to the lack of Test match play for the Proteas in the next few years - he produced one of his best performances in making 185 and anchored the SA first innings in which they scored 408 on a difficult pitch, with overhead conditions also favouring the bowlers.\nHe ended up as captain too with Temba Bavuma not able to take the field because of a hamstring strain he picked up while fielding on the first day.\nThe team’s management, following numerous inquiries over the last few days, finally provided an update on Thursday afternoon, that stated Bavuma was still undergoing “continuous medical assessments.”\nAlthough there’d been speculation about him possibly batting, that was deemed too risky.\nFortunately India’s fragility and the brilliance of SA’s bowlers meant a fourth innings run chase was eliminated.\nRabada finished with 2/32, while debutant Nandre Burger claimed 4/33 and Jansen, despite some struggles with control, took 3/36.\nThere will be concerns about the fielding, with South Africa dropping five catches in the matches, three in India’s second innings.\nBut that is a problem that can be addressed from a position of triumph.",

    "title": "Charles Woodson has shocking take on what position Colorado's Travis Hunter is better at",
    "text": "By Kevin Borba ,\n1 hour ago\nWhen it comes to Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter, he is quite literally the most versatile player in college football.\nHis Paul Hornung Award trophy that he received for dominating this past season on both offense and defense proves just that. While he was viewed as a corner by just about every college coach that recruited him, Deion Sanders always viewed him as a two-way star and is using him as such as he looks to rebuild the Colorado program.\nHowever, while one former two-way star like Sanders thinks Hunter is great at both and should continue to play both, fellow former two-way star Charles Woodson who excelled at Michigan in every way imaginable thinks Hunter should stick to receiver. Not because he isn't a good corner, but because he is just so dominant as a receiver. Woodson also touched on the fact that Hunter is a true two-way player, while he himself had a smaller role than most realize.\n\"He truly plays both ways,\" Woodson explained to Will Compton and Taylor Lewan on Bussin' With The Boys. \"Like a 130 plus plays a game...like I tell people like I dibbled and dabbled on offense and I didn't play a whole lot of offense. It just seems like it.\"\nWoodson finished his college career with 21 catches for 370 yards and three scores, while also rushing two as well. When asked where Hunter's best at, Woods went with his biggest enemy in the NFL, receiver.\n\"I think receiver, I think he's nasty at receiver. I mean he's a good corner don't get me wrong, but I see his offensive skills man...I think his offensive skills dominate over his defensive skills.\"\nRelated: Deion Sanders says Travis Hunter will cause a major problem when he gets to the NFL\nThis past season, Hunter racked up 57 catches for 721 yards and five scores on offense, while totaling 31 tackles, five pass breakups, and nabbing three picks. Based on recent comments from his head coach that urged NFL teams to let Hunter play both ways at the next level, it is safe to assume he will continue to be featured heavily on both sides.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
