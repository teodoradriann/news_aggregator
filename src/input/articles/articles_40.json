Founded by Sourabh Jain in 2023, the app aims to offer sustainable, educational toy subscriptions for children. The investment highlights EleFant's potential to transform India's $1.75 billion toy market. [PTI](/pti-stories)| India | Updated: 05-07-2024 15:34 IST | Created: 05-07-2024 15:34 IST - Country: - United States EleFant, a pioneering mobile app-based toy library, has successfully clinched Rs 6 crore (approximately $750,000) in its seed funding round. Co-led by Malpani Ventures and Venture Catalysts, the funding round also saw participation from notable investors, including Sudhakar Pai and Jyothi Pradhan from Kanara Consumer Products Limited, among others. Founded in 2023 by Sourabh Jain, EleFant arose from the clutter of unused toys and the incessant demand for new ones. The platform aims to provide a continuous stream of engaging, educational toys while promoting sustainability. Jain's vision was driven by his experience as a devoted father, observing his daughter's curiosity. Currently operational in over 16 cities in India, EleFant offers a unique Discover-Play-Return model, significantly changing the traditional toy market. The platform has quickly amassed 13,000+ registered users and 1,000+ fully paid subscribers within ten months of its launch, disrupting the conventional Buy-Play-Clutter approach.

But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "ROMA (ITALPRESS) - \"Attraversiamo una stagione difficile, per molti aspetti drammatica, in cui l'uomo sembra, ostinatamente, proteso a distruggere quel che ha costruito, a vilipendere la propria stessa dignità. Le guerre che si combattono ai confini dell'Europa ci riguardano\". Lo ha detto il presidente della Repubblica, Sergio Mattarella, nel suo intervento alla cerimonia di inaugurazione di Pesaro capitale italiana della cultura 2024.\"Non soltanto perchè il vento delle morti, delle distruzioni, degli odi percorre le distanze ancora più rapidamente di quanto non facciano le armi e incide sulle nostre esistenze, sulle nostre economie e soprattutto sulle nostre coscienze - ha proseguito Mattarella -. Ci riguardano perchè l'Europa, rinata nel dopoguerra, ha iscritto la parola pace nella sua identità. L'Europa è tornata a vivere con la pace e nella pace. La straordinaria stagione di creatività culturale della seconda metà del Novecento è figlia di quella scelta. Quella promessa di pace ha generato libertà e uguaglianza, consentendo anche di rianimare la parola \"fraternità\" - che la Rivoluzione francese aveva issato sui pennoni, e poi oscurata nell'evolvere dei conflitti sociali, dagli insorgenti nazionalismi, dalla pretesa di ridurre \"ad unum\" il volere dei popoli, dalle volontà di potenza. Questioni cruciali, queste, che chiamano alla responsabilità i governanti. Responsabilità che coinvolge le comunità e le persone, non meno degli Stati\".\"La pace è anche un grande tema che riguarda la cultura. La cultura è un lievito che può rigenerare la pace. E con essa i valori umani che le guerre tendono a cancellare, annegandoli nell'odio, nel rancore, nella vendetta, indotti dagli estremismi nazionalistici. In questo momento parlare di cultura, pensare la cultura, trasmettere cultura vuol dire alzare lo sguardo, per un compito di grande portata - ha detto ancora Mattarella -. Perchè la cultura è paziente semina, specialmente nelle nuove generazioni. Perchè la cultura è beneficamente contagiosa e permette di riflettere sulla storia per non ricadere negli errori del passato. Permette di ammirare l'arte, la bellezza, l'ingegno, consapevoli che l'estetica non può separarsi da un'etica di rispetto per la persona\".\"Pesaro si è assunta questo compito, proponendo come tema per il suo anno da capitale: \"La natura della cultura\" - ha proseguito il presidente della Repubblica -. La natura, il suo equilibrio da ricostituire, la riconciliazione con l'ambiente, gravemente violato e sfruttato, sono anch'essi obiettivi urgenti di civiltà e di pace. La distruzione di risorse non può essere gabbellata come sviluppo ma va indicata come regressione. La sostenibilità è un nome della pace. Cultura è conoscenza. Ma anche coscienza. Ci vogliono intelligenza e coraggio per battere strade nuove. Pesaro si propone quest'anno di far interagire arte, natura e tecnologia\", ha aggiunto.- Foto ufficio stampa Quirinale -(ITALPRESS).\nIn Breve\nsabato 20 gennaio\nChe tempo fa\nAccadeva un anno fa\nAttualità\nTI RICORDI COSA È SUCCESSO L’ANNO SCORSO A GENNAIO?\nAscolta il podcast con le notizie da non dimenticare\nAscolta \"Un anno di notizie da non dimenticare\" su Spreaker.",

    "text": "Pope Francis, who has been receiving treatment for double pneumonia at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital since February 14, is now facing an additional health challenge—slight renal insufficiency. The Vatican confirmed that while his condition remains critical, his kidney function is currently under control.\nRespiratory Crisis and Oxygen Therapy\nThe Vatican revealed that Pope Francis recently experienced a prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis, requiring a blood transfusion. However, since last night, he has not faced any further respiratory distress. Doctors have placed him on high-flow oxygen therapy to aid his breathing.\nPast Health Struggles\nAt 88 years old, Pope Francis has battled several health issues in recent years. He is particularly vulnerable to lung infections due to a history of pleurisy, which led to the removal of part of his lung when he was a young adult.\nPublic Prayers and Support\nOutside Gemelli Hospital, well-wishers gathered near the statue of Pope John Paul II, who was also treated at the facility multiple times. Many left flowers, notes, and candles, offering prayers for the pontiff’s recovery.\nDoctors Remain Cautious\nWhile the Vatican assures that Pope Francis is alert and well-oriented, they emphasize that his condition remains complex and requires ongoing medical observation. Doctors are waiting to see how his pharmacological treatments take effect before making any prognosis.\nConclusion\nAs Pope Francis continues his battle with double pneumonia and kidney insufficiency, the world watches and prays for his recovery. His medical team remains vigilant, ensuring he receives the best possible care.",

La decisione è stata presa perché il contenuto del poema è stato considerato offensivo per l'Islam. Il ministro all’istruzione e al merito, Giuseppe Valditara, ha risposto alla polemica inviando un'ispezione alla scuola. La decisione di esentare gli studenti dallo studio del poema ha suscitato un dibattito sulla tensione tra il rispetto delle sensibilità religiose e la salvaguardia del patrimonio culturale e letterario. Alberto Casadei, professore di letteratura all’università di Pisa e coordinatore del gruppo Dante dell’Associazione degli Italianisti, ha criticato la decisione. Secondo Casadei, c'è un equivoco legato alla cosiddetta \"cancel culture\", secondo cui i contenuti di un’opera sarebbero prioritari e, se un artista, uno scrittore o un pittore, considera negativamente una religione, automaticamente va censurato. La questione ha sollevato un dibattito sulla libertà di insegnamento e sulla necessità di rispettare le diverse sensibilità religiose. Mentre alcuni sostengono la decisione della scuola di esentare gli studenti musulmani dallo studio della Divina Commedia, altri la vedono come un atto di autocensura che potrebbe mettere a rischio la salvaguardia del patrimonio culturale e letterario. La questione rimane aperta e il dibattito continua.",

    "text": "Manchester United fans dropped their two cents on Altay Bayindir after he replaced Andre Onana for the Rangers clash in the Europa League at Old Trafford.\nThe Red Devils have seen a turnaround in results in the Europa League since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as Manchester United manager in 2024.\nUnited drew their opening three Europa League matches of the 2024-25 campaign under Erik ten Hag before the Dutchman was axed from Old Trafford last October.\nRuben Amorim picked up three wins in UEFA’s second-tier club competition ahead of Rangers arriving at Old Trafford for their match on Thursday evening.\nThe 39-year-old United manager watched the Red Devils suffer their first defeat of 2025 last Sunday with a 3-1 Premier League defeat to Brighton at Old Trafford.\nREAD MORE: Roy Keane reveals ‘frosty’ confrontation with Man Utd legend happened only once ‘in 12 years,’ both ‘went after each other’\nBayindir starts for Man Utd at Old Trafford\nAndre Onana was on the receiving end of a howler last weekend against Brighton and the Manchester United No 1’s mistake allowed Georginio Rutter to score.\nThe 28-year-old United shot-stopper showed promise at the start of the 2024-25 season, but Onana’s form and consistency took a major hit towards the end of 2024.\nRuben Amorim made the big call to drop Onana after his sloppy error against the Seagulls and he turned to Altay Bayindir for the Rangers clash.\nBayindir has had his own low points this season, including conceding from a direct corner in the Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat to Tottenham last December.\nHowever, the 26-year-old Turkish shot-stopper redeemed himself earlier this month with his superb performance against Arsenal in the third-round FA Cup win.\nDespite his heroics against the Gunners at the Emirates, Bayindir was dropped to the bench and Onana played in the win over Southampton and in the defeat to Brighton.\nBayindir returned between the sticks and the Turkey international put in a strong showing in the first half against Rangers at Old Trafford on Thursday evening.\nThe ex-Fenerbahce man, who was signed by former United manager Erik ten Hag in 2023, continued his strong display in the second half when he was called upon.\nHowever, Bayindir’s effort to secure a clean sheet was undone after United conceded at the hands of Rangers forward Cyriel Dessers in the 88th minute.\nREAD MORE: Denis Irwin singles out only Man Utd legend who was even comparable to Roy Keane, he was ‘tough’ and ‘aggressive’\nMan Utd fans react to Bayindir’s display vs Rangers\nRed Devils fans on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, praised Bayindir for a solid performance between the sticks against Rangers.\nOne United supporter insisted that “it’s only a matter of time” before Bayindir takes Onana’s spot as the No 1, with other Red Devils fans echoing the sentiment.\nAn X user wrote: “Bayindir in the post looks more comfortable than Onana. He deserves to be our first [choice] ‘keeper.”\nAnother said: “I’m more and more convinced that Altay Bayindir is our No 1, not Andre Onana!”\nSomeone else commented: “Bayindir has been impressive so far, and with performances like this, it’s only a matter of time before Amorim decides to bench Onana.”\n“Onana would’ve conceded that corner that Bayindir saved,” a fourth fan posted.\nWhile a fifth tweeted: “Bayindir makes me feel much more confident and comfortable when corners come in or shots.”\nSomebody else argued: “Why aren’t we playing Bayindir every week? He’s better than Onana and it’s not even close.”\nA seventh suggested: “Common knowledge: Bayindir should start over Onana.”\n“I actually think Bayindir is better than Onana,” another added.",
