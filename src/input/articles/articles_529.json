    "text": "Kilgore man ‘refuses to be victim,’ fights back against machete-armed home intruders, police say KILGORE, Texas (KLTV) - Kilgore police report an arrest resulting from a home invasion that occurred on Wednesday night. The alleged invasion happened at an apartment in the 600 block of Harris Street, according to police. When officers responded to a 911 call for help there, they learned that two teenage boys, ages 18 and 17, that the residents knew, had come to the apartment to assault one of the apartment’s residents. Police say the issued reportedly centered around a stolen nicotine vape. When the two males entered the apartment, the male resident had injuries, but “refused to be a victim,” they said. During the assault, the residence owner tried to defend her brother, and she was injured. By the time police were at the scene, the two males had fled. Gregg County Sheriff’s Office and Rusk County Sheriff’s Office deputies helped Kilgore police to create a perimeter around the suspect’s residence on Broadway. Both of the suspects were called to leave the residence, which they did, and were interviewed by officers. They were placed in custody for burglary of a habitation. Their weapon, a machete, was taken as evidence, police say, and they were booked into the Kilgore Municipal Jail. Copyright 2024 KLTV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "(ESPECIAL) [EL UNIVERSAL.-](https://www.google.com/search?as_sitesearch=elsiglodetorreon.com.mx&q=EL UNIVERSAL.-) Una mujer se volvió viral en redes sociales, luego de criticar a la tienda Walmart por vender \"plantas anticristianas\" en un \"país cristiano\" para la celebración de Año Nuevo. Por medio de la plataforma X, el usuario @ZuritaCarpio compartió el video donde se aprecia a una mujer lanzar una fuerte crítica a la famosa tienda departamental por su artículo para fin de año, sin especificar la sucursal. \"Estoy viendo estas cosas, fíjense, eh, en un país cristiano, unos elefantes con la trompa para arriba, con una planta y trae unas monedas, dice que es la planta de la abundancia, pero esto es totalmente anticristiano\", expresó la mujer. Aunado a ello, señaló que la tienda es parte del nuevo gobierno globalista. \"Un Walmart que es parte del nuevo gobierno mundial globalista, parte de estas corporaciones, siempre vendiendo cosas en contra del cristianismo, siempre fomentando muchísimo el Halloween y toda la serie de descristianización\". Finalmente, aseveró que \"a lo único que no se han atrevido es a poner cosas Queer y LGBT para la ropa de los niños, no lo dudo que ya estén haciendo aquí esto\". ¿Cuánto cuestan las plantas de la abundancia en Walmart? De acuerdo con el sitio de Walmart, la planta de la abundancia con maceta de elefante ronda un precio de 149 pesos; sin embargo, actualmente se encuentra agotado el producto. ¿Para qué sirve la planta de la abundancia? La planta de la abundancia, también conocida como planta de jade o árbol de jade, es una planta suculenta de origen africano que se caracteriza por sus hojas carnosas y redondas, que se asemejan a monedas. Esta planta se ha asociado tradicionalmente con la prosperidad y la buena fortuna, y es por ello que se suele colocar en el hogar o en el lugar de trabajo para atraer estas energías positivas. Según el Feng Shui, la planta de la abundancia debe colocarse en la esquina sureste de la habitación, que es la zona de la riqueza y la prosperidad. También se recomienda colocarla en un lugar con buena iluminación, pero evitando la luz directa del sol. Además de sus propiedades simbólicas, la planta de la abundancia también tiene algunos beneficios prácticos. Es una planta relativamente fácil de cuidar, ya que requiere poca agua y luz. También es una planta muy resistente, por lo que puede sobrevivir en condiciones adversas.",

    "text": "HAWTHORNE (KABC) -- Lithographix, a commercial printing and communications company in Hawthorne, wants to help get the word out. Through a program with the California department of rehabilitation, they've begun hiring people with disabilities and people re-entering the workforce. Steve Cody is the senior manufacturing manager. \"When people hear disabled, they think 'Oh, they wouldn't fit into my place of business.' But that's not true,\" said Cody. \"And then people re-entering the workforce, obviously these people are looking for a second chance. And we found that these people are, not only grateful to get jobs in great companies. But they're very hardworking and very dependable people.\" Be Moody is a pre-press apprentice at Llithographix. she says the department of rehabilitation helps people with disabilities find jobs, which is what happened for her. And she wants others to know there's help available. \"There are a lot of people that I know who would qualify as disabled and they don't think they can get a job that would be better suited for them because of their experience. But, I think if they work with places like the California Department of Rehabilitation that they would be able to find a job that's better for them,\" said Moody. Leonard Cornish also commends the department of rehabilitation for the help they give to people who were previously incarcerated. He says his biggest challenge was having a gap in his work experience, but Lithographix gave him a chance. \"Some of us don't have the work experience like that, so Lithographix just let us come in with open arms and what we don't know, they're willing to teach. It's just a great opportunity,\" said Cornish. Cody says he hopes more employers will consider hiring through the department of rehabilitation. \"There's people out there that really want to work hard and really are good people and giving them a chance, not only helps your business, but, like I say, just from inside, makes you feel really good when you're giving somebody a second chance.\"",
