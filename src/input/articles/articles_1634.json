    "title": "Wisconsin's job market strong, with a record 3 million people working",
    "text": "Wisconsin’s economy ended 2023 in good shape with businesses hiring workers and the state’s unemployment rate at 3.3%, lower than the national average of 3.7%.\nJobs and employment data is still being gathered for December. However officials with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development said that in November the state had more than 3 million people working, which is a new high for the state, and in the month 1,700 employees were added to the workforce.\nIn 2023, roughly 32,300 workers entered the workforce in Wisconsin.\nThe biggest problem with the economy has been there aren’t enough bodies to fill the openings.\n“As the Baby Boomers age out, we find that we need more and more workers just in general,” said Scott Hodek, Section Chief for DWD's Office of Economic Advisors, “This is the big piece that we’re seeing influence the workforce and the economy into the next decades.”\nMore: These 6 companies laid people off in November in Wisconsin\nHodek made his comments during the department’s virtual economic briefing in December.\n“Students, right now graduating, have a great job market,” Hodek said. “We saw we’re getting more people into the labor force, and that’s good, but we need more.”\nAnd while the job market is in workers favor, there might be some signs of hiring slowing down.\nAccording to the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association and Commerce's most recent data from October, Milwaukee metro area employment averaged 862,000, a 0.3% increase from one year ago.\n“A weakened overall employment trend, as well as negative manufacturing and unemployment indicators, suggest a sluggish metro area economy,” Bret Mayborne, MMAC vice president of economic research, said in the monthly report. “On the positive side, local housing and real estate indicators may be on the mend after registering declines for the better part of two years.”\nThere are still some workers who received bad news this year.\nIn December only one employer filed a WARN notice with the state: Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc., based in Brookfield, informed 17 remote workers that they would be laid off beginning Feb. 16.\nIn 2023, 6,727 workers learned they would need to find a new job, which is up from 5,563 a year ago, and up from 2,888 in 2021.\nBut that annual number is a fraction of the 39,756 workers that were laid off in 2020.",

    "title": "Guillaume Vierset Edges, « Live in Paris » : comme de la lave - Le Soir",
    "text": "Le groupe belge Edges est volcanique. Ce concert est une bombe. . Critique - Journaliste au pôle Culture Par Jean-Claude Vantroyen Publié le 28/12/2023 à 22:35 Temps de lecture: 1 min Igloo Records, uniquement en numérique sur igloorecords.be/album/live-in-paris-guillaume-vierset-edges/ Je me souviens avec enthousiasme du concert que l’Edges de Guillaume Vierset avait donné à l’AB, le 17 mai 2023 : c’était électrique, dense, entier, énergique et fort, plus rock que jazz même. Le guitariste belge était accompagné de Dorian Dumont aux claviers, Teun Verbruggen à la batterie et Matteo Mazzù à la basse. Quelques jours plus tôt, le 10, le groupe était à l’Ermitage à Paris. Avec Jozef Dumoulin aux claviers et Antoine Pierre à la batterie, là. Et si l’ambiance était la même, survoltée, puissante, vigoureuse, avec des plages de calme relatif, c’était une autre dimension, pas supérieure : différente. Les envolées de Dumoulin se tendent vers l’espace, les riffs de Pierre rugissent comme des volcans. Et toujours la basse implacable de Mazzù et la guitare tantôt brûlante comme de la lave tantôt brutale de Vierset. Un grand moment, ce concert, si l’on en croit les cinq morceaux choisis pour cet EP uniquement numérique. Quatre viennent de leur album The end of the f***ing world , le cinquième, We’ll Back , est nouveau. Et annonce sans doute un album prochain. On est impatient.",

    "title": "Editorials | Volunteer fighters are a difficult issue for the state",
    "text": "Editorials | Volunteer fighters are ready to risk or even sacrifice their lives for Ukraine. However, official Finland does not take them into account.\nS Uoman volunteer fighter Ville Mykkänen fell in August in Ukraine fighting against the Russians. Mykkäse became the fifth Finn to crash in Ukraine. His death received more attention than usual because the family published an obituary on Facebook about the man who, before going to war, had been the chairman of the central youth of North Ostrobothnia.\nAntti Kaikkonen, the center’s new chairman memory Mute the messaging service in X. “Ville was a solid creator and defender of justice. My warm condolences to Ville’s loved ones and strength for the grief work,” Kaikkonen wrote.\nKaikkonen’s message, who previously also served as defense minister, was so far the most authoritative public reaction to the downfall of Finnish fighters. Mykkänen’s party background explained the attention. So far, official Finland has been largely silent about both the Finns who left for Ukraine and their deaths. Instead, there has been an outpouring of sympathy from ordinary citizens. In the comments of the obituary on Facebook, Mykkäs was praised as a deceased hero.\nThe situation is special, because Finland strongly supports Ukraine politically, economically and militarily. Finland exports weapons to Ukraine and has not objected to using them even on Russian soil. Many decision-makers have reminded that the Ukrainians are also defending Finland and the rest of Europe with their fight. From that point of view, the distance official Finland keeps from these volunteer fighters seems contradictory.\nHowever, there are understandable reasons for the chosen line. Although Finland supports the fight in Ukraine together with other Western countries, they have all drawn a clear line on sending soldiers.\nThe same is done in Estonia, for example, although there are differences. Estonia pays for the repatriation of fallen volunteers, while in Finland it is the responsibility of volunteer organizations. Recognition has also been given. When the first Estonian, Ivo Jurak, fell in Ukraine in 2023, Kusti Salm, chief of staff of the Ministry of Defense, wrote: “It was about a brave soldier who defended the freedom of Ukraine.” At the same time, however, Salm emphasized that Estonia does not encourage volunteer fighters to go to Ukraine.\nNo one should be encouraged to participate in the war in Ukraine, when the state does not take any responsibility for those who leave. The government’s comments could be interpreted as encouragement. That also explains the silence.\nS volunteer associations, such as Your Finnish Friends and Sodan kokeneet, have been established to provide peer support for Uoman volunteers. The executive director of the latter, Juha Kreus, told ( HS 19.8. ), that he has only one instruction for those planning to go to Ukraine: don’t go. Despite the warnings, some still go to war. It is estimated that some tens or early two hundred volunteer fighters have gone to Ukraine from Finland. The exact number is not known.\nPeople who leave have many reasons for their decision, such as their life situation, the search for excitement or worldview issues. In interviews with volunteer fighters, the need to seek a sense of meaning in life has been highlighted.\n“\nDespite the warnings, some go to war.\nSimilar motives have undoubtedly been behind other people who went to different wars, for example the nearly 19,000 foreigners who fought as volunteers for Finland in 1939–1944.\nThe attitude towards those who go to war always depends on the political situation. It can also be seen in the designations available to them, such as mercenary, foreign fighter and volunteer fighter. The attitude towards volunteers can also change over time.\nJ The Estonian “boys of Finland” who fought in Finnish uniforms in the Atko War were a long-shunned topic in both Estonian and Finnish historiography. Now they are heroes. During his visit to Estonia in May, the President of the Republic, Alexander Stubb, laid a wreath at the Estonian volunteers’ memorial.\nSo it is not impossible that the day will come when the president of Ukraine pays respect to Ville Mykkänen and others who fell for a free and independent Ukraine during his visit to Finland.\nThe editorials are HS’s positions on a current topic. The articles are prepared by HS’s editorial department, and they reflect the journal principle line.\n#Editorials #Volunteer #fighters #difficult #issue #state",
