    "text": "Многие владельцы смартфонов на Android со временем замечают, что батарея разряжается быстрее обычного. Часто причина кроется в отдельных функциях, которые не только потребляют много энергии, но и отслеживают действия пользователя, отмечает один из техноблогеров YouTube.\nЧтобы отключить такие функции, откройте «Настройки» → «Защита и конфиденциальность» → «Специальные разрешения» → «Доступ к данным об использовании».Далее:\nЗайдите в «Цифровое благополучие» и отключите доступ к истории использования. Сделайте то же самое для Analytics. Отключите доступ у Device Health Services.\nПродолжение истории после рекламы\nЭти сервисы постоянно отслеживают активность на смартфоне, что ускоряет разрядку аккумулятора.\nПродлить время работы батареи помогут и другие меры:\nвключение режима энергосбережения; снижение яркости экрана; отключение Wi-Fi и GPS, если они не нужны; ограничение фоновой активности приложений (в настройках в разделе «Приложения» уберите галочку напротив «Разрешить работу в фоновом режиме»).\nВыполнив эти шаги, можно заметно сократить расход энергии и увеличить время работы устройства без подзарядки.\nПродолжение истории после рекламы\nЮжный автомобиль: последние новости Чем пользоваться вместо WhatsApp и Telegram: объяснил эксперт Харитонов",

The [Gladys Prior Career Teaching Award](https://www.unf.edu/coehs/scholarships/gladys-prior-award-winners.html#:~:text=The%20Gladys%20Prior%20Awards%20for%20Career%20Teaching%20Excellence%20are%20among,Ortega%20Elementary%20School%2C%20Gladys%20Prior.) bestows $15,000 for each teacher. The 2024 award winners are John E. Ford Pre K-8 School teacher Susan Morgan; Lake Lucina Elementary School teacher Jesica Pearce, LaVilla School of The Arts teacher Kristi St. John and Loretto Elementary School teacher Ilyssa Tomlinson. The quartet have more than 90 years of combined teaching experience, the university said in a press release. “The UNF College of Education and Human Services is honored to manage the Gladys Prior Career Teaching Awards and have a part in honoring educators who are making a significant impact in our community,” said UNF COEHS Interim Dean Jennifer Kane. “We are very appreciative of Gilchrist Berg for his continued commitment to recognize and award our local educators.\" The Gladys Prior Awards for Career Teaching Excellence were established in 1998 by Berg, founder and president of [Water Street Capital](https://wscapital.com/), to honor teachers with lifelong careers in education. The past 26 years, Berg has given more than $2 million to honor Jacksonville teachers. The award is named after Berg’s fourth-grade teacher at Ortega Elementary School, Gladys Prior. UNF’s COEHS manages the gift and arranges the annual surprise award for each teacher at their school surrounded by students, faculty and staff, according to the university.",

The riches come from the lives they touch — and change.\nEleven teachers in Minnesota are finalists for Teacher of the Year in high school, elementary and even kindergarten classrooms.\nYes, kindergarten.\nSo, how does one get the nod as perhaps the best in the state by teaching 5- and 6-year-olds?\nKARE 11's Breaking the News anchor, Jana Shortal, went to Alice Smith Elementary in Hopkins to find out.\n\"My people\"\nWhen the line shuffles into this classroom every morning, all of them know this is where they want to be.\nIt took Ellen Wu exactly one year of teaching sixth grade to figure out she was actually a kindergarten teacher.\n\"Why are you a kindergarten teacher?\" asked Shortal.\n\"Because they are my people,\" Wu said with a laugh, adding, \"They are hilarious; they show up as themselves and we get to play, grow and learn together every single day.\"\nThis state-recognized class also reveals something else Miss Wu does as a part of her curriculum.\n\"I love her smiles and I love how she dances with us when we do brain breaks,\" said student Sasha.\n\"She's really good at it,\" said student Cora.\nWu is setting the foundation for the kids' educational career. She shows them how to sit still, how to take turns — and how to be right alongside her.\n\"What makes a teacher good?\" asked Shortal.\n\"I know!\" a student said excitedly. \"She hangs out with her children and likes to teach them.\"\n\"They go from not knowing how to line up, not knowing how to hold a pencil to becoming readers, writers and mathematicians,\" said Wu.\nBittersweet goodbyes\nApproaching the end of this school year and inevitably moving on from Miss Wu, the teacher and her students agree: The future is bittersweet.\nAs Wu said, they are her people, and after visiting with the class, Jana ultimately learned, Wu is theirs, too.\n\"Who is the most favorite teacher you've ever had?\" asked Shortal.\nIn unison and with no hesitation, the kids answered, \"Miss Wu!\"\nThe annual awards ceremony will be held May 5 in St. Paul.\nWATCH MORE ON KARE 11+\n[Download the free KARE 11+ app](/article/about-us/kare-11-news-free-and-on-demand-on-roku-and-fire-tv/89-5efa72e4-8993-4449-8eb4-dea4a1d22873) for Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV and other smart TV platforms to watch more from KARE 11 anytime!

    "text": "[](https://euro.dayfr.com/content/uploads/2024/09/19/67d4b2876f.jpg) Felice Mazzu’s reign at Anderlecht did not last long. But he still had time to participate in the emergence of Julien Duranville. Before Brian Riemer took over the reins of the team, until today, it was Felice Mazzu who was still at the helm at Anderlecht. Today on the bench of Sint-Truiden after a brief detour from Charleroi, he explains to VoetbalNieuws that he was particularly marked by Julien Duranville. The alien from Neerpede was only 16 when Mazzu arrived at Lotto Park. He had just received his first minutes with the senior team thanks to Vincent Kompany in the last match of the Playoffs the previous season. Under the new coach, Duranville continued to show what he was made of with the first team, until he got a taste of the European Cup. “Julien, pfff… He was exceptional. He was impressive and unstoppable. What he showed in training was incredible. Julien showed that during games too. I remember bringing him on against OHL, when we were down 1-2, and he scored a fantastic goal,” Mazzu recalls. Red Devil at 18 The Trudonnaire coach is happy to see the development of his former protégé: ‘With the Red Devils, he also showed what qualities he has. He just has to find a balance between playing simply and knowing when to dribble. But when he does it and it works… My God, what a magnificent player he is. He is lightning fast, but can, in a square metre, pull off incredible technical moves with his good little feet, like a backheel or something else. He is a brilliant footballer.’ Now in Dortmund, Julien Duranville is asserting himself as a player but also as a man: “Julien was still a shy boy at Anderlecht, someone who didn’t talk much. He was very kind and humble. A really good boy.” Felice Mazzu concludes: “If he is spared from injuries, he will become an exceptional player.",

    "title": "Alberto Fernández no fue abucheado a su llegada a España, es un vídeo en Buenos Aires en 2016",
    "text": "¿Qué verificamos?\nEl expresidente argentino Alberto Fernández es abucheado a su llegada a España.\nConclusión\nEl vídeo se grabó en un centro comercial de Buenos Aires en julio de 2016.\nEFE Madrid |\nUn vídeo en el que expresidente de Argentina Alberto Fernández es abucheado e increpado no ocurrió a su llegada este diciembre a España ni es actual, como aseguran falsamente mensajes en redes sociales, ya que se grabó en un centro comercial de Buenos Aires en 2016.\n«Así recibieron al remisero Alberto Fernández en España». Este es el mensaje ampliamente difundido en\nFacebook, X (antiguamente conocida como Twitter) y Tik T ok que acompaña a un vídeo de varias personas vociferando e insultando al que fuera presidente de Argentina entre 2019 y 2023.\nEn un momento de la grabación se ve a Fernández encararse con una persona que lo increpa mientras su esposa, Fabiola Yáñez, intenta calmarlo.\nLas imágenes comenzaron a circular después de que Fernández viajase a España para pasar las vacaciones de Navidad con su familia, según\nanunció el político en sus redes sociales.\nNo es España ni es actual\nLo cierto es que las imágenes, aunque son reales, no corresponden a la llegada de Fernández a España ni son actuales, porque se grabaron en un centro comercial de la capital argentina en 2016.\nUna búsqueda inversa del vídeo conduce a publicaciones de varios medios de comunicación argentinos que el 8 de julio de 2016 informaron de que Fernández fue increpado e insultado en el centro comercial Patio Bullrich de Buenos Aires.\nEn declaraciones a un programa del canal\nC5N, Fernández relató que se encontraba haciendo cola para comprar una entrada al cine cuando un hombre le empezó a insultar.\nSegún\nLa Nación, varias personas se unieron al escrache y Fernández tuvo que ser asistido por un agente de policía. Tras los hechos, el exmandatario aseguró en el canal de noticias TN que el agresor era «un perfecto energúmeno». «Hice un enorme esfuerzo por no reaccionar. No fue un escrache, este tipo es un delirante que generó un clima hostil en un lugar donde la gente fue a pasear», indicó\nYa había circulado descontextualizado\nEste mismo contenido ha sido difundido en otras ocasiones de forma descontextualizada. En mayo de 2019 circuló junto a mensajes que sugerían que las imágenes eran recientes.\n«Mira!!! Alberto Fernández Presidente y CFK (Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) ya demuestra el cariño de la gente a su paso», señaló un usuario en\nX (antiguo Twitter) después de que Fernández de Kirchner anunciase su fórmula electoral con Alberto Fernández como precandidato a presidente y ella misma como precandidata a la vicepresidencia para las elecciones de ese año.\nEste contenido circuló de nuevo en agosto de 2021 tras las críticas que recibió Fernández por organizar una fiesta de cumpleaños en 2020 cuando su país se encontraba bajo restricciones sanitarias por la pandemia, según el medio digital\neldiario.\nEn definitiva, es falso que el expresidente argentino fuese abucheado a su llegada a España en diciembre de 2023, ya que el vídeo en el que se apoyan los mensajes engañosos fue grabado en 2016 en un centro comercial de la ciudad de Buenos Aires.\nFuentes:\nBúsqueda inversa de imagen con Google.

    "text": "Four days after Bobbie Jean Carter died at 41 years on Saturday, December 23, new details are coming to light about how she passed away. The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office told TMZ that first responders were dispatched to Carter's Tampa, Fla., home on Saturday morning, where they found her and rushed her to the hospital. She was later declared dead. The sheriff said deputies learned Bobbie Jean was on probation for cocaine possession when she died, but her roommates told the authorities she hadn't used any narcotics since she was released from prison. The deputies did not find any narcotics or drug paraphernalia in Bobbie Jean's bedroom or bathroom, and there were no signs of foul play. Bobbie Jean's death is under investigation, and her official cause of death will be determined later by the Medical Examiner's Office, as they are still waiting for toxicology results. “Our office conducted the autopsy, and we are awaiting family to make arrangements to have her released from our facility,” a rep for the Florida medical examiner told RadarOnline.com . “Autopsy reports may take four to five months or longer to complete,” the rep added. As OK! previously reported, Aaron Carter also tragically died in the same way after drowning in his bathtub. According to the autopsy report, the \"I Want Candy\" singer, who passed away in 2022, took Xanax and huffing compressed air before submerging into the water. Bobbie Jean's mother, is now taking care of her granddaughter, 8-year-old Bella . Jane Carter , who also lost daughter Leslie Carter in 2012, gave a statement about Bobbie Jean following the sad news. Never miss a story — sign up for the OK! newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer. It’s gossip too good to wait for! \"I am in shock from learning of the sudden death of my daughter, Bobbie Jean, and I will need time to process the terrible reality of this happening for the third time,\" Jane stated. \"[H]owever deeply a parent feels the loss of a child, the suffering of a young child at the loss of a parent must be much greater,” she added. “So, I would ask the sympathetic to say a prayer for my precious eight-year-old granddaughter Bella, who previously lost her father and is now also left without her mother. When I am able to think clearly, I’ll release a fuller statement, but until then, I would request to be left to grieve in private.\"",
