    "text": "VW kehrt Elektroauto-Namenskonzept den Rücken: ID-Modelle ohne Zukunft\nVolkswagen verzückt die Belegschaft mit einem Strategiewechsel bei den Elektroautos. Die Maßnahme könnte E-Mobilität in Deutschland einen weiteren Schub geben.\nWolfsburg/München – Im Automobilbereich ist ein Name mehr als nur ein Etikett – er ist auch ein Stück Geschichte. Volkswagen setzt demnächst auf die Kraft der Tradition und verabschiedet sich offenbar von der aktuellen Modellbezeichnung für Elektroautos.\nDer Konzern hat einem Bericht zufolge auf einer Betriebsversammlung im Stammwerk Wolfsburg eine bedeutende Änderung angekündigt: E-Autos der nächsten Generation werden künftig nicht mehr nach dem bisherigen Muster benannt.\nVW mit neuer E-Auto-Strategie: Modellnamen mit traditionellen Wurzeln\nVW-Markenchef Thomas Schäfer erklärte laut der Wolfsburger Allgemeinen, dass „ikonische Namen“ nicht sterben dürfen und der ID-Name für neue Modelle ausläuft.\nDie Entscheidung würde das Ende einer Ära markieren, die unter dem früheren Vorstandschef Herbert Diess (bis 2022 im Amt) begann. Damals wurde mit dem ID.3 das Pendant zum klassischen Golf als erstes Modell einer eigenen Elektro-Familie vorgestellt.\nDie ID-Buchstaben standen laut einer 2019 veröffentlichten Pressemitteilung für „intelligentes Design“ und „Identität“ – und sollten die neuen Stromer mit visionären Technologien klar von den Verbrennermodellen abgrenzen. Dass sich diesbezüglich eine Änderung anbahnt, berichtete Ippen.Media vor einigen Monaten.\nVolkswagen ändert E-Auto-Namen: Was bedeutet das für aktuelle Modelle?\nDass bereits die bestehenden Modellnamen der elektrischen Fahrzeuge aus Wolfsburg angepasst werden, wäre ein ungewöhnlicher Schritt. Eine entsprechende Anfrage der Autobild dazu blieb von Volkswagen unbeantwortet.\nVor wenigen Jahren läutete die ID-Familie bei Volkswagen eine neue Ära ein. Doch weder die Verkaufszahlen noch die Akzeptanz der Modelle konnten gänzlich überzeugen. Die Rückbesinnung auf klassische Namen wie Golf, Polo und Tiguan könnte den Elektroautos von VW einen vertrauteren Anstrich geben – und bei der Belegschaft im Stammwerk sei die Ankündigung gut angekommen, schildert der Bericht.\nVW kehrt bei Modellnamen für Elektroautos zu den Wurzeln zurück\nViele Kundinnen und Kunden identifizieren sich stärker mit den altbekannten Modellnamen: Ein Golf bleibt eben ein Golf – auch wenn er elektrisch fährt und die Bezeichnung ID.3 trägt. Die Rückkehr zu traditionellen Bezeichnungen könnte daher nicht nur das Markenimage stärken, sondern auch die Nachfrage nach Elektroautos ankurbeln. Gleiches gilt für geplante Änderungen beim Design.\nMit dem neuen Elektro-Kleinwagen, der in wenigen Monaten startet, will VW laut der Wolfsburger Allgemeinen bereits auf die neue Namensgebung setzen. Anstatt ID.2 könnte das neue Einstiegsmodell als VW E-Polo oder womöglich ID.Polo an den Start gehen. Derweil erweisen sich in Deutschland produzierte E-Modelle zunehmend als Exportschlager. (PF)",

    "text": "By George Sessions ,\n22 minutes ago Tottenham Hotspur manager Ange Postecoglou during the UEFA Europa League, league stage match at the PreZero Arena in Sinsheim, Germany. Picture date: Thursday January 23, 2025. PA Wire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou hailed a captain’s display from Son Heung-min after a 3-2 win at Hoffenheim before he revealed the club’s latest injury blow, with Dominic Solanke ruled out until March.\nA brace from Son in Germany fired Spurs to a much-needed victory after a run of five defeats from their previous eight matches.\nPostecoglou was without 14 players for the Europa League clash due to a combination of injuries and ineligibility, with Solanke one of those sidelined after he sustained a knee issue in training last Saturday.\nAsked how long the £65million forward would be out, Postecoglou admitted: “With Dom, the information now is that we are looking at around the six-week mark.\n“No surgery. Maybe we can get him back a little bit earlier, just see how he progresses, but at this stage it’s saying around six weeks.”\nWhile Postecoglou was able to hand the recently fit-again Richarlison his first start since October, Solanke’s prolonged absence is a hammer blow, especially with crucial Carabao Cup and FA Cup fixtures to come in February.\nA precious victory away to Hoffenheim does mean Tottenham should avoid the prospect of more fixtures in February, with a top-eight finish in the Europa League almost secured, which would send them directly through to the last-16 phase in March.\nVice-captain James Maddison was the first of Postecoglou’s senior figures to step up with a third-minute opener before the England playmaker played in Son to fire home via a deflection after 22 minutes.\nHoffenheim rallied and reduced the deficit in the 68th-minute through Anton Stach, but Son seemed to ensure there would be no dramatic finale with a fine finish nine minutes later.\nI could not speak highly enough of the players carrying us through\nAnge Postecoglou David Mokwa’s 88th-minute header did make Tottenham sweat before they sealed a fourth triumph in Europe with five teenagers on the pitch at full-time after academy graduates Mikey Moore, Callum Olusesi and Will Lankshear were sent on to join starting duo Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.\n“I thought Sonny led from the front tonight with his football but also with his general actions and most importantly the goals,” Postecoglou said.\n“Look, we are all copping stick at the moment. That is the nature of the beast. What we do, as footballers and managers, we are all in the firing line at the moment. Whether it is warranted or not, you have to stand up and reply to it in the proper way. I thought he did that tonight.\n“I thought Madders was outstanding tonight. These players are exhausted, mate. They are professional footballers who are just 24/7 trying to recover right now. All of them. They are giving everything.\n“It should not be dismissed that I had five teenagers. We are a Premier League outfit playing in an away game in Europe and we had five teenagers out there.\n“It is pretty much unheard of in an important game, not a dead rubber and that goes to show the load these guys are willing to take on themselves without making excuses.\n“I could not speak highly enough of the players carrying us through. They will get some help hopefully soon with some players coming back.\n“We are in a real good position in Europe. Get to the knockout rounds home and away, get our players back and we will back ourselves against anyone.”",

    "title": "Is Cape Town a developed city?",
    "text": "Is Cape Town a developed city?\nCape Town is indeed a developed city. It is a major political and economic center with high-rise office buildings and pedestrian malls. The city’s reputation is built on its beautiful location between mountains and the sea, its cosmopolitan population, and the liberal outlook of its citizens.\nWhy is Cape Town so developed?\nCape Town’s development can be attributed to its rich and diverse history, dating back to its days as a Dutch colony in the 1600s. The city has been controlled by various powers, including the British, Afrikaaners, and South Africans, which has resulted in a unique blend of European and African influences in its culture.\nWhat is the most developed city in South Africa?\nJohannesburg is considered the most developed city in South Africa. It is known as the wealthiest city in Africa and offers a range of amenities on par with first-world countries. Johannesburg’s development can be traced back to the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886.\nIs Cape Town rich or poor?\nCape Town has a mix of wealth and poverty. While it is a developed city, with high-rise buildings and a thriving economy, it also faces challenges of poverty and unemployment. In recent years, the city has seen an increase in unemployment rates, reaching 29% in 2021, likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIs Cape Town a first world city?\nAlthough South Africa as a whole is not considered a first-world country, Cape Town is often regarded as a first-world city within a third-world country. It offers modern infrastructure, amenities, and a high standard of living compared to other parts of the country.\nIs Cape Town safe or not?\nCape Town, like any major city, has its safety concerns. While certain areas may have higher crime rates, the city as a whole can be considered safe as long as individuals maintain a level of awareness and follow basic personal security protocols.\nIs Cape Town a slum?\nCape Town is not a slum, but like many cities, it does have informal settlements or shanty towns. These are areas where a significant portion of the population lives in impoverished conditions, with limited access to basic services such as water, electricity, and sanitation.\nIs Cape Town really cheap?\nCape Town is known for offering great value for money, especially when it comes to dining out. While it may be slightly more expensive than other parts of South Africa, visitors can still enjoy a range of activities and experiences at affordable prices.\nWhich is the cleanest city in Africa?\nKigali, the capital of Rwanda, is often regarded as the cleanest city in Africa. The city has made significant efforts to prioritize cleanliness and sustainability, making it a standout in the continent.\nWhich city is the richest in Africa?\nJohannesburg, South Africa’s commercial capital, is considered the richest city in Africa. It is home to the largest number of dollar millionaires on the continent and boasts a thriving economy.\nWhat is the most white city in South Africa?\nPort Elizabeth is the largest white population center in South Africa, with over half of the Eastern Cape’s white population residing there. Other major white populations can be found in East London, Grahamstown, Graaff-Reinet, and several smaller towns.\nWhat is the biggest problem in Cape Town?\nCape Town faces several challenges, including racism, climate change, affordability and access to choices, economic exclusion, gangsterism and crime, state failure in other government spheres, and wild cards that may impact the city’s future.\nWhich is better Cape Town or Johannesburg?\nWhether Cape Town or Johannesburg is better depends on individual preferences. Cape Town offers a laid-back lifestyle, beautiful beaches, and a rich cultural scene. Johannesburg, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant nightlife, bustling atmosphere, and economic opportunities. It ultimately comes down to what you’re looking for in a city.\nWhat language do they speak in Cape Town?\nIn Cape Town, a significant portion of the population speaks Afrikaans, Xhosa, and English. Afrikaans is an official language in South Africa and is derived from Dutch. Xhosa is one of the country’s official languages and is primarily spoken by the Xhosa ethnic group. English is widely spoken and understood.\nWhat is the poorest city in South Africa?\nAlfred Nzo Municipality in the Eastern Cape has been identified as the poorest municipality in South Africa. More than 90% of the population in this area earns the lowest income. On the other end of the spectrum, Johannesburg is one of the wealthiest districts in the country.\nWhat is the lifestyle in Cape Town?\nCape Town offers a unique and diverse lifestyle. It is known for its dramatic natural beauty, cultural diversity, and a wide range of activities. The city provides opportunities to swim with penguins, climb mountains, sample award-winning wines, and enjoy a world-class infrastructure.\nWhat do South Africans call slums?\nIn South Africa, the term “slum” is not commonly used due to its political implications. Instead, the preferred terms to describe impoverished areas are “informal settlements” or “squatter camps.” This shift in terminology reflects the country’s history and the government’s efforts to address housing and social issues.\nWhich is safer Johannesburg or Cape Town?\nWhile both cities have their safety concerns, Cape Town has a higher murder rate compared to Johannesburg. However, it is important to note that crime can occur in any city, and individuals should exercise caution and be aware of their surroundings regardless of their location.\nIs it safe to walk around downtown Cape Town?\nDuring the day, it is generally safe to walk around downtown Cape Town, especially in touristy areas like Bo-Kaap, V&A Waterfront, Kloof Street, and Long Street. However, it is always advisable to take basic precautions and keep valuables out of sight to avoid opportunistic crimes.\nIs Johannesburg safe for white tourists?\nJohannesburg, like any major city, has safety concerns. While the central city may not always be safe for tourists, traveling in a group and ensuring valuables are well-hidden can enhance personal safety.\nWhat food is Cape Town famous for?\nCape Town is renowned for its culinary scene and offers a variety of delicious dishes. Some South African favorites include the Great Gatsby sandwich, traditional Cape Malay cuisine, biltong (dried cured meat), peppermint crisp tart, and vetkoek (fried dough bread). The city",

    "text": "When checking in on the benevolence of God, what about things like cancer? It seems to me to be a stretch of the imagination that all forms of cancer are entirely natural. Except for the likelihood that they are natural consequences to our unnatural actions. By using the word ‘unnatural’ here I’m referring to things like the continued use of dangerous chemicals and substances that are known to cause cancer, as an example. We inflict most cancers upon society by our own actions, nearly all of them are preventable. There are also cancers which would occur via nature, even without our deliberate choice to include harmful substances in our food, medicines, products, or in the air we breathe. But those could be resolved as well with greater cooperation among us. So, even those cancers become an unnatural consequence of our societal divisions. Every single form of health concern would benefit from greater unity in society. I think God is waiting for us to figure that out. We frequently mistake the suffering we personally experience to be punishments against us. Which means when we cannot connect the dots on the suffering of a child to its own actions, we too quickly conclude that God either created that suffering, or did nothing to prevent it. But what if God understands entirely why that suffering has occurred and is choosing to allow us to clean up our own mess so that we learn from it rather than simply punishing us; which would make it so that we are unable to associate the suffering with our own actions? God would certainly know that we have to learn from our mistakes. Benevolence in this instance, would mean the withholding of interference, in order to allow that learning to take place. Punishing a dog five hours after it poops in the living room, and through methods it cannot connect to the behavior in the first place, will not benefit its training. If God wants us to learn, It would know this, for the same is true in people too. Are prayers then ineffective? I can’t believe that they are. I’d conclude that prayer is an important part of the action of connecting with the Divine during our trials, so that they are perhaps more comprehensible to us, or so that we can find comfort in our grief. They may even serve to energetically intervene in how the events unfold, so long as it doesn’t interfere in our growth but instead boosts it through the confirmation of our faith. This brings us to our philosophy on forgiveness—and the existence of Hell also, for that matter. How does a benevolent God administer forgiveness? This is interesting to me, because as I see it, all existing notions on the subject are deeply flawed. I think that true benevolence precludes the idea that God even needs to forgive us in the first place. Consider for a moment the practice of asking God’s forgiveness for something that we have been taught is an offense to It. Confession, contrition, and repentance are actions which, according to Catholics anyway, is the process for earning God’s forgiveness of mortal (serious) or venial (not so serious) sins. What might God’s position on that be? If we hold that God is all-knowing, meaning It knows our hearts and therefore knows the pain which precedes our harmful actions, is God understanding of even our most severe actions? The notion that God exists in a state of unforgiveness until we go through the theatre of asking for It to change Its view of us feels contradictory to the parts of scripture which describe God otherwise. Benevolence is not said to be conditional. It is portrayed as a universal sentiment of the Divine spanning all of creation. Benevolence supersedes even the notion of a perpetual Hell. Where is the benevolence in the idea of eternal punishment? The opposite must be true, that forgiveness is not for us to ask from God, but rather to ask God for help in forgiving ourselves and others. God’s benevolence, if real, must dictate that we are divinely pre-forgiven and that only our own lack of forgiveness stands in the way of the joy for which we were designed. If God knows our hearts, It knows why we do the things we do. It understands us in a way that we cannot. God encourages us to see ourselves with the same magnificence that is Its own view. The idea of God needing to go through the motions of forgiving us is simply a transference of our human shortcomings onto the Divine. Benevolence does not require God to pose for a time as an angry parent waiting for an apology. This is my case for a belief in a benevolent God. There are likely so many holes in my rationale that an army of trucks could drive through them. And of course absolutely none of this might be true in any way. Which leaves us with the possibility that perhaps those of us who think these things do so just to feel better about something that feels so out of our control. But I can live with that.

    "text": "Marixa Balli contó por qué dejó de seguir en Instagram a Marcelo Tinelli (Video: LAM, América) A poco días de su estreno, el Cantando (América) genera todo tipo de repercusiones en el mundo del espectáculo. Desde la lista de participantes hasta la conformación del jurado, los rumores sobre el regreso del ciclo comenzaron a circular en redes sociales. En ese sentido, después de muchas versiones, este jueves se conoció que Florencia Peña será la conductora del programa . En ese contexto, en LAM (América) analizaron los roles de las diferentes figuras. Sin embargo, la polémica apareció cuando Marixa Balli confesó que no estaba al tanto de los detalles ya que había dejado de seguir a Marcelo Tinelli en Instagram .\nTodo comenzó cuando el equipo debatía sobre el rol que tendría Milett Figueroa , pareja del conductor, como jurado en el Cantando. “Se ve que no viste la última historia de Marcelo”, comentó Yanina Latorre. Inmediatamente, Balli tomó la palabra y afirmó que efectivamente ya no seguía en Instagram a la figura de la televisión. Ante la reacción de sus compañeras, la bailarina detalló: “La verdad es que no lo sigo. Lo dejé de seguir hace dos meses . Y al día siguiente él me dejó de seguir a mí ”.\n“¿Por qué lo dejaste de seguir?”, quiso indagar Fernanda Iglesias . Si bien la panelista quería esquivar el tema, se vio obligada a responder ante la insistencia de las angelitas. “La verdad es que ya me pudrí. Me harté de todas las bol... de Marcelo. Pero me pudrí de todas las cosas. Y la verdad que sí. La cuestión es que yo lo dejo de seguir y al día siguiente me causó gracia porque él me dejó de seguir”, destacó.\nMarixa Balli contó por qué dejó de seguir en Instagram a Marcelo Tinelli Al relatar su decisión, sus compañeras le recriminaron cómo se había dado cuenta que el conductor la había dejado de seguir. “Voy a ser sincera, lo dejo de seguir y me hice una apuesta a mí misma. Le doy 24 horas. Y fue automático. ¿Quién miraba a quién? Miré si me seguía o no, y obvio . Dejé pasar 24 horas y miré de chusma y dije ‘a ver, ¿lo vio, se dio cuenta?’. Y obvio que sí, porque me dejó de seguir ”. En ese sentido, Pepe Ochoa comentí que Marixa había logrado llevar adelante su marca de ropa gracias al apoyo de Tinelli: “¿Cómo Xurama no sigue a Marcelo? Le debe todo”. Sin embargo, la bailarina se puso firme y contestó: “¿Quién le debe?. Con Xurama desde el año 2005 que la vengo remando”. A pesar de la respuesta, el panelista continuó: “Pero te la hizo famosa Marcelo en el Bailando . Para vos y para tu hermana”.\nFue entonces cuando Balli ahondó más en el tema y explicó un antiguo cruce que había tenido en el programa de Tinelli: “Sí, bueno. Yo quiero aclarar, fue un día que me minimizaron y empezaron a hablar de La Salada y que si alguien se compraría ropa ahí. Estaba Lizardo (Ponce) y Marcelo le hace un juego. ‘Y vos, Lizardo, ¿te comprarías ropa en la Salada?’ Dijeron ‘no, no’, siempre minimizando y discriminando, ahí dije ‘bueno, paremos un cacho. Ya está, chicos. Hay formas y formas’”.\nMarcelo Tinelli confirmó a Flor Peña como conductora del Cantando Luego, Marixa continuó detallando el detrás de escena del conflicto: “Empiezan a hacer ese juego, que la verdad que no quedó bien. No sé qué pasó en las redes o qué sucedió porque en un momento me enojo y les digo ‘miren chicos, con Xurama todo bien, con la joda todo bien, yo me engancho, me prendo en todo, pero ya cuando pasamos al terreno de la discriminación, no. Se los dije ahí mismo en el aire, en Showmatch ”.\nPara cerrar, Balli volvió a explicar por qué reaccionó de esa manera y cómo hizo Tinelli para resolver el tema al aire: “Marcelo, que es súper hábil, dio vuelta todo. Estuvimos 50 minutos hablando del tema, tanto que vino el Chato y me dijo ‘¿sabés lo caro que sale esto como prensa, como promo?’. Le dije ‘bueno, no fue mi culpa’. Yo tengo mucho humor, puedo joder y me cago de risa, pero cuando hablan peyorativamente obvio que me molesta”.",
