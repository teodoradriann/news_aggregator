    "text": "Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union (EU) has made several efforts to increase its collaborative defence output, but now the organisation has just laid down its longer-term goals and the funds to achieve them.\nOn 5 March, 2024, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and High Representative, Josep Borrell, presented the EU’s first ever Defence Industrial Strategy.\nTogether, they put forward a legislative proposal for a\nEuropean Defence Industry Programme (EDIP) and a framework of measures to ensure the timely availability and supply of defence products.\nThis Strategy outlines the challenges that the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) currently faces but also the opportunity to tap its full potential and set out a direction for the next decade.\nEDIP is a new legislative initiative that will bridge from short-term emergency measures, adopted in 2023 and ending in 2025, to a more structural and longer-term approach to achieve defence industrial readiness.\nNotably, EDIP will mobilise €1.5bn ($1.63bn) of the EU budget over the period 2025-2027, to continue enhancing the competitiveness of the EDTIB.\nThere will be three performance indicators that measure Member States’ progress toward industrial readiness:\n- Member States will procure at least 40% of defence equipment in a collaborative manner by 2030;\n- Ensure that, by 2030, the value of intra-EU defence trade represents at least 35% of the value of the EU defence market;\n- Make steady progress towards procuring at least 50% of their defence procurement budget within the EU by 2030 and 60% by 2035.\nProactive, not responsive\nUntil now, much like other countries, the EU has been pursuing a short-term strategy in reviving the EDTIB throughout 2023.\nIn July last year, the European Parliament and Council agreed to a regulation under the\nAct in Support of Ammunition Production, in which the Union allocated €500m ($545.4m) to support Europe’s constrained ammunition and missile suppliers.\nIn the same way, the EU set an ammunition production\ntarget of one million rounds, specifically to replenish Ukraine’s exhausted stocks.\nThese individual, one-off commitments demonstrate the Union’s responsive approach, whereas fundamentally the new Strategy will implement a more proactive approach to the current security climate.\nEU defence competitiveness\nThe EDTIB remains a global player in the defence market. There are a number of top-performing prime companies that are leaders in the global defence industry, including MBDA – the continent’s foremost missile manufacturer.\nThe company has restarted production of various enduring systems that were widely used, such as the\nEnforcer man-portable missile system, which is due to enter full-scale production for the Bundeswehr. In addition, MBDA Germany’s ramjet producer subsidiary, Bayern Chemie, rejoined Raytheon’s Patriot missile defence system supply chain after more than two decades. The Bavarian company produced more than 2,300 rocket motors for PAC-2 missiles from 1987 to 1996.\nIn a\nspeech at the European Parliament Plenary on 28 February, von der Leyen urged member states to increase collaboration in defence spending as the EU looks to become a more independent actor on the global stage.\nThe possible acceptance that EU member states could struggle to compete with the industrial capacity of the US, and its clear technological advantage, is perhaps indicated in von der Leyen’s call for public and private lenders to support the continent’s defence industry and, in particular, its small and medium enterprises.\nAdditional reporting from Richard Thomas.",

    "text": "TLDR - There is renewed optimism amongst Bitcoin bulls as its price soared to a 21-month high following the recent positive developments around the asset. - Investors have found NuggetRush, a new meme coin, to be the next big thing for profits this quarter. - NuggetRush’s presale will complete its fourth round in about 19 days, with a price uptick of 20% for the next round. Last year saw a series of benchmarks surpassed in Bitcoin’s (BTC) network and on-chain activities. On the cusp of the new year, BTC has already recorded a massive liquidation of Bitcoin shorts, a notable daily increase in transaction confirmations, and its DeFi coin price skyrocketed above $45,000. These developments, amongst others, emphasize that the crypto bulls are back up and active as 2024 commences. Drawing parallels to BTC’s uptrend, [NuggetRush (NUGX)](https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bit&utm_content=133) [ i](https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bit&utm_content=133)s a relatively new cryptocurrency initial coin offering (ICO) in the meme coin sector, turning heads this year’s first quarter. As NuggetRush intertwines blockchain gaming with real-time earnings, it appeals to newbies and pro-investors seeking a top ICO venture with tangible utility and profitability potential. This article will explain why NuggetRush is a coining token for gains this quarter. NuggetRush (NUGX) Brings A New Dimension Of Play-to-Earn (P2E) Gaming [NuggetRush](https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bit&utm_content=133) offers a platform where cryptocurrency investing, P2E gaming, earning, and social impact all interlink. It forms the foundation of a revolutionary blockchain game akin to real-world artisanal mining while actively making a worthwhile difference in the lives of artisanal miners in underdeveloped countries. Also, every digitally mined gold nugget in the game is linked to tangible rewards like gold and cash in real-time. NuggetRush features a no-tax and zero-fee model, ensuring that users can engage with the project without the burden of extra fees. Also, the platform provides an enticing array of giveaways to active participants worth $150,000 in total. All the rewarding avenues of NuggetRush boost user engagement and drive its rapid ascent on the decentralized cryptocurrency list, as it offers many benefits that exceed speculative trading. The ongoing presale has seen the sale of over 130 million NUGX tokens in four rounds, amassing over $1.5 million in funding. At the end of the presale, investors can claim up to 50% of the tokens in five claim rounds, according to their entry time. NuggetRush also provides another avenue for earning through its staking mechanism, where non-fungible token (NFT) holders can earn up to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY). NUGX currently sits at a DeFi coin price of $0.015 and has about 9.5 million tokens left before the price increases to $0.018 in the last round. The well-outlined roadmap and goals of the project are also propelling NuggetRush towards its proposed $100 million market cap milestone. This top ICO promises good gains and growth as an enticing pick to venture into in January 2024. Bitcoin (BTC) Clears The $45,000 Resistance Level. Bitcoin has cleared its previous resistance level and reached an intrayear high of $45,870, as shown in CoinGecko data. The big move pushed the world’s largest digital asset to its highest level since March 2022, and BTC is now just 34% down from its peak price of $69,000 in November 2021. The surge can be attributed to the spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) approval hype. Bitcoin investors are kickstarting the year well, as seen in the recent rise in transactional activities. The Bitcoin network recently eclipsed yet another record by verifying 731,351 daily transactions. Additionally, a massive liquidation of Bitcoin shorts, amounting to over $115 million, happened on January 1. BTC‘s ongoing strong performance could indicate a broader market upturn, as it is a bellwether for other digital assets. Conclusion There is an uptick in Bitcoin’s price action this new year as optimism around BTC ETF approval continues to gather momentum. On the other hand, the decentralized cryptocurrency list features a coining token, NuggetRush, that fosters an empowered gaming community and offers perks like tangible utility, no extra costs, and multiple earning opportunities. As evidenced by numbers, its presale has maintained a bullish trend, with participants bulk-buying the tokens for gains. Interested investors can purchase NUGX from the website now that it costs less this quarter.",

    "text": "SALEM — U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton met with leaders from North Shore and Lynn community health centers and Eliot Community Human Services on Wednesday at Salem Family Health to discuss the impact of federal funding cuts and immigration policies on low-income populations.\nMoulton, a Democrat representing Massachusetts’ 6th Congressional District, emphasized the urgency of the issue.\n“This doesn’t just affect the patients; it affects everyone in the community,” he said. “No matter where you are, everyone will feel the effects of Trump and Musk and what they are doing illegally to cut funds.”\nWhile Moulton labeled the actions as “illegal,” legal challenges to the funding cuts are ongoing, and no final ruling has been made on their constitutionality.\nMaggie Brennan, president and CEO of North Shore Community Health, said federal grants fund nearly a quarter of their payroll, making cuts a major threat to their operations.\n“Those are money losers,” Brennan said of school-based health centers. “They’re a community benefit that we really want to continue to maintain, but if we have to start making cuts…”\nBrenda Rodrigues, chief operating officer of Lynn Community Health Center, said these centers serve thousands of students.\n“At Lynn Community Health Center, we have 18 counselors serving around 3,700 students,” she said. “If we pull those resources out, our students will suffer. We’re preventing suicides, emergency room visits, and keeping hardworking families from missing work.”\nA proposed $2 surcharge on prescriptions in Massachusetts threatens the 340B drug pricing program, which helps health centers buy discounted medications.\n“That would totally erode the program,” Brennan said. “We’ve told the Executive Office of Health and Human Services this can’t happen. We’re hanging by a thread.”\nShe also warned that Medicaid cuts would destabilize the entire healthcare system.\n“Hospitals’ finances are also gonna take a hit,” she said. “If Medicaid is cut, places will go under. The system is knit together.”\nHealth leaders said immigration enforcement is scaring patients away from medical appointments.\n“It’s anxiety in the air that they’re breathing,” Brennan said. “We’ve had dental patients in serious pain not show up.”\nShe recalled a front desk worker calling a patient, only to hear: “Is this ICE calling me?”\nDr. Marion Winfrey, a longtime board member of North Shore Community Health, said the fear is keeping families from food pantries, medical visits, and mental health care.\n“This administration is setting up a lost generation,” Winfrey said. “Kids are losing access to behavioral health services, food, and essential care.”\nRyan Ribeiro-Rodriguez, chief operating officer of North Shore Community Health, said public service loan forgiveness is crucial for hiring clinicians and nurses.\n“If that goes away, we’re going to become less able to have staff here to serve,” he said.\nDr. Amer El-Haddad, chief medical officer at North Shore Community Health, warned that funding cuts could impact addiction treatment.\n“At North Shore, about 10% of our patients have some sort of addiction, whether alcohol or opioids,” El Haddad said. “Our program is robust, but budget cuts put it at risk.”\nHe added that many patients needing addiction care are uninsured, forcing health centers to cover the costs.\n“This is part of our ethos, our values — we’re going to do this. But at what cost?” he said. “If we had to make choices, what would we do? I don’t know.”\nMoulton said his colleagues would push back against the cuts, but he acknowledged the political reality.\n“Democrats are going to fight,” he said. “But I don’t want to be unrealistic and tell you everything’s going to be okay because I don’t think it is.”\nHe urged health leaders to focus on economic arguments and the impact on children, saying those points resonate more broadly.\n“They claim to be saving money, but these cuts will cost more in the long run,” Moulton said. “And if they’re willing to attack kids, we need to make sure people know that.”\nAs the meeting concluded, he reaffirmed his support.\n“We will continue to be strong advocates for all that you’re doing,” he said. “You can help us by giving us stories, data, and ammunition to fight more effectively.”\nHealth leaders said the future remains uncertain, but without action, the most vulnerable in the North Shore community will suffer the most.",

    "title": "Las reservas hoteleras para el puente no llegan al 80 % ante la previsión de lluvia",
    "text": "Secciones\nEl gozo en un pozo. Las excelentes expectativas que se habían fijado los empresarios hoteleros de la ciudad ante el puente del 1 de mayo se han visto rebajadas ante la previsión de lluvias para los próximos días, según confirma el responsable de los hoteles en la Asociación de Hostelería de Salamanca, Silverio Vicente, quien califica de «mala suerte» esta situación que ya se produjo en las pasadas vacaciones de Semana Santa, donde las cancelaciones de última hora dejaron a los hoteles muy por debajo de la ocupación esperada. Y es que, según anuncia Vicente, las reservas hasta el miércoles se situaban entre el 70 % y el 80 %, cuando lo normal es que se superase el 90 % de ocupación.\nA pesar de estos datos, el representante de los hoteles se muestra optimista y confiado en poder recuperar ocupación y llegar a los índices esperados. «Es cierto que las previsiones de lluvia han retraído las reservas, pero confiemos en que a última hora la gente se anime y venga a Salamanca», subraya Silverio Vicente, consciente de que el puente del 1 de mayo era una de las fechas marcadas en rojo en el calendario. «La coincidencia de fechas era inmejorable, no solo para los turistas de Madrid que tienen dos festivos y que suelen ser los principales viajeros en estos días, sino para los del resto de España», apostilla.\nDe momento, reina un cierto optimismo, ya que, contrariamente a lo que ocurrió en Semana Santa, hasta el miércoles no se estaban produciendo cancelaciones. «Pero nunca se sabe, pues tienen la posibilidad de hacerlo hasta el último momento. Esperemos que esto no ocurra», anota Vicente, confiado en que «estemos ante un buen puente, en el que no haya cancelaciones y aumenten las reservas de última hora».\nY esta misma confianza es la que muestra el representante de los hoteles salmantinos de cara al día de San Isidro (15 de mayo), que en Madrid es festivo y al caer en jueves también da pie a un nuevo puente. «Ya estamos notando algunas reservas; las expectativas para dicho puente también son buenas, aunque no tan altas como este del 1 de mayo, ya que solo será puente en Madrid».\nEsta funcionalidad es exclusiva para registrados.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "text": "Celebrating his third victory as a trainer in the G3 Bauhinia Sprint Trophy Handicap (1000m), Tony Cruz deflected credit for the success to jockey Harry Bentley after the Englishman crowned his comeback to riding with an upset win on outsider Whizz Kid at Sha Tin on Sunday.\nStarting at 24/1, Whizz Kid (115lb) upstaged Invincible Sage (115lb) and Packing Treadmill (117lb) to provide Bentley with his first Group race triumph in Hong Kong less than a week after the lightweight rider returned to competition after serving a two-month suspension for improper conduct.\nCruz, who previously won the HK$4.2 million feature with champion sprinter Silent Witness in 2004 and 2005, praised Bentley’s display after the Briton allowed Whizz Kid to stride forward and sit outside Victor The Winner before taking a lead he would never surrender, clocking 56.86s – more than a second outside of standard time.\n“He’s been a great horse for the stable, but I must give the credit to Harry Bentley. He rode a perfect race. I told him to jump and go with the flow, and he did exactly that,” Cruz said after replacing blinkers with a visor on the five-year-old gelding.\n“I’ve been trying everything on him and that’s the only thing that works. It worked today. He’s a healthy horse and has never been a headache. He’s honest and he’s easy to train.\n“I thought Happy Valley was his track, but with the programme, I had no option but to go for this race. Otherwise, there's nowhere else to go. I gambled on it, tried something different and it turned out good.”\nCruz said he would “give Bentley more opportunities in my stable. He's very natural, he's got good hands and like I said to him today to ‘go with the flow’, he did exactly that. I reckon we haven't seen the best of him yet in Hong Kong.\n“This horse is as honest as you can ever get, but it's how the jockey rides him that's most important,” Cruz said.\nBentley was elated post-race after returning last week to race riding, but having to wait until today’s feature to score – before capping his afternoon by sealing a double atop Blue Marlin for Douglas Whyte in the Class 3 Lai King Handicap (1400m).\n“I’m delighted, first day back here at Sha Tin, to get a double,” Bentley said. “Firstly, getting my first Group win here in Hong Kong was great and great to partner up with Blue Marlin again – he’s been a great horse for me.\n“This is the fourth time I’ve won on him, third time this season. He’s been plagued by a few bad draws but I’ve been the fortunate person to step in when he comes back to a nice draw.\n“He’s a tough horse who has run only a few days ago (1 January) – fair play to the trainer and from a personal point of view it’s great to be back.”",

    "text": "El Papa: Navidad, la inaudita ternura de Dios que salva el mundo encarnándose\nVatican News\nAl acercarnos al final del año, y pocos días después de haber celebrado la Navidad, resuenan las palabras que el Papa Francisco pronunció en su\nhomilía, en la Santa Misa de Nochebuena que presidió en la Basílica de San Pedro. Este viernes, 29 de diciembre, el Santo Padre nos recuerda en un post publicado en su cuenta de X que, la Navidad no es una mezcla de afectos melosos y de consuelos mundanos, sino la inaudita ternura de Dios que salva el mundo encarnándose.\nEl riesgo de una Navidad con una idea pagana de Dios\nEn esa noche Santa, el Pontífice invitaba a reflexionar sobre la trama humana del censo que atraviesa la historia, en la cual el beneficio del mundo se confronta con la encarnación de Jesús. Y advertía del riesgo de vivir la Navidad con una idea pagana de Dios, con esa falsa idea de un dios útil solo para resolvernos los problemas y quitarnos los males.\n“Él, en cambio, no usa la varita mágica, no es el dios comercial del ‘todo y ahora mismo’; no nos salva pulsando un botón, sino que Él se acerca para cambiar la realidad desde dentro”.\nVolver nuestra mirada al Dios vivo y verdadero\nY ante esta idea mundana de un dios alejado y controlador, el Santo Padre invitaba a volver nuestra mirada al Dios vivo y verdadero, al que esta más allá de todo calculo humano; a él, que borra el pecado cargándolo sobre si, a él que no elimina los problemas, sino que les da una esperanza más grande, a él que nos salva.\n“Miremos al Niño, miremos su cuna, contemplemos el pesebre, que los ángeles llaman la «señal». Es, en efecto, el signo que revela el rostro de Dios, que es compasión y misericordia, omnipotente siempre y sólo en el amor. Se hace cercano, tierno y compasivo, este es el modo de ser de Dios: cercanía, compasión, ternura”.\nÉl, que se hizo carne, espera tu corazón abierto y confiado\nEste es el asombro de la Navidad, subraya el Papa, que Dios se hizo carne, y en la fragilidad de nuestra carne ha cambiado la historia. Por ello, ante nuestras fragilidades, caídas, problemas, y pecados no debemos sentirnos fracasados sino dejar la iniciativa a Jesús, que nos dice: “Por ti me hice carne, por ti me hice como tú”.\n“Como los pastores, que dejaron sus rebaños, deja el recinto de tus melancolías y abraza la ternura del Dios Niño. Y hazlo sin máscaras, sin corazas, encomiéndale a Él tus afanes y Él te sostendrá. Él, que se hizo carne, no espera de ti tus resultados exitosos, sino tu corazón abierto y confiado”.\nPor ello, antes de terminar el año el Papa Francisco nos recuerda que esa noche el amor cambia la historia y pide al Señor que creamos en el poder de su amor, tan distinto del poder del mundo.",

    "text": "Garlic image\nPerspective from Faith Seke PhD, Agronomy and Crop Science (ongoing), Master’s degree, Food Science and Technology · 1 years of experience · South Africa Possible Side Effects\nIndividuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease must consult healthcare professionals as consuming garlic might trigger heartburn. Individuals taking blood thinners should seek assistance when considering increasing garlic intake because it might interact with the medication. Quantity Recommendation\n1-2 cloves of garlic everyday can help in the well functioning of the body, when taking garlic in supplement form it is recommended that one takes about 3600 mg of the extract a day. → Garlic: How much should you eat? Experts weigh in.\n→ See benefits of Garlic from this expert\nPerspective from Kiran Dhaliwal Master’s Degree Nutrition and Dietetics · 3 years of experience · Australia Possible Side Effects\nGarlic is high in fructans and may cause individuals to experience indigestion, diarrhoea and intestinal gas especially if they are fructan intolerant. As garlic has antithrombotic properties, it may prevent blood clots from forming. This may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if taking blood thinner or about to undergo a medical procedure. When taking garlic avoid taking fish oil or vitamin E. Also avoid using other supplements with garlic as this may affect blood clotting. People that have gastroesophageal reflux may want to decrease their garlic intake as garlic may decrease the lower esophageal sphincter tone which is the muscle that prevents acid from entering. This is very dependent on the individual, as it may not cause symptoms in some. Quantity Recommendation\nGarlic poses very minimal safety issues and having allergies are quite rare. If you are using it for cholesterol benefits, please check your levels after three months. The recommended amount of garlic daily ranges from half to one whole clove per day. Cooking the garlic before eating can help with acid reflux, garlic breath and digestive issues. → Garlic: How much should you eat?
