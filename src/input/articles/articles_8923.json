    "text": "Tunisian imam expelled by France says to appeal decision A Tunisian imam expelled from France for alleged hate speech said on Friday he would take legal action in a bid to overturn the decision. Mahjoub Mahjoubi, from the town of Bagnols-sur-Ceze in the south of France, denounced his removal as \"arbitrary\". The 52-year-old was arrested and then deported to Tunisia on Thursday, where he arrived shortly before midnight aboard a flight from Paris. Mahjoubi had been in France since the 1980s and is married with five children. All of his children are French citizens, but he is not and had his residency permit cancelled on Sunday by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. The official order for Mahjoubi's expulsion, seen by AFP, said that in sermons in February he had given a \"retrograde, intolerant and violent\" image of Islam that would encourage behaviour against French values, discrimination against women, \"tensions with the Jewish community\" and \"jihadist radicalisation\". The imam also referred to \"the Jewish people as the enemy\", according to the order, which said Mahjoubi called for \"the destruction of Western society\". The imam was also accused of sharing a video in which he described the \"tricolour\" - without specifying if he meant the French flag - as \"satanic\" and of \"no value with Allah\". Mahjoubi defending himself, saying it had been a \"slip of the tongue\" and that he was referring to rivalries between football supporters of different Maghrebi nations during the recent African Cup of Nations. \"I will fight to return to France where I have lived for 40 years,\" the imam told AFP in his in-laws' house in Sulayman, 30 kilometres (19 miles) east of Tunis. Mahjoubi, who runs a construction company, said his family, including his youngest child who is in hospital for cancer treatment, depended entirely on him. \"My lawyer is going to take legal action in France if the court does not grant me justice, I will appeal, and then I will appeal to the European Court\" of Human Rights, he added. \"I did not insult the Jewish community, nor the flag of France,\" he said. On Thursday, Darmanin posted on social media that the expulsion was a \"demonstration\" that a recently approved immigration law \"makes France stronger\". The law toughening migration conditions was seen as part of the government's response to the rise of the far-right in French opinion polls. \"Firmness is the rule,\" said Darmanin, who slammed what he called a \"radical imam who made unacceptable comments\". Mahjoubi denounced the expulsion as being based on \"an arbitrary decision\", and said Darmanin was using his case to \"create a buzz around the immigration law\".",

    "title": "Newly discovered snake species provides insight into reptile social behaviour and development | Folio",
    "text": "A newly discovered snake species, Hibernophis breithaupti, provides rare insight into the social behaviour of snakes and fills some gaps in our knowledge of the evolution of boas, or boidae. The quartet of fossilized snakes discovered in western Wyoming dates back 38 million years. The snake specimens were preserved in a cluster within a hibernaculum, a space where animals shelter together during colder months. The position in which the specimens were found “represents social behaviour in snakes, which is something that we don’t often see,” [Michael Caldwell](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/mikec) explains. According to Caldwell, a professor in the [Faculty of Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/science/index.html), this is the first clear evidence of reptilian social behaviour in the fossil record. This behaviour also sets this new species apart from other reptiles. Though many mammals hibernate during the winter, only one species of snake is known to follow suit: the garter snake. “This is really unusual for reptiles. Of the almost 15,000 different kinds of reptile species alive today, none of them hibernate in the way that garter snakes do.” The discovery of four ancient snakes in a cluster suggests they may have behaved like modern garter snakes, grouping together for protection during colder months. (Photo: Greg Schechter via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0) In addition to being an indication of snakes’ social behaviour, the practice of gathering in a hibernaculum is an adaptation that allows garter snakes to survive in colder climates. “They can’t regulate their body temperature so they need to find a way to conserve as much heat as they can through the winter and they do this by forming these big masses,” says Caldwell. While this particular hibernaculum featured just four fossilized snakes, modern [garter snakes gather in the hundreds or even thousands](https://royalalbertamuseum.ca/blog/garter-snakes#:~:text=Much%20like%20other%20animals%20here,%2C%20or%20man%2Dmade%20structures.). Their adaptation is so well known, Caldwell explains, that sometimes clever solo snakes from other species, such as rattlesnakes, will hide amongst the garter snakes, benefiting from the group’s protection. The ancient snake specimens were also articulated, meaning they were found in one piece with the bones still in the proper order, which is extremely uncommon. “There are probably, in the world’s museum collections, nearly a million disarticulated snake vertebrae. They are easy to find. But finding the whole snake? That’s rare.” The articulated specimens give us a better understanding of the evolution of boidae, a family of snakes with more than 50 species, including burrowing boas like Hibernophis breithaupti. One of the snakes within the quartet is approximately twice the size of the others, allowing the researchers to see the same species of snake at different stages of development. The discovery of the new snake species has yielded insights into the evolution of modern snakes like the Amazon tree boa (Ieft) and scrub python (right). (Photos: Michael Lee, Flinders University/South Australian Museum) “We learn quite a bit more about boidae evolution in the broad sense,” says Caldwell. “It seems that they probably started out as relatively small-bodied snakes, which is interesting.” The skulls are a key area to gauge growth and development. Just as the proportions of head to body change dramatically in humans from infancy to adulthood, a snake’s skull and head-to-body proportions change over its lifespan. Since snake skulls are very thin and delicate, though, they’re typically not preserved well enough to track that progression. These new specimens also indicate how a snake’s vertebrae differ in shape and size based on where on the body they are located. Even a small snake has anywhere from 200 to 400 vertebrae, which commonly get separated and scattered in different areas before fossilization occurs. The ability to see the entire spine is a valuable reference point. Caldwell says it raises the question of whether bones previously ascribed to new species were indeed new. Perhaps particular vertebrae clusters just gave that impression, but actually came from different parts of the fossilized spines of the same species. These rare articulated snake specimens have remained so remarkably well preserved for tens of millions of years because of their location. As Caldwell explains, 38 million years ago, when these particular Hibernophis breithaupti snakes were alive, the Southern Basin and Range Volcanic System was incredibly active and emitting huge quantities of volcanic ash. The ash settled and helped preserve the bodies of the creatures, which were found in a matrix of “fine, sandy mudstone” typical of the White River Formation, according to the paper the researchers published about the fossil find. The researchers speculate that the animals fell victim to a “small flood episode.” “They were preserved in a very unusual circumstance, geologically speaking,” says Caldwell. “Fossilization is a rough process. You need exactly the right conditions to preserve something.” [The study](https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae073/7696309?redirectedFrom=fulltext) was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.",

    "text": "Kevin Stevick is the President and CEO of SteelCraft, a Materials Manufacturing company based in Hartford, WI.\nThe catchphrase for the past year seems to have been, “AI is coming for your job,” but now we are seeing that is not exactly the case. In the world of industrial manufacturing, which has essentially been automating manual labor for decades, new advancements in technology constantly make and reshape the labor landscape, creating new jobs and skills while making old ones obsolete.\nAs the Fordian assembly line gave way to the first generation of car-making robots, advancements in automation made room for specialist careers. With AI, what manufacturing is undergoing right now is a rise of specialists in tandem with an elimination of tedious tasks.\nTo that end, even NASCAR has reduced the number of lugnuts on tires down to a single bolt. From my perspective, this possibly signals the beginning of the end of pit crews tasked with swapping out wheels, as precision robots will be able to perform that task much more quickly and efficiently. Does that mean humans will soon become obsolete in the world of manufacturing? Far from it.\nMany manufacturers now realize that the key to successful automation is to not automate for the sake of automation. Automation can help eliminate dangerous and repetitive tasks, so true specialists can focus on crafting high-quality products for clients in the market for something that first meets their specific needs.\nMORE FOR YOU The Real Secret To Pass Your Final Round Interviews Three Supermoons, Two Comets And The ‘Great American Eclipse:’ The Sky In 2024 Explaining Nikki Haley’s No Mention Of Slavery Civil War Response Right now, I'm witnessing a trend where we, employers, are seeking to strike the right balance between skilled craftsmanship and automation. Manufacturers are leveraging this technology to make their skilled labor more efficient or effective while eliminating obsolete tasks.\nThe Enhanced Workforce This is a trend I'm experiencing firsthand. My company's latest capital investment was a state-of-the-art fiber laser, which has doubled our materials-cutting power. Additionally, this equipment has “lights out capability,” which allows it to run autonomously for long periods.\nThis advancement does not replace our skilled laser operators but encourages them to get reskilled so they can complete more advanced tasks that adhere to the unique requests of each client on a case-by-case basis. As automation eliminates low-skilled work, our laser operations team has pivoted to become a technical resource designed to help troubleshoot, program and ensure the smooth operation of the laser machinery to fulfill requests for new and unique products.\nThis represents the most prominent trends in manufacturing in recent years: using autonomous robots that can run for days without an operator to complete rote, repetitive tasks so employees on the shop floor can focus on being creative and developing their skills . Years ago, tasks like machining took up a considerable chunk of time for some of the most talented workers. Now, most of these tasks can even be completed without supervision when most employees are asleep.\nFrom my view, this can lead to a better work-life balance, as the formerly “mission critical” task of manufacturing the same complicated component by hand over and over again can now be relegated to automation; this frees up time for workers to take a vacation or cover shifts that are difficult to fill.\nThe workforce is changing, and I find that the ability to fill jobs on a 24/7 basis is decreasing while demand for products from manufacturers continues to climb. I believe the gap can be filled by equipment that can run “lights out” for a period of time and be produced consistently with limited skilled technician interaction.\nMy team is planning to use similar autonomous-based equipment in our tube cutting and brake press areas. The current operators’ assignments might change slightly, but the ability for us to continue to operate on shifts that are difficult to fill will significantly increase our capacity.\nCollaboration Plus Ideation Equals Automation In the past, when a client asked for a specific custom job, it might’ve cost them more out of pocket than the specialized labor. Now that the basics can be accomplished by computerized tech, manufacturing specialists have more time to collaborate and brainstorm ways to offer the most effective solution to a client request at the highest quality and lowest cost.\nIn essence, when skilled workers have more free time to be “skilled” and have to spend less time on jobs that feel monotonous, manufacturers gain the competitive edge of a shop floor that combines hundreds of years of practical experience to solve one problem, rather than spend hundreds of hours on jobs that can be automated.\nFor example, we have a series of robotic weld cells that frees up time for skilled welders to break down complicated problems. The robotic arms of the weld cells move around a fixture and are programmed to weld at certain spots throughout the fixture. It’s the robotic weld technician who provides the skills and expertise to ensure the robot is programmed properly for the part being manufactured and can troubleshoot the robot as needed.\nManual welding expertise will continue to be necessary, but robotic welding has brought undeniable opportunities to the field to complement what was once only possible through manual labor. Welders who learn how to use a robotic weld cell can develop more complicated skills for bespoke jobs that robots of the future can be programmed to do while ensuring that tasks that do not require much creativity can be delegated to a machine to free up time for human collaboration and problem-solving .\nIt’s an exciting time for the manufacturing sector and the skilled workers whose hard work has driven the industry forward since its inception. Leaders attempting to jump into AI-powered manufacturing with both feet should start by consulting the skilled workers on the shop floor as well as the talented professionals in the back office. Finding out which tasks are the most time-consuming, tedious or manually repetitive is a crucial step. Rote tasks burn out people much faster than they do machines. Creating upskilling and cross-training incentives for them is the ultimate way to keep employees motivated and leverage their invaluable skills in the age of automation.",

[➡️ Únete al canal de El Sol de Puebla en WhatsApp para no perderte la información más importante](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaB3w4UI7BeKmuTR0143) Se trata de un dato preliminar que brindó la propia dependencia municipal al integrante del Cabildo de Puebla, y corresponde a temas de infraestructura, específicamente de algunas obras concluidas, y otras que están en proceso. Hasta el momento, no se tiene el listado exacto de las involucradas. Con anterioridad, el presidente municipal de Puebla, José Chedraui Budib, expuso que el hoyo financiero está entre los 480 y 680 millones de pesos, aunque la cifra puede ser mayor. Leobardo Rodríguez reiteró que el déficit dificultará el actuar de la dependencia en el arranque de la administración municipal, al igual que en el resto de las secretarías que integran el ayuntamiento capitalino, aunque, la Secretaría de Movilidad e Infraestructura sí podrá realizar algunas intervenciones con dinero que provendrá de aportaciones federales, y recaudación propia. “Evidentemente, lo ideal hubiera sido que al llegar la nueva administración se hubiera podido disponer de todos los recursos, qué es lo que hemos estado viniendo diciendo (…) es dinero que tuvo que invertir”, comentó el morenista. El presidente de la Comisión de Infraestructura, Movilidad y Servicios Públicos, expuso que, los primeros días de noviembre se podrá conocer el monto total del déficit financiero que dejó la administración del panista Adán Domínguez Sánchez, con la presentación de los estados financieros.
