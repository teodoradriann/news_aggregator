    "text": "Navi Mumbai To Face 18-Hour Water Cut On July 18 For Pipeline Repair\nAffected areas under NMMC jurisdiction include Airoli, Belapur, Nerul, Koparkhairane, Turbhe, Sanpada, Ghansoli and Vashi.\nThe Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has announced an 18-hour water supply disruption in Navi Mumbai starting Friday, July 18. This disruption is necessary to carry out essential repair and connection work on the Morbe main water pipeline. As per the NMMC’s announcement, the work is scheduled to commence from 10 AM on Friday, July 18, to 4 AM on Saturday, July 19.\nThe work involves linking a newly laid pipeline to the existing 1700 mm diameter Morbe pipeline, which supplies drinking water to large parts of Navi Mumbai. The affected stretch runs along Palm Beach Road in Nerul Sector 46, near Akshar Building.\nRecommended Stories\nThis stretch has experienced multiple leakages in recent months, leading to water loss and disruptions. To address the issue, the NMMC laid a new pipeline alongside the existing one. Now, they have decided to connect the two.\nAs a result, the water supply will impact several key areas in Navi Mumbai. Affected areas under NMMC jurisdiction include Airoli, Belapur, Nerul, Koparkhairane, Turbhe, Sanpada, Ghansoli and Vashi. Localities that have direct tap connections to the main pipeline will also face a water supply suspension. In addition to this, CIDCO-administered areas such as Kharghar and Kamothe will also face disruption.\nDuring the shutdown, there will be no water service on Friday evening, July 18, or Saturday morning, July 19. The water supply is expected to be restored by Saturday evening, but it will be at low pressure.\nThe NMMC has urged all households in the impacted districts to store sufficient water in advance and use it sparingly during the disruption. NMMC officials emphasised that this connection work is critical for preventing future leaks and providing a more stable water delivery system for the city in the long run.\n“We urge citizens to bear with the temporary inconvenience and support the civic body in completing this critical work on schedule and without delays and use water mindfully,\" an NMMC officer was quoted as saying by the Free Press Journal.\nThe officials further stressed that the scheduled work aligns with broader efforts to create gender-inclusive, sustainable and community-sensitive urban services.\nAbout the Author\nBuzz Staff\n- Location :\n- First Published:\nTerms of Useand\nPrivacy Policy.",

    "title": "Sydney recovering from coldest, windiest spell in 13 years",
    "text": "Sydney just shivered through one of the windiest and coldest 5-day streaks in more than a decade, as freezing southerly winds lashed the NSW coast for days. The cold and ferocious winds were directed over the NSW coast by a slow-moving Tasman Low, which was held in place by a stubborn high pressure system over southern Australia. The Tasman Low rapidly deepened on Sunday, July 28 and continued to impact the NSW coast until Thursday, August 1. The image below shows the low in the Tasman directing a brisk southerly airstream over the NSW coast on Wednesday, with frequent cloud and showers moving north onto the coast. Image: Himawari-9 satellite image at 8am AEST on Wednesday, July 3 During the five days to midnight August 1, Sydney Observatory Hill recorded five consecutive days no warmer than 16.5 °C, with gusts peaking higher than 45 km/h each day. This is the coldest, windiest spell Sydney has seen in 13 years. Some notable observations during this period are: - Sydney’s ‘feels like’ temperature was –0.3°C at 9:50am on Sunday, July 28. - Sydney’s daytime temperature reached only 15°C on Sunday, July 28. - The overnight temperature dropped to 6.9°C early Tuesday morning, July 30. - Sydney’s mean wind speed peaked at 53.7 km/h and gusted up to 77.8 km/h on Sunday, July 28. - The prolonged period of southerly winds whipped up large and powerful surf, with Sydney’s waves peaking at 5 metres with a period of 14.9 seconds. The low has now moved away from Australia. As of Friday morning, the low was located near New Zealand’s North Island. As a result, conditions are now easing over NSW. While winds will be weaker on Friday, it will still feel cold, with temperatures in the city feeling no warmer than 12-13°C this afternoon. On the weekend the city will warm up further to 19 °C, with mostly sunny skies and light winds.

Son ellos mismos, los que se han cerrado en banda, compartiendo, entre ellos, su colección de conspiranoias...sin llegar a dudar de las mismas.\nLo peor de todo, es que han tratado de crear una ciencia paralela, desoyendo todo criterio científico, y tratando de auto-justificarse, en su infinita estupidez...ni sospechaba que el género humano fuese capaz de llegar a semejante nivel de retraso...\n[#67](c67#c-67) ¿Que países?, porque justamente países tercermundistas fueron los menos afectados, por la escasa movilidad de la población.\nHay muchas casuísticas a tener en cuenta, así que ¿Que países?\n[#95](c95#c-95) no me equivoco. Evidentemente si dejas una epidemia libre termianaras generando inmunidad natural. Esa inmunidad natural se gana con muchos más muertos de como lo conseguimos con la vacuna.\nTodo el mundo muere, y sin embargo entendemos que la quimioterapia cura el cáncer, los antibióticos curan las infecciones y la sepsis.\nTu razonamiento se basa en premisas básicas y superficiales\n[#121](c121#c-121) https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/how-they-work.html ahi tienes unas cuantas fuentes y estudios, te valen esos? O solo lo que dice un señor random?\n[#119](c119#c-119) me da mucha pena la gente carente de educación como tú, pero no tengo por qué aguantarla.\nTe vas al ignore con un reporte por insultos directos.\n[#75](c75#c-75) súper fiables los papers, sí. Se nota que no trabajas en la Universidad ni sabes cómo va el rollo de los papers.\nPues sigue en tu mundo.\n[#101](c101#c-101) más fiables que tu opinión personal basada en tus prejuicios\nSi, he pasado por la universidad y también sé que algún que otro paper puede no ser fiable, pero cuando juntas bastantes, la probabilidad de que todos sean poco rigurosos se reduce a cero. Y más en una materia como esta, que tuvo atención prioritaria por parte de todo el mundo en todo el mundo\nTambién tengo amigos médicos que han estado en primera línea y algo pueden decir acerca de si funcionan o no.\n[#140](c140#c-140) No es negacionismo de nada, abusas de la palabra que te enseñaron en la pandemia.\nLa nueva normalidad 😁\n[#141](c141#c-141) Es negacionismo de negar la ciencia.\nMira a ver si encuentras el muro de hielo del fin del mundo...\n[#100](c100#c-100) Que el cambio climático es antropogénico es ciencia. Etnocentrismo es otra cosa bastante distinta.\nY lo de \"experimento COVID\"... No sé a qué experimento te referirás, pero suena conspiranoico total...\n[#138](c138#c-138) Lo que es anticiencia es anular el debate. La única disciplina que afirma eso es la Climatología, que tiene registros de hace 100, como mucho 200 años. Una disciplina que tiene 70 años, subvencionada por los intereses macroeconómicos y políticos.\nAl menos trata de reflexionar sobre esto.\n[#139](c139#c-139) Del clima hay muchos más datos que esos 100 años que dices, obtenidos de diversas fuentes.\nLo que ha estado subvencionado por los intereses macroeconómicos y políticos, en concreto por las petroleras (ExxonMobil en concreto se gastó millones de dólares en eso), es la anti-ciencia del negacionismo.\nNo voy a perder el tiempo en reflexionar sobre el negacionismo, de igual forma que no pierdo el tiempo en reflexionar sobre el terraplanismo.\n[#103](c103#c-103) Los científicos de verdad tenéis la obligación de investigar diferentes hipótesis. Vosotros no lo hacéis. Sois crédulos. Un poco más de espíritu crítico, por favor.\n[#132](c132#c-132) Supongo que sabes que el pensamiento crítico es uno de los pilares de la ciencia. Pues te pongo la definición, para que me digas qué piensas:\nEl pensamiento crítico es el proceso de dudar de las afirmaciones que en la vida cotidiana suelen aceptarse como verdaderas.\nWikipedia\nPor favor, un poco de pensamiento crítico, que os las meten dobladas.\n[#50](c50#c-50) pues la vacuna estaba bastante mas probada que muchas otras, asi que permita que dude que no renuncia al conocimiento.",

Gypsy, who used a [wheelchair before it was discovered she could walk](/story/news/crime/2015/06/16/daughter-boyfriend-charged-murder-dee-dee-blancharde/28803189/), said she was desperate to escape her mother's abuse and sought help from her online boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn.
