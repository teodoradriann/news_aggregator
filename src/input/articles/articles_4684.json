    "title": "FORSETH: At Christmas, a Christian spiritual viewpoint about war",
    "text": "This Christmas season may not have much joy or optimism for some. There seems to be war everywhere. (Watch the video from which the picture is taken, here.) But our angst and internal turmoil over present wars, is a spiritual issue. Let us consider the big picture.God created the universe and then gradually began creating Earth as a special place for his ultimate creation, the human race. Humanity was made to have some God-like qualities in His image, of free choice and morality, created right in front of God’s adversary. The fallen Lucifer has always been against God’s beauty and His creation, especially living souls. After the sinful choice made by humanity through disobedience, there came human awareness of good and evil — blessing and calamity. Then God’s eventual plan of restoration was foretold in Genesis 3:15. “Her Seed; He shall fatally bruise your head and you shall only bruise His heel.” This was the Christmas announcement, the prophecy about the Messiah Jesus, who through His birth, death and resurrection would ultimately defeat Satan, the power behind the serpent, with a death blow. Isaiah 9:6 “For to us a Child shall be born, to us a Son shall be given; And the government shall be upon His shoulder, And His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”The selection of Jews as God’s reconnection pathway with His human creation was an affront to Lucifer. Consequently, the eternal spiritual battle and wars of retaliation arose from evil to smear and destroy the living souls of God’s creation, especially the Jews. The story of the power of darkness and negativity, warring against the God of light, optimism and grace, has existed from the very beginning as described in the Tora. Along the way, Lucifer was against the eternal plan of redemption of the human race that his evil had temporarily wounded, by trying to kill Christ the Redeemer. King Herod’s murder of children was one failed attempt. The resurrection of Jesus was evil’s final spiritual defeat. Consequently, the spiritual war was then to deceive as many as possible to keep them away from joining God’s family through Christ, by using imposters. Lucifer has used many agent usurpers to keep souls spiritually blind and away from God, sometimes appearing as fake pretenders. False religions were invented by Lucifer using willing human agents, to prevent souls from re-joining God’s family. The spiritual war has been played out down through the centuries. The murderous evil of Islamic Hamas is just the latest. But persecution against God’s children is also being significantly perpetrated right now in India, China, Russia, as well as anywhere that Islam has political control. Even in regions where God's own has some dominance — Canada being an example — evil is perpetuated by false agents to divide and divert away from the redemption of truth. For, although Canada has seen dark Christmas days in the past — such as during the two world wars of the last century — Canada is now experiencing something different — an internal cultural war. Observe, for example, the complaints about the discriminatory meaning of Christmas and the varied and subtle ways that the Christ of Christmas will be maligned, diverted and subverted. The evil walking about in society is especially noticeable since the invention of social media.A basic understanding comes when one retrospectively appreciates at a deeper level, that war, and especially the battle against Hitler and the USSR was a spiritual one. One can have moral clarity. Much of what happens has a spiritual force behind it, for both good and evil. This is the Christian understanding of our existence. It was the spiritual power of moral choice given at creation. If one does not support God’s long-term direction for humankind, as well as personally and privately participate in God’s redemption plan through Christ, then one has already assigned and defined oneself as spiritually dwelling in the enemy camp. Major battles and wars have at their core the motivations of evil against good. Every person makes their choice on which side they are living, and in which camp they choose to dwell. At the end of our life on earth, we will be evaluated and rewarded according to how well we handled what God entrusted within us. The key is to choose to live the full meaning of Christmas which is “Immanuel God with us” Isaiah 7:14.Ephesians 6:12: For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (KJV)As the Bible says, \"We’re not waging war against enemies of flesh and blood alone.\"\"No, this fight is against tyrants, against authorities, against supernatural powers and demon princes that slither in the darkness of this world and against wicked spiritual armies that lurk about in heavenly places.\"\"For we are not wrestling with flesh and blood, contending only with physical opponents, but against the despotisms, against the powers, against the master spirits who are the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly supernatural sphere.\"",

    "text": "Opinion\nNightmare Hits Family-Owned Business, But Owners Praise God and Stand Firm in Their Faith\nOn Sunday night, a fire caused significant damage to the Helberg Barbeque in Speegleville, Texas — a suburb of Waco.\nWhile the unexpected devastation and indefinite closure of a business would leave some proprietors wallowing in self-pity, the Helbergs responded by praising God and defying the evil one who tempts them to despair.\n“The enemy is going to have to work a lot harder than this to shake our faith,” the Helbergs wrote Monday as part of a lengthy Facebook post.\nIndeed, the Helbergs have made no secret of their dependence on\nGod.\nIn an interview with KWTX-TV in Waco — posted to YouTube on Tuesday — restaurant\nco-founder Phillip Helberg acknowledged that faith sustains his family.\nStop the censors, sign up to get today's top stories delivered right to your inbox\n“It’s the prayer and the comfort from our God that’s getting us through this right now,” he said.\nHelberg also asked KWTX viewers for spiritual assistance.\n“Pray for us,” he said while smiling. “I know we have a lot of — we’ve got a lot of prayer warriors in our corner.”\nBefore the devastating fire, the Helberg Barbeque\nwebsite used a Bible verse to proclaim joy at the coming Christmas season.\n“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace,” the restaurant’s website proclaimed Isaiah 9:6.\nThe family took that same approach when announcing news of the fire on Facebook.\n“Now, our interpretation and perspective is this: we are so thankful that nobody was present or was hurt. We can’t fathom the idea that we could have lost one of our team members to this fire. Praise\nhttps://www.westernjournal.com/biden-officially-attempts-remove-god-thanksgiving-2023-proclamation/,” they wrote.\n“James 1:2 says ‘Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds. For you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have it’s full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing,’” they added.\nIndeed, the fire represents “simply the next chapter in God showing how good and faithful He is.”\nChristians — we might as well admit it — do not always feel gratitude when beset by misfortune.\nHappily, Christianity does not command us to “feel” anything. It commands us, for instance, to love. Then, when we have acted from love, the feelings follow.\n“When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more. If you do him a good turn, you will find yourself disliking him less,” legendary Christian author C.S. Lewis\nwrote in “Mere Christianity.”\nIt works the same way with gratitude. When we thank God amid our problems, we feel the peace that comes from gratitude even though our problems remain.\nThis, I think, relates to humility, which is the obverse of — and antidote to — the deadliest sin of all:\npride.\nIn the Helbergs’ place, prideful people would first have congratulated themselves on a successful business. Then, when disaster struck, prideful people would have cursed the universe, blamed God or even\nquestioned His existence.\nThus, we may thank the Helbergs for their Christian example. And we pray that God will guide them through the rebuilding of their restaurant.\nThis article appeared originally on\nThe Western Journal.",

    "text": "E l presidente del Barcelona , Joan Laporta elogió el gran arranque de campaña que ha tenido el club, con paso perfecto en sus primeros cuatro partidos y una aplastante goleada de 7-0 ante el Valladolid , en un sorprendente desempeño del equipo a manos del alemán, Hansi Flick.\nEn conferencia de prensa este martes, el directivo blaugrana reconoció el presente del equipo y de paso le metió un dardo al ex técnico del equipo, Xavi Hernández, quien entró en crisis el torneo pasado con el club y una plantilla similar.\nEs un entrenador exigente, pero que no busca excusas y se las arregla con lo que tiene\nJoan Laporta sobre Hansi Flick Sin embargo, como reacción a sus comentarios, comenzaron las especulaciones en la prensa española sobre la intención de reprochar a Xavi, quien de manera insistente se quejó de la directiva durante su gestión, por no poder contar con refuerzos de mayor edad, debido a la situación económica del club:\n\"Yo creo que el culé, el barcelonista el aficionado, el socio debe entender que la situación es muy difícil. La situación es complicada, sobre todo a nivel económico, para competir con los máximos competidores, tanto el Madrid en España, como en Europa. Nosotros tenemos una situación económica que no tiene nada que ver con 25 años atrás, que cuando venía el entrenador decía: 'Quiero este, este, este, este y este'. Esto ahora no es así\" , dijo en su momento Hernández.\nSin embargo, también reconoció que entendía la situación en la que se encontraba el club en temas financieros:\n\"Yo creo que el culé, el barcelonista el aficionado, el socio debe entender que la situación es muy difícil. La situación es complicada, sobre todo a nivel económico, para competir con los máximos competidores, tanto el Madrid en España, como en Europa.\n\"Nosotros tenemos una situación económica que no tiene nada que ver con 25 años atrás, que cuando venía el entrenador decía: 'Quiero este, este, este, este y este'. Esto ahora no es así\", dijo en su momento.\nSin embargo, estos comentarios molestaron a Laporta, provocando la ruptura final entre ambos.\nPedri se suma a los elogios a Flick Por su parte, Pedri también ha reconocido el proyecto de trabajo de Flick y los resultados que están teniendo:\n\"Trabajamos mucho más, mucho más duro, y eso se nota en los partidos\", refirió. \" El nivel del equipo no baja después del minuto 70. Se mantiene físicamente. Noto que estoy mucho mejor físicamente y que puedo hacer cosas distintas\".\nIncluso aseguró que se siente más cómodo bajo el mando de Flick: \"Me siento mucho más a gusto.

    "text": "LUBBOCK, Texas ( KCBD /Gray News) - A Texas couple celebrating decades together said that when they first met they just clicked.\nThe Gibsons say they have never thought about leaving one another in the 70 years they’ve been together, and now they’re celebrating their long-lasting vows with their entire family.\n“When we said ‘I do,’ we meant ‘I do,’” Pam Gibson said.\nPam Gibson and her husband, Bill Gibson, first met on a blind date, set up by Pam Gibson’s brother-in-law who was working with Bill Gibson.\n“He was quite a hunk when he come to the front door to get me,” Pam Gibson said.\nAfter their first date at the amusement park, Bill Gibson said it was love at first sight.\n“Oh, I knew she was the one. There wasn’t any question about it,” he said.\nBill Gibson later popped the question, and the two were married on Dec. 21, 1953.\nA few years after they got married, they started their own business, Gibson Plumbing. The two worked together for 35 years, and Bill Gibson said they never argued.\n“Everything’s special about her. I mean, we don’t criticize each other. We never have,” he said.\nAll the while, they balanced business with a growing family.\n“Our oldest son, we were married in December of 1953, and he was born in November of 1954, so we didn’t have much time to think about it,” Pam said.\nThey now have three kids, 11 grandchildren, 29 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. The “memaw” and “pepaw” even built a party house next door to host everyone for get-togethers.\nTheir son Scott Gibson said 70 years is truly momentous.\n“They’ve been a tremendous example. We haven’t always followed their example or their advice, you know, but they’re quite an example of commitment and something to really look up to,” he said.\nPam Gibson said there’s only one boss in the marriage and it’s Bill Gibson. She said she likes not holding that responsibility.\n“We’re best friends, and yes, I don’t know what I’d do without him. And I hope I never have to,” she said.\nPam Gibson said without God, they wouldn’t have made it all these years.\nIf they ever had a disagreement, they waited until the kids were in bed. And no matter what, they always chose to stick together.\n“Never once did I think about leaving him, and I’m sure he felt the same way with me. That wasn’t an option,” Pam Gibson said.\nSaturday, their whole family will celebrate the vows that have lasted 70 years.\n“We’re working for 75 now,” Pam said.\nCopyright 2023 KCBD via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Toronto: Canadian police said it is investigating an incident in which shots were fired at the residence of a Hindu temple's head’s son in British Columbia in the early hours of Wednesday. Police said no one was injured during the incident at the 14900 block of 80 Avenue in Surrey -- the residence of the son of Satish Kumar, president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir. \\\"Officers are still working to determine the motive of this incident,\\\" said Constable Parmbir Kahlon, Media Relations Officer for Surrey RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police). Kahlon added that the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes. According to the Indo-Canadian voice website, as many as 14 shots were fired at the Hindu businessman's house. Police remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage. The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit is conducting the probe, and has appealed to anyone with more information, including dash cam footage of the incident, to get in touch with them. Canada has witnessed a rise in incidents of vandalism and attacks against Hindu temples and installations in the country with pro-Khalistan elements getting active beginning this year. The situation worsened after Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey on June 18 this year. The same Lakshmi Narayan Mandir of Surrey was targeted in August this year after anti-India and pro-Khalistan posters were found pasted on its front and rear walls. Last month, Indian-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya shared a purported video of pro-Khalistan supporters in Surrey, claiming they want to create trouble at the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir. In September, Shri Mata Bhameshwari Durga temple in Surrey was defaced with anti-India and pro-Khalistan graffiti on its outer walls. Incidents of vandalism have also occurred at temples in Brampton and the Greater Toronto area.",

Во время допроса нападавший заявил, что хотел убить врача, передает «КП-Иркутск».\nНа вопрос полиции о мотивах мужчина ответил, что считает себя лишенным права на жизнь согласно Конституции и Конвенции ООН о правах инвалидов. Именно поэтому пациент схватился за нож и планировал совершить убийство врача.\n«Хотел убить врача», — уверенно заявил мужчина.\n«С какой целью?» — поинтересовался полицейский.\n«Меня лишили права на жизнь по конституции по Конвенции ООН о правах инвалидов», — объяснил нападавший.\n«Ну раз это случилось, это же не повод нападать на людей», — сказал правоохранитель.\n«Ну мне наверное виднее», — пояснил задержанный.\nМужчина был обезврежен и задержан на месте преступления. На кадрах с места происшествия видно, что у него перевязана нога.\nНапомним, что утром 3 июня в городской клинической больнице № 8 Ленинского округа Иркутска неизвестный мужчина зашел в здание медицинского учреждения с ножом и газовым баллончиком и напал на персонал. В результате пострадали два сотрудника медицинского учреждения: заместитель главного врача и секретарь больницы.",
