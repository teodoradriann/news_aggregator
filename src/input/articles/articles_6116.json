A equipe enfrenta o Equador amanhã (6) no Couto Pereira e o Paraguai no dia 10 de setembro, em Assunção.\nEm suas redes sociais, o experiente jornalista demonstrou toda a sua confiança nos três atacantes do Real Madrid. O narrador acredita que o trio do clube merengue será titular diante dos equatorianos na capital paranaense.\n“Olha só que bacana. Um dos ataques do Real Madrid. Porque nós não temos lá o francês [Mbappé], mas Rodrygo, Endrick e Vini Júnior. Pra cima do Equador”, incentivou.\nGalvão Bueno comparou lesão de Pedro com a de Neymar\nGalvão aprovou a convocação dos atletas que atuam no Brasil. Assim, lamentou a grave lesão de Pedro, com o centroavante do Flamengo rompendo o ligamento do joelho esquerdo ontem (4), no treino da seleção brasileira em Curitiba.\n“Neymar tá sem jogar desde outubro do ano passado em função de uma contusão dessa”, lamentou Galvão Bueno.\nO ex-locutor esportivo número 1 da Globo demonstrou apoio a dois jogadores que podem ser titulares de Dorival Júnior. Assim, defende a titularidade de Guilherme Arana na lateral-esquerda e de André abrindo o meio-campo.\nO Brasil é o sexto colocado nas Eliminatórias da Copa do Mundo com sete pontos e hoje estaria se classificando na última vaga direta do continente para o Mundial de 2026.\n“É o momento exato da reação. Dorival, força aí. Garotada, pra cima deles. Tem que ganhar. Esse jogo com o Equador tem dois resultados: ganhar ou ganhar”, finalizou.",

    "text": "Fall River's Temple Beth El will be put up for sale. It's the city's last synagogue. [Dan Medeiros](/staff/5917128002/dan-medeiros/) FALL RIVER — [The city’s Jewish community](/story/news/2019/03/29/fall-river-wonders-what-is/5585559007/) is losing its last place of worship. According to a message from Stephen Silverman, president of [Congregation Beth El,](https://www.frtemplebethel.org/) the congregation has “come to a crossroads” and must sell its synagogue at 385 High St. The congregation itself will continue. The move comes after years of decline in the number of congregants and the rising expense of maintaining Temple Beth El, a large, aging building. \"It wasn’t so long ago that we would see at least 200 people at our High Holiday services,” Silverman wrote. “This year, there were 30. Even including those who watched the livestream, the total didn’t reach 50, in a sanctuary that seats 650.” Fall River Wonders: [What is the history of Fall River's Jewish community?](/story/news/2019/03/29/fall-river-wonders-what-is/5585559007/) The congregation is currently led by husband and wife [Rabbi Mark Elber](/story/lifestyle/features/2022/11/04/fall-river-rabbi-mark-elber-wins-morgenthau-prize-for-poetry-book/69600739007/) and Cantor Shoshana Brown. Elber and Brown were not immediately available for comment. Silverman said the congregation’s board decided unanimously to find a broker to sell the Temple Beth El building and possibly to find a new home for the congregants. Silverman wrote that the board is looking to move quickly so there’s no lapse in continuity. “Our primary duty is to keep Congregation Beth El viable well into the future,” Silverman wrote. “As we are the last vestige of Judaism in the greater Fall River area, keeping the congregation alive is more important than ever.” Declining Jewish congregation can't sustain building expenses The building was constructed in 1929, during what Bristol Community College professor and historian Ron Weisberger said was the start of a high point in the city’s Jewish population. “Our 95-year-old temple has numerous building maintenance problems, some of which would require a major investment to correct,” Silverman wrote. “We have already spent 55% of our annual maintenance budget in the first three months of this fiscal year. During the High Holidays, we had to put three buckets in the vestibule to catch water dripping from one of the towers.” He wrote in his email that, at the rate of spending on maintenance, the congregation’s endowment will run dry in five years. A labor of love: [Fall River rabbi wins prize for his first book of poetry](/story/lifestyle/features/2022/11/04/fall-river-rabbi-mark-elber-wins-morgenthau-prize-for-poetry-book/69600739007/) Though [People Incorporated](https://peopleincfr.org/services/preschool/) leases space from the building for its preschool program, providing nearly half of the congregation’s annual revenue, that lease is set to expire in 2025 and will not be renewed. That loss of income will, Silverman wrote, hasten the loss of the endowment. The temple building is on [Fall River's list of significant structures](https://www.fallriverma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fall-River-Register-of-Significant-Structures-JULY-2017.pdf), and is listed with the state's Historical Commission. The last of Fall River's Jewish temples Records show at one time Fall River hosted seven or possibly as many as 12 synagogues. Temple Beth El reached its peak of activity in the 1950s, with 600 families attending services and its own bowling league, Braille class, scout troops and an educational lecture series that covered topics like Thomas Aquinas, the weather, Confucius, Sigmund Freud and Thomas Jefferson. In 2012, the orthodox Congregation Adas Israel on Robeson Street sold its building to an evangelical Christian church, leaving Temple Beth El the last synagogue in the city. Weisberger said most of the Jews that came to Fall River were immigrants, whose children moved away for college and didn’t come back. “That left a much older population,” he said. Silverman wrote that the average congregant’s age is between 75 and 80 years old. Without Temple Beth El, the closest conservative synagogue is Tifareth Israel in New Bedford. United Brothers in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Temple Habonim in Barrington, Rhode Island, are reform synagogues. “There was this very rich, vibrant Jewish community in Fall River, and it declined over the years,\" Weisberger said. “It’s one of the stories of Fall River but also of the Jewish community in the country, which has demographically shifted. “This is the last of the synagogues, which is to my mind very sad.” Dan Medeiros can be reached at [dmedeiros@heraldnews.com](mailto:dmedeiros@heraldnews.com).

    "text": "This New Year’s Eve the Boise Police Department reminds you to celebrate safely and responsibly. If your plans include alcohol, BPD asks that you please plan for a safe way home. According to data from the Idaho Transportation Department 248 people have died in crashes on our roads so far in 2023, which is up from 215 last year. Unfortunately, alcohol or drug impairment is one of the common contributing factors. “Drunk drivers on the road pose a threat to other drivers, vehicle passengers, and pedestrians, don’t let your night take a turn for the worse by drinking and driving,” said Boise Police Sgt. Jason Pietrzak. BPD recommends the following safe alternatives to drinking and driving: · Plan a safe way home before your celebrations begin. If it is your turn to be the designated driver, take that role seriously, your friends are relying on you. · If you’re impaired, use a taxi, Uber, Lyft, or call a sober friend or family member to get home safely. “This New Year’s Eve we need all eyes on the road and that also means if you see something, say something. We encourage drivers who notice possible impaired driving to call 911,” said Sgt. Pietrzak. “If possible and safe to do so, write down license plates, and get a description of the vehicle and its direction of travel.” Sober drivers are encouraged to: · Call 9-1-1 if you see a possible drunk driver on the road. · Watch for impaired pedestrians. · Stay focused on the road and remain vigilant. According to data from the Idaho Office of Highway Safety, last year in Idaho there were 1,818 impaired driving crashes, and 110 people were killed. “A traffic ticket or DUI charge could cost you hundreds of dollars but crashes resulting in injury or death are far worse. Don’t risk any of it this New Years Eve,” warned Sgt. Pietrzak.",

    "text": "Where to find some ‘me’ time in LA’s great outdoors Warm weather and clear skies are the perfect excuse to get outside. Los Angeles County’s sprawling landscape can be intimidating to navigate, especially if you're looking for a green space to enjoy. But the L.A. region is home to many nature-filled spots — from the obvious mountains and coastline to pretty parks off busy boulevards. Still, there are so many places to check out we needed some help and asked How To LA listeners and readers for a few of their favorite places. Wow, did they deliver. We’ve compiled a list of their suggestions below, and most are FREE to access. You can also listen to our latest episode to hear directly from a handful of them about what makes their pick special. Greystone Mansion (Beverly Hills) Greystone Mansion is hidden among the residential neighborhoods of Beverly Hills. Once owned by the descendants of L.A.-oil magnate Edward Doheny, the mansion and its grounds have served as a public park since 1971. - Learn which beaches are affected for the holiday - Ethnic studies legislation passes key hurdle - ASL interpretation added to LAUSD meetings For almost a century, the mansion has been a go-to Hollywood backdrop for film and TV backdrop. Its black and white tiled interior can be spotted in Elton John’s “I Want Love” music video featuring Robert Downey Jr. and the 2007 film There Will Be Blood (which is loosely based on the Doheny family). In her iconic music video for “We Belong Together,” Mariah Carey ran down its driveway in a wedding dress. “Greystone Mansion is the epitome of what makes LA special. It has the rich history, a prominent family, the personality, the beauty, the views, and of course the movie industry tied to it.” — L.A. resident Kathy Melamed Address: 905 Loma Vista Dr, Beverly Hills, CA 90210 Hours: 10 a.m. - 6 p.m., 7 days a week Price: Free ($10 per person for a tour) Beverly Gardens Park (Beverly Hills) Beverly Gardens Park is a slice of natural beauty right off Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills. Its well-known for the Beverly Hills sign, but its 2 miles of forested paths is a favorite of listener Nancy Sherman Kim: \"It offers beautiful rose gardens, a cactus garden, Roman fountains, Grecian sitting area and the friendly familiar faces of your fellow neighbors.” Nancy uses the “fountain-to-fountain” path as a post-work walk spot. But even a casual one-time visit is enough to absorb some of the path’s idyllic features. For fans of contemporary art, the path features a sculpture of psychedelic tulips from famed artist Yayoi Kusama called “Hymn of Life” off Rodeo Drive. Address: Santa Monica Boulevard between Wilshire & Doheny Drive Beverly Hills, CA 90210 Hours: 6 a.m. to 9:30pm, 7 days a week Price: Entry is free. Beverly Hills Public Parking Structures are available across Santa Monica Boulevard for $2 per hour. Sandstone Peak Sandstone Peak is the highest point on the Santa Monica Mountains. The hike is moderately challenging, but the views are well worth it, according to listener Robert Bittner: “The height barrier formed by the Santa Monica Mountains traps coastal clouds and fog. And as the temperatures rise, they sneak their way up into the canyons and over the Bonys. I love the way they climb to meet me, bathing me in their soothing mist as they travel towards Simi Valley and beyond.” There are two adjacent trails to the peak: a 1.5-mile direct path to the summit and Mishe Mokwa Trail, a 6-mile loop. Robert recommends taking the Mishe Mokwa Trail to enjoy ecological wonders of the upper Carlisle Canyon on the path. Note: The 2018 Woolsey Fire destroyed the steps to the summit, so reaching the peak will require some agility. Address: 12896 Yerba Buena Road, Malibu, CA 90265 Hours: Open 24/7. Price: Free Huntington Central Park (Huntington Beach) Huntington Central Park is an expansive green area in Orange County’s Huntington Beach. The park hosts all of the common recreational amenities like sports fields and lakes. However, its Equestrian Center and Urban Forest makes it stand out. Listener Annette Berman used to keep a horse at the center, but now she frequents the park to walk her dog through the Urban Forest and watch other equestrians ride on the paths. The Urban Forest is maintained by the [Huntington Beach Tree Society](https://hbtrees.org/urban-forest-2/) (HB Trees). Their selection of flora is a mix of native Californian shrubbery along Mediterranean and Australian drought-resistant plants. Definitely a spot to see for botanical enthusiasts. Address: 18381 Goldenwest St., Huntington Beach, CA 92648 (Urban Forest: 711 Ellis Ave, Huntington Beach, CA 92648) Hours: 5 a.m. to 10 p.m (Urban Forest: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.) Price: Free Wattles Garden Park (Hollywood) Situated below Runyon Canyon, Wattles Garden Park is not far from the heart of Hollywood. This property is another mansion turned public park. The Wattles Estate was built in 1907 by Nebraska businessman Gurdon Wattles, and designed by the same architects behind the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Rose Bowl. Listener Andy Keown recommended it as a place of respite from the city: “It has a rolling beautiful green lawn in front of the big house, and people just come and gather and hang out.” There’s a great sprawling view of Hollywood, and the rest of the city, from the lawn’s elevated vantage point. The park’s trails also feature a number of quirky art projects and spiritual shrines to explore. Address: 1850 N Curson Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046 Hours: 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Price: Free Ascot Hills Park (East LA) Ascot Hills is the spot to catch a sunset. The money shot is of the sun descending next to a picture-perfect silhouette of DTLA’s high rises. For listener María Patiño Gutierrez, this spot stands out for its friendly atmosphere and fresh air. Beyond the views, the park features several beginner-friendly hiking trails on its rolling hills. With so many paths to choose from, it's possible to chart a new course with every visit. Address: 4371 Multnomah St., Los Angeles, CA 90032 Hours: 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Price: Free Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook (Culver City) The Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook, also known as the Culver City Steps, is perched at the edge of Culver City. The top of the trail features 360-degree views of L.A. With those views comes a rigorous climb, which makes for a great outdoors workout. Listener Harrison Woliner proposed to his wife at the top of the climb: “One of the beautiful things about this particular park is not only does it have great views of the city, they preserve it pretty well with wild vegetation.” Unlike the rest of the spots on this list, Baldwin Hills does not allow dogs to protect the natural habitat. While Fido will need to stay home, the health of the wild vegetation and animals enhance the outdoorsy feel of the spot. Address: 6300 Hetzler Road, Culver City, CA 90232 Hours: 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., 7 days a week Price: Entry is free. Parking is $2 per hour or $6 per day. Palos Verdes Beach (Rancho Palos Verdes) Palos Verdes Beach is one of the southernmost points of L.A. County. Its Terranea Beach is a secluded spot to lounge and soak in the sun or try out kayaking. The coastline also makes for a scenic walk. While there’s the Terranea Beach Trail to follow, listener Lyn Watanabe has carved out her own route. Parking at Vanderlip Park, she heads west following the coastline on the Beach Trail. Midway into the journey, she recommends stopping at Terranea Resort to enjoy their manicured landscape. Then, as the trail ends, continue through Pelican Cove Park to the Point Vicente Lighthouse. At the lighthouse, there’s a museum on the history of Palos Verdes. It’s also a prime spot for whale watching. Make sure to head down from December to April for the best chance of watching them leap out of the water. Address: 6500 Sea Cove Dr., Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275 (Vanderlip Park) Hours: Open 1 hour before sunset to 1 hour after sunset. (Lighthouse is open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.) Price: Free - The peak of #VanLife may have ended just as COVID restrictions lifted, the movement's had a lasting impact. - It's not just any hedge. It's the one that appeared in the 1978 classic horror film, \"Halloween.\" - For the first time in 17 years, the Dodgers did not win a single postseason game — and fans unleashed the memes. - According to the City of Los Angeles, the car company can break ground on the project. - The victory came courtesy of a Louis Lappe walk-off home run. - A hike can be a beautiful backdrop as you build your connection with someone.",

Para Jayne Ozanne, exmiembro del sínodo y activista Lgbtq, la presencia de mujeres en el episcopado representa “una diferencia importante”. “Las obispas muestran más empatía con las víctimas y son conscientes de cómo las estructuras de poder de la Iglesia de Inglaterra pueden oprimir a la gente”, dijo.\nLa obispa Helen-Ann Hartley es una de las voces más críticas contra el sucesor de Welby, Stephen Cottrell, quien asumió, de forma temporal, el cargo de líder de la Iglesia de Inglaterra el 6 de enero.\nCottrell está siendo cuestionado por mantener en el cargo a un sacerdote a quien la institución prohibió estar solo con niños tras varios casos de agresión sexual.",

    "text": "If enthusiasm for a job could light a lamp, Kristin Baumann, the new head librarian at the Aldrich Public Library, could light the city. “It’s a real treat to be sitting here, in this beautiful, historic building. Everyone involved with this library has a strong sense of community. That’s the main reason I accepted this job,” Baumann said from her second-floor office. Baumann, who started at the Aldrich in October, spent the past 12 years as director of the Island Free Library on tiny Block Island, Rhode Island. Although the two communities are vastly different both in geography and community, both are proud of their town and proud of their library, she said. “I lived on Block Island for 30 years. I moved there because the people had an inherent sense of community, a commitment to making it a better place for everyone. I get the same feeling here in Barre,” she said. “The library on Block Island was a central hub for the community. The library here in Barre also is a central hub,” she said. The recent Light Up the Library fundraiser, she said, was a perfect example of the community support. “I was overwhelmed by the support for the library,” she said. Two of Baumann’s main goals are to make sure the library remains at the center of what she sees as a revival of the city, especially following the July flood, and to expand the library’s role in solving the social service issues of the community. “I think libraries are on the front lines of the social, economic and mental health issues of their communities. I want the library to be part of the solution. We’re doing good things here, but we’re not alone in the good work that is going on in Barre,” she said. Baumann said she is considering providing space in the building for staff from local social service agencies. “I’m trained to run a library. I’m not trained to deal with some of the issues we see every day. As a vital member of the community, we cannot retreat from the needs of our neighbors,” she said. “The core of this library will remain what it has always been: the books,” Baumann said. In Fiscal Year 2023, 89,132 books, audiobooks, e-books, magazines and the online database were used by Aldrich patrons. There were 63,855 visits to the two branches, Barre City and Barre Town, and the library offered 291 programs, such as the Authors at the Aldrich, Teen Night and the Lego Club for kids. Nancy Pope, president of the Aldrich board of trustees, said Baumann’s zeal for the job was key to hiring her. “We’re delighted to have Kristin as our new librarian. She has an understanding of the mission of the library and a passion for service to the community,” Pope said. “She brings a passion for library work and believes in the importance of libraries in building communities.” Baumann manages a staff of 11. The FY2024 budget is $705,692. Through donations and fundraising, the library projects to raise $85,000. Barre City contributes $250,170; Barre Town, $200,122. “The remainder of funds needed to balance the budget comes from grants that we secure, fees and services, and our library investment accounts and endowments. These accounts are extremely important to our financial stability and have all been established through gifts from donors. We are grateful for all contributions to our work and success,” Baumann said. In addition to hiring Baumann as the new director, the Aldrich trustees also promoted Garrett Grant, who served as interim director from June to October, to assistant director. Garrett will continue his duties as Young Adult and New Technology Librarian, as well as take on new responsibilities. “The trustees are very appreciative of the dedicated work, which Garrett has done while serving as our interim library director. In addition to the many tasks as director, he worked to organize flood relief efforts at the library and partnered with other community groups to serve those in need,” Pope said.
