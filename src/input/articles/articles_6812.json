    "text": "'A huge wave of antisemitism': Jewish scholars keep Ohioans educated about Israeli history [Zach Tuggle](https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/staff/4395274002/zach-tuggle/) [Discrimination against Jewish people](/story/news/nation/2024/02/13/american-jews-behavior-identity-safety-israel-hamas-war/72577331007/) has continued to rise in recent months, sometimes in communities where it would seem almost impossible for the prejudice to exist. Ohio is not immune to pockets of antisemitic beliefs, a pair of scholars from Israel warned during a recent meeting with Dr. Carlos Campo, president of Ashland University and Ashland Theological Seminary. Sarah Levy and Dr. Yossi Kugler visited the AU campus from Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem. Their trip to Ohio was designed to raise awareness on [modern threats of antisemitism](/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/01/08/israel-assassinate-hamas-oct-7/72107707007/), offer reminders about the Holocaust and provide a greater understanding of the history of Jewish people. Campo hopes the partnership between AU and Yad Vashem continues. 'A huge wave of antisemitism' Jews have found themselves the target of assault many times throughout history. The world conjured some of its most intense Jewish hate in 1967 as Israelis rallied [during the Six Day War](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/six-day-war) to defend their young nation against aggressions from Egypt, Syria and Jordan, which were backed in part by the Soviet Union. Contempt rose again globally in 1973 after Israel fought off a two-front attack from Egypt and Syria that came on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year − [that conflict was named the Yom Kippur War](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/yom-kippur-war). The latest ambush was Oct. 7 when [a Hamas attack left 1,200 Israelis dead](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-attack-oct-7-israel-militants-concert-866ac59803d23dfc03146c8d272670cc) and another 240 taken into Gaza as hostages. \"The massacre of Oct. 7 was accompanied by a huge wave of antisemitism that the world has not seen maybe since the Holocaust,\" Kugler explained. The Jerusalem native said the past few months have made some Jewish people wonder if Zionism has failed. \"The vision of Zionism was that finally when the Jews have a land of their own, maybe antisemitism would stop,\" Kugler said. \"This is an ongoing discussion in Israel.\" 'We need to stop this' An important lesson the scholars hope Ohioans remember is that antisemitism eventually can extend to people of all religions and ethnicities. \"What starts with the Jews never finishes with the Jews,\" Levy said. \"Usually, the Jews are the first ones.\" The granddaughter of Holocaust survivors [referenced the famous Rev. Martin Niemöller quote](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists): \"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out − because I was not a socialist. ... Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out − because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me − and there was no one left to speak for me.\" People worldwide today need to speak up in support of one another. \"We've learned that the hard way,\" Levy said. She and other scholars at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center still aren't sure what [the October attack](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-israel-unaccounted-people-095f64d06108416ff9c58ea7550b9a74) \"means for Israel, for the Jewish people, and for humanity as a whole.\" \"As impossibly traumatizing as the 7th of October was for me, the 8th of October was a harder − much harder − day for me, seeing the world reaction to what our country suffered,\" Levy said. \"We need to stop this − this hating, this other-ing − for all people, all around the world.\" 'Live side-by-side together and teach each other' Antisemites today are trying to downplay the significance of the Holocaust, even sometimes saying it never happened. The scholars say the best safeguard against those lies is simple: \"Educate, educate, educate.\" Even in states like Ohio, where large populations of Jewish people live in Cleveland and Columbus, everyone should beware antisemitism can sneak in and take hold. \"In Germany on the outskirt of the Second World War, less than 1% of the German population was Jewish,\" Levy said. \"Yet they managed − this party managed − to create a hatred against those people.\" She explained most Germans in the 1930s had never met a Jewish person, which made them susceptible to the NAZI party's propaganda. \"I'm hoping that in the states that do have large Jewish populations, that this knowledge of who these people are, to see them as regular people, I would hope that would reduce levels of antisemitism,\" Levy said. \"That's our dream, that different people can live side-by-side together and teach each other about different cultures.\" ztuggle@gannett.com 419-564-3508",

    "text": "Back to top\nDes agents du Service des forêts sud-coréen observent les graves incendies qui ont ravagé le sud-est du pays, le 27 mars 2025 à Andong\nLes températures mondiales sont restées à des niveaux historiquement élevés en avril, poursuivant une série de près de deux ans de chaleur inédite sur la planète qui agite le milieu scientifique sur la vitesse du réchauffement climatique.\nAu niveau mondial, avril 2025 se classe deuxième plus chaud derrière avril 2024, selon l'observatoire européen Copernicus, qui se fonde sur des milliards de mesures issues de satellites, stations météo et autres outils.\nLe mois dernier prolonge ainsi une série ininterrompue de records ou quasi-records de températures qui dure depuis juillet 2023, soit bientôt deux ans.\nDepuis lors, à une exception près, tous les mois ont été au moins 1,5°C plus chauds que la moyenne de l'ère préindustrielle (1850-1900).\nDe nombreux scientifiques s'attendaient pourtant à ce que la période 2023-2024 -- les deux années les plus chaudes jamais mesurées dans le monde -- soit suivie d'un répit, lorsque les conditions plus chaudes du phénomène El Nino s'estomperaient.\nFichier vidéo\n\"Il semble que nous y soyons coincés\" et \"ce qui l'explique n'est pas entièrement résolu, mais c'est un signe très inquiétant\", a-t-il déclaré à l'AFP.\nLes deux dernières années \"ont été exceptionnelles\", dit à l'AFP Samantha Burgess, du centre européen qui opère Copernicus. \"Elles restent dans la fourchette de ce que les modèles climatiques prédisaient pour aujourd'hui, mais on est dans le haut de la fourchette\".\nUne des explications repose sur le fait que le phénomène La Nina, inverse d'El Nino et synonyme d'influence rafraîchissante, n'est finalement que de \"faible intensité\" depuis décembre, selon l'Organisation météorologique mondiale, et pourrait déjà décliner dans les prochains mois.\nUne cinquantaine de climatologues réputés, conduits par le britannique Piers Forster, estiment que le climat était déjà réchauffé en moyenne de 1,36°C en 2024. C'est la conclusion d'une version préliminaire de leur étude qui actualise chaque année les chiffres clés du Giec, les experts du climat mandatés par l'ONU. Copernicus a une estimation actuelle très proche, de 1,39°C.\nLe monde se rapproche d'un réchauffement de 1,5°C\nLe seuil de 1,5°C de réchauffement, le plus ambitieux de l'accord de Paris, est sur le point d'être atteint de façon stabilisée, calculée sur plusieurs décennies, estiment nombre de scientifiques. Copernicus pense que cela pourra être le cas d'ici 2029.\n\"C'est dans quatre ans. La réalité est que nous allons dépasser 1,5°C\", dit Samantha Burgess.\n\"Au rythme actuel, le 1.5°C sera battu avant 2030\", estime aussi Julien Cattiaux, climatologue du CNRS joint par l'AFP. \"On dit que chaque dixième de degré compte\", car il multiplie les sécheresses, canicules et autres catastrophes météorologiques \"mais actuellement, ils défilent vite\", s'alarme le scientifique.\nMais \"maintenant, ce qu'il faut essayer de faire, c'est d'avoir un réchauffement climatique le plus proche possible\" de la cible initiale car \"ce n'est pas pareil si on vise un climat réchauffé de 2°C en fin de siècle ou de 4°C\", rappelle-t-il.\nVue aérienne de véhicules transférant du charbon dans un port à Chongqing, dans le sud-ouest de la Chine, le 20 avril 2025\nQue la combustion des énergies fossiles - charbon, pétrole et gaz - soit responsable de l'essentiel du réchauffement ne fait pas débat parmi les climatologues.\nMais les discussions et les études se multiplient pour quantifier l'influence climatique de l'évolution des nuages, d'une baisse de la pollution atmosphérique ou de celle des capacités de la Terre à stocker le carbone dans des puits naturels tels que les forêts et les océans.\nLes relevés annuels de températures mondiales remontent jusqu'en 1850. Mais les carottes de glace, les sédiments au fond de l'océan et d'autres \"archives climatiques\" permettent d'établir que le climat actuel est sans précédent depuis au moins 120.000 ans.",

    "title": "SPS won’t reschedule graduations that fall on Muslim holiday | The Seattle Times",
    "text": "Muslim students at three Seattle high schools have a difficult choice to make on June 17: Celebrate Eid al-Adha, one of the most important Muslim holidays, with their families or attend their graduations, an important rite of passage. Some Muslim students at Cleveland High School alerted their principal to the dilemma last October when they noticed that their 2024 graduation was scheduled on Eid al-Adha, the Muslim holiday marking the Prophet Ibrahim’s submission to Allah’s (God’s) command to sacrifice his son, Ishmael. But the students said the outreach to their administration and follow-up efforts with Seattle Public Schools officials went nowhere. Last month, a coalition of students from Garfield, Cleveland and Franklin high schools spoke during a School Board meeting, asking the district publicly to change the graduation date. The change, they said, would ensure that Muslim students won’t have to choose between their faith and a significant milestone. Although the date for Eid al-Adha changes from year to year based on a lunar calendar, it was clear last fall when the holiday would be celebrated in 2024. The state superintendent’s office lists common public and religious holidays and guidance for districts on its website. CAIR-WA, a Muslim civil rights organization, also annually alerts districts statewide to the dates of the two major holidays — Eid al-Fitr, which is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha — before the school year starts. Some said that scheduling the ceremonies on a Muslim holiday and the lack of engagement from the district made Muslim students, families and staff feel excluded and ran counter to the district’s pronouncements on equity and its aim to center students “furthest from educational justice.” One former SPS student, who supported the request and spoke at the meeting, said the district would never schedule graduation on a patriotic or Christian holiday. In addition to Cleveland, Garfield’s and The Center School’s graduations are also set for June 17. The district said it planned to meet with the students and religious leaders in the community, who had written to the district backing the students’ request. But in a statement this month, the students said they were told that it was unlikely that the graduation ceremonies would be rescheduled because it was too late to do so. “We, as Muslim students, are standing up for and advocating for our rights,” the students said. “Despite our persistence, the school and district administration have been stalling, passing us off to other school or district officials, and not taking our concerns seriously.” The students said they got support from their peers and teachers and collected 284 signatures on a petition to reschedule the graduation ceremonies. Yet the district has not given a “compelling reason why graduation was scheduled on a date with a known conflict and why the school and district refuse to change it.” The request has also gained the support of a state organization for Muslim civil rights. “Eid al-Adha is the most significant holiday of the year in Islam, and we deserve to be able to practice our faith with our families and celebrate our high school graduation with our peers,” they wrote. The holiday is also celebrated at the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which millions of Muslims undertake annually. Families generally attend morning prayers at the mosque during Eid al-Adha and spend time with family and friends in the afternoon. The district confirmed in a statement that the “graduation schedule will proceed as originally planned.” When asked earlier this month why commencement ceremonies were scheduled on Eid al-Adha and whether the district knew the dates would clash, Beverly Redmond, the district’s chief of staff and spokesperson, said: “I am not going to say that we weren’t aware of the calendar, but just exactly when it would fall. There is that acknowledgment that there could be some variation in that and that’s where that’s centered.” The district said it would continue to work with faith leaders “about possible recommendations for next year’s commencement planning.” In recent years, some school districts, particularly those on the East Coast, have [expanded the number of religious holidays](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Flocal%2Feducation%2Fmd-school-system-keeps-jewish-holidays-adds-days-off-for-diwali-lunar-new-year-and-eid-al-adha%2F2016%2F01%2F15%2Fd0aab354-bae4-11e5-b682-4bb4dd403c7d_story.html&data=05%7C02%7Cdsuperville%40seattletimes.com%7C7271257d91c04021cd7008dc792fa4e9%7Cfc2b8476b7f0473d82fbe0a89fd99855%7C0%7C0%7C638518492763831934%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZgUbBsF0bypAr%2B5vNpakkZFw3T7TItnynd%2BsdG89lx0%3D&reserved=0) in the school calendar to include Muslim and Hindu holidays.

[On its website](https://ospi.k12.wa.us/policy-funding/equity-and-civil-rights/information-families-civil-rights-washington-schools/religion-schools/common-religious-and-us-public-holiday-calendars), Washington’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction encourages districts not to schedule “significant school events” on common religious and public holidays in order to ensure that all students feel like “they are a meaningful part of their school communities and that their religious traditions matter.” It notes that some dates are not fixed and are based on moon sightings. It lists the date of Eid al-Adha in the 2023-24 academic year as June 16-17. In an April 24 letter, CAIR-WA wrote to the district on the students’ behalf asking for “reasonable accommodation” to their request. “Students practicing their right to religious expression should not be excluded from educational spaces, nor denied reasonable accommodation,” Hannah Vickner Hough, CAIR-WA’s legal director, wrote. “A graduation ceremony with one’s classmates is a formative experience for most students and the district should seek to provide appropriate arrangements to assure Muslim students are not unfairly excluded from this experience.” Vickner Hough said that since the religious holidays are included in OSPI’s document, SPS’ decision to schedule graduations on Eid al-Adha was either the result of “oversight, or negligence, or just disregard.” The students, she said, were discouraged by the district’s response to their advocacy and request to reschedule the ceremonies. “It can possibly show they are not as worthy of celebration as other students,” Vickner Hough said. “It puts them in a precarious position of choosing to have to practice their faith and celebrate with classmates.” This year’s graduation holds deep significance to students, who started their high school experience during the pandemic, Vickner Hough said. “This is a very meaningful expression of what they have been through as students,” she said. “So not being able to access that as Muslim students is really disappointing.” Vickner Hough urged districts to review the OSPI calendar. “It’s not hidden information,” she said. “They don’t need to consider requests for accommodations if they consider [it] in advance.”",
