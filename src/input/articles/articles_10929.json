    "text": "Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter fired Brighton to their first Premier League win since November as they sank Ipswich 2-0 at Portman Road.\nMitoma scored his fourth goal of the season and Rutter hit his third in two matches as Fabian Hurzeler’s side climbed back into the top half of the table, having been winless in their previous eight league matches.\nIpswich had jumped out of the relegation zone without kicking a ball after Wolves’ heavy defeat at Newcastle on Wednesday night.\nBut they are now back in it on goals scored after fluffing their lines at home again.\nKieran McKenna’s side picked up their first Portman Road win against Chelsea last time out, but they have amassed just four points from their other 10 home games this season.\nBrighton, back in East Anglia five days after thumping Norwich 4-0 in the FA Cup, began the match on the front foot but without really threatening their former goalkeeper Christian Walton.\nMitoma tried his luck from the edge of the box and Joao Pedro headed goalwards from a corner but Walton, who made six appearances in nine years on the south coast, kept both out.\nSeagulls defender Jan Paul van Hecke was convinced he should have had a penalty when he was wrestled to the ground by Wes Burns at another corner, but referee Tony Harrington was not interested.\nThen, slowly, Ipswich began to threaten, first when Nathan Broadhead collected the ball near halfway.\nThe midfielder strode forward, cutting inside Joel Veltman before aiming for the far post, forcing a fine save from Bart Verbruggen.\nBrighton’s Dutch keeper was called into action again moments later to hold a curler from Liam Delap.\nAs the first half drew to a close Omari Hutchinson also had a pop from long range, with Verbruggen diving low to his right to scramble the ball away from danger.\nDelap had enjoyed a running battle with Van Hecke throughout the first half, but it was an off-the-ball barge into the back of Veltman which earned the striker a booking at the start of the second.\nPedro followed Delap into Harrington’s notebook, and was perhaps lucky not to receive more than a yellow card for a dangerous body-check on Walton.\nThe breakthrough came in the 59th minute when Yasin Ayari reached the byline and cut the ball back.\nMatt O’Riley helped it on to Mitoma, who fired low through a crowded penalty area and underneath Walton from 15 yards.\nBrighton almost doubled their lead five minutes later when Pedro turned and shot towards the top corner but Walton pulled off a stunning save to tip it over the crossbar.\nInstead the second arrived eight minutes from full-time when Ayari’s low free-kick found substitute Rutter, who spun and slotted past Walton to wrap up Brighton’s win.\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",

A spokesperson for the BIAL said that 13 domestic flights, three international passenger flights, and one international cargo flight were rerouted to Chennai due to the adverse weather conditions on Friday.\nThe stormy weather also toppled numerous trees across various parts of the city, including Jayanagar, Nrupathunga Nagar, and RR Nagar, the agency reported.

    "text": "Mental Health\nTherapist on TikTok perfectly explains 'glimmering' and how it's vital for our health\nCue the calmness.\nWhat is a glimmer? No I’m not talking about \"Twilight\" vampires or the princess from my favorite Netflix cartoon.\nGlimmering is the opposite of a trigger. A word we’ve all become very familiar with.\nWhere triggers tighten our stomachs, make it hard to breath and generally signal danger (even when no danger is present), a glimmer gives us a sigh of relief, helping us to feel safe and secure. And though both terms were identified by psychologist Deb Dana in her book “The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy,” most of us have only been taught to find what triggers us in life. Because, well, we have to survive before we can thrive.\nBut thanks to TikTok savvy therapists such as Dr. Justine, glimmers have taken on new life and people are excited to learn about the concept. You could say that finding new ways to reclaim hope is indeed going viral.\nIn a video that has now been viewed over 78,000 times, Dr. Justine breaks down the glimmer basics.\n[@heydrjustine]Glimmers✨ are the opposite of triggers.[#AVrboForTogether][#SoFiBreakUpChallenge][#AlaskaAirCAREoke][#anxietyrelief][#nervoussystem][#traumahealing][♬ New Home - Austin Farwell]\n“Glimmers are anything that sparks a sense of joy, awe, or belongingness. It can be noticing the warmth of the sun, something beautiful around you, or seeing a kind face,” her caption reads.\nIf this sounds enticing to you, you’re not alone. One person—clearly eager to find their own sparks of joy—wrote, “ugh yes love glimmer hunting.”\nWhich begs the question: How can we form a glimmer hunting group?\n“Purposely noticing glimmers allows you to tap into micro moments on Ventral Vagal energy (a state of groundedness and connectedness),” Dr. Justine continues.\nThe vagus nerve carries messages from our brain to other parts of our body. It’s what sends you into flight-or-fight mode when there’s a perceived threat. Mine happens to go on the fritz anytime I’m riding in the passenger seat. And I mean every time. My shoulders go up to my ears, everything appears to move chaotically and I can’t resist the urge to hold onto the grab handle for dear life. It doesn't matter who’s driving. It always feels like I'm careening down the fast lane toward my doom. That’s the vagus nerve, doing vagus nervy things.\nHowever, that same nerve can stimulate a completely different sensation: calm. Yes, our bodies are quite literally a walking bundle of contradictions. But we can use that to our advantage by finding the glimmers.\nThe glimmers we find can be simple. A walk in nature, pet cuddles, our favorite song. Even the smallest, most fleeting moments can help activate our vagus nerve to send a signal to our body that says, “Hey, we can relax, everything is perfectly OK right now.”\nAnd the best part is: By holding onto these feelings for at least 30 seconds, we can teach our brains to consistently retain positive thoughts. Or, as Dr. Justine puts it, “turn that glimmer into a glow.”\n“This is my first time hearing this word and ima hold on tight to it,” one person commented, ready for their glow up.\nDr. Justine adds “doing this purposefully is important because humans have a negativity bias towards scanning for threats/danger (especially after trauma).”\nWe are already hardwired to scan for the negative. Again, survival trumps all. But after a traumatic event, our drive to protect ourselves is even more hypervigilant. And yet, safety cues are just as important as danger cues. Regulation is just as vital to our health and stimulation. Balance is often the foundation to our well-being.\n“This is fascinating, scientifically supporting the old saying about stopping to smell the roses,” one person noticed.\nAfter watching Dr. Justine’s video, people started sharing their own glimmers. Three rainbows. The smell of lavender. The cracking of creme brulee. A hit of fresh air. Small things that still managed to light folks up in a big way. This is what glimmering is all about. It was a very happy comment section.\nIf geeking out on science is a form of glimmering for you, you could always read Deb Dana’s book. Or you could check out Dr. Justine’s TikTok for more bite-sized information. Or hey, just go back to basics and smell the roses. There doesn’t seem to be a wrong way to glimmer. What matters is knowing it can dramatically change your mental health.\nThis article originally appeared on 3.24.22",

Lions head coach Rick Campbell believes Nathan Rourke is just getting rolling since returning from the NFL last month.\nRourke will make his fourth consecutive start when the Lions (6-6) visit the league-leading Montreal Alouettes (10-1) at Molson Stadium on Friday night.\nAfter a couple rough outings, the Canadian quarterback bounced back last week by going 21-for-30 for 325 passing yards, three touchdowns and one interception in a 38-12 win over the Ottawa Redblacks in his hometown of Victoria.\n“He’s going to continue to get better and better as he gets into a groove and gets more comfortable,” Campbell said. “He came out of a situation where he had just been through two NFL playbooks and two NFL training camps, and then kind of got thrown into the fire here.\n“It’s good for him to now have a few weeks of being in the same spot.”\nQB Vernon Adams, who was having a stellar season before sustaining a knee injury, will suit up for the first time since Aug. 1 as Rourke’s backup.\nCampbell said he wouldn’t rule out using both pivots in a game down the line. But as Adams eases back into form, Rourke is the guy.\nRourke also rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown as B.C. snapped a five-game skid against Ottawa.\n“They have a little momentum,” Montreal linebacker Darnell Sankey said. “First couple games I don’t think Rourke really performed at his best, but he had a good last game and kind of showed the league what he’s about.”\nAlouettes head coach Jason Maas said Rourke is a “proven commodity” in the CFL after he took the league by storm in a record-breaking 2022 season.\n“We all know what he can do and what he’s capable of,” Maas said. “We got to play great team defence, tackle well, control the line of scrimmage and hit him and hit the ball carriers and take it away.”\nRourke will match up against the CFL’s top defence with the Alouettes conceding a league-low 18.7 offensive points per game.\nMontreal also boasts the league’s second-best offence this season, and has already clinched a spot in the playoffs that won’t begin until November.\nNext up, they’re hoping to secure their position atop the East Division.\n“We want to clinch that first-round bye. Win one game and you’re in the Grey Cup,” QB Cody Fajardo said. “Clinching is great because we know our ticket is punched, but the job’s not finished, we gotta find a way to get a home game in front of our crowd after a bye week.”\nThe Alouettes are returning from a bye week, while the Lions are facing a short turnaround after playing Ottawa on the other side of the country Saturday.\nMontreal will have to keep stacking wins without wide receiver Austin Mack for now. The Alouettes added Mack to the six-game injured list Friday after he injured his ankle at practice Wednesday.\nMack returned from a stint with the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons in Week 12 and signed a four-year extension with the Alouettes last week. He joins a long list of injured receivers, including Tyson Philpot, Kaion Julien-Grant and Tyler Snead.\nCampbell still expects the Lions to have their work cut out for them.\n“They’re a good team on offence, defence, special teams. They’re good at everything,” Campbell said. “They compete and play hard the way you’re supposed to play, and they have a knack for winning close games.”\nThe Lions are tied atop a tight West Division. Besides Rourke, they’ve added Canadian defensive lineman Mathieu Betts after he spent training camp with the NFL’s Detroit Lions. Betts will play his second game this season Friday.\nMeanwhile, former Alouettes running back William Stanback is in fine form.\nStanback returns to face his former team after five seasons in Montreal, which released the tailback last off-season. Stanback ranks second in the league in rushing yards (810) and had 92 rushing yards and 78 receiving yards in the win against Ottawa, leading B.C. in both categories.\n“He’s gonna come out and try to do his thing. Obviously, he used to play here, I’m sure he thinks about that,” Sankey said. “Yeah, he’s a good running back, nothing we ain’t faced before. At the end of the day, it’s just a number.”\nThe Alouettes had already sold 22,000 tickets as of Wednesday evening and expected a sellout crowd come kickoff Friday. The ticket sales continue a streak of solid attendance for Montreal this season after the team’s Grey Cup championship.\nCampbell expects the Lions to have a difficult time play-calling at Molson Stadium.\n“While it’ll be hard on our offence at times, I’m glad for the Alouettes and the CFL that it’s going well,” he said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 5, 2024.",
