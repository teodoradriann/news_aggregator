    "text": "RAD GRADS At the top of his class\nAngelo Hinkle should never be underestimated.\nThe Venture Academy senior is a young man with the drive and ambition to succeed in life. Considering the chaos and storms in his home life, Angelo found Venture Academy as a safe harbor.\n“I loved school,” Angelo said. “Those seven or eight hours out of the day, it was peaceful and it was freedom.”\nAngelo is one of the top graduates at Venture Academy with a 3.45 GPA. His future is filled with possibilities, including serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, cutting hair like his uncle or teaching.\n“I am probably one of the first ones in my family to graduate from high school,” Angelo said. “I want to join the Marines right away after graduation and I am thinking about college after that. Teachers have had a big impact on me.”\nAngelo started at Coeur d’Alene High School but transferred to Venture Academy in December of his freshman year.\n“CHS wasn’t a good fit for me,” Angelo said. “I came to Venture and it was the best decision I ever made in my life.”\nThe journey at Venture had its ups and downs, and Angelo’s transformation into a top student took four years to achieve. Angelo said Venture’s staff and teachers gave him grace and guidance.\n“This school has shaped me into the man I am today,” he said. “The teachers at Venture have always been there for me. I love this school.”\nMath is Angelo’s favorite subject due in large part to his teacher, Carlos Gonzales, who inspired him to think differently about math and life.\n“Gonzales gave me the power to be able to problem-solve on my own,” Angelo said. “It challenged me to find solutions. He made me find the answers instead of just telling me.”\nAnother instrumental teacher for Angelo was Lex Levy, an English teacher.\n“I look at him like a father figure,\" Angelo said. \"I write an essay, and he’ll give me 60 different things to fix and I have to rewrite it four times. He knows what I am capable of and he pushed me to do better.”\n• • •\nMarc Stewart is with the Coeur d'Alene School District.",

    "text": "MI thrash RCB by seven wickets to register second win in IPL Mumbai: Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan provided the fireworks with the bat after Jasprit Bumrah’s magical five-wicket haul as Mumbai Indians pummelled Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets for their second win in the IPL here on Thursday. Kishan went ballistic to make 69 off just 34 balls (7x4s, 5x6s) and Suryakumar dazzled with a 19-ball 52 with four sixes and five fours, as Mumbai Indians overhauled RCB’s 197-run target in just 15.3 overs. RCB huffed and puffed but put up a challenging 196/8 courtesy skipper Faf du Plessis (61), Rajat Patidar (50) and Dinesh Karthik’s 23-ball 53 not out but the total proved to be far from enough. The tone for an aggressive reply on a placid deck was set by Kishan, who tore into Mohammed Siraj to collect 23 runs off the India pacer’s second over, hammering him for three sixes and a four. The onslaught continued when RCB introduced Glenn Maxwell in the sixth over, with the MI opener swatting two fours and a six to race to his first fifty of the season off only 23 balls. Kishan once again forged a vital stand for Mumbai in company of Rohit Sharma, with the pair putting on 101 runs off 53 balls for the first wicket. While Rohit (38 off 24 balls, 3x4s, 3x6s) played second fiddle to both Kishan and Suryakumar, the former MI skipper also dished out some spectacular shots before he fell to a stunning one-handed diving catch at short fine leg from Reece Topley off debutant Will Jacks. Suryakumar, who was dropped by Glenn Maxwell at backward point on 15, went after Akash Deep in the 11th over to collect 24 runs with three sixes and one four. Playing only his second game after comeback from injury, Suryakumar was aided by wayward RCB bowlers who presented him plenty of deliveries to knock himself into form and the world No 1 T20 batter obliged with a 17-ball fifty. The contest, which saw partisan crowds cheering loudly for both India stars Rohit and Virat Kohli, also witnessed booing of MI skipper Pandya intermittently. As he walked out to bat, Pandya was hit by loud boos but a section also began chanting ‘Hardik… Hardik’ with Kohli immediately encouraging the fans to cheer for the India all-rounder. Hardik made it harder for the fans to boo him by smashing three sixes in his 6-ball 21 not out. Earlier, Bumrah weaved his magic en route to a five-wicket haul before Karthik played a blinder in the death overs to take RCB close to 200. In a contest where his fellow pacers erred consistently, Bumrah’s accuracy and mastery over variation helped him rule the roost once again. Mixing up his fiery yorkers perfectly with sharp bouncers, Bumrah snaffled the in-form Kohli (3) early on to extend his ordinary run at this venue in the IPL. Du Plessis and Patidar banished their poor run with their respective half-centuries while putting on 82 runs for the third wicket, but Bumrah, who bowled three overs post the halfway mark, seemed to have broken the back of RCB’s resistance with a terrific spell. Karthik, who took a liking for Akash Madhwal (1/57) to collect 38 runs off his two overs, finished with five fours and four sixes. A little tentative at start, Patidar grew in confidence for his first fifty of the season to finish at 50 from 26 balls with three fours and four sixes, while du Plessis got his 61 from 40 balls, studded with four fours and three sixes.",

    "text": "Environment\nTobago oil spill under control, says Emergency Management Agency\nSan Juan, Feb 15 (EFE).- The director of the Tobago Emergency Management Agency, Allan Stewart, said that his agency is “in command and control” of the oil spill caused a week ago by an overturned vessel off the southwest coast of Tobago.\nAccording to Trinidad and Tobago’s Ministry of National Security, at least two vessels, a Panamanian tug and a Guyana-bound barge, were involved in the spill.\n“We have this under control and we will come out shining where this matter is concerned,” Stewart told a news conference at the Scarborough wharf on Wednesday.\nAuthorities have fenced off the area heavily affected by the spill, which was caused by an abandoned ship more than a week ago, but was not disclosed until Sunday.\nAlthough the crude oil has blackened part of the west coast, Tobago’s most popular beaches have not been affected, said Tobago House of Assembly chief clerk Farley Augustine.\n“It is only a radius of 15 kilometers but the vast majority of our beaches, especially the ones you love, the vast majority of our reef systems, they all remain in pristine condition and Tobago is here welcoming you,” he said.\nAugustine said some of the oil from the affected areas had traveled more than 88 kilometers outside Tobago’s waters.\nA team of oil spill response experts arrived on the island on Monday to conduct quality control and analyze the impact on species.\n“We have a team that is working 24/7 looking at wildlife species and the impact on wildlife species and they essentially are extracting species that might be at risk, that might have come into contact with the hydrocarbons” the chief clerk added.\nSeveral areas in Lambeau and Canoe Bay have been cordoned off for the safety of the public and fishermen have been advised not to fish there.\nPrime Minister Keith Rowley called the spill a “national emergency” on Sunday.

    "title": "Philadelphia school district opts out of new state grant for special education teachers - Chalkbeat",
    "text": "Sign up for Chalkbeat Philadelphia’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system.\nA new $1.5 million state grant offered school districts and universities across Pennsylvania a chance for funding to grow their special education workforce. But, despite a dire special education teaching shortage, the Philadelphia school district chose not to apply.\nThe Developing Future Special Educators Grant, awarded by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, provides school districts and universities with up to $20,000 over a two-year period to establish “experiential learning” programs for high school and college students interested in pursuing a career in special education.\nOverall, 77 districts, charter schools, and universities will receive the funds including Pittsburgh public schools, but the only Philadelphia schools on the list are Lindley Academy Charter School and several private universities: Saint Joseph’s University, Chestnut Hill College, Holy Family University, and Eastern University, which has a campus in Philadelphia.\nThe Philadelphia school district said because the grant amounts were relatively small, it is instead focusing on applying for larger grants dedicated to improving its aging buildings.\n“It seems like a grant geared more for smaller [local education agencies],” Monique Braxton, a spokesperson for the school district, said in an email to Chalkbeat. “When this grant application was due, we were very busy with applying for much larger grants from the state for facilities upgrades.”\nThe quality of the district’s schools has been in the news for the last few months following student protests for better facilities and school closures related to the lack of air conditioning.\nEducators say the ongoing teacher shortage is putting a strain on existing classroom teachers and school staff, resulting in larger class sizes and heavier workloads.\nTatyana Williamson, a special education teacher at Frankford High School, had to take over a science course after a teacher left in the middle of the year. Retention rates are so bad that Williamson says she waits until November to gauge if a teacher is leaving or staying.\nOften, Williamson said, kids will ask, “Miss, are you going to be here next year?”\nRecruiting and retaining teachers has been a struggle in Philadelphia. Teacher attrition rates in the city have skyrocketed since 2018. In 2022, 13% of traditional public school teachers and 23% of charter school teachers left the classroom, according to research by Ed Fuller at Penn State’s Center for Evaluation and Education Policy Analysis. Some of the shortage stems from a lack of preparedness, low salaries, inadequate support, and more.\nAs a result, many schools in predominantly black neighborhoods have a high influx of inexperienced teachers and emergency certified teachers.\n“We desperately need all teachers,” said Nicole Wyglendowski, a learning support teacher in North Philadelphia. “I’m wondering why when presented with solutions and money which is what we need more than anything is the funding why aren’t we helping ourselves. Why aren’t we taking the opportunity to help ourselves when we have such a big need?”\nIn June, the district had around 450 open teaching positions, with special education producing the highest vacancy at 150 open positions. Over the past few weeks, the school district has boasted about filling 95% of its teaching positions, but a spokesperson for the district did not immediately respond to Chalkbeat’s questions about how many, if any, of the 150 special education spots have been filled.\nMore than 400 open positions will mean thousands of students will start the school year without a full-time certified teacher.\nPhiladelphia has been trying to combat its teacher retention problems for some time – developing a pipeline for paraprofessionals to get their certification to become full-time teachers, offering student teachers stipends , and more.\nIn addition, the district has held hiring fairs all summer to bring in new teachers, sometimes offering interviews on the spot.\nMany teachers say these attempts are futile without increasing the pay.\n“There’s a lack of respect for the profession and it’s shown by the need to increase salaries. They need to give them more support in the schools themselves,” said Arthur Steinberg, president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.\nIn February, the Board of Education ratified an agreement between the union and the district that gave a 5% pay raise for teachers that will take effect in September. For teachers at the beginning of the pay scale, this increase can feel small.\nPay for a full-time special education teacher in Philadelphia starts at $52,516 — a 5% raise would equate to roughly $55,000. With the rising costs of living, many say it isn’t enough.\nWyglendowski has been asking for donations on social media to pay for supplies for her classroom. And she’s not the only one. Teachers around the country have started asking their followers to contribute to their Amazon wishlists and or donations.\n“It shouldn’t rely on what kind of community resources that you have to see whether or not your kids get the resources they need,” said Wyglendowski. “Sometimes it’ll be mid-year and I’ll have to do another fundraiser because I’m like ‘guys we run out of pencils, I got no erasers, like I have a kid who needs uniforms … it’s crazy that I have to rely on that.”\nAzia Ross is a summer intern for Chalkbeat Philadelphia.
