    "text": "Milwaukee County bus driver rescues child from busy intersection MILWAUKEE COUNTY, Wis. (CBS 58) -- A Milwaukee County bus operator went above and beyond the call of duty last month. The driver help save a small boy from one of Milwaukee’s busiest streets. For Milwaukee County bus operator Keyon Finkley, a Saturday afternoon in late February was shaping up to be an average day. \"Normal day for me. Sunny, a little chilly, the weather wasn’t my friend that day,\" said Finkley. Finkley was on his Red Line route, driving down Capitol on Milwaukee's north side, when he saw something he hasn’t seen before in his four years behind the wheel. \"Seeing that boy on that street, on Capitol Drive, knowing how busy and dangerous it is, sent a chill in my spine and got me scared,\" said Finkley. The father of four said he jumped into one mode he knows best. \"Daddy mode -- it wasn’t no second thought to do anything but jump into daddy mode and protect that boy like he was my son, and to make sure he was okay. Everything else, I ain't care about,\" said Finkley. Bus surveillance showed Finkley pulling over and rescuing the small child from the busy intersection. \"Even now, me talking about the story, I get a little emotional, because it's a scary situation that could have been something that turned bad,\" said Finkley. Finkley said all his life he's struggled with his speech, making him shy, but his heroic moves prove sometimes actions can speak louder than words. \"For me, it was just making sure he was safe; that's all I was worried about that day, that’s all I was thinking about,\" said Finkley. The boy was reconnected with his family shortly after Finkley found him. According to MCTS, this little boy was the 14th missing child a MCTS bus driver has found in recent years.",

    "text": "'Sanskrit Going Extinct, Only Census Can Save It!': Truth Behind Viral Claim | Fact Check\nSocial media warns Sanskrit faces extinction without census support. But with ongoing use in rituals and education, the language remains alive and actively preserved\nA message circulating on social media warns of the possible extinction of the Sanskrit language, urging citizens to declare Sanskrit as their first language in the upcoming national census. The claim suggests that failure to do so may result in Sanskrit being labelled as ‘extinct’, which could subsequently lead to the withdrawal of government grants, educational assistance, and preservation efforts.\nWhile it is accurate that Sanskrit is spoken by a relatively small number of people today, this limited usage does not imply the language is extinct.\nRecommended Stories\nThe Census Push\nSocial media posts claim that the census will be concluded by March 2027, and encourage people to select ‘Sanskrit’ when asked about their mother tongue and languages known. Although Sanskrit is not widely spoken in everyday conversation, it is still regularly used in daily worship, chanting, the recitation of shlokas, and during religious rituals.\nAccording to the 2011 Census of India, 24,821 people reported Sanskrit as their first language, a significant rise from 14,135 in the 2001 census. In certain villages such as Dimmar in Uttarakhand, Mattur in Karnataka, and Jhiri in Madhya Pradesh, Sanskrit remains in active daily use.\nHow Is Sanskrit Being Preserved And Supported?\nSanskrit, regarded as India’s oldest and original language, holds deep cultural and religious significance. Various efforts continue to support its preservation. Numerous universities across India and abroad offer courses in Sanskrit, and some Indian states include the language as a compulsory or optional subject in schools.\nEducational institutions like Utkal University and the National Sanskrit University are dedicated to the teaching and research of Sanskrit. Furthermore, government bodies, including the Ministry of Education, have specific budget allocations for Sanskrit’s promotion, and separate grants are provided to institutions engaged in its study and preservation.\nCensus And Language Policy: Understanding The Link\nThe census is a key instrument in collecting data related to population, socio-economic indicators, education levels, and languages spoken. This information assists in the creation of government policies and development plans. Data concerning the number of speakers of a language can help indicate whether targeted support or special schemes are necessary for its preservation.\nHowever, government grants and support for a language are not determined solely by the number of speakers. Factors such as a language’s historical, cultural, and constitutional status also play a significant role. Sanskrit, for instance, is included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which formally recognises its official importance.\nWhat Constitutes Language Extinction? A Closer Look\nThe decision to classify a language as ‘extinct’ is not made lightly. It involves defined criteria established by international organisations such as UNESCO. A language is considered extinct when no person speaks it as their mother tongue and no younger generation is learning it.\nWhile several Indian languages are indeed endangered and at risk of extinction, the suggestion that Sanskrit will lose government support unless listed as a first language in the census is inaccurate and overstated.\nSanskrit’s Enduring Significance And Future Outlook\nDespite a decline in its everyday use, Sanskrit continues to be preserved through religious, educational, and scholarly practices. The language’s historical, cultural, and religious value ensures that it remains eligible for ongoing government and institutional support, backed by dedicated budget allocations and national recognition.\nIn conclusion, while raising awareness about Sanskrit’s role and encouraging its learning is important, the claim that it faces extinction or funding loss unless declared as a first language in the census lacks factual basis. The language remains a living cultural treasure, supported by a broad network of public and academic institutions.\nMovies, Breaking News On\nIndia,\nWorld, Live\nCricketScores, And\nStock Market Updates.

Help Now >\nPhoto credit: Liv Bruce\nHighlights\n[Deacon Keith Fournier, JD, MTS, MPhil.](/search/?q=Deacon+Keith+Fournier%2C+JD%2C+MTS%2C+MPhil.)\n12/28/2023 (1 hour ago)\nPublished in\n[Marriage & Family](/news/hf/family/)\nKeywords:\n[Feast](/search/?q=Feast), [Holy Innocents](/search/?q=Holy+Innocents), [no](/search/?q=no), [legal](/search/?q=legal), [abortion](/search/?q=abortion)\nThe first reading is taken from the 1st letter of the beloved disciple John. John reminds us: \"This is the message that we have heard from Jesus Christ and proclaim to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say, \"We have fellowship with him,\" while we continue to walk in darkness, we lie and do not act in truth.\" (I John 5)\nWhen we read these words how can we not think of those in public office in the United States of America who, though insisting that they are doing good by providing health care for those who cannot afford it, want to use Federal funds to kill the new holy innocents? No matter how many times some elected representatives tried to prevent it, the Obama Administration seemed hell-bent on doing this.\nThe Trump Administration seemed much more inclined to defending innocent human life in the womb. And President Trumps appointments to the Courts helped bring about the Dobbs Decision and the overturning of Roe v Wade. But, the battle now continues in every State. And, the Biden administration has followed the same evil approach as the Obama Administration.\nMany who advocate for taking the lives of children in the womb with tax dollars wish that people like me would just be quiet! I assure you; we will never do so. Every procured abortion takes an innocent human life. Over the years, I have received E mails and letters from those who maintain that my insistence on protecting these children is somehow \"narrow minded\", or \"fundamentalist\" or that I am \"right wing\".\nSome accuse me of opposing health care for the poor. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I have regularly maintained that there are good people on all sides of the discussion as to how the delivery of health services can best be provided. Most agree that we do need real health care reform in the United States. The only question is how best to achieve the goal. But, taking the lives of these \"holy innocents\" in the first home of the whole human race, their motherâ€ s womb, is not health care.\nI do not care how many derogatory slurs they throw at me. Killing children in the womb now is as evil as it was in the days of Herod. As for my politics, I am pro-life, pro-poor (does not mean big government), pro-peace (non-interventionist), pro-freedom and pro-family.\nI will never support any public policy or legislation which calls the killing of innocent children a choice and protects such an evil act with the Police Power of the State. Jesus Christ was a child in the womb. Every child in the womb is not only a human person but he or she is also our neighbor. It is always and everywhere wrong to kill our innocent neighbors.\nMedical science has confirmed what the Natural Law and our conscience long ago told all of us, the child in the womb is one of us. We now routinely operate on her when she needs our help and place her back in her first home until birth. We prosecute a criminal who, in committing a crime against her mother, kills her as well.\nThe lie of what is wrongly called the \"pro-choice\" position has been revealed in its wretched ugliness. No-one who continues to profess it is a friend of the poor. The little baby in the womb is, as Mother Teresa so clearly reminded us, the \"poorest of the poor\". The child has no choice.\nThe continual efforts to label people like me who are simply trying to be consistent in our defense of all human life, from conception to natural death, as narrow minded, or right wing or whatever other epitaph can be thrown against us, calls to mind the old childhood response \"sticks and stones may break my bones bit names will never hurt me!\"\nThe Gospel for the Liturgy on the Feast of the Holy Innocents reminds us of how evil can infect those who fail to hear the cry of the poor in government. The example given is Herod, a ruler inebriated with his own power. He ruled unjustly while claiming to be doing exactly the opposite:\n\"When Herod realized that he had been deceived by the magi, he became furious. He ordered the massacre of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had ascertained from the magi. Then was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah the prophet: A voice was heard in Ramah, sobbing and loud lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be consoled, since they were no more\"\nRachel still weeps in our day.\nThe Office of Readings in the Liturgy of the Hours offers the sermon of St Quodvultdeus, a deacon and Church father of the 5th century, entitled \"Even before they learn to speak, they proclaim Christ\": \"A tiny child is born, who is a great king. Wise men are led to him from afar. They come to adore one who lies in a manger and yet reigns in heaven and on earth. When they tell of one who is born a king, Herod is disturbed. To save his kingdom he resolves to kill him, though if he would have faith in the child, he himself would reign in peace in this life and for ever in the life to come.\n2023 is almost over, and we still need your support. <a href=\"https://ycvf.org/products/donate?utm_campaign=Catholic%20Online%20Ads&utm_source=ROS&utm_medium=2023AlmostOver\">\nThis Christmas Season, we humbly ask you to join the 1% of readers who give.

He does not come to drive you out, but to conquer the devil. But because you do not understand this you are disturbed and in a rage, and to destroy one child whom you seek, you show your cruelty in the death of so many children.\n\"You are not restrained by the love of weeping mothers or fathers mourning the deaths of their sons, nor by the cries and sobs of the children. You destroy those who are tiny in body because fear is destroying your heart. You imagine that if you accomplish your desire you can prolong your own life, though you are seeking to kill Life himself.\n\"Yet your throne is threatened by the source of grace, so small, yet so great, who is lying in the manger. He is using you, all unaware of it, to work out his own purposes freeing souls from captivity to the devil. He has taken up the sons of the enemy into the ranks of God's adopted children.\n\"The children die for Christ, though they do not know it. The parents mourn for the death of martyrs. The child makes of those as yet unable to speak fit witnesses to himself. See the kind of kingdom that is his, coming as he did in order to be this kind of king. See how the deliverer is already working deliverance, the savior already working salvation.\n\"But you, Herod, do not know this and are disturbed and furious. While you vent your fury against the child, you are already paying him homage, and do not know it.\n\"How great a gift of grace is here! To what merits of their own do the children owe this kind of victory? They cannot speak, yet they bear witness to Christ. They cannot use their limbs to engage in battle, yet already they bear off the palm of victory.\"\nEvery child killed by voluntary abortion in our own age is a \"Holy Innocent\". Every politician who supports this killing, implicitly or explicitly, carries on the evil act of Herod.\nOn this Feast of the Holy Innocents let us rise up with new resolve and demand that abortion is not health care. Rather, it is a barbaric practice masquerading as \"freedom\" in an age which is quickly losing its soul.\nHi readers, it seems you use Catholic Online a lot; that's great!

    "text": "Tired of Waking Up Groggy? This Natural Supplement Could Enhance Your Sleep Routine Melatonin is not always the solution for everyone. Luckily, there are other effective sleep aids on the market to try. Sleep is essential to all aspects of our well-being, from our [mood](/health/mental/want-to-be-happier-get-more-sleep-6-ways-your-sleep-influences-mental-health/) and brain functions to [our immune system](/health/strengthen-your-immune-system-with-these-expert-backed-tips/), heart health and more. Despite how important a good night's sleep is, many Americans [struggle with insomnia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12119-insomnia). If you've tried [nighttime yoga](/health/sleep/8-easy-yoga-poses-to-do-at-bedtime-for-better-sleep/), [journaling](https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/6-habits-for-better-sleep/), melatonin and [every other sleep remedy in the book,](/health/sleep/how-to-get-better-sleep-this-year/) and you still can't seem to knock out at night, there's a supplement you might consider trying. Enter gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA. It's an amino acid, naturally found in the body, that promotes a calming effect. GABA is often taken as a dietary supplement, but it has a track record showing that it may be a good sleep aid alternative to melatonin. It affects only the early sleep stages and leaves you feeling more awake in the morning as a result (some people say popular sleep supplements like [melatonin make them groggy](/health/sleep/melatonin-can-make-you-groggy-3-alternative-sleep-supplements-to-try-instead/)). Although there's limited research, the small studies performed yield positive results that show GABA may be worth a try if you're unable to fall asleep. Here's what we know about GABA, tips on taking it and why it might be a viable sleep aid to consider. For more help getting quality rest, try these [seven natural sleep aids for insomnia](/health/sleep/7-natural-sleep-aids-for-insomnia/), and here's how to [create the perfect environment for sleep](/health/sleep/how-to-create-the-perfect-environment-for-better-sleep/). What is GABA? [GABA is a neurotransmitter](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22857-gamma-aminobutyric-acid-gaba) naturally found in the brain and some foods like tomatoes and soybeans. It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter that blocks chemical signals in the central nervous system and reduces brain activity. GABA can help promote calmness in the body and helps regulate nerve cell hyperactivity when feeling fearful, anxious or stressed. It's sold without a prescription as a dietary supplement, but GABA's effects may also benefit those who struggle to fall asleep. Taking GABA for sleep Taken alone or with other natural sleep aids, GABA supplements help address [anxiety, stress and an overactive brain](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-aids/gaba-for-sleep), three main offenders that make it difficult to fall asleep. Its calming effect puts the mind in a relaxed state, so you're in the right headspace to drift off to sleep. Low GABA levels have actually been linked to sleep deprivation, as [one study](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncpneuro0992) found participants with insomnia had 30% lower levels of GABA in their systems. Another [small-scale study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7527439/) by Frontiers in Neuroscience involving middle-aged adults found that taking 300 mg of GABA before bed for at least a week can reduce sleep latency (the amount of time it takes to fall asleep). There's no concrete evidence showing GABA helps sleep efficiency (quality of sleep and slow wave sleep), but the study's results showed it may promote sleepiness as it affects early sleep stages. Another benefit is that it won't leave you feeling [drowsy the following morning](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep/zzzquil-side-effects) like other over-the-counter medications such as ZzzQuil or prescription sleep medications. Tips for taking GABA to aid sleep 1. GABA can be taken as a supplement or powder in your food. 2. Take GABA 30 to 60 minutes before bed for the best results (as shown by studies). 3. Follow the dosage instructions and track the amount and how often you take GABA. 4. Use a sleep journal to document your sleep quality so you can identify patterns and possible side effects while tracking GABA's effectiveness. 5. GABA is naturally found in fermented foods like kimchi, sourdough, sake and mulberry beer. 6. Always talk to your doctor before taking GABA or any new supplements. Is it safe to take GABA every night? According to the Sleep Foundation, there are no serious side effects when taking GABA in small doses from sleep or dietary supplements, although some consumers have reported feeling abdominal pain or headaches. High levels of GABA in the brain are linked to daytime drowsiness, and a small number of people report drowsiness after taking GABA. People at a higher risk of having a negative reaction to GABA include: - Pregnant women - Individuals under 18 years old - Those who take prescriptions for high blood pressure - Those who take anti-seizure medications Other benefits of GABA: stress and anxiety relief While research is still limited, more data supporting GABA as a [stress and anxiety](/health/mental/best-teas-for-anxiety-and-stress/) reliever continues to emerge. Relieving anxiety and stress before bed isn't to be taken lightly, as it can significantly impact [sleep latency and overall sleep quality](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/sleepless-nights-try-stress-relief-techniques). [One study from 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00726-011-1206-6)showed that after 30 minutes of taking GABA, it helped ease stress in participants. - Low levels of GABA can result in [anxiety and depression](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-gaba#1)and are prevalent in individuals with [mental health conditions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22857-gamma-aminobutyric-acid-gaba). - There's a high dose of GABA in the supplement Chlorella as the neurotransmitter has been shown to [lower blood pressure](https://thesleepdoctor.com/sleep-aids/gaba/). As you should with any new supplement, consult your doctor before taking GABA, especially when taken in combination with other medications or prescriptions.",

    "text": "New Delhi, July 10 (IANS) The Ministry of Home Affairs on Thursday approved the release of Rs 1,066.80 crore to flood and landslide-hit six states - Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Kerala and Uttarakhand.\nAmong the six flood affected states, Assam received Rs 375.60 crore, Rs 29.20 crore was given to Manipur, Rs 30.40 crore to Meghalaya, Rs 22.80 crore to Mizoram, Rs 153.20 crore to Kerala, and Rs 455.60 crore to Uttarakhand, as Central share from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), said a Ministry statement.\nThese states have been affected due to extremely heavy rainfall, floods and landslides during the south-west monsoon, it said.\nIn a message on X, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, \"More than Rs 8,000 crore from SDRF/NDRF funds has been provided to 19 states this year. Apart from financial aid, providing all logistic assistance, including deployment of requisite NDRF, Army, and Air Force, has been our priority.\"\nEarlier, Amit Shah said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government is fully committed to providing all possible assistance to flood, landslide and cloudburst-affected states.\nThis year, the Centre has already released Rs 6,166.00 crore from SDRF to 14 states and Rs 1,988.91 crore from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) to 12 states.\nIn addition, Rs 726.20 crore released from the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF) to five states and Rs 17.55 crore from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) have also been released to two states, said the statement.\nThe Central government has also provided all logistics assistance, including deployment of requisite NDRF teams, Army teams and Air Force support to all the flood, landslide, and cloudburst-affected states.\nDuring the ongoing monsoon, 104 teams of NDRF are deployed in 21 States/UT for rescue and relief operations.\nThe Indian Army has launched extensive Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations under 'Operation Jal Rahat 2', with coordinated deployment across Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur.\nOn Thursday, the Deputy Commissioner of Dimapur formally requisitioned assistance from the Army to provide immediate flood relief in Singrijan Colony, one of the worst-hit areas.\nIn Upper Assam, the Dhansiri River in Golaghat district has breached danger levels. Although water levels are now receding, the Army continues to monitor the situation closely and is ready to intervene should the need arise.\nIn Manipur, the Nambol River flowing through Imphal West and Bishnupur districts has also surpassed danger levels. While floodwaters are beginning to recede, the Army remains actively engaged in relief operations in coordination with civil authorities, said the statement.\nDisclaimer: This story has not been edited by the Sakshi Post team and is auto-generated from syndicated feed.",
