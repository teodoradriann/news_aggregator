    "text": "Nebraska experiencing one of the worst flu seasons as cases continue to climb\nBy Jolie Peal , Reporter Nebraska Public Media News\nFeb. 20, 2025, 4 p.m. ·\nListen To This Story\nMore than 15,000 influenza cases have been reported this flu season, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Influenza A is the main strain taking over the state this year, with more than 14,000 cases.\nNumbers are still climbing, and several state health officials said it's unusual for peak flu numbers to arrive so late in the season.\n“We’re still peaking as for the cases in Nebraska and in the U.S.,” Dr. Renuga Vivekanandan, an infectious disease physician and Chief Medical Officer for CHI said. “I would say we’re still going to expect more cases middle of March, end of March, and then it slowly should taper off.”\nVivekanandan recommends those with symptoms — like runny nose and a fever — talk to their primary care provider about getting tested or take an at-home test.\nNebraskans can also take preventative measures to protect against catching the flu or other illnesses. Molly Herman, epidemiology manager at the Northeast Nebraska Public Health Department, said it’s never too late to get vaccinated for the flu or other respiratory illnesses like COVID.\n“Since Nebraskans care about their communities, something they can do that's really quick and relatively easy is get that flu shot or COVID shot,” Herman said. “You're going to need to reduce the risk of getting grandma sick, which could end up being a catastrophic illness for grandma.”\nHerman said local health departments can connect those looking to get vaccinated with places that can do it for free.\nThe cold weather is one factor causing higher amounts of cases because people are indoors more and, Herman said, the low temperatures keep germs alive.\n“For example, if someone coughs into their hand and then uses that hand to open a door outside, it's possible that the flu virus could hang out on that door handle longer during cold times than in the middle of summer,” she said.\nHerman and Vivekanandan both recommended eating healthy, staying hydrated and washing hands to keep from getting sick. Herman also said people can make a homemade air purifier with a box fan and furnace filter to help stop the spread of germs.",

    "text": "Husker team receives $5M grant to reduce methane emissions from cattle By Eric Buck University of Nebraska-Lincoln A Husker research team has received $5 million from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) to research more sustainable dairy and beef production. The research team is composed of [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/) faculty members from the Department of Animal Science and Department of Biological Systems Engineering, along with researchers from the [U.S. Meat Animal Research Center ](https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/clay-center-ne/marc/)in Clay Center, Nebraska. The team will study the interrelationships among animal genetics, the gut microbiome and nutrition, with the ultimate goal of developing tools and management practices that can lower methane emissions from livestock. The funding, which is through the USDA’s [National Institute of Food and Agriculture](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/), is part of the U.S. government’s $10 million investment toward projects reducing intestinal methane emissions from ruminant animals. The response aligns with President Joe Biden’s Global Methane Pledge made in September 2021. The project is led by Paul Kononoff, along with fellow Husker faculty Samodha Fernando, Matt Spangler, Galen Erickson, Jessica Sperber, Richard Stowell and Tammy Brown-Brandl. Additional researchers include James Wells and Bryan Neville from the Meat Animal Research Center. Ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep and goats have a digestive system containing microbes that break down plant materials and feed byproducts through fermentation. This process supplies vital nutrients to the animal while converting plants and other materials that humans are unable to digest into an important protein source. However, a byproduct of rumen fermentation is the creation of methane, a greenhouse gas. Cattle may produce between 200 and 500 liters of methane daily. Once produced, methane is then belched into the environment. The volume produced highly depends on an animal’s size and the feed consumed, as well as on its genetics and unique gut microbiome. “We’re developing a better understanding of the role of animal genetics and gut microbiome on not only methane production, but energy use and feed efficiency,” Kononoff said. Kononoff and his team will also investigate ways to establish a healthy microbiome in young animals that supports normal growth and production while reducing the amount of methane an individual animal produces. “This work will ensure that young animals get off to an even better start in life,” he said. The research results will be used to develop new tools and practices for producers to continue producing food while reducing methane production from the animals that they care for. It will also help producers make better breeding decisions and improve feed efficiency for their animals. These science-based solutions will be delivered to producers through university extension programs, aiding in the profitability and sustainability of family dairy and beef operations. “This is innovative, high-impact research that is going to point us in a direction where we will have a better understanding of the interconnected factors that impact methane production in cattle and build a more comprehensive understanding of cattle nutrition and performance,” said Derek McLean, dean and director of the Agricultural Research Division at Nebraska. Ultimately, Kononoff hopes the research improves efficiency and profitability for livestock producers, too. “Beef and dairy products are some of the most healthy, nutrient-dense and best-tasting foods we can enjoy,” he said. “This research should further support the many sustainable practices that beef and dairy producers currently employ in delivering food to consumers, opening new doors so that this food is produced in a manner that lessens the effect on the climate and Earth we all live on.”",

    "title": "Shakur Stevenson says ‘young black guys’ are held to a different standard when it comes to entertaining in the ring - Boxing News",
    "text": "If anybody was going to understand the frustration of Shakur Stevenson in the aftermath of his much-maligned WBC lightweight title defense against Artem Harutyunyan in July, it was always going to be Andre Ward. Aside from the fact Stevenson considers Ward one of his mentors, there is also a clear parallel between the two in terms of how the ease with which they beat opponents leaves them susceptible to being labelled “boring” by those who like to see their boxers have to work a little harder for their wins. For some, seeing Stevenson cruise to victory and elect not to risk defeat in order to secure a more complete victory – say, a stoppage – has become a habit and pattern they wish he would break. Similarly, Ward, back when cleaning up at both super-middleweight and light-heavyweight, would often face criticism for the way in which he would shut down opponents, take away their best weapons, and then do all he could to ensure his own safety, only too aware of the dangers of becoming greedy in a fight. If considered a mentor, it should come as no surprise, then, that Stevenson, like Ward, values his faculties and priorities winning over everything else. Cut from the same cloth, he again demonstrated this philosophy in his fight with Harutyunyan and says, given the circumstances, the performance made sense – at least to him. Speaking to Ward on “All the Smoke Fight”, Stevenson explained, “I haven’t been outside the ring that long in my entire career. It was nine or 10 months. The first round was getting back in that rhythm, like okay, I’m back. Now in the third round I’m feeling it; I started touching the body a little bit more. Then I tried to pick up the pace and I had it going. There was a moment where I felt like I had it, it was right there. But I kind of let it get away. I felt like it was going to happen, and I felt like he was breaking down, but at the end of the day these fighters are training extremely hard and come fight night they’re going to give it all they’ve got. He gave it all he had and he did what he could to make sure he stayed on his feet. I take my hat off to him.” Though he won the fight well, landing a decision by scores of 116-112, 118-110, and 119-109, the reaction to Stevenson’s 22nd pro win had it feeling more like a defeat than a victory. The manner of it was clearly not to everyone’s taste and no sooner had he realized this than Stevenson started to wonder about the true meaning of victory and whether it is enough, today, just to win. “Did you feel like it was warranted (the post-fight reaction), or do you feel like people are tripping?” asked Ward, to which Stevenson, 22-0 (10), replied: “I felt like people were tripping. I mean, I would get it if this applied to everybody. If those standards applied to the (Vasiliy) Lomachenkos, the (Oleksandr) Usyks… I’ve seen them in fights where I didn’t feel it was very entertaining. But a lot of people don’t do to them what they do to somebody like me. When I’m in a fight where I’m dominating, pressing, coming forward, they still find something to say. But if it’s Lomachenko… I don’t hear nobody ever say Lomachenko was being boring when he fought (Jose) Pedraza. I didn’t hear anything about him being boring when he fought (Guillermo) Rigondeaux. He barely even touched Rigondeaux. He barely landed any punches on Rigondeaux, but nobody claims he was boring. He was coming forward and making a fight, but I just feel like it’s a different standard on young black guys. I feel like our people need to like learn how to stand with us, not play against us. Because we’re playing right into other people’s hands – no disrespect to nobody else.”",

    "text": "Los fuertes vientos, las mañanas nubosas y la persistencia de brillo solar son cambios bruscos de temperatura que vienen generando la incidencia de enfermedades respiratorias y otras propias de la temporada de otoño-invierno, que afectan sobre todo a los más pequeños.\nSegún la Dra. Lenka Kolevic Roca, jefa del Servicio de Infectología del Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño (INSN) Breña, este incremento de la incidencia se produce por múltiples factores, entre los que figura el contagio que se produce en cunas jardines y colegios, donde los menores pasan mucho tiempo en espacios cerrados, lo que favorece la dispersión de ciertos virus y aumenta las probabilidades de contagio.\nEl INSN Breña realizó un listado con las enfermedades más comunes en la infancia a causa del cambio de clima, para conocerlas, saber cómo actuar para minimizar sus síntomas y evitar su contagio en la medida de lo posible pues la presencia de algunos gérmenes podría producir trastornos respiratorios muy leves hasta con mayor complicación.\nResfriado común\nCausado por virus y se caracteriza por presentar secreción nasal, estornudos, tos o dolor de cabeza. Dura alrededor de 1 a 4 días.\nGripe\nPresenta los síntomas de un resfriado común y se incluyen fiebre alta, malestar muscular por lo que, su recuperación puede tomar más tiempo.\nVirus respiratorio sincitial (VRS)\nLas personas con una infección por virus respiratorio sincitial son contagiosas durante 3 a 8 días. Pero a veces los bebés y las personas con sistemas inmunitarios debilitados pueden continuar propagando el virus durante 4 semanas.\nLos síntomas son leves parecidos al resfriado, pero puede provocar infecciones pulmonares graves, especialmente en bebés, adultos mayores y personas con problemas médicos serios.\nInfluenza\nEnfermedad respiratoria viral que puede afectar a los niños de manera grave. Los síntomas incluyen fiebre, dolor de cabeza, tos, dolor de garganta, y dolor muscular.\nBronquiolitis\nEs una infección viral respiratoria común. Entre los síntomas encontramos congestión nasal, tos, fiebre de bajo grado y dificultad respiratoria. En otro caso, los menores presentan fiebre, falta de apetito, vómitos y diarrea. Durante los primeros días, los síntomas tienden a empeorar, pero mejoran lentamente con el paso de los días.\nNeumonía\nSi el niño o adolescente tuvo un resfriado por varios días y de pronto presenta fiebre alta y su tos empeora y viene acompañada con flema, podría ser un signo de neumonía por lo que, será mejor una evaluación médica. Suele ser una de las enfermedades graves en niños.\nFaringitis aguda\nEs una infección producida por un virus o bacterias que ocasiona malestar general, fiebre, dolor de garganta.\nAsma bronquial\nTipo de alergia donde el menor tiene dificultad respiratoria y reporta sonido como pitos al toser. Es necesario la atención médico-especializada.\nVaricela\nEs una infección y se presenta con lesiones en la piel como bolitas. Comienza en el cuero cabelludo y en el rostro, luego sigue el tronco y después las extremidades. Para evitar esta enfermedad existe la vacuna que es gratuita.\nTuberculosis\nLos síntomas pueden ser tos seca persistente por más de dos semanas, astenia, anorexia, pérdida de peso, fiebre, sudoración nocturna, entre otros.\nPara prevenir el contagio de estas enfermedades, la Dra. Lenka Kolevic Roca del INSN Breña remarcó la importancia de varias medidas preventivas.\nRecomendaciones\n- Evitar en los niños los cambios bruscos de temperatura.\n- Enseñarles la importancia del lavado de manos. El 80% de las enfermedades virales es por el contacto directo con superficies contaminadas.\n- Evitar exponer a los menores de edad a lugares donde se aglomeren muchas personas y con poca ventilación para evitar que adquieran infecciones virales.\n- Cuidar y tratar los síntomas iniciales de los procesos respiratorios (secreción nasal, tos, fiebre dolor de garganta). Porque un resfrío o gripe pueden complicarse si no son tratados a tiempo, en especial si el niño padece frecuentemente de síntomas alérgicos.\n- Si el niño presenta fiebre alta -más de 38°C- o si luego de un proceso leve de resfrío reaparecen los síntomas luego de 2 o 3 días debe llevarlo a evaluación médica.\n- Ante la tos exigente o agitada, así como la dificultad para dormir, también se debe llevar al niño a un médico.\n- Evitar que el menor enfermo acuda al colegio, y de ser necesaria su presencia lo ideal será que utilice mascarilla para evitar contagio.\n- Enseñar a los menores a cubrirse siempre la boca y la nariz con el brazo (pliegue interno del codo) o con la ayuda de un pañuelo desechable y nunca con la mano, de forma a evitar expandir el virus. Si utiliza pañuelo, debe desecharse inmediatamente a un bote de basura luego de su uso y seguidamente lavarse las manos con agua y jabón.\n- No es recomendable abrigar mucho al menor.\n- Disminuir consumo de tabaco o no esté contacto con el niño. Puede generar bronquiolitis.\n- Alimentación balanceada. Dieta equilibrada. Si es un niño pequeño es la lactancia materna. Alimentos ricos en vitaminas y zinc.",

    "text": "- An act of faith led neighbors to flag a dumpster truck driver down to save a woman calling for help. - Employees in the Shotwell Street shopping center say they heard screaming coming from a dumpster Thursday. - Watch the story to see more first hand footage of the events that led to neighbors, police and first responders saving a woman's life. BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT: [A woman in South Georgia is safe after nearly being crushed in a garbage truck.](https://www.wtxl.com/bainbridge/woman-heard-screaming-inside-garbage-truck-saved-from-being-crushed) WTXL reporter AJ Douglas met some of the quick-thinking neighbors who heard that woman's cries for help. We also checked to see what's being done to make sure it doesn't happen again. Screams for help. That's what Debbie Chavers said she heard Thursday outside Chucks Liquor Store where she works. \"If we hadn't screamed and hollered she might have been squished,” said Debbie Chavers, a cashier at Chuck's Liquor Store. She and other neighbors could hear that woman screaming from inside a dumpster truck. This surveillance video shows employees stopping the driver to alert him that there may be someone inside. \"The dumpster came back in and low and behold there was a lady in there,” Chavers. Bainbridge Public Safety fire and police departments quickly responded to Captain D's parking lot on Shotwell Street after neighbors like Chavers sounded the alarm. \"The hole that she fell in was small. It was so small you can barely get something in there to get her out with,” said Chavers. Chavers said after 45 minutes the woman was rescued and taken to the hospital. Following the rescue, WTXL contacted the City of Bainbridge to see what's being done to prevent this dangerous situation from happening again. In a written statement, the city of Bainbridge said they have plans for additional preventative methods reading in part quote, \"Per our City Engineer, going forward when our sanitation truck drivers approach a dumpster with a closed lid, they will attempt to alert someone by either honking the horn or rattling the dumpster slightly.\" It's a simple step toward a safer community. Preventing the need for rescues like the one Chavers helped start. \"It was awful... I wouldn't want anybody to go through that,” said Chavers. Police are still waiting to talk to the unidentified woman to learn more about the circumstances that put her in a position that could have cost her life.",

    "text": "SAÚDE MENTAL\nCientistas fazem \"mapa do cérebro\" que pode ajudar contra ataques de pânico\nPesquisadores descobrem circuito cerebral associado a episódios espontâneos e incontrolados de medo inexplicável acompanhado de sintomas físicos, como falta de ar e sudorese\nPublicado em: 05/01/2024 18:20\n|Transtorno afeta até 4% da população mundial (foto: Pexels)|\nMedo avassalador, palmas das mãos suadas, falta de ar, batimentos cardíacos acelerados — esses são alguns dos sintomas de um ataque de pânico, que algumas pessoas apresentam com frequência e de forma inesperada. A criação de um mapa das regiões, neurônios e conexões no cérebro que medeiam esses episódios pode fornecer orientação para o desenvolvimento de uma terapêutica mais eficaz para o transtorno, que, segundo a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS), afeta entre 2% e 4% da população global.\nOs pesquisadores do Instituto Salk, na Califórnia, nos Estados Unidos, começaram a construir esse mapa, ao descobrir um importante circuito cerebral para o transtorno do pânico. Essa rede consiste em neurônios especializados que enviam e recebem um neuropeptídeo — uma pequena proteína que manda mensagens por todo o cérebro — chamado Pacap.\nAlém disso, os cientistas determinaram que o Pacap e os neurônios que produzem o seu receptor são possíveis alvos para novos tratamentos para o transtorno do pânico. As descobertas foram publicadas ontem, na revista Nature Neuroscience.\n\"Temos explorado diferentes áreas do cérebro para entender onde começam os ataques de pânico\", diz o autor sênior Sung Han, professor associado do Instituto Salk. Segundo ele, acreditava-se que uma pequena estrutura semelhante a uma amêndoa, a amígdala, conhecida como o centro do medo do cérebro, era a principal responsável. \"Mas mesmo as pessoas que têm danos nessa região ainda podem sofrer ataques de pânico, por isso sabíamos que precisávamos procurar outro lugar\", conta.\nTratamentos\nA descoberta atual de um circuito cerebral específico fora da amígdala que está ligado a ataques de pânico pode inspirar novos tratamentos para o transtorno, que diferem dos medicamentos atuais disponíveis. Esses, normalmente, têm como alvo o sistema de serotonina do cérebro.\nPara começar a esboçar um mapa cerebral do transtorno do pânico, os pesquisadores analisaram uma região do cérebro chamada núcleo parabraquial lateral (NPBL), que fica em uma parte do tronco cerebral, e é conhecida como centro de alarme do órgão. Curiosamente, essa pequena área também controla a respiração, a frequência cardíaca e a temperatura corporal, que ficam alteradas durante os episódios.\nTornou-se evidente que o NPBL estava associado à geração de pânico e na provocação de mudanças emocionais e físicas. Além disso, os pesquisadores descobriram que essa área do cérebro produz o Pacap, proteína conhecida como principal reguladora das respostas ao estresse. Mas a ligação entre esses elementos ainda não era clara, então a equipe recorreu a um modelo animal, para confirmar e expandir o mapa proposto.\n\"No passado, comportamentos emocionais e relacionados ao estresse foram associados a neurônios que expressam o Pacap\", diz o coautor Sukjae Kang, pesquisador associado sênior do laboratório de Han. \"Ao imitar os ataques de pânico nos ratos, fomos capazes de observar a atividade desses neurônios e descobrir uma conexão única entre o circuito cerebral Pacap e o transtorno do pânico.\"\nExpressão\nOs cientistas constataram que, durante um ataque de pânico, os neurônios que expressam a proteína foram ativados. Quando isso acontece, eles liberam o neuropeptídeo mensageiro Pacap para outra parte do cérebro chamada rafe dorsal, onde residem os neurônios que expressam os receptores da proteína. Então, são produzidos os sintomas comportamentais e físicos associados ao transtorno.\nA ligação entre o pânico e o circuito cerebral Pacap foi um passo importante para mapear o cérebro, diz Han. A equipe também descobriu que, ao inibir a sinalização da proteína, é possível reduzir os sintomas, uma descoberta que consideram promissora para o desenvolvimento futuro de terapêutica específica para transtorno.\nDe acordo com Han, apesar da categorização da síndrome do pânico como um transtorno de ansiedade, há muitas maneiras pelas quais as duas condições são diferentes. Por exemplo, a primeira induz a muitos sintomas físicos, como falta de ar, batimentos cardíacos acelerados, sudorese e náusea, mas a segunda não gera esses sinais.\nOutra diferença é que os ataques de pânico são incontroláveis e muitas vezes espontâneos, enquanto outros transtornos de ansiedade, como o de estresse pós-traumático (TEPT), são mais baseados na memória e têm gatilhos previsíveis. Essas divergências, diz Han, são a razão pela qual é fundamental construir esse mapa cerebral específico do pânico, para que os investigadores possam criar terapêuticas especialmente adaptadas a ele.\n\"Descobrimos que a atividade dos neurônios produtores de Pacapé inibida durante condições de ansiedade e eventos de memória traumática - a amígdala do camundongo, na verdade, inibe diretamente esses neurônios\", diz Han. \"Como a ansiedade parece funcionar de forma inversa à do circuito cerebral do pânico, seria interessante observar a interação entre ambos, uma vez que precisamos explicar agora como as pessoas com transtorno de ansiedade têm maior tendência a sofrer ataques de pânico.\"\nConfira as informações no\nCorreio Braziliense.\nCOMENTÁRIOS\nOs comentários a seguir não representam a opinião do jornal Diario de Pernambuco; a responsabilidade é do autor da mensagem.\nMAIS NOTÍCIAS DO CANAL\n[]https://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/noticia/cienciaesaude/2023/12/saiba-quais-foram-os-estudos-cientificos-mais-relevantes-de-2023.html\nSaiba quais foram os estudos científicos mais relevantes de 2023\nA revista Science selecionou os estudos mais relevantes de 2023.
