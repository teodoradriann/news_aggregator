    "text": "Never Stop Driving #118: Community Standards I’m thinking about the folks in Florida and the Southeast this week as they begin to recover from Hurricane Milton. At times like these, our special cars are not the priority, yet of course Hagerty is here to help. Several team members are also volunteering in the Asheville cleanup effort from Hurricane Helene, and the Hagerty claims department is on call seven days a week at 800-385-0274 or claims@hagerty.com. Hagerty monitors the storms to anticipate needs and help owners protect their cars along with the rest of their property. Last weekend, I watched videos from helicopter pilots who flew in supplies to residents stranded after Hurricane Helene, including this one from the [feed of former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle.](https://www.instagram.com/gbiffle/reels/?hl=en) Many of the affected communities in western North Carolina are in steep, inaccessible valleys that can only be seen from the air, since the roads are washed away. Biffle’s videos showed just how bad the damage was. Local news crews, which once would have supplied this information in spades, often no longer have the budgets to cover such disasters, so we’re left with social media platforms. Biffle’s videos were terrific, so I was shocked by some of the petty, downright mean viewer comments. People accused some of the other volunteers of being grandstanders for also posting videos about their rescue efforts. Viewer comments on websites, YouTube, and other digital platforms are a longtime thorn in the side of content producers. You want to build an engaged online community with free-flowing conversations and insights, but there are always people who will say things through a keyboard that they wouldn’t dare say face to face. We call them “trolls” and the rule of thumb about negative and abusive comments is “don’t feed the trolls.” It can be a minefield for editors, which is why a lot of newspapers have ceased publishing comments altogether. Through Biffle, I found [videos from Garrett Mitchell,](https://www.youtube.com/@CleetusM/videos) an automotive YouTuber I’ve long admired who is known by his stage name “Cleetus McFarland.” Hagerty Media contributing writer Sam Smith calls him, with great admiration, a carnival barker. Mitchell, who also has a helicopter, flew supplies to stranded people and transported those who needed to get out. Being a YouTuber well versed in the mechanics of videography, Mitchell documented everything, including the often-harrowing landings. I’ve never met Mitchell, but he’s a hustler, showman, and innovator in the best possible way. There is no idea that’s too stupid or ambitious for him to try. Sure, he’s playing for his massive audience, but I like his core philosophy. If an idea is decent, I often tell my kids, why wouldn’t we at least try it? Action beats talk, right? Mitchell also proves you don’t need perfect or expensive cars to have all sorts of fun on wheels, as Smith recalled after attending [a McFarland event.](https://www.hagerty.com/media/opinion/smithology/smithology-the-cleetus-mcfactor/) Speaking of actions beating talk, my car buddies have long groused that they’d like to get out and drive more. I wholeheartedly agree, so a few years ago, I organized a three-day rally which has become an annual tradition, in different locations. I plan [the routes](https://www.hagerty.com/media/magazine-features/hagerty-magazine/ohio-colonial-rufus-putnam-had-no-idea-his-town-would-become-a-beachhead-in-driving-paradise/), the overnight stops, and the food, setting the scene for a relaxing few days to share our passion. It’s super fun and I encourage you to do the same. Someone has to be the organizer so it might as well be you. We’re better versions of ourselves when we’re physically together so as much as I appreciate you reading this digital article, I’m also encouraging you to close the laptop, pull the car out of the garage, and get out and mingle.

    "text": "NEW YORK, Dec. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI) between August 15, 2022 and September 27, 2023, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important January 2, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action commenced by the Firm.\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Brainstorm Cell securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Brainstorm Cell class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=19375 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 2, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Brainstorm Cell downplayed the severity of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) refusal to file letter; (2) Brainstorm Cell continued to conceal the risks associated with the submission of the biologics license application (“BLA”); and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the Brainstorm Cell class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=19375 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm .\nRosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation.

Desde la madrugada del 21 de junio comenzó a operar la nueva estructura, que tiene dos calzadas de seis metros de ancho, y que tendrá circulación mixta.\n“A partir de hoy, los vehículos que circulan de occidente a oriente, al llegar a la carrera 68G bis tomarán hacia la izquierda para incorporarse al nuevo puente, y tras atravesarlo retomarán la calzada sur de la avenida Primero de Mayo a la altura de la carrera 52 C. Así mismo, los vehículos que vienen de oriente a occidente tomarán el nuevo puente y seguirán transitando como lo veían haciendo ”, explicó el Distrito en un comunicado.\nSobre la demolición del puente en el costado sur, la obra se extendería hasta el primer semestre de 2025, y al momento de entregarse tendrá un viaducto, que se conectará con otro puente, por lo que la totalidad del proyecto se entregaría hasta el primer trimestre de 2026.\nEl distrito le pide a la ciudadanía que se tomen ciertas medidas para no impactar la movilidad en el sector, por ejemplo, que los peatones transiten por los andenes, que los conductores estén atentos y respeten la señalización.",

    "text": "(Reprodução: Instagram) O atacante Savinho, que começou a carreira no Atlético e atualmente defende o Manchester City, foi indicado ao Prêmio Kopa pela revista France Football, que reconhece o melhor jovem jogador do futebol europeu. A indicação de Savinho, de apenas 20 anos, coloca-o ao lado de outros talentos promissores como Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United), Arda Güler (Real Madrid) e Lamine Yamal (Barcelona). Apesar de sua recente ausência na última convocação da Seleção Brasileira por Dorival Júnior, Savinho tem mostrado seu valor no cenário internacional. Sob a orientação de Pep Guardiola, ele tem recebido elogios pela sua performance em campo e pela sua rápida adaptação ao estilo de jogo do Manchester City. A lista dos indicados ao Prêmio Kopa também inclui Pau Cubarsi (Barcelona), Karim Konaté (RB Salzburg), Kobie Mainoo (Manchester United), João Neves (Benfica e PSG), Mathys Tel (Bayern de Munique) e Warren Zaïre-Emery (PSG), refletindo uma diversidade de talentos que vêm se destacando nas principais ligas europeias. Savinho foi revelado pelo Galo em 2020. Pelo time principal, foram 35 partidas, dois gols e uma assistência. Além disso, ele participou dos títulos do Campeonato Mineiro de 2020 e 2021, da Copa do Brasil de 2021 e do Campeonato Brasileiro de 2021. Leia mais",
