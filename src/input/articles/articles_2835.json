    "text": "PETALING JAYA: An animated short film on the pangolin and the dangers the animal faces from traffickers is being launched online in celebration of World Pangolin Day on Saturday (Feb 17). The almost four-minute animation, titled \"The Astounding Secret Pangolin\", tells how the anteater's scaly hide is both its armour and a vulnerability as it is highly sought after by poachers. Launched online by wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, the short was made by Malaysian animator Faril Izzadi Mohd Noor, based on a picture book of the same name by United Kingdom-based illustrator Jeanette Ward and book designer Mary Hays. ALSO READ: Genetic test tracks origins of illegal pangolin products in China, adding to conservation toolkit Tailored for young students, the animation was designed to be used in tandem with English language and art exercises to showcase the pangolin's many unique features. \"The lessons and a fact sheet for teachers have been designed to help them broach the issue of poaching and illegal trade with a young audience, especially those who live in countries with wild pangolins or where it may be consumed,\" said Traffic in a statement on Friday (Feb 16). Hays, who came up with the idea of a picture book when she heard about the plight of pangolins, approached Ward to illustrate it. \"In 2016, I was looking for an idea for a children's story when I came across a Cambridge Museum of Zoology fact sheet on pangolins. \"Astonished that I'd never heard of this extraordinary mammal, I wondered how to tell, in some respects, this devastating story specifically to children. ALSO READ: Little-known pangolin presence on Gaya Island plays key role in ecosystem \"It needed to be both factual and endearing, and I knew Jeanette would be the perfect illustrator for the task! Her attention to detail and sensitive, empathetic approach has perfectly conveyed both the unique charm of these creatures and their precarious situation. \"It is fantastic to see it brought even further to life with Faril's gentle animation,\" said Hays. \"It's wonderful working with Traffic and to play our part in helping young people understand just how important and astounding pangolins really are,\" said Ward. Both Ward and Hays donated the use of the book's words and images to Traffic after being inspired by the organisation's work on pangolins. Faril previously served as a graphic designer at Traffic's South-East Asia programme office. Faril said the project perfectly combined his passions for art and wildlife, something he had always wanted to do. ALSO READ: Pangolin scales trade cracked \"I feel fortunate to have had this opportunity and hope this animation can bring us a step closer to saving pangolins.\" The mother pangolin and its pup in the animation are inspired by the Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), which is found in South-East Asia, including Malaysia. Kanitha Krishnasamy, Traffic director for South-East Asia, thanked Hays, Ward and Faril for their masterful work in creating the stunning visuals and captivating storytelling, and for choosing to partner with the organisation. \"We hope it ignites curiosity and interest in conservation in young minds and educators alike,\" she said. Believed to be the world's most trafficked mammal, the pangolin is sought by poachers for its scales, which are wrongly believed to have medicinal properties. ALSO READ: Sunda pangolins facing extinction due to poaching Several pangolin species have been hunted to near extinction. South-East Asia is not only a major source and consumer of Asian pangolin species but also a destination and transit point for trafficked African pangolin species. Despite the prohibition on all pangolin species from commercial international trade since 2019, more than 2,300 pangolin trafficking seizures were recorded across Asia between 2014 and last year. A total volume of 419 tonnes of pangolin parts was confiscated, comprising almost 48,500 whole animals and 319 tonnes of pangolin scales.

    "text": "Christmas cheer has deserted the streets of Syria's cities, where the main churches have limited celebrations to prayers in solidarity with Palestinians suffering war in Gaza.\n\"In Palestine, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, people are suffering,\" the Syriac Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, Mor Dionysius Antoine Shahda, told AFP.\nThe northern Syrian city's central district of Azizia is usually home to a bustling festive market and a huge Christmas tree, while its streets are adorned with lights and trinkets.\nBut this year, the main square is almost empty and there are no Christmas decorations in sight.\n\"In Syria we cancelled all official celebrations and receptions in our churches in solidarity with the victims of the bombing on Gaza\" by Israeli forces, Shahda said.\nThe Syriac Catholic Church was not alone, with the leaders of three of Syria's major churches - the Greek Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox and Melkite Greek Catholic patriarchs - announcing they were cancelling Christmas festivities and limiting celebrations to religious ceremonies.\n\"Given the current circumstances, especially in Gaza, the patriarchs apologise for not receiving Christmas and New Year greetings,\" the trio said in a joint statement, adding they were limiting ceremonies to \"prayers\".\nThe health ministry in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory says more than 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched its massive air and ground offensive, in response to a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7.\nMost of the dead in Gaza are women and children, officials say.\nThe Hamas attack killed about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nMany Gazans have been displaced by the violence and forced into crowded shelters or tents, often struggling to find food, fuel, water and medical care.\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said the ongoing Israeli military campaign left no safe place anywhere across the narrow territory.\n'No opportunity for joy'\nBefore Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, it was home to more than 1.2 million Christians, though huge numbers have fled since.\nThe conflict had dampened Christmas celebrations, but festivities picked up in recent years as the main front lines froze and government forces retook control of large swathes of the country.\nStill, gloom now prevails in the streets of the capital Damascus.\nFestivities are limited to a lone market, while the Greek Orthodox Mariamite Cathedral in Damascus has put up modest decorations and a small tree in its courtyard.\nDamascus resident Rachel Haddad, 66, said she had been glued to her phone for more than two months, reading news of the devastation in Gaza, and did not have the heart to put up a Christmas tree.\n\"This year was very sad. It began with the earthquake and ended with the Gaza war,\" Haddad said, referring to the February 6 tremor that ripped through southern Turkey and Syria, killing at least 55,000 people.\n\"There was no opportunity for joy,\" she said, also blaming Syria's economic woes.\nThe country's economy has been battered by war, with recurrent fuel shortages and long, daily power cuts a fact of life.\n\"If there is no electricity, how will you see the decorations and lights anyway?\" Haddad asked.",

    "title": "New laws to protect New Hampshire’s covered bridges",
    "text": "CORNISH — Upper Valley lawmakers and police officers hope two new laws will help protect New Hampshire’s covered bridges from oversized vehicles.\nHouse Bill 1457-FN will increase the fines for motorists who damage covered bridges to $1,000 for a first offense; HB 1217, put forth by Swanzey Rep. Barry Faulkner, will allow municipalities and the state to install cameras near covered bridges “to identify the cause of damage to historic covered bridges,” to hold motorists who harm them accountable.\nBoth laws passed the Legislature with little debate and were signed into law by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu July 3. The video law will go into effect on Sept. 1, while the fine increases will begin on Jan. 1. If cameras are installed at a covered bridge, there must be signs up to let motorists know they are being recorded.\n“This is really preventative, not punitive,” state Rep. Margaret Drye, who introduced the bill regarding fines and was a cosponsor of the camera bill, said in a phone interview. “The idea isn’t that we make money for writing tickets. The idea is we stop people from hitting the covered bridges.”\nDrye is a Republican who represents Plainfield, Cornish, Newport, Unity and Charlestown. Her district includes the historic Cornish/Windsor Covered Bridge, which has been damaged repeatedly over the years by oversized vehicles.\nBoth new laws were welcomed by Lyme Police Chief Shaun J. O’Keefe and Cornish Police Chief Doug Hackett.\nIn Lyme, construction on the Edgell Covered Bridge on River Road is set to begin this month, in part to repair damage sustained from vehicles that are too tall and too wide. The covered bridge sits at the bottom of a hill on windy road.\n“Trailers often are the problem,” O’Keefe said in a phone interview. “They’re too wide and once the vehicle is in the bridge, the trailer is at this weird angle and they start to drag it through and the damage is caused.”\nWhile O’Keefe said it is too soon to say if the town will install cameras, it is something he plans to discuss with the Selectboard.\n“People’s behaviors are different when they know they’re being watched,” he said. “We’re going to spend hundreds on thousands of dollars to fix this bridge, and the last thing we want is someone to come back through and damage it.”\nSince the Cornish/Windsor bridge is owned by the state, Hackett plans on asking the N.H. Department of Transportation about installing cameras to monitor it.\nIn the meantime, he is excited to be able to write issue larger fines to people who damage covered bridges — particularly the Cornish/Windsor bridge, which is struck multiple times a year by oversized vehicles. There are also three other covered bridges in Cornish that have been damaged multiple times over the years.\nCurrently, he can only write a $62 ticket for “disobeying a traffic control device” — a penalty that he said is not enough to dissuade drivers from attempting to use a bridge to reduce travel time.\nThe new fine also is in line with Vermont’s penalties for damaging covered bridges, which also start at $1,000.\n“I think the $1,000 is a better deterrent,” Hackett said in a phone interview. “I’m excited to finally have a tool in my tool belt to discourage people to cross the bridge with an overweight or over-height vehicle.”\nHB 1457-FN also will allow police to issue a $500 ticket to any motorist driving a vehicle that “exceeds any weight, height, or other dimensional limit,” even if they do not cause damage to a bridge. “If the offense substantially impedes the flow of traffic, the fine shall be up to $2,000,” according to the law.\nEven if an overweight vehicle doesn’t visibly damage a covered bridge, “repeated incidents will cause excessive stress on the structural components resulting in long-term damage which will likely be costly to repair,” said Bill Caswell, president of the nonprofit National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges.\nThe nonprofit supported both new laws. Caswell doesn’t expect that the higher fines will completely fix the problem, but he hopes they will help drivers understand that “we care about our state’s historic structures and wish to protect them from damage,” he said in an email.\nThere are 25 states — including New Hampshire and Vermont — that have covered bridges that are open to vehicles, Caswell said.\n“The only true solution is to find a way to have drivers pay attention to and respect the posted clearance and weight limit signs,” he wrote. “We are hoping that allowing towns to install video surveillance and increasing fines will help.”\nN.H. state Rep. Bill Palmer, a Democrat who represents Cornish and Plainfield, decided to support HB 1457-F after talking to Hackett and Drye about it.\nWhile he is pleased there will be more protection for the state’s covered bridges, he cautioned, “it only works if people know about it. I’m hoping at least locally we will see some notices to make people more aware of it.”",
