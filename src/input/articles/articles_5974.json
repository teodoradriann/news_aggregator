    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n新华社呼和浩特3月12日电（记者 李云平）当前，作为“三北”工程攻坚战主阵地的内蒙古黄河“几字弯”地区紧抓植树造林的黄金期，全面开展防风固沙、光伏治沙等工作，进一步筑牢我国北方重要生态安全屏障。\n连日来，在巴彦淖尔市乌拉特后旗西补隆林业管护中心未治理沙地中，工人们一边铺芦苇，一边用铁锹压制沙障。该管护中心主任杜永军说：“我们先用长度为60厘米到80厘米的芦苇压制草方格，固定流沙，然后在其中种植灌木，最终实现治理沙地的目的。”\n记者在现场看到，经过工人连续作业，网格状沙障在连绵起伏的沙丘上铺展开，犹如一张巨网紧紧锁住流沙。乌拉特后旗林业和草原局局长陈玉云说：“乌拉特后旗既是我国北方防沙治沙重点区域，也是阴山北麓国家级生态功能区。为防止乌兰布和、巴音温都尔两大沙漠在乌拉特后旗‘握手’，我们实施‘工程固沙+造林’系统治理，综合采取乔木灌木造林、种草、封育飞播等措施，持续巩固管护区域内荒漠化土地面积减少、危害程度降低的良好态势。”\n与此同时，巴彦淖尔市磴口县乌兰布和沙漠光伏治沙基地呈现一派繁忙景象。在绵延数公里的光伏板下，工人们有的铺秸秆、压沙障，有的操作沙障铺设机将秸秆嵌入沙地，用一个个草方格锁住流沙。磴口县防沙治沙局局长吴彦杰说：“现在，我们加快实施黄河‘几字弯’攻坚战，重点推进乌兰布和沙漠防沙治沙项目，率先开工生物固沙、退化湿地修复、退化林修复、风电光伏一体化工程，确保在10月底前全面完成建设任务。”\n巴彦淖尔市地处黄河“几字弯”顶端，境内分布有乌兰布和沙漠、河套灌区、沙化草原区等，生态治理任务较重。巴彦淖尔市林业和草原局局长陈海维告诉记者，全市统筹推进产业治沙、科技治沙、全民治沙，形成了“政府主导、主体多元、全民参与”的防沙治沙格局，不断“锁”沙逐绿，拓宽“绿色防线”，进一步筑牢我国北方重要生态安全屏障。\n黄河“几字弯”地跨我国华北、西北地区，是影响京津冀地区的风沙源区和路径区。内蒙古境内的黄河“几字弯”涉及7个盟市35个旗县区，沙化土地总面积2.27亿亩，是沙化土地分布较为集中、程度较为严重的地区，是生态治理攻坚战的主战场。\n内蒙古自治区林业和草原局副局长马强说，巴彦淖尔市防沙治沙工作是内蒙古持续推动黄河“几字弯”生态治理的缩影。内蒙古在黄河“几字弯”攻坚战片区统筹山水林田湖草沙一体化保护和系统治理，打破盟市等行政区划界限，推进区域联防联治，重点解决好沙患、水患、盐渍化等生态问题，进一步减少黄河输沙量。\n（责任编辑：杨淼）",

    "text": "8月14日消息，美国人工智能初创企业 OpenAI 此前在诉状中指称，埃隆· 马斯克 （Elon Musk）在法庭内外对公司展开了“长达数年的骚扰行动”。一名联邦 法官 已裁定，马斯克必须面对这一 指控 。\n当地时间本周二，美国地方法院法官伊冯·冈萨雷斯·罗杰斯（Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers）驳回了马斯克的一项请求。OpenAI指控马斯克利用法律诉讼、社交媒体发文及媒体言论等手段意图打压公司，从而为他自己创办的生成式人工智能公司xAI争取竞争优势，而马斯克请求法官驳回的正是这些指控。\n此项裁决为双方始于去年的法律战带来了最新转折。当时，马斯克指控OpenAI背弃非营利组织的创立初衷，2019年也就是马斯克离开OpenAI董事会的次年，开始从 微软 接受数十亿美元的投资。马斯克本人则在2023年创立了xAI公司。\n罗杰斯法官并未就OpenAI反诉状中“马斯克试图持续打压公司”的指控本身作出实质性评判，但她裁定，OpenAI于今年4月份提交的反诉在法律上理由充分，可以继续推进。此外，罗杰斯法官还驳回了马斯克针对OpenAI和微软的部分指控。\n法官指出，双方都互相指责对方虚伪。\n她在裁决书中写道：“双方的博弈伎俩昭然若揭，各自都出尔反尔。”\n此案计划于明年3月在加州奥克兰联邦法院开庭审理。\n由于已过正常工作时间，马斯克的律师未立即回应置评请求。（辰辰）\n本文来源：网易科技报道 责任编辑： 王凤枝_NT2541",

    "text": "La canciller de Ecuador, Gabriela Sommerfeld, calificó el jueves de “muy fuertes” los dichos del presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, en los que cuestiona la forma en cómo el “muy joven” presidente Daniel Noboa gobierna su país convertido en “berenjenal”.\n“Fueron muy fuertes las declaraciones de ayer del presidente Maduro”, dijo la diplomática en la primera reacción de Quito desde la declaración del gobernante venezolano ante magistrados del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (TSJ).\n“No te conozco, Noboa, eres muy joven (…) tienes que estar preocupado por tu país, que no gobiernas tu país, que llegaste a abrirle las puertas al Comando Sur (de Estados Unidos), al diablo. Ocúpate de tu país, que tienes un berenjenal y no sabes qué hacer”, dijo Maduro.\nNoboa, de 36 años, el mandatario más joven en la historia ecuatoriana, ha señalado que no reconocerá los resultados de la elección presidencial de este año en Venezuela luego de que el TSJ decidió mantener la inhabilitación política por 15 años contra María Corina Machado, ganadora de las internas de la oposición para ser la candidata que enfrente a Maduro.\n“Estás amenazando a Venezuela desde Ecuador, Noboa. No le abras las puertas de tu país al diablo y te digo algo que es peor, piénsalo bien cuando te vas a meter con Venezuela. Mírame a los ojos, el que se mete con Venezuela se seca y te vas a secar, deja de meterte con nosotros”, continuó el gobernante venezolano.\nAutoproclamado de centroizquierda y apoyado por fuerzas de derecha, Noboa apoya las “elecciones libres en Venezuela, que exista transparencia en ese acto democrático, que se fortalezca la democracia”, según Sommerfeld.\nLa canciller indicó que junto al mandatario ecuatoriano evalúan si contestan a Venezuela. “Hay que tomar las cosas con calma, no se puede responder con el estomago o con el hígado (…) es importante ser prudentes, pero contundentes con las posiciones y la política exterior”, precisó.\nEcuador rompió relaciones diplomáticas con Venezuela en 2019, durante el gobierno de Lenín Moreno (2017-2021), exaliado del exmandatario socialista Rafael Correa (2007-2017).\nNoboa, en el poder desde noviembre para un período de 18 meses, sostiene una guerra contra grupos narcotraficantes que en enero arremetieron contra el Estado y la población. Una veintena de personas murió en la ola violenta y más de 200 policías y guardias penitenciarios fueron tomados como rehenes temporalmente dentro y fuera de cárceles.\nEl gobernante declaró al país en conflicto armado interno y recibe apoyo de Estados Unidos en su lucha contra el narco.

    "text": "TORONTO — Commuters across the Greater Toronto Area and parts of eastern Ontario had to contend with blowing snow and slippery sidewalks while heading home Friday evening as a blast of wintery weather hit parts of the province.\nEnvironment Canada has placed a region stretching from Hamilton all the way east past Kingston, Ont., under snowfall warnings, saying it was predicting up to 15 centimetres of snow.\nThe weather agency says the snow is expected to continue into the evening and then is set to taper off from west to east late in the night.\nIt warns the snowfall could have \"significant impact\" on the evening commute, making for low visibility and potentially slick roadways.\nEnvironment Canada has said peak snowfall rates of two centimetres per hour are possible.\nIt says surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\nThe agency says people should be ready to adjust their driving with changing road conditions.\nIt says drivers should turn on their lights and maintain a safe following distance if visibility is reduced while driving.\nOther parts of Ontario, including Windsor and London, are under a weather advisory, with between five and 10 centimetres of snow in the forecast.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March. 22, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

Así lo ha trasladado el comité de la UTE Acceso Porto Exterior A Coruña sobre la situación de los trabajadores de las obras de construcción de los túneles que darán acceso ferroviario la Punta Langosteira.\nLa Autoridad Portuaria de A Coruña adjudicará en diciembre el Plan Estratégico del puerto Una convocatoria de huelga que denuncian que surge ante la imposibilidad de llegar a un acuerdo con la empresa en materia de vacaciones, retribuciones, retenciones y condiciones de seguridad en los trabajos.\n\"El descontento entre el personal por las condiciones de trabajo se viene arrastrando desde el inicio de las obras a principios de 2023. La intransigencia de la empresa llevó al personal a organizarse con la CIG en defensa de sus derechos y después de la constitución del comité, el pasado 10 de octubre, se consiguió forzar el inicio de negociaciones\", han explicado.\nEn este contexto, el secretario comarcal de la FCM-CIG, Mario Maceiras, más allá de las buenas palabras de la empresa, afirma que \"a las puertas del mes de diciembre, los trabajadores siguen sin conocer cuándo disfrutarán de sus vacaciones anuales ni como se les retribuirán\": \"Ayer mismo se produjo la última reunión con la empresa en la que tampoco fue posible un acercamiento\", criticó.\n\"Este fue el principal punto de ruptura de las conversaciones con la empresa\", aseguró, a lo que añadió que \"tras no producirse un acercamiento en la reunión de ayer, el personal acordó por mayoría convocar dos jornadas de huelga de 24 horas\".\n140 millones de inversión pública La primera será el martes 3 de diciembre desde alas 07:00 horas hasta las 07:00 horas del miércoles; y el segundo día de paro será el jueves 5 de diciembre, desde alas 07:00 horas a las 07:00 horas del viernes.\nEl paro afectará además de la contrata principal, UTE Acceso Porto Exterior A Coruña (conformada por SACYR, CAVOSA y Taboada y Ramos), a sus principales subcontratas: Actyon Tunnel, Domingo Laredo, Ecotunel y Fevelte.\nAsimismo, en un comunicado el personal confirma que no descarta, en el caso de no alcanzarse un acuerdo antes de fin de año, seguir desarrollando un calendario de movilizaciones.\nTodo ello hasta que, finalmente, \"las empresas accedan a las reivindicaciones justas del personal de la principal obra pública gallega y del norte peninsular en la actualidad, con casi 140 millones de euros de inversión pública\".\nHuelgas A Coruña Puerto de A Coruña",
