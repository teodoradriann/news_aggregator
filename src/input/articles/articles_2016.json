    "title": "Nicole Kidman calls her new film ‘Babygirl’ too erotic",
    "text": "Nicole Kidman may have filmed explicit scenes in many of her films in the past but she admits her new erotic thriller “Babygirl” is nothing like what she has done before. In a new interview, Nicole said that she has made several films ‘that are pretty exposing, but not like this.’ [Nicole](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/entertainment/sandra-bullock-and-nicole-kidman-to-reunite-for-practical-magic-2) said, “It left me ragged. At some point I was like, I don’t want to be touched. I don’t want to do this anymore, but at the same time I was compelled to do it. Halina would hold me and I would hold her, because it was just very confronting to me. It’s like, Golly, I’m doing this, and it’s actually now going to be seen by the world. That’s a very weird feeling. This is something you do and hide in your home videos. It is not a thing that normally is going to be seen by the world.” She added, “I felt very exposed as an actor, as a woman, as a human being. I had to go in and go out like, I need to put my protection back on. What have I just done? Where did I go? What did I do?” In the film, Nicole plays a successful businesswoman who leads a comfortable personal life with her husband Antonio Banderas. Trouble arrives when a new intern (Harris Dickinson) joins her company and she starts an affair with him. “Babygirl” is all set to have its world premiere at the upcoming Venice Film Festival. The film is directed by Halina Reijn and will be released in theatres on December 25.

Olivier Vandecasteele faisait partie des personnes mobilisées. Belga. Par Belga Publié le 1/02/2024 à 21:43 Temps de lecture: 2 min U n événement s’est tenu jeudi soir dans la capitale, à Bozar, pour appeler à la libération du Suédois Johan Floderus, diplomate de l’Union européenne détenu en Iran depuis plus de 650 jours et accusé par la république islamique d’espionnage pour Israël. Olivier Vandecasteele et le Français Bernard Phelan, tous deux anciens otages du régime iranien, étaient présents à la soirée de soutien.\n«Johan risque potentiellement la peine de mort. Il est urgent que le plus de personnes possibles élèvent leurs voix pour lui venir en aide», a insisté la porte-parole de la campagne #FreeJohanFloderus, Raia Mihaylova.\nCe Suédois, âgé de 33 ans, travaille pour le service diplomatique de l’UE. Le 17 avril 2022, il est arrêté à l’aéroport de Téhéran alors qu’il s’apprête à rentrer chez lui après un voyage en compagnie d’amis. Il est depuis détenu à la prison d’Evin, dans la capitale du pays.\n«Corruption sur terre» Dimanche dernier, lors de son procès, Johan Floderus a été accusé d’avoir coopéré «à grande échelle» avec Israël contre la «sécurité» de l’Iran. Il est jugé pour «corruption sur terre», soit l’un des chefs d’accusation les plus graves en Iran et passible de la peine de mort. Le verdict de son procès, qui a débuté en décembre, sera prononcé à une date indéterminée.\n«En tant que prisonnier, savoir que certaines personnes se mobilisent pour votre cause est ce qui vous nourrit», a appuyé Olivier Vandecasteele, qui avait par ailleurs partagé la cellule de Johan Floderus pendant trois semaines. «Nos geôliers peuvent nous prendre nos livres, notre nourriture, mais ils ne peuvent pas nous enlever notre espoir», a-t-il continué.\nEn organisant cet événement à Bruxelles - ville où habitait le diplomate suédois depuis 2016 - les membres de la campagne espèrent ainsi sensibiliser le plus de personnes possibles, dont des membres des institutions européennes.",

    "title": "Why Gen Zers are leaving public servant jobs - The Korea Times",
    "text": "gettyimagesbank\nMunicipal administrations rush to offer incentive programs to retain young employees By Anna J. Park Low wages, rigid work culture and ineffective systems in Korea's public service sector are driving away young public servants, encompassing millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Zers, born between 1997 and 2012 — leading an increasing number of them to ditch their jobs.\nWhile job security and a stable pension system were once considered the public service's greatest advantages, this appeal has diminished for younger generations, as low pay and a rigid organizational culture fail to meet their expectations.\nIt's now common to see YouTube videos or blog posts where former young civil servants share their reasons for leaving the job and pursuing new careers.\nNumbers back this trend.\nAccording to the Government Employees Pension Service, 28,934 civil servants with less than five years of service resigned between 2018 and 2022.\nIn 2022 alone, 13,032 public officials left their jobs, which is a whopping 72.6 percent jump from 7,548 in 2019. Among these, 3,020 civil servants resigned within just a year of their job assignment.\nA report by the National Assembly Research Service published earlier this year also showed that the proportion of newly appointed civil servants among those resigning increased to 23 percent in 2023 from 17 percent in 2019. The report identified key factors behind these resignations: low wages, concerns over pension stability and the mismatch between the values of the younger generations and the rigid culture of public service.\nThe declining appeal of public service is also evident in recruitment.\nThe competition rate for the grade 9 national civil service exam this year dropped to 21.8 to 1, the lowest since 1992. For the grade 7 exam, a more advanced national civil servant test than the grade 9, the rate also fell to 40.6 to 1 this year, from 76.7 to 1 in 2016.\nParticipants stage a protest performance at a demonstration organized by the Korean Government Employees' Union in front of the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul, Aug. 6, demanding better wages for young public officials. Korea Times file\nIn an effort to retain young public officials who are leaving their posts, the country's public servant salary committee, which negotiates with the Korean Government Employees' Union, recommended a wage increase of 2.5 percent to 3.3 percent for 2025. The government ultimately settled on a 3 percent raise.\nWhile this figure may seem modest, it is actually not only significantly higher than the 1.7 percent increase in the minimum wage for the next year but also marks the highest wage increase rate for public officials since 2017.\nIn the past four years, wage increases for public officials have remained at low levels: 0.9 percent in 2021, 1.4 percent in 2022, 1.7 percent in 2023 and 2.5 percent in 2024. As annual inflation rates during the period stood at 2.5 percent in 2021, 5.1 percent in 2022 and 3.6 percent in 2023, public officials' real wages, adjusted for inflation, have declined consistently.\nBesides the wage issue, improving the outdated organizational culture is just as crucial. Recognizing the importance of retaining young workers in the public sector, the government formed a committee in late October composed of 100 young public officials from across the country, aiming to develop measures to transform the rigid work culture within public service.\nThe committee members came up with 10 key recommendations for organizational culture reforms gathered through discussions. The 10 recommendations include: 1) no forced overtime work; 2) systemic handovers; 3) refraining from unnecessary contact outside of working hours; 4) considerate and respectful communication; 5) task allocation based on rank and experience; 6) listening to lower-level employees’ opinions in decision-making; 7) prohibiting the delegation of undesirable tasks to young officials; 8) avoiding discouragement when submitting vacation plans; 9) adjusting existing tasks when new responsibilities are added; and 10) strengthening practical training during probation periods.\n“The government is committed to continuously engaging with young officials and supporting their smooth adaptation and integration into the public service,” said Ko Ki-dong, vice minister of the interior and safety.\nComputer-generated 3D title / Courtesy of iKinoto\nSome local governments have introduced new employment benefit programs, such as long-term service leave for junior public officials, to boost the morale of young public servants.\nDaegu Metropolitan City introduced a long-term service leave system for junior public officials, aiming to prevent the departure of civil servants of the young generation. The system, which was previously only available to officials with over 10 years of service, is now available to public servants with five to 10 years of experience.\nIn addition, the city is working on creating an environment that promotes flexible use of annual leave and parental leave, as well as fostering a lunch-focused company meal culture.\nYongin in Gyeonggi Province also introduced a special leave for newcomers. According to the city's recently revised ordinance, civil servants with at least one to less than five years of service will now be granted three days of newcomer leave, which was not previously available.\nA city official stated that such incentive programs designed for junior public servants are expected to help retain young public officials.\nannajpark@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter",

    "text": "Tim Walz built his career feigning support for the Second Amendment and fundraising as a “pro-gun” Democrat who backstabbed gun owners nearly every chance he got. Gun Owners of America first rated Tim Walz as a “D.” Later, we downgraded him to an F after a litany of anti-gun votes. So why did he earn such poor marks from the only No Compromise gun lobby in Washington D.C.?\nRepresentative Tim Walz’s Voting Record\nTim Walz was first elected to Congress in 2006 and in his tenure up till 2018, he voted against gun owners consistently. In Congress, Tim Walz:\n❌ Voted to create a national registry of concealed carry permit holders.\n❌ Voted against the First and Second Amendments by attempting to force GOA to disclose our membership list (as a registry) to create a gun owner registry for the Federal Election Commission;\n❌ Voted to expose gun owners’ personal medical history, leading to bans and confiscation;\n❌ Voted to restrict the ability of Gun Owners and Hunters to use the Washington Rochambeau National Historic Trail area to create a 600 mile gun-free zone for sportsmen and hikers; and\n❌ Voted to ban carrying firearms for self-defense in national parks.\nThese votes caused Gun Owners of America to rightfully downgrade Walz from a “D” to an “F.”\nWhat Gun Control Does Governor Tim Walz Support?\nDuring his career as a congressman, Tim Walz feigned support for the Second Amendment, even though his record showed otherwise. But since becoming Governor of Minnesota, he has completely come out of the closet to reveal his true colors. Hiding behind his hunter and veteran “status” he proclaimed support for:\n👎Backdoor gun registration checks (by weaponizing background checks);\n👎Gun confiscation laws (with fake due process);\n👎A “no-fly, no-buy” gun ban (with no due process);\n👎Eliminating concealed carry permit reciprocity between states (to infringe on self-defenders);\n👎A backdoor semiautomatic firearms ban (with a fake “bump stock ban);\n👎Banning commonly owned self-defense firearms (with a so-called “assault weapons” ban)\n👎Mandatory storage requirements (with criminal penalties for access to self-defense firearms);\n👎Banning firearms on government lands (despite them being open to the public);\nClearly, being a hunter or a veteran does not automatically make a politician pro-Second Amendment.\nGovernor Tim Walz Is Responsible for These Infringements\nGovernor Walz didn’t just propose gun control, he actively infringed on the Second Amendment. As governor, Tim Walz:\n❌ Created backdoor registration checks by signing Universal Background Checks;\n❌ Weaponized gun confiscation laws with no due process against at least 71 American citizens; and\n❌ Banned lawful semiautomatic firearms with ATF-approved binary triggers;\nThese gun controls would never have infringed the rights of Minnesotans if Governor Walz had honored his oath to the Constitution.",

    "text": "Performance Breakout\nTanner Houck delivered an impressive season in 2024, recording a 3.12 ERA and a 1.142 WHIP over 30 starts. He achieved personal bests in various categories, with his overall win‐above‐replacement value nearly doubling that of his closest teammate on the mound. At 28, his emergence as a key figure in the rotation has positioned him as a standout pitcher within the team’s staff.\nContract Talks\nDespite his exceptional performance, formal discussions regarding a long-term contract extension have not progressed. Houck has indicated a clear willingness to secure his future in Boston, affirming his desire to remain with the team. His remarks underline his commitment and appreciation for the environment in which he competes, although a contract extension has yet to materialize.\nSalary and Future Plans\nThis season marked his first arbitration eligibility, culminating in a salary of $3.95 million. With free agency on the horizon after the 2027 campaign, Houck’s performance and future prospects continue to be closely watched. His forward-looking perspective, coupled with a strong track record, underscores his determination to contribute at a high level for years to come.",
