La Policía no pudo identificar de inmediato al sospechoso debido al estado en que quedó su cuerpo.\nCaptura de pantalla CCTV Un hombre dedicado presuntamente a extorsionar comerciantes murió cuando se disponía a dejar un explosivo frente al local de una de sus víctimas en la ciudad de Guayaquil, en Ecuador, informaron medios locales.\nEl hecho ocurrió en la noche de este miércoles en un sector ubicado sobre la avenida Francisco de Orellana, una de las principales arterias viales del norte de la urbe, y fue captado por una cámara de vigilancia cercana.\nSegún las imágenes, el individuo desciende de un coche rojo, camina hasta una esquina e intenta encender la mecha de un explosivo que lleva en sus manos. Luego de unos segundos, mientras manipulaba la carga, se produce una fuerte detonación. Su cómplice huye de inmediato en medio de una nube de humo.\nADVERTENCIA: LAS SIGUIENTES IMÁGENES PUEDEN HERIR SU SENSIBILIDAD\nEl ruido disparó las alarmas de algunos vehículos y puso en sobreaviso a vecinos y transeúntes. Al lugar llegaron las autoridades, quienes no pudieron identificar al sospechoso debido al estado en que quedó su cuerpo. De acuerdo con el comandante zonal de la Policía, Víctor Herrera, esa persona habría utilizado tacos de dinamita de tipo industrial, como los que se usan en la minería, recoge el canal Ecuavisa.\nEl propietario del negocio, al que al parecer iba dirigido el atentado, confirmó que, semanas atrás, había recibido amenazas extorsivas vía telefónica.

    "title": "Collaboration paves the way for BSJ students’ success in performing ‘We Will Rock You’",
    "text": "ritish School Jakarta (BSJ) recently performed the musical “We Will Rock You” (WWRY) at the school’s Raffles Stage, BSJ World Theatre, in Bintaro Jaya, South Tangerang City.\nThe more-than-two-hour electrifying musical, based upon the music of legendary British rock band Queen, and written by Ben Elton, was a successful amalgam of theatre, music and choreography, and technology-driven multimedia. The unprecedented show pinned enthusiastic audiences to their seats from beginning to end.\nThe performances on November 25, 26, and 28 showcased the students’ multiple talents as they delivered dialogue while singing and dancing, entertaining their audience of all ages.\nDuring one scene, the audience spontaneously stomped and clapped rhythmically while singing along to Queen’s iconic number from which the show takes its name. An image of one of Queen’s live performances in the 1970s, with a massive audience turnout, was visible on a large screen as the backdrop, effectively boosting the energy of the audience and creating an exciting and unifying atmosphere.\nThe audience also delightfully participated in singing “We Are the Champions”, reflecting a shared sense of fulfilment while following the story of “WWRY”, which expresses the victory of rebels led by a group known as the Bohemians whose aim is to revive the spirit of rock music.\nWhile everyone may have his/her interpretation of Queen’s lyrics to “WWRY”, the rhythm of the number is what drives the energy of the song, creating loud, exciting and powerful music.\nAt its core, the song is about triumph achieved through adversity, encouraging people to work hard and never give up hope when things get tough. During the BSJ performance, bright lights and fireworks were presented to celebrate victory, delighting and exciting the audience.\n“WWRY” and “We Are the Champions” were just two of the 23 Queen songs presented by BSJ students during the musical, with live music played by BSJ students from backstage.\nPlot-wise, “WWRY” is set in a dystopian future where individuality and live music are banned. It tells the story of how the all-powerful Global Soft Corporation, led by the ruthless Killer Queen, controls society, forcing its people to conform. However, a group of rebels called the Bohemians believe in the power of rock and roll and seek to revive real live music. They dream of a hero who will find the lost guitar of the legendary rock band Queen and bring back freedom and self-expression.\nEnter Galileo (played by Zane) and Scaramouche (played by Anissa), two unlikely rebels who feel out of place in this world of restriction and control. Together they embark on a journey to discover their identities and bring rock and roll back to life through Queen’s hits in a celebration of rebellion and a quest for freedom.\nAt one point, a 3D image of blowing fire which slowly engulfs Khashoggi (played by Finnley) and the Killer Queen (played by Amanda) was visible on the large screen, vividly depicting how the two figures who controlled the society and banned rock music eventually encountered death.\nCollaborations\nBSJ students’ collaboration with various parties was key to the success of their performance.\nAccording to BSJ, esteemed professionals Noel Sullivan, a former member of the chart-topping pop group Hear’Say, and James Bennett, celebrated for his choreography in “Strictly Come Dancing” and “Rocketman”, were involved in the production of “WWRY” as mentors.\nStudents said Noel brought valuable insights into vocal performance and stage presence, while Bennett empowered BSJ’s cast to explore and push boundaries in dance.\n“Working with Noel and James goes beyond mastering technical skills; it fosters a love for the performing arts, discipline and collaboration. Their mentorship nurtured resilience, confidence and adaptability, which are qualities that enhance students’ performance and equip them with skills for the future,” said Waltho, who helped produce the musical.\n“At its core, ‘WWRY’ celebrates individuality, resilience and the power of music, which are values that resonate deeply within our community. Over months of preparation, our students have grown as performers, young artists and team members, showcasing remarkable collaboration, discipline and self-expression,” she said.\n“Everything we do, we do for students. We want to give them the best life skills, not only related to academic accomplishment but also other practical skills for their future. We want to give them life experience. Someday, they may work in the United States or European countries. They get life experience here in Indonesia,” she said.\nMusic Director, Stephen Tomlinson expressed that great care is given to student’s potential development, which is why music, theatre, dance and other arts lessons are included in the BSJ curriculum.\n“What we do is to support students’ talent development. A musical is part of how students put arts theory into practice,” he said, adding that the school has musical concerts regularly.\nThe performance of “WWRY” involved more than 40 students aged 13 to 18.\nZane, Anissa, Amanda and Zack, four talented performers, acknowledged the demanding challenge of performing “WWRY” but said that their commitment, dedication and passion for the show enabled them to continue from start to finish.\n“I enjoyed the musical, ‘We Will Rock You’ because I have a passion for acting and singing,” said Zane, adding that studying acting at a university was one of his future possibilities.\nSharing how to keep energetic and enthusiastic during the show, Anissa said that it was like doing a math test: “In taking the test, you don’t want to stop until you finish. That’s what has kept me going,” she said.\nShe took her mom’s advice to maintain her voice quality before performing. “I chew kencur (aromatic ginger/galangal) and apple,” she said.\n“WWRY” director Jessica Yadav said she highly cherished ideas and input from all players.\nShe said that directing is about collaboration and that “everything you see in this production is a culmination of all of our ideas coming to life.”\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

    "title": "Bad weather and war are straining the world’s wheat supply - The Economic Times",
    "text": "Bad weather and war are threatening to keep the world’s wheat supplies under strain and reviving the specter of rising food costs. From soggy fields in western Europe to parched soil in Australia and Moscow’s invasion holding back Ukrainian supplies, farmers face setbacks. That means global stockpiles will remain the smallest in almost a decade, according to analysts surveyed ahead of the US government’s first forecast for next season. Bumper Black Sea harvests have long kept a lid on prices and wheat is trading at half its record set in 2022, but supply concerns are mounting again. Futures have rebounded to hit the highest since August and funds are trimming bearish bets that they’ve held for almost two years. That’s a worrying sign for consumers who’ve finally found relief from rising food prices. Any prolonged rally could increase costs for bread and pasta and rekindle inflationary pressure on central banks — with other major crops like cocoa and coffee also climbing this year.“Demand has increased, stocks remain tight globally and new crop issues are escalating,” said James Bolesworth, managing director at CRM AgriCommodities.With Northern Hemisphere harvests approaching, the next few weeks remain critical for crop development, so there’s still time for things to improve — or worsen. Here’s a roundup of conditions in major growers:Black Sea DrynessTop exporter Russia risks missing out on crucial moisture, with weeks of heat and not enough rain in the country’s south prompting analysts to cut harvest estimates. Half Russia’s winter wheat will remain too dry over the next two weeks, Commodity Weather Group said Wednesday.Russia should still reap a big crop, but its dominance means that any jolts to local prices feed through to other markets — and the country’s wheat has been getting more expensive lately. War in UkraineDryness has also hampered swaths of Ukraine’s wheat in recent weeks, but war is fueling other problems. Attacks on agriculture infrastructure threaten exports and the workforce has been depleted as men serve in the army.Grain output in the upcoming season could drop 6% from a year earlier with farmers expected to divert grain acres to more profitable crops like rapeseed.Wet Western Europe A soggy spring hurt crop development across northwest Europe. Winter-crop quality — which determines whether supplies are used for food or for animal feed — could also suffer. In France, the share of wheat and barley in top conditions lags far behind last year’s level. Rain has also slowed spring plantings in the UK, Germany and France.“We are obviously concerned by the issue of unplanted areas given it is linked to the weather conditions,” Benoit Pietrement, chair of the grains council at crops office FranceAgriMer, said last month.Parched Australia A dry, hot summer in parts of Australia has dried up soil just as farmers plant the crop. While recent rain provided a bit of relief in some areas of the key state of Western Australia, growers remain cautious.Crops risk “frying” in the state if rain stops after germination, Dennis Voznesenski, associate director of sustainable and agricultural economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said this week. Wheat’s rally both locally and globally has been faster than expected, he said.Dry US Drought has gripped a bigger share of US winter-wheat fields since early April, and remains a concern for spring plantings, even as recent forecasts indicate showers. Still, more US winter wheat is in the top conditions than usual for this time of year and spring plantings remain ahead of the five-year average pace.Crop concerns are showing up in prices, with money managers now the least bearish since July. But things could change before the first Northern Hemisphere harvests start in roughly four weeks.There is “a lot of weather to trade yet, the crop is far from being complete and if rains show up they will have value,” said Matt Ammermann, a commodity risk manager at StoneX. “It now remains a wait-and-see type of game.”",

    "text": "The Vice-Chancellor of McPherson University, Ajebo, Ogun State, Professor Francis Igbasan, in this interview with JOHNSON IDOWU and DARE OLAIWIN, speaks on the allocation for education in the 2024 budget among other issues that affect education in Nigeria Recently, President Bola Tinubu presented the 2024 budget to the National Assembly. In the proposed budget, N2.18tn was earmarked for education accounting for 7.9% of the total budget. Do you think this is enough to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal on Education? Year in and year out, people in the academic sector are always disappointed by the attitude of our government because the budget they have always presented has always fallen short of UNESCO’s recommendations. UNESCO recommends that 25 per cent of the budget should be dedicated to education. Education is the bedrock of development. If you are talking about military, water, and everything, if you don’t have education, you will miss out completely. All these other sectors that the government budgets millions on, especially security take the junk out of our budget every year, and cannot achieve its objectives without education. Sadly, this money ends up in individuals’ pockets which is why we are getting what we are getting in terms of education quality. And this is why some of our graduates today from public universities can no longer compete effectively with their counterparts in the world. Some of them cannot even compete favourably with graduates from private institutions because private institutions have better equipment and facilities to train their students compared to public universities. I came from a public university and I know what is tenable there and what the public universities are going through. The government has not taken that bold step to focus on the development of education. The budget is a big disappointment. One expects that President Tinubu will do better but he has followed the trend. He has not improved with the seven per cent allocation out of the 25 per cent that was prescribed by UNESCO and those of us in the education sector have been clamouring every year that the budget for education is grossly inadequate. The Federal Government is using over N6.5bn to buy a presidential yacht, how does that improve education? The N6.5bn cannot be expended on salaries of ASUU (Academic Staff Union of Universities) members. My advice is for the government to shift their focus from what they believe in which is shortchanging education by not funding education. Are you saying private universities are doing better than all the public universities in Nigeria? They are doing better. It may not be all the public universities in Nigeria but the majority of the public universities in Nigeria are wallowing in abject poverty. What I mean is that in terms of facilities and manpower, most of the public universities today are empty. The personnel, the lecturers, those who are qualified, and those who are experts have all left the country. The japa syndrome is affecting education in a very serious way. There are some departments in public universities that when you go there, you will only see two or three lecturers. The brains are going and now we are not realising what the impact would be but in the near future, we will see the negative impact. Every year we talk about the 2050 millennium development goal but every year we are doing nothing and by 2050, we will realise we have not achieved anything just because our leaders failed to realise that education is key and it is the bedrock of development. Gone are the days when you say private universities do not have resources but today, in many private universities, I can say that 90% of private universities in this country are well equipped more than what is applicable in public universities. In your opinion, what is the viability of the student loan initiative of the Federal Government? Well, the Federal Government has announced that it is starting student loans but the question is have they started implementing it? Let us wait and see when the implementation will start. By the time it commences and between one year or two, we should be able to assess them. By then, we can look at who are those people getting the loans. Are they the indigent students or the loan is being granted to children of the political class? You know the Nigeria factor, they would say they are giving loans to the children of the less privileged like mechanics, vulcanizers and others but by the time you look at the list and the beneficiaries, you will discover that the money is circulating within the same circle. Let us wait until the implementation starts and in another two to three years, we should be able to assess the success or otherwise of the initiative. It is too early to say whether it will go far or not. It is a good development but the problem is how will the implementation works. What is your stand concerning the conversion program of the NBTE in collaboration with some foreign universities which has received condemnation from the NUC? I will pitch my tent with the National University Commission because anything that relates to the first degree is regulated by the NUC and the commission has a list of recognised universities around the world. For instance, if someone comes from Ukraine with a certificate from any university in Ukraine, the first point of call is the NUC to look at the certificate and examine if the university is recognised. If somebody does a conversion program in a university that is not recognised, what happens to that certificate? We have renowned universities in this country where anybody who graduates from polytechnics or colleges of education can do whatever conversion they intend to do. Somebody brought a certificate to this school recently, a PhD certificate which he claimed he did online with a university in America and I asked him at the interview how is it possible to do a PhD online, a PhD by research. How did you do the research? These are some of the things we see in the education sector but it is the responsibility of the NUC to regulate such anomalies. So, it is the NUC that I will support. If anyone wants to do a conversion, let them do it in accredited universities in Nigeria and not just a conversion that they will do online and get a certificate within six months without attending classes. In the face of the harsh economy, is there any compelling need for MacPherson to increase its fee? We have done that. We did that marginally by adding a small amount to our fees because when you look at the economic situation in the country it is no longer feasible for us to stay where we were a year ago. A little of petrol you know the amount. A bag of cement has gone up compared to what it was last year and we need to put infrastructures in place. Also, our staff are agitating for a better salary. For instance, starting from December 1, we increased our staff salary by 30%. So, by the end of December, they will take 30% higher than what they have been getting before. What we did to ensure that the increase does not affect the parents is that we allowed them to pay the fees four times in a session. We split the payment process into four and this has really helped the parents who have, in turn, commended us for our magnanimity. We have over 25 accredited courses that we are running among which are Law, Nursing, Medical Laboratory Science among others.",

    "text": "COLUMBIA, Tenn. ( WSMV /Gray News) - On Wednesday, after seeing the baseball-sized hail falling in her front yard in Hohenwald, Tennessee, Sandy Goff’s immediate thought was of her son Cody Frizzell and his fiancé.\nFrizzell was driving in Columbia, and Goff knew the storm was heading their way.\n“I couldn’t think of them being out in it. That’s what scared me,” Goff said.\nFrizzell said the sky was bright and sunny when his mother called, warning him of what was coming. He asked her where they should go.\n“Where’s the best place where we could stop and seek shelter? And she said Walmart,” Frizzell said.\nWith his mother still on the line and heavy rain starting to fall, Frizzell said he and his fiancé approached the store at 2200 Brookmeade Drive in Columbia where employees in blue Walmart vests were standing.\n“One of the people stopped (his fiancé) and said, ‘No, you can’t come in. There’s a tornado warning. We’re not letting anyone in,’” Frizzell said. “I said, ‘Where are we supposed to go?’ And she said, ‘I don’t care, but you can’t stay here.’”\nGoff, listening on the line, was irate. “He said they’re not letting us in. And I said, ‘What? What do you mean they’re not letting you in?’” Goff said.\nFrizzell said he and his fiancé weren’t the only ones prevented from entering the store.\n“There was a couple behind us and they weren’t letting them in either,” Frizell said.\nWSMV4 Investigates spoke with the manager at the Columbia Walmart, but she said she could not comment and referred our questions to corporate communications.\nBrian Little, global communications director for Walmart, wrote in an email to WSMV4 Investigates: “The safety of our customers during weather events like what occurred recently in Columbia, TN is a priority. During the storm customers inside our store as well as others who requested to enter were allowed to shelter in place. While we can’t confirm who this individual spoke with, we do allow people to shelter in place inside our stores.”\nFrizzell said he and his fiancé rushed to another store that agreed to allow them to shelter in place.\nWSMV4 Investigates spoke with a manager at the store, and she confirmed that they sheltered people who had been turned away from Walmart.\n“I’m angry. Hurt. And if something had happened to them, I don’t know what I would have done,” Goff said.\nCopyright 2024 WSMV via Gray Media Group, Inc. ",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "Beloved teacher says he was fired from Long Island Catholic elementary school for being gay",
    "text": "A gay third-grade teacher says he was fired from his job at a Catholic elementary school in Long Island after someone had sent the local diocese photos of him kissing his boyfriend. Michael Califano, 26, learned of his termination from Maria Regina School in Seaford, New York, Wednesday, after being told that he had violated diocese guidelines related to “living a Catholic lifestyle,” News 12 Long Island reported. “Somebody had sent in some pictures of my boyfriend and I, and it escalated from there,” he told the outlet. Califano said he did not feel that he had done anything wrong. Califano has deep roots in the Maria Regina community: He has been a parishioner at the local church for years and had attended the school as a child, as did his late father, veteran Nassau County police officer Michael Califano, who was killed in a crash in 2011 when his son was just 13 years old. The Califano family fundraises at the school each year for scholarships in the fallen cop’s name. “I didn’t think this would happen in 2023, even in the Catholic Church,” Califano said. Many parents and students have come to Califano’s defense on social media and through a petition on Change.org demanding that he be reinstated. The author of the online petition, which so far has drawn more than 2,650 signatures, praised Califano as “an immensely beloved, committed and diligent educator” whose ouster “not only affects Michael personally but it also deprives the community of a dedicated servant who consistently contributed to its enrichment.” The petition goes on to say that the decision to fire Califano was based on a “malicious” anonymous email from someone who had gone “digging” for photos of Califano and his boyfriend on a social media account that was not even his own with the apparent intent of getting him fired. Califano told Newsday that both the school and the diocese were aware that he was gay when they hired him two years ago, and no one ever raised questions about his sexuality until the Rev. John O. Barres, the bishop of the diocese, received the email with the kissing pictures from his boyfriend’s Facebook page. “They said they found things on that account that were inappropriate for a Catholic schoolteacher,” said Califano. “There’s nothing vulgar on that account.” Mary Ann Hasbrouck, a retired teacher, slammed Califano’s firing as a “kind of a witch hunt.” “This gentleman teaches at the school, he is beloved by all the students and parents, did a great job, goes above and beyond,” she said, adding that everyone was “blindsided” by the diocese’s decision to fire him. Parent Toni Lichtenberger said Califano helped her daughter through her school anxiety when she was in his class last year. Califano said that if he were told he could have his job back, he would accept without any hesitation. The Post reached out to the Diocese of Rockville Centre seeking comment on Califano’s firing. Meanwhile, parents are planning to stage a rally in support of Califano in front of St. Agnes Cathedral later Friday.",
