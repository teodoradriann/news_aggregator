    "text": "The Trump administration’s push to deploy modern technology in environmental permitting is being hailed as a smart move by former government officials on both sides of the aisle.\nThe positive reaction is a dramatic shift—congressional Democrats and environmentalists have generally opposed almost every other permitting tweak President Donald Trump has announced. Still, questions linger about which technology vendors will provide the solutions and whether documents produced with artificial intelligence (AI) will stand up in court.\nTrump’s Tuesday memo directs federal agencies to make “maximum use” of technology in permitting, though it doesn’t mention any specific technology by name. It’s his ...\nLearn more about Bloomberg Law or Log In to keep reading:\nLearn About Bloomberg Law\nAI-powered legal analytics, workflow tools and premium legal & business news.\nAlready a subscriber?\nLog in to keep reading or access research tools.",

    "text": "Attenzione alle prossime ore per l'arrivo di altri temporali, anche a carattere di forte intensità, che potranno colpire alcune regioni del nostro Paese dove ci attendiamo locali grandinate e forti raffiche di vento a causa del fenomeno del downburst. Dopo settimane di caldo intenso e cieli sereni, il meteo sta cambiando volto su alcuni settori del Bel Paese. L'anticiclone africano Caronte, che sta dominando la scena negli ultimi giorni, mostra infatti alcuni segni di cedimento, aprendo la strada a infiltrazioni d'aria più fresca e instabile di matrice oceanica. Il Nord Italia sarà il protagonista di questo cambiamento. Dopo i primi temporali di Giovedì 1, nel corso delle prossime ore, altri segnali d'instabilità saranno evidenti: nubi sempre più dense si addenseranno sull'arco alpino, in particolare nei settori centrali e orientali. Con il passare delle ore faranno la comparsa i primi temporali per poi estendersi nel pomeriggio e in serata su gran parte delle regioni di Nordest, benché a macchia di leopardo. Le pianure, dunque, non saranno risparmiate come ad esempio quelle dell'Emilia e del Triveneto, pronte a trasformarsi in teatro di fenomeni temporaleschi. Ma l'aspetto più preoccupante riguarda l'intensità di questi eventi atmosferici: oltre ai forti rovesci, all'intensa attività elettrica e a locali grandinate, si potrà verificare anche il fenomeno del downburst, un evento meteorologico caratterizzato da una forte e improvvisa corrente discendente di aria fredda durante un temporale. Quando questa corrente d'aria colpisce il suolo, si diffonde orizzontalmente in tutte le direzioni, provocando raffiche di vento molto potenti e potenzialmente dannose che possono essere scambiate come una tromba d'aria (o tornado). Mentre il Nord si prepara a questa seconda fase temporalesca, il resto d'Italia continuerà a godere del bel tempo. L'anticiclone africano manterrà la sua influenza su gran parte del Paese, garantendo ancora giornate di sole e temperature elevate. Una residua instabilità aprirà anche le porte del weekend destinato comunque a trascorrere in un contesto di rapido miglioramento condito inoltre da temperature un po' meno bollenti rispetto a questi giorni. ALLERTA METEO DELLA PROTEZIONE CIVILE Sulla base delle previsioni disponibili, il Dipartimento della Protezione Civile d’intesa con le regioni coinvolte, alle quali spetta l’attivazione dei sistemi di protezione civile nei territori interessati, ha emesso un avviso di condizioni meteorologiche avverse. I fenomeni meteo, impattando sulle diverse aree del Paese, potrebbero determinare delle criticità idrogeologiche e idrauliche che sono riportate, in una sintesi nazionale, nel bollettino nazionale di criticità e di allerta consultabile sul sito del Dipartimento( [www.protezionecivile.gov.it)](https://rischi.protezionecivile.gov.it/it/meteo-idro/allertamento/). E' stata inoltre valutata per la giornata di venerdì 2 agosto, allerta gialla sulla provincia autonoma di Trento, sul Veneto e sul Friuli Venezia Giulia. In queste zone sarà elevato il rischio di forti temporali con grandine e colpi di vento.",

    "text": "An avalanche on Mont Blanc has swept two skiers to their deaths and left another injured, while a hiker was killed on another slope in the French Alps, authorities said. The avalanche swept through an off-piste area of the Saint-Gervais-les-Bains ski resort on Thursday at an altitude of 7,545ft, the administration for the Haute-Savoie region said. Dozens of mountain rescuers set out to search for skiers who were trapped, finding a man and a women dead and another person injured. Five other people were rescued. An investigation has been opened into the cause of the avalanche. Saint-Gervais Mayor Jean-Marc Peillex said the weather conditions were too unstable for such risky outings. “It rained, it snowed, it was warm. There are enough marked paths to ski on,” he told BFM television. “It’s terrible what happened. A family is decimated, and we are very sad in Saint-Gervais.” To the north, a 31-year-old hiker was found dead after falling on the slope of the Ecrins mountain range. The hiker had veered away from hiking paths to look at mountain goats with a friend, local broadcaster France-Bleu cited rescuers as saying.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "Section Branding\nHeader Content\nActors, musicians, writers and artists we lost in 2023\nPrimary Content\nThe worlds of art, music, literature, film and more lost some of their most notable giants and geniuses in 2023. Here are just a few of the actors, writers, producers, artists and musicians who died in the past year, listed chronologically below by the dates of their deaths.\nFree-spirited icon of American rock David Crosby\nCrosby was a prominent figure of the 1970s Laurel Canyon scene who helped bring folk-rock mainstream with both\n The Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash. He developed a harmony-rich vocal approach and kaleidoscopic sound, which incorporated psychedelic rock, jazz and twangy folk. As a songwriter, Crosby's canon included the stormy classic \"Eight Miles High\" and \"Almost Cut My Hair\" from the hit album Déjà Vu. He died Jan. 18 at age 81. Read Annie Zaleski and Eric Westervelt's remembrance.\nBurt Bacharach, who composed an astonishing number of hits\nThe visionary pop composer wrote music that sounded simple. But there was nothing simple about the songs now seared in the memories of generations of listeners. They include \"I Say a Little Prayer,\" \"Walk on By,\" \"What the World Needs Now\" and \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.\" He died on Feb. 8 at age 94.\nRead Elizabeth Blair's remembrance.\nSage of the saxophone and visionary jazz composer Wayne Shorter\nThe 12-time Grammy-winning saxophonist and composer created some of the most singular sounds in contemporary jazz over more than half a century. From the hard bop of the late 1950s to genre-defying small-group jazz in the '60s all the way through the birth of rock-influenced jazz in the '70s, Shorter's soprano and tenor saxophones offered sonic clarion calls for change and innovation. He died on March 2 at age 89.\nRead Felix Contreras' remembrance.\nRyuichi Sakamoto, trailblazing godfather of electronic pop\nThe Japanese composer was one of the first musicians to bring electronic production into popular songcraft though his band Yellow Magic Orchestra. As a solo artist, he collaborated with the likes of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Sakamoto also scored such movies as Pedro Almodóvar's High Heels and Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, which earned him an Oscar, a Golden Globe and a Grammy. He died March 28 at age 71.\nRead Anastasia Tsioulcas' remembrance.\nRaghavan Iyer, an icon of accessible Indian cooking in the U.S.\nThe chef and author did much to popularize Indian cooking in non-South Asian kitchens through an approachable series of books that encouraged straying from traditional preparations. He also created a line of frozen dinners sold at Target. Iyer's final book, On the Curry Trail, was published just a few months before his death. He died March 31 at age 61.\nListen back to Iyer's 2023 interview with Ari Shapiro.\nDesigner Mary Quant, who styled London's Swinging '60s\nOne of the most influential designers of her era, Dame Mary Quant is credited with spreading the gospel of hot pants, miniskirts, colorful tights, waterproof mascara, baby wale corduroy, dresses with pockets, shiny PVC raincoats and Vidal Sassoon bobs. While only in her 20s, Quant opened a shop on Kings Road that evolved into a global fashion brand. She died April 13 at age 93.\nRead Neda Ulaby's remembrance.\nAhmad Jamal, who helped define American jazz for nearly a century\nOver eight decades of performance, jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal influenced everyone from Miles Davis to MacArthur Award-winning pianist Jason Moran. He recorded scores of records, including his 1963 crossover hit \"Poinciana,\" which stayed on the charts for 108 weeks. He died April 16 at age 92.\nRead Martin Johnson's remembrance.\nHarry Belafonte: singer, actor, activist and an EGOT for the ages\nEasily one of the 20th century's most charismatic performers, Belafonte won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award. In the 1950s, he set off a craze for calypso music with his chart-topping recording of \"Day-O\" (also known as \"The Banana Boat Song\"). Among other achievements, Belafonte helped organize the 1963 Freedom March on Washington. He died April 25 at age 96.\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/516446742/harry-belafonte-dead.\nIncomparable soul and rock powerhouse Tina Turner\nAn eight-time Grammy winner, Turner was known for her octave-defying voice and mesmerizing stage moves. In a recording career that spanned six decades, she found fame both as a solo artist and in a duo with her first husband, Ike Turner. Her story of surviving his abuse became the basis of the 1993 biopic What's Love Got to Do with It. She died May 24 at age 83.\nRead Annie Zaleski's remembrance.\nNPR correspondent Wade Goodwyn, known for keen storytelling\nThe Texas-based radio journalist reported on his home state for the better part of three decades. His top stories included coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing, school shootings,\n hurricanes, the American Sniper murder trial and the Boy Scouts sexual abuse scandal. Known for his soothing bass baritone, Goodwyn was widely admired by his colleagues. He died June 8 at age 63. Read Debbie Elliott's remembrance.\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon singer CoCo Lee\nShe was the Mandarin voice of the title character in Disney's animated movie Mulan and a hitmaker in three languages. The Hong Kong-born singer was a huge star in Asia. Lee recorded 18 studio albums and became the first person of Chinese descent to perform at the Academy Awards with her rendition of \"A Love Before Time\" in 2001 from the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She died July 5 at age 48.\nRead Chloe Veltman's remembrance.\nTony Bennett, whose silky voice epitomized the American Songbook\nBennett began as a suave crooner in the 1950s and quickly established himself as one of radio's most popular hit makers.

    "text": "With only a handful of days remaining until the end of the year, we are confident that 2023 will be the hottest year recorded in Texas.\nWhat You Need To Know 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded in Texas\nMany cities experienced their hottest summer on record\nHot afternoons and very warm mornings likely led to above-average temperatures, climate change likely the cause\nWhile it is too soon to tell if it will be just as hot in 2024, scientists say it is possible In an end-of-summer analysis , Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said the summer of 2023 was the second-hottest on record in the state with an average temperature of 85.3 degrees. This year fell short to the blistering summer of 2011 when the average temperature hit 86.8 degrees.\nFor some cities across the Lone Star State, this was the hottest summer on record. San Antonio experienced its hottest summer on record with an average temperature of 88.7 degrees. It also tallied the most triple-digit days at 64 and the most 105-plus degree days at 17.\nWe experienced no reprieve as we entered fall. In fact, many locations stayed hot through October. When you consider the steamy summer and warm end to the year, you have a historically hot year.\nBy the numbers Heat waves in Texas are becoming more common. In Corpus Christi, for example, eight of the ten hottest years on record have been since 2011. Nielson-Gammon says this summer’s extreme heat was evident in the triple-digit afternoon heat, but also in the mornings.\nAccording to The National Weather Service in Fort Worth , DFW broke its record for the longest duration of temperatures at or above 80 degrees this past summer. For 359 hours, North Texans couldn’t escape the heat.\nThe top five hottest years ever recorded at Dallas/Fort Worth International. While the summer of 2023 wasn't the hottest on record for the Capitol City, we were shy by only 0.1 degree from the hottest on record–2011. In many ways, 2023 looked a lot like 2011.\nThe top five hottest years ever recorded at Austin-Bergstrom International. For San Antonians, the average temperature for the year reached 73.0 degrees. This beats the previous record of 72.2 degrees set in 2006 and 1933. This previous summer was the hottest on record for the Alamo City. We hit the most triple-digit days at 64 and the most triple-digit days above 105 degrees at 17.\nThe top five hottest years ever recorded at San Antonio International. Is extreme heat expected in 2024? It is certainly possible.\nScientists will be paying close attention to El Niño . But this teleconnection that explains the relationship between the warmer waters of the equatorial Pacific and our weather in Texas is only one factor.\nTypically, El Niño brings more warmth to the Lower 48, but the current strong pattern isn't typical. With limited data and many other factors to consider, it's far too early to determine how hot the summer of 2024 will be or if it rivals the intense heat of the past year.\nOur team of meteorologists dives deep into the science of weather and breaks down timely weather data and information.

    "title": "Prabowo Subianto’s triumph opens a new chapter for Indonesia",
    "text": "Opinion\nPrabowo Subianto’s triumph opens a new chapter for Indonesia\nSpecial to Stars and Stripes March 7, 2024\nIn the sprawling archipelago of Indonesia, a nation cradling a mosaic of more than 17,000 islands, a pivotal moment has arrived. Prabowo Subianto, a figure long at the forefront of Indonesian politics, appears prepared to ascend to the presidency, having secured a majority of the votes in Indonesia’s recent election. The victory is not simply a personal achievement for the outgoing defense minister; it serves as a beacon of Indonesia’s democratic resilience and marks an opportunity for transformative leadership of a nation at a crossroads.\nThe electoral process, a testament to the robustness of democracy in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, has been both a marathon and a sprint. Over the past several months, Prabowo — the obvious heir to the immensely popular Joko Widodo — has traveled across Indonesia, visiting cities and villages to meet with individuals of all faiths, ethnicities and backgrounds — young and old, students and teachers, parents, professionals, soldiers, farmers, businesspersons and traders.\nWith almost 60% of the vote in, exit polls and sample counts point to a commanding lead for the presidential aspirant. To be clear, the official tally will require weeks — a period of anticipation that underscores the meticulousness of democratic procedure. What is certain is that, as of now, Prabowo is the indisputable victor, and he appears to have a demonstrable mandate from the Indonesian people.\nAn 83.5% voter turnout in the elections is a figure that resonates beyond mere statistics; it embodies the vibrant political engagement of the Indonesian electorate. By comparison, the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign saw American voter turnout levels soar to 62% of the voting-age population — a level not seen in decades.\nIndeed, Indonesia’s electoral participation is a victory in and of itself and demonstrates a collective commitment to shaping the Southeast Asian nation’s trajectory. That the elections occurred without unrest also punctuates the democratic foundations upon which Indonesia stands.\nOf equal importance is the mandate granted to Prabowo. Many interpret it as a clarion call for progress and an endorsement of his vision for Indonesia’s future. It is a future envisaged to be built on the pillars of national sovereignty, security and prosperity. Prabowo’s campaign has been characterized by a medley of engagements and interactions across the diverse nation. From the urban sprawl of Jakarta to the rice terraces of Bali, from the bustling markets of Surabaya to the beaches of Sulawesi, the presidential hopeful has presented a collective vision for Indonesia.\nThe election is perhaps the most consequential since the country first embraced democracy. Prabowo’s victory heralds a new chapter in Indonesia’s storied history, an opportunity to accelerate the ambitious reforms initiated over the past decade. Improvements aimed at modernizing the armed forces, bolstering economic justice, and ensuring national self-sufficiency are poised for a leap forward under the country’s new leader.\nAs he stated in a speech on the eve of his election, “We should not be arrogant. We should not be proud. This victory must be a victory for all Indonesian people.”\nIndonesia under Prabowo’s watchful eye is equipped to become a nation that is self-sufficient in energy, food and water; a society where millions are uplifted from poverty; and a democracy that is more open, vibrant and inclusive.\nWith Indonesia on the brink of this new era, the expectations of the incoming president are immense. But the collective will of the Indonesian people provides a strong foundation for the journey forward. Together, with a vision of unity and progress, Indonesia is capable of navigating the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, forging a path that not only defines its future but advances global democracy.\nNevertheless, reservations remain from some quarters.\nSome prominent scholars and their human rights counterparts remain troubled by Indonesia’s checkered human rights past, namely the transition to the New Order some 60 years ago and the violent purges that ensued.\nEven as these individuals acknowledge the “good ideas” outlined in the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership released by the White House last fall, some remain justifiably skeptical of a Prabowo presidency.\nWill he return to his sometimes-illiberal past, they wonder, or live up to his more recent pledges to pluralism and democracy?\nPrabowo will need to overcome this disbelief and remain committed to protecting the rights of indigenous people, the land and the environment. He will also need to tolerate dissent from human rights activists should they elevate their concerns during his tenure.\nBut there is reason for American officials to be optimistic.\nPrabowo’s victory constitutes an opportunity to deepen bilateral ties, advance the nascent U.S.-Indonesia strategic plan, overcome motivational distrust, and build an historic new era marked by Indonesia’s respect for democracy and pluralism and measures that advance joint security interests in the Indo-Pacific.\nAs one of my colleagues put it to me recently, “Indonesians love America … our media, culture, even our accents! But those who are informed are wary of our foreign policy.”\nStrengthening bilateral relations will take time, and it will require the suspension of cynicism.\nIn this moment of transition and hope, Indonesia reminds the world of the power of democratic choice and the potential for transformative leadership. Prabowo’s presidency will be a test, a challenge, and an opportunity to lead Indonesia into the future.\nIvan Sascha Sheehan is the associate dean of the College of Public Affairs and past executive director of the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Baltimore.
