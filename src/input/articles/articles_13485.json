    "text": "1 person dead, 1 missing after going through ice in Northern Ontario\nSearch efforts continued Thursday for one of two people seen going through the ice in the Northern Ontario community of Temiskaming Shores over the weekend, police said.\nOntario Provincial Police said someone reported seeing two people go through the ice at Pete’s Dam Park on Sunday afternoon, setting off a search that involved emergency response as well as underwater search and recovery units.\nOne person was found dead on New Year’s Day, police said. OPP said they do not publicly identify victims of accidental deaths but said the person who was found was the younger of the pair.\nAn online fundraiser on behalf of relatives said the two are a father and daughter.\nOPP spokesman Const. Martin Thibault said high currents and large amounts of rain have made the search particularly challenging.\nThe Office of the Chief Coroner and the Ontario Forensic Pathology Service have been called in.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 2, 2025.",

    "text": "As a childless former cat- and current dog-lady, I just want to say this to J.D. Vance: . This is clearly a man who traffics in stereotypes, including of his own supposed hillbilly people. (‘Cuz, you know, Yale law grads who run with venture capitalists and tech elites are s down with the working rural folks.) I guess, if he feels okay denigrating a community about which he is pretending to wax elegiac, he’s not going to hesitate to marginalize those of us who happen to be childless, whether by choice or biological constraint. And an animal lover he clearly ain’t. So, because I don’t have kids, and do have pets, I don’t have an investment in the future? Hmm. I guess I can stop donating to progressive candidates, environmental causes, and nonprofits that help other people’s children then. Because, you know, I don’t care about your kids or the future of life on earth, since I haven’t spawned my own DNA replicants. We all have an investment in every child’s future, because we are all better off when the economy is strong and our friends and neighbors are thriving. I have happily been paying my full allotment of taxes, much of which goes to school districts whose services I have not needed, for that reason. But because I’m taking care of animals and not birthing humans, I somehow owe society more and should pay more taxes for using fewer community resources? Again … puh-leez.",

    "text": "TEHRAN: Thousands massed Thursday in the Iranian capital for the funeral of senior Revolutionary Guards commander Razi Moussavi, three days after he was killed in what Tehran says was an Israeli strike. The crowd in Tehran’s central Imam Hossein square chanted “Death to Israel” and “Death to America”. Many waved yellow flags imprinted with the message “I am your opponent” — a reference to Israel — in both Persian and Hebrew. Israel has long fought a shadow war of assassinations and sabotage against arch foe Iran and its allies, but Moussavi’s killing in Syria came at a time of sharply heightened regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas conflict since early October. Some of the mourners in Tehran carried pictures of Moussavi together with the revered Qasem Soleimani, a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s foreign operations arm who was killed in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad. Iran next week will mark the fourth anniversary of the death of Soleimani, who had run the IRGC’s Quds Force for more than a decade. Iranian state media says an Israeli missile strike on Monday near the Syrian capital Damascus killed Moussavi, a Quds Force general and the most senior Guards commander killed since Soleimani. The Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said only that it does not comment on foreign media reports.
