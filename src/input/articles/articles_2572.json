    "text": "As the country continues to witness more success in the war against banditry, especially in the North West states, the Northern Elders Progressive Forum (NEPF) has commended tactics employed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led administration ahead of that of his predecessor, Muhammad Buhari. The group in a statement signed by its chairman, Dr Usman Sani, said the methods adopted by President Tinubu are working well when compared with the immediate past administration of Buhari. The statement further said that over 260 persons were rescued by the security agents within Sokoto, Zamfara and Niger states in the last month. “We commend the efforts of the Federal Government under President Tinubu on his genuine determination toward the fight against insecurity challenges facing our region, especially with the recent visit to the United States by the Honourable Minister of State, Defense, Dr Bello Mohammed Matawalle. “We are hoping it will yield a greater benefit and success in the war against banditry, criminal activities in the North West and the country in general. “We also commend the proactive measure taken by the Minister for State for Defence, in which he directed the Nigerian Army not to wait for any orders before going after bandits.” It will be recalled that the former governor of Zamfara State in a statement said, “We have directed our gallant troops to, henceforth, for the sake of urgency, identify and clamp on bandits’ enclaves even without ‘On-the-Spot’ order from what we called ‘The Top’, capture them on target and hit them heavily to the extent they could not have any hiding place in the bushes.” The statement further called on the Northern Governors, especially the affected states, to stop playing politics with the security of the lives of their citizens. It called on them to support the efforts of the President and his appointee in the fight against banditry and other criminal activities in the region.",

    "text": "Cryptocurrency re-surfaced with force in 2023, after a dismal two-year covid performance, reaching all-time high Bitcoin (BTC) prices of more than US$35,000.\nToday, Bitcoin is trading at more than US$42,000 at a maximum supply of 21 million coins, and there are predictions it could surge to new heights in 2024.\nBut what happened this year to propel this industry?\nThe Market Herald has compiled a list of some of the biggest stories to headline the crypto industry in 2023, with expert commentary from Investment Analyst Matthew Harcourt from cryptocurrency investment company\nApollo Crypto.\nMr Harcourt delves into the news headlines, trends and precedents that have set the trajectory for the industry as it heads into 2024.\nRegulatory landscape\nCrypto assets run on a technological platform known as a\nblockchain, enabling investors to confirm transactions without needing clearance from a central finance authority.\nThe platform itself is highly unregulated, however, this year there’s been heavy talk on how it can be regulated to increase financial security across the board.\nIn October this year, Australia saw some action with the Federal Government’s release of a proposal paper outlining recommendations to\nenhance the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n“Going into 2024, the regulatory crackdown is likely to shift from centralised exchanges to decentralised exchanges…,” Mr Harcourt explained.\nCentralised exchanges are controlled by one major entity, which means faster transactions and easier use. They act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers for higher liquidity.\nDecentralised exchanges offer lower transaction fees and allow users to hold onto their crypto assets, meaning they can avoid some of the regulatory burdens already in place.\n“…a little bit of worry is in the market about the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) trying to apply the old rule of law to these completely new technologies and businesses to sort of better their interests – which is pretty much what they did with centralised exchanges throughout this year…,” Mr Harcourt said.\nMr Harcourt said the crypto industry was geared to experience continual regulatory clarity from leading jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Europe and parts of the Middle East in 2024.\n“I suspect that the U.S. will continue to fight the industry and push innovation off-shore -as has been the trend for years,” he predicted.\nGrayscale and the SEC\nThis year, the world’s largest crypto asset manager,\nGrayscale, took the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the rejection of its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe legal dispute concluded with the SEC instructed to discard its initial rejection grounds. Grayscale emerged victorious, securing approval to launch the ETF.\nThe anticipated debut for the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF is now slated for January 2024, marking the first substantial deadline for filing denial.\n“Grayscale’s win in court shows that when the rule of law is fairly applied, the SEC will not be able to use its overwhelming power and resources in an unfair way,” Mr Harcourt said.\n“Going forward, it shows that the SEC will need to operate more fairly with the crypto industry as they will not be able to bully the industry the same way when in court.”\nCrypto crime crackdowns\nThe SEC has had its victories too.\nThis year, one of the wealthiest individuals to ever grace the crypto industry experienced his downfall. Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on fraud charges concerning his FTX crypto exchange.\nHis empire crashed in November 2022 at a value of $40 billion, along with his Alameda Research trading firm, forcing Mr Bankman-Fried to file for bankruptcy.\nMr Bankman-Fried is serving a maximum sentence of 115 years in a US prison.\nWithin weeks of that decision, the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was fined $50 million and stepped down as CEO after pleading guilty in a Washington District Court to violating US federal law.\nMr Zhao violated laws that require financial institutions to guard against money laundering and terrorist financing. He’s due to be sentenced early next year.\nBinance as a company pleaded guilty to wilfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act, knowingly failing to register as a money transmitting business, and willfully violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\nThe US Department of Justice alleged its platform accommodated criminals across the world who used Binance to move their stolen funds and other criminal proceeds.\n“Binance enabled nearly $900 million in transactions between U.S. and Iranian users,”\nThe Department of Justice Attorney General Merrick Garland reported.\n“And it facilitated millions of dollars in transactions between U.S. users and users in Syria and the Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.\n“For example, between August 2017 and April 2022, there were direct transfers of approximately $106 million in bitcoin to Binance.com wallets from Hydra, Hydra was a popular Russian darknet marketplace, frequently utilised by criminals, that facilitated the sale of illegal goods and services.\n“From February 2018 to May 2019, Binance processed more than $275 million in deposits and $273 million in withdrawals from Bestmixer. Bestmixer was one of the largest cryptocurrency anonymizing services in the world before it was shut down for money laundering.\n“Binance also did more than just fail to comply with federal law – it pretended to comply.\n“The message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal.\n“The Justice Department is requiring Binance to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and forfeiture.”\nSun charges hit celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan\nEarlier, in March, the SEC announced charges against crypto asset entrepreneur Justin Sun and three of his companies, Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation and Rainberry, for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT).\nThe SEC also charged Sun and his companies with fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRX through extensive wash trading, involving simultaneous, or near-simultaneous, buying and selling of a security, so it seems actively traded without an actual change in ownership. Interestingly it also laid charges around orchestrating a scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX and BTT without disclosing their compensation.\nThe SEC simultaneously charged the following eight celebrities for illegally touting the securities without disclosing their compensation – those celebrities included Lindsay Lohan. She was ordered to repay the US$10,000 she was paid to promote Sun’s TRX and BTT to her 8.4 million Twitter, or X, followers, plus a US$30,000 penalty.\nRecent reports suggest some platforms that Sun backed, including exchange HTX, had been hacked for well over US$100.\nSEC keeping watch\nWhen asked about his main concerns regarding crypto crime heading into 2024, Mr Harcourt said there were others in the industry that the SEC would be watching. For one, it has been trying to serve a lawsuit against Hex and PulseChain Founder Richard Heart.\n2024 predictions\nWhile Mr Harcourt said there was no way to know for certain if Bitcoin would edge even higher in 2024, the strong support for a Bitcoin ETF suggests the market is poised to see some positive action.\n“…if the macro picture stays favourable…I do think you’re going to get strong price action in Bitcoin and then that will flow onto the crypto market more broadly,” he said.\nMr Harcourt emphasised that Bitcoin ETFs could be a catalyst for institutional adoption, as they boast easy, safe and accessible investment characteristics for large companies.\nInternational crypto giant BlackRock also joined the ETF industry with an Ethereum fund under its iShares Ethereum Trust division. This was confirmed in early November through a listing on the NASDAQ.\n“…at the moment, there’s there’s a lot of hurdles from these internal compliance perspectives and so an ETF that’s created by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world … there’s no lower barrier to entry into buying Bitcoin than that institution, essentially,” he continued.\nLastly, Mr Harcourt touched on the utilisation of blockchain technology, by banks through what’s known as tokenisation. Tokenisation is the blockchain digital representation of assets.\n“Going forward you may start to see competition from other banks heating up in the tokenisation space, banks will also look to become crypto custodians,” he said.",

    "title": "Making Sure Employees Are Heard Will Shape The Future! – Supply Chain Game Changer™",
    "text": "The positive effects of giving employees a prominent voice and making sure employees are heard in the workplace have never been stronger. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen a balancing of power between employees and their managers.\nThe managers who have taken the time to listen to their teams’ concerns and opinions have seen exponentially greater benefits to the company than those who have continued on the traditional route of passively listening to their employees.\nFor a long time, it was standard for employees to feel powerless in their roles. Those at the lower levels of a company had little to no say in the organization’s decisions and actions. The new workforce is no longer accepting this as the status quo. With the realization that employees are not expendable, and that companies need them in order to survive – employees have been given a newfound power to speak up at their companies.\nNot only have employees realized their worth, but managers have also seen the benefits of actively\nlistening to their employees and acting on their concerns. Research into employee communication about job-related issues shows that it leads to greater employee engagement, better customer service, reduced turnover, and greater operational efficiencies.\nIn research completed by members of various Management Journals, results showed that employees who spoke up about a wide range of issues were 92% more likely to stay with the company. Furthermore, 95% of those who spoke up about all topics said they would recommend their company as a great place to work.\nCreating an Outspoken Environment\nCultivating an environment where\nemployees feel comfortable to speak about things happening at their company is vital to obtaining valuable feedback and insights from your team members. This not only allows employees to feel more engaged with their workplace, but it also exposes managers and executive-level employees to issues and concerns that they might not otherwise have known about.\nThe largest population in most organizations consists of the employees with the least power. These employees are the backbone of companies and without them, organizations would undoubtedly collapse. Therefore, it’s vital to give these employees a voice and take actions on their concerns – they know more about the company’s operations and processes than any c-suite executive could.\nCompanies have also begun implementing the use of innovative platforms to make communicating with their team members more accessible. One of the most prominent companies in the industry today is\nButterfly.ai, whose mission is to empower front-line and lower level teams to have their voice heard.\nManagers should consider implementing programs aimed at helping employees develop networks within the company and sharing a wide range of ideas. The individual talents of employees get magnified through the collective idea sharing between employees at all levels.\nAccording to a recent report generated by\nPGI.com, effective workplace collaboration can increase successful innovation by up to 15%. Employee collaboration leads to greater perspective, increases competence, and enhances productivity.\nManagers Need to Listen and Act\nCompanies need to train managers to be open to employee suggestions and take prompt action on those suggestions. Seeing managers take actions on their insights creates a culture where employees feel like they have some weight and power in their organization. This in turn creates more employee engagement and satisfaction within the company.\nIn research completed by various members of Manager Journals, 96% of employees who speak up about many topic areas within their company said they have managers who act based on their suggestions. By taking a more democratic approach to leadership, managers can not only increase their ability to make positive change, but also increase their team’s overall satisfaction with them.\nHowever, it’s important to emphasize that listening to your employees and acting on their advice are two different things. Just listening to your employees but disregarding their opinions can be very frustrating and result in more negative consequences than not listening to them at all.\nIf this is the case, employees will likely stop offering input and trust between managers and their teams will decrease. Managers need to provide tangible evidence that they followed up with their employees’ concerns and made real change.\nThe Costs of Silenced Employees\nWhen an employee feels silenced or that they have no impact on their company’s decisions, they turn to other behaviors that help them alleviate their concerns. These behaviors include complaining to others, doing extra or unnecessary tasks, ruminating about the problem,\nstaying away from work, or getting angry at their coworkers or those around them.\nAccording to a Harvard Business Review article by David Maxfield, the average cost of a silenced employee is $7,500. In the study conducted, a drastic 40% of employee respondents admitted to wasting two weeks or more sulking about an unresolved issue at their company. Every employee that feels disgruntled essentially adds a cost to the company’s bottom line.\nBe the Change you Want to See\nEncouraging employees to speak up, share concerns, and advocate for themselves produces an environment of happier employees, more positive workplace interactions, greater profits, and overall, a company that is destined to succeed.\nImplementing this change and making sure employees are heard can be the difference between a company that succeeds and a company that fails.\nMaking sure employees are heard article and permission to publish here provided by Simon Rakosi.

Montalvo Aznar, Bachiller en Teología y Profesor de Filosofía\nNo es seguro que haya muchos sabioteños que carguen en la actualidad sobre sus espaldas tanto peso como el del Cardenal Cobo, obispo tb. de Beatia. No es fácil identificar ninguna mayor gran esperanza blanca para el Pueblo de Dios en España, siendo como es la última esperanza postrera, el heredero simbólico del jamás aplicado aquí en lo sustancial Concilio Vaticano II. Su tarea es por tanto colosal pues para empezar no puede decir ni el nombre que tienen las piedras que mantienen desde hace décadas atascado el carro de todas las sinodalidades dignas de ese nombre en España, causa única de que su santidad nos considere de facto tierra demasiado hostil al Concilio en su cúspide como para visitarnos\nAPÚNTATE AQUÍ\nHace poco bromeaba quien escribe con un periodista acerca de cómo empezarán cuando se jubile las biografías que dentro de 20 años refieran el balance de su cardenalato y si entonarán la misma letanía de las fallidas esperanzas de una conciliar puesta al día de la nave de Pedro en España que van a suscitar las biografías del actual pontífice.\nVeamos una cristalina prueba de las extraordinarias capacidades de este hombre ordinario: Todos los entendidos refieren que quienes renuncian hoy fundadamente a cubrir las vacantes al episcopado en España son muchísimos más que quienes las aceptan. Pese a lo antedicho D. José obtiene logros sustantivos en los fichajes para su diócesis y tanto su curia como sus auxiliares se multiplican en adecuados relevos a modo de cosechas que abundan en presbíteros con cualidades muy por encima de la media en cuanto a su fidelidad al ya muy añejo Vaticano II. Es indudable y evidente tanto el olfato de D. José como su capacidad inspiradoray sobre todo alentadora frente al vértigo que cualquier presbítero avisado y sin necesidad de aplausos siente hoy en España cuando se le propone tanta visibilidad y tanta responsabilidad en un sociedad tan desacralizada y en una iglesia tan esclerosada como la hispánica.\nMutatis mutandi la humana esperanza de los ya tan desesperanzados laicos y eclesiásticos hispánicos, casi nos hace soñaral respecto con una feracidad que pudiera asemejarse a la de la fábrica de mitras organizada en la archidiócesis primada por Don Marcelo y sus discípulos. Y aquí está la mamá del cordero.\nEn tiempo ya de descuento respecto al actual pontificado veamos algún ejemplo de lo que nos aguarda y de porque los cuasisedevacantistas van ganando el partido gracias al árbitro filipino.\nEs perfectamente conocida la desesperación de la gran mayoría del sencillo pueblo de Dios y no digamos de sus “alejados” y de la mayor parte de los eclesiásticos de todos los géneros en diócesis españolas que llevan más de una década clamando en el desierto por un obispo con olor a oveja, frente a mitrados con nombramientos anteriores a Francisco. Se podría elucubrar o especular ingenuamente con que al llegar Francisco era muy violento incardinar en su diócesis algún obispo auxiliar sin el imposible placet del mitradoincluso en diócesis bien pobladas, de tamaño notable o bicontinentales (caso de Cádiz), o que pudiera resultar astringente para el titular nombrarle un administrador diocesano o un coadjutor (si fuera posible pues no soy canonista). Todo eso sería creíble si desde el año 2013 cuando es nombrado con altísimo consenso Francisco o en 2019 (en Octubre 6 años) fue nombrado ¿su? Nuncio se hubiera aprovechado la obligación del Código de Derecho Canónico de sin pausa posible acumular una cantera de candidatos. Pues nada de nada. No se ha movido un dedo para tener preparado a nadie cuando la edad lo hiciera inevitable en diócesis no pequeñas y arrasadas por la falta de un pastor vocacional como Cádiz-Ceuta o Córdoba).\nEs esta la prueba del algodón de queno se hace ni lo que se dice que no se puede, una sinodalidad plena que no llegue a lo que llorando esperan en Chile o Alemania, ni lo que en teoría si se podría en la CEE que vicepreside nuestro muy fundadamente respetado Cardenal de Madrid (la renovación del episcopado del norte y el sur americano si parece caminar a buen paso).\nLa pregunta es por tanto obvia ¿En términos históricos cómo va a empezar la biografía de D. José Cobo? O dicho de otra manera la generosidad que le conocemos ¿Da para seguir alentando a la cantera de su propia archidiócesis, hombre a hombre, hasta convertirla en “exportadora” en esta guerra de trincheras entre los amigos de la opacidad y la esclerosis y los amigos de la luz y de Francisco, es decir del evangelio?",

    "text": "¡Amiga date cuenta! Consejos para detectar red flags en tu relación amorosa COMPARTIR Si detectas una o varias de estas señales, platica con tu pareja y considera si vale la pena continuar. Las [red flags](https://vanguardia.com.mx/topic/-/meta/relacion), o banderas rojas, son señales de advertencia que indican posibles problemas en una relación amorosa. Ignorarlas puede llevar a conflictos emocionales y a relaciones poco saludables. Aquí te compartimos algunas red flags comunes y consejos para identificarlas y actuar.

Control excesivo y celos desmedidos Si tu pareja te revisa el teléfono, te cuestiona constantemente o intenta controlar a quién ves o con quién hablas, es una red flag clara. Este tipo de comportamiento sugiere inseguridad y la necesidad de ejercer poder sobre ti, lo cual puede afectar tu libertad y bienestar. Un vínculo saludable se basa en la confianza y el respeto, no en el control. 2. Falta de comunicación y respeto Una pareja que evita discutir problemas o minimiza tus emociones está generando una barrera emocional. Las relaciones sanas se construyen con comunicación abierta y comprensión mutua. Si tu pareja se burla de tus sentimientos o evita tener conversaciones difíciles, es una señal de que no se están valorando tus emociones. 3. Comentarios despectivos o manipuladores Las críticas constantes o los comentarios que te hacen dudar de ti misma son indicadores de [manipulación emocional](https://vanguardia.com.mx/show/el-matrimonio-de-angela-aguilar-y-christian-nodal-es-un-caso-de-love-bombing-segun-psicologa-DD13899864). Este tipo de comportamiento, conocido como gaslighting, busca hacerte sentir insegura sobre tus decisiones y percepción de la realidad. Una pareja que intenta cambiar quién eres o rebaja tu autoestima no te valora como mereces. 4. Inestabilidad emocional o cambios de humor repentinos Si tu pareja tiene altibajos emocionales extremos y esto afecta tu tranquilidad, puede ser una señal de que no sabe gestionar sus emociones. Las relaciones no deben ser una montaña rusa emocional; deben darte paz y seguridad. 5. Culpa y responsabilidad unilateral Otra señal de alerta es cuando tu pareja nunca asume la responsabilidad de sus errores y te hace sentir culpable por todo. En una relación sana, ambos se apoyan y reconocen sus fallas. Si sientes que eres la única que se esfuerza, es momento de reevaluar. Conclusión Estar atenta a las red flags es esencial para cuidar tu bienestar emocional. Recuerda que el amor no se trata de sufrir ni de tolerar comportamientos que te hagan daño. Si detectas una o varias de estas señales, platica con tu pareja y considera si vale la pena continuar. La relación más importante es la que tienes contigo misma; no temas poner límites y proteger tu paz.",
