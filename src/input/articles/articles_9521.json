    "title": "Cooper Flagg’s explosive athleticism was on display in Maine this weekend",
    "text": "Two years out from winning a gold ball with Nokomis and becoming the first freshman to win Maine Gatorade Player of the Year, Cooper Flagg made his first appearance with Montverde Academy back in his home state, putting on a show for thousands of fans at the Maine Event. Demonstrating the continued physical and instinctual maturity he has undergone at Montverde Academy, Cooper exploded for 26 points (64.7 percent shooting), 9.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 5.5 blocks per game against some of the country’s top talent, turning Portland into a frenzied basketball mecca for two straight nights. As the nation’s No. 1 basketball prospect regardless of class, all eyes are on Newport’s very own future Duke Blue Devil to succeed at the college level, and later as an NBA lottery pick. His explosiveness, instincts and versatility have been compared to the skillsets of Paul George , Aaron Gordon and Larry Bird , and this weekend Cooper proved that he’s just scratching the surface of what he could become. “I’ve had the good fortune of coaching a lot of guys picked high in the draft, and he’s every bit as much with the Cade Cunninghams, the Scottie Barnes and the Kyrie Irivings,” 13-year Montverde head coach Kevin Boyle said. “He’s on that path, no question — he could fall short, or go beyond.” Of his many traits, Cooper’s explosiveness was the most electrifying element in Portland this weekend. Whether it was his slam dunk three seconds into Friday’s game , his unbelievable alley-oops on Saturday or his 11 blocks on the weekend, Cooper easily won over the home crowd while striking fear into the opponent’s hearts. Practically able to reach the rim with his head when leaping flat-footed, Cooper made Gonzaga and CATS hesitant to drive to the basket on him — even with a numbers advantage in transition — and when combined with his quickness, he could easily make up for 4 to 5 feet of separation on catch-and-shoot jump shots. While less flashy yet equally as evident, Cooper’s high basketball IQ was on display in both games, passing when double-teamed and remaining communicative on defense. The 17-year-old was able to find the open man down low, and was very unselfish moving the ball around the perimeter — fitting seamlessly into Montverde’s offensive locomotive. Moreover, Cooper almost never turned the ball over, and only committed two fouls each game. Finally, Cooper also contradicted criticisms of his outside shot-taking and skill package, shooting 5-for-8 from beyond the arc and flexing his craftiness near the basket. Against CATS Academy, Cooper made three consecutive 3-pointers in the span of 90 seconds, accelerated into a pull-up bank shot from about 7 feet out, and contorted his way through two defenders for a crafty lay-up in the paint. “At his size growing up, you’re playing the center position all the time, but he’s got a lot more comfortable playing further away from the basket. He’s gotta get his handle a little tighter and shoot it more consistently to be an elite NBA player, and I think that will happen — he’s in the gym all the time and understands what he needs to do to get better,” Boyle said. “You gotta be a little selfish if you want to become a star-level player. But being selfish in his way is good, because it’s good for the team.”",

    "text": "हमीरपुर: उत्तर प्रदेश के हमीरपुर जिले से फिलिस्तीन समेत कई ऐसे देशों को फंडिग की जा रही है, जहां पर युद्ध चल रहे हैं या हाल ही में हुए हैं. ये फंडिंग एक NGO के जरिए की गई हैं. इसकी जानकारी लगते ही खुफिया एजेंसी अलर्ट हो गई हैं.\nबुधवार की रात लखनऊ पुलिस की एक स्पेशल टीम ने हमीरपुर पुलिस के साथ मिलकर मौदहा कस्बे में 7 लोगों से अलग-अलग पूछताछ की. इन 7 लोगों के मोबाइल फोन, बैंक लेनदेन और अन्य दस्तावेजों की लखनऊ की टीम ने गहन जांच की.\nखुफिया सूत्रों के अनुसार, सहारनपुर की एक महिला द्वारा मोबाइल स्टेट्स में मौदहा की संस्था का नाम लेकर विदेश में मदद पहुंचाने के लिए आभार जताया गया था. इसके बाद एजेंसियों की नजर इस नेटवर्क पर गई.\nसीओ मौदहा विनीता पहल ने बताया कि लखनऊ से आई टीम ने 7 लोगों से पूछताछ की है. एसपी हमीरपुर डॉ. दीक्षा शर्मा ने बताया कि टीम ने सात लोगों से पूछताछ करके उनके मोबाइल, दस्तावेज और बैंकिंग लेनदेन की जांच की है. मामला संवेदनशील है, जांच जारी है.\nटीम देर रात पूछताछ के बाद लखनऊ वापस चली गई. लेकिन, किसी को हिरासत में लेकर गई है या नहीं, इस पर अभी कुछ नहीं कहा जा सकता. पुलिस को शक है कि एनजीओ के जरिए युद्धग्रस्त देशों जैसे फिलिस्तीन आदि में आर्थिक मदद भेजी गई, जिसे डिजिटल माध्यमों से ट्रैक किया जा रहा है. मामला आईबी और एटीएस तक जा सकता है.\nये भी पढ़ेंः अबदुल्लाह आजम खान से 4 करोड़ 64 लाख की रिकवरी का आदेश; स्टांप ड्यूटी की चोरी से जुड़ा मामला",

    "text": "Cúcuta\nHay revuelo en el hospital Jorge Cristo Sahium luego de conocerse la decisión que tomo el alcalde de Villa del Rosario de apartar de su cargo al actual gerente de este centro asistencial Dubán Martínez, quien venía ejerciendo desde el 2020 en el municipio histórico.\nEl mandatario señaló que jurídicamente, el actual gerente debía salir meses atrás por una decisión emanada por la Supersalud y la cual no se había cumplido. “El gerente fue retirado y ya no es gerente, se argumentó jurídicamente, porque él debía haber salido desde abril y la Superintendencia hizo silencio administrativo; y la norma y la ley nos permite que cuando se hace un silencio en las normas o sentencias se debe retirar por la junta directiva”.\nEsta situación ha generado malestar entre los funcionarios y empleados del centro asistencial, que en las últimas horas han mantenido una protesta pacífica en la entrada del hospital, sin embargo, han señalado que continúan con la atención y los servicios que presta esta unidad médica.\nPor ahora el alcalde de Villa del Rosario Carlos Julio Socha, ha señalado que aún no tiene nombre del nuevo gerente del hospital, pero sin embargo esta decisión la tomaría antes del viernes 29 de diciembre, y lo posesionaría buscando dejar un gerente en firme antes de su salida\n“Yo voy a mirar quién queda encargado del hospital, debe ser algún miembro que está en carrera o de pronto un particular, creo que la norma me lo permite elegir el nuevo gerente, que creo que lo voy a posesionar el día viernes porque los tiempos me dan”.\nEn las últimas horas se dio vía libre a través de un decreto, donde se declaró abierta la convocatoria para que en un tiempo no máximo a dos días, se pueda nombrar un nuevo gerente en el hospital de Villa del Rosario haciendo el proceso de convocatoria y entrega de documentos del postulado con el fin de dejarlo posesionado antes de que termine su actual mandato.",

    "text": "ST. LOUIS — The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed that a man is facing charges after they say he targeted four chain retailers in just one night. Dorian Harris, 26, has been charged with four counts of second-degree burglary, two counts of stealing, two counts of second-degree attempted burglary, and 2 counts of first-degree property damage. Harris stole a total of $1,500 from the stores, police said. On Tuesday night around 9 p.m., police responded to a burglary at Rainbow located in the 3600 block of Page Avenue. Other SLMPD officers also responded to a call around 9:15 p.m. at Randall's Wine and Spirits located in the 1900 block of South Jefferson Avenue. Police said this was an attempted burglary. Early Wednesday morning just after midnight, more officers responded to another burglary at Kids Footlocker located in the 3600 block of Page Avenue near the Rainbow store. Then around 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, officers arrived at the scene of an attempted burglary at City Gear in the 3500 block of Bamberger Avenue. The initial investigation revealed surveillance footage that led police to Harris. Police said that Harris admitted his involvement in the burglaries. Missouri has requested pre-trial detention due to the nature of the offense and Harris' prior criminal history. In St. Clair County, Illinois, Harris has pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a stolen vehicle and aggravated fleeing. Police did not say if Harris acted alone in these burglaries.",
