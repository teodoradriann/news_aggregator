    "title": "Carson Beck explains decision to return",
    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE - The aftermath of Georgia's SEC Championship Game loss to Alabama hit Carson Beck hard.\nHe had waited three years to start at quarterback for Georgia, to play in a game of that magnitude. Now Beck saw devastation on the faces of teammates who knew they had come up short.\nThat feeling, that brotherhood with his teammates, combined with a definite sense of unfinished business, is ultimately what led Beck to return to Georgia for one more season.\n\"Seeing the emotions of the guys in that locker room, I was like, yeah, we've got to do this again, or I have to do this again,\" Beck said. \"I come back and you know, just have another season with these guys, and the bond that we've created is going to be something special.\"\nBeck said he knew in his heart he wanted to return a couple of days after the SEC Championship Game. He took his time speaking to his family and people he trusted to make sure everyone was on the same page.\nOffensive coordinator Mike Bobo is just one person whose voice was heard.\n\"We had been talking since the last ballgame about certain things,\" Bobo said. \"At the end of the day, it was getting him the information that he needed to make the decision. It wasn't some big announcement. It was kind of a culmination of things leading up to that point. My conversations with Carson mainly have been about still preparing and finishing the right way this season. That was his decision, a family decision that he made. I wanted to let him know I'm his coach and am going to support him any way possible that he needs.\"\nRunning back Kendall Milton is close with Beck, as both came to Georgia in the Class of 2020. His friend's demeanor after the loss to Alabama helped clue him in to Beck's decision.\n\"He just remained locked in,\" Milton said. \"He didn’t really talk about the next level, he didn’t talk about where he was training at, he didn’t talk about any of that stuff. He was really locked in to Georgia football and the program.\"\nBeck discussed many factors that played into his decision. In addition to the brotherhood with his teammates, Beck mentioned the unfinished business of not winning a national title and the enjoyment he gets from actually playing, after waiting so long for his turn.\nAs for NIL deals, Beck said those didn't play into his decision at all. He recalled seeing the same social media rumors as everyone else earlier this fall.\n\"Coach Smart's like, 'Where's this coming from?' I'm like, we haven't even talked about it. I haven’t even said anything. We haven't even talked about the decision,\" Beck said. \"But that was not one of the biggest factors in me coming back. Obviously, as the quarterback of Georgia, there's going to be plenty of opportunities outside of Georgia, you know, for me to make NIL and things like that. But for now, coming back and trying to win a championship with these guys and this team, it's so important to me. I know that's so cliche and that's what I'm supposed to say, but I truly believe that and mean that.”\nNow, Beck's focus is set to turn to next season following Saturday's Orange Bowl.\nHe will head into 2024 as one of the unquestioned leaders and voices of the team. Center Sedrick Van Pran sees that as a huge benefit. Beck can now take more command of the offense, continuing to develop timing with his receivers and discussing the best way for routes to be run.\nFor his part, Beck knows he can be much better. He admitted he sets sky-high expectations and is very critical of his own play.\n\"I definitely could have done a whole lot better,\" Beck said. \"There's so many opportunities left out on the field. So many decisions where I go back and watch on film, I'm like, I've done that 1,000 times, and how could I possibly mess that up?\"\nAn offseason of growth lies ahead. If Beck has his way, his Georgia career will end inside a locker room that will look much different than the despondent one in Mercedes-Benz Stadium earlier this month.\n\"I sat here for three years and didn't play,\" Beck said. \"Why would I not come back and take advantage of another opportunity to play on such a great team?\"\n ",

    "text": "As of: March 10, 2024, 9:21 p.m Comments Press Split At the beginning of Ramadan, Olaf Scholz comments in a video message. The Chancellor calls for social cohesion – and wants a ceasefire in the Middle East. Berlin – Chancellor Olaf Scholz is fighting for a longer-lasting ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. “It's best to do it during Ramadan,” said the SPD politician in a video message distributed on Sunday (March 10). “Such a ceasefire should ensure that the Israeli hostages are finally released and that more humanitarian aid finally arrives in Gaza,” emphasized Scholz. He is sure that the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians want peace. Scholz was saddened by the fact that Muslims in Germany were increasingly worried about cohesion. “After the reports about racist deportation plans by right-wing extremists, I keep hearing worried questions about the future,” he said. “I think our answer to this must be very clear: We will not allow ourselves to be divided as a country!” Citizens with and without a migration history belong equally to Germany. Ramadan begins: Scholz calls for a ceasefire in the Gaza war in a video message For devout Muslims, a week-long period of fasting begins this week on the first day of Ramadan. The exact date depends on the appearance of the new crescent moon and can therefore vary slightly from country to country. This year's fasting month will be overshadowed by developments in Gaza. Qatar, Egypt and the USA have been negotiating a temporary ceasefire in the Gaza Strip between Hamas and Israel for weeks. The mediators had hoped to reach an agreement by the start of Ramadan. In addition to a ceasefire, it is also about the release of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas. Scholz said that many people are thinking particularly about their relatives in the Middle East these days. “I want you to know: you are not alone in your compassion,” he emphasized. “Many people in Germany also share a great deal of interest - in the suffering of the murdered and abducted Israelis and in the fate of the innocently killed, the wounded and those suffering in Gaza.” (dpa)",

    "text": "FULLERTON, CA / ACCESSWIRE / January 19, 2024 / Amidst continual tensions in the Israel-Palestine conflict, Congressional candidate Cheyenne Hunt becomes the only candidate in her race to call for an immediate ceasefire and a renewed commitment to peace and diplomacy. Recognizing the deep-rooted complexities of this long-standing dispute, Hunt underscores the need for a resolution that respects the dignity and rights of all parties involved.\nCheyenne Hunt for Congress\n\"The situation in Israel and Palestine demands not just our attention but our empathy and understanding,\" stated Hunt. \"While we advocate for a ceasefire, it's crucial to acknowledge both the rights of Israel to engage in a targeted campaign against Hamas after the brutality of Oct. 7 and the rights of the Palestinian people to be free from violence, have their human rights upheld, and to have a path toward statehood. This conflict, with its tragic cycle of violence and suffering, calls for a solution that upholds international law and human rights.\"\nHunt stresses the importance of protecting civilian lives and addressing the humanitarian crisis that affects countless individuals in the region. \"In our pursuit of peace, we must ensure that the fundamental rights and welfare of the civilian population are at the forefront. The international community must come together to provide aid and support to those who are suffering.\"\nReflecting on the broader implications of the conflict, Hunt highlights the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach. \"Peace in the region is not just about negotiating a ceasefire. We must actively oppose extremism in all its forms, whether it's anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim sentiment or the dehumanization of any group.\"\nHunt's stance is rooted in a vision of a future where mutual respect and understanding pave the way for lasting peace. \"While the path to peace may seem daunting, it is our responsibility to strive for a world where future generations of Israelis and Palestinians can live in security and dignity. Let us commit to a discourse that prioritizes our shared humanity and the universal desire for peace.\"\nHunt remains committed to supporting diplomatic efforts and advocating for peace in the region.\nContact Information\nAnnika Albrecht\nannika@ripple-fx.com\n503-935-4504\nSOURCE: Cheyenne Hunt for Congress\nView the original press release on newswire.com.",

    "title": "UN Urges Israel to ‘End Unlawful Killings’ in Report Citing Rapid Deterioration",
    "text": "The United Nations released a report Thursday urging Israel to end “unlawful killings” in the West Bank, citing a “rapidly deteriorating human rights situation.”The report from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cited the use of heavy handed tactics by security officials leading to “arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of Palestinians” as well as “discriminatory movement restrictions.”“The UN Human Rights Office has verified the deaths of 300 Palestinians from 7 October to 27 December 2023 – including 79 children – in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” read a news release accompanying the report. Of those deaths, 201 involved no exchange of fire from the victim while 105 were caused by airstrikes and similar use of military force.“The use of military tactics means and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,” read a statement from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.“I call on Israel to take immediate, clear and effective steps to put an end to settler violence against the Palestinian population, to investigate all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli Security Forces, to ensure effective protection of Palestinian communities against any form of forcible transfer, and to ensure the ability of herding communities displaced due to repeated attacks by armed settlers to return to their lands.”The report documented the injury of 3,000 Palestinians by Israeli security forces, including “at least 355 children.” Israeli security often prevented the medical treatment of injuries by targeting Palestinian ambulances and paramedics or delaying their response.Additionally, Israeli military incursions were blamed for “extensive damage to civilian objects and infrastructure” in densely-populated areas, something also observed in Israel’s more highly-publicized operation in Gaza where at least 21,320 people have been killed, according to the latest figures from local officials.At least 4,700 Palestinians have reportedly been arrested in the West Bank, including some 40 journalists.The release documents the humiliation and brutal treatment of detainees: The report refers to the Palestinian territory west of the Jordan River, including East Jerusalem, which has been illegally occupied under international law by the Israeli military since 1967. Türk accused Israel of taking advantage of the situation since October 7 to accelerate the occupation of the West Bank, with both settlers and Israeli security forces engaging in violence against Palestinians.The rhetoric of Israeli officials has explicitly sanctioned the killing and displacement of Palestinians. “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba,” said Israeli security cabinet member Avi Dichter last month, referring to the Arabic word for “catastrophe” used to describe the forced displacement of Palestinians upon Israel’s founding in 1948. The Nakba led to the ethnic cleansing of some 500 Palestinian towns and villages and the killing of thousands.Israel has acted with apparent disregard for civilian life during its operation in Gaza, where some two-thirds of the dead are reportedly women and children. “A child is killed every 10 minutes. Pregnant women are undergoing C-sections with no anesthetics,” reported the organization CARE International recently, citing a “collapse of the water, sanitation, hygiene, and health infrastructure as fuel storages run out and major hospitals shut down.”Recently, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen announced the country would deny visas to UN staff members to protest the organization's criticism of Israel’s conduct. https://sputnikglobe.com/20231215/hersh-hamas-troops-surrendering-in-gaza-west-bank-crisis-is-next-tinderbox-1115609130.html https://sputnikglobe.com/20231213/us-reportedly-delaying-sale-of-m16-rifles-to-israel-over-west-bank-settler-violence-1115563559.html israel west bank east jerusalem",

    "title": "‘Graveyard of Coral’: Great Barrier Reef Suffers Reported Record Mortality",
    "text": "Planet Earth has far more than just seven Natural Wonders, but there’s been an admirable effort for humanity to protect the spots around the globe that have earned this prestigious title. On the list are America’s Grand Canyon, the Harbor at Rio de Janeiro in beautiful Brazil and of course, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. The underwater gem spans 1,400 miles of the ocean Down Under, and is widely known as the world’s largest living structure. Sadly, new research indicates that the once-colorful tourist attraction is rapidly changing with the effects of climate change.\nAustralia’s Natural Wonder Now Described as a ‘Graveyard of Coral’\nEarlier this week, researchers reported that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered “the highest coral mortality on record,” per CBS News. This comes after a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones and flooding in the area; in the last eight years, there have been five mass bleaching events which turn the Natural Wonder from its vibrant colors to a bland shade of white. This occurs as “water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive,” the outlet explains. If heightened temperatures persist, coral eventually turns white and dies off.\nIn their latest study, the Australian Institute of Marine Science surveyed 12 reefs and found up to 72 percent coral mortality. Specifically, a northern section of the reef showed that about a third of hard coral had died, marking the “largest annual decline” in the past 39 years of government monitoring. Acropora, a rapid-growing species reportedly has the highest death rate.\nWhen Will the Great Barrier Reef Die?\nHead of oceans at World Wildlife Fund Australia, Richard Leck, noted the 2024 surveys confirmed his “worst fears” about the situation. “The Great Barrier Reef can bounce back but there are limits to its resilience,” he explained. “It can’t get repeatedly hammered like this. We are fast approaching a tipping point.” Because the surveyed area is “relatively small” in comparison to the natural wonder’s full size, Leck expects that “similar levels of mortality” will be observed in the full report released next year.\nAccording to the expert, Australia’s need to commit stronger emission reduction targets is only reinforced by this news; he believes the country should aim for at least 90 percent below 2005 levels by 2035 while moving away from fossil fuels to help out Mother Nature. CBS notes that the tourist hotspot is “one of the world’s largest gas and coal exporters and has only recently set targets to become carbon neutral.”\nFor now, the future of the World Heritage Site depends largely on how the nations surrounding it choose to move forward. “The Great Barrier Reef is not dead. Nor is it in good health. The truth is complex. To understand what’s going on takes more than a headline,” the Australian Institute of Marine Science wrote in mid-2023. That year, they noted a “rebound” in the Reef, but pointed out that, “We’re heading towards a future where hotter water temperatures will likely cause bleaching every year, along with ongoing threats of cyclones and coral-eating starfish. Recovery requires reprieve – and those opportunities will diminish as climate change progresses.”",
