    "text": "F1 fans mocked as NASCAR superstar says they give off 'princess vibes'\nF1 fans mocked as NASCAR superstar says they give off 'princess vibes'\nNASCAR superstar Kyle Busch has issued a scathing assessment of Formula 1 fans, claiming that those going to the races do so to be noticed, not for the racing itself.\nF1 is no stranger to the world of luxury. As the pinnacle of motorsport racing, it attracts the biggest stars from the world of music, fashion, film and so much more.\nThe sport travels the world, racing around the globe at iconic circuits and venues; when F1 comes to town, you know about it.\nYet in the US, NASCAR is king. F1 now holds three races in the States (Austin, Miami and Las Vegas) – but the sport is not as popular.\nBusch, 39, is regarded as one of the greatest ever drivers to compete in the sport – and he believes that F1 and NASCAR are worlds apart.\nKyle Busch: F1 gives off 'princess' vibes\n“Culture,” Busch replied when asked what the biggest difference was between NASCAR and F1 on Bert Kreischer’s Something’s Burning.\n“We’re a bunch of rednecks that run in circles and they're a bunch of sophisticated engineers and smart people that turn right and turn left,\" he said.\nAs host Kreischer referenced the glitz and the glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix, Busch agreed with his take that 'most people who go aren't even fans'.\n“It's kind of like going to the Super Bowl and going to all the Super Bowl parties,\" Busch added. \"You just want to be seen.\"\n\"They [NASCAR fans] want to go to see NASCAR and and spectate it and witness it and be a part of it.\n“F1 reminds me a little bit of like the Kentucky Derby. All the girls got to wear the hats. They got to dress in the dresses you know – princess vibes.”\nTopic starts at 27:44\nF1 HEADLINES: Verstappen in transfer proposition as Hamilton tipped to LEAVE Ferrari\nRelated\nDrivers\n-\nLewis Hamilton -\nCharles Leclerc -\nLando Norris -\nOscar Piastri -\nJack Doohan -\nPierre Gasly -\nYuki Tsunoda -\nMax Verstappen -\nAlexander Albon -\nCarlos Sainz -\nAndrea Kimi Antonelli -\nGeorge Russell -\nOliver Bearman -\nEsteban Ocon -\nFernando Alonso -\nLance Stroll -\n[Gabriel Bortoleto](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/gabriel-bortoleto/) -\n[Nico Hülkenberg](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/nico-hulkenberg/) -\n[Isack Hadjar](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/isack-hadjar/) -\n[Liam Lawson](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/liam-lawson/)\nRaces\n-\n[Grand Prix of Australia 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/australian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of China 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/chinese-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Japan 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/japanese-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Bahrain 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/bahrain-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Saudi Arabian Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/saudi-arabian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Miami Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/miami-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Gran Premio dell'Emilia Romagna 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/gran-premio-dell'emilia-romagna-2025) -\n[Grand Prix De Monaco 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/grand-prix-de-monaco-2025) -\n[Gran Premio de España 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/gran-premio-de-espana-2025) -\n[Grand Prix du Canada 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/grand-prix-du-canada-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Austria 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/austrian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Great Britain 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/british-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Belgium 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/belgian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Hungary 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/hungarian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Dutch Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/dutch-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Italy 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/italian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Azerbaijan 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/azerbaijan-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Singapore 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/singapore-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of the United States 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/united-states-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Gran Premio de la Ciudad de Mexico 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/gran-premio-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico-2025) -\n[Grande Prêmio de São Paulo 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/grande-premio-de-sao-paulo-2025) -\n[Las Vegas Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/las-vegas-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Qatar Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/qatar-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-2025)\nAbout GPFans\nGPFans is a multi-platform, multi-language brand dedicated to Formula One coverage.

    "text": "2 weeks ago\nThis latest update with the new sounds seems to have majorly broken wifi - my Google Homes are constantly getting disconnected from wifi.\nEvery other device is completely fine and working great. It would be great if Google could either add a trigger to search for wifi when the \"sorry, I can't fine the network\" error is triggered, or add a way to reboot the Homes without requiring me to unplug the damned things.\n2 weeks ago\nAfter rebooting, they continue to work normally, until at some arbitrary point they feel that the wifi no longer has that.. je ne sais quoi quality, and decided to disconnect from the world like a college student traveling to Europe.\nFriday\nHi Midnitte,\nThank you for posting in the community. I'm sorry that you're experiencing troubles with Wifi disconnections with your Google Home devices. I understand how frustrating this can be. I'm here to help.\nBefore I begin, I need to ask some questions for further assistance:\nIn the mean time, some suggested steps to check the Wi-Fi network for your speaker or display to follow:\nPlease keep me posted. I'll look forward to your response.\nRegards,\nByron\nTuesday - last edited Tuesday\nThis is not isolated. I have 4 google homes 3 home (living room 3ft from router, bathroom, and bedroom 3 feet from mesh) and a home max in the kitchen. The home 3 feet literally from the router multiple times a day says \"I can't find the the wifi network please check your router.\" The same for the bedroom and bath room homes twice a day. The home max in the kitchen never has a problem and its the furthest away. This just started a few week ago and it's maddening!!! Nothing else has a problem, just Google Homes, Router and Wifi are exactly the same. This is INCREDBILE FRUSTRATING!! It is something Google pushed in its code! The only thing that fixes this is unplugging the Homes and re-plugging them into the electricity.\nyesterday\nHi GameTheory,\nThank you for reaching out to the community. I'm sorry that you're having troubles with the connections of your Nest Homes. I understand how frustrating this can be. I'm here to help.\nBefore I begin. I need to ask a few questions for better assistance:\nIn the meantime, please try the following:\nSet up a temporary mobile Wi-Fi hotspot.\nPlease keep me posted. I'll look forward to your response.\nRegards,\nByron\n2 hours ago\nHow long did the device work before the connectivity situation started? Many many years (5+) for the three Google Homes.\nHow was the connectivity situation discovered? The 3 Google Home say \"I cannot find the Wi-Fi network please check your router.\"\nDid the device give any visible or audible error? See previous answer.\nHow long did the situation persist before it started to work again? It never resolves itself and after a few hours I unplug the Home and plug it back in again and it works fine immediately after but the problem will come back later in the day.\nHow many times have you experienced this situation? 3 Google Homes have this issue and they each had it 2 times today so I had this happen 6 times in one day!!! One of them sits three feet from the WiFi & router.\nNo other Google devices have this problem. I have 2 Nest Cams and a Nest Audio and they never have problems and no other devices have issues either.",

    "text": "Rockets Fall to Grizzlies in Comeback Win\nThe Houston Rockets fell 120-119 to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies ended on a 13-4 run.\nHouston's offense started slow to begin the first quarter, but they amped it up to get a small two-point lead before Memphis tied it at 28. After calling a timeout with just over two minutes to go in the first 12 being played, Ime Udoka put in a fast-paced lineup of Amen Thompson, Jalen Green, Cam Whitmore, Tari Eason, and Jock Landale. The five helped the Rockets acquire their biggest lead of the game as they ended the period up 38-33. Dillon Brooks was great to start the game, scoring 10 in 10 minutes.\nThompson hit two midrange shots in the beginning of the second quarter before stealing the ball and getting fouled on a layup, in which he made both free throws. The forward continues to show improvement in the arsenal of his midrange shot as he shoots more every game. He immediately blocked Luke Kennard on the other end. Houston's offense started steamrolling in the second quarter, due to Thompson scoring nine points in the first five minutes. Green had 15 points at halftime and Thompson had 14. The Rockets ended the quarter on a 9-3 run, leading 66-56 at the half. Shooting played a factor in the score due to Houston shooting 47.1% from three and Memphis shooting only 15.4% from three.\nUdoka called a timeout less than two minutes into the second half after Kennard made two threes for Memphis to help them go on an 8-0 run. Santi Aldama was able to lead the Grizzlies to a one-point lead with just over four minutes to go left in the third quarter. After a shootout, Houston went up by two points, causing Memphis to call a timeout. The Rockets were able to gain a small lead over the Grizzlies, going up 96-92 at the end of the period.\nThe Rockets went on an 11-2 run midway through the fourth quarter to put them up by eight. Memphis was, once again, able to cut the lead down to just one point. Houston called a timeout up 119-118 with 25.9 seconds left to play. Jaylen Wells scored a wide-open layup, but the referees thought Taylor Jenkins called a timeout. His layup did not count and Memphis got the ball. Jaren Jackson Jr. was fouled and sent to the free throw line, where he made both free throws to put the Grizzlies up 119-120.\nThe Rockets take on the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday at Toyota Center. Tip-off is set for 7:00 p.m. CST.\nWant to join the discussion? Like Rockets on SI Facebook and follow us on Twitter to stay up to date on all the latest Rockets news.

    "title": "Parents ask for medical cannabis to treat children with severe epilepsy – but are offered brain surgery by the NHS first",
    "text": "The NHS has offered children with severe epilepsy brain surgery before medicinal cannabis, parents have revealed. Several families have told the Mail that their children were offered the “incredibly invasive procedure” which involves separating one side of the brain from the other and can cause vision loss. One mother refused the operation, which costs the NHS up to £33,400, and requested medicinal cannabis oil, which was legalized five years ago and has been shown to be effective with epileptic children. The oils are given orally every day and three children in the UK have NHS prescriptions, with successful results. But other young people with similar conditions have been denied, leaving parents paying up to £2,000 a month to obtain the medication privately, while others cannot access it at all. Luci Griffin’s son Alfie, 13, (pictured together) was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy six years ago and the family have so far been denied medicinal cannabis on the NHS. But last year doctors offered to perform a hemispherotomy on Alfie, which would involve temporarily removing a piece of his skull to operate on his brain. The family are currently purchasing highly concentrated CBD oil online, which costs them £300 a month, but Alfie’s condition is not improving. He can no longer go to school and Mrs Griffin has had to stop working to become a full-time carer (concentrated cannabis oil file photo) Luci Griffin’s son Alfie, 13, was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy six years ago and the family have so far been denied medicinal cannabis on the NHS. But last year doctors offered to perform a hemispherotomy on Alfie, which would involve temporarily removing a piece of his skull to operate on his brain. The family said they were warned this was “life-threatening”, that Alfie could lose his peripheral vision and would need weeks of rehabilitation to learn to walk again. Mrs Griffin said: “I don’t want to have to go to him and say we know it didn’t work… I want to say we’ve done everything we could, Alf, we did everything we could, why not do it?” Try medical cannabis first? The family, from Peterborough, have been refused Epidiolex on the NHS and private clinics that prescribe other oils cannot help. In October, the Mail revealed that two families were smuggling cannabis oil from the Netherlands in suitcases, as the pharmacy that supplied their private prescription did not have enough stock. Ms Griffin said obtaining the drug privately may not even be an option as they would struggle to keep up with the large monthly payments. ‘Even if we could (get it privately), how long can we sustain £2,000 a month? Not for long because we would have to sell the house,” the mother said. The family are currently purchasing highly concentrated CBD oil online, which costs them £300 a month, but Alfie’s condition is not improving. He can no longer go to school and Mrs Griffin has had to stop working to become a full-time carer. She said: ‘We are absolutely stuck. They were alone. “We have no support.” Families say they pay between £400 and £2,000 a month to obtain medical cannabis privately (file photo of scientist checking hemp plants in a greenhouse) The Mail has spoken to two other families whose epileptic children were offered brain surgery. “You can’t reverse brain surgery, so it seems crazy,” one mother said. Caroline Gisbourne’s 16-year-old son Mitchell underwent the procedure before medical cannabis was legalized in 2018, but it didn’t work and he is now using the oils successfully. She said: “If I had known about medicinal cannabis oils before, there would be no way to put him through the operation.” Brain surgery costs to the NHS depend on the age of the patients and the complexity of the procedure, but typically range between £7,800 and £33,400. Families say they pay between £400 and £2,000 a month to obtain medical cannabis privately. A spokesperson for NHS England said: “The decision to proceed with surgery… would be made jointly by a clinical team and the patient’s family and/or carers.”",

    "text": "Former Harlem star Kadin Bergstrom earns national honor with Rockford University baseball [Jay Taft](/staff/6053112002/jay-taft/) Kadin Bergstrom, a sophomore infielder at Rockford University and a former Harlem Huskie, became the first Regents first baseman selected to the D3baseball.com Team of the Week after he extended his streak to five straight games with a home run on Saturday. Bergstrom homered over the left-field fence in the top of the ninth during a 7-1 loss for his fourth homer of the week, and his school-record-setting fifth straight game with a round-tripper. And although his streak came to a close when he went homer-less in a doubleheader split with Concordia Chicago on Wednesday, he had already done enough to make the prestigious [D3baseball.com Team of the Week](https://d3baseball.com/landing/index). Bergstrom is the first Regent baseball player to be named to the D3baseball.com Team of the Week since 2022. More Rockford University sports: [Rockford University's one-legged baseball player 'fell in love with the game'](/story/sports/college/baseball/2023/04/13/rockford-universitys-one-legged-baseball-player-fits-right-in/70077047007/) On the week, he had three multi-hit games and two three-hit performances, homering in all four games to extend his streak to five straight games with a home run. Bergstrom went 6-for-9 with three homers, a double, six RBIs and six runs scored just in Rockford's sweep of Wisconsin Lutheran on April 9. He then went 3-for-7 with two more home runs, two RBIs and two runs scored at Concordia Wisconsin last Saturday. For the week he hit .563, slugged 1.563, had five home runs, a double, eight RBIs and eight runs scored. Bergstrom went 0-for-3 in Saturday's first game of the doubleheader to snap his homer streak. However, Joseph Stagowski went 3-for-4 and blasted two homers, including a walk-off solo homer run in the 6-5 win. The Regents are getting hot at the right time, posting wins in five of their last eight games. The 6-foot-3, 240-pounder, Bergstrom, is now hitting .318 with eight homers, four doubles and 21 RBIs while slugging .632. Bergstrom and Rockford (11-17, 7-7 NACC) will next host a doubleheader against St. Norbert on Saturday. The Regents play their home games at Pohlman Field in Beloit, Wisconsin.

    "text": "TORONTO — Commuters across the Greater Toronto Area and parts of eastern Ontario had to contend with blowing snow and slippery sidewalks while heading home Friday evening as a blast of wintery weather hit parts of the province. Environment Canada has placed a region stretching from Hamilton all the way east past Kingston, Ont., under snowfall warnings, saying it was predicting up to 15 centimetres of snow. The weather agency says the snow is expected to continue into the evening and then is set to taper off from west to east late in the night. It warns the snowfall could have \"significant impact\" on the evening commute, making for low visibility and potentially slick roadways. Environment Canada has said peak snowfall rates of two centimetres per hour are possible. It says surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. The agency says people should be ready to adjust their driving with changing road conditions. It says drivers should turn on their lights and maintain a safe following distance if visibility is reduced while driving. Other parts of Ontario, including Windsor and London, are under a weather advisory, with between five and 10 centimetres of snow in the forecast.
