    "text": "Copyright-Hinweis öffnen/schließen © APA/AFP/PATRICK T. FALLON Die Arbeiter waren rund eine Stunde in dem Abwassertunnel eingeschlossen. Warum der Tunnel eingestürzt ist, ist noch unklar. 10.07.25, 10:14 Kommentare Zusammenfassung Wir nutzen künstliche Intelligenz, um Zusammenfassungen unserer Artikel zu erstellen. Jeder Text wird vor der Veröffentlichung von einem Redakteur geprüft. 31 Arbeiter wurden nach einem Tunneleinsturz in Los Angeles ohne sichtbare Verletzungen gerettet. Der Einsturz ereignete sich in einem Abwassertunnel im Bau, 30 km südlich von Los Angeles. Mehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren im Rettungseinsatz, während die Ursache des Einsturzes weiter untersucht wird. Aufatmen in Kalifornien: Nach dem Einsturz eines Tunnels im Großraum von Los Angeles hat die Feuerwehr alle Eingeschlossenen geborgen .\n31 Menschen , wohl alle Tunnelarbeiter, seien am Mittwochabend lebend und ohne sichtbare Verletzungen gerettet worden , teilte die Feuerwehr mit. Der Unglücksort befindet sich etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.\nDutzende Bauarbeiter befanden sich in dem über zehn Kilometer langen Tunnel, als sich unterirdisch tonnenweise Erdreich ablöste. Den Arbeitern gelang es jedoch, über die losen Erdschichten zu klettern. In Gruppen wurden sie anschließend mit einem Tunnel-Fahrzeug zum Zugang geschleust. Danach wurden sie durch einen Kran in einer sogenannten \"bird cage\"-Kabine an die Oberfläche gebracht.\nEtwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News.\nGroßer Rettungseinsatz Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten. Mehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz ereignete sich acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt.\nIn beliebtem Touristengebiet: Flussbrücke eingestürzt, mehrere Tote befürchtet Der Tunnel ist insgesamt mehr als elf Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit. Das Tunnelprojekt mit etwa 630 Millionen Dollar Gesamtvolumen dient der Modernisierung der kommunalen Abwasserinfrastruktur. So sollen alte Leitungen aus den Jahren 1937/1958 ersetzt werden. 2028 will man betriebsbereit sein.\nDie Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.\n(Agenturen, sif) | 10.07.2025, 10:14 Kommentare",

    "title": "Oasis Date debuts as world’s first regenerative organic certified date farm",
    "text": "Medjool date producer and processor Oasis Date launched today, effectively becoming the world’s first and only regenerative organic-certified date farm. FreshFruitPortal.com sat down via Zoom with CEO Adam Cooper to discuss future strategies and opportunities for the date category.\nThe newly formed company has a significant scale and vertical integration through its over 5,000 farmed acres of organic Medjool dates and a 500,000-square-foot processing footprint. Oasis is also the majority supplier to Natural Delights , which enjoys category leadership in sales and distribution.\nWhile the Oasis Date name may be new, the farming and processing businesses on which it was built have operated for years, the firm stated in a release.\nCooper was hired from The Wonderful Company, where he spent over eight years leading marketing for Wonderful’s multi-billion-dollar portfolio of iconic brands, such as Wonderful Pistachios.\nRegarding this experience, the executive said that he had the \"great fortune\" of learning directly from Lynda and Stewart Resnick’s visionary leadership on how to build successful produce brands and businesses.\n“I learned about the importance of building great brands by doing what's right, and focusing on what those brands stand for, and what is the unique selling proposition of those brands,” Cooper told FreshFruitPortal.com.\nMedjool dates have gained popularity as a natural sweetener, and they can also be added to appetizers, meals, or baked goods. However, Cooper feels that the date category is currently “tremendously underserved, ripe for disruption and growth”.\n“Dates have a tremendous unique selling proposition. They are sweet treats with a great, wide range of health benefits. Dates have been around for millennia, yet in the U.S., they're fairly nascent. And I think that gives us a tremendous platform with what we're doing with Oasis Date to build this over time,” Cooper emphasized.\nMedjool dates have a rich cultural significance among Muslims, as the fruit is widely enjoyed to replenish the body after fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. With its launch, Oasis seeks to create more \"usage occasions\", Cooper said, adding that the cultural ties this product has with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine are some of the key aspects that drove him to board the company.\nAs for consumer awareness strategies, Cooper said Oasis is eager to build a balance between the brand’s voice and communicating the ample health benefits of the product.\n“We hear trend reports from retailers, from consumer publications talking about why dates are great and why Medjool dates in particular are great. And we're the leader of Medjool dates. And so we want to start finding ways of building the health equity of Medjool's to give people more reasons to buy Medjool's,” he stressed.\nEnvironmental commitment A major tenet of Oasis Date is a commitment to farming practices that “nurture the environment and support its people,” the company pointed out. As an important proof of that intent, the firm is the world’s first and only Regenerative Organic Certified date farm.\nThe Regenerative Organic Certification, established in 2018, is widely acknowledged as the highest standard for sustainability in agriculture.\n“We believe it's important that we create an ecosystem that is survivable and sustainable over time. For us, it starts with organic farming practices. We use natural compost and very efficient irrigation systems. It's also about the people, ensuring that we have fair wages. And it's about tracking and making sure that we're always getting better,” Cooper pointed out.\nGrown in Southern California and Southwest Arizona under strict regenerative agriculture practices, Oasis' dates can be enjoyed year-round thanks to the firm's distribution network in North America.\n\"There are certainly spikes in demand, just like any product. It's often around celebratory moments, which I particularly love because it's something that brings people together,\" Cooper said.",

Israel has stepped up attacks across the length and breadth of Gaza, targeting Beit Lahiya, Khan Younis, Rafah and Maghazi on Thursday despite global outrage and calls for a ceasefire amid the mounting death toll. Palestinians in the besieged enclave said they have [nowhere safe](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/where-should-we-go-palestinians-unprepared-as-israel-bombards-gaza) to flee.

More than 55,000 Palestinians have been wounded since Israel launched a military offensive in the wake of Hamas attacks on October 7 in southern Israel, which killed nearly 1,200 people – the country’s deadliest attack since its founding in 1948. Israel’s assault on Gaza has become one of the most destructive in modern history, enacting an enormous humanitarian toll and drawing accusations of a campaign of [collective punishment](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/10/israel-cannot-carry-out-collective-punishment-of-people-in-gaza-lavrov) against Palestinian civilians. An Israeli official on Thursday blamed the high death toll in the Christmas Eve attack on the Maghazi refugee camp [on improper munitions](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/28/israel-says-improper-munitions-cause-of-high-death-toll-in-maghazi-attack). More than 70 people were killed in the attack, which caused a global outrage. Nearly three months into the fighting, Hamas fighters continue to put up stiff resistance against Israeli forces, including in northern Gaza, where continuous Israeli strikes have left the area unrecognisable. An Israeli siege has also severely restricted [access to food](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/entire-gaza-population-facing-hunger-crisis-famine-risk-un-backed-report), fuel, water and electricity, and UN officials have said an estimated 25 percent of people in Gaza are starving. “It’s already hard enough as it is, finding your daily meal, finding drinkable water, with this amount of people gathered in one city,” Gaza resident Mohammed Thabet told Abu Azzoum after the strike in [Rafah](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/freezing-in-rafah-a-gaza-familys-war-time-displacement-and-hopes-for-2024). “Being this close to the Egyptian border in the far south of the Gaza Strip, people feel like they have nothing else they can do, like you just have to wait and hope for the best.” Asked if he felt safe in southern Gaza, Thabet said, “After everything we saw, not at all. There is nowhere safe in Gaza.” The United States has played an [indispensable role](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/a-biden-netanyahu-rift-distraction-palestinian-rights-advocates-say) in Israel’s war, providing it with [weapons packages](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/26/biden-seeks-to-expand-israeli-access-to-us-weapons-stockpile) and strong diplomatic support as Israel comes under growing pressure to bring the fighting to an end. Israel has promised to press on, widening its offensive and pressing farther south into areas where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge.",

    "text": "Liverpool, rimonta show nel Boxing Day: tris al Leicester, Salah brilla, Slot in fuga I Reds si aggiudicano la sfida interna contro la formazione di Van Nistelrooy e consolidano il comando della classifica 26.12 .2024 23:57 3 min\nLiverpool Leicester Premier League © Getty Images\nVince ancora il Liverpool, che dopo avere travolto il Tottenham nell'impegno di campionato precedente, si aggiudica la sfida interna contro il Leicester valida per la 18ª giornata di Premier League. Ad Anfield, gli uomini di Arne Slot si impongono con il finale di 3-1, recante le firme di Gakpo (45'+1'), Jones (49') e Salah (82') : a segno per gli ospiti Ayew (6') . Un risultato che consente ai Reds di consolidare il comando della classifica, con la complicità del Fulham che a Stamford Bridge ha sconfitto in rimonta il Chelsea di Enzo Maresca . Il divario con i Blues è ora di 7 punti , e può aumentare ancora considerato il derby con l'Everton da recuperare. L'agenda del Liverpool ha in programma le sfide di campionato contro West Ham e Manchester United - uscito sconfitto dalla trasferta contro il Wolverhampton - e a seguire il ritorno di Carabao Cup contro gli Spurs. Per Van Nistelrooy si tratta invece della 3ª sconfitta consecutiva dopo quelle contro Newcastle e Wanderers. La prossima giornata c'è il Manchester City, con un Guardiola sempre più impantanato nella crisi .\nIl racconto della partita Avvio di gara in salita per il Liverpool, che passa in svantaggio al 6' minuto di gioco, quando Mavididi serve Ayew che da centro area batte Alisson . I padroni di casa si lanciano allora a caccia del pareggio, sfiorando il gol al 24' con il colpo di testa di Robertson che si infrange sul palo. A firmare l'1-1 ci pensa allora Gakpo con un destro da fuori al primo minuto di recupero. Nella ripresa, non passa molto che i Reds passano in vantaggio con Jones , servito sotto porta da Salah. Al 67', l'attaccante olandese calcia forte in area trasformando un rigore in movimento, ma l'arbitro annulla il gol dopo aver rivisto l'episodio al Var e rilevato il fuorigioco di Nunez . Chiude allora i conti l'egiziano che dopo un gran controllo indovina un diagonale chirurgico che vale il definitivo 3-1.\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",
