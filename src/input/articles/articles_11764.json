    "title": "Paula Badosa Reflects On 'Insane Improvement' After Losing Australian Open Semi-Final",
    "text": "Paula Badosa has reflected on her ‘insane improvement’ over the last few months as she lost in the Australian Open semi-finals.\nAfter a good start to the match, Paula Badosa was ultimately outplayed by Aryna Sabalenka as the defending champion secured a 6-4 6-2 win to move into a third consecutive Australian Open final.\nThe Spaniard broke to start the match and secured a 2-0 lead but ultimately Sabalenka was too strong on the day and the world number one advanced to the final.\nSpeaking after the match Badosa admitted there wasn’t much she could do about the performance and spoke about what it was like to break early against the world number one, “Well, I don’t think I have much to say. Also, the level of Aryna today, she played like a No. 1. I couldn’t do much more today,” Badosa started her press conference by saying.\n“I was playing good. I mean, the first set was really tight, a good level. Then in the second set she started to be very, very aggressive. Everything was working. Everything she was doing today, touching today, could become gold. I have nothing to say.\n“I mean, of course credits to her, congratulations to her. She played the best match not even of the week. From the last months, for sure. If she plays like this, I mean, we can already give her the trophy.\n“When you’re aggressive. When you go for the lines. When you change directions. When a ball is coming strong to you, but you’re able to change directions very easily. You’re fast. You’re serving well. You do everything well. That’s how a No. 1 plays. She did it today.”\nBadosa has now played Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek in big matches and the Spaniard has compared what it’s like to play both players with Badosa suggesting that playing Swiatek is physically harder, “Similar, that you have to bring your best out of when you play against them all the time. They’re, like, bringing you to the limits. You have to maybe take more risks against them. That’s what I found when I played against both of them,” Badosa explained.\n“But I think maybe the difference, what make them different, is that with Iga, when I played against her, I felt she destroyed me physically. She’s, like, so intense all the time, all the time very, very intense. It was like for me, of course, it’s a tennis match, but it was like a physical battle. I found, like, her legs are insane. She’s so fast.\n“With Aryna, it’s more like winners everywhere. Sometimes you’re like, I don’t know, I’m just walking around the court because I feel like she’s playing a PlayStation. Today she was like that. So sometimes I’m like, What’s happening? I don’t have time even to think. It’s completely different games, but at the same time you just have to bring the best out of you if you want to win them.”\nAn interesting perspective from Badosa as she now leaves Melbourne having reached her first Australian Open semi-final.\nIt is a massive positive from Badosa, considering she almost quit the sport in April and the Spaniard described her progress over the last six months as an ‘insane improvement,’ “Yeah, no, it’s really, really positive. I mean, I wasn’t expecting maybe improving or going so fast,” Badosa stated.\n“I didn’t check, but seeing the results of everyone, now I know I’m top 10, but I think the last months maybe it’s top 5 of the players that have win most matches. So for me that’s insane, and it’s an insane improvement, an insane improvement mentally, of believing, of coming back from that.\n“I mean, I was once top 10, but doing it two times I think not a lot of people are capable of that. I’m really proud of myself because it’s not easy when you’re 100 in the world and you have to face these kind of players, but in the first round. Coming back from that, I’m really, really proud of the journey.”\nBadosa will move up three places in the rankings to nine in the world when they get released on Monday.",

    "text": "Apple\nWhy iPhone 7 Users Should Upgrade in 2024\nIf you’re still holding onto an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, this is the year you should consider upgrading to a new iPhone model.\nSeven years is a long time in the tech world and that’s how long its been since Apple launched the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on stage at the Bill Graham Auditorium in San Francisco.\nAt this point, even if you still love your iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you’re probably feeling the pinch. Maybe it’s\nslow performance or dwindling battery life.\nMaybe the cameras leave something to be desired or maybe you’re tired of seeing friends and family use newer software features that aren’t available on your device.\nMaybe that’s you. Or maybe it isn’t. Even if you’re still determined to hold onto your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, there’s one big reason why you should probably think about upgrading in 2024.\niPhone 7 Users Should Upgrade in 2024\nBelieve it or not, when the iPhone 7 first shipped, it ran iOS 10 out of the box. It’s hard to even remember what iOS 10 looked like.\nSince then, Apple’s upgraded the devices with countless software updates. In the beginning, these updates delivered new features and enhancements. In recent years, the devices have been lucky to get a bug fix.\nYour iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is likely running iOS 15 and there’s a good chance that come this fall, your device will still be running iOS 15. This is problematic.\nWhile iOS 15 releases have been sporadic, Apple still supports the phones. The most recent update,\niOS 15.8.2, arrived in early March. Prior to that, iOS 15.8.1 rolled out with security patches in January.\nNo question, support for these devices is slowing down and there’s a\ngood chance it ends when Apple launches its new iOS 18 operating system in the fall.\nIf that happens, your phone won’t get any more bug fixes and, maybe more importantly, it won’t get upgraded with security patches to help protect you and your data from harm.\nThat’s a big deal and it might be the impetus to finally start looking at an upgrade. Yes, the prices of Apple’s flagship phones might be intimidating, but there are a wealth of cheap options out there.\nIf you don’t know where to embark on a search, check out our guide that covers the\nbest cheap iPhone models money can buy. All of them are better than the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they won’t break the bank.\n ",

    "text": "THURSDAY, Dec. 28, 2023 (HealthDay News) — A class of sedatives called benzodiazepines, which include meds like Ativan, Valium and Xanax, could be linked to higher odds for miscarriage if taken during pregnancy, new research finds.\nThe findings held even after accounting for possible confounding factors such as anxiety and insomnia, the Taiwanese research team said.\nLooking at data on about 3 million pregnancies, “we found that benzodiazepine use during pregnancy was associated with an approximately 70% increased risk of miscarriage,” wrote a team led by\nFei-Yuan Hsiao at Taiwan University’s Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy.\nBased on the findings, they urge that doctors “meticulously balance” the risks and benefits of benzodiazepines whenever they consider prescribing the drugs to pregnant women who are dealing with insomnia or other psychiatric issues.\nIn the new study, miscarriage was defined as loss of pregnancy between the first prenatal visit with a doctor (typically around the 8th week of gestation) and before the 20th week.\nHsiao’s group looked at data from over 3 million pregnancies among Taiwanese women, out of which 4.4% resulted in a miscarriage.\nFocusing on the women’s prescription drug use during pregnancy, the study found that using a benzodiazepine boosted the odds for miscarriage by 69%.\nThat number was “consistent” regardless of confounding factors and the duration of benzodiazepine use.\nThe study was published Dec. 27 in the journal\nJAMA Psychiatry.\nHsiao’s group also pointed to the results of a prior British study. It found that miscarriage rates were 60% higher among women who took a benzodiazepine while pregnant, compared to women who had psychiatric issues that might warrant use of the drugs (for example depression or anxiety) but who were not prescribed one.\nAccording to the research team, benzodiazepines “can readily cross the placental barrier and accumulate substantially in embryo and fetal tissues.” In turn, that potentially “may cause fetal developmental abnormalities, ultimately leading to miscarriage,” they said.\nThe study was not designed to prove cause-and-effect and the absolute risk of miscarriage to any one woman remains low.\nNevertheless, Hsiao’s team believes that “prescribing benzodiazepines should only be considered following a comprehensive evaluation of the potential risks and benefits for both the mother and the child.”\nMore information\nFind out more about miscarriage at the\nMarch of Dimes.\nSDOURCE: JAMA Psychiatry, Dec. 27, 2023\nCopyright ",

Este gesto de compromiso y asistencia por parte de Zamora contrasta con la indiferencia señalada por la senadora en relación al Gobierno central.\nAdemás, Larraburu insistió en la necesidad de tratar con urgencia el proyecto de ley de Emergencia Ambiental, Económica y Habitacional, así como otras iniciativas legislativas orientadas a fortalecer la prevención y respuesta ante incendios forestales.\nLa situación en la Patagonia sigue siendo crítica, y el apoyo de las provincias y la solidaridad de la ciudadanía se convierten en un pilar fundamental frente a la falta de respuestas a nivel nacional.\nMirá el video:",
