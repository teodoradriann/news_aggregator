    "text": "[Meteo](/meteo/)\nRaffiche sopra i 100 chilometri orari sull'appennino: la nottata di vento nel Ravennate\nI venti hanno sferzato i rilievi e le colline della provincia di Ravenna nel corso della notte. Per il weekend è atteso un miglioramento delle condizioni meteo\nRaffiche che hanno superato perfino i 100 chilometri orari. Come previsto dall’allerta arancione della Protezione Civile, quella tra giovedì e venerdì è stata una nottata condizionata dal vento forte, in particolar modo sull’entroterra. La centralina posizionata a Monte Romano di Brisighella ha registrato una raffica di 107 chilometri orari, ma il vento mite da sud-ovest si è fatto sentire su tutta l’area pedemontana. A San Mamante di Faenza la stazione associata alla rete di Emilia Romagna Meteo ha registrato una punta massima di 85,3 chilometri orari. Dati in diminuzione, man mano che ci si allontano dai rilievi: a San Biagio di Faenza si sono i 61,2 chilometri orari, mentre a Oriolo dei Fichi sono stati registrati quasi 48 chilometri orari.\nLa tendenza per le prossime ore è per un miglioramento delle condizioni meteo. Sabato si annuncia stabile con un'alternanza di schiarite ed annuvolamenti e temperature in diminuzione sia nei valori minimi (tra -1 e 3 gradi) che massimi (tra 4 e 8), mentre la domenica si annuncia grigia, ma senza piogge. Nei giorni a seguire, informa il servizio meteorologico dell’Arpae, “l'instaurarsi un flusso occidentale debolmente perturbato porterà ad un aumento della nuvolosità su tutta la regione con deboli precipitazioni lungo i rilievi e sulla pianura. Le temperature saranno dapprima in aumento, poi in diminuzione nella giornata di martedì”.",

    "title": "mRNA Therapeutics and Global Markets - MRNA Therapeutics Market Sees Robust Growth as Global Demand for Revolutionary Medical Treatments Surges - ResearchAndMarkets.com | News | starkvilledailynews.com",
    "text": "The \"mRNA: Therapeutics and Global Markets\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nThe global market for mRNA therapeutics reached $60 billion in 2022 and is estimated to reach $21 billion by the end of 2028. It is expected to decline at the CAGR of -8.6% during the forecast period. The decline, which stems from the end of COVID-19 pandemic, should be mitigated by the introduction of new drugs during the forecast period.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a niche market for mRNA therapeutics, particularly vaccines. Developed countries used mRNA vaccines for protection against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2. The fast-paced development of mRNA vaccines was possible due to advancement in sequencing as well as two decades of previous research on mRNA drugs. mRNA drugs should become a major segment of vaccines and therapeutics.\nThe mechanism of action of mRNA vaccine is like that elucidated by the protein-based vaccines. The mRNA particle, which is inserted into a healthy patient, carries the code for an antigen (a small piece of protein found on the virus's outer membrane). Viral proteins are produced via the mRNA code. The body recognizes it as a foreign material and produces antibodies necessary for the protection against the diseases.\nKey factors driving the mRNA global market include the increasing number of pandemics and epidemic diseases. In the past 20 years, the world has experienced the two epidemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and the pandemic COVID-19. These situations highlighted the need for technologies like mRNA that are easy to produce and upscale quickly. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed mRNA therapeutics to the forefront of the pharma and bio-pharma industries.\nAnother key growth factor is the pharmaceutical industry's investment in the mRNA segment. Large pharmaceutical companies are seeking innovative drugs that have limited side effects. mRNA presents one such opportunity. Also, private investments are increasing in this segment, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, the market also is facing a few challenges, such as lack of standard regulations that affect a different class of therapeutics. This leads to confusion for new and existing players for which pathway to follow. Existing and new technologies, such as protein and CRISP, respectively, also pose competition.\nThe pipeline of mRNA drugs is robust. Under favorable conditions, a drug should enter the market by late 2024 or early 2025. Currently, the majority of drugs in the pipeline target infectious diseases or are being developed as vaccines. Also, therapeutic drugs target cancer treatment. Some drugs have received fast-track status from the FDA, increasing the pace of those clinical trials due to their promising results. Drug trials using mRNA vaccines are showing efficacy in the range of 70% to 85%. There are 2 influenzas vaccines which are, under phase 3 clinical trials and will be commercialized during the forecast period.\nReport Scope\nThis report focuses on the mRNA therapeutics market and includes the types of mRNA and their application in therapy. Also, the report focuses on the patent analysis and clinical trial analysis of mRNA. The report also portrays the trends and dynamics affecting the market during the study period. The study covers market projections through 2028 and profiles major market players.\nThe Report Includes\n37 data tables and 27 additional tables An overview of the global market related to mRNA therapeutics In-depth analysis of global market trends, featuring historical revenue data for 2021 and 2022, estimated figures for 2023, forecasts for 2028, and projections of compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) through 2028 Evaluation of the current market and revenue growth prospects specific to mRNA therapeutics, accompanied by a market share analysis by therapeutic type and geographical region Coverage of the pandemic threats, therapeutic developments, and new technologies in the market Discussion of the advantages of mRNA over protein and DNA-based delivery systems, demographic and economic trends, and outlook for the mRNA therapeutics market Information on prophylactic vaccines, vaccine discovery and development, and R&D activities Analysis of the various therapeutics as well as promising vaccines intended for the prevention and treatment of chronic and infectious diseases Assessment of regulatory structure, pricing and reimbursement scenarios, the pipeline for new molecules and therapeutics Market share analysis of the key companies and mergers & acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborations, and partnerships Profiles of leading market participants Key Topics Covered:\nChapter 1 Introduction\nChapter 2 Summary and Highlights\nChapter 3 Market Overview\nEvolution of RNA Therapeutics History of RNA Therapeutics Development of RNA Therapeutics and Types DNA Therapeutics vs. RNA Therapeutics Clinical Need for RNA Therapeutics Increasing Disease Population and Economic Burden Limitations of Traditional Therapeutics Therapeutic Limitations of Biologics Poor Management of Chronic Diseases Limited Treatment for Rare Diseases RNA Therapeutics Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) as Therapeutics Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) as Therapeutics miRNA as Therapeutics Aptamers as Therapeutics mRNA as Therapeutics Manufacturing RNA-Based Biopharmaceuticals Chromatographic Purification Steps Delivery of RNA Therapeutics Polymer Conjugation/Chemical Modification Encapsulation Lipid-Based Nanoparticles Polymer Nanomaterials Silica Nanoparticles Carbon and Gold Nanomaterials GalNAc Institution and Hospital-Based RNA Therapeutics Regulatory Influence on the Market for RNA Therapeutics Impact of COVID-19 Chapter 4 Market Dynamics\nChapter 5 Target Disease and Disorders\nChapter 6 Pipeline and Clinical Trial Analysis\nChapter 7 Market Breakdown by Product\nChapter 8 Market Breakdown by Region\nChapter 9 Emerging Technologies and Developments\nNanoparticles Modified mRNA Automated mRNA Synthesis Kits Bio Platforms Chapter 10 Patent Analysis\nChapter 11 Outlook for Mergers & Acquisitions, and Venture Funding\nChapter 12 Competitive Intelligence\nChapter 13 Company Profiles\nArctur U.S. Therapeutics Biontech Curevac Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Merck Moderna Nutcracker Therapeutics Omega Therapeutics Strand Therapeutics Vaxess Technologies For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/8ed6om\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

    "text": "How to fix Diablo 4 “queued for game, start game pending” messageBlizzard Entertainment\nDiablo 4 is not immune to server issues, resulting in players receiving annoying messages when attempting to log in, so here’s a quick rundown on the “queued for game, start game pending” message and whether you can fix it or not in Diablo 4 Season 3.\nBlizzard’s\nDiablo 4 is a live service game, which means it requires a constant internet connection to play. Despite its lengthy campaign, the game lacks an offline mode, which might be disappointing for many players.\nRegular server issues further frustrate players as they face login issues such as\nerror code 315306 and messages like “queued for game, start game pending” especially when they are grinding to complete the Vaults introduced in Season of the Construct. Diablo 4 has many great single-player features, but these errors prevent players from enjoying them.\nHere’s everything you need to know about the Diablo 4 “queued for game” error.\nCan you fix Diablo 4 “queued for game, start game pending” message?\nThe only way to fix the\nhttps://diablo4.blizzard.com/ “queued for game, start game pending” message is to wait for the queue to whittle down, as closing the application will reset the timer and your place in the queue will be lost.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to get around the issue or speed up the process, so while it may be frustrating, the best option is to wait for the queue to go down. The error occurs when the\nDiablo 4 servers are under stress, as millions of users try to access the game at once.\nTo counter this, players are placed into a queue to ease the pressure on the servers by letting players log in gradually. Diablo 4 devs seem to be aware of this problem, which is fairly common in online or live service games, and have put out various fixes that have reduced the number of server issues.\nWhy Diablo 4 queues are so long?\nBlizzard addressed the problems with long queues right after Diablo 4 was originally released, and stated that Diablo 4 has long queue times to stop servers from becoming “overcrowded.”\nDevs also stated Diablo 4 has been one of their most successful releases\ndespite fans’ complaints, that long queues are Blizzard’s way of controlling the flow of players into the game world so those who can get it, “can enjoy a seamless gaming experience.”\n“Long queue times may seem unfair, but they provide an equal opportunity for all players to access the game. Without queues, the servers could become overcrowded, leading to a subpar experience for everyone. The queue system ensures that everyone gets a chance to play without overwhelming the servers,” Blizzard stated\nin their forums.\nThat was all about the “queued for game, start game pending” message in Diablo 4.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#19](c19#c-19) En realidad sí, pero no te alarmes, no hay construcción de la identidad etnica de un grupo (y más si se trata de uno generalmente minoritario y perseguido)n sin su dosis de etnocentrismo.\nEn el caso de los creyentes en yahvé el resto de la humanidad es referida como “goyim”, o “gentiles” y no tiene connotaciones especialmente positivas.\n[#9](c9#c-9) [#19](c19#c-19) \"En la Torá se afirma claramente que el hombre fue creado con un propósito concreto: emular la justicia Divina sobre la Tierra. En un principio, toda la humanidad fue elegida para esta tarea. Sin embargo, los primeros hombres no dieron cumplimiento a esta, misión y permitieron que la- corrupción y la violencia predominaran sobre la justicia y la bondad. Por ese motivo, Dios determinó que se produjera el Gran Diluvio (Mabul) a fin de eliminar a los malvados. En lo sucesivo el castigo por incumplimiento se llevaría a cabo a nivel nacional y no universal. Por esa razón Dios eligió a una nación en particular para que cumpliera esta misión. El Pueblo Elegido seria una nación modelo de Dios sobre la Tierra y demostraría al resto de la humanidad cómo comportarse. Esta nación era la judía.\"\nhttps://www.tora.org.ar/pueblo-elegido-y-su-mision/\nSi eso no es considerar a un pueblo por encima del resto, da lugar a suficientes malas interpretaciones como para llamarles supemacistas.\nNo hay religión buena, no hay fanático respetable.\n[#51](c51#c-51) Qué curioso que un diós omni-de-todo ande con fallos de producción (los prototipos) y culpe de ello a sus creaciones.\nDiós: te voy a hacer libre... y te voy a colocar aquí el fruto del pecado. No lo toques, eh?\nEl Diablo, también creado por Diós, pero SIN que Diós se percate, dice: no seais pipas, esto mola.\nDiós: Malos! Me habeis desobedecido. Hala.... a la mierda. Pero es vuestra culpa, eh? Que quede claro. Y si os poneis cabezotas, mando a Abogados Cristianos a que se querellen.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron.

    "text": "gente de la tierra\nInvestigación y ciencia para cuidar del entorno rural desde un pueblecito de Aragón\nNatalia Langa ha ganado dos premios gracias a su tesis doctoral sobre sistemas alternativos para proteger el viñedo de enfermedades fúngicas.\nImpulsar el valor del trabajo agrícola y concienciar sobre la importancia de cuidar del entorno rural para que no caiga en el olvido. Es la filosofía de vida de la doctora en Ciencias Agrarias y del Medio Natural Natalia Langa, cuyo vínculo con el campo se remonta a su infancia. \"Mi familia, originaria de La Puebla de Albortón, siempre ha vivido de la agricultura, cultivando trigo duro y almendros en ecológico y, hace años, también viñedo\", afirma. Fue precisamente esa conexión la que le hizo estudiar Ingeniería Agrónoma y dedicarse, posteriormente, a la investigación. \"La agricultura y la ganadería no solo me apasionan, sino que representan un pilar esencial para la sociedad, del que todos dependemos a diario. Poder aportar un pequeño granito de arena a su mejora es una gran motivación\", añade.",

Si es 0, tiene 0 votos y no puedes ver nada.\nde una noticia, justo antes del primer comentario hay un desplegable y una de las opciones es \"votos\".\nHablo de la interfaz antigua, claro. Y ver los votos siempre ha sido de la más poco intuitivo que he visto, no sé que tiene que ver con la ordenación de los comentarios.\n#1 No se que tienes que tener en la cabeza para que el hecho probado de que los soldados Israelies van allí a matar civiles a placer te parezca sensacionalista o irrelevante.\nEn este mundo hay gente jodidamente mala y la mayoría lo son porque no se han parado a pensar dos veces.\n#17 No se que tienes que tener en la cabeza para que el hecho probado de que los terroristas de Hamás van allí a matar civiles a placer te parezca sensacionalista o irrelevante.\nEn este mundo hay gente jodidamente mala y la mayoría lo son porque no se han parado a pensar dos veces.\n#26 ¿Y quien ha dicho que sea irrelevante que Hamas mate?\nLo que también es un hecho probado es que Israel lleva décadas haciéndolo y ahora, simplemente, se sienten excusados para matar aún más, más rápido y más cruel.\n¿Crees que ese niño era un terrorista de Hamas? ¿Crees que hacía falta matar a ese niño para defenderse de Hamas?\n¿De verdad crees que la existencia de Hamas ha causado esto? ¿No te das cuenta de que la presencia de Hamas ahí es una respuesta a 70 años de colonización? Si no vas a responder a todas las preguntas, por mi no te molestes en responder.\nArgumento de mierda el tuyo.\n#1 como fabricar un suicida jihadista en 5 simples tiros.\nLuego se sorprenden de que les pase lo que les pasa.\n#25 y no les pasa prácticamente nada, pero lloran mucho y muy alto. Si de verdad les pasara algo, se lo pensarían dos veces antes de cometer estos miles de crímenes de guerra.\n#4 Yo ya me estoy replanteando la actitud de Alemania con los juicios y eso... a esta altura me parece todo una pantomima para congraciarse con algunos gobiernos y poder hacer negocios, en lugar de ser aislados...\nPorque después de haber cometido genocidio, van y apoyan y defienden a otro país genocida, es claro que los genocidios para ellos son simplemente herramientas y nada más...\n#4 De soga al cuello nada, condenado de por vida a limpiar letrinas en un orfanato de niños palestinos.\nSon unos salvajes, no sólo el \"francotirador\" sino todo aquel que lo exculpa, lo protege, y lo defiende.\nSe le ven demasiado las costuras a nuestro \"lado bueno de la historia\" y sus defensores, y quienes nos gobiernan dura o blandamente.\nme parece que no tenemos suficiente conciencia del adoctrinamiento al que se somete a los israelíes desde niños,por ejemplo, las canciones que cantan los niños en sus excursiones en autobús... Aquí un ejemplo :\n#13 Israel será objeto de estudio en un futuro, de a donde puede llegar el adoctrinamiento de una población entera cuando dejas que inoculen propaganda militarismo desde niños.\n#35 sus fronteras están rodeadas de gente que los quieren exterminar (de hecho ya lo han intentando). En cierta medida entiendo el adoctrinamiento que tienen. Obviamente eso no justifica el crimen de guerra de esta noticia.\nLas bondades de las democracias plenas, el mundo libre, los inclusivos y de grandes principios morales.\nLa culpa de los nazis es que perdieron la guerra, y estos la están ganando, con el necesario apoyo de los USA y de la Unión Europea.",

All are residents of Lucknow.\n“The suspects lured economically weaker individuals into opening bank accounts under the pretext of earning easy money. The credentials of these accounts, cheque books, debit cards, and internet banking details were then shared with their handlers in China,” said Dixit.\nCyber Crime Police station SHO Brijesh Yadav said, “The funds, collected under the guise of online trading, digital arrests, task cards, and work-from-home schemes, were transferred into these accounts. The accused withdrew the money before the accounts could be flagged or frozen. A portion of the fraudulently obtained money was kept as commission while the rest was converted into cryptocurrency (USDT) and sent to Chinese digital wallets.”\nAn FIR has been registered under sections 317(2), 318(4), 61(2)(B) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and Section 66C of the IT Act at the Cyber Crime Police Station, Lucknow. The seized bank account data has been uploaded on the Cyber Crime Reporting Portal for further cross-verification and action.",

    "text": "Former President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed a barrage of attacks against International Criminal Court, which is investigating the ex chief executive over allegations of crimes against humanity over his bloody war on drugs. Duterte made the profanity laden remarks on Monday during a podcast hosted by former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque and Trixie Cruz Angeles, who served under the administration of Duterte incumbent and President Bonbon Marcos respectively. That occurs the International Criminal Court as he questioned their jurisdiction in the country. Following the accusation against him, Duterte declared the Philippines withdrawal from the Rome Statute or the treaty which established the International Criminal Court, in March 2018. The withdrawal took effect on March 2019. Despite this, the International Criminal Court retained jurisdiction over alleged crimes in the Philippines from November 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019, while the country was still a state party. The former president also slammed the International Criminal Courts over what he thinks is its double standards when it comes to Western countries. Duterte was the chief architect of the bloody drug war waged during his roles as the countries chief executive and as mayor of Davao City. The drug war under his presidency claimed at least 6000 lives during his term as president, according to official government data. But human rights watchdogs and International Criminal Court itself estimated the death toll under the Tartus drug. To be between 12,000 and 30,000 from 2016 to 2019 alone as they noted that several of these are extrajudicial killings.",
