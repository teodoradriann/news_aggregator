    "text": "A hostel turned largely into a homeless shelter in Miami Beach could soon be demolished – and neighbors could not be happier.\nThe development comes as a developer cut a deal with the owner of the Bikini Hostel to buy the property.\nWatch NBC6 free wherever you are\n WATCH HERE\nThat move prompted the Miami Beach city commission last week to unanimously approve the developer’s request to move forward with plans to build a taller condo than current zoning allows across West Avenue from the hostel.\nLong before it became home to more than 100 homeless people displaced from a shelter in Miami, neighbors along West Avenue and 13th Street say Bikini Hostel’s sometimes noisy, party atmosphere had been a nuisance.\nGet local news you need to know to start your day with NBC 6's News Headlines newsletter.\nSIGN UP\nThe deal between the owners of the hostel and the JDS Development Group, looking to expand its real estate empire across the street, could make almost everyone happy.\nWhen it came to the homeless people winding up there, JDS’ CEO Michael Stern wanted city commissioners to know this:\n“I want to make it clear that we had utterly nothing to do with it,” he said at last week’s meeting. “We were burdened with this problem by bad actors, and if this deal gets approved, it will end up costing us tens of millions of dollars.”\nThat’s how much he could wind up paying to buy the hostel property, a deal one commissioner said would allow Stern to charge more for each of the 100 to 125 units planned for the 330-foot-tall condo he wants to build across the street.\n“I really doubt that Mr. Stern, that JDS, that the development team would be able to sell these units for what they're going to be asking for if they had to say that they had a homeless shelter in front of these multi-million-dollar luxury units,” said Commissioner Alex Fernandez.\nThe discussion produced much talk of win-wins.\n“To me, what's being presented here, with the elimination of the Bikini Hostel, is actually a public benefit,” said fellow commissioner David Suarez.\nThe commission’s unanimous support of Stern’s request is the first step on a road to oblivion for the Bikini Hostel -- a longtime goal of its neighbors.\n“Most importantly, Mr. Stern is buying the Bikini Hostel,” one director of a nearby condominium told commissioners. “When I heard that he was going to do this, I started to cry. The Bikini Hostel has been a scourge and a blight on the West Avenue neighborhood for 15 years now.”\nAdded another neighbor: “It's dangerous for the residents, it's dangerous for children, it creates an unsafe environment, and it's been growing worse and worse over time. The demolition of the Bikini Hostel is imperative.”\nHow dangerous the homeless made it is not clear from police calls in the area since they were shipped to the hostel in November.\nNBC6 Investigates found the number of police calls for crimes and serious quality of life issues in the area actually fell slightly, by about 3%, in the months afterwards, compared to the same months a year earlier. One reason could be the round-the-clock presence of a Miami Beach Police unit outside the building, costing the city more than $1,000 a day.\nThe hostel was not violating laws or zoning ordinances in housing up to 117 people in its fewer than 20 small rooms stacked with bunk beds, but there’s no doubt their presence unnerved neighbors.\n“It has created a perception of safety concerns in West Avenue,” said Commissioner Fernandez. “It's drawn just endless complaints from the neighbors. And frankly, the city doesn't have the $20 million it would take to buy and repurpose the property.”\nBut developer Stern does.\n“We would be thrilled if the city could solve this issue on its own,” he said, “but we are unaware of any mechanism to make that happen.”\nSo he made his deal to buy the hostel, demolish it as soon as September and give the land to the city two months after his company receives permission to start occupying the condo building he hopes to complete in 2030.\nAs for the homeless, the hostel owners have agreed to use at least $1 million from the sale to purchase a property in Miami where they and others in need can be relocated.\nAn attorney for the hostel owners told NBC6 the deal “represents a constructive and humane solution, demonstrating how the private sector and local government can work together to solve intractable social problems while preserving constitutional rights.”\nStern and his lawyers did not return calls or emails seeking comment.\nThe commission still must approve the development agreement and finalize the zoning changes.\nBut as last week’s vote was unanimous, it looks like the days of the Bikini Hostel and the complaints it generates are numbered.",

But that drive could be on a collision course with the Trump administration’s threat to revoke federal funding from DEI schools. Just before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President Donald Trump, Notre Dame Provost John McGreevy sent a faculty-wide email stating that the hiring priorities of the school were to increase “the number of women and underrepresented minorities” and that those DEI goals were “equally important” to hiring Catholic faculty.",

    "text": "9\nNel 1962, la NASA lanciò la sonda Mariner 1 con l’ambizioso obiettivo di raggiungere Venere e compiere la prima esplorazione planetaria americana.\nTuttavia, l’emozione di questo lancio fu di breve durata: a causa di un piccolo errore nel codice, il Mariner 1 finì fuori rotta di oltre 100.000 miglia, obbligando gli ingegneri a distruggere il razzo per evitare un possibile impatto con l’oceano Atlantico. Il problema? Un trattino mancante nel software di guida.\nLa missione Mariner 1 faceva parte del [programma della NASA per la conquista dello spazio](https://tech.everyeye.it/articoli/speciale-mariner-pioneer-origini-esplorazione-spaziale-59281.html) durante la Guerra Fredda, un periodo in cui l’America e l’Unione Sovietica erano in competizione per raggiungere per prime nuovi traguardi ([la Russia ci riuscì ed ecco perché il pianeta è considerato russo](https://tech.everyeye.it/notizie/-venere-pianeta-russia-secondo-agenzia-spaziale-russa-469741.html)).\nLa sonda, costruita in tempi record dal Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), era programmata per raccogliere dati sul clima e le radiazioni magnetiche di Venere, ma poco dopo il decollo il razzo cominciò a deviare dalla traiettoria prevista.\nDopo giorni di analisi, si scoprì che la causa dell’errore era un trattino mancante nel codice scritto per il sistema di guida della sonda. Questo piccolo errore, che sembrava quasi insignificante, fece interpretare alla sonda dati errati, portandola fuori rotta e causando il fallimento dell’intera missione.\nL’incidente, oltre a costare all’America una missione interplanetaria e milioni di dollari, rappresentò una lezione fondamentale per la NASA, che da allora si impegnò a migliorare i controlli sui software per evitare che errori minimi potessero compromettere missioni spaziali cruciali.\n[Fire TV Stick 4K Max di Amazon è uno dei più venduti oggi su ](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0CW4HD359?tag=notizie_tech-21)\nQuesto testo include collegamenti di affiliazione: se effettui un acquisto o un ordine attraverso questi collegamenti, il nostro sito potrebbe ricevere una commissione in linea con la nostra [pagina etica](https://www.everyeye.it/advertising/).

Read time: 1 minute\nBuilding on research that has linked immune responses with certain neurobehavioral conditions, researchers at Duke Health have identified how a key infection-fighting function is involved in triggering hyperactive behaviors in mice.\nThe finding, appearing this month in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity , adds insight to an on-off switch for genes called STAT1. This gene regulator plays a pivotal role in the immune system’s response to infections and has also been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and ADHD.\n“A lot of these pathways that have been discovered in the immune system also play important roles in the brain,” said senior author Anthony Filiano , Ph.D., assistant professor in the departments of Neurosurgery and Pathology at Duke University School of Medicine and a faculty member in the Marcus Center for Cellular Cures. “There is a very robust communication between the two systems. This is intriguing because the immune system is very targetable from a therapy perspective.”\nFiliano and colleagues at Duke worked with a team at Columbia University that bred mice with a STAT1 mutation. Using these mice, they were able to over-activate the immune pathway in different cell types of the brain, including dopamine neurons, which help modulate reward, motivation, and motor control.\nWant more breaking news?

    "title": "Victorian Literature: The Corruption of Christianity in Dracula Free Essay Example",
    "text": "24/7 writing help on your phone Save to my list Remove from my list In the 19th century, Christianity suffered a decline of faith. Scientific discoveries and the publication of rational studies of the Bible as a historical book and not as God’s word, like The life of Jesus (1808-74) from David Strauss, contributed to the decrease of the Christian belief. Moreover, the publication of theories like On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural selection (1859) from Charles Darwin enforced the idea that God was not the Creator. On the other side, the literature of that period reflected a strong fear of foreign invasion by the Victorian society. In this way, Dracula is a novel, which background’s, reflects the fear of the 19th century reader of losing the style of life they knew and the way to establish it as it was before. In the novel, this fear is presented as a foreign monster that perverts the most susceptible being, the women. Many scholars understood the novel as an allegory of non-supernatural issues that occurred at the end of the 19th century. In order to fight Dracula, Christian symbols are used, like crucifixes and communion wafers. The use of this symbols can be seen as hypocrite -due to Victorian society’s decision to trust in science-. However if we realize that count Dracula is seen as the personification of the Devil, the use of religious symbols and religious rituals must not be strange, symbols of the good forces are used to combat a very dangerous one. According to Steven Herbert, the crucifix “symbolizes the surrender of ego to Spirit so necessary to achieve Wholeness. This powerful archetype embodies the message that the lower nature of man must die first before the Higher nature can be resurrected” that means, in Landix words, “that the Flesh and the Spirit are conflicting and the crucifix represents the Spirit triumphing over the flesh to achieve eternal salvation”. So that the crucifix represents the restoration of their customs and principles. On the other side, an other important point is what the character of Count Dracula really represents. As it is said before, Dracula, in the background, represents a foreign threat that tries to pervert the English society principles. Through the appearance of a demonic creature, with red eyes and fangs, which represents the devil personification. In other words, it represents the fear of the change, either by an external physical threat or the threat of the arrival of new modern ideas that represented the disrupt of their society values and norms. The most susceptible being were women, that were not strong enough to avoid Dracula’s enchantment to avoid being infected, as they are more probable to get pervert with the new modern foreign ideas. Mina’s character represents the perfect Victorian women that follows the patriarchal and religious model, whereas Lucy that do not as soon as she became infected like the three vampire women. They represent independence, erotism and non-maternal feelings and behaviour that are not well seen in the Victorian times. Mina represents the patriarchal middle class model, she is sweet and domesticated. She does not let the vampire pervert her and fight against it. Unfortunately, when Lucy becomes infected the only way to be saved was through death. As she became a night creature, only the use of Christian symbols and rituals employed by the perfect Anglican men could save her soul from the eternity. In the novel, despite the use of Christian symbols, the constant use of pagan symbols are justified and necessary in order to get rid of the threat that vampirism implies. However, despite the combination of these factors it is important to follow the Christian and patriarchal perfect model, mostly the women. An example of this situation can be seen in chapter XXVII, when Mina is tempted to choose vampirism by the three women that tries to seduce her with her provocative and hypnotize voice, but she prefers to follow the patriarchal role model: “They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina, and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water. Glasses: “Come sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turner to my poor ooh Madam Mina and my heart with gladness leapt like flame, for oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, one of them.” In the last part of the novel, in Jonathan’s notes, Christianity is more present than ever: “We want no proofs, we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her sweetness and loving care, later on he will understand how some men so loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.”In this passage, Van Helsing is elevating Mina as the category of a Saint that could maintain herself pure to take into account the most important labour in a woman’s life give birth to a child that will continue with the Patriarchal an Cristian principles. In conclusion, Christianity in the novel is used, jointly with occultism factors, to fight the dangerous foreign threat that Count Dracula represent. Along the novel, Christian values are always present and the way to be saved and do not become pervert is to follow them and do not move away. However, we should not forget that the threat that Count Dracula supposes is hidden by a fear of being invaded with new ideas that represent the perfect patriarchal Anglican model. 👋 Hi!

    "text": "Gateway Church joins local response to deadly Texas flood\nGateway Church in Southlake, Texas, joined multiple churches and relief agencies Wednesday in responding to the devastating flooding in the Texas Hill Country that has killed at least 120 people, while another 172 remain missing since last Friday.\nIn a statement provided to The Christian Post, Gateway Church leaders said they launched crisis relief efforts as soon as they became aware of the tragedy. They called on their community to give and pray. The response was overwhelming, they said.\n\"Gateway family and community — in response to the devastating floods that swept through Central Texas on the Fourth of July, you've taken action and your generosity has been incredible,\" the church noted in a statement on Facebook Wednesday, along with a video message from executive pastor, Nic Lesmeister.\n\"Thank you for responding with compassion and quick action by giving generously to support those affected by the flooding. We ask that you join us in continuing to pray for every victim, their families, and the first responders serving tirelessly in the aftermath.\"\nLesmeister said Gateway Church will be directing flood relief donations to \"trusted ministries that have been approved by the state of Texas\" to work in the affected areas.\nThe church further told CP that funding had been distributed directly to Mercy Chefs, a faith-based nonprofit disaster relief organization that provides professionally prepared, restaurant-quality meals to victims, volunteers, and first responders in the wake of natural disasters.\nCamp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls located along the Guadalupe River, which has been in operation since 1926, remains among the areas hardest hit by the flood.\nAt least 27 attendees and counselors from the camp are either dead or missing. Another five campers and a counselor are still unaccounted for, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said.\nScott and Katie Fineske, who own and direct the all-boys Camp La Junta in Hunt, Texas, thanked God that no one from their camp died during the flood but grieve for the victims at Camp Mystic.\n\"We are profoundly grateful that every boy at Camp La Junta is safe, yet our hearts are heavy,\" they said in a statement, cited by ABC News. \"We grieve with the families of the Camp Mystic girls and with everyone affected by this tragedy, including our dear friends, Dick Eastland and Jane Ragsdale.\"\nRagsdale, the director of the Heart O' the Hills Camp for Girls, and Eastland, the longtime director of Camp Mystic, both died in the flooding.\nThe Fineskes said that when the floodwaters crossed their camp's main field on Friday morning, \"our team moved cabin-by-cabin to higher ground and confirmed, through repeated headcounts, that every camper and staff member was accounted for.\"\nThey learned later that day of the Camp Mystic deaths, which shook their entire community.\nWhile state officials investigate what went wrong, many other churches, such as Park Cities Baptist Church in Dallas, have also stepped forward to help flood victims.\n\"In response to the recent devastating flooding in Kerr County and across the Hill Country, the PCBC Missions Committee has designated $10,000 to Texans on Mission to support their ongoing relief efforts for those impacted by this tragedy,\" the church announced Wednesday. \"If you feel led to be the hands and feet of Jesus in this time of need, opportunities to serve are available at texansonmission.org/serve.\"\nMembers of Gateway Church and leaders in Southlake have also joined together to provide prayer and support for families impacted by the floods in Kerr County. Gateway Church is also helping cover critical crisis needs, including rebuilding efforts, funeral expenses, and emergency aid for displaced families.\nContact: leonardo.blair@christianpost.com Follow Leonardo Blair on Twitter: @leoblair Follow Leonardo Blair on Facebook: LeoBlairChristianPost",
