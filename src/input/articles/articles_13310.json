This was [reported ](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/den-prisvyachenij-situaciyi-na-hmelnichchini-bezpeka-zahist-90681)by the President's Office. \"Today I am in Khmelnytskyy. The day is devoted to the situation in the region - security issues, defence of the region, everything related to the contribution of the Khmelnytskyy Region to the defence of our entire state. There were detailed reports on air defence and electronic warfare in the region - at key facilities. We discussed the safety of the Khmelnytskyy nuclear power plant, the overall energy potential in the region and the restoration of those facilities that were damaged by Russian strikes,\" Zelenskyy said. He also said that he had [appointed ](https://en.lb.ua/news/2024/05/03/28874_zelenskyy_appoints_serhiy_tyurin.html)the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Tyurin, today. The president's team also presented the Made in Ukraine economic platform in the region. In addition, the head of state met with border guards, including cadets of the Academy of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.The Head of State also visited the military hospital and [presented](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/prezident-u-hmelnickomu-vidvidav-voyiniv-yaki-likuyutsya-pis-90673)awards. The doctors said that since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, this institution has provided assistance to about eight thousand Ukrainian defenders. In particular, they have introduced comprehensive wound treatment using devices that halve the treatment time, low-trauma shrapnel removal, and methods that accelerate wound healing and preserve limb function. Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the wounded servicemen and inquired about their health and treatment conditions. The President presented Orders \"For Courage\" of the third class and medals \"For Military Service to Ukraine\" to servicemen of the Armed Forces and the State Border Guard Service who were wounded in the east, in particular during the defence of Avdiyivka, Maryinka and Chasiv Yar in the Bakhmut sector. \"Thank you for everything you do for our country. It's a pleasure to be here and award you. Thank you for defending Ukraine. Get well and come back home. I wish all of you and all of us victory,\" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also awarded medals \"For Saved Lives\" to military medics. \"First of all, I wish you all, your families and friends good health. You are bringing our soldiers back to life. I want to thank you for your daily hard work. We highly appreciate it,\" he said.",

    "text": "Venice residents consider themselves fortunate after Hurricane Milton leaves a mark Mary Lett Pensacola News Journal Grateful. Lucky. Blessed. These are words some Venice residents used to describe themselves and their city after Hurricane Milton made landfall a few miles north of them.\nOther than losing electrical power, cell service, water and some vegetation, several residents say their homes didn’t sustain any severe damage from the hurricane on Wednesday night.\n“We had a little bit of damage. We had tree limbs down, plants and other debris and such but there are a lot of people worse off than we are,” said Christine Straus as she handed out coffee to her neighbors Thursday morning.\n“Anything is hard to find right now so I’m hoping the coffee helps. We were very blessed.”\nThe Ohio native said she moved to Venice about seven years ago and has gone through four or five hurricanes but still loves the area.\nTom and Carol Norville who live on Venice Avenue say they are grateful.\n“We’ve been through a few hurricanes. This is probably the fourth one that was kind of memorable. But this one (Hurricane Milton) has come the closest, so far, to us,” Tom Norville said.\nThe couple evacuated to Palmer Ranch – about three miles inland – on Wednesday night.\n“We came out here this morning and to our surprise, the surge didn’t make it all the way up here. Our elevation is about 11 feet, and it looks like the surge here was probably about 7 or 8 feet – that was about it,’” he said of their home about a half-mile from Venice Beach.\nThe couple said their yard had the most damage.\n“No water in our house, just yard work,” Carol Norville said. “We’ve breathed a big sigh of relief now that Milton has passed.\"\nIn the historic downtown, a live oak tree in Heritage Park didn’t survive this hurricane – falling across and blocking Venice Avenue. Coastal Mowing and Tree was cutting up and removing the tree and other debris Thursday afternoon.\n“In Florida, we don’t have true growth seasons because we don’t ever get cold (winter), so you can’t count the rings to know the exact age of the tree. However, due to its size in this area, it’s a good bet that this tree is probably 80 to 100 years old,” Austin, the tree cutter said, noting the tree could be even older and has survived other major hurricanes – but not Milton.\n“It made it through Ian. It made it through Irma and Charley . It made it through Helene. Milton was the last straw for her, and she finally came down.”\nSeveral boats at Freedom Boat Club in Venice Harbor also didn’t weather the hurricane well. High winds tossed the pontoon boats about and stacked several on top of each other. One boat ended up on land.\nVenice Beach was a favorite destination for many residents who came out to check on the shore.\n“Other than the lifeguard stand, it’s still beautiful out here,” said Kellie Van Hilton, who rode out the storm with her husband and dogs at their North Venice Beach home.\n“We have no power, no cellphone service but our house is fine, and we live here, so we know that we’re lucky.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "Believing in God-given rights indicates 'Christian nationalism,' Politico journalist says Heidi Przybyla claims 'natural law' being misapplied to abortion, gay marriage An award-winning investigative journalist for Politico claimed during an MSNBC panel on Thursday that believing rights come from God is a marker of \"Christian nationalism.\" [Heidi Przybyla](https://www.heidiprzybyla.com/) also claimed on \"All In with Chris Hayes\" that former President Donald Trump is surrounding himself with an \"extremist element of conservative Christians\" who are misusing \"so-called natural law\" in their attempt to roll back abortion and LBGT rights. So I wanted to pull the more extended clip of this because surely the reporter clarified. But actually, it gets worse. She confuses mainline and mainstream evangelicalism (the former are liberal denominations). And says these Christians want to apply natural law to marriage,…— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) [https://t.co/GTrUIHTKYT] [pic.twitter.com/Svl5kewNqi] [February 23, 2024] \"Remember when Trump ran in 2016, a lot of the mainline Evangelicals wanted nothing to do with the divorced real estate mogul who had cheated on his wife with a porn star and all of that, right? So what happened was he was surrounded by this more extremist element,\" Przybyla said. \"You're going hear words like 'Christian nationalism,' like the 'New Apostolic Reformation,'\" she continued. \"These are groups that you should get very, very schooled on because they have a lot of power in Trump's circle.\" Przybyla went on to make a distinction between Christians and \"Christian nationalists,\" which she said are \"very different.\" What unites all Christian nationalists, she said, \"is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don't come from any earthly authority.\" \"They don't come from Congress, they don't come from the Supreme Court, they come from God,\" she added. \"The problem with that is that they are determining — man, men, and it is men — are determining what God is telling them.\" Calling it \"a pillar of Catholicism,\" Przybyla noted that natural law \"has been used for good and social justice campaigns,\" including in Martin Luther King Jr.'s fight for civil rights, but suggested \"an extremist element of conservative Christians\" are now misinterpreting natural law by applying it to abortion and gay marriage. \"And it's going much further than that, as you see, for instance, with a ruling in Alabama this week that judges connected to that Dominionist faction did,\" she said, referring to the recent decision from the Alabama Supreme Court that [ruled](/news/ivf-embryos-are-legally-protected-children-alabama-court-rules.html) frozen embryos created through in vitro fertilization are human beings protected by state law. Przybyla's comments echoed some of the assertions in her recent [article for Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/20/donald-trump-allies-christian-nationalism-00142086) titled \"Trump allies prepare to infuse ‘Christian nationalism’ in second administration,\" which argued that Christian nationalism is likely to play a major role in public policy if Trump takes back the White House. The article, which was also written by Alexander Ward, defined natural law as \"the belief that there are universal rules derived from God that can’t be superseded by government or judges,\" and likewise called it \"a pillar of Catholicism\" that has \"been used to oppose abortion, LGBTQ+ rights and contraception\" in recent decades. The main target of the article was Russell Vought, Trump's former director of the Office of Management and Budget, who was among [many on X who excoriated](https://twitter.com/WadeMiller_USMC/status/1761015125673222572/quotes) Przybyla on Friday for comments they claimed showed ignorance of basic American political thought as found in the second sentence of the Declaration of Independence. \"Mike Johnson should put a resolution on the floor reaffirming that we are one nation, under God. Make the Dems vote against it or be called Christian Nationalists,\" Vought [tweeted](https://twitter.com/russvought/status/1761027284712997013). The Politico article also hit at former Trump administration official William Wolfe, labeling him a Christian nationalist because he \"advocated for overturning same-sex marriage, ending abortion and reducing access to contraceptives.\" \"In a December post, [Wolfe] called for ending sex education in schools, surrogacy and no-fault divorce throughout the country, as well as forcing men 'to provide for their children as soon as it’s determined the child is theirs' — a clear incursion by the government into Americans’ private lives,\" the article said. Wolfe also contributed to the firestorm on X in response to Przybyla. \"Apparently believing in the ideas set forth in our Founding documents now makes you a — you guessed it — 'Christian Nationalist,'\" he [wrote](https://twitter.com/William_E_Wolfe/status/1761071648193581250), adding, \"Yes, Heidi, our rights do come from God. Again, the ignorance of these regime journalists is astounding. They know nothing about the American founding or Christian political thought.\" Others took aim, such as Republican Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison, who [wrote](https://twitter.com/brianeharrison/status/1761060773659279570), \"The very foundations of the America our founders built is under assault. Any elected Republican not doing everything they can to fight back is complicit.\" \"Politico has twice now, in print and with its reporter on MSNBC, raised flags about an idea central to the founding of the American Republic,\" journalist Erick Erickson [tweeted](https://twitter.com/EWErickson/status/1761059335772197216). \"This is troubling because it suggests a lack of education and understanding by its reporters.\" \"Believing rights come from God is now Christian Nationalism,\" [wrote](https://twitter.com/andrewtwalk/status/1761036021817315496) Andrew T. Walker, an ethics and public theology professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. \"This is a civics failure, a talent failure, an intelligence failure, a historical failure, an ethics failure ... shall I keep going? Elites we will always have. But my heavens, we need better elites.\" Przybyla responded Friday to some of the flak she was taking on X, [claiming](https://twitter.com/HeidiReports/status/1761048690804826589) her words were being misunderstood. \"While there are different wings of Christian Nationalism, they are bound by their belief that our rights come from God,\" she [wrote](https://twitter.com/HeidiReports/status/1761064510561861962). \"If you are Hindu, Jewish etc, this might help you understand the next part of my point, which is they are using this for a man-made policy agenda, which distinguishes this from other Christians who leave these God-given rights at our inherent right to 'Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' — vs banning abortion, contraception etc.\" Jon Brown is a reporter for The Christian Post.

    "title": "Trump says he'll fire Jack Smith 'within 2 seconds' if he's elected",
    "text": "Trump says he'll fire Jack Smith 'within 2 seconds' if he's elected The Harris campaign condemned Trump's comments as \"dangerous.\" Former President Donald Trump laid out Thursday what could be his first order of business if re-elected: firing the special counsel who indicted him in two federal cases. And his comments against Jack Smith were met with immediate pushback from Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, echoing their claims that the former president is acting as if he's above the law. However, the logistics of Smith's future and his investigations in a potential Trump second term are not as clear cut. Trump called into the \"Hugh Hewitt Show\" on Thursday and was asked if he would fire Smith if re-elected. \"We got immunity at the Supreme Court. It's so easy. I would fire him within two seconds. He'll be one of the first things addressed,\" Trump said. Trump added that he was going to sue Smith. Almost immediately after the show was broadcast, Harris' campaign condemned Trump's comments. Campaign spokeswoman Ammar Moussa said in a statement that Trump's comments were in line with the [warnings](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-kelly-swinging-trump/story?id=115061457) by former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly, who warned that Trump was acting like a fascist. \"A second Trump term, where a more unstable and unhinged Trump has essentially no guardrails and is surrounded by loyalists who will enable his worst instincts, is guaranteed to be more dangerous. America can't risk a second Trump term,\" Moussa said. While Trump would have the authority to direct his attorney general to fire the special counsel if reelected, it's not clear if he would have to issue any order to have the Justice Department dismiss its prosecutions against him. Any ongoing federal cases against Trump would likely halt once he assumes office, according to longstanding department policy. That policy and internal Office of Legal Counsel opinions state that a sitting president cannot face indictment or be criminally prosecuted as it \"would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\" Trump's attack on Smith was the latest against the special counsel and the Justice Department in their nearly [two-year-long investigation](https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-special-counsels-probe-trumps-efforts-overturn-2020/story?id=101537003) into his alleged criminal activity. Smith was appointed to his position by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to investigate Trump and his allies' efforts to overturn the 2020 election as well as Trump's alleged unlawful possession of highly classified documents he took from his time in the White House. He previously served as the chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague charged with investigating war crimes in Kosovo. Smith subpoenaed several of Trump's allies and family members to testify before a grand jury, including Ivanka Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence. On June 8, 2023, Smith indicted Trump on charges he unlawfully retained classified documents and obstructed the government's efforts to retrieve them. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal court in Florida. On Aug. 1, 2023, Trump was indicted on four felony counts related to his efforts to overthrow the 2020 election. Trump pleaded not guilty in federal court in Washington, D.C. Both cases were mired in delays as Trump appealed various aspects of the prosecutions, including an immunity challenge brought by Trump in his federal election subversion case that made it all the way to the Supreme Court. In July, the court's conservative majority ruled that Trump was entitled to some immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and sent the case back to the trial court to sort out which acts fell clearly outside the scope of his official duties as president. Two weeks after the Supreme Court decision, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump nominee, dismissed the classified documents case, ruling Smith's appointment as Special Counsel was unconstitutional because he was not appointed by the president or confirmed by Congress. Smith is appealing that decision and separately filed a superseding indictment against Trump in his D.C. federal case, presenting detailed arguments in a filing earlier this month about why Trump's actions advanced his personal interests and were not within his official duties. Trump also awaits sentencing for his May conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York and a possible criminal trial in Fulton County, Georgia, over his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election.

    "text": "Le doublage à la française, véritable exception culturelle, se trouve aujourd'hui menacé par l'essor de l’intelligence artificielle (IA). Les professionnels du secteur tirent la sonnette d’alarme face à une technologie qui, bien que fascinante, pourrait mettre leur métier en péril.\nL'essentiel du jour : notre sélection exclusive Chaque jour, notre rédaction vous réserve le meilleur de l'info régionale.

Vous pouvez vous désinscrire à tout moment via le lien en bas de cette newsletter. Notre politique de confidentialité Le doublage, c'est l'art de poser sa voix sur des images animées. Il est utilisé soit pour traduire des dialogues en version étrangère, soit pour donner vie à des personnages non réels avec la difficulté de maintenir une cohérence vocale malgré l’évolution des scénarios.\nQuand l'IA menace la VF Dans les rues d’Angers, un couple de doubleurs partage une inquiétude commune à de nombreux acteurs du doublage. Véronique Augereau et Philippe Peythieu prêtent leur voix à des personnages emblématiques : Marge et Homer Simpson, qui pourrait bientôt être reproduite par des algorithmes. Ces derniers, de plus en plus sophistiqués, sont capables de cloner une voix avec une précision bluffante, synchronisée au mouvement des lèvres en quelques secondes et à moindre coût.\nL'Intelligence Artificielle est non seulement capable de reproduire des voix, mais surtout de faire parler Marge Simpson ou Catherine Deneuve en italien, chinois ou encore portugais en quelques clics.\nVéronique Augereau et Philippe Peythieu, les voix de Marge et Homer Simpson • © France Télévisions Mais, pour les professionnels du secteur, il lui manque un petit supplément d'âme. Véronique Augereau, la doubleuse angevine, explique que cette technologie impressionnante reste dépourvue d’un élément essentiel : l’émotion humaine.\nL’intelligence artificielle a un QI énorme, mais nous avons un QE, un quotient émotionnel, qui fait toute la différence.\nVéronique Augereau Voix de Marge Simpson\nLa défense d’une exception culturelle française En France, le doublage n’est pas qu’un art, c’est aussi une industrie qui emploie plus de 15 000 personnes et fait vivre une vingtaine de métiers dans le domaine du cinéma ou encore des jeux vidéo.\nFace à la menace grandissante de l'IA, des comédiens de doublage ont créé le collectif Touche pas à ma VF. Ils appellent à une régulation rapide au niveau européen pour protéger cette richesse culturelle et militent pour préserver un savoir-faire unique, tout en sensibilisant le public.\nUn métier humain avant tout Le doublage est bien plus qu’une simple lecture de texte. Il nécessite une grande précision et une interprétation émotionnelle forte.\nAnthony Brutillot, créateur des Z'ateliers doublage, explique aux participants de ses stages que l'art du doublage nécessite de jouer la comédie, d'interpréter les images pour faire passer les émotions. \" On regarde le texte pour être synchronisé, mais évidemment on regarde aussi l'image, donc on dit monter à l'image dans le doublage, pour voir l'émotion de notre personnage. \"\nIci, petits et grands découvrent l’exigence du doublage et n'hésitent pas à prêter leur voix à des extraits. \" Ce n'est pas évident, mais de se mettre à la place, d'avoir cette émotion, de se dire bon ok, quelle voix je vais prendre, c'est hyper intéressant. Et ce serait vraiment dommage qu'on perde ce métier .\" explique une participante.\nLes enfants aux Z'ateliers doublage d'Anthony Brutillot • © France Télévisions Une bataille culturelle qui concerne tous les amoureux de la VF Et pour gagner cette bataille, les comédiens ont aussi besoin du public, car il ne s'agit pas que de la défense des emplois, c’est aussi une lutte pour préserver la VF. En France, le doublage est considéré comme étant de qualité, avec des artistes reconnus.\nLe public français est habitué à une qualité de doublage exceptionnelle, et c’est notre devoir de la maintenir.\nPhilippe Peythieu. Voix d'Homer Simpson\nLe doublage est un art mêlant interprétation et technique • © France Télévisions Besoin d'une législation claire Le but n'est pas d'empêcher le cours de l'évolution technologique, mais les signataires de la pétition demandent à ce que le gouvernement agisse et légifère pour la protection des artistes, des œuvres et de l'emploi.\nEn France, les voix humaines sont protégées par des droits d’auteur et des droits voisins. Cependant, les doublures vocales générées par IA peuvent contourner ces protections si elles n’utilisent pas directement un enregistrement préexistant, rendant la situation floue pour les artistes.\nBien que légalement possible, l'utilisation de l'IA dans le doublage nécessite un cadre juridique plus strict pour protéger les artistes et l'authenticité culturelle.\nRetrouvez-nous sur nos réseaux sociaux et sur france.tv",
