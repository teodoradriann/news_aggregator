De acordo com o fotógrafo norueguês Ramune Sapailaite, autor de algumas das fotografias do fenômeno, as nuvens ficaram visíveis durante o dia inteiro, mas as cores do arco-íris apareceram pouco antes do pôr do sol. Ele falou em entrevista ao site [spaceweather.com](https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2023/12/20/an-outbreak-of-polar-stratospheric-clouds-2/). Outros observadores compartilharam fotos com o site Live Science, de lugares como Noruega, Suécia, Finlândia, Alasca e do extremo sul da Escócia. O que é o evento O evento em questão acontece quando a temperatura cai na região estratosférica e forma pequenos cristais de gelo, que espalham a luz solar, se refletem e criam pequenos arco-íris no céu. Esses cristais ficam a uma altitude elevada, de cerca de 15 a 25 km da superfície, mas alto do que as nuvens se formam. No entanto, nas temperaturas baixas, o vapor d’água pode se unir e formar essas nuvens estratosféricas, também chamadas de nuvens nacaradas. O evento acontece poucas vezes no ano e normalmente em janeiro, o que o torna raro nessa época.",

    "text": "Zillow analyzed page views and days on market to find the most popular placesProspective homebuyers generally gravitated toward smaller cities in 2023The analysis showed a swing away from the Midwest toward the Northeast\nWest Chester, Pennsylvania, was the most popular place for people looking to buy a home in 2023, according to analysis from Zillow.\nThe real estate marketplace analyzed metrics that indicated consumer demand – including page-view traffic, home value growth and days listed before being sold – for more than 2,000 US cities.\nAll of the top ten were in the Northeast – a shift from last year when the Midwest dominated and Prairie Village, Kansas, was top.\nWest Chester – a ‘quaint’ town of about 20,000 people, which is just over an hour’s drive from Philadelphia – took over the crown, with a surge of page views on listings in the area.\nProspective homebuyers generally gravitated toward smaller cities in 2023, the report showed. Of the 10 most popular markets, only one – Manchester, New Hampshire – has a population of more than 100,000, and the majority are less than half that size.\nWest Chester, Pennsylvania , was the most ‘popular’ housing market in 2023, according to analysis from real estate marketplace Zillow\nZillow reported that a ‘strong interest’ in the West Chester area has helped push home values up about 8 percent in the last year.\nThe typical home in West Chester is worth about $584,000, putting it among the more expensive cities in Pennsylvania.\n‘But given its relative affordability compared to larger cities nearby such as New York City and Washington DC, those looking for a break from city life may see West Chester as an attractive and affordable place to call home,’ the report read.\nWest Chester ranked within the top 100 cities in page views per listing among the nearly 2,300 cities included in Zillow’s rankings, far outperforming its size.\nAlmost two thirds of those views came from outside the city, the analysis found, which is a possible signal of interest in moving in.\nAlthough West Chester took the top spot, seven of the 10 most popular markets of 2023 were located in New England.\nWest Chester – a ‘quaint’ town of about 20,000 people, which is just over an hour’s drive from Philadelphia – took the crown for the most ‘popular’ housing market in 2023\nNashua and Manchester in New Hampshire ranked second and third, followed by Connecticut’s Wethersfield and West Hartford in fourth and fifth place.\nStow, Ohio, came in sixth place, Middletown, Connecticut in seventh, and Twinsburg, Ohio, in eighth.\nZillow ranked Newington, Connecticut in ninth place and Concord, New Hampshire, rounded off the 10 most popular markets of 2023.\nThe real estate company also singled out some breakout towns in specific categories.\nIt ranked Chula Vista, California, which has a population of around 278,000 and a typical home value of $808,000, as the most popular large city in the US in 2023.\nSouth Portland, Maine, was the most popular seaside town, while Vermilion, Ohio, took the top spot among vacation towns.\nNorth Carolina’s Pinehurst edged out Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, for the top retirement town.\nWest Chester also ranked first among college towns, with Kent, Ohio, coming in just behind.\nIt comes as mortgage rates have fallen for the ninth consecutive week – offering much-needed respite to prospective homebuyers heading into the new year.\nMortgage rates have fallen for their ninth consecutive week, ending the year at their lowest point since May\nData from Government-backed lender Freddie Mac shows the average rate on a 30-year home loan is now 6.61 percent, down from 6.67 percent last week, and at its lowest point since May.\nIt is good news for home shoppers after rates soared to a peak of 7.79 percent in late October.\nHowever, the average buyer still faces paying around $800 per month more now on a home loan than if they had bought two years ago.",

    "text": "Avvicinarsi alla natura è il credo del fotografo e regista Vincent Munier . Ha viaggiato nelle regioni più remote, dai Poli al Tibet, e ha fotografato gli animali più selvaggi del Pianeta . Ma la sua nuova mostra \" En Forêt \", visitabile fino al 2025 al Musée des Confluences di Lione , è un tuffo nel cuore delle foreste vicino alle quali è cresciuto, nell' est della Francia . \"Ho imparato a pedinare e posso passarci giorni, ore. Sono totalmente posseduto da questo incontro, da questo desiderio di mettere in primo piano gli animali che abbiamo messo da parte . Questo è ciò che mi colpisce e mi rattrista di più, la misura in cui noi uomini abbiamo continuato da soli: 'l'uomo è uomo' e gli animali sono un po' uno spettacolo o un accessorio , ma non allo stesso livello. Una posizione verticale che mi dà enormemente fastidio, questa posizione egemonica della nostra specie rispetto alle altre \", spiega Munier ai microfoni di Euronews. Il mondo selvaggio viene rosicchiato dall’uomo, a scapito della diversità della flora e della fauna. Munier vuole mostrare la bellezza di questo Pianeta che stiamo consumando, sia dall'altra parte del mondo che a due passi da casa. \"È passato molto tempo, alcuni anni, dall'ultima volta che ho viaggiato, anche se normalmente è il mio lavoro, ma per provare a dimostrare che si può provare la stessa intensa emozione di fronte a un leopardo delle nevi come davanti a una lince , un gatto selvatico o talvolta anche una piccola cinciallegra... Ci sono cose che sembrano abbastanza ordinarie , ma quando presti molta attenzione , ti prendi il tuo tempo e metti tutto insieme - la luce e tutto il resto - diventano straordinarie! \".",

A protestor holds a placard during the End Bad Governance protest in Abuja on August 2, 2024. At least 13 people died during protests over economic hardship in Nigeria on Thursday, according to rights group Amnesty International, which accused security forces of killing peaceful demonstrators. Conflicting accounts emerged on the number of deaths a day after thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Nigeria to demonstrate against government policies and the high cost of living. (Photo by Kola Sulaimon / AFP)\nAmina Yusuf’s voice broke as she described her five-year-old son’s last moments.\nShe said Muhammad Sani was standing in the doorway at home in the northern city Kano when police opened fire on protesters taking part in hardship rallies that have rocked Nigeria.\nYusuf said her son was hit by gunfire and bled to death before she could get him to hospital.\n“I will never forgive the policeman who fired the shot that killed my child,” the 37-year-old mother told AFP.\nPirates defender in Nigeria squad for AFCON qualifiers Amnesty International says security forces killed at least 21 demonstrators in a crackdown on a week of protests over government policies and soaring living costs.\nPolice say seven people have died, but commanders say the police and army were not responsible for any deaths.\nAs the rallies ease, families are grappling with the loss of loved ones and calling for accountability.\nElsewhere in Kano’s Rijiyar Lemo neighbourhood, Ladidi Umar has been mourning the death of her 22-year-old son Bashir Lawan.\nShe told AFP he was killed by police gunfire in the crackdown on Saturday.\n“Bashir was shot in the leg and he fell. Instead of leaving him, the police also shot him in the abdomen, which was the fatal shot,” the 55-year-old mother said.\n“I demand that the policemen who deliberately shot and killed my son be found and made to face the consequences of their actions,” she said. “I want justice.”\nPolice in Kano have not responded to AFP’s requests for comment.\nBut they have announced they are investigating whether officers are to blame for deaths in Nigeria’s second largest city, which has seen some of the most intense violence since the rallies began.\n– Death of a ‘breadwinner’ –\nPolice say they have arrested hundreds of people on suspicion of “destruction, looting and instigating chaos” in Kano.\nAmnesty has accused officers across Nigeria of using live rounds and excessive force, and called for investigations into the conduct of security forces.\nIn an interview with AFP, Amnesty’s Nigeria director Isa Sanusi said the organisation had confirmed the killing of seven protesters by security forces in Kano’s Kurna and Kofar Nasarawa districts.\nHe said the nationwide toll represented a “conservative figure” and that Amnesty was investigating more deaths.\nMost of those the rights group recorded took place in northern Nigeria.\nAs protests quietened elsewhere, hundreds of people took to the streets earlier this week in the poorer north, which has borne the brunt of Nigeria’s worst economic crisis in a generation.\nFor families already suffering as living costs soar, the loss of relatives is overwhelming. Both mothers AFP spoke to called for the police to pay compensation.\n“One of our breadwinners is dead,” Umar said. “He died in the hands of the police and they should pay for his blood.”\nYusuf said “the police have not shown remorse by even coming to offer condolences for my loss.”\nShe described how affectionate her son was, and how he rarely left his mother’s side.\n“I demand justice and compensation,” she said. “I know it will not make up for the loss of my child, but it will lessen the pain.”\n© Agence France-Presse",

    "text": "The leadership of Harvard-Epworth Church, the venue that held the “People’s Commencement” following the pro-Palestine walkout at Harvard’s graduation, said they were angered and dismayed that the church became the site of a large-scale protest, according to a Friday email sent to the church’s congregation.\nMitch Hay and Barb Lemmel, the pastors of the church, wrote in a joint email that they did not grant Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine permission to host the protest and were under the impression that they rented out the venue to a “small student group” to honor the 13 undergraduates who were barred from graduating .\n“The protest in the sanctuary was in no way approved by Harvard-Epworth,” Hay and Lemmel wrote.\n“We are dismayed that the church became the locus of a large student protest. We are angered that this overly political message took place in the sanctuary. We are troubled that we were not present to provide in-person leadership, as we are currently in Italy on vacation,” they added.\nDuring the pro-Palestine alternative graduation , HOOP organizer and Harvard Law School graduate Lea H. Kayali told attendees that the church was “generously offered” to organizers for the ceremony.\nBut Lemmel wrote in a Saturday statement to The Crimson that church leadership were not informed of the “People’s Commencement,” of any impending demonstrations, or of HOOP’s involvement.\n“We would not have allowed banners to be hung on the altar or flags of any nation to be displayed or waved in the sanctuary” Lemmel wrote. “We are dismayed at the lack of awareness and respect for our sacred space.”\nMore than 1,000 people walked out of Harvard’s Commencement as interim University President Alan M. Garber ’76 began to confer degrees on graduating students.\nAdvertisement Many of those who participated in the walkout later marched to Harvard-Epworth Church, where they staged the alternative graduation event to honor the 13 students prevented from graduating over their participation in the 20-day encampment in Harvard Yard that ended earlier this month.\nLemmel wrote on Saturday that the student who rented Harvard-Epworth for the “People’s Commencement” had rented the space in the past for a different Harvard student group, and the church’s administration assumed the student was renting it for the same organization.\n“Today, however, I’ve received an email from her saying that she did not rent on this group’s behalf,” Lemmel wrote.\nHOOP wrote in a statement that “the student who made the request to the church made clear that the space was being reserved on behalf of Harvard students and community members who wished to celebrate the 13 seniors being denied their degrees and to mourn the loss of Palestinian lives.”\n“The church may have assumed that this student was reserving space on behalf of an organization they have previously reserved space for, although the student did not, at any time, indicate that this was the case,” HOOP added.\nIn the email to their congregation, Hay and Lemmel noted that Harvard-Epworth has a long history of serving as a forum for “difficult conversations about controversial issues when bounded by mutual respect and listening,” they wrote that the “nationalistic tone of this demonstration was not in keeping with our values as a house of worship.”\nIn an emailed statement to The Crimson, HOOP praised the “on-the-ground staff” at the church as “incredibly welcoming, warm, and supportive.”\nWhile HOOP wrote in its statement that the number of people who attended the protest graduation ceremony “exceeded our expectations,” it did not address the church’s claims that the protest was unauthorized and that its leadership was misled by organizers.\nHOOP wrote that Harvard-Epworth staff “offered us the church space, including the sanctuary, as well as an additional 170 chairs for overflow seating.”\n“We are grateful to the beautiful faith community of Harvard-Epworth for opening their doors to us, for enabling us to celebrate the students unjustly punished by the Harvard administration, and for uplifting Palestinian voices,” HOOP added.\nAdvertisement —Staff writer Elyse C.

    "text": "在孩子王平台购买“神仙水”，“收到时漏得到处都是，液体没有标志性酵母味，而是酒精味，”对比专柜颜色、气味、瓶身多处不同，赵女士质疑买到假货。\n在孩子王购买的“神仙水”（左）比免税店买的同款颜色浅淡\n消费者反映——\n“神仙水”没有臭味而是酒精味，质疑买到假货\n家住陕西西安的赵女士告诉华商报大风新闻记者，3月16日，她在孩子王全球购自营旗舰店买了一瓶SK-II护肤精华露，也就是俗称的“神仙水”，230ml装，实付598.96元。“这瓶‘神仙水’我收到时候，它就是漏的，当时就跟客服反映了，但嫌退货麻烦就留下了。越用越奇怪，一股酒精味，皮肤也变得粗糙发黑，以前用完都会越来越细腻。”赵女士说，6月份，刚好去三亚旅行，为了对比，就在免税店SK-II专柜也买了一瓶同样规格的“神仙水”，结果发现颜色、味道完全不同。“免税店买的‘神仙水’就是应有的臭口水味儿，其主要成分是酵母，正常闻着是臭臭的，而在孩子王买的这瓶是刺鼻的酒精味，这分明是假的，因为‘神仙水’就不含酒精。”\n订单详情\n6月14日，赵女士找孩子王全球购自营旗舰店客服沟通此事，“我发了对比图，客服一眼就认出哪个是他们的，承认他们“神仙水”颜色浅，跟我买的正品不一样。但客服说是因版本不同，让我提供了批号，还给发来报关单，报关单上也不显示批次等，只显示他们进了300瓶，那咋能证明我买的这瓶就是在这300瓶之内的？”赵女士说，此前在孩子王还买过一次“神仙水”，那瓶也是正常的酵母味儿，这次严重怀疑买到假货了，“客服说会补偿给我一张30元优惠券，我拒绝了，平台还是硬给我塞了5块钱优惠券。”\n客服回应截图\n更让赵女士担心的是，自己多年来一直在孩子王平台购物，而且大多是买孩子的东西，“我还给娃买过奶粉，现在回想都后怕，孩子吃的更不敢想，以后再也不会在这上面买东西了。”\n记者调查——\n对比专柜货品细节多处不同，多平台SK-II称“神仙水”不含酒精\n7月2日，华商报大风新闻记者在社媒上搜索发现，赵女士的经历并不是个例，早在2023年就有人发帖称在孩子王全球购买的海蓝之谜精粹水，液体、味道、商标都不一样，价格也很便宜，质疑买到假货。\n在孩子王买的神仙水（左）和免税店买的同款，瓶身文字笔画粗细不一致\n7月2日，华商报大风新闻记者对比赵女士提供的两瓶“神仙水”发现，都为日本制造，粗略一看没啥区别，细看有多处不同。孩子王的液体颜色浅，免税店颜色更黄一些。瓶身上文字内容虽一致，笔画粗细等却不一样。正面“PITERA”字样的凹痕，孩子王的更粗，边缘更模糊一些；背面“护肤精华露”等说明字样，孩子王笔画更细；底部一圈锯齿纹路，孩子王的锯齿短一些；生产日期数字写法也有区别，数字“1”“2”尤为明显。\n在赵女士购买的链接上，记者看到，该款“神仙水”目前售价519元，产品页面有正品保障字样，目前在售的“神仙水”为瓶身字样内容与赵女士购买的不一样。版本识别提示称，进口商品生产厂家不一样，所以存在产地、批次、包装、外观细节差异。\n记者看到，“神仙水”官方售价为1690元/230ml，记者联系多个平台的SK-II官方旗舰店，客服均表示，“神仙水”中蕴含超过90%的PITERA ，是由天然酵母发酵产生的酵母精华，人工是无法合成的, 不添加酒精、香精等其他化学成分。\n孩子王客服——\n报关单有瓶身对应批次号，对不上须本人询问\n7月2日下午，华商报大风新闻记者联系到孩子王官方客服，工作人员查看后说，赵女士之前反映过买到假“神仙水”一事，有专员对接处理了，但如何处理涉及客户隐私，无法告知。\n那么，赵女士购买的“神仙水”是否为假货？工作人员说，赵女士有疑虑，他们可以提供产品相关凭证，之前提供的报关单上有产品批次号，“赵女士可核对看瓶身上的批次号是否一致，同一样产品在报关单上都是一个批次号，如果批次号相同，就说明是正品。这都是经过海关检验的，批次号一致才能通关。”\n“神仙水”瓶身底部批次号与报关单上的不一致\n记者看到，赵女士所购“神仙水”瓶身底部批次号，与客服此前提供的报关单上“神仙水”一项对应有两串数字均不符。对此，工作人员说，后台图片无法放大，看不到批次号具体是哪个号码，“你就在瓶身找，没有对应的号码就让本人来电，不是本人无法回答。”\n那么，赵女士购买的“神仙水”是从哪进口的？工作人员说有对应的供应商，产品都是厂家集中采购的，从哪采购进口的并不清楚，还要核实。\n华商报大风新闻记者 佘欣 编辑 李婧\n责任编辑：李超_NB12814",
