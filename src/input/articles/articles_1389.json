Además, agregó que hay un presupuesto aproximado de dos mil millones de pesos para repartir durante los capítulos. ¿Los colombianos del común participarán? Como novedad, la producción decidió darles la posibilidad a los televidentes de pasar de la sala de su casa a realizar los circuitos; por lo que habrá un Desafiante de la Semana, quien repercutirá positiva o negativamente en el equipo que represente. Esta fue la razón por la que se hicieron dos convocatorias. Se sabe que se recibieron 20 mil inscripciones para 32 cupos y una sorpresa. ¿Quién es la Anfitriona del Desafío 20 años?

    "text": "Opponents criticise Libero Quotidiano for naming Italian PM 'man of the year'Ms Meloni has won 'the war of the sexes', newspaper says in editorialThe article was written by her former head of public relations Mario Sechi\nItaly’s first female prime minister Giorgia Meloni has been named ‘Man of the Year’ by a far-right newspaper, prompting an outcry from political opponents.\nMs Meloni, 46, was awarded the honour by the Libero Quotidiano daily because she had won ‘the war of the sexes’ in Italy, the paper adding that she had ‘not only broken the glass ceiling, she dissolved it.’\nAlongside a photo of the prime minister – a growing ally of UK PM Rishi Sunak – in a double-breasted white blazer with her arms folded behind her back, it said she had ‘passed the test of 2023’.\nThe article, described by one female opponent as a ‘surrender’ to the idea politics is only for men, was written by Mario Sechi, Libero’s Rome bureau chief and a former head of Ms Meloni’s public relations team until September this year.\nHe wrote: ‘In our society of weak thinking, we have recognised strong ideas. In excessive diversity, we have reversed gender. In times of war, we have chosen someone who has shown she knows how to fight.’\nGiorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, has been named ‘Man of the Year’ by a right-wing newspaper in the country\nLibero Quotidiano said she had ‘passed the test of 2023’, praising her for winning ‘the war of the sexes’\nMs Meloni has become a key international ally of UK prime minister Rishi Sunak as he has taken the party further to the right (pictured: Mr Sunak meeting Ms Meloni earlier this month)\nSechi’s editorial praised Ms Meloni for winning ‘the war of the sexes…thinking differently, being divergent, overcoming the arrogance of males and the defeatism of females.’\nBut political opponents, particularly women, have called on her to distance herself from the award.\nIn remarks reported by the Telegraph, Elly Schlein, secretary of the centre-left Democratic Party, said: ‘Today a right-wing newspaper is explaining to us that politics and power are for men.\nElly Schlein, secretary of the centre-left Democratic Party, said: ‘Today a right-wing newspaper is explaining to us that politics and power are for men.\n‘I don’t think my aspiration as a politician is to become man of the year. On the contrary, I think this is a surrender.’\nElisabetta Piccolotti, an MP from the Alleanza Verdi e Sinistra (Greens and Left Alliance), said the cover was ‘an affirmation of male superiority’.\nShe called on Ms Meloni to reject it, adding on Facebook: ‘At this point, prime minister, please clarify: are you a woman, are you a man or are you non-binary?’\nOthers took to social media to post memes that appeared to poke fun at the a female prime minister being named ‘man of the year’.\nBut Italian culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, a former deputy director of Libero, told journalists that the title was well-deserved.\nMs Meloni, who became prime minister in October 2022, leads the right-wing populist Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) party, which promotes traditional family values and a crackdown on immigration while opposing euthanasia, abortion and same-sex marriage.\nShe has become a key international ally of Rishi Sunak as he has taken the Conservatives further to the right under his leadership with a desire for tougher action on migrants in Europe.\nThe pair met in Rome earlier this month where they were seen to share a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek, before Mr Sunak spoke at a gathering of Italian conservatives and right-wingers on immigration.\nHe told the meeting that criminal gangs were wielding migration as a ‘weapon…to try to destabilise our society’, amidst an ongoing battle to push through his Rwanda bill that would see asylum seekers arriving in the UK sent to the African country.\nMs Meloni has not commented on the Libero Quotidiano article.",

    "title": "AI’s Groundbreaking Journey in 2023: Transforming Healthcare, Business, and Media”",
    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making significant strides in various fields, and 2023 has been a pivotal year in showcasing its potential and impact. From healthcare innovations to advancements in entertainment and business, AI has demonstrated its versatility and transformative power. This article provides an overview of key developments in AI over the past year, underscoring how this technology is reshaping industries and influencing societal norms. AI in healthcare in a leap forward One of the most notable achievements of AI in 2023 was in the healthcare sector. Researchers and medical professionals have increasingly relied on AI for diagnosing diseases, personalizing treatments, and even predicting patient outcomes with greater accuracy. A breakthrough was the use of AI in treating ultrasonic brain illnesses, as reported by AniNews.in. This advancement has significantly reduced barriers to treatment, offering hope for more effective management of neurological conditions. Moreover, startups have been actively utilizing AI to predict responses to cancer drugs, as highlighted by The Wall Street Journal. This approach has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment by tailoring therapies to individual patient needs, thus improving treatment efficacy and reducing side effects. AI’s impact on business and the economy AI’s influence extends beyond healthcare into the realms of business and economy. Microsoft’s AI developments have been likened to an ‘iPhone moment’, suggesting a major shift in the company’s trajectory and impact on the tech industry. As reported by Proactive Investors (US), this upgrade in Microsoft’s AI capabilities indicates a significant leap in how businesses can leverage AI for innovation and efficiency. Additionally, Forbes’ review of 2023 highlights AI’s role in various sectors, including risk management, hybrid work models, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. AI’s ability to analyze vast amounts of data and provide insights has been invaluable for companies navigating complex market dynamics and evolving work environments. AI in entertainment and media The entertainment industry has also felt AI’s influence. ‘Gutfeld!’ discussed how AI actors could potentially address issues in Hollywood, suggesting a future where AI-generated performances might become commonplace. This development, covered by The Wrap (Video), opens up new possibilities for content creation, potentially reshaping the entertainment landscape. In the realm of intellectual property, AI’s role has sparked discussions, as seen in “Copyright in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” by Mind Matters. The conversation revolves around the legal and ethical implications of AI-generated content, highlighting the need for new frameworks to address these emerging challenges. Challenges and ethical considerations Despite its numerous benefits, AI’s rapid development has raised important questions about ethics and regulation. Issues such as data privacy, bias in AI algorithms, and the potential for misuse remain key concerns. Publications like JD Supra have emphasized the importance of navigating compliance trends and establishing a corporate culture of integrity in the age of AI. The New York Times’ lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, as reported by various sources, underscores the complexities of AI concerning copyright laws. This case is a clear indicator of the legal challenges that lie ahead as AI continues to evolve and intersect with various aspects of society. The advancements in AI during 2023 have been remarkable, showcasing the technology’s potential to revolutionize multiple sectors. From healthcare to entertainment, AI’s applications are vast and varied, offering solutions to complex problems and opening up new possibilities. However, as AI continues to develop, it is crucial to address the accompanying ethical and legal challenges to ensure its benefits are maximized while minimizing potential harm. The progress made in 2023 sets the stage for further innovations and discussions in the years to come, marking an exciting era in the evolution of artificial intelligence.",

Some of the pets did not survive the fire. Photo by Amy MacMillan\nWAYNE — A mother and her seven children escaped an early Wednesday morning fire that destroyed their home at 78 Berry Road. The home was owned by Vicki Tully.\nOne of the children, Haven, 15, woke the rest of the family up after the fire had started and helped them evacuate. No injuries were reported.\nInitial investigators on the scene found the fire was likely accidental, Wayne Fire Chief Taylor Stevenson said. The fire, he said, started in a garage attached to the house.\nAn early Wednesday morning fire destroyed a home at 78 Berry Road in Wayne. The home owned by Vicki Tully housed Tully, her seven children and several pets. Some of the pets did not survive the fire. Photo by Amy MacMillan\nThe Wayne Fire Department received a call about the fire at 12:56 a.m. and cleared the scene at 7:40 a.m. The department’s mutual aid partners in Readfield, Fayette, Mount Vernon, Vienna, Winthrop and Livermore Falls also responded to the fire.\nA nearby barn that housed the family’s three horses was not impacted by the fire. The horses escaped the barn during the fire, but were later found safe. The family’s two goats, three of their seven dogs, three of their six barn cats and one of their three house cats survived the fire.\nStevenson said a nearby resident with an excavator helped clear some of the structure while the fire was still ongoing, a standard practice in older buildings that are unlikely to recover from the fire. Though the fire started in the garage, he said, it had spread to the rest of the house and was difficult to extinguish without knocking through the building.\nA GoFundMe set up by Amy MacMillan for the Tully family’s recovery had raised more than $4,600 from 67 donations by Thursday afternoon.",

    "text": "Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez (CNS/Pablo Esparza) The Vatican’s doctrine chief has delivered a pointed critique of gender ideology at a theological conference in Germany. Source: CNA.\nCardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, prefect of the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, addressed scholars on Monday at the Cologne School of Catholic Theology (KHKT) about gender ideology’s “claim to omnipotence”.\nSpeaking in German via video link, the cardinal rejected the notion that gender and bodily identity could be subject to radical change based on individual wishes and claims to freedom.\nTransgender surgery, he argued, goes beyond mere external changes like cosmetic surgery, as it involves “the claim to a change of identity, to the desire to be a different person”.\nCardinal Fernández criticised using technical means to “create an alternative reality at will”.\nWhile acknowledging the existence of severe cases of dysphoria that could lead to “an unbearable life”, he emphasised that such exceptional situations require careful evaluation.\n“No anthropology regarding the human person equals that of the Church,” Cardinal Fernández told the conference.\nThe Argentine cardinal referenced the dicastery’s recent document Dignitas Infinita on human dignity, explaining the concept inspired by Pope John Paul II’s words in 1980 in Osnabrück, Germany.\n“God has shown us in an insurmountable way in Jesus Christ how much he loves each man and how immense is the dignity that he has conferred on him through him. Precisely those who must suffer from some physical or spiritual impediment must recognise themselves as friends of Jesus, as loved especially by him,” Cardinal Fernández said, quoting St John Paul II.\nThe conference, titled “The Catholic Foundation of Human Dignity,” aims to engage Catholic theology with other sciences and worldviews, KHKT Rector Fr Christoph Ohly told Vatican News.\n“With the topic of human dignity and human rights, we have a theme that concerns not just Christians but every human being,” Fr Ohly said.\nFULL STORY\nVatican doctrine chief warns against ‘claim to omnipotence’ of gender ideology (By AC Wimmer, CNA )",

    "text": "Acapulco se fortalece con turismo durante Año Nuevo tras afectaciones por Huracán Otis Viajeros provenientes principalmente del Valle de México han revitalizado las actividades en Acapulco, que estuvieron casi paralizadas desde el pasado 25 de octubre, fecha del impacto del huracán \"Otis\". Este fin de semana, la ciudad reportó una disponibilidad de 4 mil 500 cuartos de hotel, con una ocupación del 71%, según cifras oficiales. La familias también optaron por viajar en caravana y alquilar casas y departamentos que sufrieron pocos daños. A pesar de los restos visibles en la Zona Diamante, disfrutaron del mar. La afluencia de turistas se hizo evidente desde el viernes pasado, con vehículos procedentes de la Ciudad de México, Estado de México y Morelos circulando por la carrera Escénica y la Costera Miguel Alemán. El Hotel Bali-Hai, uno de los pocos que continuó operando tras el huracán, informó una ocupación del 60% por turistas recién llegados y el restante por trabajadores dedicados a la reconstrucción. El huracán \"Otis\", categoría 5, azotó Acapulco con vientos sostenidos de 270 kilómetros por hora y ráfagas de más de 300. Aunque Playa Bonfil sufrió daños considerables, bañistas perseveraron, adaptándose a las nuevas condiciones.

    "text": "The report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries also played an important role in averting the crisis.\nThe Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said.\nAmid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN.\n\"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" the senior administration official said.\nUS officials say that outreach and public statements from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis.\n\"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\" CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying.\n\"I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\" the senior administration official added. \"I can&apos;t demonstrate this positively, but I think that&apos;s our assessment.\"\nRegarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\nIn a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that \"this is not the era of war\" on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India.\nDuring this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place \"in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,\" the senior administration official said.\nNotably, late summer 2022 was also proving a &apos;devastating period&apos; for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia&apos;s biggest prize since the invasion.\nAs these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a \"potential trigger\" for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN.\nAlso, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new \"false flag story\" about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack.\nIn October 2022, Russia&apos;s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.\"\nBut, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported.\n\"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\" a senior administration official said. \"And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would&apos;ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.\"\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

    "title": "Exposing the silent hatred that ties MAGA to anti-democratic movements throughout our history...",
    "text": "Many theories have been advanced to determine the nature of the ties holding the MAGA coalition together all these years. To be clear, the spell has yet to be broken, the current race pitting MAGA against democracy, we are told, is still too close to call. There is a feeling, however, that its tired message is getting old and dated. Hardcore MAGA adherents will be the last ones off the island, but already we are witnessing some “MAGA adjacents” scurrying for the lifeboats. Autocratic delusions have visited our politics time and again throughout our history. They have come using many names, MAGA being the latest incarnation. However, the common platform MAGA strategists employ to define itself is highly derivative. It always involves grievance and fear of a diminishing status among their group. Trump’s saddled MAGA on the backs of immigrants ever since his opening gambit in 2016 and is using them, yet again, in this campaign. Haitians have replaced Mexicans in this iteration but the playbook remains the same. Make them a threat so we can fear them. Immigration is a valid issue, but one that deserves some context. Those standing at our borders are not the enemy no matter how the right frames the issue. They are all like most of our ancestors looking for an opportunity. Our status as a nation of immigrants is the thing, in large part, that has distinguished us from other nations. Most of us are all sons and daughters of immigrants. Native Americans and enslaved blacks have had good reason to fear our forefathers and their dreams of expansion and riches. Still, the MAGA movement borrows heavily from the historically debunked theories that have cropped up as responses to real threats to our national security. Last century they came dressed as American Firsters and isolationists preceding both World Wars in deference to Nazis and European authoritarians. After the wars, they hid beneath the veneer of anti-communism and anti-government states’ rights advocates— their real agenda always hidden under a thin patina of anti-semitism, racism, and white supremacy. American Isolationists or America Firsters suggest that the United States can effectively cut itself off from the rest of the world— a mistaken illusion that denies our founding principles. America has the rest of the world woven into its very fabric. Immigrants have been a source of our economic and cultural hegemony in the world since the Mayflower dropped anchor off the shore of Massachusetts: Such ardor for territorial expansion across North America and commercial activism beyond the nation’s shores has prompted some scholars of U.S. foreign policy to dismiss the notion that the United States ever was isolationist. Historian Robert Kagan argues that the United States was a “dangerous nation” from the start and that Americans have always pursued “aggressive expansionism” and “acquisitive materialism.” Political scientist Bear Braumoeller calls U.S. isolationism a “myth,” maintaining that even during the 1920s, after the United States had refused to enter the League of Nations and pulled away from strategic engagement in Europe and East Asia, the nation was deeply engaged abroad, adroitly using its commercial and financial strength—“banks rather than tanks”—to pursue its objectives. — Council of Foreign Relations, “An Anatomy of Isolationism” Such ardor for territorial expansion across North America and commercial activism beyond the nation’s shores has prompted some scholars of U.S. foreign policy to dismiss the notion that the United States ever was isolationist.

Within that group, a recurrent recidivist core of right-wing extremists uses this as cover for spates of racist hatred. What Washington alluded to has been seized on by them to suggest an undifferentiated notion of isolationism. Washington’s warning that we should steer clear of 18th-century European affairs was uttered within the context of a European political environment that included petty disagreements going back centuries. Washington wisely believed our independence from European masters required distancing from continental politics. Meanwhile, it was those very conditions and the failures of European governments that drove the mid-to-late 19th-century immigration of Europeans to America. The cultural differences separating European states aligned with the general weariness of poor and long-suffering and governments that served their interests poorly roused their interest in a “new world” an ocean away. The indifference to their plight by the rich and powerful was a motivator for large groups of immigrants braving the long journey to an America that could only offer them opportunity. And like today’s immigrants, for them opportunity was enough. Most of us are beneficiaries of their bravery and vision. The isolationist threads that hold parts of the MAGA movement together are rather weak. Trump’s latest riff is one that includes a warning that a Harris-Walz administration would continue our strong support of Ukraine and that would likely lead to our sending American troops to help defend an ally. The annoying truth hidden within Trump’s claim is his personal interest in a Russian victory and the threat Russia poses to NATO. Putin‘s naked aggression in invading an independent nation exposes the likelihood that ignoring Russian aggression in Ukraine would represent a threat to our NATO allies which includes our vital national interests. Both Putin and Trump share a desire for the breakup of the essential alliance of democracies in opposition to autocrats like Putin. In a New York Times guest opinion article, Thomas Edsall writes about Trump’s followers and the mystery of their affiliation with him: Trump has remained a powerful, if not dominant, political figure by weaving together a tapestry of resentment and victimhood. He has tapped into a bloc of voters for whom truth is irrelevant. The Trump coalition is driven to some extent by white males suffering status decline, but the real glue holding his coalition together is arguably racial animus and general resentment toward minorities. — NYTimes, “The Real Trump Mystery,” by Thomas B. Edsall Trump has remained a powerful, if not dominant, political figure by weaving together a tapestry of resentment and victimhood. He has tapped into a bloc of voters for whom truth is irrelevant. The Trump coalition is driven to some extent by white males suffering status decline, but the real glue holding his coalition together is arguably racial animus and general resentment toward minorities. — NYTimes, “The Real Trump Mystery,” by Thomas B. Edsall Edsall explores the secret behind the allegiance between Trump and the right-wing faction that goes deeper than the ardor of Hillary’s deplorables or the grifting behind the MAGA merch-a-thons. The hate that fuels Trump has been a constant evil that lives within America’s origin story. It was there when the founders signed on to the agreement that was based on a compromise that allowed slavery to live on as an American outrage. After a bitter war fought to end slavery, the ensuing racial hatred remains alive within the MAGA core. It was present at the indiscriminate destruction of Native American cultures and the resultant genocide of their people. The same antipathy has been behind the fight against suffrage and the ERA. It is now extended to rights owed to LGBTQ+ citizens and focused on the denial of women’s reproductive rights. America’s saving grace has always been in the margins. The margins that still hold keeping Trump and his most ardent followers at bay. Margins that allow us to proudly point to our success in perfecting our democracy through legislation and court decisions. The white nationalists, neo-Nazis, KKK members, misogynists, the 1950s McCarthyites, America Firsters, et.al. have always been at the core of the ad hoc movements they create— all of them expedient to the moment, hidden within a cultish clique of easily outraged followers. Edsall goes on to quote from a 2021 paper written by the political scientists Lilliana Mason, Julie Wronski, and John V. Kane that may explain the dynamics of movements throughout our history and why they fail: Mason, Wronski and Kane analyzed data collected by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group from polls in which “respondents were asked to indicate their feelings toward these four Democratic-aligned social groups.” The result? Animosity toward Democratic-linked groups is strongly related to Trump approval. People who felt strong animosity toward Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and L.G.B.T. people were significantly more likely to be fond of Trump. Interestingly, though, “feelings of animosity toward Democratic groups do not predict favorability toward the Republican Party, Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell,” Mason, Wronski and Kane wrote. Instead, “Trump support is uniquely predicted by animosity toward marginalized groups in the United States.” — NYTimes, Edsall Mason, Wronski and Kane analyzed data collected by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group from polls in which “respondents were asked to indicate their feelings toward these four Democratic-aligned social groups.” The result?

Instead, “Trump support is uniquely predicted by animosity toward marginalized groups in the United States.” — NYTimes, Edsall Like a math equation, the writers have calculated the motivating factors that unite Trump’s core support, and perhaps have found the secret of why these movements are embedded among extreme conservative groups within the Republican Party. The straight line from one to the other is determined by a pronounced and predictable set of prejudices that never change. Their hatred outpaces any proposed “love of country” excuse they may use to disguise their anti-democratic leanings. These groups were always antithetical to America’s promise to all the “others” who inhabit their list of unworthies— women, immigrants, blacks, LGBTQs, and the liberal elites who have supported them. Trump and his base remain the enemy within— the fallen angels of our natures whom Lincoln alluded to in his First Inaugural Address: \"I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\" and while they didn’t prevail, the damage they inflicted on the nation continues. MAGA is nothing more than our fallen angels coalescing around newfound hatred and bigotry. They target the weak and disabled, the latest immigrant group, women, and those among us who need protection from the likes of them. They are a movement always in search of the right leader: ...Though they may remain relatively latent when leaders and parties draw attention elsewhere, the right leader can activate these attitudes and fold them into voters’ political judgments. — “Activating Animus: the Uniquely Social Roots of Trump Support,” by Lilliana Mason, Julie Wronski, and John V. Kan, 2021 ...Though they may remain relatively latent when leaders and parties draw attention elsewhere, the right leader can activate these attitudes and fold them into voters’ political judgments. — “Activating Animus: the Uniquely Social Roots of Trump Support,” by Lilliana Mason, Julie Wronski, and John V. Kan, 2021 Donald Trump is the latest in a long line of autocrat hopefuls who view our democracy as an inconvenient impediment to the imposition of their will. They are not new. Donald Trump is not a better or more effective version, but let us not mistake the truth that each incursion makes uncomfortably clear, the enemy is not foreign. It lives and is sustained from within the deep recesses of our national psyche. The words of James Baldwin suggest why we pretend to be shocked each time our past transgressions give rise to another outbreak of unremitting hate. The alternative is far more difficult to live with. Self-hate is our private atonement for the pain we have brought upon ourselves.",
