    "text": "El presidente panameño, [José Raúl Mulino](https://www.prensa.com/tema/jose-raul-mulino/), dijo este jueves, 24 de octubre, que planea viajar a inicios de 2025 a España, Alemania y Portugal, en el marco de la campaña para sacar a Panamá de la lista negra de paraísos fiscales de la Unión Europea (UE) que lo llevó esta semana a Francia, donde cumplió una “misión exitosa”. La visita a París, que incluyó un encuentro con el gobernante francés, Emmanuel Macron, “cumplió por completo el cometido” en cuanto al tema de la listas, ya que se obtuvo el apoyo del líder galo para apoyar los esfuerzos de Panamá de salir de la lista negra de la UE, lo que “es bien importante porque Francia es un país líder” en esa región, dijo Mulino. ”Estaremos organizando para los primeros meses del año (2025) una gira por Alemania, España y Portugal, con el ánimo de seguir tocando base en todos estos gobiernos que tienen un rol importante en la UE”, y seguir con la campaña contra la presencia de Panamá en listas discriminatorias, añadió el gobernante durante su conferencia de prensa semanal. El presidente Macron manifestó el lunes su apoyo a que Panamá, que salió en octubre de 2023 de la lista gris del Grupo de Acción Financiera Internacional (GAFI, con sede en París), sea excluida de la lista de paraísos fiscales de la UE. ”Francia saluda las reformas llevadas a cabo por Panamá junto al Fórum mundial de la OCDE y la Comisión Europea en vistas de una salida rápida de la lista (de paraíso) fiscal europea y apoyará ese proceso”, indicó un comunicado conjunto emitido por la Presidencia francesa tras la reunión. En este sentido, Mulino señaló que el Gobierno de Macron “se comprometió a apoyar a Panamá en los esfuerzos del Foro Global y de la Comisión Europea para lograr una salida rápida de la lista fiscal europea y apoyará en ese proceso”.",

    "text": "TORONTO — Commuters across the Greater Toronto Area and parts of eastern Ontario had to contend with blowing snow and slippery sidewalks while heading home Friday evening as a blast of wintery weather hit parts of the province. Environment Canada has placed a region stretching from Hamilton all the way east past Kingston, Ont., under snowfall warnings, saying it was predicting up to 15 centimetres of snow. The weather agency says the snow is expected to continue into the evening and then is set to taper off from west to east late in the night. It warns the snowfall could have \"significant impact\" on the evening commute, making for low visibility and potentially slick roadways. Environment Canada has said peak snowfall rates of two centimetres per hour are possible. It says surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. The agency says people should be ready to adjust their driving with changing road conditions. It says drivers should turn on their lights and maintain a safe following distance if visibility is reduced while driving. Other parts of Ontario, including Windsor and London, are under a weather advisory, with between five and 10 centimetres of snow in the forecast.

    "title": "NAB's $751K CDR Penalty: A Regulatory Crossroads for Banking and Fintech",
    "text": "NAB's $751K CDR Penalty: A Regulatory Crossroads for Banking and Fintech\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) $751,200 penalty against National Australia Bank (NAB) for breaching the Consumer Data Right (CDR) rules marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Open Banking. The fine, the largest imposed under the CDR framework to date, underscores a growing regulatory emphasis on data accuracy and transparency—trends that will reshape investment opportunities in financial services. For investors, the penalty signals a clear bifurcation: banks must now prioritize robust data governance to avoid escalating compliance risks, while fintechs with clean data pipelines stand to capitalize on market share gains.\nThe Penalty's Underlying Risks: A Systemic Shift in Banking Compliance\nNAB's missteps were straightforward yet costly. The ACCC found the bank failed to disclose or accurately provide credit limit data in four instances, directly undermining fintech tools like mortgage broking platforms that rely on such data to streamline loan applications. The penalties—$187,800 per breach—reflect the ACCC's zero-tolerance approach, with maximum fines rising to $198,000 per violation as of November 2024. This upward trajectory in penalties, coupled with the CDR's expansion to non-bank lending by mid-2026, creates a high-stakes environment for financial institutions.\nInvestors should note that NAB's cooperation and subsequent remediation efforts likely mitigated reputational damage. However, the penalty's timing—amid a 135% surge in CDR usage by consumers since late 2023—reveals a market increasingly dependent on seamless data sharing. Banks that lag in data accuracy risk not only fines but also losing customers to competitors with better-integrated services.\nFintechs: The Winners in a Data-Driven Landscape\nThe NAB case highlights a golden opportunity for fintechs. Services like mortgage comparison platforms, which depend on accurate credit data, now have a lever to push banks toward compliance. Firms like RateCity or RateSetter, which leverage CDR data to offer tailored financial products, could see their value proposition strengthened as regulators penalize non-compliant banks.\nMoreover, fintechs with strong partnerships to compliant institutions—or those building their own data governance frameworks—will likely outperform. Consider companies like Xinja (Australia's first fully digital bank) or Afterpay, which have already invested in scalable compliance systems. Their ability to navigate the CDR's requirements positions them to capture market share from legacy banks struggling with legacy systems.\nInvestment Implications: Focus on Governance and Partnerships\nInvestors should prioritize two key criteria:\n1. Data Governance Strength: Firms with transparent data pipelines and proactive compliance teams (e.g., those already addressing CDR requirements) are better insulated from regulatory shocks.\n2. Strategic Partnerships: Fintechs allied with banks that have demonstrated compliance (or have the resources to do so) will benefit as Open Banking expands.\nAvoid institutions with poor data management track records. NAB's penalty, while isolated, serves as a warning: banks with outdated systems face both financial penalties and customer attrition. Meanwhile, the ACCC's emphasis on “data quality as critical to consumer empowerment” suggests that future enforcement actions will target firms failing to meet these standards.\nThe Bottom Line: Compliance is the New Competitiveness\nThe NAB penalty isn't just a regulatory milestone—it's a market signal. For banks, the cost of non-compliance is rising, and the stakes are existential. For fintechs, it's a clarion call to lean into partnerships and data rigor. Investors ignoring this shift risk backing laggards in an increasingly data-driven financial ecosystem.\nThe ACCC's actions make one thing clear: in the Open Banking era, the winners are those who treat data accuracy as a core competency, not an afterthought.\nData to watch: Track the ACCC's enforcement actions across sectors and the volume of CDR data requests—both are leading indicators of compliance trends.\nInvestment Thesis: Favor fintechs with robust data governance (e.g., Xinja, RateCity) and banks demonstrating proactive compliance (e.g., Commonwealth Bank, which has invested in CDR-ready systems). Avoid institutions with legacy systems and poor regulatory records. The CDR's expansion to non-bank lending in 2026 will amplify these dynamics—investors should position now.",
