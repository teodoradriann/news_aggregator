    "title": "Trump requests dismissal of January 6 case over Jack Smith\\u0027s appointment",
    "text": "Smith was not confirmed by the Senate but was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Attorneys for former President Donald Trump on Thursday asked a judge to dismiss the January 6 case against him, arguing that special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutionally appointed, according to The Hill . Smith was not confirmed by the Senate but was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Smith has been leading two investigations into the former president, including a classified documents case that was dismissed earlier this year. However Smith is appealing the dismissal. The request was made to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C., and centers around the same argument made in the classified documents case. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that no legal statue gave Garland the authority to give Smith the amount of power he has as special counsel, and that the appointment violated the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution. Trump's lawyers claimed that Smith was appointed by Garland as a \"private citizen.\" “The proposed motion establishes that this unjust case was dead on arrival — unconstitutional even before its inception,” Trump’s attorneys wrote on Thursday. \"Everything that Smith did since Attorney General Garland’s appointment, as President Trump continued his leading campaign against President Biden and then Vice President Harris, was unlawful and unconstitutional.\" Trump is currently facing four charges in D.C., related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Smith has until Oct. 31 to file a response. Misty Severi is an evening news reporter for Just The News. You can follow her on X for more coverage.",

    "text": "L’augurio di Pasqua di questo anno “ha il sapore della parola Pace. Siamo in guerra, dentro alla ‘terza guerra mondiale a pezzi’, in Ucraina, in Terra Santa, in Sudan, nella Repubblica Democratica del Congo, in Myanmar, nel Libano e in tante altre parti del mondo. E nonostante questo noi continuiamo ad augurare: Buona Pasqua. Perché il primo a farlo è stato Lui, il Risorto: ‘Pace a voi’”. Così mons. Douglas Regattieri, vescovo di Cesena-Sarsina, scrive nel suo Messaggio di Pasqua diffuso oggi. Augurare buona Pasqua, per il vescovo, significa “sapere con certezza che chi si offre e si dona a Dio per amore, sicuramente sarà fecondo. Tale fecondità molte volte è invisibile, inafferrabile, non può essere contabilizzata. Uno è ben consapevole che non va perduta nessuna delle sue opere svolte con amore, non va perduta nessuna delle sue sincere preoccupazioni per gli altri, non va perduto nessun atto d’amore per Dio, non va perduta nessuna generosa fatica, non va perduta nessuna dolorosa pazienza”. A volte, continua mons. Regattieri, “ci sembra di non aver ottenuto con i nostri sforzi alcun risultato, ma la missione sfugge ad ogni misura. Noi ci spendiamo con dedizione ma senza pretendere di vedere risultati appariscenti. Sappiamo – conclude – soltanto che il dono di noi stessi è necessario. Impariamo a riposare nella tenerezza delle braccia del Padre in mezzo alla nostra dedizione creativa e generosa”",

Vice President of Sales Ashley Ellis said the Wolf Ranch community is sought after and highly regarded in Georgetown. “It’s really exciting for us to be able to offer a move-up buyer a home in the $400,000s in such an amazing community,” Ellis said. Lifestyle and community-building programs Ellis said PulteGroup is one of seven hand picked builders in the Wolf Ranch neighborhood. The community is known for its award-winning lifestyle program and boasts its own lifestyle director. Wolf Ranch’s reputation for community building has drawn interest in many buyers, from individuals with spouses, to young families. “Wolf Ranch excels at cultivating and fostering close knit communities that appeal to the diverse makeup of the residents. Activities and interest groups are led by both the lifestyle director and by the residents: from family movie nights to happy hour with live music and food trucks to book clubs and run groups, there is truly something for everyone.\" PulteGroup homesites In addition to a diverse community, buyers will also find diverse floor plans, each offering something different for clients. Ellis said PulteGroup offers plans from 1,800 square feet up to 2,700 square feet. One of the most notable floor plans is PulteGroup’s newest model, the Amherst, only available in Wolf Ranch. “One of the most exciting things about our Amherst plan is it has beautiful vaulted ceilings,” Ellis said. “It feels very prestigious, just like the community, so I would highly recommend going to see it.” PulteGroup has 42 homesites available that are going quickly. See available [floor plans and models](https://www.pulte.com/homes/texas/austin/georgetown/wolf-ranch-211180?cmp=BPS-_-GO-_-CTX-_-AUS-_-PUL-_-NA-_-ASM-_-NA-_-&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA-P-rBhBEEiwAQEXhH0WJbxaLsM-RDR07nEh0Mjlj4PfyyiMy5b2SFX7xJFuj64mjB6Yu-xoC2Z0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). For buyers who are interested in purchasing a home, Ellis said now is the perfect time to act, especially because interest rates are up, which means home prices are down. The opportunity to move into a brand new home in the $400,000s in this type of community is not something you want to miss. We have a multitude of financing options that help our buyer achieve a monthly payment they can afford today until rates drop and they can refinance. Development and location information Wolf Ranch is still in its development phase, but already has two amenity centers, as well as an onsite elementary school that is within walking distance: [Wolf Ranch Elementary School](https://www.georgetownisd.org/wolfranch). “It feels like you're in an established community, but it still has a lot of life,” Ellis said. “It’s really good for the value of your home, because if people are continuing to build, that value is just going to keep going up.” Georgetown is one of the fastest growing cities in the nation, and prospective clients will have plenty of shopping, dining and entertainment options nearby. Ellis said homeowners get the best of both worlds in the Wolf Ranch community because they have proximity to the interstate while still being tucked away in the hill country. The neighborhood has it all; the beauty of the hill country with resort-style amenities and nature trails and the convenience of being just minutes from Wolf Ranch shopping center and a brand new H-E-B.

    "title": "Bannon to Reporters: No Prison Built Will Ever Shut Me Up | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "By James Morley III | Thursday, 06 June 2024 03:21 PM EDT Following an order by a federal judge to report to prison on July 1, Steven Bannon told reporters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday that \"there is not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up.\" \"I've got great lawyers, we'll go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,\" a fired-up Bannon said during a news conference. Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Carl Nichols, a Donald Trump appointee, ordered Bannon to serve four months in jail after a federal appeals court rejected Bannon's bid to overturn his conviction. Bannon was convicted for defying a congressional subpoena from the House panel investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2020, at the U.S. Capitol. Bannon, who was an adviser in the Trump administration, was convicted in 2022 on a charge of contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents or testify in front of the investigative committee. He wasted little time in his news conference Thursday, going after the Department of Justice and their top officials, starting with Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"I want to say something specific about the Justice Department,\" Bannon said. \"Merrick Garland, [Deputy Attorney General] Lisa Monaco, the entire justice department. They're not gonna shut up Trump, they're not gonna shut up [Peter] Navarro, they're not gonna just up Bannon and they're certainly not gonna shut up MAGA,\" Bannon said emphatically. \"If you look right here you reporters. Two and half to three years we've been here. Look at the rise of MAGA, look at the rise of Donald Trump. If the election was held today, according to [senior data reporter] Harry Enten at CNN, President Trump would win in a landslide.\" Bannon continued saying the entire effort against him is only about stopping the conservative movement. \"All of this, besides the major legal issues that have to be addressed, all of this is about one thing,\" he said. \"This is about shutting down the MAGA movement. Shutting down grassroots conservatives. Shutting down President Trump. Not only are we winning, we are going to prevail. Every number in every poll shows that. There is nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. \"We're gonna win this, we're gonna win at the Supreme Court and more importantly we're gonna win on Nov. 5 in an amazing landslide with the Senate, the House and also Donald J. Trump back as President of the United States.\" © 2024 Newsmax. All rights reserved. Receive breaking news and original analysis - sent right to your inbox.
