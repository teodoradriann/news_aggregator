    "text": "Chhattisgarh government has confirmed that 177 security personnel, including nearly 40 from central forces like CRPF and BSF, died by suicide in the state\nChhattisgarh: Between 2019 and June 15, 2025, 177 security personnel, including 37 from central paramilitary forces, died by suicide in Chhattisgarh, according to a written response presented by Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma in the state Assembly. Sharma, who also holds the Home portfolio, disclosed these figures in reply to a question raised by senior BJP MLA Ajay Chandrakar.\nOf the total suicides, 26 were from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), five from the Border Security Force (BSF), three from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and one each from the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), and Tripura State Rifles. The remaining cases involved personnel from various branches of the state police such as the Chhattisgarh Armed Force, Special Task Force, and Home Guard.\nThe yearly breakdown of suicides is as follows: 25 in 2019, 38 in 2020, 24 in 2021, 31 in 2022, 22 in 2023, 29 in 2024, and eight in the first half of 2025.\nInvestigations revealed causes ranging from personal and family issues to alcoholism, health problems, and impulse-related aggression. Additionally, 18 security personnel were found to be involved in murder cases during the same period, including incidents of fratricide where colleagues were killed in internal disputes.\nIn response, the state government has implemented multiple welfare initiatives aimed at addressing mental health and morale among forces. These include counselling by psychiatrists, yoga and cultural programmes, regular leave policies, de-addiction drives, and grievance redressal systems. The DGP reportedly holds grievance hearings twice a week at Police Headquarters.\n(With ANI inputs)\nRelated Topics\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

    "text": "By: Laura Meyers\nMike Rowe made a Facebook post about his encounter with the youngest, savviest, cutest, most debonaire entrepreneur ever.\nIt was a negotiation from the start. Alexander wanted to sell me a cup of fresh-squeezed lemonade for $1. I wanted to pay 50 cents. So we haggled.\nI argued the key ingredient – water – was free. Alexander reminded me there was a drought in California.\nI pointed out that a glass of cool lemonade served on a chilly, overcast day like today, was less valuable than it might be on a day that was hot and sunny. Alexander pointed out the importance of staying hydrated in all temperatures.\nI said a glass of lemonade served just around the corner could be purchased for the same $1, but included unlimited refills.\nHe said that theirs was a “crappy national brand,” filled with extra sugar and “perfect for anyone who wanted rotten teeth,” whereas his was “fresh- squeezed from lemons grown in his mothers backyard, with a sufficient but modest amount of sugar added.”\nHe went on to discuss the cost of cups, marketing, signage, and of course, payroll. He then suggested my purchase would help support a small business, and that my patronage would forge a relationship with the owner and sole proprietor of a nascent but growing concern.\nIn the end, we settled on $2, which included the lemonade, a strawberry, and permission to post this photo.\nAssuming he can get out from under his student loans, I think Alexander will do just fine…\nMike\nThis kid is as cool as his fedora. Wait… did he have a permit for his lemonade stand?!",
