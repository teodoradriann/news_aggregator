    "text": "Atmospheric conditions mean the aurora was visible on Thursday Gloucestershire Live readers have sent in their beautiful pictures of the northern lights as the aurora was visible in the county's skies on Thursday night (October 10). The Met Office issued a warning saying the phenomenon might be visible and how right they were despite it being usually more visible in the north of the UK. The south of the country has seen its fair share and according to the Met Office website: \"The northern lights (also known as aurora borealis) appear as large areas of colour including pale green, pink, shades of red, yellow, blue and violet in the direction due north. \"The northern lights are best seen in darkness, away from any light pollution. The lights generally extend from 50 miles to as high as 400 miles above the Earth's surface. The northern lights occur as a consequence of solar activity and result from collisions of charged particles in the solar wind colliding with molecules in the Earth's upper atmosphere.\" Zoe Dykes from Alderton near Tewkesbury captured some amazing images of the northern lights, describing the view as \"humbling and exhilarating.\" \"It feels like watching the sky come alive with a dance of colours, Zoe said. \"There’s a quiet awe that settles over you, almost like time stops for a moment as the lights ripple above and it's a humbling and exhilarating reminder of how incredible our world is.\" Jo Findlay from Tetbury, who was lucky enough to witness the aurora borealis earlier in May too, said \"it feels amazing\" seeing them again.

    "text": "16th February 2024/ Cambridge, UK: Handbags made of mushroom leather and biodegradable foodware are two examples of how white biotechnology can produce functional products that look good. With the right input feedstock, such as biomass or gases, and the right fermentation processes, the outputs of white biotechnology processes can be utilized in textiles, chemicals, and fuels. Using CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the fermentation process can also contribute to the growing circular bioeconomy. Green fashion forward Large mats made from the mycelium roots of mushrooms are a versatile material used for leather-alternative clothes and accessories. This is thanks to mycelium having a similar durability to that of traditional leather once treated with a tanning agent. As mycelium leather is a tough material and treated with preservatives for long-term usage, consumers won’t have to worry about their handbags degrading. Microbial leather, derived from the fermentation of bacteria or yeast, may also possess similar sustainable yet functional qualities. These microorganisms produce collagen or cellulose, among other molecules, which form the structure of the leather alternative material. The resulting fermentation-based materials are processed so that they become convincingly leather-like in appearance, so donning a pair of smart trainers doesn’t have to scream mushroom. CO2 utilization Certain classes of microbes, such as acetogens and knallgas, can use CO2 as a fermentation input alongside hydrogen. Such CO2 utilization offers an opportunity to valorize captured CO2 while creating valuable products such as fuels and drop-in chemicals, providing an economic incentive to decarbonize. Microbes can often handle impurities, allowing minimal flue gas processing when compared to most other CO2 utilization pathways (such as thermochemical or electrochemical production of CO2-derived e-fuels). Emerging trends in this area involve using steel mill smelter gas because it is rich in CO, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. By using a readily available waste material (CO2), an environmental detriment can be transformed into a positive using biotechnology. Fossil plastic-free packaging and picnics Sustainable packaging is a market benefitting from white biotechnology, as with the right combination of inputs, biocatalysts, and process parameters, biobased materials can be designed and produced to replace fossil-based plastics. The impact of biodegradable bioplastics made through white biotechnology could reduce plastic waste in oceans and in landfills, thus contributing to the success of the circular economy. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a common bioplastic used in the production of compostable plates and foodware. The versatility of this material allows it to be produced in different shapes and sizes; for consumers looking to use products that are biodegradable, PLA foodware is a strong option so that their birthday parties and beach picnics don’t have to generate harmful waste. White biotechnology is a technology enabler for sustainable materials, such as animal leather and fossil plastic alternatives that can attract consumers with the benefits of switching to biobased materials without necessarily giving up quality. White biotechnology can also offer purpose to the gases accumulated by carbon capture, as scientists can put them to good use in making useable and eco-friendly chemicals and materials. While there is still significant work to be done to widen the application of biobased materials in industries like packaging and fashion, the growth of biobased materials will enable people to make more sustainable choices while shopping, thus helping the planet and strengthening the bioeconomy.",

    "text": "(TMX) -- Cher has filed for conservatorship of her son Elijah Blue Allman’s estate due to alleged substance abuse problems.\nThe 77-year-old music icon is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, according to documents filed in Los Angeles. Cher claims Allman, 47, is “currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.”\nThe filing says a conservator is “urgently needed” because he is due to receive a payout from his trust before the end of the year.\n“Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues, [Cher] is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk,” the filing states.\nAllman is Cher’s youngest child, and his father is the late musician Gregg Allman.\nAccording to the filing, Allman’s estranged wife, Marieangela King, is unfit to be conservator as “their tumultuous relationship has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises.”\nEarlier this year, Cher was accused of kidnapping after reports surfaced that she allegedly hired four men to retrieve Allman from a New York hotel in November 2022 as part of an intervention. King, 36, alleged Cher hired the men to stop him from reconciling with her and save their marriage.\nCher denied the reports.\nAccording to the conservatorship filing, Cher “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.”\nCopyright 2023 TMX.

    "title": "Michigan Mom Triumphs in Surrogacy Law Reform, Aiding Families Statewide",
    "text": "In a landmark move that signifies a potential turning point for families across Michigan, Tammy Myers has become a beacon of hope and change. After enduring the emotionally taxing process of having to legally adopt her own biological twins due to Michigan's stringent surrogacy laws, Myers has tirelessly worked towards legislative reform. Today, her efforts are on the brink of fruition as the Michigan Family Protection Act , which seeks to repeal the state's criminal ban on surrogacy, is poised for a final vote in the Senate.\nAdvertisment The Struggle for Legal Recognition Tammy Myers' journey began in the wake of a challenging breast cancer diagnosis, which cast uncertainty over her future family plans. Despite these obstacles, Myers and her husband, Jordan, welcomed twins via a gestational carrier in 2021. However, Michigan's laws forced them into a legal battle to adopt their biological children, highlighting the state's outdated approach to surrogacy. This experience spurred Myers into action, leading to a three-year campaign for change. Her story gained momentum, capturing the attention of lawmakers and the public alike, underscoring the urgent need for legal reform to protect families formed through assisted reproductive technologies.\nA Legislative Leap Forward Advertisment The Michigan Family Protection Act represents a significant step towards legal clarity and security for families like the Myers. Sponsored by Representative Samantha Steckloff and supported by figures such as Congresswoman Hillary Scholten and Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the bill aims to modernize Michigan's surrogacy laws. By eliminating the criminal penalties associated with surrogacy contracts, the legislation seeks to ensure that all children born through fertility treatments have a secure legal relationship with their parents from the start. This move not only benefits families but also aligns Michigan's legal framework with contemporary family-building practices.\nImplications for Future Families The potential passing of the Michigan Family Protection Act holds profound implications for countless families within the state. By fostering a more inclusive and supportive legal environment, the act promises to alleviate the emotional and financial burdens faced by those relying on surrogacy and other assisted reproductive technologies. For Myers, the fight transcends her own family's ordeal, symbolizing a broader struggle for recognition and rights within the realm of reproductive justice. As the Senate vote approaches, anticipation builds, with many hoping that Michigan will set a precedent for compassion and progress in surrogacy law reform.\nAs Tammy Myers reflects on her journey, her resolve remains unwavering. The impending Senate vote not only signifies a personal victory but also marks a pivotal moment for reproductive rights and family law in Michigan. With the potential repeal of the state's criminal ban on surrogacy, Myers' advocacy could pave the way for a future where families are no longer subjected to unnecessary legal hurdles in their pursuit of happiness. This legislative milestone underscores the power of individual stories to inspire systemic change, offering hope to families across Michigan and beyond.",

The S&P 500 averages about a 10% gain every year.\nWhile investing was once reserved for adults, it’s now accessible to kids under their parent’s supervision.\nElsa doesn’t complain about doing chores as she knows each completed task will earn her a little money from her parents.\nBut instead of running out the door to spend her cash, Elsa has bigger goals in mind.\n“Make sure you save your money instead of just spending it all the time,” she explained to FOX 13 News.\nThe fourth grader saves her money in an app called “Busy Kid.” She did so well with her savings this year that the developers honored her with their “Best of the Best” award for 2023.\n“In a world where finances are in a mess this is exactly what we are trying to do,” explained Gregg Murset, CEO of Busy Kid. “Change the next generation in how they think about this stuff.”\nMurset said the app allows kids to invest their money and use their very own debit card to make purchases with parental approval.\nHe believes that children as young as 5 years old, kindergartners, can learn smart financial habits.\n“If they can learn it early in life, it changes how they think about money, how they deal with their own money and it sets them up for success in the future,” Murset said.\nElsa’s parents have the same mindset, encouraging their daughter to categorize her money into savings, spending and charitable contributions.\n“I hope these principles set in and they stick she can take these her whole life,” reflected Matt Dees, Elsa’s father. “It gives her this great foundation of financial achievements we want to instill in our kids.\nElsa is saving up with her sights set on a trip to Harry Potter’s Wizarding World in Florida.\n“I have been trying to save everything,” she explained. “It’s easy to save money because then you’ll have more money that you can get other things that you want instead of just spending it really fast.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "title": "Congresso vai entrar com recurso para suspender decisão de Dino sobre emendas",
    "text": "A Câmara dos Deputados, o Senado Federal e os presidentes de partidos entrarão nesta quinta-feira, 15, com um recurso pedindo para suspender a liminar apresentada ontem pelo ministro Flávio Dino, do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), que interrompe a execução de todas as emendas impositivas. De acordo com fontes ouvidas pela reportagem, o Congresso estuda ainda uma medida para melhor disciplinar o uso das emendas, privilegiando especialmente as de pagamento obrigatório e que asseguram o cumprimento dos pisos mínimos constitucionais da Saúde e Educação. A proposta das lideranças é de construir uma saída que contemple Parlamento e governo e que atenda às exigências do Judiciário. Como antecipou ontem o Estadão/Broadcast, o presidente da Câmara, Arthur Lira (PP-AL), sinalizou que conversaria com o presidente do Senado, Rodrigo Pacheco (PSD-MG), para tratar da decisão de Dino. Em reunião na noite desta quarta-feira, 14, Lira e líderes partidários falaram em recorrer à Corte para tentar derrubar a determinação do magistrado, mas buscavam o apoio de Pacheco. Dino suspendeu todas as emendas impositivas Dino suspendeu nesta quarta todas as emendas impositivas de parlamentares ao Orçamento da União até que o Legislativo crie regras para a execução desses recursos que observem requisitos de transparência, rastreabilidade e eficiência. Deputados e senadores chegaram a prever para esta quarta a votação de mudanças nas chamadas emendas Pix para dar mais transparência nos repasses. A análise ocorreria na Comissão Mista de Orçamento (CMO), mas o item foi retirado de pauta para a inclusão da medida provisória do Judiciário que acabou sendo rejeitada. O Congresso foi pego de surpresa, e agora os parlamentares querem se debruçar sobre a nova decisão de Dino para avaliar os desdobramentos. Até então, o ministro havia suspendido apenas a operação das emendas Pix, que são uma parte das emendas individuais. A nova decisão, contudo, afeta todas as individuais e também as emendas de bancada estadual. Dino já havia pedido mais transparência nas emendas de comissão, que não são impositivas. A ideia é delimitar o objeto das emendas Pix, ou seja, explicitar para qual fim o dinheiro está sendo usado (para qual obra ou política pública específica). Hoje, não fica claro como as prefeituras estão usando as verbas, embora o nome do deputado que enviou a emenda possa ser identificado. Emendas parlamentares são recursos no Orçamento da União que podem ser direcionados pelos deputados e senadores a seus redutos eleitorais. Hoje, existem três modalidades: as emendas individuais, a que cada deputado e senador tem direito, as de bancada estadual e as de comissão. As duas primeiras são impositivas, ou seja, o pagamento é obrigatório, embora o governo controle o ritmo da liberação. As emendas Pix (batizadas com esse nome em referência ao sistema de pagamento instantâneo criado pelo Banco Central) são uma forma de manejar as emendas individuais e permitem a destinação direta de recursos federais a Estados e municípios sem controle e fiscalização. Apesar de estarem empenhados em resolver os problemas de transparência das emendas Pix para atender aos questionamentos do Judiciário, os líderes da Câmara estão mais preocupados com o impacto nas emendas de comissão, que também foram incluídas na ação relatada por Dino no STF. As emendas de comissão têm sido usadas como moeda de troca política no Congresso desde o fim do orçamento secreto, esquema revelado pelo Estadão que consistia no repasse de emendas de relator sem transparência e de forma que dificultava a fiscalização. A ofensiva sobre esses recursos, portanto, impacta diretamente no poder da cúpula do Legislativo, às vésperas das eleições para as presidências da Câmara e do Senado. O pano de fundo do imbróglio é uma disputa de poder entre o Executivo e Legislativo, arbitrada pelo Judiciário. O orçamento secreto foi declarado inconstitucional pelo STF após a eleição do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, mas parte dos recursos continuou nas mãos do Congresso, após um acordo feito com o Planalto. Agora, os parlamentares veem nova ofensiva do governo federal, em aliança com o Judiciário, para retomar mais poder sobre o Orçamento. Principalmente porque Dino foi indicado por Lula para a Corte.",
