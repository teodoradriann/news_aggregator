    "title": "Jai Opetaia calls out Chris Billam-Smith for ducking, offers $250,000 to get fight made - The Ring",
    "text": "Ring Magazine and IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia (25-0, 19 KOs) has offered a scathing assessment of why a unification bout against WBO titleholder Chris Billam-Smith has not come to fruition. The 29-year-old Australian southpaw has made it clear he wants all the belts ever since he overcame a double fracture to his jaw to dethrone Ring champion Mairis Briedis (28-3, 20 KOs) via unanimous decision two years ago. England’s Billam-Smith, 33, won the WBO strap with a majority decision victory over Lawrence Okolie (20-1, 15 KOs) in an ugly fight in May last year. He has since spoken of his own desire for unification bouts, including against Opetaia as recently as early June, but latest reports have linked him to a bout against WBA titleholder Gilberto “Zurdo” Ramirez (46-1, 30 KOs). It has left Opetaia in a frustrating position as he continues to look for a suitable dance partner who can bring out his greatness. Opetaia didn’t sound hopeful when he was interviewed at ringside on Thursday night during DAZN’s coverage of the Justis Huni versus Troy Pilcher fight in Brisbane about the potential of a Billam-Smith bout. He even offered up $250,000 of his own money to Billam-Smith to get the fight made. “I’m ready for that fight,” Opetaia said. “They’ve been going over saying they’re waiting for negotiations and shit. It’s fucking bullshit. He don’t want that fight. “It’s easy done. He’d get the biggest paycheck he’s ever had. He’ll be on the biggest stage he’s ever been on. It’s a no-brainer to take, but the only reason they wouldn’t take it is if they’re ducking. “The offer’s there, we’ve made the offer. If he’s not taking it, he’s ducking the fight.” Opetaia’s manager, Mick Francis, is equally bemused by Billam-Smith’s apparent reluctance to face his fighter. “Jai wants to get this fight made more than anything else,” said Francis. “But we’ve heard nothing but crickets since the offer went through. It seems like Billam-Smith might be looking to go to America to fight instead. Ben Shalom’s boxers have a history of ducking Jai, so we’re not surprised. “Jai wants to fight the best there is and Chris is making excuses about wanting to box in America instead. This narrative started in the post-fight interview after he beat Richard Riakporhe and it hasn’t stopped.” Days out from his title defense against Riakporhe (17-1, 13 KOs) early last month, Billam-Smith made all the right noises when asked about an Opetaia matchup, but with one caveat – the Aussie would need to pick up more hardware first. “I think it’s the biggest fight in the division at the moment,” Billam-Smith told Sky Sports. “It would be great to get that fight done. It would be amazing if we could do it for an undisputed world title, for all four of the belts. “I think that’s the big one. I’ve got a job to do, but down the line, definitely, it’s a huge fight and the biggest fight in the division. “He ticks a lot of boxes; he’s got good footwork, really good timing, good speed, good shot selection there. He’s super tough as well, obviously – you’ve seen him fight with a broken jaw. “He’s a really, really talented fighter and, like I said, ticks a lot of boxes. So it would be great if we could fight down the line.” Opetaia is itching to get back in the ring following his second points win over Latvian veteran Briedis in Saudi Arabia in May. Speaking immediately after the fight, Opetaia made it clear who he wanted his next opponent to be. “I want the WBO next,” he said. “I want the winner of Chris Billam-Smith and [Richard Riakporhe], and after that we’re gonna collect the rest.” As of right now, that bout is unlikely to happen any time soon.

    "text": "Disrupt.com, a UAE-based venture builder founded by three Pakistanis, Aaqib Gadit, Uzair Gadit, and Umair Gadit, has announced a $100 million investment commitment to support technology ventures worldwide.\nThe ambitious move underscores the firm’s focus on fostering innovation in technology-driven sectors like AI, cybersecurity, Web 3.0, automotive technology, and retail innovation. The investment also positions Disrupt.com as a key player in the emerging global technology ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on underserved markets such as MENA and Pakistan.\nAmid a global venture capital slowdown, with MENA VC investments falling 29% in 2024, Disrupt.com’s approach aims to counter the trend, providing funding, strategic guidance, and operational support to early-stage startups. The firm is determined to empower entrepreneurs in regions that typically face challenges in accessing growth capital, especially in the wake of funding declines in places like the UAE, where investments decreased by 8%.\nDisrupt.com’s founders, originally from Pakistan, have a deep-rooted entrepreneurial background. They first made their mark in the technology space through Gaditek, which they founded in Karachi in 2008. In 2022, they sold Cloudways, a Malta-based cloud hosting platform, to US-listed Digital Ocean Holdings for $350 million, marking one of the biggest exits in Pakistan.\nCloudways’ acquisition by DigitalOcean marked a significant milestone for the Gadit family, and also allowed them to reinvest their capital and experience into their next venture: Disrupt.com. Since its inception, Disrupt.com has already deployed over $40 million into a diverse range of startups in key technology sectors, including cybersecurity, AI, and Web 3.0, according to the company.\nAaqib Gadit, co-founder and CEO of Disrupt.com, reflected on the success of Cloudways, noting, “SMBs love simplicity, performance, predictability, affordability, and great support. Together with DigitalOcean, we turbocharged Cloudways’ mission of helping SMBs grow through cloud offerings. Now, with Disrupt.com, we aim to support a broader range of entrepreneurs and tech ventures globally.”\nThe $100 million commitment from Disrupt.com will target early-stage startups that focus on AI, cybersecurity, Web 3.0, automotive technology, and retail innovation. The firm is particularly interested in businesses at the pre-seed to Series A stage that show strong organic growth potential and clear paths to profitability. This aligns with the company’s mission to help create sustainable businesses that will drive the next wave of innovation in these industries.\n“We are doubling down on building the next wave of startups that will define the future of the world,” said Aaqib Gadit. “Web 3.0 is in its early stages, and AI is revolutionizing industries. The opportunity to solve real-world problems and create businesses that align with how people live and work is vast, and we believe MENA and Pakistan will play an integral role in this transformation.”\nDisrupt.com is not only committed to providing funding but also to fostering a supportive ecosystem that helps startups thrive. With a network of over 650 professionals globally, including many in Pakistan, the firm offers entrepreneurs access to a wealth of expertise across business strategy, technology development, and marketing.\nBy leveraging experience and the lessons learned from previous ventures, Disrupt.com founders aim to create a powerful ecosystem for founders. “Our network brings the experience of all the mistakes we’ve made ourselves in the past,” added Uzair Gadit, co-founder of Disrupt.com. “We are here to help entrepreneurs avoid these pitfalls and accelerate their growth.”\nDespite relocating its headquarters to Dubai, Disrupt.com maintains strong ties with Pakistan and other underserved markets. The founders’ commitment to empowering entrepreneurs in these regions is integral to the firm’s mission. Aaqib Gadit emphasized the firm’s belief in the untapped potential of MENA and Pakistan, stating, “There are incredible entrepreneurs in this region, but they often lack the resources to bring their ideas to life. We are here to bridge that gap and help them build world-class businesses.”\nThis focus on MENA and Pakistan comes at a critical time when venture capital funding in the region is declining. According to data from Magnitt, MENA VC investments dropped by 29% in 2024, and early-stage investments in the UAE decreased by 8%. Disrupt.com’s commitment to these regions provides a vital lifeline for entrepreneurs who otherwise might not have access to the necessary funding and support to scale their businesses.",

    "title": "Who owns the streets of Kigali? Embracing non-motorized modes of transport",
    "text": "This newspaper published an interesting article titled “Slowly but surely, Kigali city is reclaiming streets for people” on November 3, 2023. The author informed us that Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda, has about 893 kilometres of streets and roads, while reminding us what we already know: that these roadways have primarily served the singular purpose of facilitating vehicular transportation from one location to another. The nouveau concepts of car free zones and car free days makes us think otherwise, making the discussion on the dynamic relationship between people and cars, and how we could and should better co-exist on streets an interesting one. Vehicular presence tends to intimidate pedestrians and cyclists. Accurately or not, pedestrians and bicyclists judge injury risk and respond accordingly. For this reason, be it real or perceived, this danger and discomfort imposed by vehicles discourages walking and bicycling. It is perhaps worth reflecting on how we actually used streets during the Covid-19 pandemic, and probably how our perceptions and practices on use of streets have changed in the post-Covid era. The experience of staying at home for months, that most of us were experiencing for the first time, and that most of us dreaded initially but eventually got so used to; the period where cars were largely parked at home or work place, and we walked more or cycled when we could, to get out of the boredom of staying home or as other would say to “change weather”. It was evident that in some areas, this saw the neighbourhood streets getting more and more vibrant with sports, to an extent that it was hard to believe cars were ever coming back again. Understandably, the temporal change of use from transportation to recreation was a movement sweeping across many cities globally. With this reflection, the good thing about discussing who owns streets in the sense of who is using streets more, is that it goes beyond streets being a piece of infrastructure to move us from one place to another, but how their use has the possibility to greatly influence our own health and wellbeing positively, through increased physical activity. Globally, the health consequences of physical inactivity are increasingly becoming more apparent. In Rwanda, there are significant efforts in fighting non-communicable diseases and related conditions, such as overweight and obesity. One of the interventions have been promoting sports, addition of sports infrastructure and mass sports especially on car free days and night runs that most of us have had the opportunity to be part of. Running, jogging, walking, all for a better health. Obviously, although bicycling and walking are major potential contributors to good health, everyone; you and I, would be rightfully scared to do this on the streets! At least until extra measures are taken to ensure safety for all. Kigali’s inspiration to other cities, through pedestrian corridors. Kigali is celebrated globally, for key interventions such as car free zones and car free days. Inspired by Kigali, many other cities in the region are increasingly experimenting with temporary and permanent car bans on their streets. The most interesting part of the Kigali story is the main rational behind closing streets, to allow people to do sports. To run, to jog, to walk, to play, to dance, to do yoga, to meet friends and laugh, to find happiness. Increasingly, we have also been able to bring our children and pets too, to the streets, and they are also having fun. I hope you will all agree with me that these are communal and social cohesion benefits that no one minds. The free health checks at the end of the 3-hour block on every the first and third Sunday of the month, is another significant catalyst to healthy living. To environmental gains, a recent study has showed that during car-free days Kigali has witnessed a 15% reduction in air pollution. This is mainly due to the stretch of closed road being 10-kilometers long and like so for a duration of 3 hours alone. Therefore while we do sports, get healthier, nature is happy with us too. The benefits mentioned above complete the triangle of sustainability; socially, economically and environmentally. This is why we need to support giving the streets back to the people, for walking and cycling more than for driving, for as much as possibilities allow. How then, can we rethink our transport means, and use cars less and less while giving more ownership and use of streets to pedestrians and cyclists? It is true that we take cars for unnecessary trips. Some short trips can be done by walking. For medium and long trips, especially school runs (dropping and picking kids to/from school) and commuting to office, carpooling can limit the number of cars on our streets. Taking a public bus is better than driving personal cars, as it takes over 20 cars to transport the same number of passengers a bus does. What is missing in buses that we get on our personal cars and how can we get added to them? We are not stuck in traffic, we are traffic. Rapid motorization in Rwanda (and other developing countries) is the reason why our streets are clogging in the mornings and evenings. The increase in number of vehicles on streets, is accompanied by an even faster decline in bicycle riding, and further lowering real or perceived pedestrian safety, etc. The call to action starts with little steps. First, instead of saying/feeling that we are stuck in traffic, it would be better to say/feel that we are the traffic. Secondly, always bearing in mind that motorised traffic discourages non-motorized traffic and hence the related physical activity, it makes walking and bicycling unpleasant. Let us embrace interventions that reduce the danger of drivers, motorist, riders to people walking and bicycling on the street. The street belongs more to people too.

Ensuring that your website's user interface (UI) is optimized is paramount to creating a positive user experience, fostering engagement, and ultimately driving conversions. In this article, we'll explore ten practical tips to help you optimize the UI of your website and leave a lasting impression on your visitors.\n1. Streamline Navigation and Menu Structure:\nUser-friendly navigation is the backbone of a well-optimized UI. Your website's menu structure should be clear, intuitive, and organized logically to help users find the information they seek effortlessly. Start by conducting a thorough analysis of your website's content hierarchy. Ensure that important pages or sections are easily accessible from the main navigation menu. Consider using dropdown menus to categorize related content and maintain a clean, clutter-free layout. Regularly review and refine your menu structure as your website evolves to keep it user-centric.\n2. Use High-Quality Photos for Visual Appeal:\nWhen users land on your website, the first thing that catches their eye is visual content. High-quality images not only capture attention but also convey professionalism and credibility. They can set the tone for your brand and influence the overall perception of your website.\nTo enhance the visual appeal of your website, consider resources that offer free stock photos for commercial us . These resources provide access to a wide range of high-resolution images that can complement your content and design. When selecting images, ensure they are relevant to your brand and message, and optimize them for web use to avoid slowing down page loading times.\n3. Prioritize Mobile Responsiveness:\nThe rise of mobile device usage necessitates responsive web design. Mobile responsiveness ensures that your website functions seamlessly on smartphones and tablets, providing a consistent user experience across all devices.\nPrioritize mobile responsiveness by adopting a mobile-first approach to design. Test your website on various devices and screen sizes to identify any issues, such as text or images not displaying correctly. Consider using responsive design frameworks and tools to streamline the development process and optimize your website for mobile users.\n4. Optimize Page Loading Speed:\nIn the fast-paced digital environment we live today, users often have little patience to wait for slow-loading websites. A slow website can have high bounce rates and could be a reason behind lost opportunities. The page loading speed may affect the user experience and can have an adverse impact on your search engine rankings as well.\nTo optimize page loading speed, start by compressing images and other media files without compromising quality. Minify your website's code to reduce unnecessary elements and scripts. Consider using content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute content efficiently. Regularly monitor your website's performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to identify and address speed-related issues promptly.\n5. Enhance Readability and Typography:\nThe readability of your website's content is essential for retaining user engagement. Typography plays a significant role in ensuring that your text is easy to read and visually appealing.\nBegin by selecting legible fonts for both headings and body text. Aim for a font size that's comfortable for reading on various devices, and ensure adequate line spacing for readability. Pay attention to the contrast between text and background colors to make content stand out. Consistency in typography across your website contributes to a polished and user-friendly design.\n6. Implement Clear Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons:\nClear and compelling calls-to-action (CTAs) are essential for guiding users toward desired actions on your website, whether it's making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or contacting your business.\nBegin by strategically placing CTAs throughout your website, ensuring they stand out from surrounding content. Use action-oriented language that prompts users to take immediate action, such as \"Buy Now,\" \"Subscribe,\" or \"Get Started.\" Make sure that the color and design of your CTA buttons contrast with the rest of your page, making them easily identifiable. It's always better to test different CTA variations, which can help you determine which the best ones that resonate with your audience. Tools like A/B testing can provide insights into the most effective CTA elements, allowing you to continually refine your approach for better user engagement.\n7. Maintain Consistency in Design Elements:\nConsistency in design is critical for creating a cohesive and user-friendly experience on your website. When users encounter uniformity in colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design elements, they are more likely to feel comfortable and navigate your site with ease.\nStart by establishing a style guide that outlines your brand's design principles, including color palettes, typography, and imagery guidelines. Enforce these guidelines across all pages and sections of your website. Consistency should extend to header and footer design, navigation menus, and button styles.\n8. Opt for User-Friendly Forms:\nForms are an integral part of websites, whether they're used for contact inquiries, lead generation, or e-commerce transactions. Designing user-friendly forms is essential to prevent user frustration and increase form completion rates.\nBegin by minimizing the number of required form fields to reduce user effort. Provide clear and concise instructions for each field and utilize placeholders or labels to guide users. Ensure that form validation is instant and provides meaningful error messages when necessary.\n9. Include Interactive Elements:\nInteractive elements, such as animations, sliders, accordions, and hover effects, can enhance user engagement and make your website more dynamic and engaging incorporate interactive elements to showcase product features, highlight key content, or provide additional information without overwhelming the user. Ensure that interactive elements enhance the user experience rather than distract from it. Pay attention to load times, as heavy animations or scripts can slow down your website.\n10. Conduct Usability Testing and Gather Feedback:\nThe final step in optimizing your website's user interface is to conduct usability testing and actively seek feedback from your users testing involves observing how real users interact with your website and identifying pain points, areas of confusion, or elements that may hinder the user experience. Usability testing can provide invaluable insights into the effectiveness of your design and user interface.\nConclusion\nOptimizing the user interface of your website is a multifaceted process that involves careful attention to design, usability, and user feedback. Remember that website optimization is an ongoing effort. Regularly monitor user behavior, conduct usability testing, and gather feedback to identify areas for improvement. By implementing these ten tips, you can create a website that not only looks visually appealing but also offers a seamless and user-friendly experience to visitors.\nMENAFN28122023003198003206ID1107666580\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

A power-packed show from Kim Mulkey’s starting five saw them secure a tough 84-73 victory. Apparently, all these five players ended the night with a double-digit score. America’s Favorite Video Today A cracker of a game awaited the NCAA fans Sunday night as the Ole Miss Rebels hosted the defending champions LSU. As both teams entered the contest following their impressive victories in their respective SEC openers, it was LSU who came out on top with a victory in the end. Angel Reese spearheads LSU’s second SEC win LSU began the game by putting the first points onto the scoreboard. Mikaylah Williams carried her form from the last game and set the court on fire with her highlight-reel shots from beyond the arc. Meanwhile, junior guard Aneesah Morrow also joined Williams and displayed her ability to land some astonishing 3-pointers. However, the NCAA champions found themselves trailing after some resistance from senior guard Marquesha Davis. Consequently, she gave the Rebels an upper hand by the end of the first quarter. The Lady Tigers roared back in the second quarter as the All-American forward Angel Reese got the Lady Tigers in front. Moreover, she along with Flau’jae Johnson dominated the perimeter and further extended LSU’s lead. As a result, the first half with the Tigers sitting comfortably at 50-37. Some sloppy play cost LSU in the third quarter as Marquesha Davis punished the lazy LSU defense. She got the Rebels back into the game by bringing down the difference between the two teams to just 4 points. Apparently, Ole was on a (16-2) scoring run which resulted in them leading the Lady Tigers for the second time on the night. However, Williams and Reese combined to score the next 9 points and created some separation. Both of them made sure that the Tigers ended the quarter holding a 5-point advantage. Following this, Reese was at her offensive best in the penultimate quarter. She controlled the game before the final buzzer got the Tigers home and became LSU’s leading scorer for the night.

    "text": "A deadly tragedy unfolded off the coast of Djibouti after smugglers forced dozens of migrants into open waters, leaving at least eight dead and 22 others missing.\nThe group had been packed aboard a vessel carrying 150 people when the smugglers made them disembark and swim to shore on June 5, according to the U.N. migration agency.\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported on Wednesday that its patrol teams discovered survivors stranded in the desert and transported them to a nearby migrant response center. The search for the missing continues in collaboration with Djiboutian authorities.\nREAD ALSO: Deadly floods and snow batter South Africa, leaving seven dead and children missing\n“Every life lost at sea is a tragedy that should never happen,” said Celestine Frantz, IOM Regional Director for the East, Horn and Southern Africa. She condemned the smugglers’ cruelty, saying the victims were “forced into impossible choices by smugglers who show no regard for human life.”\nWatch a recent episode of The BreakDown podcast below and subscribe to our channel PanaGenius TV for latest episodes.\nThe dangerous journey across the Red Sea remains a well-trodden path for migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, many of whom are desperate to reach the Gulf and ultimately Europe. Yemen continues to serve as a major transit hub for those leaving East Africa and the Horn of Africa in pursuit of work opportunities abroad.\nDespite the known dangers, thousands attempt the route each year, often at the mercy of smugglers who exploit their vulnerability.\nREAD ALSO: Ivory Coast confirms cholera outbreak with seven dead as officials warn of rapid spread",
