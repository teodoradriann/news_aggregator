    "text": "CROWNSVILLE, Md. — In life, husband and wife Oren and Bill went above and beyond to bring star trek to earth, Whether it was designing their basement to look like the interior of the starship \"Enterprise,\" or meeting as many members of the cast and crew as they could, or even renewing their wedding vows on a replica of Enterprise with a Klingon as a witness.\nNow, the couple's fandom is extending beyond earth's atmosphere.\n\"When he died, I thought, I want to fulfill his wish of going to space,\" said Oren Whyche-Shaw.\nLieutenant Colonel Bill Shaw always wanted to be an astronaut. He went to the Air Force Academy, but at the time, NASA didn't allow people who needed glasses or contacts to pursue training.\nBut his love for space never faded, and he found an outlet for his passion in adventures with his fellow \"Trekkie\" wife.\nWhen he passed away unexpectedly from an illness in 2017, she decided his passion needed to live on.\n\"We're looking at the orbit of my husband in the first flight - the Heritage flight - and that little satellite is where he is - so I can track him any time day or night,\" Oren explained as she showed us the tracker on her TV.\nHis remains are currently orbiting around the Earth thanks to a company called \"Celestis.\" The company has been offering memorial spaceflights since the 90s.\n\"To me it's just a very natural service for people that are interested in space or science fiction. It's equivalent to scattering ashes at sea, except it's a lot harder. A lot harder,\" said Celestis co-founder Charles Chafer.\nEventually, the satellite carrying his ashes will burn out.\n\"The laws of physics take over, and the spacecraft, including our passengers, burns up in the atmosphere upon reentry in its entirety, making it sort of an 'ashes to ashes' experience.\"\nBut the ever-inventive Oren found a way to make her husband a part of the universe for eternity. She learned Celestis was starting to offer \"forever\" missions, sending satellites into deep space, where they'll orbit endlessly.\n\"And I thought, okay I did the first launch for Bill. But this one, this could be for us.\"\nSo Oren's going with him, where \"no one has gone before\" - at least, a piece of her DNA is.\nAlthough the couple is no longer together Earth-side; in space, they'll literally be together forever.\n\"So he wouldn't be able to get rid of me - ha!\" she joked.\nIt gets better. They'll be joined by the remains of five members of the Star Trek: Enterprise cast and crew, including the creator Gene Rodenberry, Nichelle Nichols, DeForest Kelley, and James “Scotty” Doohan.\nThe rocket, built by the United Launche Alliance, is scheduled to launch on January 8 from Cape Canaveral. It's aptly named the Vulcan rocket, and the mission is called the Enterprise Flight. This will be the first time the company is sending remains into deep space.",

    "text": "DENVER — As thousands of Colorado Catholics celebrate Holy Week, many of them are finding hope in Julia Greeley, a woman whose life story may convince the pope to declare her a saint. “She never knew that she mattered. But she mattered,” said Dr. Barbara Wilcots, who sat on an [Archdiocese of Denver](https://archden.org/julia-greeley/) committee that researched Greeley’s life. In 2016, the archdiocese opened the cause for sainthood and sent about 11,000 pages of documents to the Vatican. The Vatican is currently reviewing the case. Wilcots expressed the importance of Greeley’s potential canonization because she is one of only six Black Americans being considered for sainthood within the Catholic Church. “For that person to have been formerly enslaved, and to be a woman, and to be Black, I think is really important,” Wilcots said. “It really humanizes what it means to be a saint, because as we are Catholic, we are all called to be saints.” Greeley’s story Greeley, who was born into slavery in Missouri and was eventually emancipated, came to Colorado in the 1800s and worked as a housekeeper. In the only photo of her in existence, her right eye appears to be closed. According to her story, a slavemaster’s whip hit Greeley’s eye while she was a baby being held in her mother’s arms. Church records show Greeley became deeply devout to the Catholic Church after she was baptized at Denver’s Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where she was known to pray. Greeley was known to ask for items like food, toys, coal and bedding from the families she would work for and then carry them in a red wagon throughout Denver. She would deliver goods to the needy at night, because many of them were white and didn’t want to be seen getting help from a Black woman. “She did it at the back door at night and tried to do it as secretly as possible,” said Rev. Blaine Burkey, who wrote a biography on Greeley. “She had so many reasons to be bitter,” Burkey said. “She didn't spend her time taking it out on anybody. She spent it helping other people.” “Anytime she heard there were poor people who needed something, she did what she could to try and help them,” Burkey said. One miracle believers attribute to Greeley is the birth of a child to a family who suffered the loss of a child. The woman was told she could no longer have another baby. Greeley, who worked for the family, said a baby would come soon. “And Julia told her, ‘Don’t worry. Pretty soon there will be a little angel running around the house.’ And in fact, not long after that, the woman found out she was going to have a child,” Wilcots said. The child can be seen in the only photo of Greeley that exists. Because of the story of the miracle child, Burkey said he has received notes and letters from people around the world who struggled to have children. The parents said Greeley had given them hope, and some reported conception. “Once her cause was opened, that became worldwide,” Burkey said of Greeley’s growing fame. When Greeley died in 1918, local newspapers reported thousands of people in Denver came to see her body because of her reputation of being devoted to the church and the needy. Soon after the Denver Archdiocese opened a cause for sainthood in 2016, Greeley’s remains were exhumed at Mount Olivet Cemetery and transferred to the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Denver. From 2018: [Julia Greeley's tomb gets a new home](/article/news/local/next/julia-greeleys-tomb-gets-a-new-home/73-560078192) Today, visitors to the basilica can see a large marble sarcophagus with Greely’s name carved into the stone, which also displays the symbol of the Sacred Heart. A forensic anthropologist found Greeley’s bones were riddled with arthritis. Wilcots said it’s likely Greeley experienced discomfort and pain when she walked the streets of Denver at night to help the needy. “She put her own pain and her own personal affliction aside, and just to see that someone has the capacity, it makes your own affliction seem less of a concern,” Wilcots said. The time frame on when the Vatican will make a decision on Greeley’s sainthood is unknown, but historically it can take decades for the pope to canonize someone who is a candidate. Wilcots doesn’t expect the decision to come in her lifetime, but holds hope and admiration for Greeley. “When you think about someone who went about their business living the way we are called to live, caring about people, and sacrificing whatever you have, it makes the possibility of sainthood seem real,” Wilcots said.

    "text": "Kolkata, Aug 2 (PTI) Flight operations to and from the Kazi Nazrul Islam (KNI) airport at Andal in West Bengal’s Paschim Bardhaman district were temporarily suspended on Friday due to water logging in and around its premises, officials said.\n Around three flights, including one from New Delhi and another from Bengaluru, had to be cancelled for the day, they said.\n The district recorded around 192 mm of rainfall overnight.\n The passengers were informed about the problem with ample time in hand to minimise inconvenience caused to them, KNI airport authorities said.\n The first flight was scheduled to land at the airport at 12.50 pm, they said.\n Water gushed into the airport premises and caused water logging in the operational area, an official said. Several places at the approach road to the airport from the highway were also inundated, he said.\n In a statement issued later, Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd (BAPL), the developer of the airport, said due to unprecedented rainfall recorded in and around the Durgapur-Asansol area since Thursday, both KNI airport and the surrounding areas have experienced significant water logging.\n “The situation has been further aggravated owing to a breach of a water reservoir upstream. Due to the flooding at the airport, on account of inclement weather conditions, operations have been temporarily suspended and appropriate authorities informed,” it said.\n The situation is being closely monitored by BAPL, district authorities and local bodies, and steps are being taken for early resumption of airport operations, the statement added.",
