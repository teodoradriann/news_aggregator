    "text": "Éducation Instruction en famille : comment l’encadrement renforcé a fait fondre la pratique\nUn rapport de la Cour des comptes souligne la baisse importante du nombre d’enfants instruits en famille, après le vote, en 2021, de la loi réglementant davantage cette pratique.\nUn serrage de vis qui a eu des effets. Depuis la loi du 24 août 2021 confortant le respect des principes de la République, ne fait plus l’école à la maison qui veut. Les familles qui le souhaitent doivent d’abord demander une autorisation, alors qu’auparavant, elles n’avaient qu’une simple déclaration à faire à la mairie et à l’Éducation nationale. Un encadrement plus strict critiqué par les associations défendant l’instruction en famille (IEF) et qui a eu des répercussions, comme le montre un rapport de la Cour des comptes paru mercredi. La réforme « a permis de davantage sécuriser, dans l’intérêt de l’enfant, le recours à cette modalité d’instruction », soulignent les Sages.\nPour l’année scolaire 2024-2025, première année de mise en œuvre complète du nouveau régime, 30 644 enfants (soit 0,3 % des 3-16 ans) ont été autorisés à être instruits en famille contre 72 369 en 2021-2022 (soit 0,6 %). Certes les demandes ont été moins nombreuses et la baisse démographique se ressent. Mais presque un quart des demandes d’autorisation (23 %) ont été refusées. Car pour obtenir l’aval des autorités, il faut pouvoir justifier sa demande en raison de l’état de santé de l’enfant ou de son\nhandicap, de la pratique d’activités sportives ou artistiques intensives, de l’itinérance de la famille en France, de son éloignement géographique de tout établissement scolaire public ou de l’existence d’une situation propre à l’enfant motivant le projet éducatif. C’est ce dernier motif qui est le plus l’objet du refus d’autorisations. Refus qui génèrent le plus de recours et de saisines de la médiatrice de l’Éducation nationale.\nPar ailleurs, en 2024-2025, 17 refus ont été justifiés par l’inscription des personnes chargées de l’instruction au\nFijait (Fichier des auteurs d’infractions terroristes) ou au Fijaisv (Fichier judiciaire automatisé des auteurs d’infractions sexuelles et violentes).\nDes contrôles à renforcer\nEn général, l’instruction en famille est souvent temporaire. « Pour la majorité des enfants, cela dure un an », souligne la Cour des comptes. Les enfants sont répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire même s’ils sont davantage présents dans le Centre, le Sud-Ouest et le Sud-Est. « Ils sont davantage représentés dans les espaces ruraux à faible densité de population », précisent les Sages.\nAvec la nouvelle loi, les moyens dédiés aux contrôles pédagogiques des familles faisant l’école à la maison ont été améliorés : 80 emplois d’inspecteurs ont ainsi été créés depuis 2022. Si toutes les familles pratiquant l’IEF font théoriquement l’objet d’un contrôle pédagogique annuel et que celui-ci est satisfaisant dans 90 % des cas, la Cour observe cependant que « les contrôles pédagogiques ne sont pas tous effectués ».\nLa réussite scolaire, une inconnue\nAutre point faible : « Le niveau et la réussite scolaire des enfants restent difficiles à mesurer », soulignent les Sages. Il n’existe pas non plus d’indicateurs permettant de renseigner leurs résultats au brevet ou au\nbac. D’où la recommandation de la Cour de rendre obligatoire pour les enfants qui sont instruits dans la famille, le passage des évaluations nationales à la fin de chaque cycle.\nPar ailleurs, si les mairies doivent théoriquement réaliser une enquête auprès des enfants instruits en famille dès la première année puis tous les deux ans, force est de constater que peu le font. La Cour des comptes suggère donc de mieux les informer sur cette mission et de leur fournir une trame type pour réaliser les enquêtes.",

    "title": "Piper Sandler reveals its top 3 biotech stock picks for 2024",
    "text": "Piper Sandler named three biotech stocks as its \"top picks\" for 2024 — citing attractive valuations and pipeline of product launches. The biotech sector has underperformed the S & P 500 index over the past two years, after being in the spotlight at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. But things are looking up: The sector is picking up and is expected to get a boost from interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve next year. \"After another difficult year, there are signs that biotech is recovering into 2024. A pause or even reversal in interest rate hikes is constructive for biotech financing and M & A (mergers & acquisitions) remains active,\" Piper Sandler's analysts Edward Tenthoff and Thad Barney wrote in a Dec. 22 note to investors. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Piper Sandler's analysts like Arrowhead , reiterating their overweight rating for the stock. They cited the company's plan to release phase 3 trial data for plozasiran for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome in mid-2024, and phase 3 trials for its use in severe hypertriglyceridemia, among other developments. It is also looking to do a cardiovascular outcome trial on either plozasiran or zodasiran to assess their impact on mortality and non-fatal strokes. Plozasiran and zodasiran are therapies targeting specific genes involved in the oxidation of fatty acids for energy production and other needs of the body. Data from analytics company GlobalData , shows that sales of plozasiran and zodasiran will hit $651 million by 2030, and $399 million by 2029 respectively. ARWR YTD mountain Year-to-date share price of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Year-to-date shares in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals were down nearly 20% to $31.03 on Dec. 27. Piper Sandler expects the company's trial pipeline to raise its stock price by 90% over the next 12 months to $59 a share. Legend Biotech Legend Biotech is another one of Piper Sandler's top picks. The investment bank said the pharmaceutical company's Carvykti drug — which is used to treat adults with bone marrow cancer — is \"the best in class,\" with \"demand far outpacing supply.\" Legend Biotech developed and commercialized the Carvykti drug with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Biotech. Piper Sandler expects Carvykti revenue to jump from $506 million in 2023 to $1.05 billion in 2024, and notes that Legend and Janssen are planning to increase global supply to 10,000 doses annually by the end of 2025. Peak revenue could exceed $5 billion, supported by the rise in production levels, according to the analysts. Aside from Carvykti, Legend is \"developing a rich pipeline\" of CAR-T Cell therapies for the treatment of different cancers, the analysts wrote. In line with this, the company announced a license agreement with Novartis last month to develop and commercialize cell therapies. LEGN YTD mountain Year-to-date shares in Legend Biotech Year-to-date shares in Legend Biotech were trading 20.5% up at $58.70. Piper Sandler expects shares to rise 53.3% to $90 over the next 12 months. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam also made Piper Sandler's list of top picks, given the potential of its phase 3 trials on Amvuttra — a drug used in the treatment of polyneuropathy, a condition that involves the simultaneous malfunction of nerves. Piper Sandler expects Amvuttra sales to jump from $550 million in 2023 to $1.13 billion in 2025. It also cited Alnylam's plans to make progress on drug trials and studies to treat patients with severe hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. ALNY YTD mountain Year-to-date shares in Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Shares in Alnylam were down nearly 16% year-to-date to $196.57. Piper Sandler expects its share price to reach $217 in the next 12 months, giving it around 10.3% potential upside. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

Perhaps you’ve given yourself a prompt to be a little more authentic?\nFor those picturing cadging a Rizla for a roll-up cig while downing a quick drink in the pub, or giving yourself a nudge to be more you, that’s so yesterday.\nThe endless somersaulting of our language has shifted the meaning of both those sentences dramatically, for today’s ‘rizz’ has left smoking paraphernalia for dust and is embracing instead something we all want a little more of — charisma.\nA Swiftie, meanwhile, is no longer a quick pint down the pub; today’s version is a die-hard member of the vast fandom that exists for singer Taylor Swift.\nA prompt is more likely to be something we give to ChatGPT and ‘authentic’ — being your true self — has suddenly become a pop culture superpower. Say hello to the words of the year for 2023.\nDid 2023 find you looking for some rizz while stopping for a Swiftie? Perhaps you’ve given yourself a prompt to be a little more authentic?\nFor those picturing cadging a Rizla for a roll-up cig while downing a quick drink in the pub, or giving yourself a nudge to be more you, that’s so yesterday\nI have always relished the time when dictionary publishers choose their standout word of the year. They can range from the unexpected (last year’s ‘goblin mode’ springs to mind: a let-it-all-hang-out approach to life) to the serious (‘vax’ in 2021, or ‘credit crunch’ from 2008), with a few light touches in between (‘bovvered’ made it to top spot in 2006 and a meerkatty ‘simples’ in 2009).\nAll this may seem like a silly parlour game for lexicographers, but words can bottle history as well as any picture and each era’s new coinages speak volumes about the preoccupations of those living through it.\nTake the 1920s, a time of linguistic exuberance after the end of World War I which gave us expressions of excellence such as ‘the bee’s knees’ and ‘the cat’s whiskers’ (as well as forgotten gems like ‘the kipper’s knickers’ and ‘the elephant’s adenoids’). This period also saw the emergence of ‘boogie-woogie’, ‘bright young thing’, ‘Charleston’, ‘demob’, ‘hemline’, ‘perm’ and ‘nail varnish’. All put together, you get a vivid collage of the time.\nLeap forward to the 1940s and the picture is clouded once again by war and deprivation. Here we find the first records of ‘blitz’, ‘Molotov cocktail’, ‘Big Brother’, ‘nylons’ (much sought after on the black market) and ‘gulag’.\nLest we think life was all darkness, though, this decade also saw the entrance of the Wonderbra, garden gnome, DNA and the bikini (although this was named after the atomic bomb tests on the Bikini Atoll; the two-piece swimsuit was thought to have a similarly explosive effect.)\n‘Cool’, the adjective of approval that almost any generation can still use today, also came into its own during the jazz era of the 1940s. Towards the end of the 20th century, life and language looked very different.\nWe had ‘bling’, for starters, as well as ‘alcopop’, ‘blog’, ‘Botox’, ‘dotcom’, ‘Google’, ‘home page’, ‘text message’, ‘hotdesking’ and ‘having it large’.\nWhich brings us to this year. If the Oxford Dictionary’s shortlist is anything to go by, dating was uppermost in our minds in 2023, as we continued to re-evaluate our relationships after the make-or-break years of the pandemic.\nOr you may be in a ‘situationship’ — a relationship that is not yet committed. Hopefully it will blossom into something firmer, particularly given enough ‘rizz’ (stock image)\nOf all the words on this year’s shortlist, ‘rizz’ was the one that really captured the imagination. A shortening of ‘charisma’, it describes that certain charm or je ne sais quoi that makes a person stand out. Such is the word’s success, particularly online, that it has morphed into a verb, so you can now ‘rizz someone up’ with a charm offensive, or wear ‘rizz-coloured glasses’ if you prioritise this form of sex appeal above all others (stock image)\nIf you hadn’t already spotted a ‘beige flag’ in a potential suitor, you probably will now.\nThis is a quirky characteristic in a love interest which isn’t a deal-breaker but nothing to boast of, either. Perhaps they belt out TV theme tunes in the shower or avoid stepping on cracks in the pavement — you don’t exactly appreciate it, but nor does it inspire the famous ‘ick’.\nOr you may be in a ‘situationship’ — a relationship that is not yet committed. Hopefully it will blossom into something firmer, particularly given enough ‘rizz’.\nOf all the words on this year’s shortlist, ‘rizz’ was the one that really captured the imagination. A shortening of ‘charisma’, it describes that certain charm or je ne sais quoi that makes a person stand out. Such is the word’s success, particularly online, that it has morphed into a verb, so you can now ‘rizz someone up’ with a charm offensive, or wear ‘rizz-coloured glasses’ if you prioritise this form of sex appeal above all others.\nPossibly my favourite pick from Oxford’s 2023 selection was ‘parasocial’, a word that describes the false sense of intimacy many of us tend to feel towards celebrities.\nAs we watch the famous play out their lives on our screens, we have a sense that we ‘know’ them, even feel a sense of ownership. The word is far from new, nor does it exactly trip off the tongue, but it fills a significant gap in our language as we fall further under the spell of life’s influencers.\nFrom sport, we had ‘Bazball’. Used to describe a style of play that focuses on enjoyment and a lack of fear, its use soon extended beyond cricket to embrace the idea of deviating from the normal rules and simply having fun.\n‘Nepo baby’ also made an entrance. Short for ‘nepotism baby’, this snarling invention describes the child of a celebrity who finds their way into the same career as their parents thanks to already having a foot in the door.\nBringing up the rear were ‘UPF’, short for the ultra-processed food that has become the new nutritional nemesis (taking the baton from trans fats and MSG) and ‘debanking’, the decision by a financial institution to deprive an individual of their banking facilities because they no longer suit its ethical or political values.\nHad the bank been powered by intelligence of the artificial kind, Farage might have accused Coutts of ‘hallucinating’, for these days the verb refers to the ability of AI to perceive patterns in data that don’t exist and provide false information as a result (stock image)\nThe word was shoved into a glaring spotlight thanks to the position taken by Coutts that Nigel Farage was the wrong kind of celebrity and they had to get him out of there.\nHad the bank been powered by intelligence of the artificial kind, Farage might have accused Coutts of ‘hallucinating’, for these days the verb refers to the ability of AI to perceive patterns in data that don’t exist and provide false information as a result.\nSo, what of the words of 2024? Predicting the future of language can be a mug’s game, but some themes seem set to remain. One will surely be the wobbly relationship between truth and lies, real news and fake.\nAs Donald Trump gears up for re-election, we may see more of his word confections taking a spin around social media. Few of us have forgotten ‘covfefe’, his apparently mistyped word for ‘coverage’ which has taken on a life of its own and become a synonym for everything from fake news to coffee.\nAs he has always told us: ‘I have words, I have the best words.’\nAI, of course, will become a bigger feature in our lives. Technology has always spawned different ways of speaking, so new vocabulary and a new grammar may well be on the horizon next year, and — excitingly but also rather terrifyingly — they may not be human in origin.\nWe are also likely to hear more of ‘alignment’, a buzzword which, like ‘authentic’, has crept into every aspect of our lives. Countries, companies and couples all strive to align themselves with the right ‘core values’ (there’s another).\nWhatever 2024 brings, it’s worth remembering that the latest words are rarely inventions that no one has seen the like of before.\nThis romantic notion of how language evolves crumbles when you know that only one per cent of all new coinages are spangly apparitions from the ether. The vast majority are riffs or mashups of existing words: a process of repurposing that has played out since English began.\nThis means that, linguistically at least, there is nothing to fear. In fact, when it comes to new words, there is everything to play for. They are our shop window, the face of English that we love to debate, laugh at and moan about.\nAnd they tell us where we’re at: you only have to hear ‘flapper’, ‘bebop’, ‘hula hoop’, ‘ladette’ or ‘glasnost’ to instantly picture the time they were born in.\nIn a hundred years, speakers of the future will be able to look back at this century and pinpoint exactly what was going on through the prism of its words.\nIt’s on us to make those words worthwhile. Forget alignment, let’s rizz things up while we have the chance.\nInteresting Stories About Curious Words, by Susie Dent (John Murray Press, £14.99). © Susie Dent 2023.

    "text": "La posible impugnación del examen divide a los opositores de Infantil\nLos aspirantes creen que «la repetición del supuesto no es justa, el proceso no es objetivo y no garantiza la igualdad de oportunidades»\nLa división de opiniones entre los 1.302 aspirantes a una plaza fija en Educación Infantil es evidente. Ni creen que la repetición del examen ... de forma voluntaria asegure la igualdad de oportunidades, ni consideran ninguna otra opción garantista, ni están de acuerdo con el grupo de personas que se está asesorando jurídicamente para impugnar el proceso completo.\nY a todo esto, hay que sumarle los bulos y los «miles de mensajes al día» que reciben los opositores: «Me están creando más ansiedad». Y esta es una sensación generalizada, especialmente entre quienes se presentan a la oposición por primera vez. Alicia es una de esas personas. Se ha estrenado en el proceso de empleo público en una convocatoria rodeada de controversia. Y, bajo su punto de vista, «el movimiento que hay para impugnar el examen es egoísta». Cree que la decisión de este grupo «depende de la nota que han sacado en la primera parte» –la que no se prevé repetir– y que el proceso judicial, que en caso de seguir adelante implicaría volver a empezar la convocatoria, «podría tardar años en resolverse». Así, dicen, «solo se conseguiría alargar el proceso de oposición, pero el curso en septiembre empezará sí o sí».\n¿Quiénes están movilizando la impugnación? Los aspirantes más cercanos a una plaza fija. Cuando lo que está en riesgo es alcanzar un puesto definitivo, con años de antigüedad y varias convocatorias a las espaldas, «lo que hay en juego es mucho». Pero como explica Ana, otra de las aspìrantes, «la impugnación no soluciona nada». Tampoco la repetición voluntaria: «Se dé la situación que se dé, con un examen igual, más fácil o más difícil, la gente se va a quejar. Pero entrar en una reclamación judicial solo va a hacer que tardemos más tiempo en trabajar y en meter la cabeza en las listas».\nAmbas aspirantes se presentan con posibilidad de acceder a la bolsa por primera vez. Pero su pensamiento se extiende entre quienes no debutan en el proceso, es decir, docentes que ya están trabajando. Una de las opositoras en activo, que ha preferido guardar su identidad, coincide con ellas. «Me da mucho miedo porque es un proceso que requiere de un gran esfuerzo. Lo tendríamos que repetir sabiendo que el año que viene hay una nueva oportunidad. Creo que es porque la gente no quiere asumir las consecuencias y el riesgo que supone presentarse a una oposición».\nSi, finalmente, los aspirantes deciden impugnar el proceso, los pasos a seguir los marcará el ámbito jurídico. «Lo más importante es que se garantice la igualdad y objetividad para desarrollar la prueba», afirman. Pero las alegaciones podrían retrasar aún más el proceso para los participantes: «Se podría demorar meses o años. Y esto se traduce en que se tarde más en actualizar el sistema de empleo, las bolsas de interinos». Aún así, «los centros educativos deben seguir funcionando».\nPrecisamente, a los colegios también ha llegado el malestar. Muchos de los docentes interinos tienen que volver a enfrentarse al examen práctico. Y algunos de los que atesoran una plaza fija forman parte de los tribunales que van a corregir las pruebas. Todos ellos debaten sobre si es justa la repetición. Pero tampoco tienen claro si impugnar el proceso al completo será efectivo. «Los tribunales también se ven perjudicados», plantea una de las aspirantes. «Hay, incluso, compañeros que están poniendo en duda si en la prueba del sábado, al volver a abrir las plicas, van a mantener el anonimato aún con las indicaciones de la Consejería para el sistema de apertura». Igualmente, creen que «corregir el supuesto después del revuelo tampoco va a ser sencillo».\nDos opciones\nA pesar de los rumores, sí que comparten que las situaciones más probables son dos: que la prueba se repita, con el enfado y revuelo de los más de mil opositores, o que el grupo de aspirantes que baraja la impugnación siga adelante con ella. Ninguna de las dos convence del todo. En el primero de los casos, «la gente va a estar enfadada; una segunda oportunidad por un error de planteamiento nos hace salir de puntos de partida distintos». Y es que, tener que volver a hacer el supuesto práctico de manera opcional para unos y obligatoria para otros, «no es justo y dificulta que sea anónimo y objetivo. No garantiza la igualdad de oportunidades». Y en el caso de la impugnación, «nos enfrentaríamos de nuevo a todo el proceso, después del trabajo y esfuerzo de años, dejando de lado nuestra vida personal, familia, amigos, viajes... Es volver a pasar por todo el agotamiento mental».\nCon las cartas encima de la mesa, «demasiada información» y la repetición a tan solo unos días, «los nervios y el enfado aumentan de golpe». Y la principal preocupación es el examen: «Estamos más cansados, pensábamos poder desconectar y ahora tenemos que repetirlo».\n¿Tienes una suscripción? Inicia sesión",

    "text": "Three baby sisters have smashed odds of 200 million to one after being born as genetically identical triplets .\nLittle Willow, Nancie and Mabel Davies will grow up as the spitting images of each other, scientists say. Proud parents Louise and Gareth Davies decided to carry out genetic testing on the triplets after being intrigued by their similar faces. And experts found the eight-week-old girls are super-rare identical sisters after examining their matching genes .\nLouise said: “We are over the moon with the results. We couldn’t be happier to know that the girls are all identical.”\nThe couple from Huddersfield, West Yorks, found they were expecting triplets after a scan 12 weeks into Louise’s pregnancy . The tots arrived on November 10 last year at 34 weeks. Willow was 4lb 8oz, Nancie was 5lb and Mabel tipped the scales at 4lb 11oz.\nGenetics lab NorthGene, in Deeside, North Wales, confirmed the couple’s suspicions. Their scientists said the chances of all three triplets being identical are 200 million to one, yet this is their third case in three years.\nTeam leader Charlotte Haskayne said: “Knowing we have made a difference in people’s lives is the reason why we do what we do.” Shauna Leven, chief executive of Twins Trust which supports families of multiple births, said: “It’s so important to allow them to establish themselves as individuals. This includes everything from dressing them differently to spending dedicated time with each child. It also means thinking carefully about their individual educational needs when they start school. We wish them well.”",
