    "text": "The thing to remember about American politics is that the deck is stacked. In most races, in most places, the winner of the election is decided before the campaign begins: by the gerrymandering of election district lines, by the\npower of incumbency, by the influence of money, and by media outlets that prefer the manufactured drama of a two-party grudge match. According to the election reform group FairVote’s most recent “Dubious Democracy” report, the United States suffers from a “chronic lack of competition” in races for the U.S. House of Representatives, as illustrated by the fact that only thirty-five of the 435 contests in 2022 met the baseline standard for offering voters a genuine choice.\nEven when there is competition, it is constrained by a political duopoly that—in races for everything from the presidency to governorships, Senate seats, House seats, state legislative seats, and local posts—consists of a Democratic Party that is heavily invested in the economic and political status quo and a Republican Party that, while more authoritarian in approach and more extreme on social issues, is frequently funded by the same corporate interests as the Democrats.\nThe range of debate often extends from one side of Wall Street to the other—creating a system that Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has\ncomplained “spends more time representing the wealthy and the powerful than ordinary Americans.”\nOn top of all this, the system is showing signs of severe strain, as one party\nevolves into a cult of personality, while the other has been torn apart by a debate over whether to continue to support an aging leader whose capacity to win elections and govern is now widely questioned. A growing number of Americans tell pollsters that they are sick of both parties and desperately want alternatives.\nThe United States, uniquely among its most major democratic allies on the global stage, makes no pretense of being a robust multiparty democracy. The current German government is a\ncoalition of the center-left Social Democrats, the climate-focused Greens, and the socially liberal but business-friendly Free Democrats. In the United Kingdom, where July 4 election results swept the rightwing Conservative Party from power, the new parliament will be dominated by the center-left Labour Party. But it will also include seventy-two members of the Liberal Democratic Party, which sometimes positions to the left of Labour; twenty members of Scottish, Welsh, and Irish nationalist parties, which frequently position to the left of Labour; four members of the proudly progressive Green Party; and six independents who were elected at least in part because of their advocacy for a ceasefire in Gaza. In Canada, there is considerable discussion about whether the next government will be a coalition featuring two parties that already work closely in the current parliament: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals and the left-leaning New Democrats, led by civil liberties lawyer Jagmeet Singh.\nThere is no such political diversity or fluidity in the United States. While multiple parties exist, the last time a new party hit the main stage was in 1856, when the Republicans\nreplaced the Whigs. No third-party member has been elected to a seat in Congress since the 1970s, when two members of the Conservative Party of New York won races for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House. The New York Conservatives got their start as a party that protested what they saw as the leftward drift of the GOP in the 1960s, but that’s not much of a concern these days.\nThe United States seems to have settled into a two-party rut that, while unsatisfying to most Americans, is reinforced by a system that provides few openings for alternative candidates and parties. A number of communities and states have\nadopted forms of proportional representation and instant-runoff voting that give third parties a chance at the local and regional levels. But when it comes to federal politics, most Americans assume they are stuck with a binary choice that leaves voters dissatisfied and challenges unresolved. Bold proposals for ending the U.S. Senate’s electoral bias in favor of small, conservative states go unconsidered. Even reforms that were once entertained by the administration of former President Richard Nixon—such as the elimination of the Electoral College so that Presidents could be elected by the popular vote—are brushed aside by the political and media elites that tell us that we dare not look beyond the boundaries of an increasingly dysfunctional two-party system.\nThere is no question that today’s Democratic and Republican parties differ on many economic and social issues and that choices between them have consequences. Yet, on a striking number of issues, they find common ground. Consider the debate about Gaza. When the top lawyer with the International Criminal Court applied for an arrest warrant to charge top Israeli officials—as well as Hamas leaders—with war crimes and crimes against humanity, Democratic President Joe Biden\ndecried,calling%20the%20move%20%22outrageous%22.) the move as “outrageous.” So, too, did Republican Donald Trump’s allies in Congress, who organized a House resolution—which passed with bipartisan support—to rebuke the court.\nContrast that with the response of Cornel West, who is challenging Biden and Trump as an independent. West applauded the legal action,\nsaying, “I think there’s no doubt that genocide is taking place.” Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said the United States needs a President who can “act like a commander-in-chief, not a secretary for Bibi Netanyahu.” And Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party nominee for President, https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/5/27/end-the-genocide-says-us-libertarian-presidential-candidate-chase-oliver Biden’s failure to stand up to the Israeli prime minister, while at the same time referring to Trump as a “neocon war criminal.”\nThe United States seems to have settled into a two-party rut that is reinforced by a system that provides few openings for alternative candidates and parties.\nThose were not fringe positions. National polls have suggested that a substantial plurality of Americans, and in some surveys a majority,\nbelieve that the Israeli military—operating on Netanyahu’s orders—is committing genocide in Gaza. “A majority of women, a majority of people of color, a majority of Democrats and progressives and young people believe that this is genocide,” explained University of Massachusetts-Amherst political science professor Tatishe M. Nteta, who directed a national UMass-Amherst/WCVB survey on the issue earlier this year. “Whereas, on the other side, you see Republicans and conservatives, older Americans, men having an opposite view. This issue has become, in some ways, a flash point or at least a reflection of many of the divides that we see in our country today.”\nYet, when the first presidential debate took place on June 27, only Biden and Trump were on stage. And when the subject of Gaza came up, Foreign Policy\nobserved, “Both candidates, as expected, issued full-throated endorsements of Israel.” There was no serious discussion of genocide, ICC warrants, or a two-state solution. In fact, there was very little debate at all. Trump lied about his record, and Biden’s, with such frequency that former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci estimated that his ex-boss produced a prevarication “every 100 seconds” during the ninety-minute standoff. Biden’s struggle to keep up with his rival’s rapid-fire fibbing was so unsuccessful that his dismal presentation inspired a vigorous debate about his capacity to continue on as the presumptive Democratic nominee.\nEven before the debate, an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll\nfound that 55 percent of U.S. adults said they were not satisfied with the choice between Biden and Trump. “This is not a happy electorate,” https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/heres-how-americans-feel-about-biden-and-trump-as-election-season-revs-up#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20not%20a%20happy,to%20have%20to%20pick%20from.%E2%80%9D poll director Lee Miringoff, “but it is one that is starting to deal with the realities that these two are the choices they’re going to have to pick from.” On the surface level, that’s true. Candidates who aren’t associated with the two major parties are running. But they’ve been kept off the debate stages for the past three decades—and more generally, off the radar.\nMedia coverage of this year’s alternative candidates—with the exception of independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a famous name and a penchant for posing for\npictures with animal carcasses—is very nearly nonexistent. And when third-party contenders are mentioned, it is usually as part of a warning that ballots cast for anyone other than the major party contenders will be “wasted.” That creates a political “reality” that voters think is unavoidable. Thus, post-debate polls that included Biden, Trump, and the independent and third-party prospects generally had the major party contenders splitting somewhere in the range of 85 to 90 percent of the vote, while RFK Jr. was in the high single digits and Stein, West, and Oliver trailed behind.\nShutterstock\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., running for President in 2024 as an independent.\nBut when we scratch the surface, another picture emerges. Americans aren’t just frustrated with this pair of contenders in this particular presidential election. A Pew Research Center\nsurvey from 2022 found that 61 percent of Americans have a negative view of the Republican Party, while 57 percent have a negative view of the Democratic Party. Even accounting for the excesses of partisanship on each side of the political divide, those numbers suggest that millions of Americans are turned off by both parties. Among voters under age thirty, disdain for the major parties has skyrocketed.\nA\nGallup poll, conducted about a year after the Pew survey, found that 63 percent of U.S. adults agreed with a statement that the Republican and Democratic parties do “such a poor job” of representing the American people that “a third major party is needed.” That number has steadily risen over the past two decades, according to Gallup, despite the fact that when third parties are mentioned in the media, it is usually to dismiss them as “spoilers.”\nThe “spoiler” question is already getting plenty of attention this year. Both major parties, and their media echo chambers, are concerned about the prospect that Kennedy, the nephew of a Democratic President and the son of a Democratic presidential contender who in recent years has become a favorite with conspiracy theorists, will harm their prospects. Polls suggest that RFK Jr.\ndraws support from Trump and Biden, which has led both parties to seek to thwart his efforts to get on ballots around the country. But the Greens and the Libertarians, which have decades-long histories of party building, will be on most state ballots, and you can bet that there will be plenty of warnings from the Democrats and the Republicans, telling voters to stay clear of what they dismiss as “minor parties.”\nMost will do just that, especially as concerns about the threat posed by the antidemocratic\nProject 2025 playbook have caused many voters to believe that blocking Trump and the Republicans is mission-critical.\nBut the tendency to see third parties and independents merely as threats or, at best, annoyances misses the reality that they have a long history of contributing ideas to the political process in the United States—from Socialist\nadvocates for old-age pensions (Social Security) and health care programs (Medicare and Medicaid) to Libertarian champions of LGBTQ+ rights and drug-law reform and Green contenders who have demanded that the climate crisis and U.S. militarism be addressed.\nIt also misses the reality that third parties can play a critical role in averting the crises that are created by major parties, as illustrated by what happened in France this summer.\nIn the\nJune 9 elections for seats in the European Parliament, the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) party and its allies finished first, with one-third of the vote. That was a dramatic improvement in the position of the National Rally, which was founded by a convicted Holocaust denier, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and Pierre Bousquet, who during World War II was a section leader in the Nazi Waffen-SS. While current party leader Marine Le Pen, daughter of Jean-Marie, has tried to soften the image of the historically racist and xenophobic party, the strong showing for the National Rally sent shockwaves through French politics. President Emmanuel Macron responded by calling snap legislative elections in order to determine whether the French people were really prepared to accept political extremism that, since World War II, had been recognized as wholly unacceptable.\nUnfortunately, Macron\nsuffered from low approval ratings, and his Ensemble political coalition was weak, unfocused, and divided. After being crushed in the European Parliament voting—falling behind the National Rally by an almost 3-1 margin and losing ten seats—there were real questions about whether it could muster the energy or the resolve to stop the march of a rightwing movement that many commentators have identified as a modern expression of fascism—and that others compared with the MAGA movement of Donald Trump, a Marine Le Pen fan. Luckily for France, and the world, it wasn’t necessary to wait for the ill-advised and unpopular Macron to sort things out.\nShutterstock\nJean-Luc Mélenchon, founder of the leftwing France Unbowed Party, a member party of the New Popular Front.\nFrance is a true multi-party democracy with multiple groupings on the right, in the center, and on the left. The leading figure on the left, three-time presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, brought his popular France Unbowed party into alliance with the Socialist Party of former Presidents François Mitterrand and François Hollande, the Greens, and the historic French Communist Party to form the\nNew Popular Front (NPF). The parties maintained their distinct identities and ideological stances, but they came together with a common goal of beating the far-right threat. And it worked.\nRunning on a radical platform that promised to tax the rich, raise wages, lower the retirement age, cap prices on food and other essentials, legislate for carbon neutrality, and seek a full ceasefire in Gaza, the NPF stole the populist thunder from the right and finished first in the decisive second round of voting. The NPF will form the largest grouping in the new parliament, while Macron and his allies will form the second-largest camp, and Le Pen’s vanquished National Rally will form the third bloc.\nIt is often said multiparty democracy creates confusion and complexity, and that can be the case. But it can also produce dynamic responses to challenges that mainstream parties fail even to grasp—let alone meet. In France, Mélenchon and the New Popular Front proved what is possible. That’s something the American left should consider as it looks to the future. The 2024 election will be run along the old rules, and the threat posed by Trump and his MAGA movement leaves no margin for error in the eyes of many progressives like Sanders and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York.\nWhen the current threat has passed, however, and Americans are thinking about how to avert the next one, there is a strong case to be made for bold changes to our electoral system. Proportional representation, instant-runoff voting, and the radical reform of presidential and Congressional elections, as well as open debates and more freewheeling media coverage, might break the grip of a two-party system that has produced a 2024 contest that leaves most voters frustrated, angry, and increasingly disenchanted with the American experiment.",

    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Un hombre de Scottsdale, quien fue previamente condenado por participar en algo parecido a un esquema piramidal, fue condenado a prisión de nuevo tras declararse culpable de múltiples delitos relacionados con robos. El año pasado, la policía de Scottsdale arrestó a Robert F. Alexander, de 59 años, después de que lo descrubrieron estafando dinero de personas que creían que estaba organizando un torneo de golf benéfico con el nombre de Wounder Warrior Project, una organización sin fines de lucro para veteranos militares. Cuando los golfistas descubrieron que el torneo era un evento inexistente, intentaron obtener su dinero de vuelta y comenzaron a hablar con la policía. Uno de los golfistas que le dio dinero a Alexander dijo que no detectó ningunas “señales de alarma” cuando el acusado se le acercó en el campo de golf. Los investigadores descubrieron que Alexander también estaba involucrado por visitar campos de golf para recolectar inversiones para un negocio de reventa de pelotas de golf que supuestamente estaba dirigiendo. Registros de la corte muestran que Alexander recientemente aceptó acuerdos de culpabilidad en cinco casos criminales presentados en la Corte Superior del Condado Maricopa. El mes pasado, fue condenado a siete años en prisión, y se le ordenó pagar aproximadamente $377,000 en restitución a varias víctimas. Tras salir de prisión, Alexander será puesto libertad condicional durante varios años. Alexander parece tener un historial de intentar estafar dinero a las personas en Arizona. Hace varios años, la Comisión de Corporaciones de Arizona le ordenó a Alexander pagar $382,000 en restitución por engañar a los locales a invertir en un negocio fraudulento de pelotas de golf. En el 2006, Alexander se declaró culpable de los cargos relacionados con un supuesto esquema piramidal y fue condenado a ocho años en prisión federal.

    "title": "Beloved Music Festival Goes on Indefinite Hiatus: Latest on Sol Fest",
    "text": "After three successful years of bringing bass music to Florida, Sol Fest organizers have announced the festival will pause operations indefinitely, citing numerous challenges that have plagued the independent event since its 2022 launch.\nThe announcement came via social media, where organizers reflected on the festival’s journey and impact. “This festival has always been a labor of love, a way to celebrate life in honor of our dear friend Sol while celebrating the music, art, and community that means so much to us,” the statement read. “This chapter has been difficult to close as our journey has touched the lives of many, including Sol’s friends and family.”\nVideos by PopCulture.com\nThe event faced significant obstacles from its inception. EDM.com reports that early challenges included the unexpected death of their original venue’s CEO, forcing a last-minute location change. “We did whatever it took to create a new welcoming home, starting a year in advance meeting with officials and unexpectedly preparing the venues at our own expense,” organizers explained.\nThe most recent edition showcased prominent electronic artists, including Rezz, CloZee, LSDREAM, Bob Moses, Elderbrook, Dr. Fresch, G Jones, Lettuce, Dabin, and Of The Trees. However, the festival weekend was marred by several incidents, including a car fire, logistical problems, and intensive law enforcement searches.\nDespite these setbacks, the festival built an impressive following during its run. In their announcement posted to Instagram, organizers expressed gratitude to the “10,000+ beautiful souls that came from every state and all around the world,” acknowledging how their support empowered “independent promoters and hundreds of incredible independent artists, to create 3 special festivals together.”\nThe organizers emphasized their commitment throughout the challenges: “Through it all, Sol Fest has had our unwavering commitment, as we’ve poured our time, energy and resources into making this vision a reality. The road hasn’t been easy, but your support has been the driving force that kept us going.”\nSince its launch in 2022, Sol Fest had established itself as a unique presence in Florida’s electronic music scene, particularly known for its bass-focused lineups and strong sense of community. The festival aimed to offer a fresh perspective on the electronic music festival experience while honoring the memory of its namesake.\nWhile the hiatus marks the end of an era, organizers haven’t completely closed the door on future events. “This isn’t goodbye, Sol Fam. For now, hold your loved ones close and keep the Sol Fest spirit alive!” they wrote, suggesting the possibility of an eventual return. The statement concluded with recognition for those who helped bring the vision to life: “We want to extend our deepest appreciation to the entire team, volunteers, friends, and family who helped us bring this to life.”",

    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solidion Technology, Inc. (Solidion), an advanced battery technology solutions provider, aims to address the burgeoning battery materials supply shortage, driven by anticipated soaring demand for electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS) battery capacities.\nSolidion plans to build a graphite production facility in the Southeast United States with an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum (MTA) by the end of 2026, which will be expanded to ~180,000 MTA by 2030 to fulfill the growing domestic demand. This US domestic facility will manufacture graphite anode materials primarily from biomass, an abundant and sustainable class of feedstock materials for battery-grade graphite production in North America.\nAccording to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence 1 , the annual worldwide graphite demand in 2035 is forecast to be 12.4 million metric tons (7.2 million tons of natural graphite and 5.2 million tons of synthetic graphite). As of 2022, the production capacity of the graphite industry was only 3.2 million tons per year. By 2035, the world will need additional 97 natural graphite mines, each producing 56,000 tons, and additional 54 synthetic graphite factories, each producing 57,000 tons per year.\nAccording to a recent Department of Energy report, China produced 84% of the global lithium-ion anode materials in 2021, whereas the domestic sources produced only 0.6% per annum. The US supply shortage will likely worsen as China has stated that it intends to put in place graphite export restrictions beginning in December 2022.\nHaving developed a cost-effective process for mass-manufacturing green graphite anode materials from sustainable biomass sources, Solidion’s years of in-depth R&D and anode manufacturing experience put it in a unique position to capitalize on the rapidly changing EV battery materials market.\nAbout Solidion Technology, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas with pilot production facilities in Dayton, Ohio, Solidion’s core business includes manufacturing of battery materials and components, as well as development and production of next-generation batteries for energy storage systems and electric vehicles for ground, air, and sea transportation. Recognized as a global IP leader in both the high-capacity anode and the high-energy solid-state battery, Solidion is uniquely positioned to offer two lines of battery products: (i) advanced anode materials (ready for production expansion); and (ii) three classes of solid-state batteries, including Silicon-rich all-solid-state lithium-ion cells (Gen 1), anodeless lithium metal cells (Gen 2), and lithium-sulfur cells (Gen 3), all featuring an advanced polymer- or polymer/inorganic composite-based solid electrolyte that is process-friendly. Solidion’s solid-state batteries can be manufactured at scale using current lithium-ion cell production facilities; this feature enables fastest time-to-market of safe solid-state batteries. Solidion batteries are designed to deliver significantly extended EV range, improved battery safety, lower cost per KWh, fastest time-to-market, and next-gen cathodes (potential to replace expensive nickel and cobalt with sulfur (S) and other more abundant elements).\nSolidion Technology Inc.

    "text": "Diffusé dans les salles obscures depuis ce 21 aout, Project Silence, porté par la star de Parasite, peine à convaincre malgré un postulat prometteur.\nNouveau\nfilm du réalisateur sud-coréen Kim Tae-gon — 10 ans après son dernier film The King of Jokgu —, Project Silence s’intéresse à la survie de personnages coincés sur un point effondré, une nuit de brouillard, alors que des chiens militaires modifiés génétiquement par une entreprise s’échappent de leur convoi.\nProject Silence, un pari décevant\nEntre\nscience-fiction et film catastrophe, le nouveau long-métrage de Kim Tae-gon, comparé au nouveau « phénoméne cinématographique coréen » avait, sur le papier, tout pour convaincre ses spectateurs, rappelant par moments le postulat haletant de créations originales comme Le Dernier train pour Busan (2016).\nToutefois, le manque de moyens — les effets spéciaux entourant les chiens sont particulièrement décevants — tout comme l’absence d’écriture autour des personnages peinent à convaincre, donnant au film les couleurs d’une série B, bien plus qu’une véritable proposition artistique étonnante.\nLors du\nFestival de Cannes de 2023, Project Silence s’est illustré lors des fameuses séances de minuit, et a fait la part belle au film catastrophe de genre, qui cartonne autant en Corée qu’en France, véritable eldorado du nouveau cinéma d’auteur.\nNéanmoins, le scénario et la mise en scène, deux arguments qui constituaient l’intérêt initial du film, manquent de subtilité. Ainsi, le brouillard qui aurait pu représenter un challenge scénographie prometteur tombe à plat, tandis que le postulat de départ ne décolle jamais. Cependant, Project Silence doit son salut à son casting, et notamment à Lee Sun-kyun, décédé en 2023, qui incarne dans le film un père de famille bien décidé à protéger sa fille coûte que coûte face à ces attaques pour le moins singulières et imprévisibles.\nLe dernier film de Lee Sun-kyun\nL’année passée, la nouvelle avait fait le tour du monde : l’acteur coréen\nLee Sun-kyun, 48 ans, était retrouvé mort au volant de sa voiture le 27 décembre 2023.\nLe comédien célèbre pour son rôle de père de famille fortuné dans le\nfilm Parasite (2019) de Bong Joon-Ho était particulièrement connu et apprécié du cinéma coréen, et son dernier film, Project Silence, diffusé dans les salles françaises depuis le 21 août, vient conclure une carrière cinématographique de plus de 14 ans. Lee Sun-kyun n’a pas forcément tourné dans beaucoup de films, mais est vite devenu un visage reconnaissable du cinéma asiatique.\nÀ 48 ans, le dernier rôle de Lee Sun-Kyun vient finalement souligner le caractère paternel de l’acteur, souvent choisi pour interpréter des personnages charismatiques et protecteurs. L’un des arguments fort de ce Project Silence.\nProject Silence de Kim Tae-gon avec Lee Sun-kyun, 1h36, depuis le 21 août 2024 au cinéma.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "La comida procesada es capaz de provocar más adicción que las drogas, y la industria lo sabe",
    "text": "La comida procesada es capaz de provocar más adicción que las drogas, y la industria lo sabe\nNicolás Fdez Darna\nCuando hablamos de adicción, se nos vienen a la cabeza imágenes de diferentes drogas como el tabaco, el alcohol o el cannabis. Pero difícilmente pensaremos en las chuches, las patatas fritas o las chocolatinas. Un nuevo libro del escritor Michael Moss nos demuestra que deberíamos empezar a tener este tipo de productos en cuenta.\nUna adicción es un vicio del que no podemos escapar y que nos va dañando con el tiempo, física o psicológicamente. Pero decir solo eso se quedaría muy corto.\nLa naturaleza adictiva no tiene tanto que ver con la sustancia que produce esa dependencia, sino con el cerebro y el cuerpo del individuo que se vuelve adicto. Hay muchas personas que fuman o beben alcohol y no son adictos, ya que no dependen de esas substancias.\nAdemás, los síntomas que genera una adicción no tienen por qué ser los mismos en diferentes personas. Determinadas adicciones no provocan un dolor interno o un «mono físico» evidente, sino que van más por dentro. Están en nuestra mente y puede que ni nos demos cuenta.\nY aquí es donde llegamos al verdadero quid de la cuestión: todas las adicciones se desarrollan en nuestro cerebro. De hecho, existe un elemento que influye de forma determinante en la naturaleza adictiva de una sustancia: el circuito de recompensa, que es la parte del cerebro que nos aporta placer ante determinado estímulo.\nCuanto más rápido llegue una sustancia a nuestro circuito de recompensa, mayor será su impacto en nuestro organismo. Por esa razón, una droga intravenosa estimula más que el cannabis, y fumar produce mayor sentimiento de recompensa que usar un parche de nicotina.\nLa comida basura, una gran adicción\nExiste algo que activa nuestro circuito de recompensa mucho más rápido que cualquier droga: nuestra comida procesada favorita. Según Michael Moss, autor del libro Hooked, «El humo de los cigarrillos tarda 10 segundos en agitar el cerebro, pero un toque de azúcar en la lengua lo hará en poco más de medio segundo, o seiscientos milisegundos, para ser precisos. Eso es casi 20 veces más rápido que los cigarrillos».\nEsto quiere decir que la comida basura puede llegar a ser mucho más adictiva que la droga. Y si lo pensamos fríamente, a mucha gente le costaría menos dejar el tabaco que el chocolate, las patatas fritas o las galletas industriales.\nDe hecho, esto viene de lejos. Una encuesta americana realizada en 1988 ya pidió a las personas que nombraran las cosas que pensaban que eran adictivas y luego las calificaran en una escala del 1 al 10, siendo 10 el más adictivo. Fumar recibió un 8.5, casi a la par que la heroína. Pero el consumo excesivo de este tipo de productos no se quedó atrás, con un 7.3, por encima de la cerveza, los tranquilizantes y las pastillas para dormir.\nLa trampa de las empresas alimentarias\nAnte esta realidad, algunas empresas alimentarias han sabido aprovechar muy bien el componente adictivo de determinados productos en nuestro cerebro. Por ello, la composición de muchos alimentos procesados ha sido minuciosamente diseñada para generar más adicción en los consumidores, con ello vender más unidades y, por ende, ganar más dinero.\nEstas empresas diseñan la comida basura para lograr ese «punto de felicidad» que las hace irresistibles y comercializan muchos productos utilizando tácticas tomadas de la industria del tabaco. Tanto es así, que hasta la famosa tabacalera Philip Morris adquirió empresas alimentarias como Kraft y General Foods, convirtiéndose en el mayor productor de alimentos procesados de Estados Unidos en los años 80.\nPor otro lado, muchas empresas alimentarias compraron otras compañías dedicadas a productos dietéticos. De esta manera, por un lado generan adicción y engordan a la población con sus productos, y por otro ofrecen el remedio para adelgazar.\nTodo esto es lo que sostiene el investigador y ganador de un Pulitzer, Michael Moss en su último libro, HookedHooked (disponible en Amazon), a través de numerosos documentos internos y varias entrevistas con expertos de la industria alimentaria.\n[disponible en Amazon](https://amzn.to/39hQx1x)\n«He estado arrastrándome a través de la parte más vulnerable de la industria de alimentos procesados durante 10 años y sigo asombrado por la profundidad de la astucia de su estrategia, no solo para aprovechar nuestros instintos básicos, sino también para explotar nuestros intentos de controlar nuestros hábitos», concluye el autor.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=La%20comida%20procesada%20es%20capaz%20de%20provocar%20m%C3%A1s%20adicci%C3%B3n%20que%20las%20drogas%2C%20y%20la%20industria%20lo%20sabe%20https://www.elcorreogallego.es/vida-y-estilo/salud/guia/2024/12/20/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785581.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.elcorreogallego.es/vida-y-estilo/salud/guia/2024/12/20/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785581.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.elcorreogallego.es/vida-y-estilo/salud/guia/2024/12/20/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785581.html&text=La%20comida%20procesada%20es%20capaz%20de%20provocar%20m%C3%A1s%20adicci%C3%B3n%20que%20las%20drogas%2C%20y%20la%20industria%20lo%20sabe%20%20https://www.elcorreogallego.es/vida-y-estilo/salud/guia/2024/12/20/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785581.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40elcorreogallego) [RRSS email](mailto:?subject=La%20comida%20procesada%20es%20capaz%20de%20provocar%20m%C3%A1s%20adicci%C3%B3n%20que%20las%20drogas%2C%20y%20la%20industria%20lo%20sabe%20&body=https://www.elcorreogallego.es/vida-y-estilo/salud/guia/2024/12/20/comida-procesada-capaz-provocar-adiccion-112785581.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [Copiar URL](javascript: void(0)) [Borja Iglesias y María Valero se rinden a los encantos de este popular establecimiento gallego: 'Es increíble para salir de la rutina](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/2024/12/17/borja-iglesias-maria-valero-rinden-112701877.html) [Más de la mitad de los dueños de eucalipto son pensionistas, viven fuera de Galicia o han muerto](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/economia/2024/12/18/perfil-propietarios-eucalipto-112705755.html) [Una antigua carnicería pasa a ser una de las cafeterías más agradables de Santiago: especialistas en repostería artesanal y 'pet friendly](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/2024/12/16/antigua-carniceria-transforma-cafeterias-agradables-dv-112664444.html) [Cambio importante en la normativa: prohibido pescar en esta zona de Santiago a partir de 2025](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/2024/12/16/prohibida-pesca-trucha-8-kilometros-sar-santiago-112672911.html) [La onda expansiva del pacto del La Salle contra los móviles: 'Nos llaman padres del Peleteiro y otros colegios para informarse](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/2024/12/16/onda-expansiva-pacto-salle-moviles-112657147.html) [La tarta de castaña más famosa de O Courel se vende únicamente en una pequeña tienda de Santiago de Compostela](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/2024/12/17/tarta-castana-famosa-o-courel-dv-112688635.html) [Cabify refuerza su apuesta en Galicia y aterriza en Santiago: disponible a través de la app desde este miércoles](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/2024/12/18/cabify-refuerza-apuesta-galicia-aterriza-112734791.html) [¿Por qué se llama 'Roxa' esta plaza de Santiago de Compostela?](https://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/2024/12/16/primer-nombre-jose-antonio-paso-dv-112654834.html)",

    "title": "Australian severe storms declared insurance catastrophe as claims soar",
    "text": "Insurance claims filed after the severe thunderstorms, convective weather and hail that struck eastern parts of Australia over the Christmas period, resulting in flooding and property damage, have soared and with more extreme weather events anticipated, the Insurance Council has designated the events an insurance catastrophe. We reported earlier this week that the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) has declared a “significant event” for the severe weather that had affected the eastern side of Australia. Parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria were particularly badly hit and as of December 27th more than 7,500 claims related to the storms had been received across the three states. Now though, with severe weather having continued and more in the forecast for the eastern states of Australia, the Insurance Council said it has “escalated its response to severe storms impacting Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria since 23 December, declaring an Insurance Catastrophe.” As of this morning, the number of claims filed with insurers has risen significantly to 18,174 claims related to the storms across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, 10,716 of which are from the Gold Coast region alone, the ICA explained. ICA COO Kylie Macfarlane, commented, “Given the immense scale and destructive nature of these storms across eastern Australia, the Insurance Council and insurers are escalating our response to a Catastrophe level to better serve the immediate and future needs of our customers. “Insurers expect claims volumes to grow in the coming days as more residents gain access to properties and power is restored to some areas, however, it is too early to understand the cost of the damage.” Property and auto damage is reported to have been significant and with flooding yet to subside in some areas, while more severe weather is forecast with large hail possible, it seems the claims burden is likely to keep rising and this could become a costly event for the Australian major insurers. It’s impossible to say whether the industry loss from these storms could reach levels where reinsurance support is called on. But the generally higher reinsurance attachment points, as well as reduced use of aggregate reinsurance, should help to ensure more of these storm losses stays with the major primary insurers of Australia, than might have been the case just a few years ago.
