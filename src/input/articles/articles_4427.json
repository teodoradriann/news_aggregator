    "title": "Texas A&M Football: Wright & Mathews speaks after bowl game loss",
    "text": "The 2023 football season has officially come to an end for the Aggie Football team and new head coach Mike Elko has a lot to look forward to in the future.\nI don’t think anyone knew what to expect when the Aggies took the field at NRG Stadium on Wednesday night. Then, when third-string QB Jaylon Henderson was knocked out of the game on the very first play from scrimmage, it appeared that skipping the game altogether might have been the wiser choice.\nHowever, true freshman Marcel Reed , 180 pounds soaking wet, showed that Aggie spirit and fought all game long, giving A&M a fighting chance to the very end. Two seniors, Max Wright and Sam Mathews, played huge roles in keeping the game in reach, capping off their final game in the Maroon & White. Wright finished the game with four receptions for 62 yards and Mathews finished with a career night that he will never forget.\nHis stat line consisted of a team-leading 14 tackles, 1.5 TFLs, and an interception. Max and Sam both talked about their time at A&M and what this season meant to them.\n“Texas A&M, to me, is the perfect representation of what it means to be people of honor and people of character. It’s the best university in the world, and there is no other university like it. I will be an Aggie for the rest of my life.” – Max Wright\n“This season has been one I’ll never forget. Those last weeks might have been my favorite on this team with how everybody bought in and committed to each other. It was special to be a part of.”\nBelow, you can hear everything Max Wright and Sam Mathews had to say following the game.\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on Twitter, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

(WPDE) — New details reveal the suspects of a [ deadly Hartsville park shooting Wednesday night ](https://wpde.com/news/local/one-person-shot-at-hartsville-park-byerly-park)were there for a Facebook Marketplace purchase, according to Hartsville public information officer Michelle Byers Brown. Jeremiah Josey and his brother Jarivion Scott planned to buy a motorcycle from a man via Facebook Marketplace, Byers Brown confirmed. She said the brothers met the man at Byerly Park for the exchange. Byers Brown added Josey then pulled a gun on the man selling the motorcycle and three others. She said the man who was selling the motorcycle was legally armed and felt \"his life and the lives of others were threatened.\" Byers Brown said the man drew his handgun and fired several rounds hitting Josey. The shooter and other witnesses immediately called 911 to report the incident. Hartsville Police, Darlington County Sheriff’s Office and Darlington County EMS responded. EMS transported Josey to Carolina Pines Medical Center. He was then [taken to McLeod Regional Medical Center](https://wpde.com/news/local/one-person-shot-at-hartsville-park-byerly-park) where he later succumbed to his injuries. Byers Brown said Josey was out of jail on bond and under monitored house arrest for two 2022 incidents. She said on January 11, 2022, Josey was charged with kidnapping, armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon during a violent crime by the Hartsville Police Dept. On October 3, 2022, he was charged with attempted murder, armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon during a violent crime by the Darlington County Sheriff’s Office. Josey was reportedly required to wear an ankle monitor. Joey's accomplice, Scott, left the area following the shooting, Byers Brown confirmed. Scott is charged with multiple counts of armed robbery, attempted murder, weapons violations and criminal conspiracy in Wednesday night’s incident. [Byers Brown added](https://wpde.com/news/local/hartsville-byerly-park-shooting-facebook-marketplace-sale-purchase-motorcycle-deadly-jeremiah-josey-jarivion-scott-brothers-darlington-county) Scott was out of jail on bond from a 2023 incident involving 10 charges including possession of deadly weapons, armed robbery, pointing and presenting a firearm, criminal conspiracy and drug charges. On December 8, 2023, Scott was arrested on these charges by the Hartsville Police Dept. Hartsville Police Chief Snellgrove stated: “Let me first say that my heart goes out to the family of the deceased. Losing a family member under any circumstance is a very devastating thing.” Snellgrove further stated, “This was a senseless act of violence that should have never happened. Both suspects were out on bond for violent crimes when they should have still been incarcerated while awaiting trial.” Snellgrove emphasized that this was not a random crime and that the victims were targeted and lured to the park area. This is an isolated incident and there is no reason to believe that there is any further danger to our community because of this incident,\" Chief Snellgrove said. It is relatively common for people to buy and sell items on the internet and meet people that they do not know to exchange those items. Caution should always be taken to ensure the safety of everyone, including: Scott is being held at the Darlington County Detention Center.",

    "text": "West Bank: Sombre Bethlehem marks Christmas with vigil as bombs rain on Gaza [Palestinian Christians](https://www.newarab.com/news/palestine-christians-feel-abandoned-uk-archbishop) held a sombre Christmas vigil in [Bethlehem](https://www.newarab.com/news/three-palestinians-injured-israel-storms-bethlehem-camp) on Saturday, with candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual festive celebrations at the spot where Jesus Christ is believed to be born. Most years Bethlehem basks in the central place it holds in the Christian story of [Jesus' ](https://www.newarab.com/opinion/jesus-was-palestinian-re-politicising-christmas)life, born there in a stable because there was no room for his parents at the inn, and placed in an animal's manger, the humblest of all possible beds. Some 2,000 years later, pilgrims usually flock to the reputed location of that stable in Bethlehem's Byzantine-era [Church of the Nativity](https://www.newarab.com/news/baptismal-font-discovered-bethlehems-church-nativity), where most Christmases there are joyful displays of lights and trees in Manger Square. But with Israel's brutal military campaign in Gaza having killed more than 20,000 people - including thousands of women and children, the mostly Palestinian population of Bethlehem in the Occupied West Bank are in mourning too. Additionally, Gazans are also subject to a complete siege where essentials such as food, fuel and water have been completely cut off, while Israeli forces have ramped up their violent raids in the West Bank, killing over 300 Palestinians since October 7. This year they decided to have no large tree, the usual centrepiece of [Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations](https://www.newarab.com/news/christmas-reborn-bethlehem-after-pandemic-years) because of the carnage taking place only 50km (30 miles) away. And in place of the usual nativity scene, as Christians call the traditional display of figurines representing the holy family, Bethlehem churches this year placed the models amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza. \"Bethlehem is a message. It is not a city, it is a message of peace to the whole world. From this sacred place we convey a message of peace stop the war, stop the blood, the killing and the revenge,\" said Father Ibrahim Faltas, a friar at the vigil. Christians make up around 2% of the population across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories, according to Protecting Holy Land Christians, a campaign organised by the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, with a smaller proportion in Gaza. Meanwhile, the war, ongoing for over two months, has kept away the majority of expected foreign tourists hoping to celebrate [Christmas](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-bans-gazas-christians-bethlehem-celebrations) in Bethlehem. When church leaders convened at Bethlehem in early December to mark the start of Advent, as Christians call the weeks before Christmas, there were few people in the usually crowded streets and squares to watch the pared-down display. \"This Christmas comes to Bethlehem in a different shape. Nowadays Bethlehem, as any other Palestinian city, is in mourning. We feel sad,\" said the town mayor Hanna Hanania, lighting a candle in Manger Square.",
