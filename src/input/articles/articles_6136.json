Es horrible, te pone muy mal, sobre todo porque sos mamá”, comenzó, al ser consultada sobre si había tenido que enfrentar una situación así en su familia. La aclamada cocinera reflexionó además sobre la importancia de escuchar y acompañar en conjunto a los hijos.\nMaru Botana agregó que la pedagogía de la escuela jugó un papel muy importante en el desarrollo del conflicto “Creo que mis hijos van a un colegio donde la verdad charla mucho con los chicos y tienen mucha unión.

    "title": "Skull and Bones: Players Call BS on Unbeatable NPC Ships",
    "text": "Skull and Bones has taken a stab at the high seas of gaming with a realistic pirate experience, but it looks like some players are feeling a little more than just slighted. With frustration brewing over the unbeatable NPC ships, players are crying foul about the battle mechanics that require more than just swashbuckling skills to overcome. Thanks to a recent post by user BadCheese31, players are digging their heels in about encounters where NPC ships are not just hard to take down, but seemingly impossible, and the community is joining in with their own salty tales. What’s the deal with these health-replenishing ships that just won’t quit? Buckle up, we’re diving into the murky waters of player frustrations.\nSummary\n- Players are frustrated with what they perceive to be unbeatable NPC ships in Skull and Bones, sparking heated discussions.\n- The existence of repair ships that can heal other vessels at an alarming rate has become a central point of contention.\n- Community members are split between suggesting tactical strategies and questioning the game’s balance.\n- Some players feel the difficulty is unrealistically steep, akin to an impossible boss fight.\nThe NPC Ship Enigma\nThe crux of the players’ outrage stems from a key element of combat: NPC ships that seem to have hit the gym and taken every health potion they can find. BadCheese31 ruffled a few feathers by posting about a specific encounter where a foe just wouldn’t go down, no matter how hard they pummeled it with cannon fire. “How can it heal faster than six ships shooting at it?” they lamented. It’s like trying to sink the Titanic with just water balloons. The mechanics have players feeling like they’re just shooting blanks, with the NPCs soaking up all their damage. The player’s frustration is palpable, as they argue that while a challenge is welcome, this is akin to being stranded on a deserted island with only bananas and no coconuts.\nWhat truly gets players riled up isn’t just the health factor—it’s the feels like cheating aspect of the situation. In a game where teamwork and strategy should reign, the apparent imbalance raises questions about the design choices made by the developers. If players are to feel as strong, brave, and legendary as the pirate personas they embody, then battles against NPCs should also reflect that power fantasy.\nAiding the Cause: Repair Ships?\nA recurring theme in the comment section deals with repair ships, which several players suggest should be targeted first in battle. “You have to kill the repair ships. Those should be your first priority,” suggests one commenter, revealing the necessity of strategic planning. Others back this sentiment, insisting that players need to engage their “brain cells” if they want to stand a chance in this digital pirateland.\nThe crowd’s suggestions hint that this could be more about tactics than outright game imbalances. One user noted, “Ship probably had the shell shocked heal,” referencing a specific perk that allows certain ships to heal whenever they fire their weapons. With players discovering these hidden mechanics, the narrative starts to shift from a simple complaint to a call for adaptability. It turns the scenario into a chess game; one where ignoring important pieces leads to swift defeat.\nThe Healing Heavies Debate\nAs the conversation deepens, opinions vary wildly, with some players adamantly declaring, “Git Gud. Your on world rank 2 it’s supposed to be very hard.” The notion that difficulty is a fundamental part of the experience is supported by a faction that relishes the challenge, brushing off the cries for help as just a part of the pirating experience. After all, isn’t overcoming obstacles what makes piracy so appealing?\nYet, while challenging gameplay is appreciated, the key lies in balance. Players desire an experience that pushes them to their limits without leading to frustration. Having NPC ships that feel invincible—especially those that can continually heal—leaves many players feeling like they are in a blender of chaos, where the satisfaction of victory starts to feel like a cruel joke rather than a triumphant achievement.\nCommunity-Sourced Strategies\nWhile some players express their frustrations, the community also comes together to provide tips and strategies. “Kill the repair ship first. This is not WT1… you have to use some brain cells,” advises a user going by Quiet_Beyond_1657. This advice has sparked a whole new wave of discussions around tactics in engaging with tougher NPCs.\nIn fact, there appear to be a few lightbulb moments for players who, amid their vexation, have slowly started to piece together methods for overcoming their digital foes. Suggestions about formations, targeting order, and even specific weapons have turned the comment section into a brainstorming session that gives credence to the notion that there’s still a glimmer of hope.\nWhat’s particularly amusing is how, even in a melting pot of complaints, there’s an undeniable spirit of camaraderie. Players are supporting one another, sharing tales of legendary crashes and ridiculous ship designs all while rallying their fellow pirates to rise against these monstrous NPC ships. It’s like a pirate club; a wacky, digital version of Moby Dick, where the whale is actually made up of various NPC ships that seem like they’re defying the laws of physics.\nAs Skull and Bones players band together to navigate through these turbulent waters, their experience encapsulates a critical junction in gaming community culture. It’s not just about bemoaning the obstacles—they’re also collaborating, strategizing, and learning in the process. The variety of perspectives showcases an engaging mix of protection, learning, and, let’s not forget, a dash of humor that resonates throughout.\nWhether this penchant for balance adjustment or skill mastering will lead to a smoother sailing experience in the future remains to be seen. For now, players are maintaining their pirate pride, tackling NPC foes, and laughing through the struggle, proving once more that even the most frustrating game experiences can bring about a swashbuckling sense of community.",

    "text": "As the old saying goes, the kids are alright. But that phrase doesn't do one particularly precocious golfer justice.\nIf you've followed the junior golf circuit over the past couple years at all, you've probably heard the name Miles Russell. If you haven't, this is name golf fans might want to learn. Quickly.\nRELATED: Just how good is Charlie Woods?\nThat's because Miles is not your normal 15-year-old. He's the reigning AJGA Player of the Year. He signed an NIL deal with Transcend Capital Advisors last fall. And on Thursday, he put forth a pretty darn special debut on the Korn Ferry Tour.\nPlaying in the LECOM Suncoast Classic , Russell shot a front-nine 31 to place himself among the early leaders at Lakewood National Golf Club in Lakewood Ranch, Florida. That's right, the 15-year-old needed only 31 strokes to complete his opening nine holes in his first PGA Tour-sanctioned event.\nRELATED: This Korn Ferry Tour first-tee announcer is worth the price of admission\nRussell cooled off on the back nine with a 37, but the lefty still recorded a three-under-par 68. He's currently four shots behind a group at seven under.\nThen again, we shouldn't be too surprised. Not only did he win the Junior Players Championship last year, but he also shot a second-round 66 at TPC Sawgrass. And he won the Junior PGA Championship by seven shots before playing in the Junior Ryder Cup in September.\nStill, doing it against adult tour pros is different.\nRELATED: Golf's all-time biggest phenoms\n“I don’t know what to expect, but I’d love to make the cut and who knows, maybe have a good weekend and see where it puts me,” Russell told PGATour.com on Tuesday.\nGood start, young man. Good start.\nRELATED: Why the world's top-ranked amateur is staying in school",

    "text": "A freak weather event which tore through a Wexford house 'like a train' has left sheet metal and debris scattered across fields and ditches up to a kilometre away.\nA severe wind during Storm Gerrit which locals in the village of Duncormick in South Wexford described as being like a tornado, ripped through the home in the early hours of Thursday morning.\nLocal Aontu Cllr. Jim Codd, was at the scene at first light and said the damage caused was 'colossal'.\nREAD MORE:\nIreland New Year’s weather misery as Met Eireann issues multiple warnings for fierce double blast\n'I can only think it was a tornado because it came after the winds which raged all night and only one house was hit,' he said.\n'It's quite astonishing to see the amount of damage done to the house, the family described it to me as 'like a train went through the house'.\n'As I drove up here I saw sheets of metal lying in the ditches half a mile away from the property, there was debris scattered across the fields,' he added.\n'Thankfully despite part of the roof being blown off, the family were unhurt by the storm and are focused on repairing the damage as best they can lest further adverse weather hit South Wexford.\n'While a tarpaulin has been erected to cover the holes in the roof, the sheds and buildings in the back yard have been 'completely flattened' with parts of them unlikely to ever be recovered,' he said.\nRemarkably, the house in Woodgraigue, Duncormick, was the only one impacted by the weather event, with neighbouring properties escaping completely unscathed.\n'No other house in the area was touched, the one across the road, not 300 metres away, avoided it completely,' confirmed Cllr. Codd.\nA\nGoFundMe page has been set up to help with the associated costs of repairing the house.\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click\nthis link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.
