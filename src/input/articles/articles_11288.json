    "text": "Waste is an inherent outcome of life on Earth and the functioning of human economies. Over time, living systems have adapted to transform waste, with organisms such as dung beetles playing a crucial role in decomposing the feces of other species. However, managing waste continues to be a significant challenge within human societies. As the world population continues to grow and rapidly urbanize — two-thirds of humans will be city dwellers by 2050, according to the United Nations — our waste is driving a mounting worldwide crisis. Microplastics blanket the planet and infiltrate our bodies, wastewater pollutes our waterways, and greenhouse gas emissions are driving global climate change. “We as a society tend to ignore the unpleasant side of our production,” says Mingzhen Lu, an Assistant Professor at New York University and former SFI Omidyar Complexity Fellow. Lu and SFI Professor Chris Kempes are co-corresponding authors on a new paper published in Nature Cities that explores waste production as a function of urban systems. Findings and Implications for Urban Planning “The key question is whether waste is produced more or less efficiently as systems scale up, and how big a recycling burden there is as a consequence,” says Kempes. To address this question, the authors used scaling theory to analyze waste products — municipal solid waste, wastewater, and greenhouse gas emissions — from more than one thousand cities around the world. Scaling theory has been used in biology to describe how organism physiology changes with body mass, and it proved relevant for understanding how waste production scales with the growth of a city. “Scaling theory allowed us to extract overarching broad stroke patterns and transcend the individuality of each city,” explains Lu. The resulting patterns show distinct differences in waste production as cities grow. Solid waste scales linearly — because it is tied to individual consumption, it increases at the same rate as population growth. In contrast, wastewater production scales superlinearly while emissions scale sub-linearly. In other words, bigger cities contribute disproportionately more liquid waste than smaller cities, but expel fewer greenhouse gasses. The results suggest an economy of scale for emissions as growth typically brings more efficient energy and transportation infrastructure, but a diseconomy for liquid waste. Cities tend to deviate from the universal scaling law as they grow wealthier. Cities with higher per-capita GDP generate more waste across the board, which underscores the relationship between waste generation and economic growth. Towards a New Science of Waste The findings emphasize the need for a new science of waste that can help predict the future state of urban ecosystems and inform policies to reduce waste and enhance sustainability. “Fungi figured out how to decompose lignin waste from trees and created sustainable ecosystems that have lasted hundreds of million years,” says Lu. “We take it in and throw it away — we can no longer overlook waste from our societies.” Reference: “Worldwide scaling of waste generation in urban systems” by Mingzhen Lu, Chuanbin Zhou, Chenghao Wang, Robert B.

    "text": "Early spring snowfall and hazardous road conditions are expected across the lower peninsula Friday A late winter snowstorm is making its way towards the mid Michigan region bringing heavy snow with it, and a winter weather advisory is place for most of the lower peninsula starting Friday. According to the National Weather Service in Grand Rapids, a low pressure system is moving through the southern Great Lakes across Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Snow accumulation of three to seven inches is expected with highest snowfalls totals occurring near and north of I-96. “In the Lansing area probably four inches or so,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Walt Felver. “A little bit more as you go farther north toward Alma.” Travel throughout the day on Friday will be difficult with hazardous conditions impacting the morning and evening commute. “Worst thing you can ever do is be panicked in a snowstorm because you're running late,” said Felver. “That's when accidents occur, so people need to be alert. We haven't had snow in a while, and so winter is not over yet.” Snow covered and slippery roads will be likely at times as temperatures will be near and below freezing during the snow fall. “So it's going to be a plowable snow. Its going to be sloppy, it's going to be slippery, but we're not expecting any freezing rain,” Felver said. Felver predicts Friday's highs in the low to mid thirties, with wind chill around 20 degrees.

There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\nEthereum price is now trading above $3,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $3,880 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,920 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,940 level. A clear move above the $3,940 resistance might send the price toward the $3,980 resistance.\nAn upside break above the $3,980 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,050 resistance zone or even $4,120 in the near term.\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,880 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level. The first major support sits near the $3,720 zone.\nA clear move below the $3,720 support might push the price toward the $3,680 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,565 support level in the near term.

    "text": "Jay Slater fundraiser passes £30,000 target as Tenerife search goes on Mr Slater, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, disappeared following an attempt to walk back to his accommodation after missing a bus. A fundraiser set up by the last person to speak to Jay Slater, the British teenager who went missing during a holiday in Tenerife, has hit its target of £30,000. The GoFundMe created by Lucy Law to “get Jay Slater home” had received £31,721 in donations by Sunday evening. The page was set up by Mr Slater’s friend three days ago and a post below, which claims to be from Mr Slater’s mother Debbie Duncan, confirmed it was “approved by our family”. The post said: “We have not yet withdrawn any funds and are currently covering the expenses, such as the trip to Tenerife and accommodation, ourselves. The funds will remain on hold with GoFundMe until we post a further update on this page.” Mr Slater, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, disappeared following an attempt to walk back to his accommodation after missing a bus. He had attended the NRG music festival on the island with two friends before his disappearance. Ms Law, who went to the festival with Mr Slater, said he called her at about 8.30am on Monday and told her he was “lost in the mountains, he wasn’t aware of his surroundings, he desperately needed a drink and his phone was on 1%”. Ms Duncan, who flew to Tenerife on Tuesday, said searching for her son was “an absolute living nightmare”. Ms Duncan told ITV News: “He’s the life and soul, he’s a beautiful boy.” Mr Slater was last seen wearing a white T-shirt with shorts and trainers, and carrying a black bag. Search teams have narrowed their efforts on small buildings close to where his phone last pinged in Tenerife. Officers from the Guardia Civil in the Canary Islands could be seen circling two structures at the bottom of a ravine in Rural de Teno Park on Sunday. Efforts appeared to be solely focused on the one area after days of searches in the village of Masca and the surrounding landscape. Those conducting the searches on the seventh day of the hunt for Mr Slater could be seen looking into blue barrels outside one of the small buildings. The efforts come after the teenager’s mother issued a direct plea to her missing son, saying: “We just need you home.” Ms Duncan told the PA news agency she has “not slept” since the 19-year-old disappeared. She said she did not know whether the Spanish authorities turning down an offer of help from the UK was because they viewed it as “an insult”. Asked how the family was coping with the situation, Ms Duncan said: “We’re not. I’m not coping very well at all. “I’ve not slept, I’m exhausted. It’s been awful. “I can’t give up on him, I just can’t.”",
