    "title": "Christianity used in sorcery accusations - POST-COURIER",
    "text": "Sorcery accusations in 2023 rose to an all-time high as 400 people were accused of sorcery with religion now used to raise accusations against others.\nAnd from the 400 about 65 people accused of sorcery were killed.\nThe statistics were presented by the Parliamentary Committee on Gender Based Violence Chairman Powes Parkop to parliament early this year.\nThe data was collected from an Inquiry conducted by the Committee.\nHowever, among all the accusations, the tortures, the videos, and the pictures, the churches have now been pulled into the sinister world of Sorcery with some of the accusers quoting scriptures and accusing women and the vulnerable as those practicing witchcraft.\nAnd one of the cases covered extensively by the Post-Courier was the story of mother of five Lorna Nico.\nNico was a woman from Sohe, Northern Province who fell in love with a man from Mumeng, Morobe province, left her family behind and started a family with her husband and his people.\nThey were happy until the end of August of this year.\nAs her 8-year-old watched, Lorna was stripped and tortured dying of her injuries and then her body left out to the elements of the sun and insects until the evening when her body was removed and buried.\nShe was identified after a ‘prayer warrior” from one of the churches accused her of having satanic powers and bringing bad luck to the community.\nLorna didn’t know this woman nor was she part of the church the woman was from.\nHowever, she was pointed out allegedly because she was from another province.\nBishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church Reverand Jack Urame spoke about the dangers\nof “mixing religion and sorcery”.\n“This is not what the bible taught us, there is a shift in people using Christianity to identify suspected sorcerers which was now being used to destroy families and commit murders.”\nUsing Christianity as a means to enact killings against those accused of sorcery is an idea condemned by the churches,” he further stated.\nBut the voice of a leader of a church is worrying because PNG has been declared by the government as a Christian nation.\nAs a nation much is still needed to be done in terms of ridding accusations of sorcery and killings associated with sorcery.\nIn the city of Port Moresby, a man who had cancer recently died with his family accusing a relative of causing his mouth cancer by giving him betelnut that was tainted.\nThis result in the burning of homes and the assault of one man who was only a neighbor to\nthe accused.\nSpeaking to those who live in the community it was surprising that the support was given to the relatives of the deceased.\nNot even the church was spared, as the deceased relatives accused the church of interfering in a matter, they knew nothing off.\nChristianity continues to be the belief across the country but when it becomes part of the sorcery accusations, police are worried with the rise in such accusations using the church.\nPolice Commissioner David Manning said; “It is sickening to see these profiteers of death now calling themselves prayer warriors, misusing mainstream Christian faith for their brutal and bloody ends.\n“One of the most effective ways of preventing these sorcery crimes is through police working with community leaders and churches.”’\n“Glasman or glasmeris” used their connections to churches to accuse those they believed were practicing witchcraft.\n“Police are targeting glasmen, glasmeris and prayer warriors, and stopping these criminals is an important part of law enforcement relating to sorcery.”\nPolice are working with churches and community groups to provide more effective safe houses once survivors and their families escape or are rescued, he added.\nFor now, more needs to be done in the fight against sorcery.",

    "text": "Marisela Santibáñez valoró esta tarde la decisión de Azul Azul, de desvincular inmediatamente de Universidad de Chile a su arquero Cristóbal Campos, denunciado esta semana por su expareja de violencia intrafamiliar (VIF).\nEl anuncio del cuadro laico se hizo efectivo este miércoles, en un escueto comunicado en sus plataformas digitales donde se aclaró que el término de la relación contractual con el jugador, que tenía vigencia por un año más, había llegado luego de “una evaluación general del Club”.\nEl recado de Santibáñez a Colo Colo “El Club Universidad de Chile informa que el jugador Cristóbal Campos Véliz no continuará formando parte de nuestra institución. Según lo conversado con el futbolista de 24 años, y tras una evaluación general del Club, se definió, en conocimiento de ambas partes, poner término al vínculo contractual que lo ligaba con la institución hasta fines de 2024″, señaló la concesionaria, declaración que la diputada comunista celebró en sus cuentas oficiales de Instagram y la red social X, ya que a su juicio, la institución deportiva “por fin está entendiendo” la gravedad de la violencia en contra de las mujeres.\n“Porque la nobleza obliga, hoy destacamos a Universidad de Chile. Como colocolina me defino ‘de sangre altiva y noble corazón’. Que se haya desvinculado a su exarquero, investigado por violencia intrafamiliar (VIF), da cuenta que por fin están entendiendo”, escribió la parlamentaria, quien en su publicación no dejó pasar el hecho para comparar la reacción de los universitarios con la de Colo Colo, que en el caso de la denuncia por femicidio frustrado en contra de Jordhy Thompson optaron por mantener al jugador en su institución, pese a que la víctima -su expareja- lo acusó en reiteradas oportunidades de haberla agredido física y psicológicamente.\n“Señores de ByN ¡No es necesario ir a la universidad para entender el respeto por las leyes! #DeporteSinAbusos”, concluyó.\nFuente: TwitterX @mariseka.\nFuente: Instagram @mariseka.",

    "text": "Essential Items for Your Go Bag In the face of unexpected events, preparedness is key. Having a go bag, also known as an emergency kit, can make all the difference in navigating challenging situations. Whether it’s a natural disaster, a power outage, or an unforeseen emergency, a well-stocked go bag provides essential supplies to ensure your safety and well-being. Why is a Go Bag Important? A go bag serves as a lifeline in times of crisis. It allows you to evacuate quickly and efficiently, carrying vital items that may not be readily available during an emergency. Imagine a scenario where you have to leave your home abruptly due to a wildfire or a sudden flood. A go bag ensures you have access to critical necessities like food, water, first-aid supplies, and essential documents, minimizing the impact of the situation. Essential Items for Your Go Bag Here’s a comprehensive list of essential items to include in your go bag: Basic Needs - Water: Pack at least one gallon of water per person per day for a minimum of three days. Consider using water purification tablets or a filter to extend your water supply. - Food: Include non-perishable food items that require no cooking, such as canned goods, energy bars, nuts, and dried fruit. Opt for food with a long shelf life. - First-Aid Kit: Assemble a basic first-aid kit with essential supplies like bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and antibiotic cream. Customize it based on your specific needs and medical conditions. - Shelter: Pack a lightweight tarp, sleeping bag, or blanket for temporary shelter. Consider a portable camping tent if space permits. - Clothing: Include warm and comfortable clothing suitable for various weather conditions. Pack a change of clothes, socks, and a hat. Safety and Communication - Flashlight and Batteries: Ensure you have a reliable flashlight and extra batteries. Consider a multi-purpose flashlight that doubles as a radio or a power bank. - Whistle: A whistle can be used to signal for help in case of an emergency. - Emergency Radio: A weather radio can provide updates on emergency situations and warnings. Choose a radio that operates on multiple frequencies, including AM, FM, and NOAA Weather Radio. - Cell Phone Charger: Pack a portable phone charger to keep your phone operational. Consider a solar charger for extended power. Personal Items and Documents - Identification: Carry copies of your driver’s license, passport, and any other essential identification documents. Store these documents in a waterproof bag or container. - Cash: Keep a small amount of cash on hand, as ATMs may be unavailable during an emergency. - Medications: Pack a list of your medications, dosages, and any allergies. Include a supply of your essential medications in a clearly labeled container. - Important Documents: Keep copies of important documents, such as insurance policies, medical records, and financial statements, in a waterproof bag. Tips for Organizing Your Go Bag - Choose the Right Bag: Select a durable and waterproof backpack or duffel bag that’s comfortable to carry and has enough space for your supplies. - Organize and Label: Pack your items in waterproof bags or containers and label them clearly. This helps you locate items quickly in an emergency. - Practice and Rotate: Regularly practice packing and unpacking your go bag to ensure you’re familiar with its contents. Rotate food and water supplies every six months to maintain freshness. - Store in an Accessible Location: Keep your go bag in a designated location that’s easily accessible in case of an emergency. Preparing a go bag is an essential step in ensuring your safety and well-being during unforeseen events. By following these guidelines and including the necessary items, you’ll be better equipped to face challenges and navigate difficult situations with confidence.",

    "text": "A website bearing the old Enron logo introduced the fictitious device, touting it as the future of home energy under the tagline “Nuclear you can trust.” Source : Enron If you are a tech enthusiast and keep checking out posts from bloggers, reviewers, and publications on the topic, chances are that you must have already come across posts on \"Enron Egg,\" a supposed micro nuclear reactor designed to power homes for a decade. However, before you ditch your electricity provider, there's a catch — it’s entirely fake.\nThis parody product was created by a mock version of Enron, the infamous energy company that collapsed in a historic accounting scandal in 2001.\nMeet The Enron Egg, the world’s first at-home nuclear reactor. Watch the historic reveal. pic.twitter.com/VUHbuuBwjA\n— Enron (@Enron) January 6, 2025\nNuclear You Can Trust? A website bearing the old Enron logo introduced the fictitious device, touting it as the future of home energy under the tagline “Nuclear you can trust.” The satirical product description highlighted features like a heat-resistant casing to ensure durability and safety, as well as an integrated chip for 24/7 monitoring by a \"nuclear management facility.\"\nAdding to the parody, a launch video showcased fake company executives hyping the egg-shaped reactor on stage, complete with dramatic visuals and an enthusiastic faux audience. One supposed testimonial came from Connor Gaydos, co-author of Birds Aren’t Real, who jokingly claimed, “I’ve been living with an Egg for a few months now, and let me just tell you that my little ones, they freakin’ love it, especially when what we save on the energy bill we can spend on Christmas presents.”\nNetizens Participate Social media users were quick to embrace the humour.\nThe gentleman during the product knowledge event was amazing, and had an oddly familiar look! Great conference. Would love to attend the next one.\n— Stockstradamos (@_cannafit_) January 6, 2025\n@ShawnRyan762 looks like nuclear fusion does exist\n— Cristina B (@HandleThisLater) January 6, 2025\nAfter playing through multiple fallout games, I don’t know if this is such a good idea fam 😄\n— Mike (@Cefu_0804) January 7, 2025\nA Nod To Enron’s Troubled History The parody is a tongue-in-cheek nod to Enron’s infamous downfall, which wiped out over $60 billion in assets and led to major financial regulations. The company’s fraudulent practices became a symbol of corporate greed and mismanagement.\nWhile the Enron Egg may be a spoof, nuclear power is a hot topic in the tech world, with companies exploring it as a solution to growing energy demands. However, real-world adoption still faces challenges such as high costs, regulatory hurdles, and concerns over nuclear safety.\nFor those who missed the joke, the Enron.com site includes disclaimers describing the content as “represents performance art and is for entertainment purposes only,” reported Forbes. Even the site’s playful acrostic poem hints at its satirical nature, assigning ironic adjectives like \"repentant\" and \"nice\" to Enron’s name.\nIn the end, the Enron Egg stands as a clever commentary on both corporate scandals and the gullibility of the internet age, reminding us to double-check before taking any viral sensation at face value.",

    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. ( KKTV /Gray News) - A retired Marine and cancer survivor in Colorado celebrates the anniversary of his remission with a feat he picked up during his service. Michael LaBarge said he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV brain cancer, 21 years ago on April 2. LaBarge said he has been in remission for a while and that he swims for 10 hours on the anniversary to celebrate it. “The prognosis was two weeks to 10 months … 21 years ago,” he told KKTV . “I did this a lot in the Marines. [Today,] I started at 6 a.m., stopping at 4 p.m.” He completed his swim this year at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Community Pool in Colorado Springs. Chris Gesterling, the USAFA Pool Aquatics Manager, said he often sees LaBarge at the pool, and his story of surviving cancer is inspiring. “Former Marine ... you know, he beat brain cancer so everything is possible for him,” Gesterling said. As LaBarge swam, he also shared his message for those fighting similar battles to the one he faced. “Hopefully, this will inspire people with cancer to get out, stay active and, you know, don’t get too down on themselves,” he said.

    "text": "Es la primera vez en la historia de\nEstados Unidos que el hijo de un mandatario activo se enfrenta a un juicio que, en este caso, puede afectar a la campaña de Joe Biden en las presidenciales del 5 de noviembre.\nEl presidente estadounidense,\nhttps://rpp.pe/mundo/europa/joe-biden-presidente-de-eeuu-se-hace-viral-por-inusual-gesto-en-ceremonia-oficial-noticia-1560028, descartó este viernes indultar a su hijo Hunter en caso de que este llegue a ser condenado en el juicio iniciado esta semana por compra y posesión ilegal de un arma en 2018.\nEn una entrevista concedida a ABC News, el mandatario afirmó con un escueto \"sí\" que respetará el veredicto.\nEs la primera vez en la historia de\nEstados Unidos que el hijo de un mandatario en activo se enfrenta a un juicio que, en este caso, puede afectar a la campaña de Joe Biden en las presidenciales del 5 de noviembre ya que los republicanos, especialmente el expresidente Donald Trump (2017-2021), lo utilizan con frecuencia como arma arrojadiza en su contra.\nHunter Biden es hijo de la primera esposa del presidente, la fallecida Neilia Biden, y está acusado de mentir en octubre de 2018 cuando no reconoció que consumía drogas en un formulario para comprar un revólver Colt Cobra de calibre 38, que luego guardó durante 11 días.\nEl proceso comenzó el lunes en Wilmington (Delaware) y después de que este miércoles declararan su exesposa, Kathleen Buhle, y una exnovia, Zoe Kestan, este jueves se sentó en el banquillo Hallie Biden, viuda de su hermano Beau Biden, fallecido de cáncer en 2015, y con quien Hunter tuvo una relación extramarital tras el fallecimiento de Beau.\nHijo de Joe Biden se defiende\nHallie Biden dijo haberse asustado cuando encontró la pistola en el coche de Hunter y admitió haber empezado a consumir crack de cocaína después de que este la introdujera a esa droga: \"Fue una experiencia terrible de la que me avergüenzo. Lamento ese periodo de mi vida\", señaló.\nSin embargo, señaló no haberle visto consumir drogas en la época en la que compró y tuvo el arma en cuestión.\nhttps://rpp.pe/mundo/estados-unidos/joe-biden-firma-orden-ejecutiva-que-limita-solicitudes-de-asilo-en-frontera-de-eeuu-noticia-1559441 no ha acudido a la corte, pero el lunes, cuando se seleccionó el jurado, sí estuvo presente la primera dama, Jill Biden, que justo ese día cumplió 73 años.\nEn un comunicado, no obstante, el mandatario demócrata apuntó que como presidente no iba a hacer ningún comentario sobre casos federales pendientes, pero que como padre tenía un \"amor ilimitado\" por su hijo, \"confianza en él y respeto por su fuerza\".\nLos tres cargos que se le imputan a Hunter Biden por la compra y posesión ilegal de un arma al haber mentido sobre su adicción conllevan una pena máxima de 25 años de cárcel, si bien las sentencias suelen ser menores para quienes, como él, carecen de antecedentes penales.\nEFE\nTe recomendamos\nComparte esta noticia",

    "text": "Internal marks row: CUK drops dean from redressal panel after HC flags conflict of interest\nMail This Article\nKasaragod: The Central University of Kerala (CUK) has reconstituted its Student Grievance Redressal Committee, removing Prof Joseph Koyipally, after the Kerala High Court questioned how he could sit in judgment in a complaint filed against him.\nThe new Grievance Redressal Committee, reconstituted on June 20, has six members, including a student representative, and is headed by Prof Arun Kumar K of the Department of Plant Science.\nThe move came in compliance with the court's interim direction to the Vice Chancellor issued on June 9, in a writ petition filed by Nayanthara Thilak, a postgraduate student (2022–2024 batch) from the Department of English and Comparative Literature.\nA year ago, on July 27, 2024, Thilak wrote to the Student Grievance Redressal Committee that her internal marks were unfairly reduced by Prof Koyipally and Dr Asha S, an associate professor and Head of the Department, after she attended a prestigious academic programme at Cornell University.\nBut soon after she filed the complaint, the then vice-chancellor in charge, Prof Vincent Mathew, reconstituted the Redressal Committee and included Prof Koyipally in it.\nProf Koyipally is the dean of the School of Languages and Comparative Literature, and has frequently stood in as the acting Vice-Chancellor during Prof Mathew’s absence, a role that underscored his prominence within the university's hierarchy.\nAccording to her legal team, the Grievance Redressal Committee never took up her complaint, forcing her to approach the High Court.\nOn June 9, 2025, High Court judge D K Singh directed the new Vice Chancellor, Professor Siddu P Algur, to \"reconstitute the redressal cell in which the fifth respondent (Prof Koyipally) should not be associated at all...\" The interim order further directed the Grievance Redressal Committee to hear both Prof Koyipally and the student before submitting its report.\nThe court will hear the case next on July 8.\nThilak, a topper in class, alleged that her internal marks were deliberately manipulated to prevent her from securing the top rank in her class.\nOn March 8, during CUK's eighth convocation, the first-rank holders of 26 of the university’s 27 departments were honoured. However, the Department of English and Comparative Literature did not announce its topper. Controller of Examinations Dr Jayaprakash R confirmed that the department’s rank list had been withheld because of the court’s interim order on March 7 in Thilak’s case.\nAccording to the writ petition, faculty members Prof Koyipally and Dr Asha, the Head of the Department, awarded Thilak 49 out of 60 internal marks in English Language and Linguistics, the lowest in her class. This came after she attended a six-week Critical Theory Summer School at Cornell University, from June 9 to July 18, 2024, for which she had secured prior written permission from the university.\nThilak, a native of Kozhikode and a three-time class topper, alleged that her low marks were a form of academic retaliation. She noted that the 49 marks she received were the same as those awarded to a student who had been on maternity leave for several months, calling it \"sufficient evidence of bias\".",
