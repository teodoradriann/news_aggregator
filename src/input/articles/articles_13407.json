    "text": "The family of a five-year-old girl who was [stabbed outside her school last month](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41296315.html) has confirmed she is “out of danger”. The primary school pupil was one of three children who were injured during the [incident on November 23 outside Gaelscoil Coláiste Mhuire](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41276098.html) on Parnell Square in Dublin. While the other two children, a boy, 5, and girl, 6, were [discharged from hospital within days of the incident](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41277100.html), the five-year-old girl was in a critical condition and in intensive care at Temple Street Children’s hospital until recently. In an update on a GoFundMe page for the child today, her family shared the news that she is slowly recovering. Organiser and family friend Roisin Fitzgerald posted the message on behalf of the child’s parents. It reads: “Just to wish everyone a delayed Christmas and a happy new year. “Our angel has been out of the PICU for two weeks now. Creche worker Leanne Flynn was also injured in the incident and she remains in the Mater Hospital. Meanwhile, the man accused of the attempted murder of the little girl and two other children was further remanded in custody until January 25 when he appeared before Cloverhill District Court via video link on Thursday morning. [Riad Bouchaker](https://www.irishexaminer.com/nationalnews/arid-41295277.html), of no fixed abode, also faces charges of causing serious harm to a care worker, the assault of a French man at the scene, and with assault causing harm to other children. The GoFundMe for the little girl has so far raised almost €55,000.",

    "title": "Why Old Attack Methods Still Compromise Modern Infrastructure",
    "text": "A recent wave of high-profile cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure and major enterprises serves as a stark reminder of how adversaries, including sophisticated nation-state actors, sustain a continual foothold within their targets’ networks.\nUpon closer inspection, the methods used to infiltrate these organisations are rarely novel. Instead, attackers persistently rely on proven, effective tactics, targeting low-hanging fruit like known critical vulnerabilities, overprivileged access, and publicly exposed secrets. Like moths to a flame, bad actors are drawn to these secrets such as hardcoded API keys as they provide the most direct path to move laterally, escalate privileges, and access an organisation's most valuable assets. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors take this a step further, creating hidden backdoors to exfiltrate data over long periods without detection.\nThis challenge is compounded by the rapid pace of technological innovation. As the shift to cloud computing accelerates, the number of assets, applications, and identities expands, creating new vulnerabilities and misconfigurations for attackers to exploit. They use automated tools to scan public repositories like GitHub, misconfigured cloud storage, and web applications for exposed secrets, turning a simple oversight into an unintentional breach. This problem is widespread; currently, one in 10 organisations has storage resources containing sensitive data that could be at risk if exposed.\nTo counter these persistent threats, a fundamental shift in mindset is required, moving from simply managing vulnerabilities to proactively managing cyber exposure. While crucial, vulnerability management is only one piece of the puzzle and is not sufficient to tackle the threats emerging from APTs and other determined adversaries. A preventive approach is necessary to curb the risk posed by these actors.\nThis is where proactive exposure management becomes essential. It provides a holistic view of the entire attack surface, from on-premises systems to the cloud, allowing organisations to understand and prioritise risk in a way that traditional approaches cannot. By mapping the complex relationships between assets, identities, and their inherent risks, exposure management platforms can identify and prioritise potential attack paths before they are exploited. This unified visibility becomes paramount as adversaries probe for the single weakest link and is critical for outmanoeuvring the acceleration of attacks in the modern era.\nUltimately, organisations must embed this proactive strategy into their daily operations. This includes continuously identifying where sensitive data resides and implementing robust controls like just-in-time access, multi-factor authentication, and the principle of least privilege to ensure secrets are accessible only by those who need them.\nGiven the increase in cyberattacks, a reactive security posture is unsustainable. Organisations must anticipate these threats by proactively understanding their full exposure, focusing their defences where they matter most, and closing the gaps that attackers have proven they will exploit.\nSatnam Narang, Sr. Staff Research Engineer at Tenable",

    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — It's been anything but a white winter in the Twin Cities so far this season, but with the upcoming snow forecast for this weekend, some cities could declare snow emergencies. To spare you the cost of a ticket and a tow, we offer a reminder of what to do in the metro when your city declares a snow emergency.\n- Day 1: Don't park on either side of a snow emergency route until 8 a.m., or until the street is fully plowed.\n- Day 2: Don't park on the even numbered side of a non-snow emergency route until 8 p.m., or until that side of the street is fully plowed. Additionally, don't park on either side of a parkway until 8 p.m., or until the parkway is fully plowed.\n- Day 3: Don't park on the odd numbered side of a non-snow emergency route until 8 p.m., or until that side of the street is fully plowed.\n- Beginning at 9 p.m., all night plow routes will be plowed. Don't park on night plow routes, which include all of downtown and streets with signs reading \"NIGHT PLOW ROUTE\" or \"NIGHT PLOW ROUTE THIS SIDE OF STREET.\"\n- Beginning at 8 a.m., all day plow routes will be plowed. Don't park on these routes. They aren't marked by signs — if a street doesn't have any night plow signs and isn't downtown, the city said you should consider it a day plow route.\nSeveral other metro-area cities also have policies for snow emergencies.

    "title": "Harris Proves She’s Not Hostile to Israel by Appointing Liaison to Jews Who Hates Israel – PJ Media",
    "text": "Kamala Harris, as excited as the left is pretending to be about her these days, faces a number of problems on the gilded pathway to the Oval Office that the establishment media wants us to believe she is traveling. Not least among them is the fact that she is widely perceived, and with good reason, as being unjustifiably hostile to Israel, not just in pursuit of Muslim votes, but out of the collectivist left’s blazing hatred of a state so rooted in particularity as the lone free society in the Middle East. To counter that impression, Harris has just appointed a campaign liaison to the Jewish community. There’s just one catch: he hates Israel, too.\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported Tuesday that Harris’ new token, er, liaison, Ilan Goldenberg, “has longstanding ties to the anti-Israel group J Street and served as a foreign policy adviser to Elizabeth Warren’s failed 2020 presidential bid. Throughout his professional career, both in and out of government, he has served as a public defender of the Democratic party’s criticisms of Israel, a critic of the GOP’s efforts to strengthen ties with the Jewish state, and a proponent of deepening diplomatic relations with Iran.” All that certainly explains why Harris picked him, but Goldenberg is actually much worse than a garden-variety leftist critic of the Jewish state.\nGoldenberg, in fact, advocated for a policy that led directly to the Hamas massacre of 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, as he had urged Israel to bring in large numbers of workers from Gaza — the very workers who observed carefully the areas where they worked and provided Hamas with the details it needed to carry out the Oct. 7 attacks.\n“You used to have 25,000, 100,000 Gazans working inside Israel,” Goldenberg noted and continued, “That needs to happen again. The Israelis know who these guys are. They can start with a few thousand work permits. And there’s a lot of support for that in all of the Israeli communities around Gaza.”\nInvestigative journalist Daniel Greenfield points out that this was one time when an analyst’s policies were fully adopted, so their actual results are clear: “That became policy. Gazans flooded Israel, scouted those ‘Israeli communities around Gaza’ and when Oct 7 began, they came back with maps of the communities so that they knew where the security teams were, which houses had dogs, and where the children could be found.”\n As if that weren’t bad enough, Greenfield states that Goldenberg has also proposed that “the United States, UNSCO [the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process], and Egypt should work quietly in concert, engaging with Israel, the PA, Hamas and a ‘long-term ceasefire’ between Israel and Hamas, with Israel accepting that 'Hamas would retain some of its military capabilities.’” The world saw what Hamas’ retaining of some of its military capabilities meant on Oct. 7. That’s why Israel has vowed repeatedly to destroy it utterly, even over the strenuous resistance of the Biden-Harris regime.\n Related: The Latest Biden-Harris Betrayal of Israel Will Make Your Blood Run Cold\nNone of these statements from Goldenberg or others like them are likely to trouble Harris. She said several weeks ago that pro-Hamas campus demonstrators \"are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza.\" She has claimed that Israel is responsible for a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza, ignoring the fact that Hamas has actually stolen the bulk of the aid that has been delivered there.\nOn Saturday, when Israel took out 31 jihadis in a Hamas command room that was hidden inside a mosque at a school complex, Harris intoned : “Yet again, far too many civilians have been killed.” Yet again, the only source for the claim that any civilians had been killed at all was Hamas, which was been repeatedly caught inflating its casualty figures in order to turn world opinion against Israel.\nWhy would Harris so credulously accept Hamas’ word? Because what Hamas says about Israel fits in with her worldview. She has no time for fairness or any kind of intellectual curiosity; her days are full enough lately with the pursuit of raw power.\nAnyone who is familiar with Ilan Goldenberg’s record will see his appointment as Harris’ liaison to the Jewish community not as an olive branch from the anointed candidate but as just another insult. There will be many more.",

    "text": "El ICUAP diseña biomaterial capaz de estimular la regeneración de tejido óseo\n- Induce el crecimiento celular a las primeras 24 horas en contacto con fibroblastos\nLas fracturas son un problema de salud pública en México, principalmente en adultos mayores. En 2022, el Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social realizó más de 10 mil cirugías por fractura de cadera en personas mayores de 65 años que sufren de osteoporosis. Por ello, en los últimos años existe un creciente desarrollo de materiales para la regeneración de tejido óseo.\nEn esta línea de trabajo, la doctora María Josefina Robles Águila, investigadora del Instituto de Ciencias de la BUAP (ICUAP), diseñó un biomaterial para tratar este tipo de lesiones, capaz de estimular la regeneración celular de estos tejidos y sin ser tóxico para el organismo. Se trata de un composito, denominado así por integrar más de dos componentes: en este caso hidroxiapatita con óxido de titanio inmerso en quitosano.\nCon este composito se elaboraron películas que fueron inmersas a un sistema biológico simulado, comprobando que dicho biomaterial induce el crecimiento celular a las primeras 24 horas de incubación y se obtiene un aumento del 60 por ciento de las células del tejido óseo después de 72 horas, destacó la académica nivel I del Sistema Nacional de Investigadores.\nA nivel nanoestructural el hueso está conformado por fibras de colágeno en las que están inmersos nanocristales de hidroxiapatita, por lo que este mineral de fosfato de calcio representa entre el 60 y 70 por ciento del peso del esqueleto humano calcificado (huesos y dientes). Considerando la composición de los huesos, la hidroxiapatita en combinación con otros componentes poliméricos naturales -colágeno o quitosano- sería un biomaterial óptimo para ser utilizado en la regeneración ósea. Sin embargo, presenta poca resistencia mecánica, limitando su uso en la preparación de biomateriales.\nPara conferirle propiedades mecánicas idóneas se incorporó óxido de titanio. Una vez obtenido el composito (hidroxiapatita/óxido de titanio), se realizaron varias pruebas y se evidenció la obtención de una de las fases cristalográficas más importantes de la hidroxiapatita: la monoclínica en la que se encuentra la propiedad piezoeléctrica, capacidad de algunos materiales para generar dipolos eléctricos cuando se les aplica cierta presión, promoviendo la diferenciación y crecimiento celular, explicó la experta adscrita al Centro de Investigación en Dispositivos Semiconductores del ICUAP.\nJosefina Robles, doctora en Ciencias por el Instituto de Física de la BUAP, con especialidad en Ciencia de Materiales, indicó que con el biomaterial nanocomposito se elaboraron películas, las cuales se sumergieron en quitosano para generar un sistema híbrido. Asimismo, a las películas se aplicó corriente eléctrica para promover la regeneración del tejido óseo; este proceso es llamado polarización.\nPosteriormente, la investigadora del ICUAP expuso que dichas películas se incorporaron a un sistema biológico, en este caso a una línea celular WS1(ATCC CRL-1502) con una carga inicial de 5 mil células. Allí se estudió la biocompatibilidad, adhesión, proliferación y crecimiento celular a las 24, 48 y 72 horas, con los biomateriales polarizados y sin polarizar.\n“La incorporación de óxido de titanio en la hidroxiapatita ha mostrado un aumento significativo en sus propiedades mecánicas y mejoras en la adhesión celular, lo que favorece el crecimiento celular a las primeras 24 horas de incubación y obteniendo valores por arriba del 60 por ciento a las 72 horas”, destacó la doctora Robles Águila.\nEn el desarrollo de esta investigación se utilizaron procesos amigables con el medio ambiente, mediante el uso de química verde, como la sonoquímica.\nLa también integrante del Cuerpo Académico 365 “Investigaciones Interdisciplinarias en Ciencia de Materiales” señaló que la siguiente etapa de la investigación será realizar pruebas de citotoxicidad, probar otro polímero (queratina o colágeno), hacer impresión 3D del sistema composito y verificar su comportamiento en otro tipo células como osteoblastos.\nEn esta investigación participó la doctora Ana Karen Sánchez Hernández, egresada del Doctorado en Dispositivos Semiconductores y quien realizó esta investigación como parte de su tesis. También colaboraron las doctoras Eva Águila Almanza, de la Facultad de Ingeniería Química de la BUAP, y Teresita Spezzia Mazzocco, del Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE).\nE",

    "title": "Indegna accusa a Meloni malata, Ferragni in trincea e De Luca: quindi, oggi... - ilGiornale.it",
    "text": "- Trovo indegno che si pensi che Giorgia Meloni voglia volontariamente rimandare la conferenza stampa. I giornalisti che scrivono gli articoli sulla sua malattia, un fastidio agli otoliti che dà vertigini, ipersensibilità alla luce e nausea, pur senza scriverlo lasciano intendere che se lo sia quasi inventato per non presentarsi di fronte ai \"cani da guardia del potere\". Chiunque altro sarebbe stato compatito, lei no. Addirittura Repubblica arriva a paragonarla a Biden alludendo a \"problemi di salute\" che rischiano di \"diventare un caso a sé\" perché \"l'integrità fisica è fondamentale per guidare un Paese\". Cioè: il premier si ammala e annulla solo sei impegni (su migliaia realizzati in un anno) e dovremmo preoccuparci per la tenuta politica del leader di governo?\n- Sapete cosa mi fa impazzire? Che questi poi sono gli stessi che applaudivano Sanna Marin quando decise di mollare la politica perché \"questi anni hanno messo a dura prova la mia resistenza\". E sono gli stessi che hanno sprecato litri di inchiostro per elogiare \"la lezione di Jacinda Ardern \" quando l'ex premier neozelandese si dimise perché non aveva \"più l’energia per continuare\". Patetici.\n- Antonella Viola parla di molestie subite in Italia e all’estero all’università, quando era ricercatrice, ma non fa né nomi né cognomi. Forse non ha le prove e non può rischiare un querelone enorme. Però resto dell’idea che svegliarsi dopo decenni, quando la carriera è avviata e sei un personaggio bello in vista, peraltro senza dare indicazioni di sorta, è troppo semplice.\n- La Treccani segue l’Espresso e sceglie che quest’anno la parola del 2023 è “ femminicidio ”. Una scelta, si legge sul sito dell'Istituto, che \"evidenzia l'urgenza di porre l'attenzione sul fenomeno della violenza di genere, per stimolare la riflessione e promuovere un dibattito costruttivo intorno a un tema che è prima di tutto culturale\". Bla, bla, bla. Che barba, che noia. Era meglio scegliere \"petaloso\".\n- A Cerreto Guidi, nel Fiorentino, un ragazzo suona per scherzo un campanello e viene accoltellato. Solo ora mi accorgo di quante volte ho rischiato la vita da bambino.\n- Il video di Vincenzo De Luca : gli tolgono la sedia da dietro il sedere e lui va gambe all’aria a peso morto. Neppure nei nostri migliori sogni, il 2023 poteva regalarci una gag così dal più teatrale dei personaggi politici. Per fortuna non si è fatto nulla, ma fa ridere a crepapelle.\n- Lavinia Mennuni nella bufera per le sue frasi sulla maternità. Sintesi di Repubblica : “Ricordare alle nostre figlie che la loro massima aspirazione deve essere quella di diventare madre”. Il Corriere : “Le ragazze secondo Mennuni: ‘Fare figli è la loro missione’”. In entrambi i casi, si tratta di bufale. Basta ascoltare il video originale: dice chiaramente che le donne possono fare quello che vogliono, hanno diritto ad ogni aspirazione lavorativa, ma che è importante ricordare alle nostre figlie come diventare madri sia bello e importante, diciamo pure necessario per la società. Il principio è che bisogna cambiare culturalmente l’approccio alla maternità, oggi vista come un dramma e che invece è il fondamento di ogni popolo. Non c’è niente di medievale, no?\n- Ps: il discorso vale, simile, anche per i maschi (un figlio va sempre fatto in due). Eppure il discorso per i due sessi non può essere identico. Anche volendo, un uomo non può passare nove mesi in gravidanza.\n- Interssante invito alla Lega da parte di Lorenzo Fontana , leghista presidente della Camera. In vista delle europee, dice, è preferibile non “tenere i voti in congelatore” ma “mettersi in gioco”. Molto meglio far parte del cambiamento in Ue e se possibile partecipare all’elezione del presidente della Commissione. Cioè, ci pare di poter tradurre: qualora necessario, abbandonare la nave sovranista con Afd e Le Pen per abbracciare il progetto conservatore della Meloni.\n- Gli Usa inviano gli ultimi 250 milioni di dollari di aiuti all’Ucraina. Adesso i soldi sono finiti, almeno fino a che il Congresso non approverà il prossimo pacchetto da 61 miliardi di dollari. I Repubblicani chiedono a Biden di varare leggi restrittive sull’immigrazione in cambio del voto sugli aiuti a Kiev. Tutti a ribadire che il sostegno a Zelensky è “ostaggio” trumpiani brutti e cattivi, ma nessuno che si domandi: perché Biden non concede quello che chiedono? In fondo è in minoranza al Congresso, dunque democrazia vorrebbe che quando necessario scendesse almeno a compromessi.\n- Ogni giorno che passa, una brutta notizia per Chiara Ferragni . Oggi è il turno dell'apertura dell'indagine a Prato. Ormai l'influencer è in trincea e fa quasi tenerezza.\n- Intanto, alla faccia delle decine di titoli di Repubblica nei mesi scorsi, l’Ue ha pagato l’ennesima rata del Pnrr. Senza ritardo alcuno.\n- Lancio su X di Repubblica : “Stati Uniti, la rivolta dei robot: androide aggredisce un ingegnere della Testa”. È una bufala, e pure di quelle grosse. Primo: non c’è stata nessuna rivolta dei robot. Secondo: non riguarda le macchine umanoidi “ Optimus ”, ma un braccio meccanico di una fabbrica come ce ne sono a migliaia in giro per il mondo. Terzo: Elon Musk ha smentito la notizia, ma non mi pare che i debunker siano andati a fare le pulci a Rep o al Corriere . Da quando Elon Musk è diventato all’improvviso brutto e cattivo, nonostante le auto elettriche e tutto il resto, non sprecano occasione per screditarlo. Stavolta però la figuraccia è grossa.",

Belém é central pelo papel de local onde Jesus nasceu, em um estábulo, porque não havia mais espaço para os seus pais na casa. Ali, ele foi colocado em uma manjedoura, o mais humilde dos possíveis berços. Cerca de 2.000 anos depois, peregrinos usualmente viajam para o local onde acreditam que estava o estábulo, na Igreja da Natividade, em Belém, com a maioria dos Natais sendo alegres, com luzes em árvores na Praça da Manjedoura. Mas, devido à invasão de Israel na Faixa de Gaza, [que matou mais de 20 mil pessoas, de acordo com as autoridades locais](https://www.brasil247.com/mundo/numero-de-palestinos-mortos-em-gaza-ultrapassa-marca-dos-20-mil), a maioria dos palestinos de Belém e da Cisjordânia ocupada está de luto. Neste ano, eles decidiram não ter a grande árvore, peça central das celebrações de Natal em Belém, devido à carnificina ocorrendo a 50 quilômetros dali. No lugar do habitual presépio, as igrejas de Belém neste ano colocaram as representações em meio a escombros e arame farpado, em solidariedade às pessoas da Faixa de Gaza. \"Belém é uma mensagem. Não é uma cidade, é uma mensagem de paz para todo o mundo. Deste lugar sagrado, mandamos uma mensagem de paz... parem a guerra, parem o sangue a morte e a revanche\", afirmou o padre Ibrahim Faltas, um frade presente na vigília. Cristãos somam até 2% da população de Israel e dos territórios palestinos ocupados, de acordo com a Protegendo as Terras Cristãs Sagradas, uma campanha organizada pelos chefes da Igreja em Jerusalém. A proporção de cristãos na Faixa de Gaza é menor. A guerra, iniciada pelo ataque do Hamas a Israel em 7 de outubro — com 1.200 mortos, a maioria civis —, manteve distante a maior parte dos turistas estrangeiros esperados para o Natal em Belém. Quando líderes da Igreja se juntaram em Belém no começo deste mês, para o início do Advento, como os cristãos chamam as semanas antes do Natal, poucas pessoas estavam nas ruas e praças, geralmente lotadas. \"O Natal vem a Belém de forma diferente. Hoje Belém, como qualquer cidade palestina, está de luto. Estamos tristes\", afirmou o prefeito da cidade, Hanna Hanania, ao acender uma vela na Praça da Manjedoura.
