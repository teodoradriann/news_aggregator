    "text": "“I was sad to learn this morning of the death of Bishop Willie Walsh, a caring pastor, inspired by love of the Gospel, and, as his own motto put it, a bishop living by ‘the gentleness of Christ’.\n“Throughout his almost 66 years of priesthood, Bishop Willie’s ministry demonstrated God’s love for all people – particularly those on the margins of society.\n“As President of the Irish Catholic Bishops’ Conference, I wish to acknowledge Bishop Willie’s steadfast commitment in support of sacramental marriage. This was evident in his role as President of the Catholic marriage care agency, Accord. Bishop Willie’s leadership in the area of marriage preparation, and counselling, was characterised by his support for all entering into Catholic marriage, as well as in his sincere compassion and outreach for those experiencing difficulties in their marriages and relationships, something which continues to inspire the work of Accord to this day.\n“In addition, I wish to acknowledge Bishop Willie’s strong contribution, from 1994 to 2010, to the work of the Bishops’ Conference, in particular as a member of the Episcopal Commissions for Pastoral Care, Social Welfare; Education; and, of Research and Development.\n“Bishop Willie was a gifted communicator who was a beloved figure in his native diocese of Killaloe, and throughout the country.\n“On behalf of my brother bishops, I wish to express my condolences to Bishop Willie’s family, to Bishop Fintan Monahan of Killaloe, to the priests, religious and faithful of the diocese, and to all who knew and loved him.\n“May Bishop Willie Walsh rest in peace, and may his legacy of love, service, and faith continue to inspire us all.\n“Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dilís.”\nENDS",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

The presence of the whale was promptly reported, although the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has not yet issued a response regarding the removal or retrieval of the animal to shore.\nThere has been a noticeable increase in the number of dead whales and dolphins found along the New Jersey coastline since 2023. This phenomenon has raised concerns among wildlife experts and local communities about the health of marine life in the region.\nThe data indicates a significant rise in mortality rates among these marine mammals, which has prompted investigations by environmental and marine biology experts. The cause of these deaths is currently under extensive study, with several potential factors being considered.\nWhile some believe it is being caused by underground sonar and explosive testing of the sea bed for the impending off-shore wind farms in New Jersey, public officials at the state and federal level dismiss those claims as a conspiracy theory.\nAccording to Save the Dolphins and Whales, NJ, three dolphins have been found deceased in recent days.\nBottlenose Dolphin - Middle Township, Juvenile, 6/14/24.

    "text": "Dossier Seit etwa vier Jahren gibt es in der Spiele-, Tech- und Digitalindustrie ähnlich wie bei Starbucks und Burgerville einen Organisierungstrend – alles Bereiche, die von konservativen Gewerkschaftsstrukturen als „unorganisierbar“ eingeschätzt wurden. Wir hatten im LabourNet Germany bereits im Juni 2022 über die gewerkschaftliche Organisierungskampagne bei Activision Blizzard und regelmäßig über Apple berichtet. Momentan stehen weitere Kampagnen bei dem (digitalen) Kunsthersteller MeowWolf und der Spielefirma SEGA an. Die meisten Gewerkschaftsgruppen haben sich in dem Zusammenhang bei der „Communication Workers of America“ (CWA) angeschlossen, die mitlerweile über 3.000 Mitglieder verzeichnet. Siehe mehr Informationen zu diesen Entwicklungen:\nVideospiel-ArbeiterInnen, in CWA organisiert, haben einen starken ersten Vertrag mit Raven Software (Microsoft) erkämpft\n„ Nach dreijährigen Verhandlungen mit Microsoft haben die QA-Mitarbeiter von Raven ihren ersten Gewerkschaftsvertrag abgeschlossen: „Die Ratifizierung dieses Vertrags ist ein Gewinn für alle Beschäftigten in der Spielebranche“.\nIm Jahr 2022 gründeten die Qualitätssicherungs-Tester des Call of Duty-Studios Raven Software als erste Gewerkschaft bei einem großen amerikanischen Spielehersteller die Game Workers Alliance-CWA. Heute haben die Mitglieder der GWA-CWA nach dreijährigen Verhandlungen für die Ratifizierung ihres ersten Vertrags zwischen der Gewerkschaft und Microsoft gestimmt. Laut einer Pressemitteilung der Communications Workers of America, die die Raven-Gewerkschaftsbemühungen im Jahr 2022 unterstützt hat, sichert der Vertrag eine garantierte Lohnerhöhung von 10 % über einen Zeitraum von zwei Jahren, die Abschaffung von Crunch Time und verlängerten obligatorischen Überstunden, klare Stellenbeschreibungen und Beförderungsprozesse sowie zusätzliche Arbeitnehmerschutzmaßnahmen. „Vom ersten Tag an war es uns wichtig, alle Stimmen im Raum einzubeziehen, und der Vertrag, den wir vorgelegt haben, spiegelt wider, was wir brauchen – bessere Bezahlung, echte Karrierepfade und Schutz vor Burnout. Es ist ein Vertrag, der die Arbeit der QA wirklich wertschätzt“, sagte Erin Hall, QA-Testerin bei Raven und Mitglied des GWA-CWA-Verhandlungsausschusses. „Ich bin stolz auf das, was wir erreicht haben, und ich hoffe, es zeigt anderen Beschäftigten in der Spielebranche, dass gewerkschaftliche Organisierung funktioniert – und dass sie es wert ist …“ engl. Artikel von Lincoln Carpenter vom 5.8.2025 in PC Gamer mit Vorgeschichte (maschinenübersetzt), siehe auch: Raven Software-Beschäftigte sichern sich ersten Vertrag bei Microsoft\n„ Heute stimmten die Mitarbeiter von Raven Software, einem Videospielstudio und einer Tochtergesellschaft unter Microsoft/Activision Blizzard, einstimmig dafür, ihren ersten Gewerkschaftsvertrag zwischen Mitgliedern der Game Workers Alliance-C (GWA-CWA) und Microsoft zu ratifizieren. Der Vertrag baut auf der jüngsten Organisationsdynamik von Microsoft-Videospielarbeitern auf, die sich mit CWA organisieren, um die Standards in der Videospielbranche zu erhöhen, und folgt auf ZeniMax Workers United-CWA-Mitglieder, die sich im Juni einen Vertrag mit dem Tech-Giganten sichern …“ engl.

August 2025 (maschinenübersetzt) EntwicklerInnen von Videospielen streiken mit SAG-AFTRA für den Schutz vor KI durch eine Vereinbarung über interaktive Medien SAG-AFTRA-Mitglieder, die an Videospielen arbeiten, treten in den Streik: Der Schutz vor der künstlichen Intelligenz bleibt der Knackpunkt\n„ Der nationale SAG-AFTRA-Geschäftsführer und Chefunterhändler Duncan Crabtree-Ireland hat im Rahmen der vom nationalen SAG-AFTRA-Vorstand übertragenen Befugnisse und mit dem einstimmigen Rat des Verhandlungsausschusses für die Vereinbarung über interaktive Medien einen Streik für die Vereinbarung über interaktive Medien ausgerufen, der am 26. Juli um 12:01 Uhr in Kraft tritt.\nZu den Tarifparteien, mit denen die SAG-AFTRA verhandelt, gehören Activision Productions Inc, Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc, Electronic Arts Productions Inc, Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc, Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc, VoiceWorks Productions Inc. und WB Games Inc. Jedes Spiel, das SAG-AFTRA-Talente für die Durchführung von Arbeiten beschäftigen möchte, muss das neue Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, das Interim Interactive Media Agreement oder das Interim Interactive Localization Agreement unterzeichnen. Diese Vereinbarungen bieten den Mitgliedern einen wichtigen KI-Schutz.\nDie Verhandlungen begannen im Oktober 2022, und am 24. September 2023 stimmten die SAG-AFTRA-Mitglieder mit 98,32 % Ja-Stimmen für eine Streikerlaubnis für Videospiele. Obwohl in vielen für die SAG-AFTRA-Mitglieder wichtigen Fragen eine Einigung erzielt wurde, weigern sich die Arbeitgeber, in einer klaren und durchsetzbaren Formulierung zu bekräftigen, dass sie alle unter diesen Vertrag fallenden ausübenden Künstler in ihrer KI-Sprache schützen werden …“ engl.

Unterstützungserklärung: CWA-Videospielarbeiter stehen an der Seite von SAG-AFTRA Auch bei der Digital- und Kunstfirma MeowWolf organisieren sich Kolleg*innen\n„Die Gründung einer Gewerkschaft mit meinen Kolleginnen und Kollegen bei der immersiven Kunstfirma Meow Wolf war nicht einfach. Es war stressig und beängstigend. Aber wir haben diese Angst überwunden – und dabei unser Leben verändert. (…) Meine erste Begegnung mit gewerkschaftlichen Bestrebungen war der Morgen im Dezember 2019, an dem mich ein Kollege auf dem Firmenparkplatz beiseite nahm, um mit mir über die aufkeimende Organisierungskampagne unter unseren Kollegen zu sprechen, und mich schließlich fragte, ob ich Interesse hätte, an einer Gewerkschaftssitzung teilzunehmen. Heute weiß ich, dass es sich um ein „Organisierungsgespräch“ mit einem Arbeitenden handelte, dessen Unterstützung für die Gewerkschaft noch nicht bewertet worden war, und dass ich als „Drei“ eingestuft worden wäre – eine Arbeitende, die auf der Skala von eins bis fünf weder offen für noch explizit gegen eine gewerkschaftliche Organisierung seines Betriebs ist. In den meisten Fällen zögern die Arbeitenden aus Angst vor Repressalien, aus Apathie oder wegen eines schweren Burnouts. Bei mir waren es alle drei Gründe. Ich hatte die Worte „Gewerkschaft“ und „Tarifverhandlungen“ gelegentlich in leisen Tönen gehört, aber ich verstand nicht, was sie bedeuteten oder inwiefern sie für mich und meine Arbeit bei Meow Wolf, dem in Santa Fe ansässigen Punk-Kunstkollektiv, das zu einem Multimillionen-Dollar-Unternehmen für immersive Unterhaltung geworden ist, relevant waren. Insgeheim nahm ich an, dass es sich um den letzten einer Reihe von Versuchen handelte, oberflächliche Veränderungen am Arbeitsplatz zu schaffen, die bald wieder vergessen sein würden. In den vier Jahren nach der erfolgreichen Eröffnung des House of Eternal Return (HoER), dem Aushängeschild von Meow Wolfs permanenter Kunstinstallation in Santa Fe, profitierten nur wenige der Dutzenden von Arbeitenden, die die Ausstellung aufgebaut hatten, in irgendeiner Weise von ihrem enormen Erfolg. Die Künstler*innen gehörten zu den am schlechtesten bezahlten Mitarbeitern. Eine scheinbar endlose Flut von Skandalen, unmöglichen Terminen und zunehmend unnahbaren Unternehmensmanagern hatte die Belegschaft erschöpft. Ich war demoralisiert und stand mehr unter Druck als je zuvor. Ich wusste nicht genug darüber, was es bedeutet, eine Gewerkschaft zu gründen, um zu verstehen, wie spektakulär ich die Organisator*innen falsch eingeschätzt hatte. Damals war ich dreiundzwanzig. Einen Monat vor meinem fünfundzwanzigsten Geburtstag war ich eine der Unterzeichner*innen, als das Meow Wolf Workers Collective (MWWC) eine vorläufige Einigung mit unserem Chef erzielte.\nAls mich zum zweiten Mal ein Kollege wegen der Gewerkschaftsbemühungen kontaktierte, saß ich in einem Hotelzimmer in Denver. Ich hatte mich einem kleinen Team angeschlossen, um eine Ortsbesichtigung für die neu angekündigte, bisher ehrgeizigste Dauerausstellung von Meow Wolf, Convergence Station, durchzuführen. Sechs Monate zuvor hatte in den USA gerade die Pandemie begonnen. HoER wurde auf unbestimmte Zeit geschlossen und alle Mitarbeiter von Meow Wolf stellten ihre Arbeit vor Ort ein. Innerhalb von zwei Wochen nach der Schließung von HoER entließ Meow Wolf fast die Hälfte seiner Vollzeitbeschäftigten und stellte sofort eine beträchtliche Anzahl hochbezahlter, außerhalb der Staaten ansässiger Unterhaltungsexperten ein.\nDie Schockwelle der Entlassungen hielt an. Viele von uns hatten Angst vor einer weiteren Runde. Wir hatten miterlebt, wie einige unserer ältesten Freund*innen und Kolleg*innen ihren Job verloren; wir hatten die Arbeit der Leute in unseren Abteilungen übernommen, die nun weg waren. Für mich bedeuteten die Entlassungen, dass ich zum technischen Direktor umgestuft wurde, eine Aufgabe, bei der ich das Design, die Produktion und die Installation der fünf Stockwerke umfassenden Beleuchtungs-, Audio- und interaktiven Technologieprojekte in der Convergence Station beaufsichtigen musste – eine deutlich größere Verantwortung als in meiner vorherigen Funktion. (…) Aber was am Ende des Tunnels wartet, ist eine deutlich bessere Lebensqualität für dich und deine Kolleginnen und Kollegen. Was auf der anderen Seite dieser Angst liegt, ist die wahre Bedeutung von Solidarität, wenn du für Menschen, die du nicht kennst, ein Risiko eingehst, weil du nicht willst, dass sie das durchmachen, was du durchgemacht hast. Lass dich nicht von deinen Ängsten leiten. Du wirst am Ende ein anderer Mensch sein, und das ist ein kostbares Gut, das dir nie genommen werden kann.“ Artikel von Emily Markwiese vom 28. Juni 2023 im Jacobin („Unionizing Made Me a Different Person“) Mehr Infos unter @takesAEGIS, @CWAUnion, @CODE_CWA SEGA Kolleg*innen beginnen mit ihrer Abstimmung über die Gewerkschaftszugehörigkeit\n„Heute beginnen die @takesAEGIS-Mitglieder ihre Gewerkschaftswahlen! Diese Arbeitenden können alle Solidarität der Welt gebrauchen. Sie haben monatelang gegen die unerbittlichen Versuche von SEGA gekämpft, die Gewerkschaft zu zerschlagen, um heute hierher zu kommen. Wir wissen, dass das Unternehmen die Stimmen dieser mutigen Arbeitenden nicht zum Schweigen bringen kann.“ Tweet von CODE-CWA vom 16. Juni 2023 (engl.) Solidarität von Spielefans gegen das SEGA Union-Busting\n„Wir sind so dankbar für eure Unterstützung! Über 4300 Sega-Fans haben eine Petition unterschrieben, in der die Geschäftsführung von Sega of America aufgefordert wird, sich gegenüber unserer Organisierung neutral zu verhalten. Gestern hat eine Gruppe von uns diese Unterschriften mit der Geschäftsführung geteilt und sie erneut aufgefordert, unser Recht auf Organisierung zu respektieren.“ Tweet von AEGIS-CWA vom 15. Juni 2023 (engl.) Kolleg*innen der bekannten Spieleindustrie SEGA organisieren sich\n„Wir sind enttäuscht, dass die Geschäftsführung von Sega beschlossen hat, sich in unser demokratisches Recht einzumischen, uns zu organisieren, bevor die NLRB am 16. Juni [2023] unsere Stimmzettel verschickt. Anstatt den Werten von Sega gerecht zu werden und „das Recht der Beschäftigten zu respektieren, sich zu organisieren, um eine Konsultation zwischen Arbeitgebern und Arbeitnehmern zu ermöglichen“, hat das Management eine Kampagne gestartet, um uns davon abzuhalten, unsere Rechte wahrzunehmen. Wir fordern die Geschäftsleitung auf, ihre gewerkschaftsfeindliche Kampagne einzustellen und sich neutral zu verhalten. Als Sega-Fan bitten wir dich darum: RT diesen Thread\nUnterschreibe unsere Petition an das Management: https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/supportsegaworkers/\nSpielt weiterhin die Sega-Spiele, die wir alle lieben\nWir freuen uns darauf, mit JA zu stimmen und uns mit der Geschäftsführung an den Verhandlungstisch zu setzen, um unsere Vision von einem glücklicheren und gesünderen Sega zu verwirklichen.“ Thread von AEGIS-CWA vom 8. Juni 2023 (engl.) Mehr Infos dazu unter #UnionizeSEGA Missbrauch, Überstunden und Fehlverhalten: Warum die Videospielindustrie Gewerkschaften braucht\n„Angesichts wiederholter Vorwürfe über sexuelles Fehlverhalten, Missbrauch, obligatorische Überstunden und gesundheitsschädliche Arbeitsbedingungen haben sich Menschen, die in der Videospielentwicklung arbeiten, gewerkschaftlich organisiert, um die Branche zum Besseren zu verändern. Während der Entwicklung von Red Dead Redemption 2, dem bahnbrechenden RPG-Western von Rockstar Games, standen die Mitarbeiter/innen, die an dem Spiel arbeiteten, so sehr unter Druck, das Spiel pünktlich fertigzustellen, dass sie anfingen, in ihren Büros zu schlafen. Einem Bericht des Spielemagazins Kotaku zufolge war dies nur eines der wilden Dinge, die die Beschäftigten ertragen mussten. Der Journalist Jason Schreier sammelte Aussagen von Hunderten von Angestellten, die sich in den verschiedenen Rockstar-Studios unter Druck gesetzt fühlten, die ganze Nacht und an den Wochenenden zu arbeiten. Einige Tester der Qualitätssicherung (QA), von denen viele mit Zeitverträgen arbeiteten, erzählten der Publikation, dass sie gezwungen waren, ihre Handys während des Arbeitstages in Schließfächern einzuschließen, während andere sagten, dass sie an ihren Schreibtischen kein warmes Essen zu sich nehmen konnten, obwohl sie zu langen Arbeitszeiten aufgefordert wurden. Überstunden wurden als obligatorisch angesehen, und nach Aussage einiger Studiomitarbeiter herrschte eine „Kultur der Angst“, wenn es darum ging, sich über die Arbeitsbedingungen zu beschweren, da die Mitarbeiter Angst vor möglichen rechtlichen Problemen oder der Sicherheit ihres Arbeitsplatzes hatten.\nRockstar wies diese Behauptungen zurück. Aber diese Geschichte ist kein Einzelfall.\nIm Jahr 2022 wurde Activision Blizzard, das Unternehmen hinter Call of Duty und der Diablo-Franchise, von der Familie eines Mitarbeiters verklagt, der sich 2017 während eines Betriebsausflugs das Leben nahm. Kerri Moynihan, eine 32-jährige Finanzmanagerin des Unternehmens, war angeblich Opfer von sexueller Belästigung geworden, die in dem Unternehmen angeblich weit verbreitet war. Das ging so weit, dass der Staat Kalifornien das Unternehmen 2021 wegen angeblicher systematischer Diskriminierung und Belästigung von weiblichen Beschäftigten verklagte. Die Arbeitenden verließen das Unternehmen sogar aus Protest gegen die giftige „Burschenschaftskultur“. Im selben Jahr leitete die US-Börsenaufsichtsbehörde (SEC) eine Untersuchung gegen das Unternehmen wegen der Vorwürfe und des Umgangs mit Beschwerden über Fehlverhalten ein. (Activision Blizzard erklärte sich bereit, 18 Millionen Dollar an diejenigen zu zahlen, die Fehlverhalten oder Diskriminierung erfahren hatten. Außerdem einigte sich das Unternehmen mit der SEC auf eine Entschädigung von 35 Millionen Dollar). Für viele ist das die Realität der Arbeit in der Videospielbranche: Ausbeutung, Manipulation und unsichere Jobs. Außerdem haben die Unternehmen das Gefühl, dass sie damit durchkommen, weil die Arbeit in der Videospielbranche als Leidenschaft angesehen wird; die Leute nehmen alles in Kauf, weil sie einfach dankbar sind, dabei zu sein.\nDoch es ist ein Wandel im Gange. In den letzten Jahren hat die gewerkschaftliche Organisation in der Branche stark zugenommen. Seit 2021 haben sich die Beschäftigten von mehr als einem Dutzend Studios in den USA gewerkschaftlich organisiert. Den Anfang machten die Arbeitenden von Vodeo Games, die die erste zertifizierte Gewerkschaft für Videospielstudios in den USA gründeten, nachdem die Geschäftsführung die Gewerkschaft freiwillig anerkannt hatte. Ihnen folgten (verständlicherweise) die QA-Arbeitenden bei Raven Software, einem Studio von Activision Blizzard, und die QA-Arbeitenden bei Blizzard Albany, dem Team, das früher unter dem Namen Vicarious Visions bekannt war. Beide wurden vom Unternehmen mit gewerkschaftsfeindlichen Maßnahmen konfrontiert. (Microsoft versucht derzeit, Activision Blizzard für 68,7 Milliarden Dollar zu übernehmen. Sollte der Deal zustande kommen, können sich die Arbeitenden von Activision Blizzard im Rahmen eines Abkommens mit der Communications Workers of America (CWA), der größten Gewerkschaft im Bereich Kommunikation und Arbeit, frei für eine gewerkschaftliche Vertretung entscheiden.) Im Jahr 2023 stimmten 300 QA-Arbeitende im ZeniMax Studio, das Microsoft gehört, für eine Gewerkschaft und gründeten ZeniMax Workers United, zu der auch Beschäftigte des The Elder Scrolls-Entwicklers Bethesda Game Studios und des Studios hinter Doom, id Software, gehören. Ende April 2023 schließlich kündigten die Arbeitenden von SEGA of America, dem US-Zweig des japanischen Spielegiganten und Sonic the Hedgehog-Eigentümers, die Gründung einer Gewerkschaft an.\nDie Gewerkschaft mit der Bezeichnung Allied Employees Guild Improving SEGA (AEGIS) besteht aus einer Mehrheit von 144 Beschäftigten und hat sich mit der CWA zusammengeschlossen. Die AEGIS-CWA bestand aus Beschäftigten aus allen Bereichen von SEGA of America, einschließlich Qualitätssicherung (QA), Lokalisierung, Live-Service, Marketing und Produktentwicklung, und ging als größte abteilungsübergreifende Videospielgewerkschaft in den Vereinigten Staaten in die Geschichte ein. Es war zum Teil diese Flut an gewerkschaftlichen Aktivitäten in den letzten Jahren, die die Beschäftigten bei SEGA of America dazu ermutigt hat, sich zu organisieren. „Es herrschte der Gedanke: ‚Es ist, wie es ist‘, und deshalb haben es so viele Arbeitende akzeptiert. Aber jetzt, wo die gewerkschaftliche Organisierung in einigen wenigen Studios wie ZeniMax und Activision Blizzard zunimmt, ist die Idee in der Öffentlichkeit angekommen“, sagt Mohammad Saman, ein Mitglied der AEGIS-CWA. „Jetzt sehen auch andere Arbeitende, dass es nicht so sein muss, wie es ist. Wir können daraus eine viel nachhaltigere Branche machen.“ Saman arbeitet seit fast fünf Jahren in der Qualitätssicherung bei SEGA, und in dieser Zeit ist der Glanz der Branche getrübt worden. „Ich und meine Kolleginnen und Kollegen sind der Meinung, dass die Bezahlung nicht konkurrenzfähig ist und es zu viele Überstunden gibt“, sagt er. „Es geht im Wesentlichen um die Stunden und die Bezahlung.“ Diese Überstunden, die in der Branche als Crunch bekannt sind, sind allgegenwärtig und, wie Schreiers Bericht über Rockstar Games zeigt, höchst ausbeuterisch. Laut Khan, dem Kommunikationsbeauftragten der IWGB, einer arbeitnehmergeführten, demokratischen Gewerkschaft, die die Rechte der Arbeitenden in der britischen Spieleindustrie vertritt, hat diese Kultur zu einem endemischen Burnout unter den Arbeitenden in der Branche geführt.“Viele Leute verlassen die Spieleindustrie nicht, weil sie in Rente gehen oder weil sie Millionäre geworden sind. Sondern weil sie es nicht mehr aushalten“, sagt Khan, der als Narrative Designer arbeitet. „Wenn Leute aus der Branche aussteigen, verlierst du eine Menge an wirklich gutem und wichtigem Stammeswissen. Man verliert viele Führungspersönlichkeiten und Mentoren, die die Jüngeren zu besseren Entwicklern machen würden.“\nWie viele andere Kreativbranchen ist auch die Videospielwelt auf die Leidenschaft derjenigen angewiesen, die in diesem Bereich arbeiten wollen, und nutzt diese aus. „Die Spieleentwicklung hat in der Vergangenheit von der Akzeptanz einiger unwahrer Fakten oder Annahmen profitiert“, meint Khan. „Eine davon ist, dass es immer zehn Freaks gibt, die auf deinen Job warten. Die andere ist, dass es in erster Linie ein leidenschaftliches Projekt ist, und das bedeutet, dass du nicht leidenschaftlich genug bist, wenn du über Dinge wie Überstunden, Knappheit und Bezahlung meckerst. Es herrscht die Einstellung: „Wir, das Unternehmen, sind deine Leute und du brauchst kein Leben außerhalb der Arbeit, denn wir sorgen für dein Sozialleben. Wir sind der Ort, an dem du Bestätigung, Freundschaften und Beziehungen findest.“ Diese Art von Arbeitsplatzkultur ist ein Nährboden für missbräuchliche, ausbeuterische, diskriminierende und giftige Praktiken. Das zeigen die Zustände bei Activision Blizzard, aber auch die Vorwürfe gegen Riot Games, den Herausgeber von League of Legends, und den Assassin’s Creed-Herausgeber Ubisoft, der mit zahlreichen Anschuldigungen wegen sexuellen Fehlverhaltens und Belästigung am Arbeitsplatz konfrontiert ist. (…) „Die Pandemie hat uns gezeigt, wie wichtig Spiele für unsere globale psychische Gesundheit sind“, sagt Khan. „Das war ein unerwarteter kleiner Moment, aus dem wir alle gelernt haben. Und ich glaube, dass wir es besser machen können und sollten, denn das wird zu besseren Spielen und einer besseren Branche führen, die uns länger hier hält. Das ist mein Ziel. Und das ist das Ziel der Gewerkschaft.“ Artikel von Alim Kheraj vom 30. Mai 2023 auf Dazed Digital („Abuse, overtime and misconduct: why the video game industry needs unions”) Siehe dazu auch (u.a.) im LabourNet Germany:",

E’ quanto annuncia Antonio Sanò, fondatore del sito www.iLMeteo.it secondo il quale la lunga ondata di calore perdurerà almeno fino a Ferragosto. «Fra sabato e domenica - afferma - a Terni sono previsti 37°C, a Firenze 36°C, a Ferrara e Roma 35°C, a Bologna 34°C». E aggiunge: «almeno fino a Ferragosto non si vedono grandi cambiamenti. Il caldo proseguirà e il 2024 segnerà record su record». Nel frattempo sono attesi temporali nelle prossime ore al nordest e nella giornata di sabato al centro. «In seguito, dagli ombrelli aperti, per poche ore, torneremo sotto gli ombrelloni», conclude Sanò. Nel dettaglio Venerdì 2. Al nord: temporali sparsi, specie sul Triveneto e poi in Emilia. Al centro: sole e punte di 37-39°C. Al sud: tanto sole e tanto caldo. - Sabato 3. Al nord: rovesci sparsi sui monti del Triveneto e locali pure in Emilia. Al centro: sole e rovesci sparsi, lieve calo termico. Al sud: veloci piogge sui rilievi. - Domenica 4. Al nord: soleggiato e di nuovo caldo. Al centro: in prevalenza soleggiato e di nuovo molto caldo, ma con temporali sui rilievi. Al sud: soleggiato e sempre molto caldo. Tendenza: ennesima fiammata africana da lunedì 5 agosto in poi, caldo per almeno 10 giorni, ma con qualche temporale di calore sui rilievi.",

    "text": "'We're not cheats', insist Canada after Olympic football spying scandal\nSaint-Étienne (France) (AFP) – Canada defender Vanessa Gilles insisted her team were \"not cheats\" despite a spying scandal before their 2-1 opening win over New Zealand in the Olympic women's football competition on Thursday.\nIssued on:\nAssistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joey Lombardi were sent home from the Games in Paris on Wednesday.\nLombardi was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session in Saint-Etienne in the build-up to the match.\nFIFA has since opened disciplinary proceedings against Canada.\n\"Honestly, it wasn't easy,\" Gilles told reporters.\n\"There was a lot of emotion, frustration and humiliation because as a player, it doesn't reflect our values and what we want to represent as competitors at the Olympics.\n\"The Games represent fair play. As Canadians, these are not our values or those of our country. We are not cheats. It was very hard but we knew how to be united.\"\nCanada are defending their Olympic title in Paris after defeating Sweden to win gold in Tokyo three years ago.\n\"It's up to us to stay together and try not to let social media and the press break into our bubble,\" added on-loan Lyon defender Gilles. \"We've been able to do that in the past.\"\nHead coach Bev Priestman also took no part in the game after the controversy, but is expected to be back on the bench for Canada's second Group A match against France on Sunday.\n\"She took a step back from this match and left the bench to her assistants but for the next matches, she should take her place again,\" said Gilles.\nGoals from Arsenal forward Cloe Lacasse and Evelyne Viens helped Canada come from behind to win.\nNew Zealand coach Michael Mayne refused to blame the spying incident on his side's loss.\n\"I don't want to make excuses for this result,\" he said.\n\"But, yes, we are disappointed. There is the question of how this happened and the reasons that led to this situation.\n\"Yes, maybe it influenced part of the game. We wanted to play and we did our best.\"\nNew Zealand next face Colombia on Sunday, needing to avoid defeat to give their quarter-final hopes a boost.\n© 2024 AFP",
