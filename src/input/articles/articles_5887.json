    "title": "Napoli manager Walter Mazzarri hails super-sub Alessio Zerbin after reaching Italian Supercup final in Riyadh",
    "text": "RIYADH: Walter Mazzarri has hailed substitute Alessio Zerbin for helping Napoli overcome Fiorentina 3-0 to earn a coveted place in the EA SPORTS FC Italian Supercup final in Riyadh.\nThe Napoli manager brought the 24-year-old attacker off the bench with nine minutes remaining of the Supercup semifinal and his side 1-0 up from Giovanni Simeone’s goal at Al-Awwal Park.\nZerbin made an immediate impact, stabbing home at the back post in the 84th minute and then —returning to the field after treatment required from scoring that goal — blasting home into the bottom corner just two minutes later.\nWith the reigning Lega Serie A champions determined to add the Supercup to the trophy room at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Mazzarri was emphatic in his praise of Zerbin.\nMazzarri said: “Sometimes we underestimate young players at home, and we go looking abroad, however Zerbin is gifted and a modern player. He sometimes rushes and should gain in self-confidence, but he will have a bright future if he keeps training and improving where he needs.”\nNapoli now look forward to the Supercup final on Monday, Jan. 22, when they will play the winner of the Inter versus Lazio semifinal on Friday.\nBoth matches take place at Al-Awwal Park and begin at 10 p.m. Saudi Arabia time.\nNapoli goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini, who said it would mean “a lot” to win the Supercup final, added: “We were all very happy for Zerbin. He is a young player who puts in a lot of effort in training, and it is only right that he got the chance to score tonight.\n“Napoli are a strong team with many strong players, so some people have to accept sitting on the bench for the team. The important thing is that we are always united as a group, and we give our best.”\nNapoli took the lead in the 22nd minute on Thursday night when a delightful through-ball by Juan Jesus was drilled into the bottom corner by the right foot of Giovanni Simeone from a tight angle. The Argentine striker — the son of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone — took the most delicate of touches to set himself for the shot before finishing.\nOn the stroke of half-time, Fiorentina spurned a golden opportunity to go level when Jonathan Ikone was tripped in the box by Mario Rui. The resultant penalty, however, saw the French forward’s left-footed effort soar over the bar.\nFiorentina manager Vincenzo Italiano admitted it was a turning point and said: “He’s a good penalty taker and usually buries them. But unfortunately, it wasn’t the case today.”\nItaliano added: “I feel disappointed knowing that we could have performed better and come out at the end with a positive result.”\nThe end, however, belonged to Zerbin, who scored his first goal by converting Leo Ostigard’s headed flick-on from Piotr Zielinkski’s outswinging corner kick, and then sprinted clear to strike the cleanest of right-footed shots into the bottom corner.\nThe 36th edition of the historic Supercoppa Italiana marks the fourth time that the prestigious competition is being held in Saudi Arabia.\nFor the first time, the Supercup features four teams — the winners and runners-up of Lega Serie A and the Coppa Italia — instead of previous editions where the winners played a one-off match.",

    "title": "Giant Waves Close Out California’s Remarkable Year of Weather Phenomena",
    "text": "Part of Kingston Lane, a street adjacent to the beach in Ventura, Calif., was flooded after the high surf breached the area.\nSAN FRANCISCO — Giant waves pounded the coast of California on Thursday, causing big headaches, closing beaches and toppling some people who watched the unusual waterfront show.\nWaves topping 30 feet broke onto shores up and down the state, prompting stark warnings, such as one from the National Weather Service’s Bay Area division: “The ocean is NOT your friend today!”\nHigh surf warnings remain in effect through early Friday, the Weather Service said, and waves surpassing 40 feet are possible. The coastal unrest was caused by a series of storms with hurricane-force winds brewing over the Pacific Ocean, pushing big swells toward the state.\n“Stay away from rocks, jetties, piers, and other waterside infrastructure,” the Weather Service added. “Never turn your back to the ocean!”\nNot everybody took the warnings to heart. A much-shared video on X showed little kids being pummeled by a big wave that threw them to the ground as they watched the surge on West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz, 75 miles south of San Francisco. The children appeared shocked but fine as the water receded.\nIt seemed fitting that California could not escape 2023 without one final bout of extraordinary weather phenomena after a year that delivered torrential rainstorms, blizzards in Southern California mountains, a rare tropical storm and the re-emergence of an ancient lake.\nFarther down the coast in Ventura, a beach town south of Santa Barbara, Brandt Hammer, 60, was cleaning up Thursday afternoon after waves surged into residential streets and flooded some homes. The water carried sand and debris with it, blocking storm drains.\nMr. Hammer and his wife moved to Kingston Lane, which runs right up to the beach, after their previous house nearby burned down in the Thomas fire in 2017.\n“We always said the only thing we have to worry about now is tsunamis,” he said with a laugh. “A lady who’s lived here 30 years said she’s never seen it like this.”\nIn one instance, a wave was powerful enough to crash over a beach wall, knock over adults and propel a truck down a road. Eight people were hospitalized with minor injuries from that wave alone, according to Andy VanSciver, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, which posted a video of the incident on X. Ten people were rescued from the water countywide, he said.\nBecky Clearwater said she walked on Thursday from her home in Ventura to the beach to survey the storm surge and was surprised to see its consistency and strength.\n“It was wave after wave after wave,” she said.\nThe waves destroyed a bench etched with the names of 20 dogs that neighbors had lost over the years, she said.\n“It’s been our little thing for a long time, and we lost it today,” she said. “It’s gone, but we’ve already got plans in the works to build another one.”\nIn Stinson Beach, a coastal town about 20 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, the local Fire Department ordered the evacuation of several small roads near the beach because of a high risk of damage from waves and coastal flooding. Residents and visitors were told to “evacuate immediately for life safety,” and a community center was converted into an evacuation point. The order was lifted later in the day.\nHeather Vantress, the owner of Sandpiper Lodging at the Beach, said she noticed that the tide appeared very high on her morning drive to the hotel, but that her business was not affected because it was high enough above the shore.\nThursday’s waves, she said, were nothing compared with the repeated battering of the town last winter, when California was hit by a series of atmospheric rivers.\n“Last year, it was so bad people were freaking out — that was way worse,” she said. “The beach got really destroyed last year, but it all came back.”\nOfficials in Santa Cruz County warned residents to prepare to evacuate near Seacliff State Beach, not far from where intense waves tore a house off its foundations in January. On Thursday, crews elsewhere cleared debris scattered onto the shoreline highway by the ocean, and several car turnouts near area beaches were closed. Some streets in the area were flooded.\nBut the storm surge brought excitement, too — at least among the big wave surfers who were out at Mavericks, the famous surf break off the coast of Half Moon Bay, a town 30 miles south of San Francisco.\nA local surf camera measured waves at “XXL,” noting that they ranged from 30 to 40 feet high. Crowds of people lined the cliffs to watch the surfing spectacle.\nAs residents cleaned up in Ventura, they were aware that more storm conditions and big waves were expected on Friday.\n“I’m more worried about tomorrow,” Mr. Hammer said.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Preparing for change in a well-established, well-capitalized industry is not easy.\nSuch is the story for ticker symbol BYND, formally known as Beyond Meat (BYND) in supermarket aisles across the US.\nWhile Beyond Meat's stock price has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown has not. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry executive is focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n“We believe the cycle of history is in our favor and we're going to turn it into long-term success,” Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above). ,\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business.\nBeyond Meat burst onto investors' radar with a spectacular initial public offering on Nasdaq on May 5, 2019.\nInvestors gobbled up shares of a company they viewed as a leader in the emerging plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 per share, opened for trading at $46 and then rose to $65.75 by the close. Profit at the closing bell: a delicious 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite on May 2, 2019 in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\nFrom there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, including big deals with global restaurant chains like Yum! The brand is planning expansion into the refrigerated food sections of retailers such as KFC and Dunkin' Donuts (YUM), Target (TGT) and overseas, and efforts are underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items. Are.\nBy July 2019, Beyond Meat shares reached a peak of $234.90 per share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the restaurant industry, and its financial impact sent people turning back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat's impressive momentum has stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including rival Impossible Foods.\nAdditionally, attacks from strong parties in the meat industry and media on the healthfulness of plant-based items have damaged Beyond Meat's standing with consumers. By November 2022, as losses hit cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its employees.\nThen in November this year, Beyond Meat – which has cut prices to stimulate demand – said it would cut 19% of its non-production workforce after a lower-than-expected third quarter.\nThird-quarter sales fell 8.7% from a year earlier to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million based on adjusted operating profit.\n“You know there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and especially after the IPO,” Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round. “It was going to happen overnight.” Retrenchment. “This has clearly not been proven to be the case.”\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: surround yourself with great people, take a long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course.\n“But the reason we started this company and the reason consumers are reaching out to a product is getting stronger day by day, whether it's the health aspect, whether it's climate, whether it's energy and Whether it's water use or animal welfare,” Brown added. , “All of those issues are becoming serious, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.”\nToday, Beyond Meat's stock is trading at $8.95 per share – well below its staggering post-IPO high. According to comparative data from Yahoo Finance, the company has a market cap of $577.6 million, while Meat King Tyson (TSN) has a market cap of $18.46 billion.\n“In terms of the reasons for the softening in the US, it's pretty much the same: consumers continue to shy away from the category for a number of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or lack thereof),” said JPMorgan packaged foods analyst Kane. Are included.” Goldman said.\nGoldman has given Beyond Meat shares an underweight rating, which is equivalent to a sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat Founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) inside their new El Segundo, California headquarters about the path forward for the plant-based meat company. (Yahoo Finance)\nBrown, meanwhile, is focused on dismissing the critics. Beyond Meat recently opened a massive 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, California, just steps away from the headquarters of Barbie maker Mattel (MAT). The space is equipped with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a typically open floor plan that could herald the next big thing in plant-based dining.\nThe new facility also features a McDonald's (MCD) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 tall Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often walks around the building to interact with staff with his trademark calm, welcoming atmosphere.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won't be easy and he's not in the mindset to consider the business path forward yet at this point. But he will not shy away from his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and passion.\n“I want to see [my mission] Until completion,” Brown said. ''I think it would be something [that] When it's all said and done, I'll look back. But I'm in a fight right now, so it's hard to watch.”\nbrian sozzi is the executive editor of Yahoo Finance.

By Brian Buntz | December 5, 2024\n[Adobe Stock]\nIf you read much about AI, you’ve likely noticed the growing number of models capable of “reasoning” and acting autonomously. This isn’t just about chatbots; it’s transforming scientific discovery. Google DeepMind recently launched a 15-day weather forecasting agent, bringing new levels of accuracy to complex atmospheric modeling. OpenAI’s latest reasoning model, o1, has demonstrated potential in scientific text analysis, accelerating literature reviews and hypothesis generation. It also is capable of math unlike most large language models. Beyond these headline-grabbing advances, AI agents are gradually finding use in research labs, automating experiments and analyzing complex datasets. Stanford’s Virtual Lab, for example, taps AI agents to collaboratively design new nanobodies. As these technologies mature, companies ranging from Microsoft to Salesforce are betting that AII agents offer revenue potential potentially untethered from traditional user-based software licenses. With Zdnet reporting that one-quarter of enterprises plan to deploy agents in 2025, this transformation is rapidly gaining steam. But the rise of agents is likely to be limited to defined use cases initially. It may not be time for a while to hand over the reins to AI for some time. “People think if ChatGPT can do something, it can do anything humans can and more,” remarked Mike Connell, chief operating officer at Enthought. Yet he also warned that dismissing these technologies out of hand is shortsighted. The potential of AI systems to do even rote tasks that humans once did — with minimal oversight — makes agents an unavoidable potential reality. “It’s not going to fizzle out.”\nWhen seeking areas to explore agents, start small, he recommended. “If you take something like coding … it’s safe. You can let it do that. If it breaks, it’s not catastrophic,” Connell said. He contrasted these limited-risk applications with the prospect of entrusting an AI to run a nuclear reactor—an idea he called “not happening in 2025, but maybe by 2030 or 2035.” But it’s now time to start think about putting agents to work — if only for limited projects — such as building out a prototype app. “We’ve opened up this design space,” he reminds us, “and we need to figure out how to best fill it.”\nPreserving human oversight and establishing risk boundaries Mike Connell\nThe challenge, Connell pointed out, lies in quantifying “when is ‘good’ good enough?” The difficulty of pinning down acceptable error rates becomes clearer as AI agents venture into high-stakes territory. Traditional oversight models—designed for human operators—will struggle to keep pace with AI systems that can adapt or even go off-script. Anthropic shares the story of a computer using its Claude model that took a break from work to peruse photos of Yellowstone . While a comical example, the potential of generative AI models to act in unpredictable ways will be a concern when building agents that can stay on task. “We need to figure out what additional components or use-case patterns we need to embed … so [models] perform better,” Connell said.\nHuman-like reasoning modules, specialized domain training, and robust testing protocols may all be parts of the solution. Connell likened current large language models to a “blob of cortex,” an engine of raw capability that emerged at scale. “They didn’t design it for all these applications; these capabilities emerged with scale, surprising even the engineers.”\nRedefining human responsibilities While a coding agent is one thing, a robotic agent is another. For instance, if lab robots can handle the repetitive, time-consuming execution of experiments, biologists and scientists are effectively freed to operate as strategic directors. No longer must they worry about, say, pipetting, recalibrating equipment or counting cells on slides. Unsteady, they can reflect more on what frontiers to probe and what data they need to get there.\nAI-assisted coding: A glimpse at agentic capabilities AI agents are writing that can produce functional apps in minutes. While an emerging technology, promise use cases are emerging for non-developers and developers alike. Connell recounts the story of a friend, a “a super developer” working with an expert from a famous startup incubator. “In three days, he and his colleagues created an entire website to implement the prototype, and they wrote zero code,” Connell said. “It works; he showed me the site.”\nConnell also recounts his experience using applications such as Git Copilot and Cursor.ai. He praised the workflow of the latter platform, highlighting features like the compose mode, which allows developers to outline their app requirements and have the AI generate multiple files as a starting point. “You can highlight lines and say, ‘Here’s what I need,’ and in chat mode, it’ll surgically edit those,” he continued.\nThe traditional path of gaining mastery through hands-on repetition may fade, replaced by a model where human insights guide a cohort of automated systems, each carrying out complex protocols. The result might be more rapid discovery, but it also forces us to consider what it means to be an expert when the fundamental training ground—performing routine, foundational tasks—has been outsourced to machines. “If machines are doing all the foundational work, how do people build expertise to reach the point they can be creative?” Connell asked.\nHumans have wrestled with similar existential questions before. In the Victorian era, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859) challenged traditional religious views by introducing the theory of evolution. Some theologians agreed to ascribe more responsibility for natural phenomena to science, leading to a gradual shrinking of the domain where divine intervention was seen as necessary, a retreat sometimes referred to as the “God of the gaps” argument. Other theologians responded by rejecting the infringement of science. Examples include the American Presbyterian Charles Hodge; the Anglican priest, geologist and mentor to Darwin, Adam Sedwick; and the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce criticized the theory of evolution.\nIn the modern age, the encroachment of AI agents threatens to lead to similar tensions. Is there a domain of human intuition, moral judgment, or long-range conceptual thinking that no AI can replicate—or will these too shrink over time? The Elsevier study “ Insights 2024: Attitudes toward AI “ found that 92% of scientists foresee cost reductions in institutions and businesses, but many have concerns, too. More than nine out of ten, 94% are worried about AI’s use to spread misinformation while 86% worry about critical errors. Nearly the same amount, 85% have concerns about privacy, bias, and loss of human judgment and empathy.\nSome of those worries pertain more to the long term. In the short term, genAI is more commonly used to accelerate scientific literature generation. A 2023 Nature survey found that nearly 30% of scientists have used generative AI tools to assist in writing manuscripts, and about 15% have employed them for drafting grant applications. The Elsevier study found that 54% had used AI tools, but only 31% have done so for work-related purposes.\nIt takes a village — and the right data approach In the near term, much of the challenge lies in building out the right environments and guardrails for these AI agents. As Connell put it, “We’ve pulled off a slice of something out of context, and it lacks the other structures that would make it exhibit human-like behaviors.” Today’s models may surprise even their developers, straying from intended tasks or failing at seemingly trivial ones. Yet these same models can handle safe, well-defined jobs—writing code snippets, preparing summaries, or running routine lab tests—and do so at speeds that encourage cautious optimism.\nWhile it is plausible that agents may one day help scientists and R&D-heavy organizations get more bang for their research buck, longer-term progress may hinge on rethinking how we approach scientific data itself.\nThe off-the-shelf mainstream large language models, for instance, have been trained on essentially the entire public internet plus other curated data sets. While researchers in domains such as genomics, astronomy and beyond have explored datasets that are many terabytes in size, many scientific AI databases are not as large as what a large language model would ingest. “We don’t have that level of data for chemistry and biology, so we can’t leverage it the same way,” Connell said. “Language models appear to do creative tasks because of the vast amount of data. We don’t have enough data to map the parameter spaces in chemistry and biology sufficiently.” If researchers did have such access, the models could do a better job at helping pinpoint unexplored areas worth investigating. “If organizations collecting redundant data would collaborate and contribute to a shared map, we’d make significant progress.”\nBut creating such a map would be a significant undertaking necessitating a shift from one-off projects to a more collaborative endeavor. “If you had a model of the parameter space — which surrogate models allow — you could look up information quickly,” Connell said. “This separation allows you to distinguish between the science of mapping the parameter space and the engineering of product design,” he said. This doesn’t necessarily involve agents unless they are helpful in this regard, but such analysis does typically involve deep learning. Having such maps could lead to more cost-effective R&D. “If we could do that, companies could do R&D more efficiently. We’d stop focusing solely on specific projects and collaborate to map parts of the parameter space that many care about, like how AlphaFold 2 did for protein folding. Everyone could then build on that for product design.”",
