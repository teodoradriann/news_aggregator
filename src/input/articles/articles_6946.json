LOUIS — The St. Louis City Fire Department conducted ice water rescue training to prepare for emergencies related to winter weather and thin ice.\nThe training involved about 30 tactical firefighters from Engine House One and Engine House Eleven, who are part of the Marine One task force. This specialized unit handles various rescue missions, including swift water and ice rescues, especially important as temperatures drop below freezing.\n“They’re going to start losing their ability to think properly, respond to verbal commands, and eventually just pass out, and it’s a very rapid process; in a matter of minutes it will happen,” said Captain Ross Hetz of the St. Louis City Fire Department.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “I don’t know that we get scared; when the time comes, we do our job; we don’t really think about being scared,” said Ian McGahan, a fire private with the St. Louis City Fire Department.\n‘Imo’s Pizza is my ayahuasca;’ Jimmy Kimmel explains distaste for St. Louis staple\nThe training took place near the Benton Park Pond in South City, where ice can pose a significant danger to children and pets. The firefighters practiced scenarios involving self-rescue and victim rescue on the ice.\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers reports a 500% increase in drowning risk due to the shock of cold water, highlighting the importance of this training. With the specialized training, the St. Louis City Fire Department is better prepared to handle ice-related emergencies, ensuring safety for both the rescuers and those in need of rescue.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement All facts from this article were gathered by KTVI journalists.

    "title": "Cambiamenti climatici e mortalità da freddo negli Stati Uniti: un aumento allarmante",
    "text": "Secondo un nuovo studio condotto dalla Harvard Medical School e pubblicato su JAMA, il tasso di mortalità da freddo negli Stati Uniti è aumentato drasticamente dal 1999 al 2022. In particolare, il numero di morti causate dal freddo o in cui il freddo ha avuto un ruolo significativo è più che raddoppiato durante questo periodo. Questi dati sembrano riflettere un’inaspettata incidenza di eventi meteorologici estremi , probabilmente legati ai cambiamenti climatici.\nNonostante le temperature medie stiano aumentando a livello globale, diversi studi hanno evidenziato che il cambiamento climatico non si traduce solo in ondate di calore più frequenti, ma anche in episodi di inverni più rigidi . Questo tipo di clima, infatti, è associato a un aumento del numero di decessi legati al freddo.\nNel dettaglio, tra il 1999 e il 2022, 40.079 persone sono morte a causa del freddo o per condizioni correlate. Il tasso di mortalità è aumentato significativamente, passando da 0,44 decessi ogni 100.000 persone nel 1999 a 0,92 decessi ogni 100.000 persone nel 2022. L’incremento è stato particolarmente evidente tra gli adulti di 75 anni o più, con un numero maggiore di decessi tra gli uomini rispetto alle donne. Tuttavia, entrambi i sessi hanno visto un aumento della mortalità correlata al freddo nel corso del periodo studiato.\nGli autori dello studio suggeriscono che i principali fattori alla base di questo aumento potrebbero includere “ eventi meteorologici invernali estremi più frequenti e/o il crescente peso dei fattori di rischio per la mortalità correlata al freddo, come la mancanza di una casa, l’isolamento sociale e l’uso di sostanze “. Questi risultati sottolineano l’urgenza di affrontare le sfide poste dai cambiamenti climatici, con un focus particolare sulle vulnerabilità delle persone anziane e le situazioni di emarginazione sociale.\nIl quadro complessivo suggerisce che, mentre il riscaldamento globale porta a inverni più severi in alcune aree, l’adattamento delle politiche sanitarie e sociali sarà cruciale per ridurre l’impatto di eventi meteo estremi sulla salute pubblica.",

    "text": "Israeli troops killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15 when it mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said on Thursday, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding. On Dec. 15, the military immediately took responsibility for killing the three hostages, who were abducted by militants during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on towns in southern Israel. They were among 240 people taken hostage by the Palestinian group. The Israel military published its findings on Thursday and concluded “that there was no malice in the event, and the soldiers carried out the right action to the best of their understanding of the event at that moment.” The statement said that army chief General Herzi Halevi had “emphasized the utmost importance of adhering to standard operating procedures.” “In a situation where there is no immediate threat and the identification is not a clear enemy, there is a need for a moment of examination before firing, given the opportunity,” he said. The killing of the three hostages when they approached Israeli troops in the Shejaiya area of Gaza City, shook Israelis. The investigation found that, during intense days of fighting, there was no intelligence indicating the hostages were being held in buildings where troops encountered heavy fire. The military said footage showed the hostages had removed their shirts and that one of them was waving a white flag but they were only identified as hostages after their bodies had been examined. The hostages’ cries for help were also misinterpreted as deception by militants attempting to draw troops into an ambush. “The IDF failed in its mission to rescue the hostages in this event,” Halevi said. “The entire chain of command feels responsible for this difficult event, regrets this outcome, and shares in the grief of the families of the three hostages.” Pressure has been mounting on the Israeli government to broker a deal to release the more than 100 hostages who remain in Gaza following the release of 110 others during a week-long truce in November. During the truce, Hamas released more than 100 women, children and foreigners it was holding in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and teenagers being held in Israeli jails.

    "title": "First Commonwealth (FCF) Q2 EPS Up 36%",
    "text": "Core diluted earnings per share were $0.38 for Q2 2025, beating analyst expectations by 35.7%.\nNon-GAAP revenue fell short of estimates, coming in 53% lower than anticipated.\nLoan growth and net interest margin both improved, but asset quality metrics weakened due to a specific commercial credit issue.\nFirst Commonwealth Financial (NYSE:FCF), a regional bank serving Pennsylvania and Ohio, reported its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on July 29, 2025. The company delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38, outpacing analyst estimates of $0.28 (non-GAAP), a 35.7% improvement. However, non-GAAP revenue was $58.68 million, well below the Street non-GAAP estimate of $125.88 million. Despite stronger net interest margin and solid loan book growth, the quarter was overshadowed by a significant jump in nonperforming loans following a specific commercial credit event. Overall, while operational and capital strength stood out, the period's results were mixed due to the revenue miss and asset quality setbacks.\nMetric | Q2 2025 | Q2 2025 Estimate | Q2 2024 | Y/Y Change |\n---|---|---|---|---|\nEPS (Non-GAAP) | $0.38 | $0.28 | $0.36 | 5.6% |\nRevenue (Non-GAAP) | $131.3 million | $125.88 million | $120.5 million | 9.0% |\nCore Return on Average Assets | 1.31 % | 1.27 % | 0.04 pp | |\nNet Interest Margin (FTE) | 3.83 % | 3.57 % | 0.26 pp | |\nCore Efficiency Ratio | 54.06 % | 53.63 % | 0.43 % | |\nNet Charge-offs as % of Average Loans | 0.12 % | 0.20 % | (0.08 pp) |\nThe bank operates a network focused on consumer, commercial, mortgage, and equipment finance, supported by wealth management and insurance subsidiaries. Its main markets are Pennsylvania and Ohio, where it offers checking and savings accounts, loans, wealth management, and insurance through over 120 community branches.\nRecently, the company has concentrated on expansion through strategic acquisitions and organic loan growth. Important drivers include managing credit risk, strengthening its capital base, maintaining regulatory compliance, and broadening its sources of fee income. Key factors for success remain disciplined underwriting, integration of acquired banks, and competitive positioning within its core regions.\nLoan growth accelerated, with total loans (net of acquisitions) up $183.7 million, or 8.1% annualized compared to the previous quarter. Commercial real estate and equipment finance portfolios saw the fastest expansion. For example, equipment finance loans jumped from $486 million last quarter to $574 million, and Commercial real estate loans grew to $3.37 billion at June 30, 2025, from $3.16 billion at March 31, 2025. This loan growth, combined with higher yields on new loans and disciplined funding costs, drove net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income and interest expense relative to earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.83% in the second quarter of 2025, an increase of 0.21 percentage points from the previous quarter and 0.26 points from Q2 2024.\nThe company completed its acquisition of CenterBank, bringing in $45.9 million in new shareholders’ equity and new talent to the lending team. Management cited successful early integration and anticipation of improved mortgage and consumer lending opportunities, particularly in Ohio markets. The acquisition contributed 0.04 percentage points to the net interest margin thanks to accounting adjustments on loans and deposits acquired from CenterBank.\nNoninterest income, which includes fees from services like mortgage origination, gain on loan sales, and insurance, was $24.7 million. While this was up $2.3 million from the prior quarter, it was slightly below the year-ago period, mainly due to lower card interchange revenue resulting from debit card fee caps (the Durbin amendment). Fee income from mortgage and Small Business Administration (SBA) loan sales increased quarter over quarter.\nOn expenses, noninterest expense (which includes salaries, occupancy, and operational costs) climbed to $76.3 million, up $5 million from last year. The workforce grew to 1,562 full-time equivalent employees, up from 1,538 in the previous quarter and 1,472 in the same period last year.\nWhile core earnings were strong, the quarter saw a sizable increase in nonperforming loans. These rose to $99.5 million from $59.4 million in the previous quarter, largely the result of a single commercial floorplan loan moved to nonaccrual status. This pushed nonperforming loans to 1.04% of total loans, compared to 0.65% last quarter and 0.63% a year ago. Criticized and classified loans—loans showing signs of credit risk—also increased significantly, indicating some broadening in credit weakness.\nDespite these pressures, Net charge-offs, or loans written off as uncollectable, declined to $2.8 million (0.12% of average loans), marking a decrease from both the prior quarter (Q1 2025) and last year (Q2 2024). The bank significantly boosted its GAAP provision for credit losses, setting aside $8.9 million compared to $5.7 million in Q1 2025, in response to the higher nonperforming loan values. The allowance for credit losses covers 1.39% of total loans, up from 1.32% in the earlier quarter.\nThe bank’s capital ratios remain robust and well above regulatory minimums. At quarter end, the total capital ratio stood at 14.4% versus a required minimum of 10% as of June 30, 2025. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which tests the bank’s ability to withstand losses, was 12.0% as of June 30, 2025. Tangible book value per share, which values the bank's equity minus intangible assets, reached $10.63, up 7.3% annualized versus the earlier quarter.\nA higher loan-to-deposit ratio of 95.1%, up from 92.6% last quarter, reflects loan growth outstripping deposit gathering, a trend that could pressure funding if deposits stagnate. End-of-period deposits dipped slightly, but average deposits excluding the acquisition rose.\nThe board authorized a 3.7% increase in the quarterly dividend, declared a $0.135 per share dividend, and approved a new $25 million share buyback program. The annualized dividend yield stands at 3.3% on recent share prices as of July 28, 2025.\nThe bank’s core business lines include standard consumer banking, commercial lending, insurance products, wealth management, and equipment finance. Fee-based services are an increasingly important focus as management aims to reduce reliance on traditional net interest income. For example, commercial loans and real estate lending continued to expand this quarter as part of the bank’s strategy to gain scale and improve earnings stability.\nCard-related fee revenue contracted due to full application of the Durbin amendment, a federal rule that limits certain debit card fees for banks above $10 billion in total assets. Mortgage-related gains and SBA loan sales, however, offset part of this decline. Management said Efforts to improve fee generation are ongoing and remain a core priority.\nThe company did not provide updated financial guidance for the rest of fiscal 2025. Previous commentary suggested the net interest margin could further expand by approximately 0.10 percentage points by year end 2025, assuming few changes in deposit costs or Federal Reserve rates. Targets for loan growth remain in the mid-single-digit percentage range, as reiterated by management.\nInvestors should watch evolving asset quality metrics, especially any further movement in criticized or nonperforming loan balances, as credit risk surfaced this quarter after a period of stability. The integration of the CenterBank acquisition remains a focus area, with management expecting it to add to per-share earnings from 2026. The newly authorized share repurchase and steady dividend growth highlight the bank's strong capital position, but trends in fee income, loan-to-deposit ratio, and capital deployment will be critical in the coming quarters.\nThe quarterly dividend was raised to $0.135 per share, a 3.9% increase from the prior year.\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

    "text": "The Bhootnii Review: Sanjay Dutt And Mouni Roy Struggle To Lift A Loud, Middling Film\nThe Bhootnii Movie Review: Feel free to give this film a miss and if you miss Sanjay Dutt, you better go watch Munna Bhai MBBS and Lage Raho Munna Bhai for the umpteenth time.\nThe BhootniiU/A\nWatch Trailer\nThe Bhootnii Movie Review: This is the age of horror-comedies and may god spare us from this wave! This week’s brand-new (that’s debatable) horror-comedy is The Bhootnii and it makes you wonder if succumbing to the formula is enough. What about the screenplay? And what about the treatment? Is brand ‘horror-comedy’ enough to entice a crowd into a theatre? It’s a big, fat NO. The Bhootnii – though based on a decent plotline – is bereft of both horror and comedy and is too ambitious for its own good. What’s left is a middling screenplay that tries too hard to keep the film afloat.\nIt revolves around The Virgin Tree. Delhi University alumni must be familiar with it. For those who aren’t, every year, the students of Hindu College used to perform the Damdami Mai puja (worship of The Virgin Tree) on campus, hoping to find love. One of the key highlights of the event included praying to a Bollywood actor and actress. This one time, the chosen celebrity was Sunny Leone. But coming back to The Bhootnii – that was previously titled The Virgin Tree – is set in a college called St Vincent College of Art and Culture.\nOn every Valentine’s Day, the students offer garlands, photographs and notes to a tree on the campus with the anticipation that they too will soon have a blossoming love life and a happening sex life. But little do they know that a spirit resides in that tree. Things go awry when a bunch of students die in unusual and inexplicable ways. The protagonist, Shantanu, too faces the wrath of the spirit when he breaks down before the tree and reprimands it for not listening to his prayers as his love interest takes off on a motorbike with another boy.\nAnd when this spirit comes to power, several students start hallucinating and get seizures. As all of this upsets the apple cart, the faculty and the management decide to call for a meeting. Unable to find answers, they reach out to an old student, Krishna Tripathi, who calls himself Baba and is now a ‘para-physicist’. It’s rather interesting how Baba is introduced in the film. He’s seen fighting piśāca-like creatures in what looks like a shoddy VFX-heavy film shot against a green screen. His lackey, in fact, cautions him that this is no Naagin shoot. Interestingly, he uses guns to shoot down spirits. He also wears an energy detector on his wrist.\nSo, this spirit named Mohabbat – who never found true love and suffered due to a betrayal – falls in love with Shantanu. And his closeness to his female friend, Ananya, makes her jealous. That’s when her evil side comes to the core. She starts controlling Ananya. One day, she decides to tell Shantanu the truth about who she really is and when he’s unwilling to believe her, she takes the form of a supernatural entity with green eyes and veins. Baba comes to the rescue and tries to send her back to the underworld.\nAt 2 hours 10 minutes, The Bhootnii appears too long-drawn. A lot of time is wasted through the first half and when it’s time for the interval, you’ll realise that no real plot progression has happened. The makers resort to oodles of physical comedy, which, in all honesty, is jarring, to say the least. Shantanu has two best friends (played by Nick and Aasif Khan) and while they try to make do with the material available to them, a poorly written script doesn’t help them soar. Instead, who soars (literally) are Mohabbat and Shantanu much like those piśāca-like creatures.\nWe don’t encourage drinking but there’s an interesting game that you can play while watching The Bhootnii. Every time the words ‘mohabbat’ and ‘rooh’ are uttered, you take a sip from your fancy Stanley Cups (let’s face it, no one will let you carry glasses inside a theatre). We can assure you that the spirit will eventually let you to enjoy this tale of a spirit. On a different note, the writer packs the screenplay with many ‘jokes’ – some of which are references to Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal and one of which is borrowed from Munna Bhai’s ‘agle din apne mohalle mein Hema aayi’.\nAnd speaking of Ranbir, there’s a flashback sequence in The Bhootnii where we see a young Sanjay Dutt. It will definitely make you think that the makers should have rather considered superimposing Ranbir as a young Sanjay from Sanju. Much like bad jokes, The Bhootnii is filled with aerial shots, which do nothing to elevate the drama. As for St Vincent College of Art and Culture, it’s a unique place because students never study there. They spend their time looking at and thinking about The Virgin Tree and whiling their time away at the college café adorned with neon lights.\nThe saddest part is that the funny dialogues don’t evoke any laughter and the ones that aren’t meant to be funny make you crack up. It’s also packaged with a bunch of forgettable songs that don’t render anything to the narrative. As for the performances, Nick in his debut acting outing, decides to fully play to the gallery. His histrionics are difficult to watch. Who makes up for him is Aasif. Even in a loud and noisy horror-comedy, he manages to leave a mark. His comic timing is relatively mellowed and he genuinely evokes a few laughs. This is an actor worth looking out for!\nSunny Singh as Shantanu appears to be someone who isn’t completely convinced with the script but still decides to go with it. There are moments when he’s extremely loud and at other places, he’s disinterested. His chemistry with Palak Tiwari’s Ananya fails to strike a chord either. There’s a scene when they have an altercation as a prelude to their confessions of love for each other. It’s painful to watch. As for Palak, this script is hardly a parameter to her understand her talent. However, she needs to be given a benefit of doubt for being as confused as Sunny and not completely getting a grasp on the tonality of the script.\nIt’s Mouni, however, who, in a way, shoulders the show. Once again, she plays a supernatural entity (no, not Naagin) and though this is home ground for her, she deserves a story and a script that helps her push the envelope. She manages to hold your attention (for good or for bad, but attention is attention) even when you feel your hope slipping away from the film. Her Mohabbat is no Junoon from Brahmastra: Part One – Shiva, but she truly is convincing.\nBut what’s truly sad is that the film doesn’t do justice to Sanjay. This is a man with an impeccable comic timing but even he’s dealt with a deck of poorly written one-liners. For an actor of his stature, who we rarely get to watch on the big screen, he deserves bigger and better. However, his signature swag is still very much a part of The Bhootnii. His towering presence makes him the perfect fit for Baba, who can go against the natural order and crush any spirit to dust – sometimes with a gun and sometimes with love. We wish there was a little more backstory when it comes to Sanjay’s Baba.\nWhat becomes a redemption of sorts is the last sequence where the climax unfolds. It bears the right kind of energy, treatment and texture, and adds a lot of gravitas to both Baba and Mohabbat. All in all, The Bhootnii is a reminder to filmmakers to stop underestimating the audience. For a horror-comedy to lack both is unforgivable. Even the jump scares are made to look diluted, thanks to the juddering noise and tonality of the film. Feel free to give this film a miss and if you miss Sanjay Dutt, you better go watch Munna Bhai MBBS and Lage Raho Munna Bhai for the umpteenth time.\nHollywood, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and\nregional cinema,\nmovie reviewsand K-dramas,\nweb series, Download the\nNews18 Appto stay updated!\n- Location :\n- First Published:",

    "text": "Featured General Articles Other News Other Religions Uk Why Christianity “is declining in the UK”? May 24, 2024 | 12:43 PM May 24, 2024 | 2:04 PM 0 Shafaqna English- In a country where the resounding hymns of ancient cathedrals once filled the air, Christianity appears to be quietly receding into the background. Here’s a whimsical exploration of why this time-honored tradition might be losing its foothold in the British Isles.\nSunday Shopping: Rather than sitting in pews, many opt for the aisles of their favorite stores, with retail therapy rivaling divine services. Digital Distractions: In an era of smartphones and tablets, Bible apps compete with the allure of TikTok and Instagram for attention. The Rise of Secularism: An increasing number of individuals identify as “nones,” eschewing religious affiliation for a secular worldview. Busy Lives: Balancing work, social engagements, and binge-watching the latest series leaves little time for church. Scientific Skepticism: Growing trust in science prompts questioning of biblical narratives based on empirical evidence. Cultural Shifts: Evolving societal norms can render traditional Christian teachings discordant with contemporary values. Educational Influence: Higher education fosters critical thinking and exposure to diverse beliefs, often leading away from childhood faith. The Scandals: Regrettably, scandals within the church have undermined trust and credibility. The Quest for Authenticity: Younger generations crave genuine experiences, sometimes finding traditional services lacking. Interfaith Relationships: Love transcends religious boundaries, resulting in more secular unions and beliefs. The Internet: With limitless information at their fingertips, people explore a breadth of beliefs and philosophies. Celebrity Secularists: Influential figures openly discussing their lack of faith can sway public opinion. Alternative Spiritualities: From yoga to mindfulness, alternative practices offer spiritual fulfillment beyond the church. Church’s Historical Baggage: Past controversies have left some wary of organized religion’s role. Immigration and Diversity: A diverse population introduces a spectrum of faiths and beliefs, diminishing Christianity’s dominance. Political Entanglements: Christianity’s perceived alignment with certain political agendas can deter potential adherents. Declining Birth Rates: Fewer families mean fewer children raised within the faith. Changing Community Role: Once a cornerstone of community life, the church adapts as community dynamics evolve.

Hubo 37 de este tipo de admisiones en 2021-2022, 40 en 2022-2023 y 51 en 2023-2024.\nHa habido 280 hospitalizaciones con trastornos relacionados con el vapeo en todos los grupos de edad de marzo a octubre de este año, frente a 177 en todo el 2020/21.\nCon información de: DailyMail.\n[TAMBIÉN TE PODRÍA INTERESAR: Sonrixs podría perder la movilidad de su mano tras un accidente jugando vencidas](https://www.record.com.mx/contra/sonrixs-podria-perder-la-movilidad-de-su-mano-tras-un-accidente-jugando-vencidas)",
