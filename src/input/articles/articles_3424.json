    "title": "Eight-point verdict: the end of Zelensky is coming – 2024-08-23 00:27:10",
    "text": "/ world today news/ The fiasco of Zelensky’s visit to Europe showed that they are tired of the war in Ukraine and are afraid of its escalation, including a nuclear one. The failure of the VSU counter-offensive and especially Prigozhin’s rebellion made unquestionable demands from the West (which had almost exhausted its options to help Ukraine) to Kiev to accept the loss of territories and end the conflict with Russia.\nAs “compensation”, Ukraine will perhaps be offered semi-membership in NATO and the EU, which does not oblige the Westerners with anything, but Ukraine will finally become a colony. However, its role as a gun to Russia’s temple will not go anywhere, and Moscow will have to repeat what did not work out now.\nThey are tired of Ukraine not only in Europe. The leaders of 33 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean forced the European Union to cancel the invitation to Volodymyr Zelensky for the EU-Latin America summit, which will be held in Brussels on July 17-18. Moreover, they deleted from the draft of the meeting’s final declaration prepared by the EU’s external service, “all points related to support for Ukraine”. For this “ treason” the Brussels portal EURACTIV reported on Thursday, citing diplomatic sources.\nBut it’s a failure\nThe welcoming of Vladimir Zelensky in Bulgaria also speaks of the degree of fatigue with Ukraine. He, in his theatrical attire and image, as if crawling out of the trenches and holding the front on his shoulders, arrived in Sofia on a Bulgarian government plane from Moldova. In fact, there was no reception. The airport was empty. Zelensky was greeted in splendid isolation only by the Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister Maria Gabriel, who is taller than him.\nThen Zelensky’s motorcade was anathematized by a Bulgarian priest who knew about his arrival, which was kept secret. I do not doubt the sincerity of the feelings of the cursing president of Ukraine and the priest who threatened him with the cross. However, it is hard to shake the feeling that the incident was staged. Everything was filmed on several cameras, which were said to be on hand at once.\nThe video was immediately posted online. And four large policemen on a deserted alley in the pouring rain were already painfully theatrically fussing around and allegedly could not do anything with the church minister who had lost his temper, who was shouting: “Anathema, Zelensky! Anathema, Satanists!”.\nAt the same time, the Bulgarian authorities did not do another, becoming traditional action – to organize a rally of refugees in support of Zelensky, although there are enough Ukrainians who have moved to Bulgaria and many of them would not give up additional income.\nThis is how one of the Ukrainian Telegram channels “Legitimny”, critical of their government, commented on this trip:\nUniversal love passed quickly, now Ze is waiting for a cold shower. It didn’t go without the Americans, who also gently show Ze his place. Sitting at the table to play with the crooks of the world, know that in the end they will “bring you down”, but first they will convince you that you are “cool” in order to raise you as high as possible.\nThe presidential “turn”\nThe West’s verdict on Zelensky and his regime was announced during the negotiations with the Ukrainian guest by Bulgarian President Rumen Radev. His speech was widely quoted in our media, so I will only dwell on his main points.\nFirst Bulgaria has nothing against having Ukraine one day “its place ” in the EU (from the context it is clear that it will be somewhere in the cache).\nSecond instead of the words “victory” we want to “hear more the word “peace”, the main efforts “must be aimed at achieving peace”.\nIn third place according to Bulgaria, Ukraine, along with the West, “does not now use all means of diplomacy to work in this direction, so as not to deepen the conflict”.\nFourth the Ukrainian war “acquires new dimensions” that “have long gone beyond the borders of Ukraine”.\nFifth there is “risk of radioactive contamination”, “in Bulgaria we still bear the consequences of Chernobyl, this is an extremely important issue that affects not only Bulgaria, but the whole of Europe”.\nSixth the war in Ukraine has negative economic, social and political consequences for Europe. It’s about “inflation, growing recession, increasing social tension” as well as the strengthening of “populism” and “radicalization” of political life.\nSeventh , “we have to think not only about Ukraine”, but also about “the future of Europe as a whole”, “how this war will affect Europe”.\nEighth Kiev should not ignore the interests of Europe, as its support is “extremely important” both in the matter of waging the war and in the matter of “recovery”.\nAt the same time, Radev, who is also the supreme commander, frankly told Zelensky that he was against the transfer of arms and ammunition stocks from the Bulgarian army reserve in Kiev, as he did not want the country’s defense capability to be weakened. . He stressed that the Ukrainian conflict has no military solution.\nBulgarian tricks\nOf course, with Bulgarians, not everything is so simple. Their Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov was more complimentary to Zelensky than the president. It is clear that the Bulgarians will not overtake the American “father”, and the countries also discussed the activation of cooperation in the military sphere. In particular, Denkov signed a declaration stating Sofia’s support for Ukraine’s membership in NATO.\n“Bulgaria has already become the 22nd country that supports the Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. This is very important “, Zelensky boasted. And yet the overall impression of his reception in Sofia gives a clear signal: enough, stop! Both the opposition and the majority of the Bulgarian people insist on this.\nIn the Czech Republic… the same\nIn the Russophobic Czech Republic, Zelensky was better received, but there are nuances. The Czech president, retired NATO general Petr Pavel, assured his Ukrainian counterpart that Kiev could “to continue counting” of Prague’s support in the war with Russia. Pavel boasted that his country provided the Ukrainians with about 2 billion euros and a lot of military equipment – 676 ​​units of heavy equipment and air defense systems, 4.2 million pieces of medium-caliber and large-caliber ammunition.\nThis means that the Czech military warehouses are empty. In addition, it became clear from the president’s words that at the NATO summit in July, Ukraine will not be accepted into the alliance, and Prague’s share of half a billion euros, which will be allocated to Kyiv in Vilnius, will be only 5 million.\nPavel only hopes that after the results of the meeting in Vilnius, the level of cooperation between NATO and Ukraine will increase and that “ when the war is over,” “Czech Republic will try to get Ukraine to start EU accession talks before the end of this year.”\nIn short, the president of the Czech Republic, a country on which Ukraine’s prospects do not in the least depend, also called on Zelensky to end the war – in the name of the “carrot” of EU membership, it is not clear when and in what capacity.\nAs for NATO, Zelensky himself admitted to journalists: some of the member countries do not support his country’s participation in this bloc because they are afraid of the Russians. Speaking about the summit in Vilnius, where he promised not to attend unless Ukraine is invited to join NATO, Zelensky, according to TASS, said:\nIt can be difficult to get the unified support of all alliance partners. Someone is looking back at Moscow, they are afraid of Russia, although I think this is a great chance to show the courage and strength of the union.\nWhat of this?\nWell, that’s all – we’ve arrived. There will be no full-fledged EU and NATO for Ukraine. All this trip around Europe, including Istanbul, where on Friday Zelensky met with “our friend Rexep” (who has his own deal with Kiev, mostly grain), and was undertaken only to not go to Vilnius in a few days to disgrace yourself.\nHowever, Zelensky’s European trip showed something terrible for Kiev: The West, led by the United States and represented by its European vassals, is withdrawing from Ukraine because it has lost faith in the possibility of defeating Russia, despite the rivers of Ukrainian blood spilled to do so.\nThis means that serious negotiations with Moscow will begin in the fall to “freeze” the conflict, as warned by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, who is on the subject. And then, after the deal is done, the two countries, who do not trust each other, will continue to seriously prepare to bring the war to an end on the battlefield called Ukraine.\nTranslation: ES\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel in Telegram:\nShare on your profiles, with friends, in groups and on pages.

    "text": "Na manhã de hoje, os fiéis deixaram o centro da cidade e se dirigiram a uma grande praça localizada cinco quilômetros ao norte, onde astros brasileiros do gospel fizeram um show durante toda a tarde. \"Isso é uma experiência! Quando a gente vem uma vez, não deixa mais de vir\", disse a pastora Gislene Alves, 60. A empresária Raimunda Gonçalves da Silva, 29, compareceu para rezar \"pelas pessoas necessitadas, pelo Rio Grande do Sul e por Israel também\". Lula não participou da Marcha, mas enviou um representante do governo, e a presidência divulgou uma mensagem em seu nome: \"Como cristão, sinto-me regozijado de ver a dimensão extraordinária que esse evento tomou e o papel significativo que ele desempenha na vida de muitos brasileiros.\" O prefeito de direita de São Paulo, Ricardo Nunes, que buscará um novo mandato nas eleições de outubro, dirigiu-se aos fiéis: “Que essa marcha possa sair daqui para entrar em muitas casas. Estou muito feliz por estar aqui, eu amo Jesus Cristo, amo vocês\", disse o aliado de Bolsonaro.Os brasileiros evangélicos representam cerca de um terço dos 203 milhões de habitantes do país, mas alguns líderes religiosos afirmam que eles serão a maioria dentro de dez anos.",

The Pope remains hospitalized, with his condition described as serious but stable.\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni provided an early morning update stating that the Pope had a restful night. However, doctors caution that sepsis, a severe infection of the blood, poses a significant threat given Francis's age and medical history. The 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to Gemelli hospital on February 14 after his bronchitis worsened.\nDr. Sergio Alfieri, head of medicine and surgery at Gemelli hospital, explained the risk of germs entering the bloodstream. Meanwhile, the Vatican continues its Holy Year activities, with deacons attending a special Jubilee weekend. The Pope is expected to miss his upcoming engagements as his recovery progresses.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "Tribunales Un mosso recurre ante el Supremo la amnistía de un independentista condenado por lesionarlo en Barcelona El TSJC amnistió al condenado que lanzó piedras contra una furgoneta policial y luego rompió el peroné al agente Germán González / J. G. Albalat Los tribunales tendrán la última palabra de la [ley de amnistía](/tags/ley-de-amnistia/), pero no solo para concederlas sino también para revocarlas. Es lo que pide un agente de los [Mossos d'Esquadra](/tags/mossos-d-esquadra/), representado por el sindicato Uspac, que ha presentado un recurso ante el [Tribunal Supremo](/tags/tribunal-supremo/) para que deje sin efecto la amnistía concedida por el Tribunal Superior de Justícia de Catalunya a un hombre condenado por la Audiencia de Barcelona a tres años y medio de prisión por los delitos de lesiones y atentado a la autoridad. La sentencia también establecía que debía indemnizar al agente con 76.647 euros, ya que se rompió el peroné cuando detuvo al sospechoso. Sin embargo, la amnistía deja sin efecto también esta indemnización, pese a que abre la puerta a una reclamación por la vía civil. Pese a esto, el mosso, representado por al abogado José Antonio Bitos, ha recurrido al Supremo al considerar que el delito de lesiones está fuera de la ley de amnistía. El 1 de octubre del 2020 en una manifestación de la Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) y Òmnium Cultural por el tercer aniversario del Referéndum, tres vecinos de Granollers lanzaron piedras contra al menos una furgoneta antidisturbios de los Mossos, que estaba en marcha con agentes dentro. Así lo indicaba la sentencia de la Audiencia de Barcelona ahora revocada. Los sospechosos fueron perseguidos por los Mossos y uno de ellos, M., \"embistió\" al policía lesionado provocándole la rotura del peroné tras caer al suelo. Desde la Uspac han indicado que no descartan acudir al Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos (TEDH) si el Supremo no atiende a sus demandas. ",

    "text": "女排世联赛首周比赛结束后，各支队伍都开始转战第二周的比赛地。相较于首周各大主力休战，随着主力们的回归第二周的竞争程度会更加激烈。根据巴西排协的消息，巴西头号球星加比已经回归，将随队参加伊斯坦布尔站的比赛。\n首周，吉马良斯只带了3名主攻，分别是海伦娜、伯格曼、克里斯蒂娜。虽然伯格曼和克里斯蒂娜发挥不错，但她们的实力和加比还是有着很大的差距，不管是进攻端还是后排保障环节，加比都是巴西女排的灵魂人物。\n按照赛程，巴西将在第二周依次对阵比利时、加拿大、多米尼加和土耳其。里约战的4场球，巴西队收获了3胜1负的战绩，只输给了世界第一意大利，暂时排在积分榜第五。就第二周的四场比赛来看，除了土耳其队实力不俗外，其余3支队伍比利时、加拿大和多米尼加应该对她们构不成任何威胁。\n当巴西找回加比加强队伍实力的同时，加拿大女排则是遭遇人员荒，接应范赖克决定将不再参加今年世界女排联赛剩余的比赛，主二传布里金在上场比赛中脚踝受伤，也可能将缺席剩余的比赛。目前，两名球员都没有随队抵达伊斯坦布尔，也就是说第二周赛事将不会出现她俩的身影。\n范赖克和布里金对于加拿大的重要性不亚于加比对于巴西女排的重要性，没有她俩加拿大队的整体实力将会出现严重的下滑。加拿大首周拿到了2胜2负的战绩，以小分劣势排在第11位，距离参加总决赛仅一步之遥。但随着两名主力的缺阵，新帅古德蒂将接受严峻的考验。\n加拿大将在第二周对阵韩国、土耳其、巴西和比利时。4支队伍里，加拿大拿下韩国和比利时问题不大，战胜土耳其和巴西难度颇大。另外，作为分站赛东道主的土耳其队将在第二周启用最强阵容，队中众多主力都会陆续归队参赛。\n奥运冠军意大利女排则是继续沿用首周的全主力阵容，埃格努、塞拉、安特罗波娃等球员继续前往香港参赛。第二周，意大利对手是保加利亚、泰国、日本和中国，除了首个对手不是亚洲球队外，剩余3个都是亚洲队伍。意大利的目标很明确，那就是争取全胜。",

    "title": "Flutterwave Launches Send App in Ghana to Streamline Global Remittances",
    "text": "African fintech giant Flutterwave has expanded its cross-border payment services to Ghana with the launch of its Send App, enabling individuals and businesses to receive international money transfers directly into bank accounts or mobile money wallets.\nThe platform, now live in the West African nation, supports transactions via MTN Mobile Money, Telecel Cash, and AirtelTigo Money, positioning Ghana as the latest hub for Flutterwave’s mission to bridge Africa’s financial connectivity gaps.\nThe app aims to simplify remittances for critical needs such as family support, education fees, and business operations while offering competitive transaction fees. Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola described the move as a “major leap forward” in linking African economies to global markets. “Secure, seamless transactions drive economic transformation,” he said, emphasizing the app’s role in reducing barriers to international payments.\nSecurity remains a cornerstone of the service, with Send App holding PCI-DSS Level 1 certification—the highest standard in payment security—to encrypt transactions and guard against fraud. Senior Product Manager Temiloluwa Adesina highlighted the company’s focus on innovation, stating the launch reflects Flutterwave’s commitment to “making cross-border transactions simple and efficient.”\nThe rollout comes as remittances to Ghana continue to play a vital role in household incomes and business liquidity. In 2023, the World Bank reported that remittance inflows to sub-Saharan Africa reached $54 billion, underscoring the demand for reliable transfer solutions. Analysts say Flutterwave’s entry could intensify competition in Ghana’s fintech sector, dominated by players like Wave and Mama Money.\nWith the Send App launch, Flutterwave strengthens its foothold in a region where mobile money adoption is surging. Over 60% of Ghana’s adult population uses mobile wallets, according to central bank data, signaling ripe conditions for digital payment growth. The company, which processes over 400 million transactions annually across 34 African countries, now eyes further expansion to deepen its pan-African financial network.\n“This isn’t just about moving money,” Agboola added. “It’s about ensuring Africans can participate fully in the global economy.” As digital remittance markets evolve, Flutterwave’s push into Ghana tests its capacity to balance scale with security in one of Africa’s most dynamic fintech landscapes.",
