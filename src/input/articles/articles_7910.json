    "title": "DeepSeek次代R2模型延宕原因曝 FT：跟華為有關",
    "text": "MoneyDJ新聞 2025-08-14 13:41:28 郭妍希 發佈市場謠傳，中國AI新創DeepSeek的次世代AI模型「R2」之所以無法如期於5月發布，主要跟使用華為「Ascend」系列處理器進行訓練有關。 英國金融時報(FT) 14日引述未具名消息人士報導，DeepSeek 1月發表AI模型「R1」後，當局鼓勵其採用華為Ascend而非輝達(Nvidia Corp.)系統來訓練R2。然而，持續發生的技術問題，仍促使DeepSeek改以輝達晶片訓練模型，而華為晶片則僅作AI推論任務之用。這些問題是R2無法如期於5月發布的主因。 業內人士透露，跟輝達產品相比，華為晶片面臨穩定性問題，不但晶片間互聯(inter-chip connectivity)速度較慢，軟體效能也屈居劣勢。 據兩名消息人士說法，華為派了一組工程師進駐DeepSeek辦公室，助其使用旗下AI晶片開發R2。然而，即便有工程團隊駐點，DeepSeek依舊無法成功以Ascend訓練模型。DeepSeek還在跟華為想辦法，看要如何讓R2模型跟Ascend處理器相容，以完成AI推論任務。 此外，根據消息，數據標記(data labelling)耗費的時間比預期久，也是R2延宕的原因。據陸媒報導，R2最快再過幾週就有望問世。 市場日前才剛傳出，中國當局呼籲當地企業避免使用輝達的「H20」繪圖處理器(GPU)，尤其是在涉及政府相關的用途之際。除了輝達外，北京當局推行的政策，也對超微(AMD)的AI處理器造成影響，但不清楚是否有任何函件提及AMD的「MI308」。 北京當局才剛召見輝達代表，討論美國的定位追蹤技術以及據信跟H20晶片有關的安全風險。輝達安全長David Reber 8月5日透過官方部落格回應中國指控H20有「後門」安全風險的疑慮，直指輝達GPU並未內建緊急停止開關(kill switch)或後門。 (圖片來源：shutterstock) ＊編者按：本文僅供參考之用，並不構成要約、招攬或邀請、誘使、任何不論種類或形式之申述或訂立任何建議及推薦，讀者務請 運用個人獨立思考能力，自行作出投資決定，如因相關建議招 致損失，概與《精實財經媒體》、編者及作者無涉。",

    "title": "UN Secretary-General Calls for Ban on Fossil Fuel Advertising, Says Next 18 Months Are Critical for Climate Action",
    "text": "NEW YORK — At a special address on climate action on Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for the world’s governments, news media and tech companies to ban advertising from fossil fuel companies in light of the industry’s continued greenwashing of its role in perpetuating the climate crisis.\nThe explicit call for a global ban on fossil fuel advertising was a first for Guterres, whose special address also echoed his consistent advocacy for an urgent, global transition off of oil, gas and coal and increased mitigation of the disproportionate impacts of climate change on the world’s most vulnerable populations.\n“Climate change is the mother of all stealth taxes paid by everyday people and vulnerable countries and communities,” Guterres said in his address, delivered on the United Nations’ World Environment Day at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. “Meanwhile, the godfathers of climate chaos—the fossil fuel industry—rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies.”\n Comparing the fossil fuel industry to the tobacco industry, Guterres also called on public relations and advertising firms to “stop acting as enablers to planetary destruction,” by dropping fossil fuel clients from their rosters.\n“Billions of dollars have been thrown at distorting the truth, deceiving the public and sowing doubt,” Guterres said. “Many in the fossil fuel industry have shamelessly greenwashed, even as they have sought to delay climate action with lobbying, legal threats,and massive ad campaigns.”\nThe address comes a month after the hearing held by U.S. Senate Democrats scrutinizing Big Oil’s decades of denial and misinformation, which reiterated past evidence that the fossil fuel industry deliberately misled the public in order to continue profiting off of petroleum products, despite their heating of the climate, and called for a Department of Justice investigation.\nThe special address was introduced by former NYC mayor and media mogul Michael Bloomberg, who is the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions. At the event, he reaffirmed Bloomberg Philanthropies’ commitment to the UN’s climate agenda over the next 18 months. But Bloomberg’s involvement also highlights the complex challenges media companies will face if they choose to step up to Guterres’s challenge.\nAn investigation last year from Drilled and DeSmog listed Bloomberg’s news venture among a long list of major news companies connected with brand studios that create advertising content for oil and gas companies, citing a video by Bloomberg Media Studios and Exxon Mobil on carbon capture and storage that featured ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods. Bloomberg has said such advertorial content is separate from its editorial content.\nGuterres also highlighted a new annual report from the World Meteorological Organization, which predicts that global temperatures will likely continue to reach record levels during the next five years. The report identified an 80 percent chance that in the next five years, at least one year’s global average temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming since industrialization—a limit nations that signed the Paris Agreement committed to avoid breaking—and an 86 percent chance that at least one of those years will beat 2023 to be the hottest year on record .\n2023’s average temperature already surpassed the 1.5 degree threshold, as have the past 11 months straight . Despite these dire milestones, public understanding of how quickly the Earth is warming continues to lag, leading some climate scientists and experts to question the utility of focusing communications on the 1.5 degree benchmark, or allowing fossil fuel companies to advertise the products driving global warming.\n“There’s absolutely no way humanity is going to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of global heating at this point,” said climate scientist Peter Kalmus. “The only question is, how much longer are we going to let sociopath executives destroy life on Earth and increasingly threaten billions of lives for their profit. Every increment of heating is worth fighting to stop, because every increment of heating will further damage habitability and kill more humans and other beings.”\nCalling his address “a moment of truth,” Guterres said the next 18 months will be “climate crunch time”—a crucial window for global actors to ramp up restrictions on fossil fuels and investments in renewable energy.\nGuterres also emphasized the financial pragmatism of climate action, calling for just and scalable levies on shipping, aviation and fossil fuel extraction sectors to help fund climate action, and advocating for financial institutions to redefine their evaluations of the risks involved with climate change.\n“None of this is charity,” he said. “It is enlightened self-interest.”\n Pointing out that the oil and gas industry invested just 2.5 percent of its total capital spending in renewable energy, he also called on fossil fuel companies to use their “massive profits” to lead the clean energy transition.\n“Doubling down on fossil fuels in the twenty-first century is like doubling down on horse-shoes and carriage-wheels in the nineteenth,” he said.\nGuterres ended his speech by thanking activists, civil society, businesses and governments that have been leading the charge on the clean energy transition, and calling on world leaders to choose a side.\n“It’s We the Peoples versus the polluters and the profiteers,” Guterres said. “It’s time for leaders to decide whose side they’re on. Tomorrow, it will be too late.”\nShare this article\nKeerti Gopal Reporter, Activism Keerti Gopal is a New York City-based reporter covering activism and grassroots mobilization in the climate movement.

    "title": "CS Lewis Christmas Sermon Offers Surprisingly Accurate Predictions",
    "text": "CS Lewis, most famous for his popular children’s series, The Chronicles of Narnia, made the rounds online this past week with his “\nA Christmas Sermon for Pagans” making an appearance in preparation for the Christmas season. Prior to being a beloved children’s author, Lewis was a renowned Christian thinker and apologist, with his radio talks during World War II, which would later be compiled into his book Mere Christianity, catapulting him into the public eye. Lewis’s “Christmas Sermon” is lesser known than Mere Christianity and was published in the UK magazine The Strand in 1946, just after World War II.\nWhat has brought the sermon’s recent interest is its surprisingly prescient warnings to a post-truth generation. Lewis was writing at a time of extreme disillusionment- the carnage of World War I had left Europe with millions of dead men and the realities of the depravity of humanity. Then, less than a generation later, “the war to end all wars” was followed up by World War II. The world was in shock, and faith seemed to be the first casualty. “I know that people keep on telling us that our country is relapsing into Paganism. But they only mean it is ceasing to be Christian,” Lewis wrote. He then went on to explain that pagans were pre-Christian while he was finding himself living in a society that was seemingly post-Christian. “To say that modern people who have drifted away from Christianity are Pagans is to suggest that a post-Christian man is the same as a pre-Christian man. And that is like thinking a woman who has lost her husband is the same sort of person as an unmarried girl…”\nLewis noted that the Pagan, albeit pre-Christian, was still religious, giving him a sense of right and wrong. “When he asked himself what is wrong with the world, he did not immediately reply ‘the system,’ or ‘our allies,’ or ‘education.’ It occurred to him that he himself might be one of the things that was wrong with the world. He knew he had sinned.” The post-Christian, however, saw things differently. “There is no objective Right or Wrong: each race or class can invent its own code or ‘ideology’ just as it pleases. And whatever may be amiss with the world, it certainly is not we, not the ordinary people; it is up to God (if, after all, He should happen to exist), or to Government, or to Education, to give us what we want. They are the shop, we are the customers: and ‘the customer is always right,'” Lewis wrote of the post-Christian man. He doubted, however, that this new view of life was any better and certainly not true. “As for the ideologies, the newly invented Wrongs and Rights, does no one see the catch? If there is no real Wrong and Right, nothing good or bad in itself, none of these ideologies can be better or worse than another…. If there is no objective standard, then our choice between one ideology and another becomes a matter of arbitrary taste. Our battle for democratic ideals against Nazi ideals has been a waste of time because the one is no better than the other,” he wrote.\nHe then offered that if the post-Christian view was wrong, that left three possibilities for people- people who were sick and didn’t know it (post-Christians), the Pagans who are sick and know it but have no cure, and those “who have found the cure.” He argued that in order for post-Christians to regain their Christianity, they would need to first become Pagans again, willing to recognize their own sickness rather than deny it or be unaware of it. “For (in a sense) all that Christianity adds to Paganism is the cure. It confirms the old belief that in this universe, we are up against Living Power: that there is a real Right and that we have failed to obey it, that existence is beautiful and terrifying. It adds a wonder of which Paganism had not distinctly heard—that the Mighty One has come down to help us, to remove our guilt, to reconcile us,” he added. He encouraged his readers to partake in the upcoming “Pagan” festivities of Christmas and “to sing and feast because a God has been born.” “You are uncertain whether it is more than a myth,” wrote Lewis. “Well, if it is, then our last hope is gone. But is the opposite explanation not worth trying?”",

Please take care while reading.\nRapper 50 Cent’s in the true crime game, and his Peacock docuseries\nTikTok Star Murders, set to premiere on June 25, 2024, tells the story of Ali Abulaban, a famous TikToker known as JinnKid, who shot and killed his wife, Ana Abulaban, and suspected lover, Rayburn Barron, in 2021.\nAbulaban started on TikTok in 2019, and before long he had millions of followers enjoying his funny impressions of characters like Skyrim and Scarfare. Ana, meanwhile, often appeared in his videos,\nPeople reported. Looks were deceiving, though. Ana and Ali’s marriage fell apart, and only about a month before she died, she accused Ali of domestic violence in a police report.\nBy October 2021, Ali and Ana, who had a five-year-old daughter, were living apart, but Ali had placed a listening device on his daughter’s iPad and thought he had heard Ana, 28, talking with another man, Rayburn Barron, 29. Enraged, Ali went to Ana’s Southern California apartment found both of them there, and shot and killed them. Ali later said he was on cocaine at the time and he “snapped.”\n“Before I could stop myself I just f***ing snapped. My gun was in my hand and next thing I’m shooting and I can’t stop. I’m just shooting. I’m shooting. I’m even startled. I’m like I’m in the passenger seat of my own body. I can’t stop it,”\nAbulaban told the jury.\nAli Abulaban called his mother just moments after the murders happened\nAli called his mom, Dalal Warra, only moments after the murders happened and told her what he’d done, Warra said at her son’s trial. She didn’t believe him at first, but he texted her a picture of the bodies. “I deleted it right away. I hung up the phone and I literally fell on the ground,” Warra said on the stand, according to Southern California news outlet\nCBS8. In the immediate aftermath, Ali also searched for information online about how to dispose of a body, according to the prosecution. Later that day, he picked up his daughter from school and told her he “ hurt mommy.”\nThree years after Ana and Barron died, in May 2024, Abulaban was found guilty of Ana Abulaban and Rayburn Barron’s double murder. Abulaban, 32, is set to be sentenced on June 28, 2024, three days after 50 Cent’s Abulaban docuseries premieres on Peacock. He could face life in prison.\nIf you are experiencing domestic abuse, or if you believe someone you know is being abused, contact\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline. The hotline can be reached at 1-800-799-SAFE or spoken with online via the hotline’s website. Mobile phone owners can also text “START” to the number 88788. ",

    "title": "Buccaneers: Kyler Murray drops hyped Baker Mayfield message after Tampa Bay win",
    "text": "There will be a new NFC champion in 2024 after Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 32-9 win over Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles at home Monday night. The playoff victory by the Bucs was a continuation of the dramatic resurgence of Mayfield, who, at one point in the past, looked as though his time in the NFL was over. Mayfield’s story in the NFL has captivated many people, among them is no other than his former Oklahoma football teammate and current Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray. After the Buccaneers dethroned the Eagles as NFC champs, Murray hopped on social media and posted a short but meaningful Baker Mayfield shoutout. LFG Bake.. — Kyler Murray (@K1) January 16, 2024 Mayfield outplayed Hurts in a showdown between former Sooners talents, as he recorded 337 passing yards and three touchdowns with zero interceptions while going 22/36 on his throws. Hurts, on the other hand, went 25/35 for 250 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception. The Buccaneers took a chance on Mayfield to be the team’s starting quarterback following the retirement of Tom Brady. The Bucs signed him to a one-year deal worth $4 million back in March and could be looking to offer him a hefty extension, considering how effective he’s been at orchestrating Tampa Bay’s attack that concluded the 2023 NFL regular season averaging 21.1 points per game. In his first season with the Bucs, Mayfield had 4,044 passing yards and 28 touchdowns against 10 interceptions. Mayfield can continue adding to his success with the Buccaneers in the divisional round when Tampa Bay visits Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions.",
