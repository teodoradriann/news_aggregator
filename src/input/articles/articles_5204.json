    "text": "AUSTRALIAN LAMB CONQUERS THE GENERATION GAP IN LATEST SUMMER CAMPAIGN VIA THE MONKEYS [No Comments](#comments)\nAustralian Lamb is back. This year, the hotly anticipated summer campaign is skewering the generation gap that continues to divide the nation.\nCreated by The Monkeys, part of Accenture Song, and co-directed by Aimée-Lee Xu Hsien and Trent O’Donnell – a Millennial and Gen X-er, respectively – the film imagines a world in which the generations have been separated by The Generation Gap: an impassable chasm that keeps each age group away from the others.\nLeft to their own devices, each generation has become the worst version of themselves – until a lamb BBQ appears to remind Australians of all ages that, actually, we have more in common than divides us.\nThe full-length ad premieres during the evening news of Seven and Nine today (7th January), followed by a rollout across free to air and subscription TV nationally. It will be pushed out across TV, online video, catch up TV, paid social and retail OOH channels by UM, with One Green Bean driving reach for the campaign across earned media and owned social.\nFor the first time, One Green Bean will also amplify the campaign via a social-first content piece launching across owned and influencer marketing channels from 15th January. The campaign will also be supported through key retail and butcher channel activation and integration.\nSays Graeme Yardy, Domestic Market Manager at Meat and Livestock Australia: “Pop culture would have us believe that the generations are practically different species. Apparently, Boomers are unable to master the basics of technology whilst Zoomers spend every waking moment making TikTok dances and Millennials spend too much on avo toast and craft beer.\n“But in reality, there’s far more that unites than separates us, and that’s what this year’s Summer Lamb campaign is all about. Whether it’s a love of our sporting heroes or our beautiful landscapes, the best of Australia always brings us together, and what better way to break down the generational divide than over an epic Aussie lamb BBQ – the ultimate unifier!”\nAdds Scott Dettrick, Creative Director at The Monkeys: “With growing differences in wealth, opinions, and ways of communication, the generation gap in Australia has never been wider. The various frustrations this year have each generation throwing tropes around, looking for someone to blame. When you scratch beneath the surface though, it’s attitudes, not age, that divide us.\n“Maybe if we just got around a lamb BBQ and had a chat, we might find out that grandad is actually pretty cool, or all that stuff millennials know can be really useful. Our entire creative process this year was a fun generational debate, and with multi-generational directors and editors on the films, it was all very method.”\nCreative Agency – The Monkeys, part of Accenture Song\nChief Creative Officer: Tara Ford\nCreative Director: Scott Dettrick\nCreative Team: Jake Ausburn & Alex Polglase\nHead of Production: Penny Brown\nSenior Producer: Elliot Liebermann\nProduction Coordinator: Emily Coleman\nThe Monkeys Group CEO and Co-Founder & Accenture Song ANZ President: Mark Green\nManaging Director: Matt Michael\nBusiness Strategy Director: Kit Lansdell\nHead of Business Management: Topher Jones\nSenior Business Manager: Celine Dinant\nBusiness Executive: Matt Stafford\nProduction Company: Rabbit\nDirectors: Aimée-Lee Xu Hsien & Trent O’Donnell\nMD/Partner/Executive Producer: Alex Hay\nPartner/Executive Producer: Lucas Jenner\nProducer: Morgan Hind\nDoP: Emma Paine\nProduction Design: Virginia Mesiti\nCasting: Citizen Jane Casting\nPost-Production: The Editors\nEdit House: The Editors\nEditors: Grace O’Connell & Stu Morley\nExecutive Producer: Rita Gagliardi\nLead Flame Artist: Stu Cadzow\nVFX Supervisor: Andreas Wanda\nColourist: Greg ‘Elvis’ Constanaras\nMusic & Sound: MassiveMusic\nComposer: Haydn Walker\nSound Designer: Simon Kane\nProducer: Katrina Aquilia\nMedia Agency – UM\nClient Partner: Lauren Thornborough\nSenior Creative Connections Planner: Cayley McArthur\nSenior Planning Manager: Bernadette Banasik\nSenior Partnerships Trader: Joshua Coles\nTrader: Jess Curran\nPR and Social Agency – One Green Bean\nHead of Creative Innovation: Hannah Stalder\nHead of Content: Laura Byrne\nAccount Director, PR: Molly Dodwell\nAccount Director, Social: Amy McCann\nSenior Content Creative: Jack Williams\nContent Creative: Gabi Kearney\nSenior Account Executive: Bridget Patterson\nClient – Meat & Livestock Australia\nGeneral Manager – Marketing and Insights: Nathan Low\nDomestic Market Manager: Graeme Yardy\nBrand Manager: Derek Lau",

    "text": "93-year-old woman charged $450 to change utility bill to her name after husband dies\nAYDEN, N.C. (WITN/Gray News) – A 93-year-old woman says she was charged $450 to change the name on her utility bill to her own after her husband died.\nEleanor Boyd lives in Ayden, North Carolina. She lost her husband in February and wanted to switch the name on her utility account from her husband’s name to hers.\nShe thought she was doing the right thing by putting the bill in her name since her husband was no longer alive. She said the bill would be for the same address; she was simply requesting a name change.\nWhen she went to Ayden Town Hall to ask to make the change, she was told there would be a $450 fee to put her name on the account.\nInitially, she was shocked.\n“I told her, ‘Well, I shouldn’t have even told you.’ And she said, ‘Well, we know now,‘” Boyd said, describing her interaction with the person at the desk.\nBoyd says she was told she couldn’t go back on her request to make the change since they now knew her husband had died, so she would have to foot the bill.\n“They were gonna cut off my lights if I didn’t pay it within 31 days,” she said.\nCity officials said the $450 fee exists to help cover unpaid utility bills from others. The town says even with this fee, it is often not enough to cover unpaid bills, and they have to utilize a state program to help with outstanding balances.\nWhen it comes to the account of a person who has died, the town says that it must absorb any balances on that person’s account if the trustee or spouse does not pay the final bill.\nBoyd says that she and her husband always paid their bills on time, and she’s never received any kind of return deposit from the town following her husband’s passing.\nShe contacted a town commissioner, who got the issue added to the next council meeting’s agenda.\n“When they got the meeting, they tabled it,” Boyd said.\nNow, it’s slated for discussion on April 14.\nBoyd says she’s willing to fight, and she’s not just doing it for herself. While she said she has the money to pay, she worries about those who do not.\n“Even though it would have been a burden to pay $450, I could have paid it. But who else are they doing it to that can’t pay it?” she said.\nAs the clock ticks on the 31 days Boyd was given to make the payment, she knows it may get to the point where her power is shut off – a consequence she’s prepared to face.\n“Everything I’m doing here today is to help myself and others, and I’m just going to go to the limit,” she said.\nWITN reached out to other nearby towns to see if they also require the $450 name-change fee.\nIn Farmville, if the right documentation is provided, the town manager said a name switch like this would be free. Same thing in Grifton – it would also be free.\nIn Bethel, residents making this request are charged $5 for an administrative fee.\nCopyright 2025 WITN via Gray Local Media, Inc.
