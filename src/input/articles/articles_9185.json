    "title": "Harvard settles lawsuit alleging it ignored sexual harassment",
    "text": "By Nate Raymond\nBOSTON (Reuters) – Harvard University has settled a lawsuit accusing the Ivy League school of ignoring sexual harassment by a professor who three graduate students said had threatened their academic careers if they reported him.\nIn a filing on Wednesday in federal court in Boston, the three women – Margaret Czerwienski, Lilia Kilburn and Amulya Mandava – voluntarily dismissed their 2022 lawsuit following months of mediation with Harvard.\nTheir lawsuit gained national attention with its claims that John Comaroff, then an anthropology professor, for years kissed and groped students and threatened to sabotage students’ careers if they complained.\nTerms of the settlement were not disclosed. The law firm that represented the women, Sanford Heisler Sharp, said it was “glad that our clients will now be able to move on with their lives and careers.”\n“We’re proud of our clients’ courage in coming forward, speaking up about their experiences, and shedding light on important issues,” the law firm said in a statement.\nHarvard and Comaroff’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Comaroff, who retired earlier this year, issued a statement on his website in July calling the allegations false.\nWhen the suit was filed, his lawyers said he categorically denied ever harassing or retaliating against any student.\nThe #MeToo-era lawsuit followed an internal Harvard investigation that found Comaroff had engaged in verbal conduct that violated professional conduct and sexual harassment policies.\nThe three women said they were among the students who reported Comaroff to Harvard officials. Despite their warnings, Harvard watched as he retaliated by ensuring the students would have “trouble getting jobs,” the lawsuit said.\nThey said Harvard’s inaction allowed Comaroff to repeatedly and forcibly kiss Kilburn and grope her in public, and claimed he graphically described ways she would be supposedly raped or killed in South Africa for being in a same-sex relationship.\nThe lawsuit alleged Harvard violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects students from discrimination based on sex, and various Massachusetts laws. A judge largely rejected Harvard’s bid to dismiss the case in March 2023.\nComaroff was not a defendant. On his website, he said that as a result of the “fact-free allegations” he had before his retirement become the subject of an “ugly, ferocious campaign” by activists on campus who had occupied his classrooms and pressured students not to take courses with him.\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Howard Goller)",

    "text": "[Health & Fitness](/illinois/chicagoheights/lifestyle) Free Men’s Health Community Seminar at Franciscan Health Olympia Fields hospital to host free seminar discussing a minimally invasive solution for men's urinary issues on Tuesday, November 19 Men struggling with urinary issues due to an enlarged prostate are invited to learn about an innovative, minimally invasive treatment option at a free Franciscan Health Olympia Fields community seminar. The seminar, entitled “PAE: A Minimally Invasive Solution for Men’s Urinary Issues,” will take place Tuesday, November 19, at 6:00 p.m., at the Franciscan Health Olympia Fields Auditorium located at 20201 S. Crawford Ave. Led by interventional radiologist Saud Ahmed, MD, this informative session will provide insights into Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) — a procedure designed to alleviate urinary symptoms by reducing the size of an enlarged prostate. Unlike traditional surgery, PAE is a less invasive option where an interventional radiologist restricts blood flow to the prostate, leading to significant symptom relief with a safer approach. This event not only offers a chance to explore a potential solution but also includes free refreshments and giveaways for attendees. Space is limited, so early reservations are encouraged.
