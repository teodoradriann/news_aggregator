    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "The Federal Court has ruled, The Trudeau government's announcement of the Emergency Measures Act to destroy “freedom convoys” in the winter of 2022 was “inappropriate” and “illegal”. This decision is more than a simple decision. This is a stinging and humiliating blow to liberals and all those who enthusiastically, if not happily, supported his determination to destroy a protest movement. excuses At the beginning of his term, Justin Trudeau demonstrated his extraordinary ease in offering a tearful apology for all the mistakes made by his predecessors. So we would expect him to accept his legal defeat with dignity and apologize for his excesses and his lack of judgment towards the truck drivers whom he unjustly demonized. This would have been the absolute minimum. But it was too much to expect from Trudeau. Since he could not tolerate contradiction, his government immediately announced its intention to appeal the case. It's disrespectful to taxpayers, who will pay the price for this approach, but it's certainly better. Ottawa has used and abused its power to manage civil dissent, and the justice system should be tough on it. By confirming the unconstitutionality of the use of this law, the Supreme Court, on the one hand, will serve a dire warning to future prime ministers who will be tempted to imitate Trudeau in getting rid of dissenting voices. This will restore Canadians' confidence in their institutions! On the other hand, this decision will mandate accountability, punishment of the culprits and compensation for the victims. Because, at the moment, nothing is planned. consequences However, a decision devoid of concrete consequences does more harm than good. By telling elected officials they can break the law with impunity, he invites them to increase the number of criminal acts. Canada is already doing very badly. No need to add more!",

    "title": "Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Jumped 22% in December",
    "text": "Shares of Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD 1.89% ) were surging last month after investors responded positively to the launch of its new Instinct MI300 accelerators designed to run advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. The launch had been long anticipated by investors.\nAMD stock also benefited from broader market gains during the month, partly in response to the Fed's forecast of lower interest rates in 2024. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , the stock gained 22% in December.\nAs you can see from the chart below, AMD spiked 10% on Dec. 7 after its chip presentation and continued to rise from there.\nAMD data by YCharts .\nAMD responds in AI Rival Nvidia has dominated the market thus far for AI chips and components, only increasing the anticipation for the new MI300 and the rest of AMD's new product line. There's a shortage of Nvidia's H100 accelerators and other graphics processing units (GPUs), meaning there's a clear opportunity for AMD to step in.\nAMD said the new MI300X accelerator offers industry-leading memory bandwidth for generative AI and top performance for large language model training and inference. AMD also projected that the new line of chips would generate $2 billion in revenue in 2024, which would significantly boost its data center business.\nThe company also showed off customers, including Microsoft , Meta Platforms , OpenAI, and Oracle , showing a solid customer base for the new product line. Later in the month, there was little company-specific news on AMD, but the stock seemed to benefit from the broader gains in the morning as the Fed forecast lower rates next year.\nAMD also seemed to get a boost from better-than-expected results from Micron , the memory-chip maker considered a bellwether for the broader semiconductor market . Micron reported a return to revenue growth, though it still had a wide loss on the bottom line.\nWhat's next for AMD in 2024 High expectations are baked into AMD's stock after shares more than doubled in 2023, and the $2 billion revenue forecast from the new MI300 shows that alone will only have a modest impact on the company's financial results. The semiconductor sector has been in a slump in the last year or two, and AMD reported just 4% revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but demand for its CPUs seems to be recovering as well.\nGiven the surge in demand for AI chips and the current shortage, AMD should find a niche to fill and remain a popular choice for tech investors.",
