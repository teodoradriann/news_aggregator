    "text": "Elon Musk foresees a multi-trillion dollar market for his humanoid robot, Optimus, by 2030. Another entry in the market is Apollo by Apptronik. Others will follow. The combination of crazy-“smart” AI plus improved dexterity and mobility means the replacement of human labor in manufacturing. Worse, robots will soon be making and repairing themselves. Look for mass production by the end of 2025. ⁃ Patrick Wood, Editor. Cue the self-replicating robot revolution: Apptronik’s humanoid Apollo robot is gearing up to assist in manufacturing copies of itself. That’s thanks to a deal between the Texas-based robotics company and global engineering solutions firm Jabil , which produces components for the likes of Apple, Dell, and HP .\nThe partnership will see both companies put Apollo robots to work on assembly lines at Jabil’s operations, including the ones for manufacturing Apollo bots.\nApollo will have to prove itself capable first, though. It’ll initially be assigned “an array of simple, repetitive intralogistics and manufacturing tasks, including inspection, sorting, kitting, lineside delivery, fixture placement, and sub-assembly.” The idea is for Apollo to eventually be deployed to functioning manufacturing facilities and free up human workers.\nJabil is also set to scale production of Apollo robot production, with the hopes of getting the robot to an attractive price point for Apptronik customers. The humanoid was first unveiled in 2023 , and is set to become commercially available next year.\nMeasuring 5 ft 8 in (173 cm) tall, Apollo can handle payloads of up to 55 lb (25 kg) and operate for four hours on a single charge. It’s currently billed as being capable of rudimentary tasks like loading cargo, and moving cases around warehouses. Adding product assembly skills to its feature set will be a major leap forward for the bipedal bot.\nOf course, its maker believes it’s destined for greater things. Last March, Apptronik shipped Apollo bots to Mercedes-Benz to help human workers build the automaker’s cars. TechCrunch notes this project is still in the pilot phase . Apptronik also just raised US$350 million in a Series A funding round earlier this month with the aim of scaling up Apollo production, and partnered with Google DeepMind last December to add AI smarts to the bot.\nJabil’s senior VP of global business units Rafael Renno explained that this new project is a big deal for next-generation factories: “Not only will we get a first-hand look at the impact that general-purpose robots can have as we test Apollo in our operations, but as we begin producing Apollo units, we can play a role in defining the future of manufacturing.”\nApptronik hasn’t revealed what Apollo might cost when it goes on sale, but we do have some points of reference: Unitree’s G1 is priced at $16,000 , and Tesla’s Optimus is expected to slot in somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000.\nWhile it’s currently trialing Apollo’s manufacturing capabilities, Apptronik believes that it’s in a position to make humanoid robots ubiquitous, and have it “expand into new markets and roles, such as front-of-house retail, elder care, and eventually home use.”\nRead full story here…",

    "text": "Customers are flocking to Chick-fil-A in Citrus Plaza, which reopened Thursday, Dec. 28, after a 4½-month expansion. Changes include a widened drive-thru with two lanes narrowing to one after customers order, a reconfigured dining room and new restrooms with key pads on their doors to limit entrance. The restaurant [closed in mid-August](https://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/2023/09/19/whats-happening-at-the-chick-fil-a-in-citrus-plaza/) for the project, which included tearing down some exterior walls. Citrus Plaza is in the “ [Donut Hole](https://www.sbsun.com/2014/04/20/construction-starts-in-controversial-donut-hole-near-redlands/),” an unincorporated area outside of Redlands city limits, although the city provides water, sewer, police and fire services in exchange for tax revenue. Contacted in September, representatives for San Bernardino County said the expansion increases storage space for an expected boost in drive-thru business, which was already brisk. Hours are 6:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday and 10:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday, according to the restaurant’s website. All Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed Sunday. The address is 27520 W Lugonia Ave. Information: [chick-fil-a.com](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/locations/ca/citrus-plaza)",

    "text": "The Golden State Warriors are entering the new NBA season as underdogs in the Western Conference. After years of being the pace setters in the NBA, their new position within the league is likely taking some getting used to, and perhaps even firing up some of the veteran players to prove the doubters wrong. Recently, an anonymous NBA coach likened Golden State to an aging rock band that's still on tour. The comment came during an interview with Steve Bulpett of Heavy on Sports. Those comments wouldn't have sat well with the Warriors roster, many of whom are just two years removed from their last championship with the franchise. “I was thinking about this the other day,” [The coach told Bulpett.] During a recent interview with Laura Britt of NBC Sports Bay Area, Brandin Podziemski admitted that the Warriors' don't enjoy hearing that sort of criticism but are using it as fuel ahead of the new season. He also noted how the lower expectations will allow Golden State to play freely next season, which could help them unlock a level that we didn't see last season. “We don’t love to hear that, but we love to hear that in the fact that we’re going to do something that no one expects us to do,” Podziemski said. “They don’t think that we’re the Warriors that we were before, and for us, I think it’s just the best feeling when you don’t have anything to lose out there, and you just go out and prove people wrong. I think there’s a bunch of guys with that mentality that thrive off proving people wrong, and I know Steph [Curry] is one of those guys. So just to be alongside him in the backcourt and in combination with all of our other guys, we’re just excited to prove people wrong.” After adding De'Anthony Melton, Kyle Anderson and Buddy Hield this summer, Golden State will have a deeper, more talented team than the one Steve Kerr had available to him last season. Whether that additional depth will be enough to catapult the Warriors back into championship contention will remain to be seen. One thing is for sure, though: counting out Steph Curry before the season has even begun could prove to be a costly mistake. This post originally appeared on Warriors Wire !
