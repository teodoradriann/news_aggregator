    "title": "Is the Matildas Olympics campaign over before it began? Australia medal chances look bleak after Germany loss | Sporting News Australia",
    "text": "Just over a year ago, the Matildas began their home World Cup campaign with something close to a bang in front of 75,000 boisterous fans in Sydney as Steph Catley’s penalty secured a 1-0 win against the Republic of Ireland. The beginning of their 2024 Olympics campaign was far closer to a whimper, as in a less atmospheric Marseille, the Matildas wilted and melted away in a 3-0 defeat to Germany. It was never going to be an easy start to what is a difficult tournament, but the performance from Australia saw old problems rear their ugly head and new ones emerge. MORE: Matildas next match | Matildas Olympics draw Yes, Germany were a class above in a clinical and complete performance; their attack eventually hummed after taking time to find its rhythm, and their defence was rock solid. In isolation, a defeat to the fourth best team in the world and a side the Matildas haven’t defeated in 20 years is not necessarily a crisis, but the margin and manner of defeat will have sent alarm bells ringing. There was cautious optimism as injury concerns surrounding the team in the lead-up to the tournament came to nothing, as Steph Catley, Katrina Gorry and Caitlin Foord all lined up as coach Tony Gustavsson picked his strongest side possible, with Cortnee Vine leading the line and Mary Fowler being just behind her in a free-roaming role. That optimism faded as the game began and the Matildas attack quickly became bogged down in a manner all too familiar to fans, with Germany comfortably sitting in a lower block, denying the pacy Matildas attack any space in behind, as well as limiting Fowler’s influence on the game. The match continued a concerning trend where the Matildas couldn't find a way to get the supremely talented Fowler into the game, with the attacker limited to just 37 touches in a game where she often drifted far from dangerous positions in an attempt to exert her influence; it was a similar story for Foord and Vine, with the pair getting 31 and 14 touches respectively. Whilst the Matildas have many quality players in attacking positions, the lack of a world-class number nine outside of the injured Sam Kerr is a significant problem which has been highlighted in the superstar’s absences due to injury over the last 12 months, and out and out striker Michelle Heyman was only introduced into the game in the 77th minute when the result was secured for Germany. This issue isn’t new for Australia, what is new is the concerning concession of two goals from corners, as Australia’s usually solid defence looked suspect from open play and set pieces. Germany should have opened the scoring earlier than they did, with player of the match Jule Brand spurning two opportunities early on, though towering centre back Marina Hegering made no mistake as she evaded Ellie Carpenter and out-jumped Alanna Kennedy to score Germany’s first. Despite being outplayed and failing to get a shot on target in the first-half, the Matildas were only behind by a goal and showed a bit more intent after the break, but Germany continued to create the lion’s share of chances as the Matildas defence became more harried and desperate in their attempts to hold out their opponents, it seemed it would only be a matter of time before the dam burst. Two goals in four minutes did the trick for the Germans, as a near carbon copy of the first goal saw an unmarked Lea Schuller easily head home from a corner, before a slick counter-attack cut the Australia defence into ribbons and gave Brand a deserved goal from close range; Germany were only denied a fourth by the offside flag. Some Australian players can hold their heads high - Katrina Gorry put in a standout performance in her return from injury, and Heyman and Sharn Freier looked promising off the bench - but the scoreline and statistics were a fair reflection of the match, with Germany having 17 shots to Australia’s eight, and creating five big chances. Gustavsson admitted Germany deserved their win and lamented his side's defending of set pieces: “I don’t think we were ready for it… they were a class better than us tonight. It’s just fact. We need to be real and honest about that. Obviously a bit upset that they scored on two set pieces, which we had planned for exactly … we trained [for] it, we focused on it.” The result puts a question mark over the Matildas' credentials at the tournament; they face a mountain to climb if they are to finish in the top two, and their goal difference means their chances of finishing as one of the two best third-placed teams has taken a hit. They now face the prospect of needing a result against the USA to qualify, and even if they manage to do so, potential clashes against world champions Spain or host nation France await, and with the way the Matildas are performing, it is difficult to see them being a threat to sides of that calibre. Gustavsson and captain Steph Catley struck a defiant tone post-match, noting the Matildas had been in this position before in the World Cup after their defeat to Nigeria; back then Gustavsson made tactical tweaks leading them to top of the group and go on a magical run to the semi-finals. That could happen again, though this time Australia don’t have the prospect of a returning Kerr and more importantly a sold-out crowd backing them to the hilt. It all begs the question, is the Matildas Olympics campaign over before it began? Mathematically speaking it certainly isn’t, with the Matildas having a more than winnable match against Zambia next, yet the performances and recurring problems make it hard to be confident in the Matildas chances of making another deep run at the tournament.",

    "title": "Accusers of Harvey Weinstein want new trial after overturned rape and assault conviction | National & World News | news8000.com",
    "text": "(CNN) — When Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was found [guilty of two sex crimes in February 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/us/harvey-weinstein-trial-verdict/index.html), the conviction was hailed as a landmark moment in the #MeToo movement. Now, over four years later, the ruling from the New York Court of Appeals [overturning that conviction](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/25/us/harvey-weinstein-conviction-overturned-appeal/index.html) has sent shockwaves through communities of sexual assault survivors, particularly the more than 100 women who have accused Weinstein of assault and harassment. “This today is an act of institutional betrayal,” actor and activist Ashley Judd, who was among the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, said a UN event for workplace safety. “Our institutions betray survivors of male sexual violence.” Accusers who spoke with CNN on Thursday echoed Judd’s frustration with the appeals court’s decision. Some expressed gratitude that Weinstein was [convicted and sentenced to a lengthy prison term](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-los-angeles/index.html) in a Los Angeles courtroom on similar charges. “This is a very sad day for countless women who suffered at the hands of a serial predator,” said Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who accused Weinstein of rape and testified in the Los Angeles trial. “Harvey Weinstein is a serial predator and rapist,” she said. “The bravery of the women who came forward ensures that regardless of what happens in New York, Weinstein will die in prison.” Weinstein, 72, has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. He was [convicted in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/us/harvey-weinstein-sentence/index.html) in New York of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and he was sentenced to [23 years in prison](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/us/harvey-weinstein-sentence/index.html). However, the state court of appeals overturned that conviction Thursday and ordered a new trial, stating that the [use of “prior bad acts” witnesses](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/25/us/harvey-weinstein-conviction-overturned-appeal/index.html) should not have been allowed. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said it plans to retry the case. “We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,” said office spokesperson Emily Tuttle. Weinstein’s attorney Arthur Aidala said his client will be ready for a retrial “on the first day we walk into that courtroom.” In addition, last year, in a case out of Los Angeles, Weinstein was sentenced to [16 years in prison](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-los-angeles/index.html) after being convicted of rape and sexual assault. That case has also been appealed. Here’s a look at how some of his accusers have reacted to the decision. ‘Disheartening’ and ‘profoundly unjust’ The Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein accusers, called the news “disheartening” and “profoundly unjust.” The group said when sexual assault survivors broke their silence in 2017, “the world changed,” adding that Weinstein’s ruling “does not diminish the validity of our experiences or our truth; it’s merely a setback.” Elizabeth Fegan, an attorney who represented several women in the sexual abuse cases brought against Weinstein, including Siebel Newson, said, “Some thought the L.A. case to be superfluous in light of the NY verdict, but now we realize how important it was.” “The California survivors stepped into the line of fire, putting themselves through enormous emotional pain reliving the sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of Weinstein,” Fegan said. “They were adamant that regardless of the New York verdict on appeal the prosecutors in California should pursue charges to ensure Weinstein stayed behind bars.” Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, an activist and model who [was one of the first women to accuse Weinstein](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/entertainment/ambra-gutierrez-model-alliance/index.html) of wrongdoing, said the ruling was another example of the “ongoing failure of the justice system – and the courts – to take survivors seriously and to protect our interests.” She said she and other survivors expect Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to “pursue Weinstein now.” In 2015, Gutierrez filed a sexual abuse complaint with the New York Police Department against Weinstein, stating that he groped her during a meeting. The next day, the NYPD’s Special Victims Division asked her to wear a recording device and talk to him again, and in the recording, Weinstein made potentially incriminating comments to Gutierrez, apologizing for touching her breast. Despite the recording, New York prosecutors cited a lack of evidence in the case and declined to prosecute. Gutierrez later reached an undisclosed settlement with Weinstein. Dawn Dunning, who [testified as a “prior bad acts” witness](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/us/witnesses-harvey-weinstein-trial/index.html) in Weinstein’s New York trial, said she was “stunned that the court threw out Weinstein’s conviction on legal technicalities.” Still, she said she was proud that she testified and “confronted that convicted rapist.” “Preparing for the trial took two years of my life. I had to relive the trauma of the assault every day. But since today’s ruling, people have asked me if I regret having testified,” Dunning said. “And my answer is a resounding, ‘No.’ “I came forward to support other women who were also sexually abused by Weinstein and to ensure that he would be held accountable. I had nothing to gain, and much to lose in terms of loss of privacy and the trauma that comes with confronting one’s abuser in court. I am a stronger person for having done so, and I know that other women found strength and courage because I and other Weinstein survivors confronted him publicly. The culture has changed, and I am confident that there is no going back,” she said. Actress Caitlin Dulany, who accused Weinstein of assaulting her during the Cannes Film Festival in 1996, called for reform in the justice system. “I am deeply saddened and absolutely devastated by today’s ruling,” Dulany told CNN. “There are so many of us who lived silently with our stories for years, for fear of retribution and with the belief that we could not seek and achieve justice. What Harvey Weinstein did to us affected our lives and careers in ways that we will never recover from. What happened today is a travesty of justice – but I’m not surprised. The justice system is in deep need of reform. This is a terrible setback for survivors everywhere who are brave enough to come forward with the stories of abuse.” Sarah Ann Masse, an actress and founder of the organization Hire Survivors Hollywood, told CNN, “Regardless of today’s ruling, the truth of what Harvey Weinstein did was never in question. Long before the trials, long before the silence was broken in the press, long before this was international news, those of us who were abused by him knew that this man was a sexual predator. The subsequent court rulings served as a form of justice, an affirmation that we were believed, and a step towards challenging societal beliefs that are built on a foundation of rape culture and victim blaming.” Masse – who appeared in Universal’s movie “She Said,” which chronicled the journalists who broke the bombshell allegations against Weinstein – added, “Please know that nothing about today’s decision implies or states that Weinstein is innocent.” Jessica Barth, an actress and activist who founded the organization Voices in Action, said the decision was a step backwards. “The decision to overturn Harvey Weinstein’s conviction is a tragic step backwards in the fight for justice and accountability for victims of sexual violence and it sets a dangerous precedent concerning sexual assault cases,” she said. “Evidence of prior bad acts in order to prove a pattern of behavior is often allowed in criminal cases and should absolutely be allowed in sexual assault cases.” Attorneys for accusers criticize ruling Attorneys Debra S. Katz and Lisa Banks, who [represented Dunning](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/us/harvey-weinstein-trial-verdict/index.html), also called on Bragg to retry the case to “ensure that Weinstein receives the punishment that he deserves.” Miriam “Mimi” Haley, whose testimony made up the first-degree criminal sexual act charge, “would consider testifying again” in a potential retrial, her attorney Gloria Allred said in a statement. “Even though the process of testifying was grueling and retraumatizing for Mimi, she reaffirmed to me today that she would consider testifying again if (Manhattan) District Attorney Alvin Bragg decided to proceed with a new trial of Harvey Weinstein,” Allred said. “I commend Mimi on her courage and willingness to keep standing up for the truth.” Years before Weinstein was on trial, Anita Hill became a national figure when she accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, testifying against him during his 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Today, Hill is the chair and president of The Hollywood Commission, which conducted a survey throughout the entertainment industry about sexual harassment and other inappropriate behaviors. Reacting to Weinstein’s conviction being overturned, Hill said, “We have seen a lack of progress in addressing the power imbalances that allow abuse to occur and that sexual assault continues to be a pervasive problem. Many survivors do not pursue justice because they believe nothing will be done. Today’s decision underscores the urgent need for systemic changes in our institutions – and redoubles our commitment to survivors to push for the policies and systems that will ensure accountability and bring about workplaces free from the behavior that drives the need for these systems in the first place.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

According to a December 28 USCCB [statement](https://www.usccb.org/news/2023/catholics-make-positive-impact-showing-solidarity-church-latin-america), the collection goes toward a wide variety of ministries, communities, and emergency disaster relief programs in Latin America. Last year’s “collection delivered more than $6.5 million in grants to help people who reside in regions where poverty, political and religious persecution, and other hardships make it difficult for the Church to support itself.” The collection in many dioceses across the United States will take place from January 27-8. [#iGiveCatholicTogether](https://usccb.igivecatholictogether.org/organizations/usccb-church-in-latin-america) also accepts funds and donations for the collection. Chairman of the USCCB Subcommittee on the Church in Latin America and Emeritus Auxiliary Bishop of Brooklyn Octavio Cisneros said of the collection, In an era with too much focus on what divides us from our sisters and brothers in Latin America, Catholics across the United States continue to strengthen our bonds of faith, hope, and love through their gifts to the U.S. bishops’ annual Collection for the Church in Latin America. According to the statement, last year’s collection funded 251 total [grants](https://www.usccb.org/committees/church-latin-america/cla-grant-information-informacion-del-programa-de-ayuda) that supported evangelization and catechesis, pro-life work and family ministry, “outreach to groups as diverse as prisoners, university students, and Indigenous communities,” the “sponsoring the formation of seminarians, clergy and those in consecrated life,” and “emergency disaster relief after hurricanes, earthquakes and floods.” In the Diocese of Itztapalpa, Mexico, the collection “supported an evangelization center where newly released convicts receive practical help with job-hunting, along with spiritual and emotional support and opportunities for recreation,” the USCCB statement read. “In Brazil, where persons of African ancestry suffer racial discrimination, the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil obtained a grant to engage Afro-Brazilian Catholic leaders in helping the Church more effectively promote and live Pope Francis’ vision for loving our neighbors,” the statement added. In Peru, another grant went to the Prelature of Chuquibambilla in the Andes, and “supported alliances between Church leaders, healthcare organizations and law enforcement to teach church workers how to prevent, report and respond to suspected abuse of children and vulnerable adults.” The Sisters of the Eucharistic Communicators of the Heavenly Father in Columbia are able to teach the Bible, Catholic doctrine, spirituality, and family life-skills, such as budgeting, to families in spiritual and material need through funding from the collection. The [website](https://www.usccb.org/committees/church-latin-america) for the USCCB Subcommittee on the Church in Latin America states, Your contribution makes a positive impact by supporting seminary studies for future priests, pastoral ministries that provide reconciliation, spiritual direction, and job search assistance to prisoners completing jail sentences, and other vital ministries that bring the light of Christ into the lives of thousands in Central and South America and the Caribbean islands.",

    "text": "Atlético de Madrid\nCopa del Rey\nLa polémica última acción del Atlético - Sevilla que anuló el VAR y el otro penalti que pide el equipo andaluz\nGil Manzano señaló una pena máxima de Pablo Barrios a Lamela en el último minuto, pero rectificó tras verlo en el monitor. De lo que se queja el Sevilla es de otra acción entre Nahuel Molina y Sow\nEl triunfo del\nAtlético de Madrid ante el Sevilla (1-0) que le valió la clasificación para las semifinales de la Copa del Rey fue con susto al final. Estaba el encuentro a punto de finalizar, y sucedió esto.\nLo estaba haciendo de maravilla el equipo del Cholo, manteniendo a su rival lejos de la portería de Oblak, pero en el último instante logró por fin romper líneas, Lamela entró en el área rojiblanca y Pablo Barrios arriesgó lanzándose al suelo para rebañar el balón. El atacante hispalense acabó en el suelo y el árbitro, Gil Manzano, no lo dudó: penalti.\nSergio Ramos pidió la pelota. Se relamía el central. Iba a asumir la responsabilidad del lanzamiento que podía mandar el encuentro a la prórroga, pero desde la sala del VAR dijeron al colegiado extremeño que fuera a revisar la acción. No dudó mucho después de verlo en el monitor: entiende que el centrocampista madrileño toca la pelota. Hay que esperar a los audios que se harán públicos para saber la conversación exacta. El caso es que entendió que no era penalti.\nMarcao, al final del encuentro en los micrófonos de Movistar, más que de esa acción, se quejó de otra entre Nahuel Molina y Sow. “Prefieron no hablar”, dijo el brasileño, visiblemente enfadado. “En la de Lamela toca balón, pero la de Sow podía haber pitado penalti”, afirmó Jesús Navas, en un tono tranquilo.\nEn un encuentro muy cerrado, con pocas ocasiones, hubo más acciones en las áreas. Como esta a favor del Atlético.\nNahuel entra en el área y Marcao mete la pierna. El lateral buscó el contacto, pero Gil Manzano entendió que había penalti. Es una acción interpretable, por eso el VAR no intervino. Después, Griezmann tuvo la mala suerte se resbalarse antes del lanzamiento, y tirarla por encima del larguero.",

    "text": "The rivalry between Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and OpenAI’s Sam Altman appears to be intensifying, moving beyond artificial intelligence into the realm of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology.\nWhile their AI competition has played out publicly on X (formerly Twitter), Altman is reportedly preparing to take on Musk’s Neuralink through a new venture, Merge Labs — a brain-to-computer interface startup currently in its formative stages.\nNeuralink, Musk’s BCI company, has already achieved milestones by implanting computer chips in human brains and progressing to clinical trials. These trials are aimed at enabling people with severe paralysis to control devices with their thoughts.\nAccording to sources cited by TechCrunch, Altman is a co-founder of Merge Labs and is actively engaged in fundraising. The company’s primary backing is expected to come from OpenAI’s ventures division, although discussions remain in the early stages and no firm commitment has been made, making the initiative’s future uncertain.\nMerge Labs is also believed to be working with Alex Blania, a key figure in Altman’s digital ID project, Tools for Humanity.\nThe BCI sector, largely dominated by Neuralink since its founding in 2016, has been a focal point for futurists and technologists exploring the so-called “singularity” — the merging of human consciousness with technology. Both Musk and Altman have expressed long-standing interest in this vision. In 2017, Altman authored a blog post titled “The Merge,” in which he suggested that humans might become “the first species ever to design our own descendants.”\nIf Merge Labs proceeds, it could set the stage for a fresh chapter in the high-stakes technology rivalry between two of Silicon Valley’s most prominent and competitive figures.\nADVERTISEMENT",
