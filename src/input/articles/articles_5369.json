    "title": "Multiyear ice obstructing the Northwest Passage, causing significant reduction in navigability",
    "text": "A recent study showed a significant decline in the navigability of the Northwest Passage, Arctic Archipelago due to obstructions caused by multilayer ice in the region.\nA new study published in Communications Earth & Environment revealed that the Northwest Passage, which connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans through Arctic waters, has experienced a significant reduction in navigability in recent years. This reduction is mainly attributed to the southward drift of multiyear ice, obstructing key shipping routes.\nSince the first recorded transit of the Northwest Passage in 1906, fewer than 400 voyages have successfully navigated these waters. Despite the challenges posed by unpredictable ice and weather conditions, the passage has remained an attractive option because of the significant distance it can save on shipping journeys between the two oceans.\nHowever, according to an analysis of satellite data from 2007 to 2021, the shipping season in the Northwest Passage has been shrinking. This occurs despite a general decline in sea ice thickness and extent across the Arctic, which is often believed to make the passage more viable during the summer months.\nThe map shows all ship tracks 1990–2018 (grey lines), and shipping routes (four different line colours) along the Northwest Passage (NWP). Ship tracks from Pizzolato et al.; updated. Land relief from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean V3 (IBCAO). Credit: Nature/Authors On July 13, 2024, NASA’s PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem) satellite captured a mostly cloud-free image of the Northwest Passage. The image showed that ice was obstructing all shipping routes around Victoria Island.\nAccording to Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), despite the Arctic sea ice extent ranking seventh-lowest in the satellite record for mid-July, the ice coverage around the Canadian archipelago remains near record-low levels for this time of year. While the southern route around Victoria Island is expected to clear by late September, conditions in the channels could change depending on wind patterns and drifting ice, Meier added.\nThe study identified the movement of multiyear ice from higher-latitude regions as a key factor in maintaining “choke points” along certain sections of the passage. This older, thicker ice is more resilient to atmospheric and oceanic changes, making it a persistent barrier in the channels.\nDespite the overall decline in Arctic sea ice thickness and extent, the presence of this multiyear ice in the northern Canadian islands and Greenland continues to obstruct shipping routes.\nAn analysis of 40 years of satellite data shows a long-term decline in Arctic sea ice, with older, more durable ice becoming increasingly rare.\nAccording to NOAA’s 2023 Arctic Report, ice older than four years covered nearly 2.5 million km 2 (965 255 mi 2 ) in September 1985. By September 2023, that coverage had dwindled to less than 100 000 km 2 (38 610 mi 2 ).\nThe Northwest Passage remained largely ice-covered in the past, blocking the inflow of Arctic Ocean ice. However, as the channels have melted in recent years, thick, hazardous ice has increasingly infiltrated the passage, posing new challenges for navigation, according to Meier.\nReferences:\n1 Sea ice choke points reduce the length of the shipping season in the Northwest Passage – Cook, A.J., Dawson, J., Howell, S.E.L., et al. – Commun Earth Environ 5 , 362 (2024) – https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01477-6 – OPEN ACCESS\n2 Sea Ice Chokes the Northwest Passage – NASA/EO – Accessed on August 8, 2024\nFeatured image credit: NASA/EO",

    "text": "AMMAN — Following Royal directives, the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army (JAF) on Thursday carried out five joint airdrops of aid to the north of the war-ravaged Gaza Strip. JAF said that the airdrops were carried out in response to the humanitarian duty and as part of the ongoing efforts of Jordan to support the steadfastness of the Palestinians and alleviate their suffering under the Israeli war on their besieged strip. The operation involved the participation of two C130 aircraft from the Royal Jordanian Air Force, one military cargo plane from the US, one from Egypt, and one from Belgium. This endeavour is part of Jordan's continuous efforts to provide families in the Gaza Strip with food, medical aid and humanitarian supplies, in a bid to make up for the acute scarcity of food and medication brought on by Israel's ongoing aggression on the coastal enclave, according to JAF statement.

    "text": "The shocking case of Nathaniel Veltman, a self-professed Canadian white nationalist, has once again brought to light the devastating consequences of extremist ideologies. Veltman’s deliberate act of violence, which claimed the lives of four members of a Muslim family in 2021, has not only left a community in mourning but has also forced Canadians to confront the reality of white nationalist terrorism within their borders. Tragic Incident In June 2021, Veltman callously plowed his pick-up truck into five members of the Afzaal family while they were out for an evening walk in the Ontario town of London. The vicious attack resulted in the deaths of Salman Afzaal, his wife Madiha Salman, their 15-year-old daughter Yumnah, and Salman’s 74-year-old mother Talat. The lone survivor, their nine-year-old son, was left with serious injuries. Read More: [Canada man accused of running over Muslim family pleads not guilty](https://www.globalvillagespace.com/canada-man-accused-of-running-over-muslim-family-pleads-not-guilty/) Verdict and Legal Proceedings After being found guilty of first-degree murder, Veltman was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. The judge unequivocally labeled the attack as an act of terrorism, marking a significant acknowledgment of the threat posed by white nationalist violence. Despite Veltman’s defense attempting to downplay his actions by citing mental challenges, the court held him accountable for his heinous crimes. Impact on the Muslim Community The tragedy sent shockwaves through the Muslim community in Canada, rekindling memories of past atrocities such as the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting. Crown attorney Sarah Shaikh emphasized the significance of denouncing hatred and ideologically driven violence, stressing that such actions have no place in a democratic society. The Afzaal family’s relatives expressed mixed emotions, acknowledging the verdict while recognizing that it could never undo the irreparable loss they’ve suffered. Read More: [Upcoming trial of the man who murdered th Afzaal family in Canada](https://www.globalvillagespace.com/upcoming-trial-of-the-man-who-murdered-th-afzaal-family-in-canada/) Veltman’s case highlights the urgent need to address the root causes of extremism and bolster efforts to counter radicalization. It serves as a stark reminder of the deep-seated divisions within society and the dangers posed by individuals who espouse hateful ideologies. While the verdict provides a measure of accountability, it also prompts reflection on how to prevent similar tragedies in the future through education, community engagement, and proactive measures to combat extremism.",

    "text": "agenzia\nMaltempo: Nicita (Pd), ‘Lollobrigida si dimetta, offende Sicilia’\nRoma, 10 mag. “Le parole contro la Sicilia pronunciate pubblicamente da Lollobrigida in Parlamento sono uno scandalo. Non solo il ministro dell’Agricoltura dimostra di non avere alcuna consapevolezza di cosa significhi essere un’isola e di quali sono le difficoltà quotidiane di chi abita la Regione. Ma rivela il totale disinteresse del governo Meloni per la nostra Sicilia, dove vivono circa 5 milioni di cittadine e cittadini. A loro dovrebbe rivolgere al più presto le proprie scuse. Ma, questa volta, non basteranno. Deve dimettersi”. Così Antonio Nicita, senatore Pd e candidato alle europee nella circoscrizione Isole.\n“Sottolineando che ‘per fortuna’ la siccità quest’anno colpirà più il Sud – e in particolare la Sicilia – rispetto al Nord, il ministro non ha commesso alcuna gaffe, ma espresso una vera e propria dichiarazione di intenti della maggioranza: spaccare a metà il Paese, penalizzare il Sud-Italia, fare la guerra ai più fragili. Niente di più di quanto già previsto nello squallido progetto di autonomia differenziata realizzato da Calderoli su mandato di Salvini. È vergognoso”.COPYRIGHT LASICILIA.IT © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "title": "Shot down: Kristi Noem doesn’t make the cut for Trump’s VP shortlist",
    "text": "South Dakota governor and confessed dog killer Kristi Noem has been struck from Donald Trump’s latest list of potential running mates, according to a report. The Trump campaign has requested personal information for eight possible vice presidential picks, Politico reported. Noem, long suspected to be a top veep candidate, was not named. Despite numerous predictions that Trump would pick a woman as his running mate in the 2024 White House race, the list only includes one: New York Rep Elise Stefanik. The seven others are Ohio Senator JD Vance; North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum; South Carolina Senator Tim Scott; Florida Rep Byron Donalds; Florida Senator Marco Rubio; Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton; and former Trump Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. The Independent has emailed Governor Noem’s office for comment. Her absence from Trump’s VP shortlist comes weeks after a dog-related incident in her new book grabbed headlines for all the wrong reasons. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem speaks before Donald Trump during a Buckeye Values PAC Rally in Vandalia, Ohio, on March 16, 2024 (AFP via Getty Images) The Republican released a tell-all memoir, which included an anecdote about shooting her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer Cricket, which she described as “untrainable” and “less than worthless… as a hunting dog”. The backlash to the story grew so intense that Amazon restricted the review section for her book, titled No Going Back, so that only “verified” purchasers could write posts. Noem doubled down following the widespread criticism. “We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years,” she posted on X. In another post, she continued: “I can understand why some people are upset about a 20 year old story of Cricket, one of the working dogs at our ranch, in my upcoming book.” It’s unclear how much the firestorm factored into Trump’s VP list consideration. Some reports said that her chances of joining the Trump ticket were dead in the water long before the dog-killing story surfaced. Six sources told Politico in March that she had been “cast aside” as Mr Trump’s potential running mate. In mid-May, Trump said in a podcast interview that Noem was “terrific” and admitted she had weathered “a couple of rough stories, there’s no question about it.” He later added: “She had a bad week. We all have bad weeks.” From news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "text": "MADRID 29 Nov. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nSouth Europe Ground Services, la filial de handling del grupo IAG, ha firmado este jueves el acta final de la negociación para su expediente de regulación de empleo (ERE) y tendrá abierto el plazo de adhesión voluntaria entre el 11 y el 27 de diciembre, con la intención de resolverlo para unas 1.500 personas.\nLa compañía ha dado por finalizado ya el proceso de consultas con los representantes de los trabajadores de todos sus centros de trabajo tras alcanzar un acuerdo mayoritario.\nDentro del acuerdo, los trabajadores indefinidos o en excedencia con reserva de puesto de trabajado que cumplan 60 o más años desde el inicio del ERE, que finalizará el 31 de diciembre de 2026, podrán acogerse a la prejubilación con un porcentaje garantizado acordado del 50% del salario regulador, es decir, la percepción bruta anual correspondiente a los doce meses previos.\nEstos trabajadores mantendrán el derecho a utilizar billetes 'free', lo que supone que pueden volar de manera gratuita en las aerolíneas del grupo, según el acuerdo alcanzado el pasado 2 de febrero.\nAsimismo, podrá acogerse al ERE cualquier trabajador indefinido aunque no cumpla los requisitos para solicitar la modalidad de prejubilación.\nPara quienes opten por acogerse de manera voluntaria, las condiciones pactadas son la indemnización por importe de 21 días por año de servicio, con un máximo de doce mensualidades.\nEl consejero delegado de South, Miguel Ángel Gimeno, ha señalado que el acuerdo es una noticia \"muy positiva\", ya que \"garantiza el futuro sostenible\" de la compañía.\nSouth es la filial de handling del Grupo IAG que opera en 38 aeropuertos nacionales. Presta servicio de handling para las compañías del grupo IAG y a otras terceras compañías.\nLa compañía fue inscrita en el Registro Mercantil el pasado 19 de febrero después de que Iberia Airport Services perdiera la licencia de operador de 'handling' en ocho grandes aeropuertos (Barcelona-El Prat, Palma de Mallorca, Málaga, Alicante, Gran Canaria, Tenerife Sur, Ibiza y Bilbao) en el último concurso de Aena, resuelto en septiembre de 2023.\nComo consecuencia, se inició un conflicto social porque los sindicatos temían una pérdida en la calidad de sus condiciones laborales que acabó a principios del pasado febrero, tras varias convocatorias de huelga, con un acuerdo para la constitución de esta nueva empresa y el proyecto de un ERE voluntario.\nLeer más acerca de: ERE IAG",
