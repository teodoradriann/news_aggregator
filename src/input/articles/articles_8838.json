    "text": "Ex-Ohio State QB has major criticism of Miami program\nThe Miami Hurricanes finished off another underwhelming season Thursday with a Pinstripe Bowl loss to Rutgers, prompting one former national champion quarterback to deliver a damning verdict about their program.\nCardale Jones, who guided the Ohio State Buckeyes to a title in 2014, said on X Thursday he felt “bad” for any recruits that had committed to Miami for NIL money. To Jones, the Hurricanes have an unstable program with a terrible home atmosphere, and that “chasing the money isn’t always the answer.”\nMan, I feel bad for the recruits going to Miami U for NIL…….. bad staff, no stability within program and one of the worst college home game atmospheres.\nChasing the money isn’t always the answer. But good luck\n— Cardale Jones (@CJ1two)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe Hurricanes are a long way removed from the glory days of the early 2000s. Though they have a robust NIL program that\nhas helped recruit some top talent, the program still appears to be treading water. Despite the splashy hire of Mario Cristobal as coach prior to the 2022 season, the Hurricanes finished just 7-6 this season, dropping Cristobal to 12-13 since his return to the school. He has also faced criticism for some of his game management.\nMiami will certainly be a factor in recruiting battles, and they are bringing in another highly-rated class for 2024. If things don’t turn around on the field, however, Jones’ commentary will probably be echoed by many others.",

    "text": "They told us there would be some bomb waves on the west coast this week due to offshore storms, but I didn't realize they were talking this big.\nYes sir, that's like a mini tsunami right there, so those must be some powerful storms out on the Pacific.\nAnother angle:\nMan, that is both scary and awesome at the same time. Citizens of California's beach towns have mostly ignored calls to evacuate, and believe it or not, despite warnings from the National Weather Service, there are surfers out there catching some of these waves. The rip current is incredibly powerful right now, and anyone risking their lives out there for a gnarly wave is either insane or has a death wish (or both).\nAt least 8 people were hospitalized when gigantic waves wreaked havoc across coastal California towns on Thursday, as powerful storms hovered over the Pacific Ocean.\nDaring residents ignored evacuation orders and flocked to the beaches to watch the epic show of the waves crashing, but some were too close as the monstrous waves broke over the seawalls.\nA rogue wave swept approximately 20 beachgoers at Pierpont Beach around 11 a.m. in Ventura.\nA few more shots of the California coast:\nDebris including driftwood and logs were reported to have washed up on shore in the [Ventura] area.\n\"They're washing logs up here. A lot of debris, a lot of driftwood. So we've been asking people to avoid the direct coastal area,\" Keehn added.\nThe Ventura Fire Department said it was working overnight to create artificial beach berms to protect the nearby residential neighborhoods …\nThe entire west coast from Washington down to the US-Mexico border is also under High wave warnings and advisories until 3 a.m. local time Friday with coastal flooding warnings in effect until the afternoon.\nPretty scary stuff out there in California, but it looks like it'll be over shortly.\n ",

    "text": "The fading Chicago Cubs open a three-game series against the host Kansas City Royals, hoping their first road trip after the All-Star break goes better than the six home games that preceded it.\nNeeding wins badly to climb into wild-card contention to start the second half, the Cubs saw their offense fall flat. They scored no more than three runs in any of the six games and lost two of three games each to the Arizona Diamondbacks and division rival Milwaukee Brewers.\n\"We pitched well,\" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said. \"We didn't score enough runs.\"\nChicago stranded 22 baserunners while batting 3-for-19 with runners in scoring position against Milwaukee.\n\"We just didn't do enough offensively,\" Counsell said after Wednesday's 3-2 loss. \"It was very quiet. There wasn't any traffic. There wasn't any at-bats to put pressure on them. It was a light offensive day.\"\nFollowing a season-best five-game winning streak when the Cubs scored at least four runs per game, the Cubs were within three games of .500 and 2 1/2 games of the third wild-card spot. But they have dropped six of nine games since then and lost all three series while scoring 24 total runs. Eight of those runs came in one of the victories.\nThe struggling offense could soon get a boost with the return of Cody Bellinger.\nOn the injured list with a non-displaced fracture of his left middle finger after being hit by a pitch July 10, Bellinger took part in a pregame workout Wednesday.\n\"He had a really good workout,\" Counsell said after Bellinger's on-field batting practice session Tuesday.\nBellinger is not expected to require a rehab assignment, and Counsell indicated he may initially use Bellinger in the designated hitter role upon his return.\nRight-handers Kyle Hendricks (2-8, 6.69 ERA) and Brady Singer (6-6, 3.00) take the mound in Friday's opener.\nHendricks is 2-0 with a 1.40 ERA in three career starts covering 19 1/3 innings against the Royals. Most recently, he gave Kansas City just one unearned run over six innings on Aug. 20, 2023, in a 4-3 win.\nAdam Frazier has two homers and two doubles while hitting .419 (13-for-31) with three RBIs and three walks against Hendricks.\nIn six starts since returning to the rotation June 19, Hendricks is 2-4 with a 4.45 ERA.\nIn two starts against the Cubs, Singer is 0-2 with an 8.31 ERA. Last Aug. 19, he took the loss after allowing six runs -- four earned -- on nine hits and two walks in 3 2/3 innings. He gave up two home runs.\nSinger has allowed more than one run just once in his last six starts, and most recently, he tossed seven shutout innings against the White Sox on Saturday.\nJac Caglianone, the Royals' 2024 first-round draft pick (sixth overall), met with media in Kansas City on Wednesday afternoon shortly after signing with the club. He agreed to a $7.5 million signing bonus.\nCaglianone was the 2024 John Olerud Award winner as the best collegiate two-way player. Caglianone hit .419 in 66 games with 35 homers -- second-most among Division I hitters -- and the left-hander was also 5-2 with a 4.76 ERA in 16 starts, helping the Florida Gators reach the College World Series semifinals.\nRoyals general manager J.J. Picollo addressed questions about whether Caglianone would focus on hitting or pitching.\n\"He had a full season pitching this year,\" Picollo said. \"The priority right now is to just let him go out and hit. That's the commonsense thing to do.\"\nPitching may still be in Caglianone's future, however.\n\"I can see that happening,\" Royals area scout Nick Presto said. \"He can do whatever he wants.\"\n--Field Level Media\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0",

    "title": "US judge upholds Trump's $83.3M defamation loss, rejects new trial | KSL.com",
    "text": "Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes NEW YORK — A federal judge on Thursday rejected Donald Trump's bid to throw out an $83.3 million defamation verdict in favor of the writer E. Jean Carroll, who said the former U.S. president defamed her after she accused him of raping her decades ago. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan [denied Trump's requests](https://www.ksl.com/article/50944411/trump-appeals-e-jean-carrolls-833m-defamation-verdict) for a new trial, or to have the former Elle magazine advice columnist's case thrown out altogether. He also dismissed arguments that the jury's award to Carroll following Trump's \"malicious and unceasing attacks\" was too high, and that errors at the civil trial tainted the verdict. Trump is appealing the verdict, and plans to appeal Thursday's decision. \"We categorically disagree with Judge Kaplan's decision,\" his lawyer Alina Habba said in a statement. \"It ignores long-standing constitutional principles and is a prime example of the lawfare raging across this country.\" Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, said she was not surprised by the decision, and said the $83.3 million award was \"entirely reasonable.\" She is not related to the judge. Trump is the Republican presidential candidate in the 2024 election, and also a defendant in four criminal cases, including an [ongoing hush money trial](https://www.ksl.com/article/50991570). In the Jan. 26 verdict, jurors agreed with Carroll that Trump defamed her in June 2019 by denying that he had raped her in the mid-1990s in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan. Jurors awarded Carroll $18.3 million of compensatory damages for emotional and reputational harm, plus $65 million of punitive damages. Trump's lawyers argued that the judge instructed jurors improperly about the burden of proof needed to show malice, and erred in striking testimony about his state of mind. According to the lawyers, Trump's testimony that \"I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency\" was relevant to whether he had acted maliciously, and that excluding it \"all but assured\" a big punitive damages award. But the judge said Trump's attacks had been seen by more than 100 million people and that Trump defamed Carroll with out-of-court statements even during the trial. He also said Trump \"put his hatred and disdain on full display\" in the courtroom, including by muttering that the proceedings were a \"witch hunt\" and \"con job,\" and walking out as Carroll's lawyer made her closing argument. \"On this exceptional record, the punitive damages evidence passes constitutional muster,\" Judge Kaplan wrote. Last May, a [different jury](https://www.ksl.com/article/50640275/jury-finds-trump-liable-for-sexual-abuse-awards-accuser-5m) ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million over an October 2022 denial of Carroll's accusations, finding he had defamed and sexually abused her. Trump is also appealing that verdict.

Las instalaciones de la Fenapo se aprovecharían de tal manera que el área de los “ gritones ” (que se ha inundado en años anteriores) pueda convertirse en un contenedor “natural” del agua que simulará la playa.\n“Para la arena vamos a exportar alrededor de 300 toneladas de arena de Cancún, para que esta sea blanca. Y en cuanto al agua, para que sea más realista, se le echarán cientos de kilos de sal de mar diariamente, para que la gente sienta que verdaderamente se encuentra en la playita”, afirmó el gobernador.\nVisita las cascadas de la Huasteca Potosina y súbete a la tirolesa en bicicleta\n¡Inocente palomita! Hoy, 28 de diciembre , se celebra el día de los Santos Inocentes , fecha en la que en diversos países como en México, se suelen realizar bromas a familiares o amigos, sin una intención verdaderamente maliciosa.\nEsta tradición proviene de las fiestas saturnianas de los romanos, en las que la gente se divertía realizando diversos tipos de bromas. Sin embargo, la fecha se empalmó con la conmemoración cristiana de recordar la masacre del rey Herodes en contra de miles de niños menores de 2 años, con la intención de asesinar a Jesús.\nEn fin, en esta fecha, te recomendamos estar muy al pendiente y alerta, porque quien menos te lo esperes, podría estar haciéndote una broma. ¡Feliz día de los Santos Inocentes!",

    "text": "Do Jellyfish Hurt Dogs? A Comprehensive Guide for Pet Owners Yes, jellyfish can hurt dogs . While a jellyfish sting is rarely fatal for our canine companions, it can cause significant pain and discomfort, leading to a range of unpleasant symptoms. Understanding the risks, recognizing the signs, and knowing how to respond is crucial for any dog owner who enjoys beach trips with their furry friend. This article will delve into everything you need to know about jellyfish stings and dogs, including what to do if your dog gets stung and how to prevent it from happening in the first place.\nThe Risks of Jellyfish Stings to Dogs Jellyfish are fascinating creatures, but their stinging cells, called nematocysts , are designed to inject venom into prey or potential threats. Even dead jellyfish, washed up on the shore, can still pose a danger, as the nematocysts can remain active for weeks.\nWhen a dog comes into contact with a jellyfish, whether through sniffing, licking, biting, or simply stepping on it, the nematocysts can discharge, releasing venom into the dog’s skin. The severity of the reaction depends on several factors:\nType of Jellyfish: Different species have different venom compositions and potency. Some, like the box jellyfish , are extremely dangerous, while others cause milder reactions. Size of the Dog: Smaller dogs are generally more vulnerable to the effects of the venom. Location of the Sting: Stings on the face, particularly near the mouth or nose, can cause more significant swelling and breathing difficulties. Sensitivity of the Dog: Some dogs may be more allergic or sensitive to jellyfish venom than others. Recognizing the Signs of a Jellyfish Sting It’s essential to be able to quickly recognize the signs of a jellyfish sting in your dog. Symptoms can appear within minutes to a few hours after the incident. Common signs include:\nPain: Your dog may yelp, whine, or show signs of discomfort. Licking or Biting the Affected Area: Dogs will instinctively try to alleviate the pain by licking or biting at the sting site, which can worsen the situation. Swelling: Redness and swelling are common around the area of the sting. This can be particularly concerning if the sting is on the face or neck. Drooling: Excessive drooling can indicate nausea or discomfort. Restlessness or Agitation: Your dog may seem anxious or unable to settle down. Muscle Tremors or Cramps: In more severe cases, muscle tremors or cramps may occur. Difficulty Breathing: This is a serious symptom and requires immediate veterinary attention.

First Aid for a Jellyfish Sting If you suspect your dog has been stung by a jellyfish, take the following steps:\nStay Calm: Your dog will sense your anxiety, so try to remain calm and reassuring. Remove Stingers: If you can see any tentacles or stingers on your dog’s skin, carefully remove them using a gloved hand or a pair of tweezers. Avoid rubbing the area, as this can cause more nematocysts to discharge. Rinse with Seawater: Rinse the affected area with seawater. Do not use fresh water , as it can trigger the release of more venom. Apply Vinegar: Vinegar is a common remedy for jellyfish stings. Soaking the area in vinegar for at least 15-30 minutes can help neutralize the venom of certain jellyfish species. Monitor Closely: Keep a close eye on your dog for any signs of a severe reaction, such as difficulty breathing or significant swelling. Seek Veterinary Care: If your dog’s symptoms are severe or do not improve after providing first aid, seek immediate veterinary care. Anaphylactic reactions, although rare, can be life-threatening. Prevention is Key The best way to protect your dog from jellyfish stings is to prevent exposure in the first place. Here are some tips:\nBe Aware of Jellyfish Warnings: Pay attention to local beach warnings and advisories regarding jellyfish sightings. Keep Your Dog on a Leash: This allows you to control your dog’s movements and prevent them from wandering into areas where jellyfish may be present. Avoid Areas with Washed-Up Jellyfish: Keep your dog away from piles of seaweed or dead jellyfish on the beach. Supervise Closely: Always supervise your dog when they are near the water, especially during jellyfish season. FAQs: Jellyfish and Dogs 1. Can a jellyfish sting kill my dog?
