    "title": "Trump portrays 2024 race as a Christian battle, akin to D-Day | U.S. & World | gazette.com",
    "text": "By Nathan Layne and Tim Reid (Reuters) - Donald Trump urged Christians on Thursday to support him in the 2024 presidential election, a contest he depicted in religious terms and likened to the great battles of World War Two. Speaking at a forum for Christian broadcasters in Nashville, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination compared the stakes for the election to D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge and said God's involvement was needed to rescue the country. \"Today we are in another struggle for survival of our nation,\" Trump told the event organized by the National Religious Broadcasters association. \"This time the greatest threat is not from the outside of our country, I really believe this: it's from within.\" \"I am here today because I know that to achieve victory in this fight, just like in the battles of the past, we still need the hand of our Lord, and the grace of Almighty God.\" Since launching his campaign in late 2022, Trump has regularly painted the state of the country in apocalyptic terms, seeking to undermine President Joe Biden's support ahead of a likely rematch for the White House. APPEALING TO CHRISTIAN BASE Trump has at times sought to portray the choice facing Americans in November as one of good versus evil, couching his rhetoric in language that appeals to the conservative Christian voters who form a core of his support base. Conservative Christian voters credit Trump for a series of policy victories including the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion. The thrice-married Trump has retained that support even as faces a criminal trial next month in New York that stems from alleged hush money paid to a porn star. It is one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump, who has derided them all as politically motivated. \"I'm a very proud Christian, actually,\" Trump said. \"I've been very busy fighting and, you know, taking the bullets, taking the arrows. I'm taking them for you and I'm so honored to take them, you have no idea.\" Calling the prosecutors \"bad people,\" Trump attempted to create common cause with his audience by raising fears that the Biden administration was planning to go after Christians and their organizations - despite a lack of evidence to support such an assertion. \"Christians, they can't afford to sit on the sidelines in this fight,\" Trump said. \"The radical left is coming after all of us because they know that our allegiance is not to them. Our allegiance is to our country and our allegiance is to our creator.\" The former president's appearance in the Tennessee capital is no coincidence. The state is one of many holding primaries and caucuses on \"Super Tuesday\" on March 5, the biggest day of nominating contests. Trump is far ahead of Nikki Haley, his sole challenger in the Republican race. He is favored by 30 percentage points in South Carolina's first-in-the-South primary on Saturday, according to the polling average maintained by website FiveThirtyEight. In his speech, Trump referred to people imprisoned for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as \"hostages,\" repeating language he has used several times as a way to embrace his supporters involved in the riot.

    "text": "Vitiligine Week: oltre mille visite gratuite con dermatologi in tutta Italia\nDal 25 al 30 novembre, un’intera settimana di consulenze gratuite per chi soffre di vitiligine prenotando un appuntamento al Numero Verde gratuito 800226466\nI dati parlano chiaro: in Italia sono circa 330.000 le persone che convivono con la vitiligine. Una cifra che cresce, ed è stimata intorno ai 65-95 milioni, se si guarda al mondo intero.\nMa cos’è esattamente la vitiligine?\nLo spiega molto bene Giuseppe Argenziano, Presidente della Società Italiana di Dermatologia e malattie Sessualmente Trasmissibili (SIDeMaST):\n“La vitiligine è stata a lungo considerata una condizione estetica, mentre si tratta di una vera e propria malattia cronica autoimmune, spesso associata ad altri disturbi, quali disfunzioni della tiroide, diabete mellito e alopecia areata.”\nLa vitiligine è una patologia della pelle cronica autoimmune che si manifesta con la presenza di chiazze bianche che possono aumentare in numero e dimensioni nel tempo.\nVitiligine: una “gabbia” che imprigiona corpo e mente\nQuesta patologia ha un forte impatto psicologico e sociale su chi ne soffre, causando spesso ansia e depressione.\nNon sorprende che ansia e depressione siano effettivamente più comuni nelle persone affette da vitiligine, con tassi superiori rispettivamente del 72% e del 32% rispetto al resto della popolazione.\nUna conferma di ciò, arriva dalle parole di Valeria Corazza, Presidente dell’Associazione Pazienti APIAFCO (Associazione Psoriasici Italiani Amici della Fondazione Corazza):\n“La vitiligine costringe chi ne soffre a misurarsi costantemente con la capacità di accettarsi. Spesso induce insicurezza, chiusura, ansia e depressione. In una recente indagine svolta da Elma Research, i pazienti hanno paragonato questa malattia a una gabbia, una pesante zavorra, un enigma incomprensibile.”\nUna settimana di appuntamenti gratuiti durante la Vitiligine Week\nIn una cornice di questo tipo, si attivano, però, anche iniziative che, nel concreto, supportano e offrono un aiuto a chi convive con la patologia.\nDal 25 al 30 novembre, infatti, proprio SIDeMaST promuove la Vitiligine Week, una serie di visite dermatologiche gratuite dedicate ai pazienti con vitiligine.\nIn circa 40 centri dermatologici presenti su tutto il territorio nazionale, in quei giorni, ci si potrà confrontare con medici specialisti per comprendere meglio la malattia e discutere la propria condizione, potendosi aggiornare sulle possibilità terapeutiche.\nPer prenotare un appuntamento è necessario chiamare il Numero Verde gratuito [ 800226466](tel:800226466), attivo dal lunedì al sabato dalle 9 alle 13 e dalle 14 alle 18.\nProprio la presenza di specialisti è fondamentale per chi soffre di vitiligine, tanto che è ancora Valeria Corazza a sottolineare l’importanza di confrontarsi con queste figure professionali:\n“Il confronto con uno specialista è fondamentale per supportare i pazienti in una gestione consapevole della propria condizione e, soprattutto, per combattere la disinformazione.”\nIncyte è al fianco della comunità scientifica e dei pazienti\nLa Vitiligine Week è una campagna realizzata da SIDeMaST e patrocinata da APIAFCO, con il supporto organizzativo di Sintesi Education e il contributo incondizionato di Incyte, azienda molto attiva su questa patologia.\nEd è proprio il Vicepresidente e General Manager dell’azienda biofarmaceutica Incyte Italia, Onofrio Mastandrea a spiegare con che spirito l’azienda ha deciso di partecipare all’iniziativa di SIDeMaST:\n“In Incyte crediamo che il ruolo di un’azienda vada oltre lo sviluppare e portare ai pazienti soluzioni terapeutiche innovative, ma comprenda anche una forte responsabilità sociale. Per questo, siamo costantemente impegnati al fianco della comunità scientifica e dei pazienti per promuovere e supportare iniziative capaci di generare valore per la comunità in cui operiamo. La Vitiligine Week ne è un esempio concreto.”\nPerché prenotare una visita gratuita?\nLa Vitiligine Week è un’iniziativa che nasce per promuovere la conoscenza della vitiligine; per incoraggiare il confronto con gli operatori sanitari per una migliore comprensione e gestione della malattia; per combattere lo stigma che circonda ancora chi ne è affetto.\nI centri in tutta Italia che hanno aderito sono molti. Prenota un appuntamento chiamando il Numero Verde gratuito [ 800226466](tel:800226466), attivo dal lunedì al sabato dalle 9 alle 13 e dalle 14 alle 18.",

    "text": "“The soldier above all others prays for peace,” the former American military general Douglas MacArthur once said, “for it is the soldier who must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.” But what about peace with oneself?\nMore than 120,000 U.S. veterans have died by suicide since record keeping began in 2001,\naccording to Veterans Affairs department data. Many more, in the U.S. and elsewhere, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as conflicts spiral around the world. Ukraine’s health ministry estimates that 3 to 4 million people in the country live with PTSD.\nAmid this mental health catastrophe, authorities have begun turning to psychedelics for help—and for good reason.\nOn Feb. 21, Ukraine’s special parliamentary commission responsible for the medical care of veterans and service personnel, voted to establish a working group to\nassess the effectiveness of MDMA-assisted therapy on PTSD. “We have to deal with mental health issues,” Minister of Healthcare Viktor Liashko, who still needs to sign off on the group, told Ukraine’s official parliament TV channel, “[and examine] how new methods will help quickly and qualitatively.” In December, the U.S. Congress voted to study the effects of psychedelic therapy on soldiers suffering from PTSD and traumatic brain injury. In Israel, a study that would treat Oct. 7 survivors with PTSD, including soldiers, with MDMA could get underway later this year.\nThe current conventional treatments for PTSD include cognitive behavioral therapy and the FDA-approved antidepressants\nZoloft and Paxil. Patients may also be prescribed antipsychotic medications, and benzodiazepines. But, for many veterans, these options are ineffective, and can lead to serious side-effects.\nThe adoption of psychedelic-assisted therapy could represent a tectonic shift in psychiatry around the world. Research\nsuggests that the psychedelic drug MDMA, an empathogenic stimulant also known as Molly or ecstasy, can spark changes in the brain that induce a childlike state of neuroplasticity and help forge new neural connections. (It could well be approved for PTSD by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration in August after two advanced stage trials showed significant benefits.) Researchers are also studying other psychedelics as well, like the powerful drug ibogaine.\nBut Ukraine may be at the vanguard given its wartime realities. Some soldiers have\nalready received legal ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic with some hallucinogenic effects, at private clinics. Dr. Vladislav Matrenitsky, who began working with ketamine in 2018, a year after it was permitted for medical use, is now seeking funding for a study to build on existing research in an effort to bring ketamine therapy toward mainstream healthcare in Ukraine. Underground practitioners elsewhere also provide MDMA and psilocybin therapy, which is illegal.\nMeanwhile, efforts are underway to remedy a serious shortage of therapists trained to provide the requisite support before and after psychedelic treatment. Some 15 Ukrainains attended\na psychedelic therapist training program in Sarajevo in December, convened by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, the organization behind the MDMA-assisted therapy studies in the U.S. Hundreds of mental health specialists have also signed up for an online psychedelic therapy training program with U.S. company Fluence.\nThe use of drugs by soldiers during war, both to recover and as battle stimulants, is nothing new. During World War II, the U.S. army treated soldiers suffering with “shell shock” with\nsodium amytal, or “blue heavens.” It would precipitate a deep sleep of more than 24 hours and most returned to combat within days. But the powerful sedative is addictive and has serious side-effects, and soldiers eventually stopped using it.\nMethamphetamines were\ncentral to Nazi Germany’s high octane blitzkrieg strategy, and the stimulant was also given to Japanese, U.S., and British troops to keep fatigue at bay and improve endurance. A report published in May by the Royal United Service Institute suggested that Russian soldiers in Ukraine are being given amphetamines before battle. Small numbers of Ukrainian soldiers, in the highly decentralized army, are also experimenting with ibogaine—which is a potent stimulant in low doses—to improve battle preparedness.\nBut there are concerns among experts over the use of hallucinogens by active duty soldiers, especially if intended to improve combat readiness, or in the trenches to reduce the fear of death. Research suggests that MDMA and\nketamine can help treat PTSD but more study is needed into these and other psychedelics. “We should decide wisely how we use these medicines,” Leor Roseman, a neuroscientist at the University of Exeter, told TIME. “Psychedelic therapy should not be undertaken lightly to heal soldiers and just put them back into the field.”\nFor some Ukrainians, who view the conflict with Russia in existential terms, they view the use of psychedelics primarily through a wartime lense. “It’s not a choice between war and a peaceful life for a lot of people,” Oleh Orlov, the chair of the Ukrainian Psychedelic Research Association (UPRA) and deputy director for research at the Mykola Yarmachenko Institute of Special Education and Psychology, told TIME. “It’s between existing and not existing.”\nSome Ukrainian troops have already\nreportedly returned to the frontlines after receiving psychedelic treatment. Welcome to psychedelic psychiatry’s brave new world, sanctioned or not, where much more research is needed.\nThe post\nHow Psychedelics Could Help Soldiers Overcome Trauma appeared first on TIME.",

    "title": "Guy Leo Malone",
    "text": "November 11, 1936 – July 21, 2025\nWith love and gratitude, we celebrate the life of Guy Leo Malone. Guy was a devoted husband, inspiring teacher and coach, an accomplished athlete, gifted artist, a beloved father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and friend. Guy passed away peacefully, surrounded by the family he loved.\nGuy was born on November 11th, 1936, to Maybelle Elizabeth and Don Leo Malone, and was raised in Independence, Missouri, alongside his brother Lawrence Kirk Malone. Guy’s creative talent was apparent from childhood. His intricate sketches, paintings, and hands-on projects inspired students and family alike. He never stopped creating and doodling.\nHe graduated from William Chrisman High School, where his gifts—in both athletics and art began to shine. It was there he also found the greatest joy of his life: Peggy Lee Martin, the woman who would become his sweetheart, best friend, and eventual wife of 67 years. Together for an incredible 72 years, their love story is one for the ages; a true partnership built on devotion, teamwork, and deep mutual respect.\nAfter high school, Guy attended Missouri Valley College in Marshall, MO, while Peggy stayed behind and worked at the telephone company saving every penny to help build their future. That dedication would define their marriage: steady, supportive, full of laughter, and fueled by a love that never wavered.\nGuy was a natural athlete and fierce competitor who lettered in every sport in high school—football, basketball, baseball and track and field. He continued his athletic journey in college where he was captain of the football team, threw the javelin (still holding records today), and played basketball. His achievements earned him induction into the Missouri Valley College Hall of Fame.\nThe summer before his senior year, Guy and Peggy married and moved to Marshall together. That year, their first daughter, Stacia Lee, was conceived and born on Guy’s Baccalaureate Day, the ultimate graduation gift.\nAfter college, Guy’s calling to teach and coach began. He taught Physical Education and coached football at Raytown High School, later moving to Raytown South High School. Eventually, he was recruited to Shawnee Mission South High School in Overland Park, Kansas, where his unique combination of physical strength and creative talent was unmatched: a 6’4″, 250-pound coach who could then turn around and teach a delicate art lesson with precision and care.\nIt was there, in the Shawnee Mission School District, he made his most lasting professional mark as the grandfather of the Shawnee Mission School Districts wrestling program. He founded the program and it was there his legacy of grit, growth, and perseverance was forged. He continued teaching art, which included but was not limited to; photography, drawing, painting, jewelry making and sculpture. He eventually became Head of the Fine Arts Department after earning his master’s degree in Kirksville, Missouri. Guy taught and inspired students for over 52 years. Upon his retirement he was honored with the Shawnee Mission South wrestling room being named after him and was inducted into the Shawnee Mission South Hall of Fame.\nGuy also never stopped moving. A lifelong athlete, he continued working out regularly well into his late 70s, setting a powerful example of strength and vitality for his children and grandchildren.\nFamily was everything to Guy. He and Peggy raised three children: Stacia Shinaberry , Troy Malone (Monique), and Sydney Whalley (Chris), who, in turn, gave him a full and joyful legacy of grandchildren: Carrine Spinks (Amanda), David Scherbarth (Erin), Jarett Malone (Kristina), Justin Malone (Kaytlyn), Jordan Malone (Bethany), Molly Malone (Zane), and Mike Viglione (Keelee).\nHe was “Grandad” to a lively, loving crew of great-grandchildren: Jolee Spinks , Micah Viglione , Juleein Ebaben , Ella , and Ruby Malone , Jameson Malone , and Calliope Clark .\nGuy was a tireless provider making the most of his summers over the years to work a multitude of different jobs including; several summers for Bekins Moving and Storage, teaching at the SMS Kids Summer Enrichment Camps, and even helping Peggy with her real estate business—getting his own license becoming her most trusted partner. He never sought the spotlight, but he was always the steady hand, the strong back, the wise heart behind the scenes.\nHe was preceded in death by his beloved parents Don and Maybelle Malone, his brother Kirk, and his grandson Courtney Spinks.\nAs a friend once said:\n“Your dad pretty much nailed it in life. He raised three great kids. He was married forever to the love of his life. He inspired and changed the lives of so many through teaching and coaching. He managed his money well and lived with a very, very caring family around him. He really did one hell of a job.”\nYes, he did.\nA celebration of Guy’s life will be set for a future date yet to be announced.\nObituary published by Charter Funerals .",
