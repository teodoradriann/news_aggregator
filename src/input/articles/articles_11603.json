    "text": "Driving conditions are hazardous across many parts of Finland on Friday due to a series of sleet and snow showers. Fintraffic's regional office in Tampere has warned of especially challenging road conditions in the area, while the Finnish Meteorological Institute has issued a hazardous driving conditions warning for southern and central regions — which is in effect until 6am on Saturday morning. Conditions are particularly bad in the regions of Kanta- and Päijät-Häme, Kymenlaakso and Pirkanmaa, the FMI noted. \"Now is the time to change to the friction or studded winter tyres, if someone hasn't done it yet. Now it's definitely winter tyre time nationwide,\" Kimmo Fager of Fintraffic said. Matthew Schilke of Yle News explained the new regulations around winter tyres in an Instagram reel. Temperatures drop to -17 in Lapland Thursday night was the coldest of the season so far, with the temperature dropping to -16.7 degrees Celsius in Sodankylä, Finnish Lapland, according to the FMI. Despite the subzero temperatures, driving conditions in the region of Finnish Lapland are relatively good, Fintraffic noted. The forecast for the weekend suggests cloudy conditions in many parts of the country, with rain showers in the south and east. Temperatures during the day on Saturday will range from 5 degrees Celsius in the south to -2 in Finnish Lapland. The outlook for next week is for milder temperatures, with no more snow in the forecast. Users with an Yle ID can leave comments on our news stories. You can create your Yle ID via this link .

    "text": "The Guardian Arsenal’s title hopes hit as old boy Mavropanos seals West Ham win Read full article Jacob Steinberg at the Emirates Stadium 29 December 2023 at 0:17 am · 5-min read Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters\nThis was not the reunion that Arsenal envisaged. On a night when West Ham ’s discipline and tremendous work ethic turned the Emirates Stadium into a pit of frustration, Declan Rice found himself powerless to resist as the narrative shifted to the goal from Konstantinos Mavropanos that raises further doubts over his old side’s staying power in the title race.\nMikel Arteta has every reason to be concerned after a defeat that dashed Arsenal’s hopes of returning to the top of the Premier League. Statistics showing his side had 74% possession and finished a taut encounter with 30 shots to West Ham’s five spoke less of their dominance and more to their toothlessness and indecision in the final third. As Arteta acknowledged, supremacy in the middle hardly feels relevant when it is accompanied by such a lack of conviction in both boxes.\nRelated: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham: Premier League – live reaction\nBy full-time Arsenal, who remain two points behind Liverpool and three ahead of Manchester City , had managed 77 touches in West Ham’s area. Two went to Gabriel Jesus , only for the hard-running No 9 to spurn a couple of glorious headed chances midway through the second half.\nThey were pivotal moments, the kind that might have turned the game on its head, but there is a reason why City let Jesus go. Their view was that the striker was not potent enough and, for all the Brazilian’s excellent work off the ball, it is easy to understand the argument about Arsenal needing more firepower in January.\nAt the moment they look reliant on Bukayo Saka , a weakness that West Ham exploited by crowding the winger out. Gabriel Martinelli , who was marked out of the game by the outstanding Vladimir Coufal, is simply not offering any threat on the opposite flank. Martinelli has only two league goals this season and, with Kai Havertz missing through suspension, the use of Leandro Trossard in midfield was not enough to break West Ham down.\nThis was a solid, committed performance from West Ham, who rose to sixth after consecutive 2-0 wins against Arsenal and Manchester United . For David Moyes, who celebrated his first league win in 73 attempts away against Arsenal, Chelsea , Liverpool and United, it was a tactical triumph.\nStory continues Time to give him a new deal? The evidence is compelling. West Ham may lack glamour but nobody can accuse them of being a soft touch under Moyes. They fought for everything after snatching the lead through Tomas Soucek and, having survived a storm before half-time, were in the clear when Mavropanos, a centre-back who made little impact before leaving Arsenal in 2022, headed in James Ward-Prowse’s corner early in the second half.\nMavropanos’s first goal since joining West Ham from Stuttgart hit Arsenal hard. They were under pressure after wins for City and Liverpool earlier in the week. They were desperate for an early goal. Martin Ødegaard linked with Saka, who tested Alphonse Areola . Emerson Palmieri, West Ham’s adventurous left-back, would have to dig deep against Saka.\nWest Ham had conceded five in each of their previous two away outings and were without Nayef Aguerd and Kurt Zouma in central defence. Deputising for Aguerd and Zouma were Mavropanos and Angelo Ogbonna , the pairing that started when West Ham were demolished by Liverpool in the Carabao Cup.\nA notable feature, though, was the tenacious Edson Álvarez dropping back to help West Ham’s defence. They soon tiptoed forward. Lucas Paquetá, who had started despite injuring a knee during the warm-up, took over, spinning cleverly before finding Emerson’s overlapping run.\nThe left-back’s cross caught Arsenal out. Jarrod Bowen missed it at the near post but Gabriel Magalhães and Oleksandr Zinchenko were in a muddle. The ball came back to Bowen, who pulled it back from the byline for Soucek to score from close range.\nThere would be no reprieve from VAR for Arsenal, no replay to show the ball had gone behind before being funnelled to Soucek, and the anxiety rose. It grew further when Areola tipped Saka’s header over and Martinelli shot wide.\nWest Ham were hit when Paquetá went down again, depriving the visitors of their most accomplished player on the ball. Retaining possession was harder with Saïd Benrahma on. Arsenal upped the pace. Saka hit woodwork after wriggling through. Soucek and Ogbonna made vital blocks.\nDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.\nIf you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.\nIn the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.\nTurn on sport notifications.\nIt had been 45 minutes of pure Moyesball. Mohammed Kudus worked tirelessly on West Ham’s right, tracking back and occasionally relieving pressure with neat footwork. Arsenal struggled to find space. Rice shot over from 20 yards but openings were rare after half-time and the angst grew when Mavropanos, running across Magalhães, met Ward-Prowse’s delivery with a header that went in off the bar.\nArsenal’s response came from Jesus wasting headers and Trossard firing at Areola’s legs. There was time for Rice to concede a penalty for fouling Emerson. David Raya ’s save from Benrahma was of little consolation to Arsenal.\nTRENDING 1. Experience: I’m a world champion pea thrower 2.

    "text": "La sanità con le sue lunghe liste di attesa, le infrastrutture \"con un aeroporto che perderà i voli di continuità territoriale\", una crescita economica \"tra le più basse di Italia\", un piano casa \"inesistente\", povertà in crescita nelle Marche e gli sfollati del terremoto di Ancona del 9 novembre dello scorso anno \"ancora senza risposte\". Sono le falle elencate dal gruppo assembleare del Partito Democratico per la giunta del governatore Francesco Acquaroli. Un bilancio del 2023 come \"un anno di fallimenti, uguali ai due precedenti\" secondo i dem. Il capogruppo Maurizio Mangialardi ha definito l'attuale giunta \"un disastro\" con un presidente \"nervoso e stizzato che ha lasciato l'aula senza nemmeno salutare\". Secondo il capogruppo, la salute rischia \"di non essere più un diritto fondamentale e universale ma un privilegio per pochi\" con un sistema sanitario regionale che nega \"nega prestazioni a malati oncologici, a bambini cardiopatici, con i pronto soccorso che esplodono\". A rincarare la dose sul tema il consigliere Romano Carancini, vicepresidente della Commissione Salute, polemico sulla nomina del sottosegretario Aldo Salvi \"per commissariare di fatto l'assessore Saltamartini\". Bocciato il passaggio delle aree vaste ad aziende sanitarie territoriali, che doveva far funzionare meglio il Cup, ma che \"sono mesi che non dà risposte, abbiamo le liste d'attesa tra le peggiori in Italia\". La segretaria Pd Marche Chantal Bomprezzi ha puntato il dito sull'esecutivo Acquaroli, \"che non si rapporta più con il territorio\". Per Fabrizio Cesetti, \"il diritto alla salute sancito dalla Costituzione non è più garantito, il piano socio sanitario non stanzia le risorse necessarie\". La vice presidente del gruppo Pd Anna Casini ha sottolineato l'inutilità della legge urbanistica perché \"inapplicabile e dannosa, Province e Comuni hanno chiesto chiarimenti perché non riescono ad applicarla\". Una Regione che \"fa finta di niente anche per gli esodati del superbonus\" ha insistito. E in tema di sanità, secondo la consigliera Micaela Vitri, \"la giunta Acquaroli non e riuscita ad uilizzare nemmeno la metà dei fondi disponibili per la riduzione delle liste di attesa\". Nelle Marche le donne attenderebbero fino a 251 giorni per una mammografia bilaterale. Il consigliere Antonio Mariovincenzo ha chiarito che aumentano gli occupati \"ma con contratti precari, mal retribuiti e di breve periodo\". L'industria manifatturiera regionale \"chiude il terzo trimestre con atività produttiva e commerciale in calo\". Marche all'ultimo posto in Italia per imprese giovanili. Per le infrastrutture è stata la consigliera Manuela Bora a sottolineare che \"il servizio aereo su Milano, Roma e Napoli non è economicamente sostenibile, fallito l'obiettivo di far uscire le Marche dall'isolamento\". Il gruppo ha fatto un elenco di \"13 promesse disattese\" dove rientrano, oltre l'abbattimento delle liste di attesa, anche \"il contrasto alla denatalità, la formazione per creare occupazione, la cultura e l'ambiente\".

    "text": "In a heartfelt initiative during Black History Month and American Heart Month, the L.A. Rams teamed up with Edwards Lifesciences to offer free heart screenings at Faithful Central Bible Church in Inglewood. This event, part of a broader effort to combat heart disease—a leading cause of death in the U.S.—focused on the African American community, which is disproportionately affected by this condition. Dr. Cedric Cravens, from Edwards Lifesciences, emphasized the importance of education and awareness to tackle heart and heart valve diseases.\nScreening for a Stronger Heart\nThe event boasted two informational sessions on heart health, alongside screenings that included blood pressure checks, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms. Experts like Dr. Tiffany Randolph, a non-invasive cardiologist, highlighted lifestyle changes and awareness as key factors in preventing cardiovascular disease. The involvement of the Rams and Edwards Lifesciences underlined the critical need for community engagement and support in addressing health disparities, particularly in underserved communities.\nCommunity Impact and Awareness\nGeorge B. Thompson, a pastor at Faithful Central Bible Church, and attendees like Nannette Griggs highlighted the significance of such initiatives. They noted the essential role of education and the power of community support to extend the reach and impact of health interventions. The event not only provided vital health screenings but also fostered a sense of unity and collective action towards better health outcomes in the African American community.\nBridging Health Disparities\nEvents like these underscore the importance of addressing social determinants of health and the disparities in access to care. Research shows that community-based interventions and a team-based approach to cardiovascular care can significantly improve health outcomes in underserved populations. Moreover, resources like those provided by East Alabama Health offer valuable guidance for the African American community on leading healthier lives and mitigating the risks of heart disease.\nThe initiative by the L.A. Rams and Edwards Lifesciences in Inglewood stands as a beacon of hope and a model for future health-focused community outreach. It highlights the crucial role of awareness, education, and proactive health management in bridging the gap in healthcare disparities, especially among African Americans. By fostering community engagement and providing free access to essential health screenings, this initiative moves us closer to a future where health equity is a reality for all.",

    "text": "Raúl Asencio está dispuesto a asegurar su futuro en el Real Madrid , con un nuevo contrato a largo plazo se espera que se firme en las próximas semanas.\nAsencio, de 21 años, ha sido uno de los jugadores más destacados del equipo de Carlo Ancelotti esta temporada, en la que ha dado un paso al frente en medio de las lesiones de los veteranos de su puesto.\nSegún Fabrizio Romano el acuerdo está casi cerrado y solamente faltan algunos detalles. Tanto el club como el jugador están deseosos de continuar su vínculo, y no hay dudas de que el acuerdo se alcanzará pronto.\nPor qué Real Madrid está convencido de renovar el contrato de Raúl Asencio Asencio ha desempeñado un papel crucial para el Real Madrid esta temporada, sobre todo en la ausencia de Éder Militao y David Alaba, que han luchado con lesiones de larga duración.\nAncelotti ha tenido que recurrir a Antonio Rüdiger como única presencia constante en la zaga, y Asencio ha demostrado ser un compañero fiable.\nSus actuaciones en partidos clave, como los choques de Champions League contra Manchester City y Atlético de Madrid, le han dado la confianza del cuerpo técnico.\nSegún Squawka, Asencio no cometió faltas, ganó sus nueve duelos y completó 95/100 pases en esos dos partidos de la UCL, y eso sin Rudiger al lado.\nNo Rüdiger, no problem. 😀\nRaúl Asencio stepped up against Atlético Madrid and Man City in the last two games, winning 100% of his duels in both matches.\n◉ 5/5 duels won vs. Atleti\n◉ 4/4 duels won vs. Man City\nHe also won all four of his tackles, completed 95 of his 100… pic.twitter.com/7Oxn5TAC07\n— Squawka (@Squawka) February 12, 2025 A pesar de que su actual contrato expira en 2026, el Real Madrid quiere asegurar su futuro por un período más largo, asegurando la estabilidad en su línea defensiva.\nRomano se refirió al acuerdo: \"Los últimos detalles se concretarán en las próximas semanas, pero no hay dudas por ambas partes. Asencio firmará un nuevo contrato en el club\".\nEl defensor está totalmente comprometido con el club blanco. Los informes sugieren que su \"único deseo es triunfar en el Real Madrid\", lo que refuerza aún más la confianza del club a la hora de ofrecerle un contrato ampliado.\nCon 29 partidos esta temporada, 20 de ellos como titular, Asencio ha demostrado su valía en los grandes escenarios. Su reciente convocatoria con la selección española pone de manifiesto su rápido ascenso y su creciente reputación.\nLos fanáticos del Real Madrid estarán encantados de ver a otro joven talento comprometiendo su futuro con el club, especialmente en una temporada en la que la profundidad de la plantilla se ha puesto a prueba debido a las lesiones.",

    "title": "PARQUES ACUÁTICOS EN GALICIA | Cinco parques acuáticos preto de Santiago para combater a calor este verán",
    "text": "Con la llegada porfin del buen tiempo a Galicia, muchos comenzamos a hacer planes en familia en los que las actividades al aire libre son las protagonistas. Y es que en nuestra comunidad, además de las playas de los 1.498 km de costa y la multitud de parajes que encontramos bañados por los ríos, hay otra muy buena opción para combatir el calor: los parques acuáticos. Una actividad ideal para el disfrute con los más pequeños de la casa y cuya demanda aumenta que cada año. A continuación te hacemos una recomendación de cinco de los más cercanos a Santiago de Compostela. El Aquapark de Cerceda, situado en la provincia de A Coruña, es el más popular de Galicia. Estrenó la temporada el 10 de junio y permanecerá abierto todos los días hasta el próximo mes de septiembre. Se trata de un parque con varios toboganes, piscinas con chorros de agua y atracciones a las que acompaña una gran zona verde. Consulta disponibilidad y precios clickando en este enlace. Aunque los parques acuáticos suelen estar relacionados con recintos llenos de piscinas y toboganes, lo cierto es que de un tiempo para aquí, existen aquellos que temporalmente se instalan en algunos arenales como es el caso del de Sanxenxo. Ubicado en la playa de Baltar, consta de un área de más de 1.750 metros cuadrados, lo que lo convierte en el parque flotante más grande de España. Este recinto lleva abierto al público desde el pasado 15 de junio, y puedes consultar disponibilidad y precios clickando en este enlace. Gestionado por la empresa compostelana Osventos, Galicia cuenta este verano con un nuevo aquapark a pleno rendimiento. Situado en Pereiro de Aguiar (Ourense), abrió sus puertas en agosto de 2023, tras un retraso en las obras provocado por la demora en la entrega de los materiales debido a la crisis que provocó la guerra en Ucrania. El pasado año se inauguraba parte del complejo, al que este verano se unen varios toboganes con diferente alturas y velocidades. Localizado en el norte de Portugal, a dos horas y media de Santiago, se encuentra uno de los parques acuáticos más famosos del país vecino: el de Amarante. Abierto en 1994, desde entonces su oferta de entretenimiento ha ido aumentando poco a poco. Entre sus instalaciones, cuenta con diferentes atracciones como una piscina de olas, toboganes en forma de tubo cubierto, áreas con chorros de agua o diferentes toboganes con giros y su apertura. El parque abrió sus puertas el pasado viernes 31 de mayo, con lo que ya puedes consultar disponibilidad y precios clickando en este enlace. Muy cerca del de Amarante encontramos otra fantástica opción. Hablamos del Naturwaterpark, ubicado junto de la localidad portuguesa de Vila-Real -a unas dos horas y media de Compostela- y que entró en funcionamiento el pasado jueves 30 de mayo en horario de 10:00h. a 18:30h. Además de la zona acuática, que consta de atracciones únicas como el Boomerang o el Péndulo, el complejo ofrece también un parque de aventuras, zona de acampada y mini golf.

    "text": "GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert's decision to ditch her home district won't solve a problem likely to haunt the Colorado Republican like Beetlejuice, according to a new political analysis. The Independent's John Bowden argued on Thursday that the firebrand's flight to Colorado's District 4 — and away from [two well-funded competitors in District 3 ](https://www.rawstory.com/lauren-boebert-campaign-2666806788/)— does not mean Boebert will face an easy campaign in 2024. \"She’s the only incumbent House member running (so far?), giving her an advantage in name recognition and an established base of support in the state,\" Bowden writes. \"Those advantages are not ironclad by any means.\" Also read: [Kari Lake hits Nikki Haley in fight for VP: Trump 'would pick anybody over her'](https://www.rawstory.com/kari-lake-nikki-haley/) Boebert may be the only incumbent House member running so far, but the name recognition she brings comes with its own burdens, Bowden argues. \"The congresswoman’s undignified exit from a live-action performance of Beetlejuice earlier this year earned her viral ridicule on an entirely new level,\" writes Bowden, \"including [a round of mockery](https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/2023/10/late-night-tv-hosts-return-with-jokes-about-donald-trump-taylor-swift-lauren-boebert-and-more.html) from America’s late-night hosts.\" Boebert is opting to run for the seat currently occupied by Republican colleague, Ken Buck, who has announced he will retire. In an online video statement, Boebert said she did not arrive at the decision easily. “A lot of prayer, a lot of tough conversations and a lot of perspective convinced me that this is the best way I can continue to fight for Colorado, for the conservative movement and for my children’s future,” she said.
