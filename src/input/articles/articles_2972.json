    "title": "Celsius Network gets green light for Bitcoin mining",
    "text": "Cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network has received the green light to make a strategic shift into [bitcoin mining](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-mine-bitcoin/), following approval from a [U.S.](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-congress-has-had-a-very-dramatic-year/) bankruptcy judge. The decision represents a significant pivot for the company, which had originally aimed to earn fees from validating crypto transactions but had to alter its course after encountering regulatory obstacles. Here’s a closer look at Celsius Network’s bold move into the world of bitcoin mining. A Judge’s Approval for a New Direction In a recent ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan granted Celsius Network the ability to deviate from its previously approved bankruptcy plan. This decision came after the company faced challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Judge Glenn determined that the new restructuring would not negatively impact creditors or customers, thus allowing Celsius Network to proceed with its bitcoin mining venture. Celsius Network’s journey to bitcoin mining began when it filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2022. This move was in line with several other crypto lenders who faced financial difficulties amidst the rapid growth of the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, Celsius had grand plans to generate revenue by validating crypto transactions and exploring new business avenues. However, the SEC’s rejection of this plan prompted a strategic shift. The change in direction also meant that the lender would no longer work with certain outside bidders who were initially chosen to oversee the new company. Instead, the responsibility for running the creditor-owned mining business fell squarely on the shoulders of mining company US Bitcoin Corp. Celsius’ Fahrenheit Consortium US Bitcoin Corp, founded by Hut 8’s Asher Genoot, was originally part of a consortium of bidders known as “Fahrenheit.” This consortium also included Arrington Capital and was intended to manage Celsius Network alongside other companies. However, with the pivot to bitcoin mining, Celsius parted ways with these bidders, leaving US Bitcoin Corp as the primary manager. While the shift in focus was deemed significant by some creditors and the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog, Judge Glenn ultimately approved the deal without calling for a new vote by creditors. Despite initial concerns that this change was not in line with what creditors had originally voted on, Celsius Network was granted the opportunity to move forward with its bitcoin mining plans. Celsius Network now looks ahead to emerging from bankruptcy in early 2024. The company’s scaled-back bankruptcy plan not only allows for the pursuit of bitcoin mining but also frees up $225 million in cryptocurrency assets. These assets were initially intended to fund new business lines that were rejected by the SEC. Benefits for Customers As a result of this strategic pivot, more cryptocurrency assets from Celsius will be returned to customers. Additionally, customers will receive equity shares in the new bitcoin mining venture. This move represents a unique approach to bankruptcy restructuring, one that aims to ensure that creditors and customers are not left in a worse position. Celsius Network’s foray into bitcoin mining is a testament to the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory challenges continue to shape the sector, companies are finding innovative ways to adapt and thrive. This bold move by Celsius Network signals its determination to explore new opportunities in the world of digital assets.",

    "text": "HGTV star Dave Marrs is showing his gratitude. The “Fixer to Fabulous” star woke up on January 14 to find fresh snow around his Bentonville, Arkansas home, along with below-freezing temperatures, with the air temperature hitting below-zero degrees Fahrenheit at its lowest points.\nSince Dave and his wife/co-host Jenny Marrs live on a farm with a plethora of animals, one side effect of the cold weather was the freezing-over of the animals water supply, a matter Dave dealt with in a\nJanuary 14 Instagram post. “We only have a small farm, and the work never ends; no matter how hot or 🥶 cold out. The animals need water, which means cutting ice. Right about now, I’m wishing for that Arkansas August heat! Stay safe out there,” Dave captioned his post.\nDave’s post included a video of the HGTV star taking a chainsaw to a patch of ice to free up the water beneath, with the caption “How did we get here so quick!!!! 🥶🥶🥶Thank you to all the farmers and ranchers out there who can’t take a day off!” written over the video.\nFans Share Dave Marrs’ Gratitude\nFans jumped into Dave’s comment section to echo his feelings of gratitude towards farmers and ranchers who were hard at work despite the below-zero forecast, and some even extended that gratitude towards Dave himself.\n“And here I was worried about getting bird seed in my feeders. Amen to thanks to anyone who has animal farms! ❤️” one fan wrote.\n“I’m wishing for a little warmer weather here too! We have around 15 below temps here and wind chills around 35 to 40 below. Yikes! We just busted ice out of water pails for our animals and that’s even in the barn. 🥶” another fan shared.\n“Unless you are a farmer or have family that farms, people really do not understand. I have extended family that farms. They all take one day off when I was a kid to go see a Cubs game. One. Day,” a third user added.\n“I can just hear Jenny Marrs voice during that. Dave. DAve DAVE MARRS ( louder and louder ) and Dave just smiling back at her with reassurance. Be safe Marrs family,” one fan wrote, referencing Dave standing on ice as he was cutting it in his video post.\nJenny Marrs Shared Her Own Message of Gratitude\nWhile Dave was hard at work making sure their family’s animals were being taken care of, Jenny was practicing self-care with two of her close friends. “Two of my dearest friends in all the world flew in for the weekend and we stayed at The Welcome Inn together,” Jenny explained in a\nJanuary 15 Instagram post.\nWhile Jenny and her girlfriends usually go away to a new city on their annual trip, she mentioned her friends offered to visit her in Bentonville as she was exhausted from a busy year of renovation, filming “Fixer to Fabulous”, and\nreleasing and promoting her first book “House + Love = Home”.\n“It was the absolute best gift because they also know how anxious I get to fly – and they do too – but they did it anyway. I can’t get over their selflessness to care for me in a way I didn’t realize I needed until they were here,” Jenny shared.\nREAD NEXT:\nBryan Baeumler Announces Fate of ‘Renovation Resort Showdown’",

Lo ha annunciato la stessa franchigia statunitense. Il problema di salute è stato diagnosticato \"al ritorno di Wembanyama a San Antonio dopo l'All Star Game a San Franscisco\", dove il giocatore ventunenne ha partecipato lo scorso fine settimana per la prima volta nella sua carriera, ha precisato la franchigia texana in un comunicato. Il rientro in campo è previsto ad aprile, quando la stagione regolare sarà già conclusa. E difficilmente gli Spurs si qualificheranno per i playoff. Il francese potrebbe però disputare Euro-2025 con la sua nazionale dal 27 agosto al 14 settembre: i blues sono impegnati con Lettonia, Cipro, Finlandia e Polonia..",

He was convicted of felony first-degree assault back in 2018, and received 13-years, but a judge suspended the entire sentence.\nRamatoulay was instead placed on five-years supervised probation, which records say he violated twice, yet remained free anyway.\nRamatoulay is currently being held without bail.

    "text": "Ну, что же, поклонники 37-летней оперной дивы Аиды Гарифуллиной дождались неопровержимых доказательств, что певица вышла замуж за 37-летнего актера Алексея Воробьева.\n«Девушка, можно с вами познакомиться?»\nНакануне Алексей выложил на своей странице в соцсети первое совместное видео с Аидой. Для этого он выбрал тренажерный зал. Шагая по беговой дорожке, Алексей направил камеру на соседнюю дорожку, по которой шла Аида. «Девушка, можно с вами познакомиться?», — поинтересовался Воробьев. На что Аида, улыбаясь, показала на свое обручальное кольцо. «Ох, умеете же вы отшить», — деланно сокрушаясь, ответил Алексей. В ответ супруга послала Алексею воздушный поцелуй.\nПара расписалась в апреле в Москве, не афишируя это событие. Все было настолько келейно, что в СМИ эта новость со ссылкой на окружение супругов просочилась лишь спустя пару месяцев. До сего дня Алексей и Аида не сочли нужным как-то комментировать свои отношения.\nВсю последнюю неделю Алексей и Аида выкладывали фото из одних и тех же локаций. В том числе с одной яхты, но в кадр вдвоем намеренно не попадали. Наблюдательные поклонники сделали вывод, что Аида и Алексей проводят отпуск на Ибице.\n«Когда она поет, я танцую даже с гантелями»\nЗаслуженная артистка России Аида Гарифуллина родилась в Казани в семье дирижёра Ляйли Гарифуллиной и бизнесмена Эмиля Гарифуллина. Вокальный дар проявился у Аиды с детства. Музыкальное образование она получила в России и за рубежом. Выступала в дуэте с Андреа Бочелли и другими оперными звёздами. В 2016 году сыграла эпизодическую роль оперной певицы, появившись на сцене в фильме «Примадонна», где звездами были Мерил Стрип и Хью Грант. У певицы есть дочь Оливия. Имя отца девочки неизвестно широкой публике. Для Аиды брак с Алексеем первый.\nПро личную жизнь Алексея известно больше — он встречался с Анной Чиповской, Оксаной Акиньшиной и Викторией Дайнеко. Был одним из героев четвёртого сезона проекта «Холостяк», который не привел к серьезным отношениям. Снимался в кино и сериалах, всего за его плечами 30 киноработ. Последние годы часто бывает в США, объясняя это тем, что в 2011 году подписал контракт с американским продюсером.\nНа первом совместном видео из спортзала Алексей танцует, держа в руках гантели, — за кадром Аида напевает один из англоязычных хитов, но не выдерживает и начинает смеяться. Воробьев подписал фото: «Когда она поет, я танцую даже с гантелей».",

    "text": "Grand Theft Auto VI was revealed with an incredible trailer that broke records and delighted all fans of the franchise. Some fans decided to make their own version of the trailer in the locations where Rockstar Games was inspired to create the world of the new installment. The result is a live-action trailer that delighted the community and that, surely, will also bring a smile to the developers of the title. As you can imagine, the project by youtuber Andrew Levitt caught the attention of many and currently already has thousands of views. Youtuber makes live-action version of the first trailer of GTA VI Levitt and his collaborators pored over every frame of the GTA VI trailer, which is full of interesting city details. In this way they searched for and found the places that inspired certain of the scenes in Rockstar's official video. Subsequently, they visited them to make a few recordings. In addition, they recreated the social media posts that appear in the trailer, the driving scenes, the final store robbery, and there is even a special appearance of the Florida Joker. The people who give life to Lucia and Jason, the main characters of the game, did a great job, as they recreate their personalities very well and even add funny details to the video, such as the bananas they use as guns in the final scene. The result surprised all fans of the franchise, who believe that the video captures the essence and atmosphere of GTA VI very well. We won't tell you more and we leave you the live-action trailer below:",
