    "text": "ANFIELD, LIVERPOOL // Liverpool moved seven points ahead of Chelsea, capitalizing on the West London side's defeat to Fulham by putting Leicester City to the sword in the Anfield fog.\nJordan Ayew finished well to open the scoring inside the first few minutes of the game but it was Liverpool bombarding Jakub Stolarczyk's goal with shots. Eventually, Cody Gakpo curled a brilliant equalizer into the back of the net after cutting inside from the left, scoring to make it 1-1 just before half-time.\nIt took only a couple of minutes of the second half for Curtis Jones to put Liverpool in front after a lengthy VAR check. And when Mohamed Salah found the bottom corner, the result was done.\nWinners\nGakpo continued his good form in the final third and Jones getting on the scoresheet again while playing as the number 10 can only be a good thing too. The strength of the Liverpool bench, with Federico Chiesa back and Luis Diaz rested, was another big bonus. Moving seven points clear at the top of the table, it was a winning day all around for the Reds.\nLosers\nDarwin Nunez would have wanted to score while he was handed a rare chance to start a game but he missed a couple of opportunities and was caught offside a couple of times too. It wasn't a bad showing, but it wasn't the start of the number nine pecking order changing either. Arne Slot was giving him plenty of positional instructions from the sidelines.\nPlayer ratings\nAlisson Becker (6). Beaten by a good early finish that left him with no chance down low to his right. The Brazilian wasn't hugely involved apart from that, which is a familiar situation for him.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold (6). Caught out of position in the move that led to the Ayew goal and was slow to get back a couple of times against Stephy Mvididi, who is a tricky customer. Some of his crossing was sensational but some of his passes didn't hit the mark.\nJoe Gomez (7). Commanding and front-footed in his challenges and usually good in possession, too. Patson Daka didn't get much change out of him. Harshly booked for the most minimal of fouls.\nVirgil van Dijk (7). Like Gomez and Alisson, he did what he needed to do. Aside from that, there wasn't much more to report on. His passing ability is useful in matches like these but the big switch wasn't often on because of how compact the Foxes were.\nAndy Robertson (6). Turned a little easily on the opening goal and didn't always make the most of the opportunities that he had to cross when he was in good positions. Solid enough defensively.\nBuy the new Nike Liverpool home shirt here\nThe new Liverpool home shirt for the 2024/2025 season features a chrome yellow pattern design and is a modern take on the legendary '84 home shirt - a season which saw the Reds become European Champions for the fourth time in Rome and the first English Club to win a treble of major honours. You can buy it now.\n£60-£125\nLiverpool FCRyan Gravenberch (7). The Dutchman is really useful in every game, but especially in matches where there is a low block to break down. He kept things ticking here and ensured there was sustained pressure. Eventually, that was going to tell.\nAlexis Mac Allister (6). It was a quiet-ish performance from the Argentine. He kept things simple but this wasn't his most influential game. It didn't need to be.\nCurtis Jones (7). Took the ball impressively on the half-turn a couple of times but sometimes got a bit crowded out in the middle of the field. Scored the goal to put Liverpool in front and could have got another with a good break into the box.\nMohamed Salah (7). Leicester kept him pretty quiet for the most part but eventually, he was able to score. There was little to no space to run into and he couldn't quite carve out enough of an angle on a couple of occasions. Sealing the game with Liverpool's third goal, though, Leicester finally couldn't get close enough to snuff out his threat.\nDarwin Nunez (6). Wasn't particularly involved in the game first half and struggled for meaningful touches. In the second, that changed slightly when he held things up and began to link up with his teammates better.\nCody Gakpo (8). Scored a brilliant goal from the left hand side cutting inside onto his stronger foot. He knows how to beat his marker and his goalscoring form has been impressive this season so far. He's now into double figures in this campaign.\nSubstitutes\nDiogo Jota (6). Looking sharp off the bench again, it was a slight surprise that he didn't start in this one. He got through plenty of off-the-ball work and should be in with a shout for the weekend.\nDominik Szoboszlai (6). Booked, which means he has picked up a one-match ban. It comes at a bad time, really, considering how good he was against Spurs, and that he only came off the bench here.\nKostas Tsimikas, Wataru Endo and Harvey Elliott also came on but they appeared too late to earn a rating.",

    "title": "Elon Musk’s warning to the market takes a $82 billion bite out of Tesla—and the path forward is daunting",
    "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Chinese automakers are “extremely good.”\nTesla shares were down just over 12% on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk sounded the alarm over Chinese electric carmakers which he called the “the most competitive car companies in the world.”\nOn Tesla’s Wednesday earnings call, Musk claimed that Chinese carmakers, which include BYD, Geely, and SAIC, are “extremely good,” and could threaten other carmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere if governments do not step in.\n“Frankly, if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,” he said.\nIn addition to Musk’s China comments, slower predicted sales numbers for 2024 and uncertainty about whether the Fed would lower interest rates this year took a $82 billion bite out of Tesla’s market cap on Thursday.\nTesla did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nThe stock was trading about 12% down from the previous night’s close on Thursday afternoon, at around $182, and was down 27% year-to-date, with some market onlookers calling for it to lose its label as one of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks.\nDethroned as EV leader Earlier this month, Tesla lost its status as the world’s largest EV maker to the Warren Buffett-backed Chinese carmaker BYD, despite implementing multiple price cuts on its U.S. vehicles the prior year, in part to compete with lower-cost Chinese EVs.\nBYD keeps its costs low in part by owning every step of the supply chain, including the production of lithium batteries—the costliest component in electric vehicles. Still, some have accused BYD and other Chinese car companies of anticompetitive behavior.\nThe Biden administration has explored raising tariffs on Chinese EVs as the country continues to dominate the sector. Chinese electric vehicles are already subject to a 25% tariff in the U.S.\nInvestigators from the European Commission also plan to visit several Chinese automakers over the coming weeks as the European Union decides whether to raise tariffs on Chinese companies to protect European carmakers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in September accused Chinese automakers of benefitting from large state subsidies that keep their prices “artificially low.”\n“This is distorting our market,” she added.\nMeanwhile, Tesla is in the process of launching its own lower-cost model that could allow it to compete in a distinct category from that of its higher price tag vehicles. Musk said on Wednesday’s earnings call that production will begin on Tesla’s “next-generation” $25,000 electric vehicle in mid-2025.\nIt is still unclear whether Tesla’s success in the more expensive EV category will translate to the lower-cost EV sector, which is largely dominated by Chinese companies. Still, in terms of licensing and partnering, Musk said Wednesday that Tesla is willing to play nice with Chinese companies—for a price.\n“We’re also happy to license for self driving, perhaps license other technologies and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution,” he said.\nTesla’s drop almost equal to GM and Ford’s entire value The $82 billion decline in Tesla’s market value as of mid-afternoon on Thursday exceeds the entire valuations of both GM ($48 billion) and Ford ($45 billion), and equals around one-third that of Toyota ($270 billion). Since Tesla now confirms it won’t come anywhere near meeting its own, or Wall Street’s, expectations for either volume or margin growth in the next couple of years, the big question for investors is whether the stock’s newly discounted price accurately reflects the new, downsized expectations. The bulls will argue that at these prices, Tesla’s stock is still a good deal.\nThe numbers, however, are daunting. Though Tesla’s stock price is falling, so too are its earnings, meaning that its price-to-earnings multiple remains towering. In Q4, Tesla’s pre-tax income, excluding regulatory credits, was roughly $2 billion (after adjusting to a normalized tax rate and excluding a big one-time tax benefit). Its net earrings have fallen rapidly in the last quarters, going from $3.9 billion in Q4 of last year to $2.4 billion in Q3 before sliding once again.\nA steep climb for its stock to recover Since Tesla presented virtually now positive on the call, let’s assume that its net income is now running at the current clip of $2 billion a quarter or $8 billion a year. That puts its price-to-earnings ratio at 72. How fast must Tesla’s profits wax to grow into that still astounding valuation?\nFor inventors to pocket a 10% annual gain over the next seven years, Tesla’s market cap would need to reach $1.2 trillion by early 2031. If we assume its PE will decline to a still-formidable 30, the EV giant will need to post GAAP net earnings of $40 billion. That’s almost half of what Apple makes now, 60% of Alphabet’s current profits, and twice what Toyota’s averaged over the past three years.\nThe chances of getting anywhere near a double-digit return gets even dimmer if Musk gets his way, and the Tesla board awards him an extra 12% or 13% of Tesla equity to entice the maverick to develop an AI juggernaut for the automaker. Musk wants the shares for free as a reward for his additional services. Unlike any other stock offering, this one wouldn’t put cash for investment in Tesla’s war chest. Put simply, the move would dilute current shareholders so that instead of owning 88% of Tesla, they own 76% or 77%. Hence, their share of the hypothetical, probably mythological $1.2 trillion valuation would go from $1.05 trillion to $920 billion, cutting their return from 10% to 8.8%.\nThe last thing Tesla investors need is for Musk to raise the bar for garnering decent gains on his stock. Even the Tesla bulls must be questioning whether Elon himself sees where his stock is headed, and wants to get a lot more for free to cushion the blow.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "Katholische Grundschule: Kölner Eltern lehnen kirchliche Regeln ab",
    "text": "Mit der Nippeser Maternusschule wurde binnen anderthalb Jahren die fünfte katholische Grundschule in Köln zur Gemeinschaftsgrundschule.\nKatholische GrundschuleKölner Eltern wollen nicht mehr, dass die Kirche die Regeln macht\nDas Votum der Eltern war eindeutig: Mit überwältigender Mehrheit stimmten die Eltern der Nippeser Katholischen Maternus-Grundschule für die Umwandlung der Schule. Nach den Sommerferien wird die einzige katholische Schule im Stadtteil Nippes damit eine Gemeinschaftsgrundschule. Bei 211 abgegebenen Stimmen gab es nur sechs Nein-Stimmen. Im Schulausschuss wurde das Votum der Eltern am Montag auch formal als Umwandlungsbeschluss bestätigt.\nDamit ist die Nippeser Grundschule innerhalb der vergangenen anderthalb Jahre bereits die fünfte Kölner katholische Grundschule, die beschlossen hat, nicht länger katholisch zu sein. Neben der Michael-Ende-Grundschule in Ehrenfeld entschieden sich auch in Ossendorf die Peter-Lustig-Grundschule, die Grundschule Forststraße in Rath und die Grundschule Langemaß in Mülheim dafür.\n„Alle Familien sollen sich willkommen fühlen“\nGrundlage der Umwandlungen ist immer das Engagement der Eltern vor Ort, die das Votum in Form einer Wahl organisieren müssen. Hauptargument vieler Eltern ist, dass sie nicht mehr hinnehmen möchten, dass katholische Kinder bei der Aufnahme an der Schule bevorzugt werden. Gerade angesichts knapper Grundschulplätze in Köln finden immer mehr Eltern wichtig, dass die Kinder einen Platz bekommen, die wirklich in der Nähe wohnen. Sie wollten, „dass sich alle Familien weiterhin unabhängig von Konfession, Herkunft, sexueller Orientierung oder privater Lebensentwürfe an unserer Schule willkommen fühlen“, hieß es von Seiten der Nippeser Elterninitiative, die das Votum angestoßen hatte. Zudem seien nur noch ein Viertel der Kinder katholisch.\nIn Nordrhein-Westfalen ist derzeit noch jede dritte der 3000 Grundschulen eine konfessionelle Bekenntnisschule. In Köln sind es 43 von 151 Grundschulen. Dabei sind katholische Bekenntnisgrundschulen – anders als katholische Privatschulen wie etwa die Kölner erzbischöflichen Gymnasien – komplett in staatlicher Trägerschaft und werden zu 100 Prozent vom Staat finanziert.\nTrotzdem gibt die Kirche die Aufnahmeregeln vor. Genommen werden müssen zunächst Kinder der jeweiligen Konfession. Bei einem Anmeldeüberhang haben Kinder anderer Konfession, konfessionsfreie Kinder oder Kinder mit anderer Religionszugehörigkeit das Nachsehen, auch wenn die angemeldeten katholischen Kinder deutlich weiter entfernt von der Schule wohnen.\nAnmeldeüberhänge an vielen Grundschulen\nBrisanz hat das Thema, weil es in Köln bei einem hohen Anteil der Grundschulen Anmeldeüberhänge gibt und vor allem Grundschulplätze in Köln knapp sind. Regelmäßig von Anmeldeüberhängen betroffene Schulleitungen berichten, dass nicht-katholische Eltern da, wo Plätze knapp sind, inzwischen Sorge haben, ihr Kind dort anzumelden aus Angst vor einer Absage.\nHinzu kommt, dass an einer katholischen Grundschule die Schulleitung zwingend katholisch sein muss. Gleichzeitig sind derzeit mehr als zehn Grundschulen ohne Leitung, weil Bewerberinnen und Bewerber rar sind. Katholische allemal. Die Umwandlung in eine Gemeinschaftsgrundschule erhöht also die Chancen auf eine Stellenbesetzung in der bestehenden Mangellage, was vielerorts – gerade dort, wo eine Neubesetzung in nächster Zeit ansteht – ein Argument für Eltern ist.\nBekenntnisschulen sind in Nordrhein-Westfalen Teil der Landesverfassung. Es gibt sie allerdings außer in NRW nur noch in Niedersachsen. Dabei sind die Hürden im Umwandlungsprozess hoch: Grundschulen sind laut Schulgesetz NRW umzuwandeln, wenn sich mehr als 50 Prozent der Eltern in einer formalen Wahl dafür entscheiden. Die Sache hat allerdings einen Haken: Die Eltern, die nicht an der Wahl teilnehmen, werden als Neinstimmen gezählt.\nDie NRW-weite Initiative „Kurze Beine – Kurze Wege“ setzt sich dafür ein, dass möglichst viele katholische Bekenntnisschulen zu Gemeinschaftsgrundschulen werden. Ihr Hauptargument: Wenn die Steuerzahler die Schulen finanzieren, dürfe es nicht sein, dass bei zu vielen Anmeldungen die Schüler eines Bekenntnisses bevorzugt werden. Daher berät und unterstützt sie Schulen auf dem Weg der Umwandlung. An den umgewandelten Schulen ändert sich abgesehen von dem neuen Status nichts: Es gibt weiter konfessionellen Religionsunterricht, der durch das Wahlfach Praktische Philosophie ergänzt wird. Auch Schulgottesdienste gibt es weiterhin, ebenso wie die Feier christlicher Feste.",

    "title": "Here It Comes: California Has Declared A State Of Emergency Due To The Bird Flu, And A “Severe” Human Case Has Been Confirmed In Louisiana",
    "text": "by Michael Snyder, End Of The American Dream :\nAre we on the verge of another major public health crisis? Will we soon see the return of lockdowns, shutdowns, testing, masks and mandates? Since 2022, the H5N1 bird flu has been causing chaos all over the globe. According to NBC News , 123 million birds “have been killed or euthanized” in the United States, and a new wave of the outbreak has arrived this winter with a vengeance. That is one of the primary reasons why eggs are now so expensive all over the country. Unfortunately, the H5N1 bird flu is also spreading like wildfire among dairy cows. This month it is ripping through hundreds of dairy herds in the state of California, and as a result a state of emergency has just been declared …\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\nCalifornia has declared a state of emergency for H5N1 bird flu amid fears that the virus could jump to people and start to spread.\nThe move comes in response to a major outbreak of the virus among the state’s cattle which has spilled over and infected dozens of dairy workers.\nWhat we are witnessing in California right now is truly alarming.\nSo far, 645 dairy herds have been affected as bird flu roars across the state.\nAlmost half of those dairy herds have been hit just within the past 30 days …\nCalifornia has identified H5N1 in 645 dairy herds since its first detection in late August and nearly half of those were reported in the past 30 days, highlighting the rapid spread of the virus.\nThirty-four of the US’ 61 human bird flu cases have also been in California.\nThis is a really big deal.\nIn a previous article , I discussed the fact that piles of dead cows have been spotted “stacked along roadsides rotting in the heat” in rural parts of the state…\nA dystopian scene is emerging in California as dairy farmers battle a ruthless disease.\nDead cows and calves stacked along roadsides rotting in the heat surrounded by crows, vultures and thick swarms of black flies.\nAfter wiping out tens of millions of birds worldwide, the H5N1 avian flu is tearing through dairy farms in the US.\nWhen it was just birds that were dropping dead, most people were not too concerned.\nBut dairy cows are mammals just like us.\nAnd now dozens of humans are getting infected.\nIn fact, the very first “severe” human case of H5N1 has been confirmed in the state of Louisiana. The following comes from the official CDC website …\nA patient has been hospitalized with a severe case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus (“H5N1 bird flu”) infection in Louisiana. This marks the first instance of severe illness linked to the virus in the United States. The case was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, December 13. Since April 2024, there have been a total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States.\nPartial viral genome data of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana indicates that the virus belongs to the D1.1 genotype related to other D1.1 viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the United States and in recent human cases in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state. This H5N1 bird flu genotype is different than the B3.13 genotype detected in dairy cows, sporadic human cases in multiple states, and some poultry outbreaks in the United States. Additional genomic sequencing and efforts to isolate virus from clinical specimens from the patient in Louisiana are underway at CDC.\nWe aren’t being told much about the victim other than the fact that this particular individual is “currently hospitalized in critical condition” …\nAmerican flag merchandise “The patient is experiencing severe respiratory illness related to H5N1 infection and is currently hospitalized in critical condition,” said Emma Herrock, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Health.\nOf course this wasn’t the first such case in North America.\nLast month, a teenager in Canada had to be hospitalized after getting infected with the bird flu…\nA teenager in British Columbia was hospitalized in November after contracting the same genotype of the bird flu virus. Canadian health officials were not able to determine the source of the teen’s infection.\nRead More @ EndOfTheAmericanDream.com",

    "text": "The Federal Government has launched free Caesarean Section for Nigerian women who need the procedure, especially the poor and the vulnerable.\nCaesarean Section is a surgical procedure that involves delivering a baby through incisions on the mother’s abdomen and uterus.\nThe initiative, according to the government, is in furtherance of its commitment to reducing maternal and newborn mortality across Nigeria.\nThe Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Prof. Muhammad Pate , announced this yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing three-day Nigeria Health Sector-Wide Joint Annual Review.\nThe announcement came on the heels of the launch of the Maternal Mortality Reduction Innovation Initiative.\nThe Joint Annual Health Review aims to conduct a thorough assessment of Nigeria’s healthcare system, identifying challenges and implementing impactful solutions to ease both the physical and financial burdens on our people.\nConfirming this on the official X (formerly Twitter) handle of the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Pate said: “No woman should lose her life simply because she can’t afford a C-section.”\nThe tweet reads: “In a powerful move, Coordinating Minister @muhammadpate just announced that Cesarean Sections for all Nigerian women who need them will now be FREE!”\nRelated News The minister added that the initiative would provide free cesarean sections for eligible poor and vulnerable women, available through public and private facilities empanelled by the National Health Insurance Authority.\n“By removing financial barriers to this life-saving procedure, we ensure that no woman in need is denied critical care due to cost. Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high, with 172 local governments contributing to over 50 per cent of maternal deaths.\n“By focusing resources on these high-burden areas, MAMII (Maternal Mortality-Reduction Innovation and Initiatives) will address the greatest areas of need. The NHIA (National Health Insurance Authority), in collaboration with the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, and State Health Insurance Agencies, will manage the reimbursement process, ensuring that providers across both sectors can deliver these essential services sustainably.\n“Community health workers play a crucial role in this mission, in line with Mr. President’s initiative to onboard 120,000 additional health workers to support primary care across Nigeria. These workers are essential in generating demand for maternal care services within communities, educating families on the importance of antenatal care and ensuring that mothers are informed about available services.\n“In rural and underserved areas, where accessing healthcare facilities remain a challenge, community health workers act as vital links between families and the healthcare system, bringing lifesaving information and support to their doorsteps.\n“In these same areas, the National Emergency Medical Service and Ambulance System @Fmohnigeria have been revitalized to provide timely transport for emergencies, bridging a key gap in both maternal and newborn care by bringing emergency services closer to those who need them most,” he added.\nPate acknowledged that the initiative was made possible through the essential support of development partners, whose resources and expertise align with Nigeria’s health priorities.",

    "text": "By Carly Silva ,\n3 hours ago\nLeave it to Ginger Zee to get in touch with nature for her wardrobe choices.\nThe chief meteorologist at Good Morning America left viewers in awe of her stylish outfit during the Thursday, Sept. 19 broadcast, where she was seen sporting a stunning bird-inspired ensemble.\nZee, 43, shared photos of the look to Instagram after the show, giving her followers a glimpse at the dark teal dress that was stamped with a colorful bird pattern.\nAs seen in the social media pics—as well as footage of Zee in action while giving the day's weather report—fans got a close-up look at the long-sleeved garment, which featured depictions of vibrantly colored cardinals, hummingbirds, ducks and more recognizable birds.\nThe dress, made in a button-down style, was tied at the waist with a colorful peach, black and baby blue belt which Zee complimented with a pair of classic pink heels.\n\"I love wearing these bird dresses to hear @maxgolembo do all the bird calls. 😂,\" she wrote in her caption, while mentioning fellow meteorologist at GMA , Max Golembo .\nFans on social media absolutely adored Zee's avian style for the day, including one user who wrote in the comments, \"I just saw your dress on TV and GASPED because it’s s perfect!! 😍\"\n\"I love the way you wear it 😍,\" someone else gushed.\nAnother fan was ready to purchase their own dress just like it, telling Zee, \"Love it. I will google bird dresses.\"\nIn her Instagram post, Zee credited her dress as being from the clothing brand Lesley Evers —and it's not the first time Zee has rocked one of the unique bird styles.\nBack in August 2023 , Zee was spotted in another dress covered in birds during a Good Morning America episode. The white short-sleeved dress, also from Lesley Evers, featured a very similar design, except for the white base fabric that made the birds pop even more.\n\"🔥Only Ginger Zee could rock that dress on national TV!\" one fan wrote under Zee's Instagram post on Thursday.\n\"That dress is for the birds 😍🔥,\" someone else applauded.\nNext: Fans Can't Get Enough of Ginger Zee's 'Fabulous' and Bold New Haircut\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
