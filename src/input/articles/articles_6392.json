    "text": "The University of Tasmania has partnered with Sumday, an innovative Tasmanian-based carbon accounting platform, to enhance its sustainability-focused courses and increase the state's access to sustainable business education. The Executive Dean of the College of Business and Economics, Professor Stuart Crispin, said the partnership demonstrates the value of collaborating with new and emerging industry partners. \"As innovative businesses like Sumday emerge to tackle the social, environmental and economic challenges we face, it's essential that we work with them to develop equally as innovative graduates, teaching methods and research.\" \"This partnership will allow us to harness the expertise of a local industry leader with contemporary insights and tools to inform our approach to teaching and research in future.\" With climate skills in high demand, carbon accounting has emerged as a vital field that supports businesses, governments, and organisations to understand, measure and report on their greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately reduce their contribution to climate change. The Tasmanian School of Business and Economics (TBSE) and Sumday will collaborate to incorporate industry-leading carbon accounting expertise and technology into the University's growing suite of sustainable business courses. \"The TSBE is at the forefront of sustainable business and carbon education, and this exciting new partnership will strengthen our teaching and research, allowing us to support local businesses to achieve a global impact. \"By working with innovative and sustainability-centred industry partners like Sumday, we can ensure that our students and staff are on the cutting edge of business education in Tasmania. \"I look forward to working with Sumday to expand what it means to be an accountant in the 21st Century,\" Senior Lecturer in Climate Accounting Dr Leanne Morrison said. Sumday has a strong focus on supporting accountants to embed non-financial accounting into their service offering or within their organisation. Taking an education-first approach, Sumday provides training and support that now starts in the classroom for the next generation of accounting professionals. \"We're thrilled to be working with the University of Tasmania. The future of accounting includes carbon, therefore it's essential that we're supporting the future of the accounting profession, empowering them to enter the workforce ready to take on this enormous opportunity,\" said Lindsay Ellis, Co-Founder and Head of Accounting at Sumday. \"One of our key values at Sumday is Education First; we firmly believe education unlocks true transformation. If we're going to create a world where accounting systems have transformed the global economy into a force for good, then we need to support the students that will be leading this transition throughout their careers,\" CEO at Sumday Jessica Richmond said. As part of the partnership, students from the Tasmanian School of Business and Economics will also receive free access to Sumday's software to gain practical experience with carbon accounting tools.

We will continue to work closely with all our suppliers to ensure eggs remain available for our customers,\" a spokesperson said. \"To manage availability, we will continue to maintain the purchase limits that have been in place since the first outbreak in Victoria in 2024. \"We kindly ask our customers to consider others in their community and purchase only what they need.\" Costco was contacted for comment, but declined to provide a statement. 9news.com.au understands current limits on eggs apply. ﻿ READ MORE: Second top cop told his contract will not be renewed by the government﻿ Australians are struggling to find eggs stocked on shelves across the country,.

The outbreak reduced the number of laying hens in Australia, which unfortunately will take a while longer to rebuild,\" the spokesperson said. \"In the meantime, the egg industry is working to boost supply marketwide. \"The usual higher demand for eggs over Christmas and the New Year's period put an additional short-term strain on the availability of eggs across all retailers, however our supply remains stable. \"Our egg supply has continued to improve and we are working closely with our suppliers to source as many eggs as possible.\" Egg Farmers of Australia chief executive Melinda Hashimoto told 9news.com.au last month, that there is a national shortage.

Victoria's Acting Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Cameron Bell said staff were on the ground \"working closely with industry to contain and eradicate the virus\". Control orders remain in place restricting the movement of poultry, poultry products, equipment, and vehicles on or off properties in designated zones. The H7 strain was first detected on a poultry farm on February 8. The zones include a restricted area covering a 5km radius around the farms, with a broader control area spanning east of the Goulburn Valley Freeway and including the townships of Euroa, Violet Town, Longwood, Ruffy, Avenel and Strathbogie. \"If you are in the control or restricted areas, you cannot move birds, products (including eggs and manure) or equipment into, out of, or within the area without permit,\" Bell said. \"This includes selling or giving away eggs from your poultry – these must not leave your property.\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP : Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

    "text": "OpenAI, pioner en intel·ligència artificial, ha anunciat el retard en el llançament del seu esperadíssim GPT-5. Encara que el model estava previst inicialment per a 2024, diversos factors tècnics i estratègics han modificat els plans de la companyia, generant expectatives i preguntes sobre el futur de la IA avançada.\nOpenAI i el lideratge en IA: els desafiaments amb GPT-5\nhttps://www.elnacional.cat/ca/tecnologia/01ai-nou-tita-intelligencia-artificial-xina-busca-competir-openai_1323175_102.html ha liderat l'evolució de la intel·ligència artificial amb models emblemàtics com a GPT-3 i GPT-4. La pròxima iteració, GPT-5, prometia avenços significatius en raonament, comprensió contextual i generació de text, la qual cosa el situaria com una eina essencial per a múltiples indústries.\nTanmateix, la fase de prova coneguda com a \"Arrakis\" va destacar diverses àrees de millora i reptes inesperats. L'objectiu era refinar el model i assegurar-se que superés les capacitats dels seus predecessors, però la complexitat de l'entrenament, així com la incorporació de noves dades i mètodes, ha alentit el progrés.\nEl model havia de llançar-se a finals de 2024, però ara la companyia no ha donat una data concreta, subratllant el seu compromís amb la qualitat en lloc de complir amb terminis precipitats.\nNoves dades, mètodes d'entrenament i l'impacte en el llançament\nEl retard també es deu a canvis fonamentals en l'estratègia d'entrenament. OpenAI està utilitzant nous conjunts de dades més extensos i diverses metodologies que busquen optimitzar la comprensió semàntica i reduir errors en les respostes generades. Això ha portat a un augment significatiu en el temps i els recursos necessaris per afinar el model.\nL'objectiu d'aquestes noves tècniques és garantir que GPT-5 no només sigui més poderós, sinó també èticament responsable i menys propens a generar contingut perjudicial o esbiaixat. Aquest enfocament ha estat ben rebut per la comunitat tecnològica, encara que ha suposat un cost en temps de desenvolupament.\nEl futur amb GPT-5: més enllà del retard\nMalgrat els desafiaments actuals, OpenAI continua posicionant-se com un actor clau en el desenvolupament d'intel·ligència artificial avançada. GPT-5 promet establir un nou estàndard en interacció humà-IA, amb capacitats potencialment properes al raonament humà en diversos contextos.\nA més, la companyia assegura que el temps extra invertit serà clau per garantir un producte acabat més robust i adaptable, capaç de revolucionar encara més sectors com l'educació, la investigació i l'atenció al client.\nEncara que el retard pot haver generat expectatives frustrades, reforça la visió d'OpenAI de prioritzar l'excel·lència i la responsabilitat sobre la velocitat. Per als qui segueixen l'evolució de la intel·ligència artificial, l'espera podria valer la pena.",
