    "text": "Homosexual acts contrary to natural law - CBNC stand firm against blessing same-sex couples\nThe bishops also rejected other irregular unions, like polygamists, divorcees, and remarried individuals.\nRecommended articles\nIn a communiqué issued at the end of their First Plenary Meeting, the CBCN reaffirmed the Sacrament of Marriage as a union between one man and one woman, citing the Code of Canon Law and the Catechism of the Catholic Church.\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the first plenary meeting is with the theme, ‘Synodality and the state of the nation”. The Bishops rejected the interpretations of the “Fiducia Supplicans” declaration that suggested priests could bless same-sex couples.\nThey also rejected other irregular unions, such as those of polygamists, divorcees, and remarried individuals, in a way that legitimises such unions. The Bishops emphasised their loyalty to the teaching of Christ and the Pope, stating that priests in Nigeria are not to bless same-sex couples.\n“The CBCN’s stance reflects the Church’s longstanding position on marriage and sexual ethics, emphasising the sanctity of traditional marriage and the rejection of practices contrary to natural law.\n“The issue of blessing same-sex couples has generated a lot of controversies. Many Episcopal Conferences have taken their position on this matter.\n“We re-affirm the age long teaching of the Church on the Sacrament of Marriage as a union between one man and one-woman,” the communique read.\nIt continued: “We reject the reading of the Declaration that suggests that Priests could bless same-sex couples or other couples in irregular situations.\n“We, the Catholic Bishops of Nigeria affirm our loyalty to the teaching of Christ and the Holy Father the Pope.\n“We reiterate that Priests are not to bless same-sex couples in Nigeria.\n“Homosexual acts are acts of grave depravity which are intrinsically disordered and, above all, contrary to natural law”.\nExpressing solidarity with Nigerians amid escalating insecurity and economic challenges, the Bishops urged the government to prioritise the protection of lives and properties of its citizens.\nThey called for unity, and social responsibility, even as they affirmed that synodality, a core aspect of the Church’s nature, emphasises collective decision-making and active participation. They also recommended the creation of State Police and the enhancement of agriculture to improve the economy.\nThe Bishops also emphasised the importance of repentance and called for a sincere change of heart to address corruption and promote good governance.\nThey encouraged all Nigerians to work together for the common good and expressed hope for a brighter future, especially during the Lenten season.\n“The season of Lent allows us to start afresh with God as individuals, as a Church and as a nation.\n“This holy season draws our attention to reparation, reconciliation and sanctification. In prayer, we deepen our relationship with God.\n“In almsgiving, we demonstrate our concern for the needy and the less privileged,” they said.\nJOIN OUR PULSE COMMUNITY!\nEyewitness?

Sin embargo, los aficionados a las carreras estarán contentos con Mario Kart World como título de lanzamiento y Kirby Air Riders más adelante este año. Pero hay otro juego que se lanzará el 5 de junio, día de la llegada de la consola, que gustará a los fans de F-Zero: Fast Fusion.\nAlgunos fans de Nintendo probablemente ya conozcan la serie Fast: ha tenido tres entradas hasta ahora, en Wii, Wii U y Nintendo Switch -de hecho, fue un título de lanzamiento en marzo de 2017- y es un arcade de carreras futurista realizado por Shin'en Multimedia, autores de The Touryst o Art of Balance. Y el cuarto juego de la serie, Fast Fusion, se lanzará en exclusiva para Nintendo Switch 2 el 5 de junio, ofreciendo carreras antigravedad a 60 fps y 4K HDR.\nFast Fusion ofrecerá gráficos espectaculares, la opción de fusionar vehículos para crear tu propia combinación (un poco como Mario Kart 7 y 8) y compatibilidad con la nueva opción de Juego Compartido en Switch 2, pero también multijugador a pantalla partida para cuatro jugadores. Si quieres un juego para comprar en la eShop y echas de menos F-Zero, Fast Fusion será una gran alternativa.\nCargando más contenido",

    "text": "Commenter Réagir Envoyer par mail Envoyer Partager sur Facebook Partager Partager sur Twitter Twitter Les salariés de Boeing de la région de Seattle, aux États-Unis, ont voté à une très large majorité en faveur d’une grève dès vendredi 12 septembre, rejetant la nouvelle convention proposée par l’avionneur américain en difficulté qui s’est dit « engagé » dans la poursuite des négociations.\nLes travailleurs ont rejeté la convention à 94,6 % et voté jeudi soir la grève à 96 %, a précisé Jon Holden, président du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751.\n« Nos membres se sont exprimés haut et fort ce soir » , a affirmé Jon Holden, dont le syndicat qui représente environ 33 000 travailleurs dans la région Nord-Ouest Pacifique, avait initialement soutenu l’accord. Il avait auparavant déclaré ne pas pouvoir « garantir que nous obtiendrons davantage en faisant grève » .\nÀ lire aussi Déboires du vaisseau spatial Starliner : la série noire se poursuit pour Boeing La grève entraînera la fermeture de deux grandes usines d’assemblage d’avions dans la région de Puget Sound – les deux tiers des votes étaient nécessaires pour lancer un arrêt de travail dès l’expiration jeudi à minuit de la convention actuelle, vieille de seize ans.\nElle va paralyser la production du 737, du 777 et du 767 cargo, dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les problèmes et les retards . Une situation d’autant plus problématique que l’avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60 %) à la remise des avions.\nLa direction veut négocier En dépit du vote massif en faveur de la grève, le groupe Boeing a déclaré dans un communiqué être « engagé » dans la négociation. « Nous restons déterminés à rétablir nos relations avec nos employés et le syndicat, et nous sommes prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord » , a affirmé l’avionneur.\nLe vote de jeudi marque un rejet décisif d’un accord qui, selon les travailleurs, était bien moins généreux que ne l’affirmaient les dirigeants de Boeing.\nCette nouvelle convention, qui concerne les adhérents de l’IAM dans la région de Seattle (Nord-Ouest), prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25 % sur quatre ans ainsi qu’un engagement d’investissements dans la région. Et aussi la construction du prochain avion – annoncé pour 2035 – dans le berceau historique de l’avionneur qui devait assurer des emplois pour plusieurs décennies.\nDernière grève en 2008 Boeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève, alors que sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019, ayant coûté la vie à 346 personnes, et une multitude de problèmes de qualité de la production.\n« Ce n’est un secret pour personne : notre activité traverse une période difficile, en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (…) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune » , avait prévenu mercredi soir Kelly Ortberg, qui a succédé le 8 août à Dave Calhoun au poste de directeur général de l’avionneur américain. Il avait exhorté les employés à ne pas « sacrifier » les progrès futurs en raison de « frustrations liées au passé » .\nÀ lire aussi Redresser Boeing, la lourde charge de Kelly Ortberg Mais les mécontents jugent la hausse salariale trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+ 40 % initialement) et le volet sur les retraites insatisfaisant. Une semaine après sa prise de fonction, Kelly Ortberg s’était engagé à « réinitialiser » la relation avec l’IAM. Mais à la lecture de l’accord, de nombreux syndiqués ont réagi négativement et plaidé pour un arrêt de travail.\nLe règlement de l’IAM prévoit que les grévistes reçoivent 250 dollars (225 €) par semaine à partir de la troisième semaine d’arrêt de travail.\nBoeing fait l’objet d’une supervision accrue depuis un incident en vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d’Alaska Airlines. Survenu après une série de problèmes de conformité et de contrôle qualité, il a ravivé les questions soulevées sur ces mêmes lacunes après les deux crashs.\nLa dernière grève chez l’avionneur américain remonte à 2008 et avait duré 57 jours.",

    "title": "锻造\"未来之师\"！河北师范大学持续开展实习支教近20年_河北政策宣传解读平台-长城网",
    "text": "长城网·政策解读\n>\n40批，60500名师范生，150多个县（市、区），11000多所学校……这些数字，串起的是河北师范大学持续开展实习支教近20年的收获。\n开展师范生教育实践是教师培养的必要环节，也是教师培养质量保障的关键措施。2006年以来，河北师范大学开展以实习支教为突破口的实践型教师教育改革，收到了良好效果。\n为什么要开展实习支教？在实习过程中如何培养“未来之师”？实习支教给师范生带来了什么？\n初心如磐\n要培养“下得去”的新教师\n在临城县第二中学，陈哲围绕机器人项目进行特色课程探索，自主设计并开设机器人培训课程；为了让同学们深入了解太阳系的奥秘，代铭瑄在武强县第一实验小学用乒乓球和铁丝制造行星模型；在临漳三中，王新天因材施教，引导学生们逐步建立起物理思维……\n陈哲、代铭瑄、王新天是河北师范大学第40期实习支教师范生。今年春季开学初，河北师范大学派出包括他们在内的25个专业2538名师范生，在全省90个县（市、区）的430所学校开展实习支教。\n学校为什么要开展实习支教？\n“这还得从二十年前，学校开展的河北省农村基础教育现状调研说起。”河北师范大学副校长曾智安介绍，学校通过那次调研发现，河北农村普遍存在着师资匮乏的困境，好教师“下不去，用不上，留不下”。与此同时，学校本科师范生的教育教学实践能力也需要进一步提高。\n为此，学校从2006年3月开始正式启动实习支教工程。第一年河北师范大学派出了502名学生，深入徐水、清苑、望都、栾城、井陉、沙河、南宫、临漳、威县、藁城的121所中学，开展为期三个月的实习支教。\n“实习支教是培养基础教育合格师资的重要实践环节。把好师范生的培养关、出口关，是师范大学义不容辞的责任。”曾智安介绍，2007年4月河北师范大学正式成立顶岗支教指导中心，开始进行制度、基地、课程等规范化建设。\n为了提升实习效果，自2007年开始，实习支教从三个月调整为半年，将实习支教工程纳入教师教育课程体系，探索“2.5+0.5+1”的实践型教师教育人才培养模式——即学生先后在校内接受三年半系统的专业教育，用半年时间参加实习支教。现如今，河北师范大学实习基地已经从最初的河北10个县（市、区）发展到北京、天津、新疆及河北全域。\n“每年春秋季，学校都会对实习基地的教师需求情况进行调研，学校顶岗支教指导中心再根据需求向这些学校选派学生。实习基地实行动态管理，学校会依据实习生、驻县教师、区域主任等相关人员意见对实习基地作出综合评价，决定基地的去留。”负责基地建设的顶岗支教指导中心教师王西强说。\n近年来，河北师范大学在课程、学分、评价机制等方面进行改革，提升实践育人效果。\n让数智赋能实习支教工作，今年3月该校上线了独立研发的智慧实习平台。对实习过程性管理、指导、评价工作进行全方位数字化提升。同时，通过人工智能搭建实习指导智能体，通过大数据进行实习发展阶段能力画像，精准指导因材施教，全面提高实习效果。\n此外，学校还创新实习模式，探索以项目制为牵引，构建师范生、教育硕士、在职教师、特聘名师等协同发展的教师教育共同体。\n“目前我们已经跟鹿泉一中协同打造学科融合·泮河科创工作坊，探索科学教育发展的新路径。”一直参与鹿泉一中实习支教指导工作的顶岗支教指导中心教师于健表示。\n淬炼匠心\n“四位一体”磨炼教学真功\n“篮球原地高低手运球，要双脚分开与肩同宽，膝盖微屈……”6月3日，大名县第十一中学初一年级123班正在上篮球直播课，上课的老师是河北师范大学体育学院学生张宇航，在线听课的是河北师范大学体育学院教授田菁。\n田菁是张宇航的专业指导教师。课后，田菁从备课、教态、语言、教学重点内容把握、课堂管理等方面进行了辅导点评。\n这个班有40名学生，只有8只篮球，上课的时候，学生参与度不高。田菁点评时建议：“在器材不足的情况下，可采用分组练习的形式，提升学生的参与度。”\n张宇航认真听取田菁老师的建议，还提出了心中的疑惑：“上课时，班里有几个孩子特别调皮，不听指令该怎么办？”\n田菁指导他说：“老师应该制定明确的规则，让孩子了解自己在课堂和校园里应该做什么、不应该做什么，再就是遵循夸奖取代惩罚的原则，采用积极的方式激励孩子。”\n为提高实习质量，河北师范大学出台了《实习支教教学指导教师管理办法》，对实习支教采取“四位一体”教学指导模式，即高校专业教师指导、县域特聘名师指导、实习学校教师指导、驻县教师指导，构建由高校学科教学论教师及专业教师、省市县教学名师和一线教学骨干教师组成的专业教学指导团队。\n“每期我们会聘请100余名高校教师，400余名县域特聘名师，30余名驻县教师，让实习生在有效指导下，听课、备课、研课、磨课，让学生在参与中反思，在互动中成长。”顶岗支教指导中心主任张云晶介绍。\n通过竞赛机制激发学生潜能，也是培养师范生创新能力和实践技能的重要途径。在实习支教期间，河北师范大学还举办板书比赛、说课比赛、微讲课比赛，通过多种赛事，以赛促能，提升学生教学能力。\n在赛事打磨中，学生的教学实践能力不断提升。仅以河北师范大学学生参加“田家炳杯”全国师范生教学技能大赛为例，十年来，共荣获该项赛事一等奖10项、二等奖25项、三等奖22项。\n“赛事历练扩展了实习形式的多样性，以赛促学，以赛带练，以赛培优，加速了师范生的实践教学专业成长，增强了学科融合与校际交流。”张云晶表示。\n薪火相传\n职业目标更加明确\n“赵州桥为什么要设计成拱形？古人是如何精确计算和建造如此坚固的桥梁的？”……前不久，河北师范大学2022级教育学专业本科生、赵县石塔中学高一（2）班实习老师曹佳玉带着学生在赵州桥公园上了一堂“行走的数学课”。\n学生们拿着卷尺测量，用手机拍照记录，热烈地讨论着，尝试用课本上的知识去解释眼前的奇迹。\n这堂课被赵县石塔中学作为特色案例推广，也在学生心中种下文化自信与学科融合的种子。\n实习老师的课堂也能这么精彩，她是如何做到的？\n在实习支教期间，曹佳玉制定了一套详细的工作方案。上课前先在网上学习同课题优秀教学视频，再结合网课、教材和教参，独立撰写详细教案。只要有时间，她还去听指导老师或其他有经验老师的课。听完课后，曹佳玉对照自己的教案，再进行反思和修改。\n三个月时间，她手写了80多份教案、60余份听课记录。\n“几个月的实习让我的教学能力有了质的飞跃，也让我对因材施教、循序渐进、教学相长等教学方法的理解更加具体和深刻。”曹佳玉说。\n实习支教不仅锻炼了教学能力和班级管理水平，最主要的是学生通过半年全职教师的角色体验，对教师职业有了真实感受和深入理解，让他们成为“未来之师”的信念更加坚定，成为“四有好老师”的职业目标更加明确。\n林家伊是河北师范大学外国语学院2022级师范生，在石家庄市第二中学西校区实习，担任初一年级7班和8班的英语教师。\n实习这几个月，她感受最深的是对教师这个职业的认识发生转变：“以前是父母想让我当老师，现在是自己想当一名好老师。”\n是什么让她的观念发生了转变？\n“我居然被学生写进了作文里。”提起这件事，林家伊很是自豪。\n刚接手这个班时，林家伊对全班的同学说：“不管你们以前的成绩怎样，我不会放弃你们中的任何人。”\n没想到这句话深深地“钻”进了学生心里。那个英语成绩曾经在班里倒数的小姑娘开始发奋学习，成绩有了明显提升。\n“那一刻，我突然明白了教育的意义，也加深了对教师职业内涵的理解，坚定了自己的信念。我要当老师，成为那束能照亮别人的光。”林家伊说。\n为期半年的实习支教，让不少师范生像林家伊一样慢慢体会到教书育人的责任与担当，职业规划逐渐清晰。（河北日报记者 陈华）",

    "text": "Qi2 chargers are quite prevalent these days, and come in all kinds of shapes and sizes , so why not make one exclusively for Europeans with outlets above their kitchen countertops and a neat assortment of olive oils?\nZens may have figured out the key to a truly wire-free wireless charger with its new Wireless Charging Adapter . It’s a lot like most Qi2 / MagSafe chargers, capable of charging an iPhone at up to 15W, but it skips the usual wire between the outlet and magnetic pad to just plug directly into the wall.\nWhat, you don’t color-match your charger and outlet covers to your wall? And you call yourself civilized? Image: Zens The €49.99 charger seems a little limiting if you don’t have the ideal outlet placement (and like the tiniest bit of a drop risk if you’re all butterfingers), but it’s also limited in availability since it only comes with EU plugs — for the time being, at least. Zens may not be the first to make a charger like this, but a quick search only pulls up a couple examples from no-name brands that won’t charge as fast .\nThe Netherlands-based company doesn’t often shy away from making unique and single-purpose charging solutions, so it’s not terribly surprising to see it test the waters for such a quirky charger. And the Wireless Charging Adapter isn’t purely wireless, as it also offers a wired USB-C port to charge a second device — making it quite a different take on the typical 2-in-1 .\nThe black charger is available now from Zens, though a white version is coming November 7th.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
