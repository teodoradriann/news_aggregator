    "text": "The Felicidad T. Sy Foundation, Inc. (FTSFI) united 16 couples in holy matrimony during the &quot;8th Kasalan sa SM&quot; mass wedding held at the Shrine of Jesus the Way, the Truth and the Life Church in Pasay City. This special occasion included members of their 296,000-member Facebook community, the SM SuperMoms Club, making the day even more heartwarming. Felicidad T. Sy Foundation celebrates love and faith with &#039;8th Kasalan sa SM&#039; mass wedding The success of the event wouldn&#039;t have been possible without the generous contributions of Kultura&#039;s Barong Filipino and Berches Barong, who provided Barong Tagalogs for all the grooms. Goldilocks also played a key role by sponsoring the 16 wedding cakes, and Gandang Ricky Reyes ensured a memorable experience for the brides with their hair and makeup services. Their support made the day truly special for the couples and their families. The Kasalan sa SM initiative is an important part of FTSFI&#039;s religious projects, an affiliate of the SM Foundation. This program, established nearly a decade ago, reflects the dedication of SM Group matriarch Felicidad T. Sy, also known as &quot;Nanang,&quot; to promoting spiritual well-being within communities. Nanang&#039;s vision extends beyond weddings. She champions numerous religious activities, including the operation of masses and the restoration/upkeep of churches and shrines within and near SM Malls. These initiatives provide accessible places of worship for Catholic mall-goers and the communities SM serves. The 8th Kasalan sa SM mass wedding, officiated by clergy members, brought joy and blessings to the newlyweds who celebrated their union with loved ones. This event not only strengthens the bond of marriage but also underscores SM Group&#039;s commitment to upholding Filipino Catholic faith and fostering strong family values within the community.

    "text": "POCAHONTAS, Ark. (KAIT) - Public safety departments across the United States are honoring 911 dispatchers’ work during National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week. In Randolph County, E911 Coordinator Hampton Owens explained that 911 dispatchers guard the line between life and death with every phone call. “We dispatch for eight fire departments, an ambulance service, the local police department, and the Randolph County Sheriff’s Office,” Owens explained. Dispatchers send help to those in shootings, fires, accidents, or any other life-threatening situation. “We average anywhere between 20-25 911 calls a day, ranging from accidental dials to major catastrophes, wrecks, and fires,” Owens stated. Owens said being a 911 dispatcher is more than just the average nine-to-five. “It’s not something that you can just get up in the morning and say, ‘Hey I’m going to get up and go be a 911 dispatcher.’ It’s something that you have to love, you’ve got to be able to love your job, and you have to be called to do it,” Owens explained. As the dispatchers face immense pressure on an everyday basis. “It’s extremely stressful. You can go from having a good time, talking and visiting with one another, and then everything go haywire and crazy,” Owens stated. Sheriff Kevin Bell said without dispatchers, it’d be hard to get help to where it needs to go. “They’re vitally important to our role in law enforcement and public safety,” the sheriff stated. Owens added in recent years, hiring and retaining workers has been a struggle, but the job is one of the most rewarding you’ll find. To report a typo or correction, please click here .

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle.\nThe Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help.

McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

Esta situación provoca que quienes solamente tengan estudios de secundaria no puedan aspirar a mejores posiciones laborales, entre otras limitantes. “En Nuevo León la escolaridad promedio es de 10 años. Tenemos a 187 mil personas que no ha podido concluir la prepa, mucha gente ha dejado trunca la educación media superior”, explicó Lorena de la Garza, legisladora del PRI. La diputada indicó que cursar la prepa abona a mejorar la calidad de vida. “También a lograr trabajos mejor pagados. Por lo regular en Nuevo León quienes abandonan la escuela o terminan simplemente hasta la secundaria es por diversas razones, pero destacan que se ponen a trabajar para ayudar a la familia; también puede ser por la inseguridad”, destacó. De la Garza firmó un convenio con la Universidad Uk para ofrecer la opción a quienes tienen estudios truncos y puedan concluir con la preparatoria. “Son estudios 100% en línea y gratuitos. Las personas interesadas solamente pagarán 400 pesos por concepto de registro y para obtener el certificado”, añadió. La Universidad Uk tiene 10 años y posee certificado de validez expedido por el Instituto de Educación de Aguascalientes por lo que sus estudios tienen validez. Gonzalo Pulit, director general de la institución educativa, indicó que más de la mitad de la población adulta en el país no concluyó la educación media superior. “Pueden ser casi 50 millones de personas”, confirmó, “terminar la prepa tiene beneficios importantes como crecer académicamente y avanzar en la licenciatura y en la especialización”. Pulit señaló que la opción que brinda la Universidad Uk es para que jóvenes y adultos puedan acceder a mejores empleos y salarios. “Es buscar alternativas”, indicó. “Cada año 5 millones de jóvenes comienzan prepa y un tercio la abandona. Es importante ofrecer alternativas prácticas y accesibles para que puedan terminar los estudios. Estamos lanzando este programa que puede ser de interés”. Pulit indicó que la Universidad Uk tiene 10 años de experiencia en prepa, licenciaturas y maestrías. El director general confirmó que los estudios son gratuitos y con tecnología de vanguardia. “Es un programa de prepa acelerada, de solo dos años, 100% en línea. Cuenta con plataforma y tecnología de estudios de vanguardia”. La plataforma educativa incluye Inteligencia Artificial y clases en vivo. Pulit añadió que los estudiantes pueden tomar sus clases en una computadora y hasta en el celular. De la Garza indicó que se abrirá la posibilidad de que los futuros estudiantes puedan tomar clases en otras áreas como sus oficinas. “Que estudien en un lugar con clima, WiFi, con comodidades para que aprovechen mejor. Más adelante vamos ir dándoles más información sobre este tema”, destacó. La legisladora aclaró que no hay límite de edad y que se trata de una institución seria. “No es una beca patito. No es una institución, como muchas, que son de charlatanes”. Las personas interesadas en estudiar la prepa deberán presentar los siguientes requisitos: - INE. - Certificado de secundaria. - Acta de nacimiento.",

In an official post on X, \"Indian Navy warships deployed in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden are escorting both Indian and international merchant vessels there.\" The crew expressed gratitude by chanting \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\" and thanked the Indian Navy for its support in escorting both Indian and international merchant vessels. \"A merchant vessel's crew welcomed an Indian Navy warship there by shouting slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai and thanked the Indian Navy for its support,\" the post on X reads. Recently, the Indian Navy informed in a statement on Thursday that its naval warship, INS Kolkata, swiftly acted against Wednesday's maritime incident, and all the crew members were safely evacuated to Djibouti. As per the Navy, the Barbados Flagged Bulk Carrier MV True Confidence was reportedly hit by a drone or missile, approximately 55 nm south-west of Aden, on Wednesday, resulting in a fire onboard and critical injuries to some of the crew members, forcing the crew to abandon the ship. INS Kolkata, deployed for Maritime Security Operations, arrived at the scene of action at 1645 hours and rescued 21 crew members, including one Indian national, from the liferaft using its integral helicopter and boats. Critical medical aid was also provided to the injured crew by the ship's medical team. The rescued crew, including the critically injured personnel, were evacuated to Djibouti on March 6 by INS Kolkata. Earlier on Wednesday, INS Kolkata responded to another distress call from a Liberian-flagged container vessel, MSC Sky II, which was reportedly attacked by a drone or missile in the southeast of Aden. Additionally, based on the request of the master, the merchant vessel (MV) was escorted from the scene of the incident to the territorial waters of Djibouti by the Indian Navy ship. Last month, responding to the distress call from the Fishing Vessel, an Indian Naval ship deployed in the North Arabian Sea for maritime security operations, provided damage control assistance and undertook strengthening of the hull, rendering the boat safe for further transit. Medical aid was also extended to three injured crew members. The relentless and persistent efforts of the Indian Navy reaffirm its resolve towards the safety of all vessels and seafarers transiting in the region, the statement added.
