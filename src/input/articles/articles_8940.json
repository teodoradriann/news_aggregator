    "text": "((Automated translation by Reuters, please see disclaimer https://bit.ly/rtrsauto))\n(Health Rounds is published Tuesdays and Thursdays. Think your friend or colleague should know about us? Send them this newsletter. They can also subscribe here.) by Nancy Lapid\nHello Health Rounds readers! GLP-1 drugs are in the news again, and not for weight loss. It is possible that drugs in this class can slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease. We also cover a potentially important discovery in the field of asthma, which could lead to new treatments, as well as an investigation into the prevalence of mistreatment of many mothers during childbirth in hospitals Americans.\nDiabetes drug could slow progression of Parkinson’s disease\nA diabetes drug in the same class of drugs widely used to treat obesity appears to slow the progression of early stages of Parkinson’s disease in a mid-stage trial, but with a potentially unacceptable rate of gastrointestinal side effects.\nIn the French trial, 156 patients who had Parkinson’s disease for less than three years and were receiving stable doses of drugs to treat symptoms received either daily injections of Sanofi SASY.PA’s GLP-1 agonist lixisenatide or a placebo.\nAfter 12 months, the lixisenatide group had virtually no change in scores on a validated tool for assessing movement disorders in Parkinson’s disease, while the placebo group had a 3-point worsening of symptoms on a scale of 199 points, according to a report published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\nThe 3-point advantage in treated patients was still evident two months later, the researchers found. However, 46% of participants who received lixisenatide experienced nausea and 13% experienced vomiting.\n“The incidence of side effects may pose a barrier to wider use of lixisenatide in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease,” wrote Dr. David Standaert, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in an editorial published in the site at the same time as the study.\nOriginally sold under the brand name Adlyxin, Sanofi stopped selling the drug in the United States in early 2023.\nIf a three-point improvement is the most that can be achieved, the benefit of lixisenatide could be limited, particularly because of side effects, Standaert said.\nHowever, if the drug allows patients to remain stable while those who are not treated see their condition deteriorate by three points per year “over a period of 5 to 10 years or more, then it could be a truly transformative treatment,” said Standaert.\nAsthma attacks damage the lining of the airways\nAsthma attacks actually damage the airways, new findings show, and preventing this damage could be the subject of new treatments, researchers say.\nAlthough primarily considered an inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks tissues, causing inflammation and mucus production, asthma is also known to involve bronchoconstriction – the tightening of the smooth muscle that surrounds the airways. .\nBy studying human lung tissue and asthmatic mice, researchers at King’s College London discovered that muscle constriction compresses and destroys the epithelial cells that form the lining of the airways. This damage in turn promotes inflammation and mucus production often associated with an asthma attack, they explain in a report published Thursday in Science.\nResearchers found that the standard treatment for asthma – albuterol to open the airways and inhaled corticosteroids to control inflammation – does not prevent damage to the airway epithelium and the inflammation that occurs. results after an asthma attack.\nHowever, blocking the compression process and subsequent destruction of epithelial cells helped counteract the damage to the airways and significantly reduce the inflammatory response, they said.\n“These results not only establish that bronchoconstriction is a pro-inflammatory stimulus, but they also open the way to new avenues of research that could inhibit the vicious cycle of mechanical damage and inflammation,” wrote another team. of authors in a commentary published on the site at the same time as the study.\n1 in 8 American mothers report being abused during childbirth\nVarious forms of mistreatment during childbirth are common in U.S. hospitals, according to a study published Thursday in JAMA Network Open.\nResearchers surveyed a representative sample of approximately half a million people who gave birth to a child living in 2020 in New York City and the states of Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Utah and Virginia. Nearly 14% of the 4,458 study participants reported mistreatment during labor and delivery by responding to a validated questionnaire.\nThe most common forms of mistreatment reported were: being “ignored, denied a request for help, or not responding in a timely manner”, being “yelled at or scolded” by health care providers, and have healthcare providers threaten “to refuse treatment or force you to accept treatment that you did not want”.\nThis type of treatment was most commonly reported by women who were unmarried, insured by the Medicaid program for the poor, identified as LGBTQ, considered obese, with a history of substance use disorders, mental disorders, mood or domestic or intimate partner violence, as well as by women who have given birth by unplanned cesarean section.\n“Mistreatment during childbirth has been widely documented in low- and middle-income countries, but this study shows that respectful maternal care is an important quality metric that we should also follow in the United States,” said in a press release the leader of the study, Jamie Daw, of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, in New York.\nHer team only looked at abuse during childbirth. New mothers in the sample may also have experienced mistreatment during pregnancy or the postnatal period, the researchers said.\nSource link -86",

    "title": "Pittsburgh International to expand solar farm; eyes hydrogen hubRunway Girl",
    "text": "Known as one of the most sustainable and resilient airports in the world, Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) in western Pennsylvania is looking to double the size of its solar farm. PIT’s current 8-acre farm with 9,390 solar panels is part of a three-year-old hybrid microgrid that also features an on-site natural gas power plant. But with vast acreage at its disposal, the airport is about to expand with many more solar panels. “We’ve got plenty of land. We sit on 8,800 acres at PIT, so we’ve got a lot of space,” Christina Cassotis, CEO of PIT operator Allegheny County Airport Authority, told RGN on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association’s World Sustainability Symposium in Coral Gables, Florida. “It hasn’t been announced yet. It’s coming soon,” she revealed in reference to the solar farm expansion. Sitting atop the massive Marcellus Shale natural gas reserve, PIT is naturally advantaged — beyond the expansive nature of its property. By embracing a hybrid approach to its microgrid, inclusive of solar, the facility has been able to dramatically reduce carbon emissions and slash electricity costs in a region that is otherwise known for its coal-heavy grid. “When I got there, they had just signed the lease with [natural gas company] CNX. So, when I took over that, that deal was already done. CNX had secured permission to extract natural gas on the property. And I think about a year after I got there, we started to see the results of that because we … get a royalty for that,” explained Cassotis. “So, that has helped us with capital. It has helped us enormously to reinvest and that’s been really important for us. But we wanted to make sure that what we were doing is that we were investing not just financial resources, but investing these gas resources.” With a keen focus on improving resiliency and sustainability, a decision was taken early on to adopt a hybrid approach. “There was no way it was not going to be hybrid,” Cassotis said. “How do you send a message on sustainability and not have a renewable fuel source? So, to me it was non-negotiable; there was going to be a renewable resource for fuel that would power that microgrid in addition to the natural gas, because that’s the story we wanted to tell.” She continued: The story we’ve always wanted to tell is that it’s a pathway, it’s a series of steps; it’s not a leap into a cleaner, greener future. And so, what can we do to be more resilient? Number one, that was the first goal, but we weren’t going to do it at the expense of finance or the expense of the environment. So, once we realized we could attain resiliency and lower our carbon footprint and lower our energy costs, which of course directly impacts the airlines’ bottom line, then it was a no brainer. And so why? So, let’s tell the whole story. The whole story is that airports can do more to be sustainable. And we had the land for solar, so it just made a whole lot of sense. Nobody’s putting wind turbines up in an airport. The project is attracting interest from airlines and other airports alike. “We are getting visits from folks to tour the microgrid… Southwest Airlines actually came up and said, ‘we want to understand this so we can talk to some of our other airport partners about it,'” she said. “We had the city of Houston come in to look at it for the airport in Houston and we have a group coming over from Japan actually. It’s fascinating. And we’ve had other airports ask us about it and we just published a white paper. We’re getting interest but we haven’t seen anybody else do a microgrid yet.” Though PIT is presently in the midst of a major transformation — one that aims to enhance the passenger experience for all travelers, including those with mobility challenges — it is innovating in other eco-focused ways as the wider aviation industry works to achieve Net Zero by 2050. To that end, PIT in May announced it is working with CNX and KeyState Energy to accelerate regional and national hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) developments, including with a proposed facility that would help catalyze hydrogen and SAF at scale — with the anticipation that hydrogen-powered aircraft (and indeed other use cases for hydrogen) are forthcoming, and in acknowledgment of the massive role that SAF will play in helping industry meet its sustainability targets. “We actually worked with a DOE-patented scientist in Pittsburgh to test how to create distributed hydrogen in a cost effective manner,” Cassotis told RGN in Florida. “We actually did a one-year study with him and we’re looking for the funding. We’ve talked to everybody from DOE to some of the airlines’ venture funds about building the prototype, which would be about the size of the back of an 18-wheeler as opposed to a huge hydrogen hub. “But how do you create distributed hydrogen in a cost effective manner? Yeah, we see ourselves as a hydrogen hub in ourselves. We have use cases for it, not just us, but our partners do , and we want to be at the forefront of that as well.” The Allegheny County Airport Authority chief and fellow staffers attended the IATA World Sustainability Symposium as they’re on the lookout for who in the ecosystem is making moves. “Who’s thinking differently than we are? How do we learn? What else are we missing? How can we connect with folks who have the same ideas that we do or the same sort of value system around ‘let’s make this better’. I feel strongly that as an industry globally, we need to earn our right to grow,” she said. “And I am an aviation aficionado. My dad was a Pan Am pilot. I care about this industry and I don’t want it hammered with the misperception that we’re not doing anything.” Related Articles: PIT is on the march with new airlines, routes and tech hub buzz ZeroAvia CEO Val Miftakhov reveals plan for possible IPO in 2026 JFK joins growing list of airports turning to the sun to cut emissions Sustainability and savings drive Pittsburgh Airport microgrid How Kempegowda International is harvesting sunlight and rainwater Pittsburgh International Airport’s recovery fueled by girl power Featured image credited to istock.com/bgwalker",

    "title": "El efecto psicológico de vivir en ciudades contaminadas: ¿cuál es?",
    "text": "La contaminación del aire no solo afecta nuestros pulmones, también impacta de forma silenciosa y profunda nuestra mente. En un mundo donde más del 55% de la población vive en áreas urbanas, entender las consecuencias de vivir en ciudades contaminadas es más urgente que nunca. No se trata solo de enfermedades respiratorias o cardiovasculares, sino de impactos emocionales, cognitivos y sociales que alteran la calidad de vida.\nDiversos estudios científicos han demostrado que la exposición continua a altos niveles de polución puede detonar síntomas de ansiedad, depresión e incluso deterioro cognitivo. Esta relación entre contaminación y salud mental ha empezado a ser reconocida por organismos internacionales como la OMS y la ONU, especialmente en contextos de desigualdad social. Vivir en ciudades contaminadas no es solo una cuestión ambiental, también es una crisis silenciosa de salud pública.\n¿Qué sucede en el cerebro al vivir en ciudades contaminadas? Cuando una persona está expuesta diariamente a aire contaminado, su sistema nervioso central comienza a reaccionar. Las partículas finas en el aire pueden atravesar la barrera hematoencefálica, llegando directamente al cerebro y desencadenando procesos inflamatorios. Esto se ha asociado con mayor riesgo de enfermedades neurodegenerativas como el Alzheimer y el Parkinson.\nAdemás, la exposición crónica al dióxido de nitrógeno y al material particulado se relaciona con cambios estructurales en regiones cerebrales como el hipocampo, clave para la memoria y el aprendizaje. Esto puede tener efectos particularmente graves en niños, niñas y adolescentes, cuyo cerebro aún está en desarrollo.\nLa neurociencia urbana está empezando a demostrar que vivir en ciudades contaminadas puede modificar la forma en que pensamos, sentimos y actuamos. El estrés urbano se ve amplificado por la polución, y esto impacta directamente en nuestra salud mental y bienestar emocional.\nSalud mental urbana: la otra cara de la contaminación Más allá de lo biológico, vivir en ciudades contaminadas también genera una constante sensación de malestar. El aire denso, la falta de visibilidad y los olores desagradables generan una carga psicológica persistente. Esto incrementa los niveles de estrés crónico, afecta la calidad del sueño y debilita el sistema inmunológico.\nEn barrios con mayores niveles de contaminación se ha documentado un aumento en diagnósticos de depresión, ansiedad y trastornos de ánimo. Esto no es coincidencia: la relación entre el entorno físico y el bienestar mental es cada vez más evidente. Lugares sucios y descuidados también influyen en nuestra percepción del valor que tiene nuestra vida y comunidad.\nVivir en ciudades contaminadas es, muchas veces, vivir en un entorno hostil para la mente. Cuando el ambiente externo no permite respirar con tranquilidad, el equilibrio interno también se ve alterado. Esta es una alerta importante para quienes diseñan políticas públicas y espacios urbanos.\nImpactos sociales: desigualdad ambiental y emocional No todas las personas sufren los efectos de la contaminación de la misma manera. Quienes viven en zonas marginadas suelen estar más expuestos a fuentes de polución, como fábricas, tráfico intenso o basureros a cielo abierto. La desigualdad ambiental se traduce también en una desigualdad emocional.\nLas personas que viven en ciudades contaminadas y en contextos de pobreza suelen tener menos acceso a servicios de salud mental, espacios verdes o infraestructura adecuada para cuidar su bienestar. La falta de oportunidades para salir de estos entornos agudiza la sensación de encierro, frustración y desesperanza.\nPor eso, hablar de salud mental en zonas urbanas también implica hablar de justicia social. La responsabilidad social empresarial y gubernamental debe incluir acciones que reduzcan la exposición a contaminantes y fomenten la resiliencia emocional en las comunidades más vulnerables.\n¿Qué podemos hacer ante este panorama? La buena noticia es que no todo está perdido. Muchas ciudades han comenzado a tomar medidas para reducir la contaminación y mitigar sus efectos sobre la salud mental. Desde promover el uso de transporte no motorizado, hasta aumentar los espacios verdes y la arborización urbana. Estas acciones pueden marcar una gran diferencia.\nLa conciencia ciudadana también juega un papel fundamental. Informarnos sobre los riesgos de vivir en ciudades contaminadas y exigir cambios estructurales en las políticas urbanas y ambientales es un acto de responsabilidad individual y colectiva. La salud mental debe ser parte integral de cualquier estrategia sostenible.\nAdemás, desde la perspectiva de la responsabilidad social, las empresas pueden contribuir implementando políticas internas que promuevan entornos laborales saludables, reducción de emisiones y programas comunitarios de salud emocional. El bienestar urbano es una tarea compartida.\nVivir en ciudades contaminadas es mucho más que una molestia física; es una experiencia que afecta el cerebro, las emociones y la convivencia social. Su impacto en la salud mental requiere atención urgente desde el ámbito de la salud pública, la política ambiental y la responsabilidad social empresarial.\nSi queremos construir ciudades más humanas, debemos reconocer el vínculo entre aire limpio y mente sana. Apostar por entornos urbanos sostenibles no es solo una cuestión de ecología, sino de salud mental colectiva. Porque respirar aire limpio es, también, un derecho emocional.",

    "text": "Está suscitando cierto revuelo la iniciativa de una asociación integrada por juristas, entre ellos jueces y magistrados, de elaborar unos modelos de auto suscitando una cuestión de constitucionalidad ante el Tribunal Constitucional o una cuestión prejudicial ante el Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea sobre la Ley de Amnistía. La iniciativa se justifica por sus promotores desde la premisa tajante de que se trata –o se tratará, si se aprueba– de una ley que vulnera la Constitución y los Tratados de la UE. No voy a entrar en el (interesante y enormemente controvertido) fondo de la cuestión. No pretendo añadir más argumentos a favor de alguna de las tesis que se enfrentan. Lo que sí pretendo es poner de manifiesto el peligro de convertir la cuestión de constitucionalidad (o la cuestión prejudicial) en un instrumento “corporativo” del Poder Judicial, es decir, de trastocar su auténtica e insustituible naturaleza jurisdiccional y hacer de ellas un sustituto de un recurso de inconstitucionalidad (o un recurso por incumplimiento) interpuesto “por los jueces”. O por un conjunto de ellos.\nLos promotores de esta iniciativa saben que cada juez, cada tribunal, decidirá por sí mismo. Pero el resultado puede acabar siendo un deterioro más de los instrumentos del Estado de derecho, al estandardizar y colectivizar una decisión que sólo puede ser individual, y llevarlo al terreno doctrinal (o incluso político), abstracto, en el que el juez sólo pusiera, por militancia o por pereza, su adhesión a un “movimiento”.\nExisten guías y recursos para facilitar a un juez la tarea de formular “cualquier” cuestión de constitucionalidad o una cuestión prejudicial. Es algo inobjetable: son trámites de alguna complejidad que sólo ocasionalmente en la vida de un juez se presentan, y es normal elaborar guías procedimentales.\nLo que es insólito es que se distribuyan masivamente a través del correo corporativo del poder judicial guías, instrucciones o recomendaciones para actuaciones posibles sobre un asunto determinado y concreto, incluyendo argumentación jurídica.\nLa cuestión de inconstitucionalidad no es un recurso de inconstitucionalidad. La cuestión prejudicial no es un recurso por incumplimiento. Los jueces no están facultados, como tales, para interponer esos procedimientos, defendiendo una posición concreta. Respecto del recurso de inconstitucionalidad, pueden interponerlo un grupo de 50 diputados o senadores, o el Gobierno, o el Defensor del Pueblo, y en algunos casos las Comunidades Autónomas. No el Consejo General del Poder Judicial, ni 50 jueces.\n¿Para qué, y por qué, entonces, la cuestión de inconstitucionalidad, o la cuestión prejudicial?\nLa cuestión de inconstitucionalidad es un instrumento importantísimo que abunda en la protección de la Constitución frente al legislador, y que la estira más allá de círculo de legitimados para la interposición del recurso de inconstitucionalidad. Su ámbito y alcance se ciñen al caso de que un juez o tribunal, que deba aplicar una ley determinada de manera decisoria en el caso concreto que juzga, tenga dudas sobre su ajuste a la Constitución, cuando sobre tal cuestión no se ha planteado un recurso de inconstitucionalidad, o, planteado, no se haya resuelto aún por sentencia. En vez de no aplicarla, ha de preguntar al Tribunal Constitucional, porque el ordenamiento jurídico presume la constitucionalidad de las leyes aprobadas después de la Constitución, y esa presunción dura hasta que el Tribunal Constitucional establece lo contrario.\nEs obvio que para llegar a formarse un criterio sobre la posibilidad de que una ley que debe aplicar vulnere la Constitución o el Derecho de la UE, el juez habrá leído opiniones publicadas, habrá escuchado debates en radio o televisión, y habrá hablado con compañeros. Nada tiene eso de particular: los jueces, por fortuna, no viven ensimismados. Pero la decisión de preguntar al TC o al TJUE ha de ser el resultado de una decisión personal. No sólo eso: la justificación o motivación escrita de esa decisión ha de ser , también, tan individual como lo es la de una sentencia sobre un caso concreto: de ninguna manera cabe una motivación por remisión, ni estándar, ni copiada de la sugerencia de un tercero que no es quien está juzgando el caso. Menos aún si esos modelos sugeridos se elaboran antes de que el juez haya oído a las partes en el procedimiento sobre el asunto, trámite éste obligado como presupuesto para suscitar la cuestión de inconstitucionalidad, precisamente porque se pretende que la cuestión de inconstitucionalidad no resulte de un planteamiento ideológico o teórico-jurídico del juez formado en debates doctrinales, tertulias u opiniones publicadas, sino que brote de la necesidad del juicio concreto, del caso concreto: la finalidad, para un juez, de suscitar la cuestión no es “conseguir” que se declare insconstitucional una ley y expulsarla del ordenamiento jurídico, sino aplicar la norma correcta para el caso, y para eso tiene primero que oír a las partes interesadas, y, sólo después, preguntar al TC (o al TJUE) si persisten o se acrecientan sus dudas tras los argumentos de las partes, que han de ser atentamente considerados.\nSugerir una estructura y contenido concreto para que un juez la adopte no es un ataque a la independencia judicial, porque el juez no se va a ver presionado para tomar una decisión que no quiera, ni para argumentar de manera diferente a como piensa. El problema, el problema serio, no es propiamente de intromisión en la labor del juez, sino la desnaturalización de la cuestión suscitada que puede provocar si la iniciativa tiene éxito. Si un juez “sigue el modelo”, bien puede apreciarse que la resolución la ha dictado un tercero, y allá sus responsabilidades. Si muchos jueces siguen el modelo, la cuestión llegará al TC o al TJUE como un posicionamiento colectivo de un “conjunto de jueces”, cuando no como un movimiento corporativo.\nEs como si, en un asunto difícil, el juez encarga a un catedrático de confianza, o a una Asociación Judicial, que le hagan un borrador de sentencia. Así sería, en este caso, si el juez o el tribunal de un caso en que sea de aplicación la Ley de Amnistía, hace uso de la controvertida Guía y reproduce sus argumentos. Da igual que suscriba personalmente punto por punto su contenido: sería una motivación elaborada desde fuera, por un comité, un seminario o un sindicato. Una decisión externalizada. Por eso la mejor noticia sería que la iniciativa fuese ignorada por los jueces. Es decir, que cada juez hiciera su propio esfuerzo para dilucidar, tras oír a las partes, si suscita o no la cuestión, y en qué términos, sin utilizar el argumentario de la Guía.\nEn resumen, entiendo que la asociación promotora de la Guía habría debido limitarse a emitir un informe en el que legítimamente expresase su convicción sobre la inconstitucionalidad y no conformidad con los Tratados Europeos de la Ley de Amnistía. Pero embutir sus planteamientos en forma de borrador de auto judicial y remitirlo, a través del correo corporativo, a todos los jueces de España, ofreciéndolo para que lo utilicen si conocen de algún asunto concreto en que resulte de aplicación la Ley de Amnistía, me parece un error grave y bien significativo de que, respecto de algunas cuestiones, la voluntad de conseguir un objetivo importa más que el cuidado de las instituciones. Aunque se haga con la buena intención de “salvar” las instituciones.",
