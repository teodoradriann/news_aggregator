    "text": "Above photo: Jacques Beech saw his electric bill fall to $100 a month after installing solar panels on his Minneapolis home. Brad Stauffer / Energy News Network.\nSolstar is a retired solar entrepreneur’s effort to bring solar and jobs to a community where he rarely worked during his three-decade career in the industry.\nOne installation at a time, a solar nonprofit that matches socially conscious investors’ cash with lower-income homeowners is spreading the benefits of solar in North Minneapolis.\nSolstar was\nformed three years ago by solar entrepreneur Ralph Jacobson following his retirement from IPS Solar, the pioneering Twin Cities’ solar company he founded three decades ago earlier.\nIn his entire career, “I hardly ever had Black customers or Black subcontractors,” Jacobson recalled.\nSolstar is a collective effort for clean energy leaders in North Minneapolis to address those racial disparities.\nJacobson, 71, works his network to persuade wealthy individuals to invest in residential solar installations. Kristel Porter, a well-known community activist, recruits low- or moderate-income homeowners who are interested in having solar on their homes. J.T. Thomas of the Black-owned Go Solar Construction trains and supervises students who help install the projects.\nSolstar takes care of applications for all of the available incentives. Homeowners pay nothing and immediately benefit from a lower monthly electricity bill.\n“It’s a no-brainer,” said Jacques Beech, who signed up with Solstar and now has solar panels on the roof of the 2,700-square-foot ranch home he shares with his wife and two kids.\nHis electricity bill so far has dropped by around $100 a month.\n‘It Has Been Harder Than Expected’\nThe model is working, though slower than Solstar’s founders would have hoped. The nonprofit initially wanted to finish 24 projects in its first two years. Instead, it’s completed ten and expects to hit the two dozen mark later this year.\n“We found it has been harder than expected and needed a different skill set,” Jacobson said.\nAmong the challenges were managing investors, timing projects around incentives, convincing skeptical homeowners the offer wasn’t too good to be true, and keeping trainees employed in the still sporadic industry.\nSolstar’s financing is complex. The nonprofit pays for installations by attracting investors and offering them a modest rate of return. Three major equity investors take advantage of the tax credits and depreciation on the projects. Solstar’s microlenders do not get tax credits but instead receive 3.5% on investments ranging from $5,000 to $50,000.\nSolstar investors reduce their taxes by taking advantage of the 30% tax credit and a six-year depreciation schedule on solar projects. After exhausting tax incentives, Solstar plans to sell the solar systems to their commercial and residential customers at a significantly reduced price. Clients hosting Solstar panels on their roofs receive discounts on their electricity by as much as 20% and, in some cases, more.\nJacobson reduces his costs by taking advantage of other programs. Every project is sized up to 120% of the client’s electricity use, the highest amount allowed under Xcel Energy’s Solar Rewards incentive program. Solar Rewards pays more per kilowatt hour for participating low-income households. A production incentive from the city of Minneapolis’s Green Zone program adds another layer of support.\nNone of this is easily absorbed by investors or clients. Jacobson quickly discovered interested investors, but many would require multiple conversations and several weeks of consideration before betting on his new program.\nEventually, crowdsourcing cash paid off. “I certainly developed a bit of a following, a little community of maybe 70 to 75 people, who have put money into these projects,” he said.\nOne of those is Eric Pasi, a former partner at IPS Solar who now runs the community solar company Enterprise Energy. He saw an opportunity to move solar beyond helping reduce energy bills of middle- and upper-class clients to a BIPOC mixed-income neighborhood.\n“We love projects like this because for a modest investment the impact for these projects is so great,” said Pasi, who is also a board member of Fresh Energy, which publishes the Energy News Network.\nJob-Training Challenges\nAfter Solstar began knocking on doors of North Minneapolis residents in early 2021, Jacobson discovered the annual budget for Xcel’s Solar Rewards program had already run out of money for the year. Porter kept marketing Solstar and speaking to potential clients to prepare installations for 2022 and 2023.\nThe Solar Rewards issue was just the start of problems. “I didn’t realize we were going to run into as many potholes as we ended up running into,” Porter said.\nSome homeowners sat on the fence, not making a final decision for months. At least four who signed up in 2023 delayed solar projections because they needed new roofs after an August hail storm.\nTrying to pay professional contractors and their trainees became expensive and “tricky and financially just too much,” Porter said.\nSolstar eventually broadened the contractor pool beyond Go Solar to finish projects within the Solar Rewards deadlines. If a project does not meet deadlines, Solstar would have to reapply for Solar Rewards the following year “and go through the whole process again,” Porter said.\nOther projects were slowed when Xcel laid off several employees who were familiar with Solstar and its model.\nSolstar’s job training pipeline has also run into hurdles. Thomas onboards students from training programs offered by the city of Minneapolis and partnering institutions such as the Regional Apprenticeship Training Center. Four students who received classroom training then worked with Thomas on Solstar projects.\nSome students struggle with getting transportation to installation jobs, he said. Training is often scheduled so far in advance that job opportunities may not be immediately available when students finish their classes.\nMany students can’t spend a month or two waiting for a job, Thomas said, and when a job emerges, they may not be available because they are already working.\n“It’s taken a while to ramp up, but now it seems like the jobs are trickling in and we’re getting the processes down,” he said. “Hopefully, as we go on to it next year, it will be a little more seamless.”\nReplicating The Model\nStill, according to attorney Jeremy Kalin, the program’s approach and hard-won success means that other nonprofits could use the same approach. His firm, Avisen, has worked with similar programs in Maryland and others are starting in Arizona, Georgia and New Mexico.\nThe difference between Solstar and those initiatives is that Jacobson recruited wealthy investors who could take advantage of the tax credits and depreciation. Nonprofits in other states will use the Inflation Reduction Act’s “direct pay” option rather than rely on investors. The act allows nonprofits and government agencies to receive tax credits as cashback from the IRS.\nNonprofits using direct pay did not have a way to “monetize the depreciation deduction,” but “they have a simpler task because finding tax credit investors with the right kind of taxable income is hard,” Kalin said.\nJacobson has not determined whether Solstar will continue the same structure or lean into direct pay. He said several early investors in Solstar and a\nseparate initiative he helps lead in the Red Lake Indian community want to continue participating in Solstar.\nEarly customers like the program. Beech said he would have never made such a significant investment with such a long payback without the program. “It’s not a cost-effective thing, unless you just have the money, which I don’t,” Beech said. “This is an affordable way to do it.”\nAfter completing the first iteration of Solstar, Jacobson wants to start another limited liability company and start recruiting 24 more homes and small businesses. “If White people can build wealth by owning solar, then I guess Black people should be able to build wealth by owning solar, too,” he said.\nThis\narticle was originally published by Energy News Network.",

    "text": "VIGO COUNTY, Ind. (WTHI) - At the Terre Haute Convention Center, tourism officials are celebrating a record-breaking year for tourism revenue in Terre Haute. On Thursday, the Terre Haute Convention and Visitors Bureau hosted a \"Tourism update event.\" In 2022, visitors spent $283 million annually. In 2023, revenue topped that number by 14.8%. Mayor Brandon Sakbun says the city's tourism revenue for 2024, is already ahead of last year by 18 percent, with still three months to go. Another success the event highlighted was Hulman Links being recognized as the best golf course in the state of Indiana. As well as the city being named a premier college town. The mayor says these accomplishments create a lot of potential to keep moving forward. \"You need to keep adding to your deck, adding to your portfolio, cause if not, another community is, right? Sakbun said. \"So we have got to evaluate these opportunities, as well as recognize the performances we got.\" The addition of the new downtown hotel will be Terre Haute's biggest feature in tourism in the near future. There will be dining, drinking, and pedestrian sky bridges connecting to the convention center, that will come with the new hotel. \"This helps in some of those winter months when it is a little bit cold, bringing more conventions and trade shows to the community,\" Sakbun said. \"Where we really need to get to is leveraging a Hulman center, a convention center, and a downtown, instead of just a downtown and a convention center.\" Chris Switzer, the Vigo County commissioner says there are more upcoming projects being tossed around. Some of them he couldn't tell me. One of those is a renovation of the Indiana theatre. He says that could be a $15 to $30 million project, depending on how they go about improving it. Another potential project that he says continues to come up in conversations is a sports park east of Terre Haute. The sports park would be an indoor-outdoor athletic complex. He says that the project can't move forward without proper funding. \"We were certainly a little underwhelmed with the ready funds that we received in this region,\" Switzer said. \"That would be a big part of spurring that project immediately.\" The mayor also says the city is looking at the demolition of the downtown former police station. The mayor says a multi-use facility will replace it, with commercial and retail opportunities on the 1st floor, and residential opportunities on the 2nd, third, and fourth floor. The mayor says tourism features in Indianapolis have been a big inspiration. \"Indianapolis is one of the premier convention destinations in the United States of America,\" Sakbun said. \"While we don't have that downtown capability just due to our size, you take a scaled-down approach and model it off of that.\" The mayor says the next steps will be to start demolition of the old Vigo County School Corporation building for the new downtown hotel. That will start this fall.",

O diretor de futebol Guilherme Falcão tratou a interrupção do trabalho do argentino como um \"entendimento\" geral por parte do clube e antecipou que o desejo da diretoria é trazer, dessa vez, um substituto brasileiro para dirigir a equipe na sequência da temporada.\nSegundo apuração da reportagem do ge , o nome de Daniel Paulista, atualmente no CRB, e com passagens pela Ilha do Retiro como jogador e técnico, figura como opção forte nos bastidores .

Nós estamos aí em um estágio de temporada que não há espaço disponível para período de adaptação, de modo que esse treinador precisa conhecer a realidade do Sport, da Série B, do nosso elenco, para encurtar o mínimo esse período de transição e implementação de modelo de jogo\", acrescentou Falcão.\nSport decide demitir técnico Mariano Soso\nEmbora corra contra o tempo para anunciar com a maior celeridade possível um novo comandante, o Sport entende como difícil sacramentar qualquer operação até o jogo de sábado, contra a Ponte Preta, na Arena de Pernambuco.\nPor isso, a tendência é de que o auxiliar César Lucena esteja mais uma vez (esteve no empate contra a Chapecoense, na última rodada) à beira da área técnica da equipe no fim de semana.\nNa tabela de classificação da Série B, o Leão figura em sétimo lugar, com 25 pontos, a dois de distância do Novorizontino, atual quarto colocado.\n🎙️ Ouça o podcast Embolada 🎧\nAssista: tudo sobre o Sport no ge, na Globo e no sportv\n50 vídeos",

    "text": "(The Center Square) – Burien Police Chief Ted Boe is resigning from his position and transitioning to become the police chief for the neighboring city of Des Moines as Burien’s relationship with its police provider remains distant.\nBurien is in the midst of a\nlegal battle with the King County Sheriff’s Office regarding Ordinance 827, which effectively bans homeless people from living on any public property at any time. The city added an amendment that creates a 500-foot buffer zone around parks, libraries, schools, daycares, senior centers and makes it illegal for people to sleep overnight in those areas.\nIn response, King County Sheriff Patti Cole-Tindall said that the city’s ordinance violates federal case law and that her office will not enforce the public camping portion of the ordinance because it believes it violates constitutional rights of residents.\nBurien contracts with the King County Sheriff’s Office for its own dedicated and shared personnel as part of an interlocal agreement between the two entities. The city’s\n2024 adopted budget includes $16.7 million as part of a police contract with King County.\nPrior to his resignation, Boe served as the Burien chief of police since 2018. Prior to that, he served 18 years in the King County Sheriff’s Office, as sergeant, precinct operations captain, and major investigations section captain in Seattle, Burien, and SeaTac.\n“The Des Moines Police Guild supports Interim City Manager Tim George's decision to select Chief Boe as our next Police Chief,” Des Moines Police Guild President Justin Cripe said in a\nstatement. “Chief Boe and his exceptional leadership skills, extensive experience, and forward-thinking vision make him the ideal candidate for this critical role.”\nLast month, Burien City Manager Adolfo Bailon wrote a letter stating that he no longer trusted Boe to fulfill the requirements listed within the interlocal agreement between the two entities.\nBoe is now anticipated to start his new position in mid-August. Acting Police Chief Mark Couey will continue to lead the Des Moines Police Department until then.",

    "title": "China Orders Its Tech Companies To Boycott Nvidia - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Your enterprise IT team just got a new headache. Those Nvidia H20 chips you’ve been evaluating for your AI projects? Chinese regulators now claim they’re packed with backdoors and security vulnerabilities—turning routine procurement decisions into geopolitical chess moves reminiscent of other tech scandals . The controversy erupted when China’s Cyberspace Administration summoned Nvidia officials in July , demanding explanations about alleged “remote shutdown” capabilities in the H20 chip line. State media outlets, led by the influential Yuyuan Tantian account, launched a coordinated campaign urging Chinese companies to boycott the chips entirely. Even the People’s Daily joined the chorus, demanding Nvidia provide “convincing evidence” that their hardware isn’t compromised. Chinese officials have made serious accusations, but the evidence remains conspicuously absent. State media launched a coordinated offensive across Chinese publications, making several key claims: The performance context matters here. The H20 delivers only 15% of Nvidia’s flagship H100 capability due to U.S. export restrictions—hardly the cutting-edge threat Beijing portrays. Several Chinese tech companies have already announced reduced H20 orders, pivoting toward domestic alternatives like Huawei’s offerings amid broader AI training controversies . Nvidia’s response has been categorical: “There are no backdoors in the H20,” company representatives stated, emphasizing the chip wasn’t designed for military or government infrastructure. The company stressed its compliance with both U.S. and Chinese regulatory requirements. Industry analysts suggest this resembles previous tech boycott playbooks more than legitimate security discoveries. “Despite performance restrictions, the H20 remains a world-class product relative to Chinese competitors,” one semiconductor expert noted, highlighting the political timing of these allegations. The H20’s troubled journey reflects broader U.S.-China decoupling . Originally banned by the Trump administration in April 2025 , export restrictions were lifted just three months later as part of ongoing trade negotiations—only for Chinese authorities to now question the very chips they previously sought. For enterprise buyers, this creates an impossible calculus: The real question isn’t whether these chips contain backdoors—it’s whether tech procurement decisions will ever again be purely technical in our fractured digital world.",
