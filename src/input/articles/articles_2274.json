    "title": "Tale Of Two Fishers And 8-year Agreement | Mirage News",
    "text": "This is a tale of two fishers - commercial fisher Rick Burch and recreational fisher Wayne Bicknell - who together have helped \"calm the farm\" out on the Hawke's Bay waters. While from different fishing worlds, Wayne Bicknell and Rick Burch have been friends since Rick emigrated to New Zealand from the United Kingdom in the 1980s. They share a love for the sea - whether it's fishing, surfing or looking at ways to preserve it. As a reccie and a commercial guy, the two have had many a heated discussion around the dinner table over the years (which apparently p...es everyone off) but their friendship has helped to make a voluntary agreement between commercial and recreational sectors in Hawke's Bay a success. Largely because Rick is the go-to locally for commercial fishers and Wayne is one of the go-to's for recreational fishers. The agreement, which has now been in place for eight years, has transformed the once very tense relationship between commercial and recreational fishing sectors in the region. Entirely voluntary, the agreement between the Napier Fisherman's Association, Seafood New Zealand's Area 2 Committee and LegaSea Hawke's Bay, sees commercial fishers pause fishing in an area off the coast of Hawke's Bay (called the Springs Box) from the start of December through to the end of February. So, how did this come to be? Rick says the initial agreement came out of meetings organised by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) to \"help calm the farm\" following a series of incidents between commercial and recreational fishers. The meetings were attended by LegaSea Hawke's Bay (a sub-branch of LegaSea and outreach arm of the New Zealand Sports Fishing Council), 15 fishers, Seafood New Zealand Inshore Council (formerly Fisheries Inshore New Zealand), Te Ohu Kaimoana, as well as a number of local seafood companies. \"There were around 22 people all up. At the start, it was a bit fiery. It took about six months for things to settle,\" says Rick. \"From there, we started working on picking the low hanging fruit first. Things we agreed on.\" One of the things both sides agreed upon, was the evidence they had seen with their own eyes that snapper and gurnard spawn out in the Springs Box area in December and January. \"And so that's when we agreed we needed to do something to protect that area while it's spawning\" says Wayne. \"So, we started to get this voluntary arrangement going, drawing up the box area together.\" This voluntary arrangement has become so widely accepted by all parties that little negotiation is needed when the agreement is revisited each year. Rick says one of the biggest positives that's emerged is more respect for commercial fishers. \"The agreement has really helped improve the relationship we (commercial fishers) have with not just LegaSea Hawke's Bay, but with the wider public.\" At Seafood New Zealand, we see this arrangement, and the good things that flow from it, as another example of where collaboration has made us stronger. We recognise that for some commercial fishers in other parts of Aotearoa, negativity from some NGOs has been hurtful and damaging, both to the well-being of fishers and to their livelihoods. However, we thought it was important to share this excellent and too-rare example of the compromise and collaboration possible between the groups that share the oceans. It would be great to see more. Meanwhile for Rick and Wayne, while arguments still do happen from time-to-time, both agree that the Bay has got to be looked after, and it makes the best sense to be doing it together. They hope the agreement will continue for many years to come. [here](/tale-of-two-fishers-and-8-year-agreement-1218075/).",

    "text": "Video Video: For Adam Lambert and Auli’i Cravalho, Cabaret Is an Opportunity to Redefine Themselves\nThe production’s new Emcee and Sally Bowles dish on how they’re entering a new era with their Broadway debuts.\nThe Cabaret Broadway revival welcomed two new stars this week: Adam Lambert and Auliʻi Cravalho, who are both making their Broadway debuts in the roles of the Emcee and Sally Bowles, respectively. Learn about their interpretation of these beloved characters in the video interview above with Playbill’s Jeffrey Vizcaíno.\nFor the Grammy-nominated Lambert, who’s been primarily known as a recording artist and frontman to Queen, Cabaret is an opportunity to establish himself as more than a musician. “I’m excited to get back to theatre,” said Lambert. “This was the trajectory I was on. My childhood dream was to do Broadway. I think the closest thing I came to it was rehearsing for the first national [tour] of Wicked here in New York, 42nd Street Studios. But that was almost 20 years ago, so I took the fork in the road, and [I’ve] been doing the pop music thing, which I will still continue to do. But this is, like, a childhood dream. I love it, and I’ve always loved this show.”\nAs for real-life Disney princess Cravalho, she admits she’s nervous. But Cabaret is a welcomed departure from Moana, the Disney character that made her famous. “It’s also such a joy to be playing a character like [Sally], especially juxtaposed— Moana 2 comes out on November 27th. I am so grateful to be playing a role that challenges me in this way, that is an adult woman. I have been fighting for my life to get out of high school roles in TV and film. So I’m stoked to be playing [this] character.”\nMusical theatre, music, and Moana fans will have a long while to see these two stars—they’ll be at the Kit Kat Club through March 30, 2025. Below, see a new video montage from the show.\nLambert and Cravalho succeeded Eddie Redmayne and Gayle Rankin, respectively, in the show.\nCurrently on Broadway as a transfer from an Olivier-winning West End engagement, the revival of John Kander and Fred Ebb’s Cabaret opened April 21. Rebecca Frecknall directs. The production was nominated for nine 2024 Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical. It won one, for Tom Scutt’s set design.\nREAD: In Cabaret, Set and Costume Designer Tom Scutt Wanted to Celebrate Queer Individuality\nThe current cast of Cabaret also features Calvin Leon Smith, who\nsucceeded Ato Blankson-Wood as Clifford Bradshaw; and Michelle Aravena,\nsucceeding Natascia Diaz as Fraulein Kost and Fritzie, plus Bebe Neuwirth as Fraulein Schneider, Steven Skybell as Herr\nSchultz, and Henry Gottfried as Ernst Ludwig. Rebecca Frecknall directs.\nBased on Christopher Isherwood’s Goodbye to Berlin and John Van Druten’s dramatization of it, I Am a Camera , Cabaret is set in Weimar-era Berlin as American writer Clifford Bradshaw arrives to work on his novel and soak up the debaucherous nightlife. He meets English cabaret performer Sally Bowles and a complex relationship develops, all as the Nazis ascend to power and the spectre of World War II and all its horrors loom on the horizon.\nMuch of the production’s creative team is reprising their work for the Broadway bow, including choreographer Julia Cheng; club, set, and costume designer Tom Scutt; lighting designer Isabella Byrd; sound designer Nick Lidster (for Autograph); and music supervisor and director Jennifer Whyte. Hair and wig design are by Sam Cox, and Guy Common is handling makeup design. Prologue composition and music direction are by Angus MacRae, with Jordan Fein serving as prologue director. Casting is by Bernard Telsey and Kristian Charbonier, and Thomas Recktenwald serves as production stage manager.\nThe revival is the musical’s first new staging on the Main Stem since the 1998 revival, which was also a London transfer. That 1998 production was revived in 2014. Revivals of previous stagings are not uncommon for Cabaret .\nThe oft-produced work premiered in 1966 with Harold Prince at the helm and Joel Grey starring (and winning a Tony Award) as The Emcee. The original staging (with some revisions) was brought back to Broadway, with Grey reprising his performance, in a 1987 revival. The 1998 version of Cabaret , a more dramatic revision of the work, starred Alan Cumming as the Emcee—Cumming won the Tony for his performance and came back with the production when it was revived in 2014.\nThe musical was famously adapted for the big screen by director-choreographer Bob Fosse, with Liza Minnelli starring as Sally Bowles. The film version, considerably darker and seedier than Prince’s staging, won eight Academy Awards and is considered by many one of the best films ever made. Revisions to the stage work since the 1972 film have largely transplanted the film’s energy into the script—along with some of its new songs, including “Mein Herr” and “Maybe This Time.”\nThe Broadway transfer is produced by Ambassador Theatre Group Productions, Underbelly, Gavin Kalin Productions, Hunter Arnold, Smith & Brant Theatricals, and Wessex Grove.\nVisit KitKat.club.\n0\nof\nPhotos: Adam Lambert and Auli’i Cravalho in Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club Photos: Adam Lambert and Auli’i Cravalho in Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club 3 PHOTOS\nAuli’i Cravalho and Adam Lambert in Cabaret\nAuli’i Cravalho in Cabaret\nJulieta Cervantes\nSource link",

    "text": "Actor and musician Will Omar Perez. Photo Courtesy of Will Omar Perez. Will Omar Perez is a Puerto Rican actor, musician, photographer, and content creator. He chatted about his latest endeavors, and the digital age.\nDaily motivations On his daily inspirations as an actor and content creator, he said, “My daily inspiration comes from life itself. Each day offers a new opportunity to explore, learn, and draw from various sources that fuel my creativity.”\n“One of my primary inspirations is the diversity of human experiences. I find inspiration in the stories of people, their struggles, triumphs, and the emotions that make us uniquely human,” he said.\n“Observing the world around me, whether it’s through personal interactions, current events, or the simple beauty of everyday life, provides a constant stream of inspiration,” he added.\nThe digital age On being a part of the digital age, Perez said, “Being a part of the digital age is both exciting and overwhelming. The constant evolution of technology, the prevalence of streaming services, and social media have transformed the way we live, communicate, and consume information.”\n“On one hand, the convenience of having instant access to a vast array of entertainment through streaming platforms is incredible. It’s like having the world’s library and cinema at your fingertips. However, the fast-paced nature of the digital age can also be overwhelming,” he elaborated.\n“On one side, it’s a fantastic way to connect with people globally, share experiences, and stay updated with current events. On the other side, it can lead to information overload and a sense of being constantly plugged in,” he added.\nFuture plans Regarding his future plans, he shared, “On a personal level, I am focused on continued self-growth and cultivating meaningful relationships with those around me. I aspire to maintain a healthy work-life balance that allows me to cherish moments with loved ones while pursuing my passions.”\nPerez continued, “In terms of my professional journey, I am dedicated to grow my craft as an actor and content creator/photographer. This involves continuous learning, staying updated on industry trends, and seeking diverse opportunities that challenge and inspire me.”\n“Collaborating with other creative minds is a key aspect of my vision, as it not only enhances my skills but also contributes to the creation of impactful and compelling content,” he added.\nWill Omar Perez: The Photographer Perez also opened up about his photography. “My journey into photography was a blend of curiosity and a deep appreciation for visual storytelling. I found myself drawn to the idea of freezing moments in time, creating visual narratives that evoke emotions and tell stories beyond words,” he said.\n“The initial spark started when I began exploring my surroundings with a camera in hand. Whether it was the play of light and shadow during golden hours, the vibrant colors of nature, or the candid expressions of people, I discovered that photography provided a unique outlet for my creativity,” he elaborated.\n“Photography, for me, is an ever-evolving journey of self-expression and discovery. It’s a way to share my perspective, tell stories that need to be told, and find beauty in the experiences of life. Whether it’s through the lens of a camera or the lens of my own experiences,” he added.\nCareer-defining moments Perez also revealed some moments that shaped him in his career. “In my childhood, Disney Channel was a significant part of my entertainment, sparking my interest in pursuing a career as an actor. Fast forward to when I turned 20, I landed a role doing background work in the Disney Channel original film ‘Teen Beach Movie’.,” he said.\n“Stepping onto the set for the first time was a surreal experience,” he admitted. “The realization hit me. That moment served as a turning point in my career. It wasn’t just about being on set; it was the tangible proof that dreams could come true with dedication and hard work.”\n“Learning that anything is possible when you put in the effort was a game changing lesson for me, shaping my perspective on the possibilities in the industry,” he added.\nFavorite mottos to live by Regarding his favorite mottos to live by, he said, “One of my favorite mottos to live by is ‘Embrace the Journey.’ Life is an unpredictable adventure, and every experience, whether positive or challenging, contributes to personal growth and learning. It reminds me to appreciate the present moment and find value in the process, not just the destination.”\nHe noted that “Embrace Challenges as Opportunities” is another motto that resonates with him. “Challenges are inevitable, but viewing them as opportunities for growth and learning transforms adversity into a catalyst for personal development. It encourages resilience and a positive mindset in the face of difficulties,” he said.\n” Finally to ‘strive for balance’,” he said. “Balancing various aspects of life, such as work, relationships, and personal well-being, is essential for overall happiness and fulfillment. It’s a reminder to prioritize self-care and maintain a healthy equilibrium in the different facets of life.”\nAdvice for young and aspiring actors and content creators For young and aspiring content creators and actors, he said, “Embrace the learning process, the journey is as important as the destination.”\n“Stay persistent and resilient, rejection is a part of the industry, but it doesn’t define you. View setbacks as stepping stones to improvement. Your dedication will set you apart in the long run,” he said.\nPerez continued, “Networking is crucial for creating opportunities and finding collaborators who share your passion. Genuine connections can lead to valuable insights and collaborative projects.”\n“Create your own opportunities, don’t wait for opportunities to come to you; create them yourself. Whether it’s starting a YouTube channel, producing your short film, or participating in local theater, take initiative in showcasing your talent,” he added.\nIt is important to ‘stay authentic’ Perez encouraged them to “stay authentic, because your uniqueness is your strength.” “Stay true to yourself and bring authenticity to your work. Audiences connect with genuine voices and stories,” he said.\n“Celebrate small wins, acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. It’s essential to recognize and appreciate your progress along the way,” he acknowledged.\n“Prioritize mental and physical well-being, the creative process can be demanding. Take care of your mental and physical well-being. Balancing a healthy lifestyle contributes to sustained creativity and resilience,” he said.\n“Remember, your journey is unique, and success is a subjective concept. Enjoy the process, stay passionate, and let your love for the craft be your driving force. The road may be challenging, but with dedication and perseverance, you’ll find your path to success,” he elaborated.\nSuccess On his definition of success, Perez said, “Success, to me, is a blend of professional achievement, personal fulfillment, and making a positive impact on others. True success, to me, is the combination of these elements.”\nTo learn more about Will Omar Perez, follow him on Instagram .",

    "text": "By Alana Loftus & Erin Rose Humphrey ,\n17 minutes ago McDonald's is taking fast food to a whole new level in Budapest with nightclub vibes for adults. The world's largest fast-food chain has re-launched a restaurant that morphs into a swanky club, complete with all-night DJ sets, thanks to Budapest's rule allowing clubs to stay open until 5 am.\nThis McDonald's branch, which is anything but ordinary, is located inside a railway station in Hungary's capital city. It first opened its doors last September and quickly became a tourist hotspot.\nOriginally planned to operate until the end of 2024, it's now set to run throughout 2025. But it's not stopping there - the restaurant, known for bringing fan-favorite items back , is due for a makeover to modernize its look. The station's historic interiors will be revamped to create a fresh setting for McDonald's innovative project.\nREAD MORE: McRib finally returning to McDonald's - but where exactly remains a mystery\nREAD MORE: Former McDonald's chef discovers where to buy best Big Mac sauce dupe from supermarket\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the space features moving light displays and art installations, including underwater scenes and journeys from outer space, reports the Irish Star .\nCustomers can marvel at the mesmerizing light shows and groove to a DJ set, all while tucking into their McDonald's meal. And of course, this upscale concept from the Golden Arches includes some exclusive menu items, like the Goosey Gustav burger topped with foie gras.\nThe beats are set to drop at 10 pm and keep thumping until the wee hours of 4 am at Nyugati's revamped eatery, according to their site: \"We invite everyone to a special journey to the renovated Nyugati restaurant, where our Nyugati Lounge music program has started.\"\n\"From now on, every Friday and Saturday evening, between 10 pm and 4 am - in addition to your Mekis favorites - we will be waiting for you with light painting and a DJ in one of the world's most beautiful McDonald's restaurants.

    "text": "Preghiera dell’imam nell’università degli accampati anticlericali. E il ministro batte un colpo Ci mancava solo la preghiera islamica in Università. E sono intervenuti ministro e rettore di Torino dopo il caso del sermone musulmano tenuto venerdì scorso, a Palazzo Nuovo, sede delle facoltà umanistiche, da Brahim Baya, esponente della comunità musulmana locale e imam di via Chivasso. Università e ministro sono intervenuti per «condannare» l’inedita novità di un’università, tempio del sapere laico, trasformata in una sorta di moschea, in cui una figura religiosa islamica – ed è immaginabile che a un uomo di Chiesa gli studenti di sinistra non lo avrebbero mai consentito – ha parlato per mezz’ora di fede, di guerra e di Medio oriente, scagliandosi contro Israele, dipinto come «entità genocida» e colonizzatrice, contro la quale ha oltretutto evocato anche una forma di «jihad», vale a dire «uno sforzo per difendere vita, diritti e vera pace». Il Giornale ne ha parlato tre giorni fa, quindi – spiega in una nota l’Università di Torino – la ministra dell’Università e della Ricerca Anna Maria Bernini ha contattato telefonicamente il rettore. Durante la conversazione telefonica, il rettore ha precisato che «il fatto è avvenuto in situazione di occupazione da parte di studenti, i quali impediscono da giorni l’accesso a docenti e personale universitario; quindi sotto la piena responsabilità degli occupanti». Il rettore e la ministra – conclude la nota – hanno quindi condiviso un sentimento di piena condanna sull’accaduto». Il caso suscita particolare impressione se si pensa che gli studenti ebrei – negli atenei – cominciano ad aver paura. L’intervento di ministro e rettore di Torino è stato sollecitato anche dalla protesta di alcuni professori. E ieri ha detto la sua anche l’assessore al Diritto universitario della Regione Piemonte Elena Chiorino: «Un episodio intollerabile, vergognoso, – ha detto – che merita una condanna ferma e dura. Si tratta di una totale mancanza di rispetto verso le vittime della violenza del fanatismo islamico ed è ancor più grave che tutto questo sia accaduto di fronte a studenti all’interno dell’Università». Ma l’imam non si è mostrato affatto preoccupato delle reazioni, «Venerdì – riporta il Corriere Torino – vogliamo organizzare la preghiera al Politecnico».",

Un nacimiento de Navidad causó controversia en Italia debido a que no venía con las figuras tradicionales sino que en lugar de María y José, se mostraban a dos mujeres junto al niño Jesús .\nLos pesebres son bastante populares en Italia, en su mayoría por la religión católica, pues en Italia más de 50 millones de ciudadanos están bautizados y dos tercios de la población (alrededor de 60 millones) se declaran católicos creyentes, esto de acuerdo con estadísticas del Instituto Nazionale di Statistica (Instituto Nacional de Estadística ISTAT).\nSin embargo, con el paso de los años estas tradiciones se han visto envueltas en guerras culturales debido a que la sociedad cada vez se ha vuelto mucho más radical y ha dejado atrás lo conservador.\nFue el párroco Della Sala de la iglesia de los Santos Pedro y Pablo, en Capocastello di Mercogliano, aldea de la provincia Avellino, ubicada a una hora al este de Nápoles, quien defendió dicha representación y esto indicó:\nQuería mostrar con esta escena que las familias ya no son sólo tradicionales. En nuestras parroquias vemos cada vez más niños de los nuevos tipos de familias que existen y forman parte de nuestra sociedad, hijos de separados y divorciados, parejas homosexuales, solteros, madres jóvenes\nDella Sala es conocido por simpatizar en causas LGBT , incluso afirma que su actitud va en línea con la del papa Francisco, quien hace unos días indicó que sacerdotes podrían bendecir a parejas gays.\nVIDEO RELACIONADO: Celebran aprobación de matrimonio gay en Baja California\nMÁS POPULARES Después de 11 días desaparecida: Encuentran cuerpo de Luisa Fernanda en Puebla San Diego Red · 2 min de lectura Su modesta casa quedó atrapada en medio de una construcción de lujo de Miami porque se negó a venderla BBC News Mundo · 11 min de lectura Ni China ni Corea del Norte: la historia del país de América Latina que \"eliminó\" la Navidad del calendario oficial hace más de 100 años CNN Espanol · 5 min de lectura ¿‘Justicia del pantano’?

    "title": "Revolutionizing Water Reuse in Agriculture: A Solution to Climate Change Crisis",
    "text": "In the midst of a global climate crisis, the agriculture sector stands on the precipice of a water scarcity challenge that threatens food security and livelihoods worldwide. As over 70% of freshwater is devoted to agriculture, the ripple effects of dwindling water sources are felt most acutely in this sector. From the parched landscapes of QwaQwa, South Africa, to the fertile but increasingly vulnerable fields of Europe and China, the call for innovative solutions has never been more urgent. Amidst this backdrop, a groundbreaking initiative promises a glimmer of hope, aiming to revolutionize water reuse in agriculture and mitigate the impacts of climate change on this critical sector.\nWater Scarcity: A Looming Threat to Global Agriculture\nThe recent findings from diverse regions underscore the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change. In QwaQwa, South Africa, communities are grappling with water scarcity that not only hampers daily life but also jeopardizes agricultural productivity. This scenario is not isolated. Across the globe, 2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries, with agriculture consuming a lion's share of freshwater resources. The situation is exacerbated in Europe, where extreme weather conditions, including heatwaves, droughts, and floods, are leading to reduced crop yields and escalating water scarcity. The plight of farmers, who find themselves at the mercy of both nature and regulatory frameworks, has sparked protests, especially against EU environmental rules perceived as burdensome. Furthermore, a study focusing on China's agricultural regions warns of a 20% crop yield loss and a 12.2% increase in soil greenhouse gas emissions between 2061 and 2090 due to climate change, illustrating the global scale of the crisis.\nInnovative Solutions on the Horizon\nIn response to the escalating crisis, the AWSAMe initiative emerges as a beacon of hope, advocating for the promotion of drought-resistant and nutritious crops such as millets. This initiative, alongside synergies with other projects like VACS and OCOP, aims to address water scarcity in agriculture through innovative agricultural practices. Moreover, the European Union has set ambitious goals to increase wastewater reuse in agriculture to 6.6 trillion liters, potentially reducing water stress by 5%. The crux of this endeavor lies in ensuring the microbiological safety of reused water, a challenge that a pioneering project seeks to overcome by developing the first solution for the simultaneous, automated quantification of E. coli and Enterococcus sp. in waste and reused water. This solution promises to be fast, automated, affordable, reliable, reusable, and digitized, offering a new frontier in the microbiological quality control of reused water.\nCharting a Sustainable Future for Agriculture\nThe integration of efficient risk-sensitive land use plans, improved early warning systems, and the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles in regions like QwaQwa epitomizes the multifaceted approach needed to combat the challenges posed by climate change. The agriculture sector's reliance on freshwater underscores the imperative for innovative solutions that can ensure sustainable water use without compromising agricultural productivity. The initiatives and studies highlighted herein provide a roadmap for mitigating disaster risks and adapting agricultural practices to the realities of a changing climate. As the global community grapples with these challenges, the concerted efforts of governments, the private sector, and local communities will be pivotal in securing a resilient and sustainable agricultural future.\nIn the face of mounting challenges, the narrative of water scarcity and climate change demands immediate and innovative responses. The initiatives and studies discussed offer a glimpse into the potential for transformative change in the agriculture sector, emphasizing the critical need for sustainable practices and technologies. As the world moves forward, the lessons learned from these endeavours will be essential in shaping a future where agriculture can thrive despite the adversities posed by a changing climate.",
