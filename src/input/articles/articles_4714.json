    "text": "SUMMARY\nThis is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article.\nBETHLEHEM, Palestine – Palestinian Christians held a sombre Christmas vigil in Bethlehem on Saturday, December 23, with candle-lit hymns and prayers for\npeace in Gaza instead of the usual festive celebrations at the spot where they believe Jesus Christ was born.\nMost years Bethlehem basks in the central place it holds in the Christian story of Jesus’ life, born there in a stable because there was no room for his parents at the inn, and placed in an animal’s manger, the humblest of all possible beds.\nSome 2,000 years later, pilgrims usually flock to the reputed location of that stable in Bethlehem’s Byzantine-era Church of the Nativity, where most Christmases there are joyful displays of lights and trees in Manger Square.\nBut with\nIsrael’s campaign in Gaza having killed more than 20,000 people according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, the mostly Palestinian population of Bethlehem in the Occupied West Bank are in mourning too.\nThis year they decided to have\nno large tree, the usual centerpiece of Bethlehem’s Christmas celebrations because of the carnage taking place only 50km (30 miles) away.\nAnd in place of the usual nativity scene, as Christians call the traditional display of figurines representing the holy family, Bethlehem churches this year placed the models amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n“Bethlehem is a message. It is not a city, it is a message of peace to the whole world. From this sacred place we convey a message of peace…stop the war, stop the blood, the killing and the revenge,” said Father Ibrahim Faltas, a friar at the vigil.\nChristians make up around 2% of the population across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories, according to Protecting Holy Land Christians, a campaign organized by the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, with a smaller proportion in Gaza.\nMeanwhile, the war, triggered by a\nHamas attack on Israeli towns on October 7 that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, has kept away the majority of expected foreign tourists hoping to celebrate Christmas in Bethlehem.\nWhen church leaders convened at Bethlehem in early December to mark the start of Advent, as Christians call the weeks before Christmas, there were few people in the usually crowded streets and squares to watch the pared-down display.\n“This Christmas comes to Bethlehem in a different shape. Nowadays Bethlehem, as any other Palestinian city, is in mourning. We feel sad,” said the town mayor Hanna Hanania, lighting a candle in Manger Square. – Rappler.com\nAdd a comment\nThere are no comments yet. Add your comment to start the conversation.",

    "text": "Canka, Virtus bets on the former UCLA player: \"I can't wait to start this adventure.\" Serie A Basketball The company does not stop: on Friday, president Zanetti will announce the sponsor used in the Italian championship. di ALESSANDRO GALLO July 16th, 2025 Abramo Canka, born in 2002, grew up in Stella Azzurra and then in Roseto\nBorn in Genoa to a Kosovar mother and Senegalese father: the world Virtus welcomes Abraham Canka , raised in Stella Azzurra, passed through Roseto and seen at work, in the NCAA, with a prestigious jersey, that of UCLA. To understand, UCLA is to the NCAA, as the Celtics and the Lakers are to the NBA. Born in 2002, he will share his minutes as a forward with Karim Jallow and with Saliou Niang, who just yesterday left Trento taking advantage of a clause that allowed him to interrupt his contract in case of a call from a club of Euroleague .\nLike Jallow, Canka also shared his first words with the Bianconeri. \"I'm proud and honored to wear the colors of the Italian champions. I'm ready to make myself available and can't wait to start working for Virtus.\"\nJuventus general manager Paolo Ronci discussed the salary (a multi-year deal, meaning two guaranteed years plus options) and the reasons for the decision. \"The final part of last season demonstrated the importance of having players who are available to meet the team's needs with determination and total dedication to the collective result. Abramo was a member of the national youth teams before gaining significant experience abroad, especially considering he was born in 2002. We decided to give him the opportunity to return to Italy and welcome him into the Virtus family.\"\nA choice with a view to the future, also considering the undoubted abilities shown by Dusko Ivanovic , capable of improving the human resources at its disposal. But there's a lot on the table at Juventus: a press conference has been announced for Friday. President Massimo Zanetti will be present with the new sponsor. Negotiations are being conducted personally by the owner, who, as he has said in the past, would not ignore the idea of having one brand for Italy and one for Europe. The one presented on Friday (there's talk of a company linked to the energy sector) will be the sponsor for the championship.\nReiterating that Virtus will now have to announce Niang once he returns from the States, it's worth noting that Momo Diouf will be at the Playground—where he was awarded, but obviously didn't play. Once Niang is announced, the final piece of the puzzle would remain. Ivanovic and Ronci have agreed to sign a player who can move easily between the four and five positions. Trevion Williams, 24, who was Jallow's teammate at Ulm, is also being discussed. A drawback, given the parameters set by Ivanovic and Ronci, is that he's a center, not a four. If things are rosy, they'll be fine.\n© All rights reserved\nContinue reading all the sports news on",
