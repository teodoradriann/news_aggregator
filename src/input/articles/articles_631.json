    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | Warrington Guardian",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Roboski massacre victims commemorated with demand for justice 12 years on 12 years after the massacre that killed 34 people, including 19 children, in the village of Roboski in the southeastern province of Şırnak, the village still bears the lasting scars of the massacre as justice remains elusive. Then-Prime Minister Erdoğan did not keep his promises he gave in the aftermath of the massacre, said Sadık Alma who lost his son in the Turkish army airstrikes. Hacı Bişkin / Gazete Duvar Roboski villagers in the southeastern province of Şırnak and politicians commemorated on Dec. 28 those killed in an airstrike, as the village continues to exhibit pain and suffering 12 years on. A total of 34 people, mostly children, were killed in an airstrike by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) in Şırnak's border village of Roboski on Dec. 28, 2011. The bombs left bodies dismembered, with families unable to identify their loved ones. The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) Party co-chair Tülay Hatimoğulları also attended the commemoration. Sadık Alma, who lost his son 25-year-old Nadir Alma in the massacre, said that his pain is still fresh. Alma, who was among the delegation that met with the then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said that Erdoğan did not keep his promise he gave after the massacre. Alma said the attitude towards Kurds in Turkey has not changed 12 years on. “They tried to silence us. We did not remain silent. We resisted. Lawsuits were filed against us. But at this point, we, as Roboski families, have given up hope.” Then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with the Roboski families for the first time on July 26, 2013. “Erdoğan told us, 'I know about the case. I did not give the (airstrike) instruction. If you want, get the compensation, we will give you some positions from the state. I know everything. I promise to do my best.’ 12 years have passed. He didn't keep his promise. He was implicitly implying that the lawsuit we filed as Roboski families would not yield any results. That’s what happened,” Alma said. “They tried to silence us by offering (public employee) positions. If you are wondering, let me tell you that most of the compensation mentioned was not given either,” he added. Alma lastly noted that Erdoğan was covering up Roboski, but “the world knows what happened in Roboski. This massacre took place in front of the world.” Zeynep Encu, who lost 11 of her relatives in the airstrike, said they had more anger than mourning. “We were detained. Our houses were raided. A mother's son was murdered, one son was taken into custody, and one went to prison. The massacre was covered up. This silence made us very tired. We will not give up on our case. Many parties visited us. We have a request from them. When they go to the parliamentary rostrum, let them say justice to Roboski with one voice. Let them reopen the closed file,” she said. The Roboski families' search for justice both in domestic courts and in the international arena failed. Right after the massacre, the families filed a complaint in order for those responsible to be tried, but after years of waiting, a military prosecutor's office dismissed the case. The families in 2014 took the case to the Constitutional Court, which deemed it inadmissible due to errors in the submission that stemmed from the Şırnak Bar Association's serious mistakes. The latest blow to the Roboski families was dealt by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) when it dismissed their appeal on the grounds that domestic legal means weren't exhausted since the files weren't submitted properly to the Constitutional Court. On the other hand, former main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) deputy Levent Gök had a monument built for Roboski with the proceeds of his book “Roboski: Uludere’s Tears,” Ceren Bayar from Gazete Duvar reported. The monument, which could not be placed due to winter conditions, will be placed in the village when the winter conditions disappear. \"I commemorate with mercy the 34 civilians who were bombed and murdered in Uludere 12 years ago. We will not let this massacre be forgotten until all those responsible, who are protected because of a lack of effective investigation, are tried and the truth is revealed,\" CHP leader Özgür Özel said in a tweet. Uludere'de 12 yıl önce bombalanarak katledilen 34 sivil yurttaşımızı rahmetle anıyorum.— Özgür Özel (@eczozgurozel) Bu katliamı etkili soruşturma yapılamadığı için korunan tüm sorumlular yargılanana ve gerçekler açığa çıkana kadar unutturmayacağız.

    "text": "Garmin Venu 2 Plus is a solid fitness smartwatch Speaker 1: Garmin's latest watch is trying to bridge the gap between fitness and smart watch and spoiler alert. It does a pretty darn good job. This is the venue two plus let's take it for a spin. If you are familiar with some of Garmin's earlier watches, specifically the venue two and two S release in 2021. There's not too much of a surprise when it comes to the functionality and look and feel of the venue two plus it's all in the name. That plus means that there are a couple [00:00:30] of extra features, specifically a speaker and microphone on board. That means you'll be able to talk to your voice assistant, take quick calls on your wrist and even respond to text messages using your and dictation looks wise. This watch is very similar to the venue. Two series. It's got a round Amy display. It's bright. It's really easy to see in broad daylight. Speaker 1: And there is an auto brightness sensor on board. This watch comes in only one size 43 millimeters that is different from the venue two [00:01:00] series, which did have two and sizes. And it kind of splits the difference between the two. If you have a smaller risk, you might find that some Watchers can overwhelm you. But this one I actually found was a pretty happy medium. I didn't find that it was too big at all. And I definitely enjoyed the extra real estate on the screen elsewhere on the exterior, there is one extra button on the side and a speaker on the opposite side. Now, when you long press that button in the middle, it brings up your voice assistant, either Siri and iOS. [00:01:30] It is Google assistant or Biby when you're on Android and good news. Yes, it is compatible with Android and iOS. That button can also be programmed to have a shortcut when you press it just once. Speaker 1: I like to, to be my music app, the good news about the speaker is that it can actually get fairly loud. You can listen to prompts from your voice assistant, obviously as well as callers. When you are in a phone call and moral crucially. For me, it's kind of an odd thing, but it does actually play music [00:02:00] without wireless Evers. You might be thinking Lexi, like why on earth would I wanna listen to music on my tiny watch speaker? Let me tell you if you like me and you're forgetful and you don't take earbuds sometimes and you go out on a run or an outdoor workout. It's pretty nice to be able to have this as a backup, to listen to some songs, to keep you motivated. The downside is you're not gonna be able to control any watch functionality using your voice. Say, for example, [00:02:30] you wanna just press the assistant button and start a workout with your voice. Speaker 1: You can't do that yet on this watch. It's really just acting as a go between to get you to the assistant on your phone, but I didn't find it to be that much of a downside at all. And when it came to calls and call quality, I actually found a lot of people that I was talking to on the phone said that my voice sounded pretty clear when I was talking into my watch and it was fairly good at isolating. And the speaker quality from my end was actually pretty good as well for just quick short calls. I wouldn't be sitting there [00:03:00] and having a full on conversation for an hour, but I guess I could, if I really wanted to, the fitness and health features are lifted from the venue two series. And if you wanna see a full, deep dive into everything, as well as testing of all of those features, I've linked my full review of that watch in the description below. Speaker 1: But the shorts story is you're getting things like blood oxygen tracking, both on demand and through the day and night, if you want it, there is a built-in GPS. There are some animation workouts to help you target certain muscle [00:03:30] groups. When you are say doing weights, for example, there's sleep tracking. And there's also the garment body battery, which is giving you an idea of how much you have left in the tank based on variables like your overall activity levels and your heart rate variability. There's also high and low heart rate alerts like the venue too. This watch also has music storage on board, including third party apps like Amazon music and Spotify. There's also a range of third party apps. You can down load through [00:04:00] the connect IQ store, and you can also see notifications coming through on your wrist from Android and iOS, but only quick replies are going to be able to be sent from this watch when you up paired with an Android. Speaker 1: But most importantly is battery life. And this is a big one. You might be familiar with some watches like, you know, the apple watch Galax see, watch. You're really struggling to get to multiple days on them. This watch can get you nine days. That's Garmin's claim real world testing [00:04:30] is a little bit different, of course, because everybody's usage patterns will vary. I found that I was actually getting a week and then change. So almost eight days out of this work on a full charge that was getting notifications. One GPS workout a day. I'm not gonna lie. I wasn't super active over the Christmas break when I was doing most of this testing, but still I think it was fairly real world usage notifications coming through from your wrist and an occasional use of the voice assistant. Obviously when you're doing things [00:05:00] like pull music across to your watch, I found that the battery drained quicker, and also if your screen brightness is on really high all of the time, of course it's gonna eat into your battery life, but honestly, a week's worth of battery life of really nice change. Speaker 1: But now for the big one, the price, the venue two plus is 450 us dollars. That's really the only significant knock that I have against this watch is that it is more expensive than the venue two and two S for having the [00:05:30] extra speaker and micro functionality on board. I wish the garment didn't hike the price, especially because the venue two and two S have a price reduction now to $350. So it is more of a gap between the watches, but the good news is if say you don't want a speaker in microphone, you can look at the venue two series. I gave them an editor's choice award because they're really good watches. Um, and you can save a little bit of cash that way too, but there's something about this watch. I really Speaker 2: Feel like it is becoming a true equal to [00:06:00] the app watches and the galaxy watches of this world. Especially if you want extra fitness features and a lot of extra battery life. Because to me, that's a huge draw card of the watch stay tuned for my full review, which I will link in text for in the description below, you can also find latest pricing and availability of this watch and the other two watches that I mentioned as well. If you have questions for me about extra functionality, things that this watch has, or doesn't have, you can hit me [00:06:30] up in the comments below, or find me on your favorite social media channels. Thanks for watching. And I'll see you next time.

    "text": "Türkiye on Saturday announced it had successfully tested its first military turbofan engine, a major breakthrough in the nation’s drive to rely on domestic technologies to curb external dependency on critical equipment.\nThe TF6000 jet engine has been designed to help Türkiye gain capabilities and technology on its path to developing a power unit for its first fifth-generation fighter jet, KAAN, which recently performed its inaugural flight , a statement by the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB) said.\n\"Türkiye’s first national turbofan engine TF6000, powered by the energy of our homeland sons, has been successfully tested for the first time in the national engine test system,” said SSB President Haluk Görgün.\nDeveloped by TUSAŞ Engine Industries (TEI), the engine is expected to power the unmanned fighter jet, Kızılelma, and Anka-3, the country’s first flying-wing, deep-strike unmanned aerial vehicle, Görgün said.\n“I sincerely congratulate everyone involved in the project, especially our engineers and technical teams,” he noted.\nA joint venture between Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) and GE Aerospace, TEI develops and produces engines for aircraft and missiles.\nThe company is currently developing its most powerful turbofan jet engine , the TF10000, an upgraded version of the TF6000, which is expected to produce 6,000 lbf of thrust.\nTürkiye’s first national turbofan engine, TF6000, is seen during its inaugural test on March 9, 2024. (AA Photo)\nKızılelma, the fifth-generation unmanned fighter jet, performed its first flight in mid-December 2022. Its mass production is expected to start this year.\nBacked by an artificial intelligence system, Kızılelma represents a significant expansion of capabilities for slow-moving reconnaissance and missile-carrying drones. It promises to increase the existing platforms' top speed and carrying capacity.\nIts exterior features are similar to those of fifth-generation fighter jets. In addition to conventional drone missions, it can conduct air-to-air engagements.\nAs for Anka-3, the first vertical tailless drone took to the skies for the first time in late December 2023.\nAs a new-generation UAV platform, it will be capable of performing different missions, such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and intelligence, with air-ground munitions, air-to-air ammunition, and radar systems.\nIt can perform many tasks, such as operation and communication relays, together with other friendly elements.\nAlong with the TF6000 and TF10000 jet engine projects, Türkiye is also expected to complete the design, development, and manufacturing stages of the related accessory subsystems, fan module, variable stator vane compressor, flow mixer exhaust, and afterburner.\nThe TF10000, envisaged to power many manned and unmanned aviation platforms, including KAAN, is almost complete, Mahmut Faruk Akşit, the head of TEI, said last month.\nUnveiled publicly last year, KAAN is aimed at replacing the aging F-16 fleet in the inventory of the Air Forces Command, which is planned to be phased out starting in the 2030s. The project was launched in 2016.\nIt conducted its inaugural flight last month. The mass production of the initial batch is envisaged as of 2028.\nKAAN is planned to be powered by an F110 engine, developed by General Electric before eventually being replaced with a domestically built power unit manufactured by TEI.\nThe jet will make Türkiye one of the few countries with the infrastructure and technology to produce a fifth-generation combat aircraft.\nTEI has already developed PD170, tailored for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including those of the drone magnate Baykar and TAI's own drones.\nIt is preparing to launch mass production of an engine that will power choppers, including Türkiye's first domestically developed heavy-class attack helicopter, the Atak-2.\nshortlink copied Last Update: Mar 10, 2024 5:49 pm RELATED TOPICS fight-against-terrorism DEUTSCHE-BANK US-LIBYA-RELATIONS KEYWORDS defense industry defense türkiye engine turkish jet engine tf6000 jet engine indigenous jet engine fighter jet kaan The Daily Sabah Newsletter Keep up to date with what’s happening in Turkey, it’s region and the world.

    "title": "From a College Campus to a War Zone: Bringing comfort, compassion, and joy to the soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War",
    "text": "After graduating from college in 1968, Debby Moore of Haymarket wanted to travel and see the world before following in her parents’ footsteps and becoming a teacher. Most young women would have chosen to go to London, Paris or some other swanky destination. Not Moore.\nAfter learning that a civilian program through the Department of the Army lowered the minimum age from 23 to 21 for young, single, female college graduates, she went for an interview for a job with Army Special Services. Shortly after, she found herself heading to Vietnam, right into a war zone.\nMoore’s mission, she came to find out, was operating recreation centers, or clubs, for the enlisted soldiers where they could relax and have time away from their officers and NCOs during breaks from combat. Here, they could enjoy coffee, punch, popcorn, games, cards, ping pong, pool tables, musical instruments and more.\nShe and the club’s director, Louise, planned monthly events such as movie nights, bingo, pool tournaments, and unit parties. They were the only two women serving over 1000 men and lived right alongside junior medevac pilots.\n“Medevac pilots or ‘Dust Off’ pilots as they’re called, like my husband, are those who bravely fly into combat to rescue the wounded and dead,” said Moore. “These guys were great and adopted us like sisters.” Moore and Louise were also sometimes the last American girls these pilots would ever see.\nOne of her favorite experiences in Vietnam was hosting orphans’ parties at the centers. Families of soldiers would send toys, clothing, and treats to support these events. “The children would sing and dance for our soldiers and our guys would simply melt at the sight of their smiles, temporarily forgetting the nasty side of the war.”\nIn addition to running these recreation centers, she and Louise were asked to learn about the missions of different units on their basecamps. “We would often visit their work sites where we would listen and empathize with their feelings about daily encounters with fellow soldiers, their superiors, local nationals, and, most importantly, the enemy!” she said.\nWhile the soldiers were often in danger, so were the female civilians who were there to help them. Moore stated that 7,484 American women served in Vietnam during the war and 68 of them lost their lives there. Eight were military nurses and the others worked for the Red Cross, Army Special Services, and other organizations.\nShe herself lived through the terror of rocket and mortar attacks on her base camps while serving at Soc Trang, Cu Chi, and Dong Tam. Enemy forces even got onto the roof of her service club at Cu Chi during an incursion during Tet of 1969. The soldiers would always make sure she and Louise got into the bunkers safely.\nAfter returning to the United States for good in 1970, Moore did go on to pursue a teaching career, but what she experienced during her two tours in Vietnam changed her perception of herself and the world.\n“I learned more about myself than I ever would have had I gone directly into teaching,” she said. “I value my time with those wonderful young soldiers and the Vietnamese nationals I came into contact with. I also learned a lot about our ‘world family’ and their cultures and understand that Americans can also learn valuable lessons from these encounters. Mostly, I think about the friendships we developed, however short, and I will always remember those I knew who served and gave ‘their all.’”\nIn addition to wanting to support these soldiers, another reason she went to Vietnam had to do with her father. “As the eldest of four daughters, I felt very close to my father who was a B-29 commander during World War II, flying thirteen bombing missions over Japan,” said Moore. “I’m so proud of his service.”\nIn 2016, she was asked to speak about the women who served in Vietnam at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Veterans Day. “I’ve been to the Wall many times and always touch the names of the men I knew who lost their lives there, but each time I go, I stare at the Wall and wonder how many more of the thousands of soldiers I spoke with during my two years in Country have their names etched there. I will never know, but I’m so happy that I might have been a small part of their lives during our time there.”\nIn 2023, on Veterans Day, the Vietnam Women’s Memorial in D.C. celebrated its 30th anniversary. Moore and her husband, retired U.S. Army Colonel Doug Moore, were there to honor the occasion along with the founder of the memorial, former Army Nurse Diane Carlson-Evans, and best-selling author Kristin Hannah.\nAlthough the couple, who live in Haymarket, didn’t marry until later in life, they met long ago and far away. “In early January of 1969, a young major named Doug Moore flew me from Soc Trang to Cu Chi when I was transferred there,” she said. “I flew with him and his pilots for the next six months until I went home from my first tour. After that, I didn’t see him again for 45 years until we met at the Vietnam Women’s Memorial on Veterans Day in 2013. We were married two years later.”\nColonel Moore also served his country well. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism, only second to the Medal of Honor, along with two Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Purple Heart and many other awards. He has also written a book, A Bullet Through the Helmet, about his experience.\nAlthough some of Debby Moore’s experiences in Vietnam were extremely difficult, she never regretted her decision to serve. “In the encounters I had with those incredible men, I learned more about the human spirit than I ever learned in all of my sociology and psych classes, and rarely a day goes by without my being reminded of their bravery, fortitude, and sacrifice. Even now, more than fifty years later, I still ache for those men and the choices they had to make.”\n# # #\nThis feature appears in the January 2024 issue of Haymarket-Gainesville Lifestyle magazine You can view the entire issue here:\nhttps://issuu.com/pamkamphuis/docs/hglm_jan_2024_web, and pick up copies at these locations.",

    "title": "España eliminará el IVA del aceite de oliva para suavizar los efectos de la sequía en el precio - MarketScreener",
    "text": "MADRID, 21 jun (Reuters) - El Gobierno español planea reducir a cero el tipo del impuesto sobre el valor añadido del aceite de oliva a partir de julio, después de que los precios al por mayor se triplicaran con creces debido a una grave sequía en la región sureña Andalucía, informó el viernes el Ministerio de Hacienda.\nLos precios del aceite de oliva se dispararon a niveles récord el año pasado, después de que la cosecha de aceitunas cayera en picado debido a una sequía de dos años en Andalucía, la mayor zona productora de un país que suele suministrar alrededor del 40% de la producción mundial.\nLos precios han bajado un poco este año, pero siguen rondando máximos históricos.\n\"Esta medida tiene como objetivo proteger e incentivar el consumo del aceite de oliva, un producto saludable y cuyo precio se ha encarecido recientemente como resultado de la sequía, entre otros motivos\", dijo el ministerio en un comunicado, añadiendo que la medida se aprobará el martes y entrará en vigor a partir del 1 de julio.\nLa escalada del precio del aceite de oliva ha afectado a la vida cotidiana de los españoles, ya que es un alimento básico en la gastronomía del país.\nLas botellas de un litro de aceite de oliva virgen extra llegaron a costar 14,5 euros (15,77 dólares) en algunos supermercados a finales del año pasado, lo que propulsó al aceite de oliva a la categoría de productos que los minoristas equipan con etiquetas de seguridad, junto con las bebidas espiritosas, los cosméticos y los electrodomésticos.\nEl año pasado, el Gobierno ya había reducido el IVA del aceite de oliva del 10% original al 5%.\nSin embargo, las abundantes lluvias caídas en las últimas semanas en toda España son un buen augurio para la próxima campaña oleícola, y los responsables del sector esperan que los precios bajen a principios del año que viene, ya que es probable que se recupere la oferta.\nPor otra parte, el Gobierno ha anunciado que el aceite de oliva se considerará un alimento básico, por lo que se le aplicará un IVA reducido del 4% cuando se normalicen las condiciones del mercado. Sin embargo, no ha precisado por cuánto tiempo se mantendrá en el 0%.\n(Información de Inti Landauro y Corina Pons; editado por Sharon Singleton; editado en español por Javi West Larrañaga)\nComparte © Reuters - 2024",
