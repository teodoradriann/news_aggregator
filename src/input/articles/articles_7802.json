    "title": "Pakistani Islamist parties rally against top judge on blasphemy accusations -February 23, 2024 at 10:34 am | MarketScreener",
    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice.\nThe protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous.\nThe court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months.\n\"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful.\nHundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan.\nThe top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis.\n\"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa.\nThe campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8.\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice.\nJudges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard.\nBlasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\n(Reporting by Asif Shahzad in Islamabad, Ariba Shahid in Karachi and Mushtaq Ali in Peshawar; Editing by Peter Graff)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "A very dry and warm October has raised the possibility of wildfire in New Hampshire, with officials declaring today as the first “high” fire danger day of the season. The risk is unlikely to improve any time soon, with little or no rain in the forecast for at least a week. October has seen very little rain throughout the Northeast, and the past week has seen unusually high temperatures, with many locations setting records for late October. The southern half of New Hampshire is currently listed as “moderately dry,” the first step on the national scale measuring drought, with the Seacoast area listed as already being in “moderate drought.” Much of the U.S. has seen a very dry autumn after a wet spring and normal summer. The National Weather Service says that this may be the driest October on record for the country as a whole. As for wildfire danger, the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands ranks it using the five-point National Fire Danger Rating System, which takes into account temperature, humidity, recent weather conditions as well as conditions on the ground. High fire danger is the third step on the scale, with wildfires considered “likely” and “difficult to control under windy conditions.” Many fire departments ban outdoor burning when high fire danger is declared by the state. Autumn is often a time of high fire danger in New England as leaves fall off the trees before cold weather sets in, allowing sunlight to get to the ground and dry out material, creating more combustible material. ••• These articles are being shared by partners in the Granite State News Collaborative.

    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — This warmer weather is a great time to be outside. What better spot to be than at a park? Grand Rapids is getting ready to welcome a new one.\nThe city of Grand Rapids is going to create four and a half acres of green space right next to the new amphitheater. The last time the city undertook a project near this size was more than a decade ago. The city explains that they plan to start working later this month.\nGrand Rapids parks are a popular spot for many.\n“It’s just a good way to get fresh air,” Paul Mueller said.\nMueller and his fiancée are enjoying the sun and warmer weather.\n“It’s so nice out; we figure we gotta start getting our miles in,” Mueller added.\nThe two love being at parks — especially right now.\n“So honestly, like, the last week, it's kind of been like, ‘Okay, let's go to a new park. Try to rotate through all of them.’ It's really just nice to get a variety too,” Mueller said.\nGrand Rapids is getting ready to add a new park to the city's growing list.\n“I mean, Grand Rapids has been growing for the last decade, and we just love to see it just keep getting bigger and better,” Austin Burrill said.\nThe area is currently blocked off by a fence and overgrown brush. The park is adding several new features, including stadium-level seating, river access, and access to the new amphitheater.\n“The project will include a multi-use pathway, about a half-mile stretch of pathway, four and a half acres of new green space being created, some scenic views of the river in the downtown, with some seat steps and seat walls along that pathway and opportunities for future public art to be displayed,” Grand Rapids City Engineer Tim Burkman said.\nThis project is estimated to cost $17 million. Burkman explains that the money comes from the Greenway Grant and capital improvement funds.\n“It's a beautiful vision, opening up access to spaces that didn't exist before,” Burkman added.\nThe last time the city saw a project of this size was more than a decade ago. The city explains that Pleasant Park and Tremont Park were both less than two and a half acres in size.\n“Really inviting people in, drawing them into the river, creating additional non-motorized transportation opportunities adjacent to the river just will be, I think, a tremendous amenity that's being added to our river edge,” Burkman explained.\nMany are eager to see the park completed.\n“It'll probably be busy at first, which is great, you know; it gets used. But I think there's no harm in it. I think it only benefits everyone involved,” Mueller added.\nThe city explains that it plans to have a portion of this project done by April 2026, so it coincides with the opening of the amphitheater.\nFollow FOX 17: Facebook - X (formerly Twitter) - Instagram - YouTube",

Records: UC Davis 12-9 (6-4 Big West), UC Riverside 14-8 (7-3 Big West) The short story: It was a heart breaker on the road for UC Davis, falling to UC Riverside 60-58 on a last-second three-pointer by Nate Pickens with just four seconds remaining. Despite a valiant effort that included a game-high 20 points from TY Johnson and a near double-double from Niko Rocak, the Aggies couldn't hold off the Highlanders in a game that featured 12 lead changes throughout the night. COURT SIDE Johnson, the senior from Chicago, led the Aggies with 20 points, eight rebounds, and two steals This was Johnson's 13th game this season scoring 20 or more points, and 35th of his career Connor Sevilla continued dialing it in from distance with three crucial three-pointers on his way to 15 points on the night Rocak filled up the box score and had a near double-double, scoring eight points to go along with 10 rebounds, four assists, and two blocks UC Davis won the rebounding battle 34-33, largely in part to Rocak's 10 boards leading the way The Aggie defense forced 12 turnovers, converting them into 15 points on the other end UC Davis shot 41.4% from the field (24-58) UC Riverside's Kaleb Smith and Rikus Schulte combined for 24 points, while Pickens hit the game-winning three-pointer, his only basket of the game HOW IT HAPPENED UC Davis opened the game with a strong defensive effort, holding UC Riverside to just one point in the first five minutes and building an 8-1 lead The Aggies asserted their presence inside early, scoring 14 of their 26 first-half points in the painted area which set the tone for the first 20 minutes UC Riverside responded with a 7-0 run to take a 20-16 lead, but the Aggies closed the half strong A late three-pointer from Johnson capped a 6-0 run, giving UC Davis a 26-24 halftime advantage The second half was a back-and-forth battle much like the first-half, with neither team leading by more than six points UC Davis surged ahead 34-30 after a jumper from Sevilla, but UC Riverside answered with a 7-0 run, fueled by a pair of baskets from Schulte to retake the lead Sevilla's perimeter scoring which ignited the previous run, would again spark another Aggie scoring portion of the game, hitting three three-pointers in the final eight minutes, including one to tie the game at 40-40 The back-and-forth action would continue to progress into the final stages of the game with eight of the games 12 lead changes taking place after the game was tied up at the 40-40 score Helping the Aggies trade baskets with the Highlanders not only was Sevilla but Carl Daughtery Jr., who scored all nine of his points in the second half A seemingly pivotal moment came with 49 seconds left when a reversed call gave UC Davis possession with a 56-55 lead Johnson capitalized with a clutch pull-up jumper to extend the lead to 58-55 with 30 seconds remaining UC Riverside responded with two free throws from Barrington Hargress and forced a turnover on the ensuing possession With four seconds left, Pickens hit the game-winning three-pointer, his only basket of the night UC Davis had one final chance, but Johnson's three-point attempt at the buzzer rimmed out TY doing what he does 💪📺 ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/GqB9vKWlbf— UC Davis Men's Basketball (@ucdavismbb) January 31, 2025 UP NEXT: UC Davis will continue their road-stand with a trip to first-place UC Irvine this Saturday, Feb. 1 at 1 p.m. PT.Print Friendly Version Read Full Article",
