    "title": "With temperatures soaring in Paris Olympics, Sports Ministry dispatches 40 ACs for Indian athletes - The Economic Times",
    "text": "Indian athletes battling the soaring temperatures and lack of cooling in their rooms in the Paris Olympic Games Village have been provided with 40 portable air conditioners by the country's sports ministry to make their stay comfortable. The air-conditioners were sent to the Games village after discussions with the Indian Olympic Association and the French Embassy here, according to sources in the ministry. Taking into consideration the issues faced by athletes at the Olympic Games village because of the temperature and humidity in Paris, the Ministry of Sports decided to provide 40 ACs in the Games Village rooms where the Indian athletes are staying, the source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Temperatures have soared in both Paris and Chateauroux, the two main Olympic Games venues. In the men's 50m rifle 3-positions event, all the eight finalists, including India's bronze-winner Swapnil Kusale, were seen sweating profusely at the Chateauroux shooting range. There are reports that temperatures have touched an unbearable 40 degrees Celsius on some days in Paris. Even before the Games started, several contingents had expressed their concerns about the weather in Paris after the organisers said that they would shun air conditioning to cut the carbon footprint of the event. Instead, the Games organising committee unveiled an underfloor cooling mechanism and built-in insulation to keep the temperatures down at the Games Village. However, unconvinced about the measures, the USA contingent travelled with portable conditioners. Reports have suggested that other countries have also resorted to buying portable ACs to manage the heat. India has now joined the bandwagon. The decision was taken early on Friday and the cost is being funded by the Ministry, the ministry source said. The ACs are plug and play units and athletes have already started using them. It is expected that with this they will have a more comfortable stay and get better rest which is much needed for a good performance, he added.",

It requires specialized equipment and knowledge to ensure thorough cleaning without damaging surfaces. Renting or purchasing a pressure washer can be costly, and operating it safely and effectively takes experience.\nHiring a professional pressure washing service in Bel Air saves you time, energy, and the hassle of figuring out how to clean every nook and cranny of your property.

Protects Your Property from Damage\nNot\nMr. Clean Power Washing LLC all surfaces are created equal, and using the wrong pressure or technique can cause significant damage.

Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC uses eco-friendly cleaning solutions that are tough on grime but safe for your property and the environment.\n5.

If left untreated, these substances can cause wear and tear, leading to costly repairs or replacements down the line. For example, algae and mold growth can deteriorate wood decks, while dirt buildup on concrete can lead to cracks and erosion.\nRegular pressure washing helps extend the life of your exterior surfaces by keeping them clean and free from damaging contaminants.

    "text": "\"I have ordered the activation of a joint defensive action of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces\" off the coast of Essequibo, he said in a state televised broadcast, but did not provide more information.Earlier this month, the British media reported, citing a British defense ministry spokesman, that the United Kingdom would deploy a patrol ship off Guyana's coast as a sign of support for the state in the territorial dispute over Essequibo. The head of Venezuela's defense ministry, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, called it a provocation.Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ivan Gil had previously called on his British counterpart David Cameron not to interfere in the affairs of Latin American and Caribbean countries, and to mind his own business.Venezuela's territorial dispute with Britain and Guyana, a former British colony, has been ongoing since the 19th century. The Bolivarian government stepped up its actions after Guyanese authorities began handing over fossil-rich areas of the disputed shelf to oil companies for development.Caracas held a referendum on December 3 in which an absolute majority of participants supported the annexation of the territory west of the Essequibo River, and began legislative work to legally back its actions.Guyana's President Irfaan Ali has since said that the country views Caracas' actions as a threat to national security and intends to appeal to the UN Security Council as well as its international partners. During a recent news conference, Ali did not rule out that Guyana may go for a military base for its allies in the region, and on December 7, the US Army's Southern Command carried out \"flight operations\" in the country.The leaders of Venezuela and Guyana, following recent talks on the territorial dispute over Essequibo, pledged not to use force under any circumstances and to resolve it in accordance with the 1966 Geneva Agreement. https://sputnikglobe.com/20231209/maduro-signs-decrees-to-incorporate-essequibo-into-venezuela-1115495905.html united kingdom (uk) venezuela americas guyana",

    "text": "Newswise — Tens of thousands of Boeing workers overwhelming voted to strike and many of them took to the company’s headquarters in Washington state early Friday morning to start picketing. Roughly 96% of union members voted Thursday to reject a proposed deal with the company that would have significantly boosted pay and benefits, but fell short of other union demands. If you’re looking for more context on this matter, please consider Jungho Suh , a teaching assistant professor of management at the George Washington University School of Business. His areas of expertise include service management, diversity, equity, and inclusion, entrepreneurship, human resource issues in the service industry, sustainability & ESG reporting in the travel industry, digital platforms in tourism & hospitality, and gastronomy tourism. \"Boeing workers' overwhelming vote to strike underscores a broader discontent within labor forces, despite offers of increased pay and benefits. It reflects a deeper struggle for dignity, equity, and sustainable work conditions in a high-stakes industry,” Suh says. “As negotiations unfold, Boeing’s stakeholders find themselves at a pivotal moment, grappling with the reality of how advanced technology is reshaping the workplace and prompting urgent questions about the future of work and equitable labor conditions in the age of artificial intelligence.\" If you would like to speak with Professor Suh, please contact GW Senior Media Relations Specialist Cate Douglass at [[email protected]]https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/273/6ek5y9a7ujkh3isntb4553y16/2/ee5c25bc37f090343e6d8d92a123417ec244dabaec9dcd3f39229ce50810bd66. -GW-",

    "text": "Since the 80s, one of the largest Stations of the Cross in Bogotá has been held in the town of Ciudad Bolívar, south of the city, every Good Friday during Holy Week. This is the journey of thousands of people to the Tree of Life, located in the afternoon of this town in the Potosí sector.\nIf you are going to participate in the tour this year, keep the following recommendations in mind:\nAvoid participating in the company of children under 5 years of age and pets. Maintain good hydration, sunscreen and clothing that covers well. The consumption of alcoholic beverages and psychoactive substances is prohibited. Follow the recommendations of the organizers within the framework of the event. Avoid separating from the main mobilization. Do not throw any type of garbage during the procession or on the grounds of the Tree of Life. Inform the authorities of any risky or special situation. Here, a post with more information and recommendations from the Local Mayor’s Office of Ciudad Bolívar about the Way of the Cross to the Tree of Life, this Friday, March 29, 2024:\nAccording to estimates from the ecclesiastical authority of Colombia, it is expected that the traditional Stations of the Cross in town 19 will become the largest in the entire city above the best-known ones in the capital district such as those in Barrio 20 de Julio and Monserrate.\nDue to the above, the district authorities have established a Unified Command Post (PMU) to guarantee security and carry out preventive measures. This event will be accompanied by volunteers from the Red Cross, the Colombian Civil Defense, two ambulances, human rights managers and the Local Mayor’s Office of Ciudad Bolívar.\nTo guarantee surveillance and security, there will be support from the National Police, the National Army, security and coexistence managers from the District Security Secretariat, managers from the local mayor’s office, Community Police and Tourism Police.\nLikewise, the Ministry of Mobility and the Traffic Police will be in charge of road closures and detours for this Good Friday in the Santa Viviana, Potosí, Caracolí and Arborizadora Alta neighborhoods. The SITP routes and other public service vehicles will have adjustments to their routes during the pilgrimage.\nThe closures will begin at 7:00 am and will go until 2:00 pm from the Candelaria La Nueva neighborhood to the upper part of the town along Carrera 42 Avenue between Calle 68c Sur and Diagonal 81 Sur.\nBelow is a map with the closures during the day:\nIf you are interested in attending the Stations of the Cross this Friday, March 29, these are the stations:\nStart time 7:00 am\n1 Station:\n• Location Our Lady of Candelaria Parish (Cra 35 con calle 64)\n2 Station:\n• Place Cl. 68c South #41-5 to 41-1\n3 Station:\n• Lugar Cra. 38 #69g Sur-19 to 69g Sur-49\n4 Station:\n• Location CL 69D South – KR 39\n5 Station:\n• Lugar Cl. 69m Sur #44a-2 a 44a-44\n6 Station:\n• Lugar Cra. 42 #69n Sur-45 to 69n Sur-81\n7 Station:\n• Place Cra. 42 #71 Sur-1 to 71 Sur-69\n8 Station:\n• Lugar Cra. 42 #72b Sur-14 to 72b Sur-10\n9 Station:\n• Location Cra. 42 #73b South-88 to 73b South-2\n10 Station:\n• Location Cl. 75b South #42 to 41\n11 Station:\n• Place Cl. 78a South #38-2 at 38-94\n12 Station:\n• TV Place. 37 #79 South-3 to 79 South-67\n13 Station:\n• Lugar Tv. 37 #78b Sur-42 to 78b Sur-2\n14 Station:\n• Place of the hanged man or Tree of Life .",

    "text": "Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Jelani Splawn / Spotlight PA Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Jelani Splawn / Spotlight PA Pennsylvania’s 2023 labor market is closing the year off strong, with a record-low unemployment rate of 3.4 percent in November, which is the [most recent data available](https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/labor-and-industry-details.aspx?newsid=816). That’s down one percent from the same time last year. Scott Meckley, deputy director for the Center for Workforce Information and Analysis at the Department of Labor, said 10 out of the 11 groups of industries they follow have seen job growth. Education and health services, professional and business services and leisure and hospitality have seen the most growth, while manufacturing has declined slightly. Meckley said this market is especially good for job-seekers, because employers are looking to hire from a smaller pool of candidates, and they’re willing to offer extra motivation to get workers. “If you have the skills and the education that employers are looking for, it’s a buyers market because employers have to compete with other companies,” Meckley said. “It’s not as simple as putting a help wanted sign in the window — it’s offering higher wages, it’s offering other incentives like benefits or teleworking toptions, and daycare and transportation.” A healthy economy typically maintains an unemployment rate between 3 and 5 percent, so the unemployment rate likely won’t see the continual downward trend Pennsylvanians have grown accustomed to over the past three years. “I don’t know if a lower unemployment rate, or too much lower than where we are, is realistic,” Meckley said. “But staying around where we are or staying around where we are nationally is certainly what we’re hoping for and we’d be surprised if we weren’t doing that.” December’s employment numbers will come out in the middle of January, at which point the Department of Labor will begin a final report on the labor market throughout the year. The final year-long report will be more accurate than the estimated unemployment rates that are released monthly, according to Meckley. “When we get to the end of the year and we talk about how Pennsylvania did, we always throw that caveat out there that in another two months, we’re really going to know how we did,” he said. Meckley anticipates the final report will be released in March, at which point the department will be able to definitively compare 2023 to previous years.",

L’appuntamento è per venerdì 13 e sabato 14 settembre a Bruxelles (Belgio), dove il Memorial Van Damme farà calare il sipario sulla grande stagione della Regina degli Sport. Altri azzurri potrebbero aggiungersi agli atti conclusivi in caso di eventuali rinunce da parte di atleti che hanno guadagnato il pass sul campo.\nGianmarco Tamberi potrà andare a caccia del terzo diamantone della carriera dopo quelli conquistati nel 2021 e nel 2022: il Campione del Mondo di salto in alto cercherà di piazzare una stoccata in coda a una stagione in cui è riuscito a laurearsi Campione d’Europa, ma che purtroppo ha portato in dote anche la colica renale che gli ha impedito di essere grande protagonista alle Olimpiadi di Parigi 2024. Leonardo Fabbri cercherà di dire la sua nel getto del peso, da Campione d’Europa e vice campione mondiale reduce da tre podi consecutivi dopo la delusione maturata ai Giochi.\nMattia Furlani si è qualificato per le finali grazie al quinto posto ottenuto nella tappa di Zurigo e così il bronzo olimpico potrà puntare a un bel risultato nel salto in lungo, specialità in cui dovremmo vedere all’opera anche Larissa Iapichino (se la toscana deciderà di tornare in gara, non è più scesa in pedana dopo i Giochi chiusi a un soffio dal podio). Completerà il quadro Ayomide Folorunso sui 400 ostacoli, a chiudere una stagione meno brillante rispetto alle aspettative.\nITALIANI ALLE FINALI DI DIAMOND LEAGUE\nSALTO IN ALTO (MASCHILE): Gianmarco Tamberi.\nGETTO DEL PESO (MASCHILE): Leonardo Fabbri.\nSALTO IN LUNGO (MASCHILE): Mattia Furlani.\nSALTO IN LUNGO (FEMMINILE): Larissa Iapichino.\n400 OSTACOLI (FEMMINILE): Ayomide Folorunso.\nPer scoprire quote, pronostici, bonus, recensioni bookmaker su",

    "text": "An unusually strong solar storm headed toward Earth could produce northern lights in the U.S. this weekend and potentially disrupt power and communications.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare geomagnetic storm watch—the first in nearly 20 years. That was expected to become a warning Friday night, when the effects of the solar outburst were due to reach Earth.NOAA already has alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit to take precautions.\"As far as the worst situation expected here at Earth, that's tough to say and I wouldn't want to speculate on that,\" said NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl. \"However, severe level is pretty extraordinary, It's a very rare event to happen.\"NOAA said the sun produced strong solar flares beginning Wednesday, resulting in five outbursts of plasma capable of disrupting satellites in orbit and power grids here on Earth. Each eruption—known as a coronal mass ejection —can contain billions of tons of plasma and magnetic field from the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona.The flares seem to be associated with a sunspot that's 16 times the diameter of Earth, according to NOAA. An extreme geomagnetic storm in 2003 took out power in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa.The latest storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, according to NOAA.The most intense solar storm in recorded history, in 1859, prompted auroras in central America and possibly even Hawaii. \"That's an extreme-level event,\" Dahl said. \"We are not anticipating that\" but it could come close.",
