    "text": "We’re involved in a war in Ukraine and in Israel, getting hit regularly (100 times) with Houthi missiles and drones in the Red Sea. Now warmongering Graham wants us to blow up Iran. Basically, Iran did declare war on the US, using satellite terrorists. We need to sanction them into near-nonexistence again, not go to war. Graham thinks the initial step is always war.\n“For centuries, American statesmen reviled the thought of civilian deaths & war as a last resort,” Vivek Ramaswamy\nposted on X. “Now we have the likes of Lindsey Graham and Nikki Haley giddy about “blowing Iran off the map.” This is disgusting & says a lot about the kind of GOP they’re trying to resuscitate.”\nIt’s unlikely Graham can handle anything without demanding war. He’s a big part of our involvement in Ukraine. Graham and McConnell are now questioning sending money to Ukraine, so you know the war they wanted isn’t going well.\nLindsey needs to shut up before he starts World War III.\nNEW – Lindsey Graham: “Hit Iran… blow it off the map.”\n[pic.twitter.com/5dfhVQOcja]\n— Disclose.tv (@disclosetv)\n[December 28, 2023]",

    "title": "La Fe identifica alteraciones genéticas en EERR gracias a una técnica avanzada de análisis del ADN",
    "text": "La Unidad de Genética del Hospital Universitario y Politécnico La Fe ha realizado un estudio empleando la novedosa técnica del mapeo óptico del genoma (OGM por sus siglas en inglés) para el diagnóstico de enfermedades raras. En colaboración con el grupo de Investigación Traslacional en Genética y el grupo de Investigación en Hematología del Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria La Fe (IIS La Fe) se ha diagnosticado, gracias a la efectividad de esta técnica , a dos pacientes con enfermedades raras cuya causa genética estaba pendiente de resolver.\nEl mapeo óptico del genoma (OGM) es una técnica avanzada que permite visualizar y analizar la estructura completa del ADN en alta resolución , proporcionando una forma más precisa de detectar alteraciones en el genoma. A diferencia de otros métodos, el OGM identifica y cuenta directamente las moléculas de ADN, lo que mejora la precisión en la detección de errores estructurales. Se trata de un técnica que requiere equipamiento y personal especializado.\nEl equipo de La Fe analizó a dos pacientes con enfermedades raras sin diagnóstico genético previo . Uno de ellos presentaba una disrupción en el gen BCL11A, asociado con el síndrome de Dias-Logan, una enfermedad rara que provoca discapacidad intelectual, retraso en el desarrollo del lenguaje y rasgos físicos característicos, como la microcefalia. El otro tenía una deleción en mosaico de 682 kb en una región cercana al gen IHH, lo que afecta a su regulación e interfiere en el desarrollo óseo dando lugar al síndrome acrocalloso, un trastorno genético raro caracterizado por anomalías en el desarrollo de la estructura que conecta los dos hemisferios cerebrales.\nEl estudio, cuya autora es Carmen Orellana , resalta la importancia y utilidad del OGM para detectar y analizar enfermedades raras. Dentro del espectro de las enfermedades raras, los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y los síndromes polimalformativos son patologías cuyo diagnóstico es difícil a pesar de utilizar las actuales técnicas de análisis genético de alto rendimiento como el array genómico y la secuenciación masiva.\nEnfermedades raras y OGM Algunas variantes genéticas escapan al análisis de las técnicas convencionales. Las variantes genéticas estructurales, en particular, a menudo escapan a la detección. En cambio, el OGM es un sistema más preciso capaz de identificar variantes .\nEl OGM funciona como un escáner avanzado del ADN . Imaginemos que el genoma es un libro de instrucciones para el cuerpo humano. Las técnicas de diagnóstico genético convencionales pueden detectar errores en letras (variantes puntuales), en palabras o frases que se repiten o se pierden (inserciones-deleciones), pero si hay páginas desordenadas (variantes estructurales), estas técnicas no lo ven. El OGM, en cambio, actúa como un escáner avanzado que permite ver el libro completo y detectar estos errores estructurales.",

    "text": "MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — After a tragedy last summer, there has been a push to bring lifesaving devices to parks in Martin County. Now, we've learned that automated external defibrillators (AEDs) will be in place in the coming weeks.\nWhat happened on the pickleball courts at Halpatiokee Park in Stuart last July shook Candace Cooney.\n\"Unfortunately he passed away right here on the courts in front of 50 other pickleball players,\" said Cooney.\nShe was there when 56-year-old Sam Hopkins collapsed.\nPlayers called an ambulance and rushed to perform CPR but Hopkins died.\nWPTV Candace Cooney speaks about the push to get AEDS in place at parks in Martin County. After the tragedy, more than 120 pickleball players raised enough money to buy three AEDs, and someone was responsible for bringing them to the park each day.\n\"It was important to us that that wasn’t the end of it,\" Cooney said. \"We'll never know if that would have helped Sam or not, but we didn't want to find ourselves in that position again.\"\nSince players were responsible for bringing the AEDs, they were not available all the time, so Cooney and others began asking county commissioners to get them placed in parks permanently.\n\"We thought it would be a no-brainer,\" Cooney said. \"We've had an unfortunate situation, and we need to do something now.\"\nWPTV Deputy Chief Rodney Robertson with Martin County Fire Rescue speaks about how the AEDs will be implemented. After months of dialogue, the AEDs are now on their way.\n\"We know that when we use CPR along with an AED within the first minute or two, the person's chance for survival greatly increases,\" Deputy Chief Rodney Robertson with Martin County Fire Rescue said.\nMartin County Fire Rescue will oversee the new devices.\n\"The county has authorized the purchase of about 40 of those,\" Robertson said. \"We’re going to put them in various locations throughout the county in different parks. They will not be in every park but in selected parks.\"\nThey'll have GPS monitors, so first responders will know if they’ve been used or when they have a low battery.\nThe devices will be in cases to withstand the elements and can be opened with a code when someone calls 911.\nCooney is relieved that change is coming and grateful that WPTV gave her a platform.\n\"Your eyes on this issue is what raised the profile and really started something, the wheels turning and something taking place and I'm so appreciative of that,\" Cooney said.\nThe exact locations of the AEDs within the parks are still being determined. Martin County Fire Rescue plans to roll them out in the coming weeks.",

    "text": "In high school athletics, a handful of years can seem like an eternity — especially in soccer.\nFrom 2015-2022, the Elyria Catholic boys soccer program had one nine-win season, and each season ended with a losing record and at least 11 or 12 losses (minus a 3-8-3 showing in 2017).\nFrom 2005 to 2014, the Panthers had a winning record almost every year, with a .500 showing of 7-7-2 in 2009 the least successful season over those 10 years, with multiple 15-plus win seasons. Elyria Catholic qualified for the regional round six times and a handful of district rounds, losing heartbreakers by one or two goals.\nFollowing 10 years of excellence and eight years of futility, Elyria Catholic second-year head coach Tony Csiszar has turned the program around. Even after being bounced in a sectional final by then-conference rival Rocky River last October, the Panthers posted a 10-7-0 record in 2023. They are 3-1-0 in 2024 through Sept. 3.\n“We have a lot of seniors, so it’s an older team,” Csiszar said of the team’s early confidence following a Sept. 3 win over Benedictine and on potential struggles ahead.\n“They have egos, and that makes it challenging,” Csiszar smiled. “Just trying to get everybody’s mindset right at halftime and remind them ‘Hey everybody, it’s all about the team.’ It’s always family here and I try to teach these kids that it’s a family when you trust each other and treat each other well, good things happen. This team will continue to shine in every moment if they continue to do that.”\nSenior captain Cole Varndell has seen the change, including how the team distributed the ball when fellow captain and scoring machine Hezekiah Garcia had extra coverage. He scored two goals against the Bengals and the team has followed up a good 2023 with a solid 2024 so far.\nElyria Catholic’s Cole Varndell is congratulated by his teammates after a first-half goal against Benedictine on Sept. 3. (Randy Meyers – for The Morning Journal) “Hezekiah is a very good player,” Varndell said. “When they make him unavailable, it creates those opportunities for me and the others. It’s helping our team get goals and win the game in front of us.”\nNelson Perez — a junior starter who didn’t join the Panthers’ soccer side until last year — was another beneficiary of how Csiszar has turned the program’s star upward and developed a strong team bond. While he wasn’t on the 2022 team, he experienced the highs of last fall and how Csiszar has brought the team together.\n“Tony has been pushing us so much in practice. He makes us run out there,” Perez grinned while containing a chuckle. “It’s incredible! It’s good how our team has the strong character of not giving up — even through the toughest times. We might think ‘We can’t do this anymore’, but we keep pushing because we want the results and we want to win.”\nThe culture instilled by Csiszar is contagious in the best way possible to get all the players to buy in, an assessment Perez couldn’t agree more with.\n“It creates a different environment and also creates a different game play,” Perez said. “How the ball moves and how it all starts and finishes. It’s not going to be easy — this season is going to be tough. But we’re going to fight through it and keep going no matter what.\n“We might be in the biggest slump, but we’re not going to give up. We won’t throw our hands up walk away. We’re going to keep fighting until we get what we want, and we’re going to go all the way.”",
