    "text": "Mongolia becomes the latest country to enter the global space industry with the launch of its first satellites today, ushering in new era of innovation and investment for the nation’s burgeoning tech sector. Two low-earth-orbit nano satellites were [successfully launched into space](/startups/14-exciting-spacetech-startups-2024/) aboard Space-X’s Falcon-9 rocket from the company’s Vandenberg Space Force Base launch site in California on 4th March 2023. The Cubesat satellites, named Ondosat-Owl-1 and Ondosat-Owl-2, were built by Mongolian company Ondo Space and successfully completed rigorous space environmental testing at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan. The Government of Mongolia has also announced it will establish a ‘space sandbox’ to support the continued growth of the domestic space sector. This comprehensive new framework will provide regulatory and policy support for companies to conduct testing and R&D in Mongolia while making use of the country’s newly enhanced connectivity and competitive talent pool. The dual satellite network and space sandbox will position Mongolia as a high-value investment and research destination for global companies across the space and technology sectors. Prime Minister of Mongolia, L. Oyun-Erdene, commented: “Mongolia’s historic achievement in sending a man to space in 1981 laid the foundation for today’s momentous occasion, showcasing the swift advancement of our domestic space endeavours. This milestone marks just the beginning of our journey towards cultivating a vibrant domestic space industry.

Introducing a regulatory ‘sandbox’ within a comprehensive legislative framework aimed at facilitating the business landscape for cutting-edge technologies will ensure that the government actively fosters ongoing growth and innovation across key domains such as the space economy, artificial intelligence, iOT, and other emerging technologies. Leveraging its amicable relations with key stakeholders in the space economy, Mongolia also aims to cultivate its talent pool to strengthen its position in the global landscape.” Ondo Space Founder and President, Mr. Anar Chinbaatar, commented: “We are thrilled to be part of this historic moment for the country as we launch our first ever Mongolian satellite into orbit. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, as well as the support of the Mongolian government in advancing our capabilities in space technology. The Mongolian Government is also currently in discussions with SpaceX to explore options to launch the first country’s first high-orbit national satellite, currently under construction by French company Thales Alenia Space, is the latest milestone in the Mongolian Government’s ambitious and wide-ranging programme to develop a domestic space economy. Enabling digital transformation across Mongolia is one of the central pillars of the Government’s Vision 2050 and New Recovery Policy. It continues strengthening partnerships with G7 countries to [explore space-related cooperation opportunities](/tech/role-of-pr-space-tech/) for peaceful purposes.",

    "text": "Infinity Studio is a Shanghai-based company that specializes in hyper-realistic silicone statues and busts based on popular movie, cartoon and video characters.\nThere are plenty of studios producing high-quality silicone collectibles, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find one better than Infinity Studio. Founded in 2014 in Shanghai, China, the company quickly established itself as the go-to source for the most realistic-looking statues and busts of pop-culture characters, securing licenses for popular franchises like Dragon Ball, Batman, Wonder Woman, Predator, as well as Chinese culture classics like Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Although some of its most impressive works sell for thousands of dollars, you really get what you pay for!\nUsing only the highest-quality silicone, like platinum silicone and medical-grade silicone, Infinity Studio artisans can replicate even the tiniest facial details on their works of art, down to droplets of sweat and even skin pores. Hair strands are inserted manually, which takes hours of work, but the end result is nothing short of awe-inspiring.\nWe only learned about Infinity Studio’s incredible silicone statues a few days ago, while browsing on Reddit. We saw this gorgeous bust of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman that seemed too realistic to be true. A bit of research sent us down a rabbit hole full of incredible silicone creations, including ultra-realistic statues of Christian Bale’s Batman, Henry Cavill’s Superman, Bruce Lee, and many more.\n﻿",

    "text": "On OAN, Heritage Foundation guest touts Alabama ruling against IVF: “An unqualified win” OAN host on decision: “It's bringing back ethics and humanity, I think, to this conversation surrounding IVF” Written by Media Matters Staff Published 02/22/24 2:06 PM EST Video file Citation From the February 21, 2024, edition of OAN's Tipping Point with Kara McKinney KARA MCKINNEY (HOST): Since we are talking about the youth and children and young people and what we're doing to them, of course, it all begins with conception, right? This is something you and I have talked about at great lengths, IVF and all things related to surrogacy. Well, now in Alabama, a big new ruling came out from their Supreme Court seeing that frozen embryos now can be ruled as children when it comes to court cases, specifically under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. And this all comes down to the year 2020. A patient was at a IVF center, and they were trying to receive some vials of embryos that were frozen and in the process, they accidentally killed a few embryos of several couples. Those couples then tried to sue them. The judge at the time said no standing because these are not actually children. The Supreme Court comes in and says, actually, these can be seen as children under the law. What are your thoughts on these updates? EMMA WATERS (HERITAGE FOUNDATION): Yeah, this is an unqualified win for those who believe that the personhood of embryonic children, not a financially driven fertility industry should be the primary concern in in-vitro fertilization. This ruling, as you mentioned, is a natural extension of Alabama's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act and simply takes their ruling on the sanctity of human life and applies that to unborn human life and even human life that was created through in-vitro fertilization. And so as the case details, this is not the addition of a new kind of thinking in Alabama state law. It's an extension of the laws that they already had in place. It does not actually limit access to in-vitro fertilization itself, but it does say that if we are to practice the creation of human life outside of the womb, then we should apply the best possible standards of care that place the well-being of the child front and center to that. So, there's been a lot of people who have claimed that this now going to take away IVF. One clinic has actually suspended in-vitro fertilization treatments for the time being until they understand the implications of this ruling, and all this tells you is that the fertility clinics who claim to be there in order to help you achieve your goal of having a child have not been applying the best possible standard of care. It means that they're concerned that something in their treatment, either through the willful destruction of embryonic human life, which we know is rife throughout the whole IVF industry, or perhaps just through negligence of not properly securing the area, not storing embryos in the best condition, not ensuring that they're being implanted at the best possible time, they can now actually be held accountable to this. And before people say that this seems bizarre and out of line, these are the exact same standards that are applied to every aspect of the medical industry because ultimately the most important person here is not the fertility clinic, it's not the financial incentive that they have to create as many embryos as possible with little concern for how those embryos are treated, but it is the well-being of the child itself. And of course, keeping in mind the parents here, who in the original ruling they suffered the unimaginable loss of the death of those embryos that they hoped would one day be their children. So I think, really, just keeping in mind that this is a case that is responding to this deeply painful loss and is doing the best it can to provide those protections for children. MCKINNEY: You know it's bringing back ethics and humanity, I think, to this conversation surrounding IVF.",

    "text": "[] 5 Must-Have Tools Firefighters Should Carry On Every Call [](https://www.atoallinks.com/author/elanthomas767/) [elanthomas767](https://www.atoallinks.com/author/elanthomas767/), [7 mins ago](https://www.atoallinks.com/2024/5-must-have-tools-firefighters-should-carry-on-every-call/)5 min read 5 Firefighting is not a job for faint-hearted individuals or those who cannot work for extended periods without rest. Different issues will always come up with every call, and the firefighters have to be well-prepared with the right equipment. From the line-cutting option to the administration of post-accident first aid, the firefighter equipment available is life-determining. Here are five tools that are always suggested that every firefighter should have on every call, regardless of the run. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) The Foundation of Firefighter Safety Independent of the level of protection, personal protective equipment, or PPE, is the key to a fighter’s safety. These are helmets, gloves, boots, bunker gear, and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). All these [firefighter products](https://www.line2ems.com/collections/firefighter-supplies) aim to safeguard the firefighters from the numerous dangers likely to be encountered at the operation scene. - Helmets: Contemporary firefighting helmets are engineered to protect themselves by resisting heat and offering protection from blows. They usually feature incorporated accessories such as visors or face shields for protection against various spatter and heat. - Gloves: These protective gears meet some important aspects, including offering thermal protection to the hands in the form of fire gloves. These gloves are equally comfortable to wear and ideal for operating equipment due to their flexibility. - Boots: Metal boots protect the feet from falling objects and sturdy, sharp items and ensure proper grip on slippery floors. - Turnout Gear: Turnout gear consists of a wearable piece covering the upper part of the body and another piece covering the pelvic area. It is heat-resistant and isolative, thus protecting firefighters from risky temperatures. - SCBA: The self-contained breathing apparatus is crucial for receiving clean air separately from smoke, thus avoiding the risk of smoke intake and enabling firefighters to work extended hours in dangerous conditions. Halligan Tool The Versatile Multi-Tool The Halligan firefighter tool kit refers to the tool identified as the Halligan bar. It is used for forcible entries, prying, twisting, and striking. The Halligan tool is a success story of the modern firefighter’s tool kit, invented by a New York City firefighter in the 1940s. - Adze End: The adze end is interesting for forcing doors and gates or opening windows and creating anchor points for the other tools. - Pick End: The pick end can be used to get through barriers such as doors and walls to create an access point for remaining manipulations. - Fork End: The fork end pries and operates in narrow spaces, effectively prying open locks or chains. Thermal Imaging Camera (TIC) Seeing Through the Smoke A thermal imaging camera (TIC) is one of the best firefighter tools. It is professional equipment that looks at heat and can turn heat into a picture. It is used to find victims and hot areas in the smoke. - Locating Victims: TICs assist the firefighters in providing lighting, hence seeing through thick smoke to find people who are trapped or possibly unconscious. - Identifying Hotspots: TICs have the capacity to detect heat, which is very helpful when it comes to sensing heat behind the walls or above the ceiling. This helps firefighters tackle concealed fires before they extend. - Assessing Structural Integrity: TICs give information about a structure’s stability, including temperatures that may distress it. Portable radio Communication is Key Communication during firefighting must also be considered, mainly because communication is essential when responding to this disaster. The two-way portable radios ensure the firefighters are in touch with each other and the various command headquarters. - Coordination: Radios allow the firefighters to communicate with one another and let them know what is going on and what everyone else is doing so that they can have a team goal and any kind of change to that plan. - Safety: Sometimes, it may take a while to make these calls due to different circumstances, but at least the firefighter can call for backup or evacuation within a very short period, hence improving his or her safety. - Information Relay: The information that would be crucial when fighting fires, building conditions, and people who need help can be immediately reported. First Aid Kit Lifesaving Medical Supplies This compilation of medicines and documents is crucial when responding to an emergency and treating injured victims and firefighters. The range of supplies in the kit may include bandages, burn dressings, CPR masks, and trauma shears. - Bandages and Dressings are effective for managing wound infections, bacterial infections, inflammation, and other conditions, such as burns. - CPR Masks are used to give resuscitation without directly touching the responder, minimizing the risk of infection transmission. - Trauma Shears: The scissors shave through cloth or debris and effectively gain quick access to the wound. - Burn Gel: for managing the observed burn injuries when other forms of treatment are inaccessible. Conclusion Firefighting is considered one of the herolike professions, which involves great risks and the need for skills to accomplish the mission. Another of the factors that experts suggest links firefighters’ equipment to their capacity to perform in emergencies, including the tools that firefighters haul along. The gloves or the mask used in the working environment represent the outer shell, which shields them from the environment and other hazards in the same way that the lenses and thermal imaging camera represent the inner mechanisms that enable them to capture the images or complete their task successfully. These tools not only increase the effectiveness of operations given to a firefighter to fight fires but also ensure that firefighters are in a position where they can continue with their heroic tasks while at the same time avoiding instances where they succumb to the danger posed by fire.",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| Thiruvananthapuram | Updated: 29-03-2024 17:59 IST | Created: 29-03-2024 17:59 IST - Country: - India In the wake of criticism from the Latin Catholic Archdiocese about lack of proper government intervention in violence against Christians in the country, Union Minister V Muraleedharan said here on Friday that religious minorities were not facing any threat in the country. Minister of State for External Affairs Muraleedharan, who is also the BJP-led NDA candidate from Attingal Lok Sabha constituency, said he has interacted a lot with senior priests of the church and has never got the feeling that they were concerned the Christian community was not safe in the country. The violence against Christians in the country, especially in Manipur, is being used by the Congress and the Left, during the LS poll campaign, to target the BJP which is striving to woo the Christian community in the southern state to end their electoral drought in Kerala. The BJP leader also claimed that even senior priests have said incidents of violence were not a religious issue, but a racial one. He was responding to queries from reporters at the BJP office here where it was announced that he would be filing his nomination on Saturday. It was also announced that the deposit amount of Rs 25,000, to be submitted along with the nomination, was being given by students who were rescued from Ukraine after the war with Russia broke out there. After the announcement, reporters pointed out that Latin Catholic metropolitan Archbishop Thomas J Netto in the morning said Christians in various parts of the country, especially in Manipur and north India, were being subjected to ''cruelty and violence by dark forces'' and alleged there was no effective intervention against it by government authorities. Muraleedharan said he cannot respond to it without hearing what the Archbishop said in its entirety. ''However, under the Narendra Modi government, religious minorities in India are not facing any threats. That is the reality,'' he contended.

    "text": "THUNDER BAY - After being without a contract for two years, corrections workers have received an arbitration award that union leaders say is a fair deal. “I think it represents the work we do and the inflation everybody faces,” said Shawn Bradshaw, president of OPSEU Local 708 with the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre. “I think it adds to recruitment and retention for qualified officers and the nurses also received an additional reward, so hopefully we can retain more nurses as well.” OPSEU [entered arbitration in late November](https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/contract-negotiations-for-corrections-workers-to-enter-arbitration-7873779) after collective bargaining negotiations with the province broke down primarily over wage increases. In early December, arbitrator William Kaplan released his arbitration reward that includes a 9.5 per cent general increase and a 10.5 per cent special increase for officers retroactively effective from January 2022 through to January 2024. Broken down, the increase works out to a 3 per cent increase in 2022, 3.5 per cent in 2023, and 3 per cent in 2024. “I think the arbitrator was very fair, keeping us in relative perspective with the federal system,” Bradshaw said. “It compares provincially. We are probably a leader now provincially, but we will need to start the negotiation process again right away because we worked two years without a contract. We will be looking to start the negotiation process probably late spring and start all over again.” Nursing staff also received a wage increase of 6.875 per cent retroactively effective January 2023 through to January 2024. Bradshaw believes the wage increases will make working in corrections more competitive with other public service agencies, primarily police services in the region, and will benefit recruitment and retainment efforts. “What we see in corrections is the market is very competitive, especially in Northern Ontario where there are several police forces, more services, other avenues,” Bradshaw said. “So we have to be competitive with those employers as well and traditionally we haven’t been and we would lose a lot of good staff and would have trouble recruiting them. I think this will positively address that.” OPSEU represents approximately 400 workers at various agencies in the city, including the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre and the Thunder Bay District Jail. The arbitration award is binding and legal and the members do not vote on it, but Bradshaw said there seems to be a consensus among the workers that the award is fair. “I think 10.5 is very fair and fair to the citizens of Ontario and the workers and accurately reflects the best you can in this market the inflation that everybody has to battle,” he said. Bradshaw noted that corrections staff in Ontario face some of the highest rates of violence and assaults provincially, and while the arbitration award does not deal specifically with health and safety issues, he said the Ministry is moving in the right direction. “The government seems to be moving towards a model of more programming to positively engage inmates and properly classify them,” Bradshaw said. “I think the Ministry is moving in the right direction overall.”",

    "text": "Commenter Réagir Envoyer par mail Envoyer Partager sur Facebook Partager Partager sur Twitter Twitter « Mais les femmes ont toujours eu la fonction de diaconesses sans être diacres, n’est-ce pas ? Les femmes sont d’un grand service en tant que femmes, pas en tant que ministres. » Au cours de l’entretien accordé à la télévision CBS et diffusé mardi 21 mai, le pape François a écarté l’hypothèse de l’ordination diaconale de femmes . Une annonce qui a surpris, mettant un terme aux réflexions engagées depuis plusieurs années.\nDernièrement retirée des sujets abordés par le Synode sur la synodalité, la question des femmes diacres avait été auparavant confiée à une commission ad hoc en 2016, bientôt dissoute pour faire place, en 2020, à une nouvelle commission d’étude sur le diaconat féminin qui n’a toujours pas achevé ses travaux. D’une phrase, face aux caméras, le pape François a mis un point final au sujet. « Je comprends mal cette précipitation, je suis surprise qu’il se prononce sans nécessité ni urgence, depuis le temps que la question est débattue », soupire Anne-Marie Pelletier (1), théologienne et membre de ladite commission.\nÀ lire aussi Le diaconat féminin évacué des débats du synode : « La justification est un peu grossière » « C’est vraiment dommage que la question soit réglée au détour d’une phrase, alors qu’elle mérite débat, délibération, discernement », a réagi le père Étienne Grieu, jésuite, recteur des Facultés Loyola Paris (ex-Centre Sèvres). Pour lui, le diaconat féminin ouvrait la possibilité d’un ministère ordonné pour les femmes ; alors que le pape opte plutôt pour une sorte d’entre-deux avec des « diaconesses », entendues comme des femmes au service, sans même préciser si elles relèveront d’un ministère institué, tel que lecteur ou acolyte.\n« En refusant le diaconat féminin ordonné, le pape ne fait que conforter la dissymétrie homme-femme dans l’Église, poursuit Anne-Marie Pelletier. C’est cantonner les femmes à distance de l’enclos sacerdotal. »\nÀ lire aussi Comment le pape François réfléchit à féminiser l’Église Le ministère ordonné reste donc exclusivement masculin, selon trois ordres : l’épiscopat, pour les évêques ; le presbytérat, pour les prêtres ; et le diaconat, pour les diacres . « Ordonnées, les femmes pourraient commenter la Parole de Dieu durant la liturgie, souligne encore Étienne Grieu (2). Nous pourrions entendre une voix féminine nous ouvrir l’Évangile. »\nAnne-Marie Pelletier insiste sur la place du « sacerdoce baptismal » qui est premier depuis Vatican II. Pour le pape, les femmes continueront à servir comme elles le font. Cela passera-t-il par la reconnaissance d’un ministère institué de diaconesse par simple bénédiction – en opposition à l’ordination ? Le pape ne l’a pas évoqué. « Pourquoi la diaconie de la Parole ou même certains gestes sacramentels ne seraient-ils pas assurés par des femmes ? », interroge encore Anne-Marie Pelletier.\nÀ lire aussi En vue du Synode, les évêques belges favorables au diaconat féminin Réagissant aux propos du pape, Anne Soupa , cofondatrice du Comité de la jupe, se dit pour sa part scandalisée : « C’est dénier aux femmes l’aptitude aux ordres sacrés, ce qui est intellectuellement intolérable. » Pour cette théologienne engagée, qui avait fondé beaucoup d’espoir en ce pape argentin (3) , de telles décisions vont accentuer le fossé avec la société civile : « Que serait la France aujourd’hui sans femmes députées, magistrates, policières, pour n’évoquer que des fonctions régaliennes ? »\nAccablée par l’entretien du pape à la télévision américaine, elle s’étonne qu’il ait, dans le même temps, imposé un quota de femmes électrices au synode. Plus largement, Anne Soupa se demande si, « au cœur des querelles de la Curie, la question des femmes est un marqueur au Vatican ».\nÀ lire aussi Pour l’Église, la femme est-elle une mère avant d’être une croyante ? Jusqu’à l’Antiquité tardive, la question des diaconesses n’était pas tranchée. Étaient-elles reconnues par une simple bénédiction ou par une ordination ? Selon le concile de Chalcédoine (451), il y avait une même ordination pour les diaconesses que pour les diacres.\n« La question n’est même pas de reproduire ce qui a pu exister, explique le père Étienne Grieu , mais de chercher de quoi l’Église a besoin aujourd’hui. » Pour le théologien, « ce n’est pas seulement une question d’experts. On pourrait y consacrer un synode, la question des femmes reconnues comme ministres ordonnées est très importante pour l’Église ».\nÀ lire aussi Quelle place pour les femmes dans l’Église ? Enfin, si les femmes ne peuvent accéder à l’ordre, ne serait-il pas envisageable de « réduire » le diaconat masculin à un ministère institué, à l’égal des diaconesses ? « Aucune évolution substantielle sur cette question comme sur d’autres ne pourra faire l’économie d’une réflexion en profondeur sur le sacrement de l’ordre. Tout en lui est-il intangible, fixé pour l’éternité ? » , interroge Mgr Jean-Paul Vesco , archevêque d’Alger, dans une tribune publiée par La Croix .\nAgacé par des pressions, le pape a-t-il précipitamment mis fin au débat ? Même si un extrait d’interview n’a pas une grande force théologique, la porte est maintenant fermée pour quelque temps. Tout en nécessitant un texte plus officiel, encore à venir.\n(1) L’Église et le Féminin, Anne-Marie Pelletier, Salvator, 2021, 170 p., 17,80 €.\n(2) Le Dieu qui ne compte pas.

    "title": "You Can Be Mad About The Price And Still Pre-Order A Switch 2",
    "text": "Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 went live in the United States last week, and it was about as messy as you might have expected. Despite outrage surrounding the Switch 2’s price and the fact that Nintendo has raised the cost of some of its games to $80, pre-orders still sold out instantly. I was lucky enough to be able to snag one (shoutout to Walmart, you had my back when the PS5 launched and you had it again, I’ll never forget that).\n“But, Peter,” I hear you writing in the comments, “You were mad about the increased price of Switch 2 games! How can you possibly justify encouraging Nintendo to keep doing what it’s doing by buying its hardware and games anyway?” That’s a reasonable reaction to have, given how vocal many people have been, myself included, about the ever-increasing price of games and gaming hardware. However, I think that response is well-intentioned, albeit a little misguided.\nBeing mad about how much the Switch 2 and its games cost is perfectly valid, but it’s also valid to buy them anyway.\nLet’s Be Clear: This Isn’t My Fault, This Isn’t Your Fault\nHave you ever seen that comic of the peasant saying, “We should improve society somewhat,” and then there’s a guy with a smug grin on his face saying, “Yet you participate in society, curious!”? That comic is how a lot of the conversations I’ve seen online about Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders feel.\nI am irritated that the cost of living has gone up drastically since I’ve become an adult. Every year, I have less and less spending money thanks to things like inflation and rent increases; and now, thanks to the tariffs the U.S. government has placed on foreign goods, prices have increased exponentially in just a few weeks. All of that makes my blood boil, but there’s not a single thing I can do to change that. I wish there was, but there isn’t.\nI have no control over how much video games cost, and, despite the legions of people out there saying to vote with your wallet, things don’t quite work like that in an industry controlled by three console manufacturers. There aren’t a plethora of options when it comes to buying gaming hardware; the only way you can ‘vote’ is to simply abstain from buying them.\nThe reality of the situation is that an unorganized consumer boycott against one of the biggest media companies in the world will simply not work, since the Switch 2 is guaranteed to be a success thanks to the runaway success of the original console.\nThe Full-Price Discount\nAnother unfortunate reality about the Switch 2’s price is that it is subject to change. In the fine print, console manufacturers are very open about the fact that they reserve the right to change console prices at any time. In the past, that meant that consoles would lower in price after a few years. Early adopters understood that they’d be paying premium prices to get their hands on the Switch or PS4 or whatever right at launch and that the price would gradually go down as we got closer to the next generation of consoles.\nNow, however, consoles have only gone up in price. Earlier this month, the PS5 saw a price increase in several markets, meaning that anyone who bought a console at launch actually got a better deal than those looking to pick one up now. As backward as it might sound, buying a Switch 2 at launch might be the best price that Nintendo offers for the console.\nIt’s Okay To Be Mad\nThat infuriates me. I was able to afford a Switch 2 pre-order because of my tax return, which, unexpectedly, covered most of the costs of the console and a copy of Mario Kart World. I am extremely fortunate that things worked out like that for me since, had it not been for my tax return, I would not have been able to afford it. The fact of the matter, however, is that I was able to afford the console and a game, but that’s not the case for everyone.\nI am upset that gaming has started to stray away from its accessibility by outpricing many of the people who rely on it for entertainment. I understand the business decisions that were made by Nintendo and how its pricing reflects those decisions, but I am still allowed to be mad about them.\nIf you want to play Nintendo games, there is no way to vote with your wallet in a way that Nintendo will notice. If playing Nintendo games is important to you, then you either have to pay for a Switch 2 or simply not engage with the company’s games at all. It is perfectly fine to buy a Switch 2 and be mad that it costs as much as it does, and may very well cost more at some point down the line. This is an invitation to be mad and stay mad until we see economic change, but this is also an invitation to play some video games in the meantime, even if they’re overpriced.\nNintendo Switch 2\n- Brand\n- Nintendo\n- Operating System\n- Proprietary\n- Storage\n- 256GB internal / MicroSD\n- Resolution\n- 1080p (handheld) / 4K (docked)",
