    "title": "Democratic Party Chairman AHY Highlights Success of SBY Era Defense Program Continued by Jokowi",
    "text": "Jakarta –\nChairman of the Democratic Party Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (\nME) talked about the success of the Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) era defense program. He said that this success was continued by President Joko Widodo (Jokowi).\n“The commitment and what the Democratic Party wants to fight for is not just a promise, but we have provided evidence. Especially during the 10 year era of President SBY’s administration,” said AHY in his political speech in Yogyakarta, Friday (19/1/2024).\nAccording to AHY, the government in the Father’s era had sufficient fiscal space so that it could modernize the main weapons system (alutsista). SBY’s government is considered capable of diplomacy with other countries in order to sell modern defense systems.\n“With the diplomacy that we carry out, we can also convince a number of selling countries that\nIndonesia is capable and worthy of using this advanced weapon system. We are also able to gain trust that the modern defense equipment will not be misused,” said AHY.\n“Because, quite a few countries have money, but the producing countries don’t trust them to have high-tech defense equipment,” he said.\nAHY assessed that this success was continued by President Jokowi as president after SBY. Thus,\nIndonesia’s defense equipment continues to be modernized.\n“We are grateful that President Jokowi’s government is also continuing to procure defense equipment and modernize our defense forces. We believe that the government in the next five years will also continue to build our defense forces,” he said.\nNot only the Alutsista modernization program, SBY is also considered successful in contributing to maintaining\nworld peace. President Jokowi continued this success.\n“\nIndonesia has succeeded in becoming a major contributor to world peacekeeping forces. Thank God, this achievement has also been continued by President Jokowi’s government,” he said.\n“In a\nworld peace mission, in 2006, I also carried out state duties as part of the Garuda troops on the border of Lebanon and Israel,” he said.\n(aik/aud)\n2024-01-19 17:26:22\n#AHY #Values #Jokowi #Continuing #Success #SBYs #Defense #Policy",

    "title": "Honda is an indispensable Japanese car brand when discussing 'technology'.Honda founder Soichiro Hon.. - MK",
    "text": "Honda is an indispensable Japanese car brand when discussing 'technology'.\nHonda founder Soichiro Honda took technology before management. Rather than maximizing profits, we strengthened technology competitiveness by investing profits in technology development.\nThe strategy of prioritizing technology over profit has established itself as a successful car brand in the United States, the world's largest car brand battleground.\nIt has also jumped into motorsports such as Formula 1, Cart Race, and Indy 500, which are expensive to develop technology. Because of this effort, it was called the Honda of Technology, not just Honda.\nHonda is also famous for spending more money on things that are invisible. Rather than the appearance where you can see the difference at a glance, it is more important to improve the invisible inside.\nThis is because 改, the core of the Japanese manufacturing tradition and craftsmanship represented by \"Monozukuri,\" is considered important.\nAs a result, Honda cars are considered to be durable and less upset with quality. There is even a saying that the boredom leads to irritation and changes because you ride it for too long without breaking down.\nHonda Korea (CEO Lee Ji-hong) is evaluated for excellent service quality. It is among the top imported car brands in the service satisfaction sector.\nHonda Korea also introduced a monitoring system in 2019 in which customers directly evaluate their services without praising themselves for their excellent service quality.\nThe Honda Customer Satisfaction Assessment Team monitors and evaluates all service policies and processes at the customer contact point by visiting the official service center in person. Honda Korea and its customers aimed to grow together as one partner.\nDomestic consumers who are not yet interested in two-wheeled vehicles (motorcycles) due to their runaway and reckless images are not familiar, but Honda's brand influence in the motorcycle field is powerful.\nIt can be seen clearly through the \"2025 Korean Industry's Brand Power (K-BPI)\" organized by the Korea Efficiency Association Consulting (KMAC).\nHonda has topped the motorcycle category for a whopping 23 years. It's not the last 2023, it's been 23 years in a row.\nThe \"Brand Power of the Korean Industry\" is indexed by surveying 12,800 general consumers for brand awareness and loyalty. It has been in effect since 1999 and has been used as a representative indicator of domestic brand competitiveness evaluation.\nHonda Motorcycle topped the list for the 23rd consecutive year, scoring the highest score in five of six items related to brand awareness and loyalty among the \"2025 K-BPI\" evaluation items.\nThere's a secret. This is because it does not just sell a lot of good products at a reasonable price, but also strives to improve the quality and safety of after-sales service.\nHonda holds an annual skill contest to determine the best maintenance technicians in motorcycle services.\nHonda Korea introduced it for the first time in the industry in 2006 to improve technology service expertise and ultimately improve customer service quality.\nHonda is also a brand that is serious about motorcycle safety.\nUnlike cars that are blocked everywhere and protect drivers with airbags and seat belts, small mistakes endanger lives when driving motorcycles that lack safety. It threatens the lives of the driver as well as others.\nHonda has set a goal of achieving \"zero\" traffic crash deaths related to Honda vehicles and motorcycles worldwide by 2050. The primary goal is to halve the number of deaths by 2030.\nTo this end, Honda of Technology is developing safety technology that can protect not only vehicle drivers, but also motorcycles, bicycle drivers, and pedestrians.\nRegarding motorcycle safety, we developed riding simulators and trainers, front and rear interlocking brakes, and airbag systems.\nWe are actively conducting safety education as well as technology. Honda Korea is also fostering instructors in charge of safety education with the support of the headquarters.\nFurthermore, this year, we opened the Honda Education Center, a specialized motorcycle safety education institution for the first time as a domestic imported car brand.\nThis is because few drivers in Korea ride motorcycles after receiving proper safety training. In fact, there's a saying that if you ride a motorcycle, you have to pack your rice and follow it around to dry it.\nHonda Korea has set a policy to provide correct, safe and enjoyable motorcycle riding education through the Honda Education Center, prevent accidents, and expand mature safety awareness and the base of motorcycle culture.\nThe Honda Education Center, which opened in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province, as the largest in Korea, has been certified as a certified academy facility that provides safe driving education.\nIt has access to arrive within an hour from Seoul and other metropolitan areas. The total area is about 2,400 pyeong, including 1,200 pyeong of outdoor education center and 550 pyeong of two-story building, which is the largest motorcycle safe driving education facility in Korea.\nHonda Education Center is led by four experienced Korean instructors who have completed and obtained relevant qualifications for the Honda Safe Driving Leader Training in Japan.\nBased on Global Honda's proven training curriculum, we provide step-by-step systematic training.\nHonda is also holding \"Honda Day\" to increase customer loyalty as well as to spread the car and motorcycle culture enjoyed by all families.\nStarting with Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do in 2022, it is being held in Chuncheon, Gangwon-do, Gyeongju, and Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do.\nMore than 1,200 people participated in the \"2024 Honda Day at Gyeongcheon Island\" held in October last year, making it a representative domestic customer contact event for Honda.\nThis year, \"2025 Honda Day at Motor Arena\" was held at Belfore Moto Arena (based in Jeungpyeong-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do) on the 29th of last month.\nThis year's event was held under the concept of a 'bazaar' (a meeting of bikes and cars). The enthusiasm for participation was even hotter than in previous years.\nAll 1,300 people were filled within an hour of the pre-registration of the event. Family members of the participants and motorcycle drivers who could not apply for the event also visited the event.\nThe spring cold and late snowstorms poured in, but the enthusiasm of the participants who came from all over the country as well as from Japan was hot.\nHonda Korea, which was considering whether to hold Honda Day due to the recent disaster-level forest fire damage in Gyeongsang-do, participated in the pain by donating 100 million won to relief and recovery activities in forest fire-affected areas.\nDonations raised by funds, including the entire Honda Day participation fee, will be used to restore the affected site, provide emergency relief for victims, provide daily necessities, and support for daily recovery.

    "title": "It's been a summer filled with emotions for late model driver Tucker Pederson",
    "text": "The driver from East Grand Forks lost his mother, Julie, to cancer this spring. GRAND FORKS — Last summer, Tucker Pederson traveled the region, chasing a national points title in street stocks. But he wasn't by himself. His mother, Julie, made sure to be with him, even though she was battling metastatic breast cancer. \"Things were hard for her,\" Tucker said. \"But she still made it a point to come to every race, even if she was driving five or six hours. She didn't care. She said she was coming. She was big on keeping racing a family thing.\" It has been for the Pedersons. ADVERTISEMENT Julie was a pioneering driver, one of the first females to compete at River Cities Speedway. She drove the No. 93 super stock in the 1990s. Her husband, Joey, is one of the region's top late model drivers. Both of her children, Tucker and Kelsi, jumped into racing at young ages, too. Last year, Joey, Tucker and Kelsi all competed in different classes. \"It's hard when you get split up,\" Tucker said. \"My dad would be racing in Grand Forks and I'd be in Aberdeen. But my mom made an effort to make sure nobody was alone.\" Julie's health declined over the winter. On April 14, she died at age 49. \"This entire year has been very different without her,\" Tucker said. Memories of Julie are ever-present. Kelsi is driving the No. 93 lightning sprint car, using the same number as her mother. Tucker, meanwhile, decided to make the jump to late models and race with his dad. ADVERTISEMENT Tucker's late model is filled with tributes to his mom. The dominant color is pink. The side is lined with her pictures. \"I wanted to show support for her,\" said Tucker, who enlisted Fargo's Cole Babcock to help with the design. A new class Prior to this spring, Tucker had only completed two laps in a late model. But he and 10 other drivers scheduled a spring practice session at Devils Lake Speedway, where he drove about 80 laps. \"My first impressions were. . . that I was very skeptical (of driving a late model), because I was struggling a lot,\" Tucker said. \"I had gotten to the point in the street stock where I was comfortable wherever we raced it. But I struggled a lot with the late model in the beginning. \"The cars are faster. They're much more aggressive in terms of the g-forces you experience going through the corners. It was so much more aggressive than what I thought. My dad had warned me. After my first time out there, my arms felt like puddles.\" Tucker stuck with it. ADVERTISEMENT His first race came on May 10th at River Cities Speedway. It was an emotional night as the track paid tribute to Julie. Drivers gathered on Turn 2 as Joey, Tucker and Kelsi made laps. \"That was really cool,\" Tucker said. Tucker finished 12th in his first late model feature. He quickly improved. About a month later, on June 15, he won his first late model feature in Devils Lake. \"With that being my first win since my mom passed, it was an emotional one,\" Tucker said. \"Any and all feelings you can have hit at once. It was really exciting, but it was hard, too. I had to let it sink in afterwards. It was bittersweet. Everything circles in your mind. \"As much as it's exciting and new, you're reminiscing about the old.\" Tucker has gone on to have a strong summer. ADVERTISEMENT He's grabbed four top-five finishes and seven top-10s. \"Every night is a new learning curve,\" he said. Tucker plans to be back at River Cities Speedway at 7 p.m. Friday for Big Motor Mania. The show will include sprints, late models, A-Modifieds and non-wing sprints. The A-Modifieds will hold double features. It will be the first appearance at The Bullring for the late models since July 12. Tucker will look to run another memorable race. He'll have loved ones on his mind and tributes to them on his car. \"I have photos of my mom all over the side of my car,\" Tucker said. \"I have a tribute to my grandpa and great grandma, who passed away. I have a sticker for Bruce Hart. He was a big supporter of mine who passed away. \"The whole racing community has lost so much this year. It feels like everything is bittersweet. You have your high moments, but it's hard not to reminisce.\" ADVERTISEMENT Big Motor Mania When: 7 p.m. Friday (hot laps 6:30). Where: River Cities Speedway. Classes: Sprints, late models, A-Modifieds and non-wing sprints. Of note: There will be double modifieds features. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",
