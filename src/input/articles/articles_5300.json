    "title": "Un Amore review – the sexual tension is extremely hot",
    "text": "As Rod Stewart once sang, “the first cut is the deepest”. You never forget your first love and even if you spend the rest of your life in connubial bliss there’s something about that first infatuation that cannot be replicated, or entirely recovered from. Italian romantic drama Un Amore posits that first love is both a blessing and a curse. Alessandro and Anna meet as naive Interrailing youths in the 90s and quickly fall head over heels for one another. In the present day they are middle aged and have outwardly met many of the markers of success, but neither ever truly recovered from the relationship and they have both spent the decades since with a void in their lives that only their first love could fill. The series cuts between the summer they met and the complicated present, where Anna (Micaela Ramazzotti in the present/Beatrice Fiorentini in the past) is married to a sweet, albeit unobservant, man called Guido, working for an environmental agency and coming to terms with her son becoming an independent adult. Meanwhile Alessandro (Stefano Accorsi in the present/Luca Santoro in the past) has flourished as an architect and lives a more footloose existence, never settling down for long enough to build a family outside his relationship with his fiery mother, Teresa. The series sees the pair reunite in Bologna after decades apart, while cutting to the first union and slowly unspooling why they parted ways. Both storylines are elegantly performed and strikingly composed; the 90s aesthetic is precise but bathed in a rose-tinted warmth that evokes treasured memories. In contrast the present is cold and clinical; the dreary realities of adulthood have set in and drained the landscape of youthful optimism. While this makes sense conceptually, the juxtaposition is occasionally jarring, and the actors playing the past and present selves bear so little resemblance that the storylines don’t convince as different stages in the same lives. The love between the two, though, feels lived and true. Both pairings have scintillating chemistry and a sexual frisson that is, to put it crudely, extremely hot. But beyond showcasing some romantic moments – and the bone-chilling existential horror that the choices you make as a teenager may mean that happiness can permanently slip through your fingers – this is not a love story that requires eight hour-long episodes to do it justice. Director Francesco Lagi, best known for pitch-black comedy Missione Di Pace, seems just as enamoured by his characters as they are with each other. In both timelines he luxuriates in every steamy glance, pregnant pause and gentle caress. But at times it is hard to feel as connected to their love as the series presumes we are. The story holds that the two have a love that defies logic, that they are linked in a way that is unencumbered by the fact that they don’t really know each other any more. The love between them is framed as impossible, tragic and near supernatural, but also that the obstacles keeping them apart are insurmountable. If we are to hold that this pair have a rare bond, that their souls ache when they are apart, then it lowers the dramatic stakes and proves frustrating that they don’t just figure this the hell out by episode two. When it has been 25 years, divorce is a perfectly socially acceptable outcome to a marriage with a sole adult child. Both sides have kept the love alive through fastidious letter writing and still make each other’s hearts skip a beat, so it’s hard not to scream at the screen for them to just figure it out. Something truly enchanting is at Un Amore’s core: a sincere belief in love that lasts through the ages, and the deeply romantic notion that you may come across a person on a train who for ever changes your very being. But as much as their love endures, the compelling narrative wanes. This is a love that is only endlessly fascinating to those who are wrapped up in it. • Un Amore is on Sky Atlantic and Now",

    "text": "Des opérations de nettoyage étaient en cours, vendredi 1ᵉʳ novembre, à Taïwan, après le passage de Kong-rey, l’un des plus gros typhons que l’île ait connu ces dernières décennies et qui a fait a moins deux morts et plus de 500 blessés. La tempête, accompagnée de bourrasques atteignant 184 km/h et de pluies torrentielles, a touché terre jeudi en début d’après-midi au sud-est du territoire, et a balayé l’île entière, renversant des arbres, provoquant des inondations et des glissements de terrain. Un motard de 48 ans a été tué, jeudi à Taipei, par un poteau électrique qui lui est tombé dessus, et une femme de 56 ans est morte après la chute d’un arbre sur son véhicule, dans le comté de Nantou, a déclaré l’Agence nationale des incendies, tandis que plus de 500 autres personnes ont été blessées. Des recherches sont en cours pour retrouver quatre personnes parties chasser dans les montagnes du centre du pays, mercredi, et dont on est sans nouvelles depuis ce soir-là. Après le passage du puissant typhon Gaemi, la crainte d’une marée noire aux Philippines En traversant le détroit de Taïwan en direction de la Chine, vendredi, Kong-rey s’est affaibli pour devenir une forte tempête tropicale, selon l’Administration météorologique centrale. Dans tout Taïwan, le travail et les cours ont repris, et les magasins et les restaurants ont rouvert. Dans la région de Taitung, où le typhon s’est abattu en premier, aucun « dégât grave » n’est à déplorer, selon un représentant des pompiers de la province. 11 500 personnes évacuées « Ce sont surtout des arbres qui sont tombés et qui se sont écrasés sur les poteaux électriques qui ont provoqué des pannes de courant », a déclaré le pompier, qui n’a donné que son nom de famille, Huang. Plus de 11 500 personnes à travers l’île avaient évacué leur domicile, les autorités ayant mis en garde contre les glissements de terrain. Taïwan est habitué aux tempêtes tropicales, fréquentes de juillet à octobre, mais il est « inhabituel pour un typhon si puissant de frapper l’île aussi tard dans l’année », note le météorologue Chang Chun-yao. Le changement climatique augmente leur intensité, avec de grandes averses, des crues soudaines et de très fortes rafales de vent, selon les scientifiques. Kong-rey est le troisième typhon à frapper Taïwan depuis juillet.

    "text": "Key Points\nAamir Khan to represent Indian cinema at international festival\nIFFM celebrates diversity and inclusivity in storytelling\nFestival screens 75 films highlighting social themes\nEvent backed by Government of Victoria\nThe ceremony will take place as part of the festival's annual Independence Day celebrations.\n\"The flag hoisting ceremony at IFFM is more than just a formal tradition; it's a deeply emotional and unifying experience. Seeing the Tiranga unfurl on foreign soil, surrounded by artists, filmmakers, and members of the Indian and Australian communities, fills our hearts with pride,\" said festival director Mitu Bhowmick Lange.\nThe festival director added: \"Having Aamir Khan, whose voice vision and cinema has had a profound impact on generations of film lovers not just in India but globally , lead this moment is truly a rare honour.\"\nBhowmick added that Aamir's presence represents the strength and integrity of Indian storytelling and \"the values we stand for at IFFM, equality and unity in diversity. We look forward to welcoming audiences from all walks of life to witness this inspiring moment.\"\nIFFM, backed by the Government of Victoria, stands as the largest Indian film festival held outside of India. With a legacy of showcasing powerful and diverse Indian stories, the festival continues to be a beacon of inclusivity and cinematic excellence.\nIn other news, the restored version of filmmaker Prem Kapoor's 1971 'Badnaam Basti', which is described as India's first gay film, will be showcased at the The Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) for its pride celebratory night.\nThis year, IFFM will screen nearly 75 films that reflect themes of inclusivity spanning gender, race, sexuality, disability, and women's representation. One of the most anticipated highlights of the festival is the LGBTQ+ Pride Night scheduled for August 22, which promises to be a powerful tribute to queer cinema and Queer South Asian identity in Australia.\nThe festival will also have acclaimed actress Tillotama Shome's Bengali film \"Baksho Bondi - Shadowbox\" opening the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM).\nCo-directed by Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi in their directorial debut, Baksho Bondi, which had its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival 2025, is jointly produced by Tillotama and Jim Sarbh.\nThe film features Tillotama Shome as Maya, set against the backdrop of a dusty Kolkata suburb, weaving a powerful narrative of love, resilience, and the quiet strength of a working woman navigating her everyday life.\nReader Comments\nWe welcome thoughtful discussions from our readers.

    "text": "Посчитали количество олимпиадников и увидели, что в Татарстане, Москве, и даже Ямало-Ненецком автономном округе их в несколько раз больше, чем в Башкирии. Что с регионом не так?\nВаловой внутренний продукт в расчёте на душу населения является основополагающим показателем, определяющим благосостояние страны. По данным МВФ, лидерами являются Люксембург, Ирландия, Швейцария, Сингапур, Исландия, страны не обладающие значительными природными богатствами.\nРоссия, обладающая феноменальными природными ископаемыми, в данном рейтинге на 71 месте.\nГлавный ресурс страны – талантливые дети.\nБлагосостояние государства сейчас определяется уровнем инновационного развития, эффективностью использования интеллектуального потенциала стран.\nТрансформация экономики повысила роль инноваций в развитии, это породило потребность в людях, обладающих нестандартным мышлением и умением создавать и реализовывать инновационные проекты.\nПоэтому эффективность государственной политики по выявлению, поддержке и развитию способностей и талантов у детей и молодёжи оказывает глобальное влияние на технологическое лидерство, ускоренное развитие инновационных секторов экономики.\nТалантливые дети – это главный ресурс, формирующий успешное будущее нации. Вследствие этого деятельность по выявлению и развитию одарённых детей является общенациональным приоритетом всех успешных стран мира, потому что человек, а не природные ресурсы, сейчас определяет успешность страны.\nБашкирия – родина детей-олимпиадников\nВ России основным механизмом выявления и развития детских талантов стало олимпиадное движение среди школьников, оно позволяет результативно выявлять и развивать талантливых детей. Эффективность этой деятельности во многом формирует будущее региона.\nПо итогам заключительного этапа Всероссийской олимпиады школьников (ВСОШ) 2024/25 учебного года по числу победителей и призёров Башкирия заняла 7 место.\nВсероссийская олимпиада школьников — это самое масштабное интеллектуальное соревнование России, в нём ежегодно участвует около 7 млн человек, организатор – Министерство просвещения РФ.\nПобедители и призёры заключительного этапа ВСОШ\nОлимпиада проводилась по 24 предметам, победителями и призёрами заключительного этапа олимпиады стали 4 017 участников (победители – 674 школьника, а 3 343 ученика – призёры). Эти ребята получили право поступления в ведущие российские вузы без вступительных испытаний.\nТоп-10 по числу победителей и призёров финала\nНа первом месте с большим отрывом Москва, у которой 1 863 победителя и призёра. У Башкортостана – 57, из них 26 – школьники из Уфы (45,6%).\nНо более объективным является рейтинг регионов, составленный по числу победителей и призёров на 100 тысяч жителей региона, так как демонстрирует эффективность работы региона по развитию талантов школьников.\nВ пятёрку лидеров входят Москва, Московская область, Республика Татарстан, Санкт-Петербург и Ямало-Ненецкий Автономный округ.\nБашкирия на 17 месте, но следует отметить положительную динамику республики за последние два года. Хотя выше 16 места за всю историю ВСОШ республика никогда не поднималась.\nДля достижения результатов Татарстана, Ямало-Ненецкого АО, Мордовии, Калининградской области Башкортостану необходимо менять принципы поддержки и развития одарённых детей.\nНапример, использовать опыт Ямало-Ненецкого АО, который сейчас входит в пятёрку лидеров, хотя в 2019 году округ был на 60 месте.\nСтремительное улучшение результатов Ямало-Ненецкого АО во многом определяется выдачей образовательных сертификатов – именных документов, подтверждающих право обучающихся, проявивших способности, на оплату обучения по программам подготовки участия в предметных олимпиадах со стоимостью 81 тысяча рублей.\nЭто улучшило развитие юных талантов, за счёт предоставления им возможностей использования образовательных ресурсов наиболее значимых центров олимпиадной подготовки страны.\nОбразовательные сертификаты на конкурсной основе получили 1413 старшеклассников, что позволило одарённым детям пройти обучение у ведущих преподавателей страны, включая НИУ Высшая школа экономики, Санкт-Петербургского государственного университета, НИУ Московского физико-технического института.\nПочему они могут, а мы нет?\nОб олимпиадной подготовке школьников Татарстана можно говорить много, но самое главное в ней системность, эффективное использование потенциала высшего образования, активное участие муниципальных структур. В частности, в каждом районе и городе реализуются муниципальные программы «Одарённые дети» с поставленными целями, а самое главное – выделяется соответствующее финансирование. Так например, в Нурлатском районе только на участие школьников в учебно-тренировочных лагерях, на подготовку детей к республиканскому этапу ВСОШ ежегодно выделяется свыше 800 тысяч рублей.\nНа Казанский Центр для одарённых детей, в котором проходят подготовку 230 детей, ежегодно выделяется 16,5 млн рублей.\nКоординирует работу муниципальных структур и осуществляет общее руководство деятельности по выявлению и развитию детских талантов Университет Талантов, который реализует республиканские программы поддержки одарённых детей. Объём ежегодного финансирования его деятельности около 120 млн рублей.\nОбщий размер финансирования в Татарстане в 5 раз выше, чем в Башкирии. Поэтому в Татарстане 265 победителей и призёров ВСОШ, а в Башкирии – 57.\nПри этом следует отметить доминирование Москвы: 44% победителей и призёров ВСОШ – это москвичи. Мэр Москвы Сергей Собянин, поздравляя в этом году участников с успешным выступлением отметил, что победители и призёры учатся в более чем половине школ столицы.\nНахождение Башкирии во втором эшелоне связано со следующими обстоятельствами: формальные принципы работы; есть ряд принятых документов, но за их исполнением никто не следит.\nОдаренные дети Башкирии никому не нужны\nТак, есть Попечительский Совет при Правительстве Республики Башкортостан по вопросам выявления, поддержки и развития способностей и талантов у детей и молодёжи, который уже не собирался несколько лет и фактически бездействует.\nУтверждена правительством концепция развития одарённых детей и молодёжи в Республике Башкортостан, однако показатели, заложенные в ней, не выполняются.\nНизкий уровень финансирования: в плане мероприятий по реализации концепции развития одарённых детей и молодёжи в Республике Башкортостан, утверждённой республиканским правительством, указаны десятки мероприятий, большинство из них без финансирования.\nОтсутствует системное взаимодействие между высшим образованием, муниципалитетами и Центром развития талантов «Аврора», отвечающим за работу с одарёнными детьми в республике.\nПри таких обстоятельствах существующие результаты – это подвиг тех, кто готовит детей к участию во ВСОШ.\nУспех других регионов был осуществлён за счет мобилизации своих ресурсов для достижения поставленных целей. У нас дети не менее одарённые, только республиканские чиновники не ориентированы на результат.\nНеобходимо менять форматы работы с одарёнными детьми за счёт системного решения задач, что обеспечит успешное их участие в школьных олимпиадах.",
