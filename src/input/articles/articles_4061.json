    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power in wake of Storm Gerrit The Met Office confirmed the worst of the conditions passed. Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "BELOIT — Fort Atkinson's 19U American Legion Post 166 baseball team earned a pair of down-to-the-wire victories over host Beloit on Wednesday.\nThe Hawks (7-2-1) scored five runs in the seventh inning to overtake the Bandits, 8-7, before scoring three runs in the seventh en route to winning the finale, 12-9.\nIn the first game, Beloit's Brenin Pearson drove in the go-ahead run with a double in the home half of the sixth.\nFort countered with a five-run rally in the top of the seventh.\nBraiden Wainwright led off the inning by drawing a walk, took second on a passed ball before scoring the tying run after Benett Thompson bunted and reached on catcher Brody Berg's error.\nAfter Brogan Bosch singled, Braeden Hoth drove in the go-ahead run with a fly ball single to center to put the Hawks up 5-4. Gavin Kanters added an RBI single before Alexis Martinez had a run-scoring ground out.\nThe Bandits made things interesting in the bottom of the seventh.\nAfter Berg and Noah Pfundheller each drew two-out walks off Thompson, Brayden Ward produced an RBI double. Willmy Henriquez followed with a two-run single to make it 8-7. Thompson then struck out Sam Erickson swinging to end it.\nMason Ketterhagen started for Fort and allowed three earned runs on seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. Wainwright pitched 2 2/3 innings of two-hit ball to earn the decision before Thompson pitched the seventh.\nKanters finished 2-for-3 with a triple and two RBIs while Martinez also drove home two runs.\nThe Hawks jumped ahead 9-0 through three and a half innings in the second game, only to see the Bandits score three runs apiece in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings to tie it up.\nFort's three-run seventh started when Brady Byrnes drew a four-pitch walk. With one away, Hoth singled and took second on the throw, which allowed Byrnes to come around to score the go-ahead run.\nWith two away, Kanters was intentionally walked and Martinez drew a walk to load the bases. Kohen Brant drove in two insurance runs with a hard-hit ground ball single to center.\nByrnes pitched 1 1/3 no-hit innings in relief to earn the decision. He tossed a 1-2-3 seventh.\nColin Schrader started for Fort and surrendered four earned runs on six hits in four frames. Martinez gave up three earned runs on two hits in 1 2/3 innings.\nThe teams combined for 20 hits, including 12 by the Hawks who tallied five extra-base knocks. Hoth, Kanters, Ketterhagen, Brant and Ketterhagen had two hits each. Kanters scored three runs and doubled twice while Brant notched three RBIs.\nFort produced a five-run rally in the second inning, which Bosch capped by slugging a two-run homer to center on a 2-0 pitch. Byrnes' two-out RBI single in the third pushed the Hawks' advantage to 7-0.\nFort hosts Janesville on Monday at 7:30 p.m.\nFirst game\nFORT 8, BELOIT 7\nFort 201 000 5 -- 8 7 1\nBeloit 002 101 3 -- 7 11 4\nLeading hitters -- FA: Kanters 2x3 (3B), Ketterhagen (2B); B: Berg 3x3 (2 2B), Ward 2x4 (2B), Pearson (2B)\nPitching (ip-h-r-er-bb-so) -- FA: Ketterhagen 3.1-7-3-3-3-2, Wainwright W; 2.2-2-1-1-1-1, Thompson 1-2-3-3-2-1; B: Halon 5.1-3-3-2-4-9, Pfundheller L; 1.2-4-5-2-2-0\nSecond game\nFORT 12, BELOIT 9\nFort 151 200 3 -- 12 12 2\nBeloit 000 333 0 -- 9 8 3\nLeading hitters -- FA: Kanters 2x4 (2 2B), Hoth 2x4 (2B), Martinez 2x4 (3B), Brant 2x4, Ketterhagen 2x3, Bosch (HR); B: Halon 3x4, Henriquez (3B), Piccione 2x3 (3B), Pearson (2B)\nPitching (ip-h-r-er-bb-so) -- FA: Schrader 4-6-6-4-2-3, Martinez 1.2-2-3-3-4-2, Byrnes W; 1.1-0-0-0-0-0; B: West 4-10-9-3-2-0, Erickson L; 3-2-3-3-4-2",

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Influenza happens all year round in Malaysia, but it's likely that more cases occur in January and July compared with other months.\nThese two months recorded the highest positive rate for influenza samples tested in Malaysia over the past three years, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).\nHowever, experts say such peaks are less distinct than those in temperate zones like Europe, Japan and New Zealand.\n“Although it is possible for tropical countries like Malaysia to have increased incidence of influenza during certain months, these peaks are less pronounced as there is no distinctly cold season in Malaysia,” said epidemiologist Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud.\nHe said in temperate countries, influenza tends to occur in the colder months.\n“During the colder months, people tend to congregate indoors, the temperatures and humidity are lower and there are likely to have been some changes in the virus itself.\n“These factors tend to favour survival and transmission of the virus which leads to peaks in those colder months,” he said.\nVirologist Dr Jasmine E. Khairat said influenza cases often peak in January for temperate regions in the northern hemisphere and July for those in the southern hemisphere.\n“In tropical climates like Malaysia, while there may be some peaks, influenza can circulate more consistently throughout the year.\n“But rainfall patterns and humidity can also influence the timing of peaks,” said Dr Jasmine, who is a senior lecturer at the Institute of Biological Sciences at Universiti Malaya.\nClick the arrow buttons below to see the influenza trends in Malaysia from 2022 to January this year:\nIn Malaysia, it was reported that the demand for flu vaccines spiked following news of the death of Taiwanese actress Barbie Hsu, 48, from a flu in Japan recently.\nOn Feb 10, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad announced the expansion of the Influenza Immunisation Programme, which was launched in 2006.\nAs a result, the programme will cover not only frontline healthcare workers but also senior citizens aged 60 and above with at least one chronic illness.\nOn Feb 18, the voluntary vaccination drive began - a move that would benefit over 170,000 high-risk senior citizens, who can make appointments through the MySejahtera app.\nIs it A or B?\nCurrently, there are two types of influenza viruses in Malaysia: Influenza A with its subtypes, and Influenza B.\nBoth types of influenza took turns to be the most common type in Malaysia at different times, based on data from WHO.\nInfluenza B was dominant in late 2022 to early 2023, but has since been overtaken by Influenza A until today.\nAs of Jan 27, Influenza A and its subtypes made up 71.8% of the positive influenza samples in Malaysia.\nWhile influenza dominance changes, Dr Jasmine said influenza A was typically more prevalent.\nShe said past seasons, like 2016 and 2022, have seen influenza B dominate, but this was less common.\n“This change among flu strains is a natural part of how these viruses evolve.\n“One reason is because influenza A mutates faster, evading immunity from past infections or vaccines.\n“This creates competition: the strain best at spreading and finding susceptible people persists,” Dr Jasmine explained.\nAnother factor was population immunity at a certain time.\n“If many are immune to one strain (either by past infections or vaccination), another strain can take over against which the population has less immunity, to become more prevalent,” she said.\nDr Awang Bulgiba said Influenza A and B virus types tend to co-circulate so it is quite possible to see both types at the same time, which is what Malaysia is facing now.\nSee the graphic below to know more about each influenza type:\nAnnual flu jabs for all?\nIn future, experts believe that annual flu jabs will likely be a norm for many Malaysians.\nDescribing it as a good thing, Dr Jasmine said demand will likely rise as public awareness increases and the benefits of vaccination are better understood.\n“I hope accessible vaccination programmes will play a vital role in making this a reality,” she said.\nDr Awang Bulgiba said Malaysia’s population was ageing and as a result, disease patterns will change.\n“With ageing comes increased risks of chronic diseases like diabetes, which increases the vulnerability of individuals to infections like influenza.\n“The provision of free flu jabs for seniors will provide an incentive for seniors to better protect themselves against influenza and therefore reduce the incidence of serious cases of influenza,” he said.\nAs such, he said annual flu jabs will become more common and hopefully lessen the burden on healthcare services as fewer people will fall ill or have serious illnesses due to influenza.\nAt present, it is a common practice for many travellers to get influenza shots before going abroad.\nHere’s a list of the peak influenza positive rates for tested samples in the top 10 countries visited by Malaysians in 2023.\nOn the current initiative by Malaysia to vaccinate senior citizens, Dr Jasmine said it should be expanded to other age groups.\n“This is especially for those with underlying health conditions like chronic respiratory issues.\n“A broader vaccination strategy can help reduce overall influenza transmission and protect vulnerable populations,” she said.\nAside from senior citizens, Dr Awang Bulgiba said young children were also vulnerable to influenza as they might not have been exposed to the virus.\n“As such, their immune system might not be primed for the influenza virus.\n“Eventually, when financial conditions allow, I believe that free flu jabs could be extended to young children,” he said.\nDr Jasmine hoped that the government would improve community surveillance to track influenza activity and identify circulating strains, including conduct more accessible testing and reporting.\n“Equally important is to ensure adequate vaccine supply and promote vaccination campaigns.\n“This ensures that everyone who needs a flu shot can get one, and that people understand why it's so important,” she said.\nDr Jasmine urged everyone to get an annual flu shot as vaccination, describing it as the people’s most powerful tool for protection.\n“It's not just about protecting ourselves. It's about protecting our family, friends and community.\n“And finally, don't underestimate the impact of simple hygiene practices – handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes – these actions can significantly limit the spread of the virus,” she said.\nAs Malaysia takes steps to tackle influenza, here’s a list of the peak positive rates for tested influenza samples in other countries around the world.\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",
