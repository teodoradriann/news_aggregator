    "text": "Merck said its experimental treatment designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus showed positive results in a mid- to late-stage trial. The pharmaceutical giant could emerge as a new competitor in the market for treatments against RSV, which causes hundreds of infant deaths each year. Merck is discussing the study data with regulators worldwide, with a goal of making the treatment available for infants as early as the 2025 to 2026 RSV season. Merck on Thursday said its experimental treatment designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus showed positive results in a mid- to late-stage trial, bringing the company one step closer to filing for approval of the shot.\nThe pharmaceutical giant could emerge as a new competitor in the market for treatments against RSV, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year. Complications from the virus are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns, making Merck’s drug a valuable new treatment option if approved.\nMerck plans to discuss the study data with regulators worldwide, with a goal of making the treatment available for infants as early as the 2025 to 2026 RSV season, according to a release.\nThe trial examined the safety and efficacy of a single dose of the treatment, clesrovimab, in healthy preterm and full-term infants entering their first RSV season. Merck presented the results at the medical conference IDWeek in Los Angeles.\nThe treatment reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% and decreased hospitalizations due to lower respiratory infections by 90% compared with a placebo among infants through five months, according to Merck. Clesrovimab also reduced lower respiratory infections that required medical attention by more than 60% compared with a placebo through five months.\nRSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. Results were consistent through both the five-month and six-month time points in the trial, Merck said.\nThe rates of adverse and serious side effects were comparable between patients who received Merck’s shot and those who took placebos in the trial. There were no treatment or RSV-related deaths in the study, the company added.\n“These promising results demonstrating decreased incidence of RSV disease, including hospitalizations, highlight the potential for clesrovimab to play an important role in helping to alleviate the continued burden of RSV on infants and their families,” Dr. Octavio Ramilo, chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, said in Merck’s release. Ramilo is also an investigator working on the trials.\nMerck’s clesrovimab could potentially compete against a similar treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca called Beyfortus, which was in short supply nationwide last RSV season due to unprecedented demand. Both are monoclonal antibodies, which deliver antibodies directly into the bloodstream to provide immediate protection.\nBut Merck’s treatment can be administered to infants regardless of their weight, which the company said may offer convenience in terms of dosing. Meanwhile, the recommended dosage of Beyfortus is based on an infant’s body weight.\nLast year, Pfizer and GSK rolled out RSV vaccines that are administered to expectant mothers who can pass on protection to their fetuses.",

    "text": "Treatment emerges for rare, symptomless heart condition in Cytokinetics drug trial [James Powel](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12244761002/james-powel/) A new drug to treat a rare heart condition may be set to go before the Food and Drug Administration. Pharmaceutical company Cytokinetics [announced Wednesday](https://ir.cytokinetics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-announces-positive-results-sequoia-hcm-pivotal) that its drug aficamten produced, \"statistically significant and clinically meaningful\" results in the phase three trial of the [drug](/story/news/2023/12/25/weight-loss-abortion-drug-prices-psychedelics-hot-topics-of-2024/72027935007/). Aficamten is intended to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition that thickens the heart muscle and is present in .2% of the world's population, [according to the National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430788/). The company said in its press release that full results of the study would be presented at, \"an upcoming medical conference.\" If the drug does make it to market it would compete against Bristol Meyer's drug Camzyos. \"A therapy like aficamten that improves exercise capacity in a clinically meaningful manner, absent low (left ventricular ejection fraction) events that interrupt treatment, should be a welcome addition for HCM patients as well as the clinicians who treat them,\" Martin Maron, M.D., Director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts and principal investigator for the trial said. Cytokinetics stock closed down a quarter of a percent at [$83.24 per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK) Thursday but is still up significantly from [Tuesday's close of $45.71](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK/history?p=CYTK). What did the phase three trial find? Patients in the trial arm saw improvement in exercise tolerance, peak oxygen uptake and \"clinically meaningful improvements\" in the study's secondary endpoints including participant's Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score, according to the release. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score is a test that measures, \"symptoms, physical and social limitations, and quality of life in patients with heart failure,\" [according to the Journal of American College of Cardiology](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.542). Serious adverse effects occurred in 5.6% of people in the trial arm and 9.3% of people in the placebo arm. What is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken and makes it more difficult to pump blood, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198). The condition is usually caused by genetics and does not cause symptoms in many cases. Symptoms, if they are experienced, can include: - Chest pain - Fainting - Heart murmur - Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations) - Shortness of breath The Mayo Clinic recommends seeking immediate medical attention if a person is experiencing rapid or irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing or chest pain. Loyola Marymount basketball star [Hank Gathers](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1201/p738.html) was killed by a cardiac arrest during a game in 1990 and his autopsy found that he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Oklahoma City Thunder [draft pick](https://www.nba.com/thunder/news/release-johnson-230707) and former Florida Gator and Kansas State Wildcat star Keyonte Johnson was [diagnosed with the condition](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2023/06/23/okc-thunder-voices-zero-concerns-over-keyontae-johnsons-heart-condition/) after collapsing in a game in 2020.",

    "title": "Atlanta Hawks soar past shorthanded Charlotte Hornets with Trae Young's explosive 31 points and prepare for crucial battles against NBA titans including Stephen Curry",
    "text": "Week in Review\nThe Atlanta Hawks experienced a mix of results this week. While a loss against Brooklyn highlighted some defensive shortcomings, victories over lower-tier opponents rejuvenated the team’s momentum. The overall performance places them at 17th in the league rankings, emphasizing both the challenges they face and the room for improvement ahead.\nThrilling Victory Against Charlotte\nOn the road, the Hawks delivered a commanding 134-102 win over a shorthanded Charlotte Hornets team. Trae Young emerged as the standout performer, scoring 31 points and distributing eight assists. His efficiency from beyond the arc—making five of nine attempts—secured his place among the elite players who have achieved 30-point games paired with multiple long-range shots. This win marked the most dominant performance of the season and completed a season sweep against their divisional rival.\nCrew Contributions and Defensive Play\nThe success of the game was underscored by strong contributions from multiple players. Dyson Daniels came close to a triple-double by adding 22 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists to his stat line, while Zaccharie Risacher delivered 21 points, including an explosive third quarter that sparked the Hawks’ offensive surge. The team’s collective shooting efficiency of 54% from the field and 49% from three-point range significantly disrupted the opponent’s rhythm. A disciplined defensive effort forced 17 turnovers, leading to 22 fast-break points, and helped maintain an impressive offensive rating throughout the match.\nLooking Ahead\nThe schedule promises further tests as the Hawks prepare to face formidable teams featuring some of the sport’s most talented figures. With a brief three-day rest period ahead of hosting a high-profile matchup at State Farm Arena, the team is focused and determined. Every game brings them closer to playoff contention as they continue to refine their playmaking and tighten their defensive strategies in challenging encounters.",

    "text": "How a Leading DePIN Project is Innovating the Solar Industry\nPse.USDT Leads the Solar Industry with DePIN, Making Users Key Players in Energy Distribution.\nAs cryptocurrencies and Web3 increasingly integrate into our daily lives, a pressing question arises: How can these digital advancements be translated into tangible infrastructure for everyday use? The evolution of Web3 beyond virtual spaces and digital assets heralds a new era where these technological innovations will significantly impact our physical world.\nWhy is the Practical Application of Blockchain Crucial?\nThe journey of blockchain from a virtual concept to practical applications marks a significant evolution. It is no longer just about cryptocurrencies and online transactions. Now, blockchain is poised to become a fundamental tool for constructing and managing physical infrastructure, making it more efficient, transparent, and decentralized.\nThis transformative role of blockchain extends especially to areas where technology intersects critically with physical infrastructure. The energy industry is one such field. As we strive to address environmental challenges and shift towards renewable resources, blockchain offers solutions for managing these vital resources.\nThis is where DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) comes into play, particularly in the energy sector. DePIN represents an approach to energy infrastructure that changes how we produce, distribute, and consume energy. In a world increasingly focused on sustainability and efficiency, DePIN provides a way to decentralize energy systems, making them more resilient, responsive, and aligned with Web3 principles.\nAt the heart of this discussion is the intersection of DePIN and blockchain. These innovations not only redefine the digital realm but also reshape the foundation of our physical infrastructure. By combining blockchain with DePIN, we see energy systems that are not only smart but also community-driven and inherently democratic.\nLet us explore the role of DePIN and blockchain in promoting a new era of decentralized energy—an era that brings the promises of Web3 into our daily lives, transforming the way we interact with and benefit from the energy around us.\nExploring the Connection Between DePIN and Blockchain\nDePIN represents a new model for building physical infrastructure networks—from mobile solutions and telecommunication services to energy systems. What sets DePIN apart is its focus on community-driven development rather than the traditional corporate-led approach. Through blockchain, these networks use tokens to incentivize communities to collaborate from the ground up in constructing and maintaining these infrastructures.\nBlockchain is the perfect complement to the DePIN model. The inherent transparency and immutability of blockchain ensure data security and reliability. In DePIN projects, blockchain acts as a trustless intermediary, providing a secure and transparent way to record transactions, track contributions, and distribute rewards within the network.\nAdditionally, integrating smart contracts into these systems enhances efficiency. These automatically executing contracts with predefined rules can streamline various processes within DePIN, reducing the need for intermediaries. This automation is particularly impactful in areas like transaction settlements and incentive distributions, where traditional methods often involve complexity and delays.\nMoreover, decentralizing control is not just about democratizing infrastructure. It also enhances the network's resilience and adaptability. The decentralization of DePIN spreads decision-making power across a broader network, allowing it to respond more flexibly to changes and challenges. It enables infrastructure to develop in a more inclusive and collaborative manner, recognizing and rewarding the contributions of every participant.\nAdopting DePIN marks a leap into the future where infrastructure is designed to be resilient, decentralized, and autonomously aligned with the evolving needs of the community. In this future, the role of blockchain will transcend the digital realm, directly impacting and shaping our physical world.\nPse.USDT's DePIN Concept: A Pioneer in Solar Decentralization\nJust as Helium has become a well-known brand for decentralizing communication among smart devices, Pse.USDT is emerging as a pioneer in the solar energy sector. Their implementation of the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) concept is reshaping how solar energy is accessed and utilized.\nAs a DecEnergy (Decentralized Energy) platform utilizing DePIN, Pse.USDT plays a crucial role. Similar to how Helium establishes decentralized networks for the Internet of Things (IoT), Pse.USDT applies similar principles to solar energy. Their approach involves creating a network where individuals with solar panels can not only consume energy but also become integral parts of a larger decentralized energy system.\nBy leveraging DePIN, Pse.USDT is making solar energy more widespread and accessible, allowing everyone to benefit. This isn't just about harnessing solar power; it's about transforming every solar panel owner into an active participant in the energy market. This shift from mere consumers to producers and distributors democratizes the energy landscape, aligning perfectly with the spirit and principles of Web3 and decentralization.\nPse.USDT's DePIN model ensures that solar energy production is not centralized but distributed across a network of individual producers. This structure not only optimizes the use of renewable energy but also empowers homeowners and businesses to control their own energy production and consumption.\nTransforming Renewable Energy with Blockchain\nAt the core of Pse.USDT's blockchain is the \"Proof of Generation\" consensus mechanism. This system prioritizes the production of renewable energy, aligning blockchain operations with net-zero goals. It minimizes the environmental impact of blockchain while supporting the creation of sustainable energy.\nHigh Expectations for Pse.USDT\nPse.USDT has made significant strides in the DecEnergy sector, managing over 1 megawatt of solar power capacity globally. Their partnerships with leading solar companies underscore their growing influence. With more households adopting solar panels, Pse.USDT has enormous growth potential. Their vision includes expanding energy certificates to the electric vehicle sector, further enhancing their green energy solutions.\nPse.USDT exemplifies the real-world application of blockchain technology, providing both direct economic benefits and promoting environmental sustainability. By combining blockchain with solar solutions, they are adopting new technologies to create a more sustainable and empowered future.

    "text": "PATAGONIA, Ariz. (KVOA) - It's the largest private investment ever made in Southern Arizona and is getting closer to being fully operational.\nThe Hermosa Mine in the Patagonia Mountains, owned by Australian company South32, is starting to hire more and more workers as it prepares to be fully operational in 2027.\nThe mine will produce two minerals South32 considers critical for U.S. interests, Zinc and Manganese.\nCurrently those two minerals, used to create batteries, are mostly produced in China.\nHermosa Mine President Pat Reisner said the production has been fast tracked by the federal government and has been getting interest from the Department of Defense due to how important these materials are.\n“These resources are critical minerals because we’re dependent on foreign nations for our supply that creates risk for our country, that creates national security risk. It’s the only mine development that will produce two critical minerals,\" he said.\nBefore production can happen at full scale there is a lot of testing and construction going on at the site as well as off-site battery testing to make sure the materials are effective for their intended use.\nAll of these efforts have brought in more than 1,000 construction jobs. South32 is constructing a special facility in nearby Nogales that will allow workers with little to no experience the ability to control mining equipment virtually.\nSouth32 will be providing specialized training courses and employing upwards of 900 Santa Cruz County residents.\n“We’ve committed to over 80 percent of our long-term workforce being residents of Santa Cruz County,\" Reisner said.\nIn all South32 said there will be 2,381 direct and indirect jobs created in Santa Cruz County and 3,465 direct and indirect jobs created in Arizona as a result of the project.\nThere will be a labor income of $194 million in the County and $290 million statewide, according to South32.\nThe company said there will be an economic output of $1.16 billion for the County and $1.49 billion for the state.\nSouth32 also estimates there will be local tax revenues of $26 million for the county and $29 million for the state.\nReisner and his team gave News 4 Tucson's Chief Investigative Reporter Chorus Nylander a tour of the mine Wednesday morning.\nThere we could see a large mining shaft that Reisner said will go to depths of 3,000 feet. Using automated machinery they will be able to go even further, below 4,000 feet.\nReisner said the mine is much more compact than open pit mines. Giving a comparison he said the Hermosa mine is slightly larger than Disney Land at 750 acres. That is a tiny fraction of the average space of an Arizona open pit mine which he said goes beyond 10,000 acres.\nReisner said they are also trying to be good stewards of the environment and are going to be using 90 percent less water than mines of similar volume.\nThey are also looking at ways to better protect groundwater levels.\nThat's a big concern for many Santa Cruz County residents like Robin Lucky who leads the Calabasas Alliance, a local group focused on environmental protection.\n“What happens to a place when there’s no groundwater that sounds like a catastrophe to me,\" Lucky said.\nLucky recently got a tour of the mine herself and was happy to see some of the measures they are taking but still questions what the true impact to the areas water levels will be.\nShe said recent studies by the Arizona Department of Water Quality show the area has about 25 years of groundwater left. She worries the mine will use up too much of the precious resource that water is.\nShe is also concerned about air quality and the risk of toxins getting in the air. She said the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, working with Calabasas Alliance, have already started placing air quality sensors across the area.\nShe says they are using two types of monitors. The first is a PurpleAir that residents can view reporting for themselves here and a higher quality device.\n“We think baseline monitoring before extraction starts is incredibly important and we have the support of two major universities.”\nAfter over 35 years in the mining industry, Reisner said he's never been a part of such an environmentally conscious project.\n\"Without a doubt, there’s nothing even close to it.”",

El arresto del autor ha sido posible gracias a la colaboración del grupo de Robos de la Policía Nacional y agentes de la Policía Local, se resalta en el comunicado. El arrestado ha ingresado en prisión tras prestar declaración judicial a instancias de la Fiscalía. Se le acusa de un robo con fuerza. Sacristán El robo fue descubierto por el sacristán, que vio merodear a un hombre por delante de la sacristía y al que no conocía de nada, lo cual le infundió sospechas. Se acercó a esa sala, habitualmente cerrada, donde se revisten los sacerdotes y están guardados los ornamentos y otras cosas pertenecientes al culto, para descubrir que la puerta había sido forzada. No solo faltaban objetos religiosos que allí se guardaban sino instrumentos musicales. Mientras tanto, esa persona había desaparecido del templo. Entonces dio aviso a la Policía Local. Parroquia El sacristán comentó a los agentes lo ocurrido y facilitó la descripción de esta persona. Se dio la circunstancia de que, precisamente, minutos antes, habían identificado por las inmediaciones de la parroquia a alguien que casaba con la identificación del responsable de la parroquia. Se realizó un reportaje fotográfico y un informe de lo sucedido y se facilitó la descripción física y ropas por si alguien podía localizarlo, pero en un primer momento, no fue así. En gestiones posteriores, agentes de la [Policía Local](https://www.elche.es/policia-local/) sí identificaron a un hombre que portaba varios objetos religiosos de cuya procedencia no daba razones, por lo que, como medida preventiva, intervinieron los objetos y comunicaron tal hecho al Grupo de Robos de la Comisaría de Policía Nacional en Elche, encargado de la investigación. Ahora bien, el comunicado no explica por qué no se le detuvo. Entre los objetos que le decomisaron también estaba así como dos guitarras, un amplificador y un micrófono. La coordinación y cooperación entre los diferentes cuerpos de seguridad es esencial para ofrecer un servicio de calidad a la ciudadanía, siendo un criterio necesario para garantizar la seguridad pública en todos los ámbitos, explican desde la Comisaría de Elche Propiedad de la iglesia El Grupo de Investigación especializado en Robos, continuó con las pesquisas y, tras analizar las imágenes de las cámaras de seguridad del lugar, se pudo identificar plenamente al autor de los hechos. Además de esto, el propio sacristán de la parroquia reconoció los objetos intervenidos por la Policía Local al investigado como propiedad de la parroquia. Ante todo ello, los agentes adscritos al [Grupo de Robos de la Policía Nacional en Elche](https://www.policia.es/_gl/dependencias_localizador_accesible_provincias.php), iniciaron un dispositivo de búsqueda de esta persona que culminó con su detención y la recuperación de una caja de color rojo que contenía más objetos religiosos tales como; un crucifijo y una esfera metálica dorada, una caja de plástico conteniendo medallas doradas con la imagen de la virgen y una cruz metálica dorada, que resultaron pertenecer también a la parroquia y que fueron entregados al sacristán convenientemente. La nota también asegura que se robaron instrumentos musicales, pero no detalla cuáles y si se han recuperado. Antecedentes El arrestado, de 50 años de edad y que contaba con multitud de antecedentes por delitos similares, fue puesto a disposición del Juzgado de Instrucción de guardia de la localidad de Elche, que decretó su ingreso en prisión. La Comisaría destaca que \"la coordinación y cooperación entre los diferentes cuerpos de seguridad es esencial para ofrecer un servicio de calidad a la ciudadanía, siendo un criterio necesario para garantizar la seguridad pública en todos los ámbitos\". Por desgracia, los robos en templos e iglesias, donde apenas hay medidas de seguridad [son relativamente habituales](https://www.informacion.es/vega-baja/2023/06/01/detienen-hombre-37-anos-robo-88176379.html) por la, cómo no, buena fe de las propias parroquias.
