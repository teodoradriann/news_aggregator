    "title": "2025 Kids Count Data Book ranks Wyoming as 23 in nation",
    "text": "The latest data book for child well-being has been released, and Wyoming has fallen back down in the rankings.\nThe Kids Count Data Book is produced by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which works to improve outcomes for children through grants, research and advocacy. The annual publication reports on major issues impacting children, especially those that affect or lead to changes in poverty levels. However, the rankings are relative to how other states are doing.\nCurrently, Wyoming ranks 23, which is five places lower than last year.\nInformation in the Kids Count Databook lags by about one to two years, so this year’s report includes data from 2023 and 2024.\nThe new data shows that compared to 2019, there are more kids in poverty, more students not being proficient in reading or math, more teen obesity and more children in single-parent families.\nPeople are also reading…\nHowever, there are some positive changes. Compared to 2019, there were fewer teen births, fewer children without health insurance and fewer children and teen deaths.\nReality check\nBecause the information lags by two years in some cases, it may not accurately reflect the current state of data. For example, auto enrollment for Medicaid began during COVID but fell off in 2024. As a result, there is a chance the number of children without health insurance is much higher than what the data book is able to reflect.\nMicah Richardson, assistant director of policy for the Wyoming Women’s Association, said trying to determine whether there’ an expectation of seeing more kids in that category is “tricky.”\n“So it’s tricky to say because when we don’t have the data yet for the unwinding, and then two, we don’t know what the cuts look like yet at that federal level, so we’re kind of in this space of uncertainty.”\nHere's a quick look into health news as of late, including how potential Medicaid cuts could affect Wyoming and a matched fundraiser for Wyoming Rescue Mission.\nThe Wyoming Women’s Association is one of multiple foundations under the Wyoming Community Foundation, which is the state partner for the Annie E. Casey Foundation.\nRichardson noted that while Wyoming has the fewest kids in the nation living in high-poverty areas, it still has 19,000 children in poverty.\n“We look at that, and that is like such a great thing, and to think, ‘Boy, that’s something we should be happy about and celebrate.’ But then on the flip side of that there, if you look at the data again, in a different area, we still have 19,000 children in Wyoming living in poverty.”\nBetween 2019 and 2023, only 1% of Wyoming children lived in high-poverty areas, according to the report.\nData trends\nWhile comparing data to 2019 gives a broader look at how the state has changed, it is also important to note the trends do not always consistently go upward or downward.\nFor example, while Wyoming is still worse off in the number of children living in homes with a high housing cost burden than the state was in 2019, that number has dropped since last year’s data book.\nIn regards to child and teen deaths, there were 48 in Wyoming in 2023 which is better than the 51 in 2019, but it is also significantly better than the 58 in 2022.\nThe data fluctuates every year, and so does the state’s ranking as a result.\nLocal resources\nIn Natrona County, there are various food banks, shelters and other organizations working to help those who are at or below the federal poverty line.\nOne of those organizations is the Community Action Partnership of Natrona County. It provides healthcare for the homeless, emergency services, case management, housing readiness workshops and referrals for other programs in the area.\n“The KIDS COUNT indicators significantly influence the operations of the Community Action Partnership of Natrona County (CAPNC),” Kelly Wessels, executive director of CAPNC, wrote in an email to the Star-Tribune.\nWessels said if the data indicators on poverty continue to trend upward, it will create an increased demand for services while federal, state and local governments are projecting financial reductions in support.\nShe added that there could be issues with not having enough staff members to cover the needs of case management or in-depth support services. As a result, she said CAPNC would need to expand partnerships and push for more funding.\n“Although worsening indicators can help justify the need for more funding, obtaining it remains a competitive and time-consuming process,” Wessels wrote.\nAllison Allsop is the education and health reporter for the Casper Star-Tribune.

    "title": "Fritz contra Tiafoe, el duelo que EEUU llevaba 18 años esperando en el US Open - LA NACION",
    "text": "Con las ilusiones del país anfitrión sobre sus hombros, Taylor Fritz y Frances Tiafoe pugnarán el viernes por ser el primer tenista local en poner pie en la final masculina del Abierto de Estados Unidos desde 2006. El ganador podría medirse en la final del domingo con el italiano Jannik Sinner, número uno mundial, que jugará la segunda semifinal contra la gran promesa británica Jack Draper.\nEn un US Open lleno de giros inesperados, que alumbrará a nuevos campeones en ambas ramas, la gran revelación ha sido el tenis estadounidense, que no lucía a un total de cuatro semifinalistas en un torneo de Grand Slam desde 2003.\nJessica Pegula y Emma Navarro pelearán en las semifinales femeninas por el trono que dejó vacante la joya local, Coco Gauff, mientras que el choque entre Fritz y Tiafoe marca el florecimiento de la rama masculina que languidecía desde el ocaso de Andy Roddick, su última figura.\nRoddick, actual comentarista televisivo, fue el jugador que tomó el relevo de los íconos Pete Sampras y Andre Agassi y que dejó en casa el trofeo del US Open por última vez en 2003.\nTres años después el bombardero de Omaha fue el último finalista en Flushing Meadows, cayendo frente a Roger Federer.\nY también fue el genio suizo, invitado de honor el martes en la pista central, quien amargó a Roddick en las finales de Wimbledon de 2004, 2005 y 2009, la última ocasión en que un estadounidense pugnó por un trofeo de Grand Slam.\nMientras los tenistas estadounidense veían alejarse cada vez más la sombra de Roddick, sus compañeras sí festejaron múltiples triunfos en 'Majors' a cargo de las hermanas Venus y Serena Williams, Sloane Stephens, Sofia Kenin y Coco Gauff.\n- \"Jugar aquí es una locura\" -\nFritz y Tiafoe aspiran a ser quien termine con esa sequía en la final del domingo frente a los 23.000 aficionados de la mayor pista del mundo.\nLos dos semifinalistas, ambos de 26 años, son las raquetas que más han despuntado de la nueva generación estadounidense, nutrida en nombres pero sin ningún gran éxito que justifique la enorme inversión reciente del país en este deporte.\nDe los cinco integrantes del top-20 de la ATP que arrancaron el torneo, Fritz es el mejor posicionado (12º) y el único con un título importante en su vitrina, el Masters 1000 de Indian Wells en 2022.\nEn los Grand Slams, no obstante, se había estrellado cinco veces en los cuartos de final.\nEl martes, el espigado tenista californiano cruzó esa barrera con un formidable triunfo frente al alemán Alexander Zverev, número cuatro mundial, al que dejó frustrado por no aprovechar un cuadro del que Novak Djokovic y Carlos Alcaraz desaparecieron en las primeras rondas.\nTiafoe, de su lado, carece de trofeos destacados pero su figura se crece en Nueva York alimentada por una afición que disfruta como con nadie de su juego explosivo y su carisma.\n\"Nunca me hará más ilusión jugar en algún lugar que en Estados Unidos\", reconoció el número 20 mundial. \"Jugar aquí es una locura. Te emocionas tanto, es lo que veía de niño\".\nCon la experiencia de las semifinales de 2022, cuando cayó ante Alcaraz, el tenista afroamericano confía en sus posibilidades para un duelo entre dos jugadores con muy distintos inicios en el mundo del tenis.\nSi la madre de Fritz es la exjugadora Kathy May, cuartofinalista del US Open en 1978, Tiafoe es hijo de emigrantes de Sierra Leona y comenzó a jugar en un club de tenis de Maryland donde su padre trabajó como albañil y después como guardia.\n- El favorito y la revelación -\nLa otra semifinal del viernes medirá las fuerzas del principal candidato, Jannik Sinner, con las de la gran sensación del torneo, Jack Draper.\nEl británico, de 22 años, aprovechó a la perfección la temprana salida de Alcaraz para avanzar por ese lado del cuadro sin dejarse un solo set en el camino.\nDrapper es el primer semifinalista británico desde que Andy Murray, retirado el pasado mes, ganara su único trofeo de Nueva York en 2012.\nPara seguir soñando con igualar a su ídolo, Draper tendrá que tumbar a un Sinner que se está mostrando inexpugnable en el recorrido hacia su deseado primer trofeo del US Open y segundo de Grand Slam.\nEl italiano no ha mostrado un ápice de desconcentración por la enorme polémica que rodeó su llegada a Nueva York, cuando se destapó su doble positivo por clostebol de marzo del que fue absuelto por considerarse que fue involuntario.\nEn la pista, Sinner ha mantenido su gran momento de forma de este año, con triunfos en el Abierto de Australia y los Masters 1000 de Miami y Cincinnati.\nEn los cuartos dio cuenta del ruso Daniil Medvedev, el único excampeón que seguía vivo, en lo que muchos vieron como una final anticipada.\nGbv/gfe\nLA NACION Temas",

    "title": "Trauma and Truth: Native American Boarding Schools | Franciscan Media",
    "text": "Both the US government and the Catholic Church had a hand in the establishment and operation of Native American boarding schools, where, for nearly a century, thousands of children were sent without their parents’ consent. Now religious congregations across the country are finding out about their own involvement and working toward repairing shattered relationships with Indigenous communities. When I was growing up, I remember experiencing Indigenous culture firsthand and feeling so enriched and excited by it. For many years, my family has spent vacations in northern Ontario at a cabin along one of the many lakes that dot the Great Lakes region. Ultimately, it was love that brought my family in close contact with the Ojibwe people and culture: My oldest brother dated and later married a woman from the nearby Mississauga First Nation Indian Reserve (what would be called a reservation in the United States). The first powwow I attended was unforgettable. I remember hearing the sound of the pulsing drumbeat and traditional chants from the parking lot and being filled with wonder and even a bit of trepidation. At 11 years old, I was in for a deep plunge of cultural immersion that day, as I ate the food, listened to the swirling chants, and soaked in the colors of the traditional clothing worn by dancers in the powwow circle. Years later, on return trips up north, I started noticing signs along the highway that passes through two Ojibwe reserves, including my sister-in-law’s, on the way to our family cabin. Signs that read “Protect Our Children” and “Every Child Matters” alluded to something dark and sinister, but I wasn’t sure what was at the bottom of these messages. The more I read about the origin of these roadside signs, the more I found out how widespread and pernicious were the abuses that took place in Canada’s residential schools. As truth and reconciliation efforts have made strides in our neighbor to the north, more information has come to light about the reality here in the United States at what were called Native American (or Indian) boarding schools. That our Indigenous brothers and sisters suffered abuses at the boarding schools—some of which were Catholic-run—is a profound injustice in need of repair. Native communities, which have absorbed enormous intergenerational trauma, are currently walking the long road to healing. Thanks to their resilience and willingness to do the hard work of restorative justice with allies in the Church, though, there is hope for a brighter future. But before true healing can happen, it’s important to understand what caused this trauma and why it still has so much impact today. Not Ancient History In the 1880s, and under the guise of providing Native children with a proper education and instilling in them American values, the boarding school system took shape. After many were forced onto reservations, Native families sustained further trauma as children were taken from their parents without consent and often with the threat of violence or legal repercussions should they refuse. According to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition (NABS), 523 boarding schools operated at various times in the United States, and, by 1926, there were nearly 61,000 Native children in the schools, which existed in 38 states and impacted Alaskan and Hawaiian Indigenous peoples as well. That comes out to about 86 percent of all Native school-age children in the United States at the time. If this sounds like ancient history, consider the fact that the system of boarding schools continued through the 1960s. Legislation passed by Congress in 1978 finally put the power of consent back in the hands of parents. There were a number of ways that boarding schools set out to wipe Native identity from the minds and spirits of children, including cutting boys’ hair (which would typically only happen upon the death of a tribal elder), giving students Anglicized names, and prohibiting students from speaking their language or practicing their spirituality. Richard Henry Pratt, an American military officer and one of the early proponents of the boarding school system, once infamously summed up the government’s approach: “Kill the Indian, and save the man.” In 2021, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland (an Indigenous woman herself) launched a federal investigation, with the results revealing that physical, sexual, and emotional abuse were rife at these institutions. Officially, over 500 children died at various boarding schools in the United States, although that number is sure to grow as more research is done. Both marked and unmarked burial sites have been identified at 53 different schools. The report notes, “Federal records indicate that the United States viewed official disruption to the Indian family unit as part of Federal Indian policy to assimilate Indian children.” When collective trauma, stemming from actions such as the US government’s assimilation policy, continues to have a negative impact over time, it becomes intergenerational trauma. It’s often manifested in any number of social ills, from increased incidences of substance abuse to unemployment to suicide. According to the Centers for Disease Control, non-Hispanic Indigenous people die by suicide at a rate higher than any other racial or ethnic group. A 2020 American Community Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau, showed that one in three Native Americans lives in poverty, with a median income of $23,000. A Time to Listen But what does all of this have to do with the Catholic Church in America? Alongside efforts by NABS, an organization called Catholic Truth & Healing (https://ctah.ArchivistsACWR.org) has attempted to catalog all of the Catholic-run boarding schools, a daunting task. The group started compiling the list of schools in 2021, and though the current number of Catholic-run schools listed is 87, it’s expected to grow as more information comes to light. Congregations of Catholic women religious ran 74 of the Catholic boarding schools, and some of those groups are just now finding out about their involvement. The Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration (FSPA), located in La Crosse, Wisconsin, is one such group with ties to a boarding school and is still very much in the process of discovery, archiving, and working toward healing. A page on the FSPA website dedicated to truth and reconciliation states: “We’re studying our own history and impact at St. Mary’s Boarding School in Odanah, Wisconsin, from 1883 to 1969. Our hope is that we take action in dismantling systemic racism and White supremacy in ourselves and our areas of influence. Our intention is to address our complicity in unjust systems, both historically and now, and strive to enhance dignity and wholeness to those who have suffered for generations.” The congregation’s vice president, Sister Georgia Christensen, FSPA, is passionate about this justice issue and committed to the painful but essential process of healing. “Educating ourselves is the first step,” she says. “We’ve attended webinars and had book discussions. We’ve participated in powwows, and we’ve done two walks for missing and murdered Indigenous women [Known as MMIW walks, these events help to raise awareness.]. We provide justice training for our own people and, in fact, just completed a training session for 50 of our members and staff. It was very intense—a three-day workshop where we set up peace circles.” A major part of the education piece is deceivingly simple and not as easy as it sounds: listening. For a people whose history has been told largely by its colonizers, it’s incredibly important that the power to own and share their history be returned to them. To this end, the FSPA’s Truth and Healing Team has participated in listening sessions, where members of the Ho-Chunk and Chippewa/Ojibwe nations speak about the traumas experienced at St. Mary’s, as well as the effects of intergenerational trauma. The result of these listening sessions has been a positive step for both parties. “It’s relationship-building that is working toward providing us the opportunity to say we’re sorry and we want to do something that will work toward healing,” Sister Georgia says. “I think one of the biggest things for us is really to develop relationships. When we started our Truth and Healing Team, we had sisters, affiliates, partners in mission (our staff), and we had an Ojibwe member on the team.” The team has since expanded to include a member from the Ho-Chunk Nation, a man who Sister Georgia says has been “extremely helpful and challenging, which is exactly what we need.” Documenting a Collective Trauma Coupled with the education piece is the painstaking but crucial task of archiving the FSPA history with the St. Mary’s Boarding School. This is important work for the congregation’s own understanding of its past, but even more so for the Ojibwe and Ho-Chunk people. The archives have been opened and made available to them, which helps families track down information on their connection to St. Mary’s Boarding School. FSPA archivist Meg Paulino shares a particularly impactful moment that occurred as she was reading through some correspondence between the school and a Native American family. In the letters, she noticed that a 12-year-old boy had been sent back home to his family due to illness. A notice in a local newspaper reported that the boy had died, but the names didn’t match up. “I looked through all our record books and couldn’t find him there,” she says. Frustrated, Paulino dug deeper into the story. “Finally, I went to, of all things, FindaGrave.com,” Paulino recalls. “I just went deep into it. I was going to find this young man.” She discovered that the boy had a younger brother who was also at the boarding school. The records show that the younger brother remained at St. Mary’s after his brother was sent home. He would never see his older brother again. “This was one of the first times [working in the archives] I broke down crying,” says Paulino, who, being a mother of young boys herself, deeply related to this story. “This one really hit me hard, and it made me realize how important it is to help people find their ancestors and loved ones. It’s a very small part of my job in the archives, but I drop everything when it comes to finding out what happened to children such as this boy.” Paulino was able to share everything she found out with the boy’s family, giving them a sense of closure they wouldn’t have had otherwise. Along with sharing documents and correspondence with nearby Indigenous communities, the FSPA Truth and Healing team has returned cultural items and artifacts to the Bad River Chippewa Tribe in what was called a “repatriation ceremony.” Apologies Need Action Quickly offered, shallow apologies for egregious wrongs are commonplace today, which is something the FSPAs want to avoid. Educating themselves on and transparently documenting the FSPA history at St. Mary’s Boarding School must come before an apology. “It’s a learning process,” says Sister Georgia. “I think the apology gets woven into it. You don’t start with it.” As similar efforts are underway at numerous congregations and orders across the country to bring about justice and reconciliation, we, as Catholics and Americans, have to face up to what amounts to an act of genocide. Many of those who work closely on the issue of boarding schools in the United States watched intently as Pope Francis made what he called a “penitential pilgrimage” to Canada in 2022. In his address to a group of Indigenous leaders in Maskwacis, Alberta, he stated: “I am here because the first step of my penitential pilgrimage among you is that of again asking forgiveness, of telling you once more that I am deeply sorry. Sorry for the ways in which, regrettably, many Christians supported the colonizing mentality of the powers that oppressed the Indigenous peoples. I am sorry.” During his July 2022 visit to Maskwacis, Alberta, Pope Francis prays in front of a banner bearing the names of 4,120 Indigenous children and the residential school where they died. Truth and healing efforts are currently underway in the United States. As monumental as Pope Francis’ visit to Canada was, it set the stage for more work to be done. Finally, on March 30, 2023, the Vatican officially repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery, which for over 500 years had justified the colonization of Indigenous peoples, land seizures, and the myriad human rights abuses that followed. All but four of the Native American boarding schools in the United States have closed, and those that remain are firmly in the hands of the Indigenous people who run them and send their children there—this time, by choice. Unlike the Canadian government, which issued an official apology to Indigenous peoples and formed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2008, our own government has yet to do either. In fact, the word genocide is nowhere to be found in official reports, such as the Department of the Interior’s 2021 investigation. The work of the FSPA Truth and Healing Team, NABS, and many others helps ensure that, by studying and accepting the hard truths of history, we’re not doomed to repeat the same mistakes. For Sister Georgia, these efforts are deeply rooted in the Franciscan charism. “I see it as a part of simple, honest living and getting back to creation,” she says. “Trying to live the Gospel was what St. Francis tried to do, and I think that’s what we’re trying to do.” In their own ways, often unseen by many, these groups are continuing to respond to God’s directive to St. Francis at San Damiano: “Francis, go and repair my house, which, as you see, is falling into ruin.” Those on a mission to address our country’s sad history of Native American boarding schools are placing a stone back in the San Damiano Chapel and rebuilding God’s house. “Maybe it’s bigger than a stone,” says Sister Georgia. “It’s a huge effort.” Additional Resources • Information on the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration’s truth and healing efforts: [FSPA.org/content/ministries/justice-peace/truth-and-healing](https://www.fspa.org/content/ministries/justice-peace/truth-and-healing) • The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition: [BoardingSchoolHealing.org](https://boardingschoolhealing.org/) • “Healing with Our Indigenous Brothers and Sisters,” an article by Adrienne Castellon on Canada’s residential schools (St. Anthony Messenger, November/December 2023): [FranciscanMedia.org/st-anthony-messenger/healing-with-our-indigenous-brothers-and-sisters](https://www.franciscanmedia.org/st-anthony-messenger/healing-with-our-indigenous-brothers-and-sisters/) • The United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention (which includes its definition of genocide): [UN.org/en/GenocidePrevention](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/) • The US Conference of Catholic Bishops Subcommittee of Native American Affairs: [USCCB.org/committees/native-american-affairs](https://www.usccb.org/committees/native-american-affairs)",

    "text": "Le fabricant d’ordinateurs Dell a réduit ses effectifs de 25 000 personnes au cours des deux dernières années.

Cela signifie que l’entreprise technologique texane a réduit ses effectifs de 19 % depuis février 2023. des licenciements et des mesures incitant les employés à retourner au bureau ont été mis en place.\nEn août, l’entreprise a considérablement restructuré son service commercial, expliquant aux employés que cela était nécessaire pour se préparer au « monde de l’IA ». Dans le cadre de cette restructuration, dell a licencié du personnel, sans toutefois préciser le nombre de personnes concernées.\nL’entreprise a également mis en œuvre une série de mesures de retour au bureau tout au long de l’année 2024, encourageant progressivement les employés à revenir travailler sur site.

Plusieurs grandes entreprises technologiques, dont Meta, Alphabet et Salesforce, ont réduit leurs programmes et pratiques de reporting en matière de diversité, d’équité et d’inclusion, dans un contexte de réaction générale qui s’est intensifiée depuis l’entrée en fonction de l’administration Trump.\n« Chez Dell Technologies, nous pensons que des perspectives diversifiées sont très importantes », a déclaré l’entreprise. « Nous pensons qu’un personnel ayant des expériences et des antécédents différents favorise l’innovation et la croissance. »\nVoici les points clés à retenir :\n* Réduction des effectifs : Dell a réduit ses effectifs de 25 000 personnes en deux ans.\n* Retour au bureau : Une politique de retour au bureau a été mise en place, suscitant des réactions mitigées.* Restructuration : L’entreprise s’est restructurée pour se concentrer sur l’IA.\n* Engagement DEI : Dell réaffirme son engagement envers la diversité, l’équité et l’inclusion.\nDell : Analyse des Récents Changements et de Leur Impact Voici une analyse des récents changements chez Dell, ainsi qu’une section FAQ pour répondre aux questions courantes.\nRésumé des Principaux Points Dell a connu des changements significatifs ces dernières années,avec des impacts sur ses effectifs,sa structure organisationnelle et sa politique de travail.\nRéduction des effectifs : Diminution de 25 000 employés en deux ans.\nRestructuration : Accent mis sur l’IA, entraînant des licenciements et des réorganisations.\nPolitique de retour au bureau : introduction de nouvelles règles, avec des employés tenus de revenir travailler physiquement.\nImpacts financiers : Chute de l’action et baisse de la fortune du PDG.\n* Engagement DEI : Réaffirmation de l’engagement de Dell envers la diversité, l’équité et l’inclusion.\nTableau Récapitulatif | Aspect | Détail |\n| - | – |\n| Réduction des Effectifs | 25 000 employés en deux ans |\n| Effectif en Janvier 2025 | Environ 108 000 employés |\n| Chiffre d’affaires 2024 | Augmentation de 8% |\n| Baisse du Cours de l’action (2025) | 15% |\n| Baisse de la Fortune du PDG (2025) | 16,6 milliards de dollars |\n| Politique de télétravail | 50 % des employés US ont choisi le télétravail et renoncé aux promotions. |\n| Objectif de l’entreprise | Rationaliser et se concentrer sur l’IA. |\nFAQ Quelles sont les principales raisons de la réduction des effectifs chez Dell ?\nLa restructuration, l’accent mis sur l’IA et les mesures de rationalisation.\nQuelle est la politique de retour au bureau de Dell ?\nLes employés vivant à moins de 90 minutes d’un bureau sont tenus de revenir travailler cinq jours par semaine.\nComment les employés ont-ils réagi à la politique de retour au bureau ?\nCertains employés n’ont pas apprécié la politique, influençant certains à chercher d’autres emplois.\nQu’est-ce que Dell fait pour se préparer à l’ère de l’IA ?\nL’entreprise a restructuré son service commercial, entraînant des licenciements et une réorganisation.\nQuelle est la situation financière actuelle de Dell ?\nLe chiffre d’affaires a augmenté, mais le cours de l’action a baissé et la fortune du PDG a diminué.\nQuel est l’engagement de Dell en matière de diversité, d’équité et d’inclusion ?\nDell a réaffirmé son engagement envers ces valeurs.",
