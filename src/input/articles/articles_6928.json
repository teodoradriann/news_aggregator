    "title": "‘Pissed off’ Dak Prescott vows to be more accountable following Cowboys’ 2 consecutive losses",
    "text": "The\nDallas Cowboys have a new-found problem. Their winning streak has abruptly suffered a halt as the team has lost consecutive games in a row. The consecutive losses against the Buffalo Bills and the Miami Dolphins have questioned their team’s credibility. In addition, the losses can directly affect their chance of getting the No.1 seed in the NFC Conference. If the Cowboys fail to get the No.1 spot, then they will not be able to get the home game in the postseason.\nThe Cowboys have had a poor record on the road. They have been a monster at their home. With a stellar 7-0 record, they have demolished their opponents at home. However, away from home, they have suffered heavily. They only won three of their eight games.\nIn a recent interaction with the media,\nDak Prescott addressed the issue. He expressed his disgust regarding the entire scenario. He acknowledged that the situation was a bit frustrating for them.\nPrescott said:\nP*ssed for sure. But resilient, I guess, to answer that. And understanding that that one was close. Got away from us. Obviously on the road, could’ve been a good one, particularly saying the ‘road’ right against a playoff team. And just didn’t get it done. But it’s just been about for everybody to be accountable, look themselves in the mirror, say what more can I do individually and understanding if we do that, commit to that collectively we’ll continue to get better and we’ll get over this. No doubt about it.Dak Prescott to the reporters\nSkip Bayless calls Aaron Rodgers a ‘master media manipulator’ amid his return saga for the Jets\nDak Prescott feels that the Cowboys have to do more in the coming time\nThe Dallas Cowboys have two more games to go. In the next game, they will face the Detroit Lions. The Lions are another winning squad with a good record. The Cowboys have to win the game to add more security to their position in the postseason. Dak Prescott knows it pretty well.\nPrescott added:\nYeah for sure. I’d have to go back and take you through each play for the most part and even on good plays, there’s things that I felt like I could do better. That’s kind of the way I’ve always been. I know numbers, I know things kind of say I’m playing well and that, but to me a quarterback’s judged off wins and losses.Dak Prescott to the media\nPrescott tried his best against the Dolphins. He almost made it for the\nCowboys against the Dolphins. However, the latter clinched it at the last second.\nIn case you missed it:\nRyan Clark urges Mike Tomlin to move on from his role as the HC of the Pittsburgh Steelers Shannon Sharpe compares the Cowboys to one of his ex-girlfriends: “They look good, but I don’t trust them”\n- Do follow us on:\n- Follow FirstSportz on\nWhatsApp Channel Gerard Crispin",

    "text": "SHILLONG, Jan 5: An estimated 15 lakh domestic and foreign tourists visited Meghalaya in 2023, Tourism Minister Paul Lyngdoh said. The state government, which is according top priority to tourism for livelihood generation, described it as a big achievement. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony of a mural at the office building of East Khasi Hills district Deputy Commissioner on Friday, Lyngdoh said Meghalaya has a lot to offer to the rest of the world – cascading waterfalls, valleys, landscapes, rich tradition and culture and even the sky. He said each facet of nature has a rich history. He said the caves found in the state are one of the best. “If we consider the various assets, all we need to do to script a success story is to coordinate our efforts and work as a team,” Lyngdoh said. He further said that Meghalaya has reached a point where it is the next sought-after destination and if the state continues to sustain within the next few years, people will not look up to the government for employment. The making of the mural was supported by the Indian Foundation and the Asian Paints in collaboration with the state government. The mural, which portrays the theme of “Root and Rhythm” and is a testament to Mario Pathaw’s skill and creativity, adds a burst of colour and culture to the administrative hub. Lyngdoh expressed admiration for the artist’s work, emphasising the importance of promoting local talent to enhance the region’s cultural vibrancy. He said the mural has been carefully crafted to depict the essence of “Root and Rhythm” and it captures the spirit of Meghalaya’s cultural diversity. He said it not only serves as an aesthetic addition to the Deputy Commissioner’s office but also symbolises the harmony between tradition and contemporary expression. As Meghalaya continues to celebrate its cultural richness, an initiative like this reflects a collective effort to preserve and promote the unique artistic heritage of the region. The collaboration among Indian Foundation, Asian Paints and state government underscores a shared commitment to promoting and preserving the cultural heritage of the region. Deputy Commissioner RM Kurbah was among dignitaries present at the mural’s unveiling ceremony.
