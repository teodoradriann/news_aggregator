    "text": "高考很重要！非常重要！\n但它却并不是人生的终点，更不是衡量一个人价值的唯一标尺。\n这两天，各地的高考分数已经陆续可查了，在这个高考放榜季，注定是几家欢喜几家愁。\n有取得高分考上理想院校的学霸，全家人都会为他鼓掌喝彩庆祝。\n也有暂时失意，因未考出理想成绩而伤心难过的孩子。\n6月24号晚上，江苏的高考成绩可以查询了。\n沭阳的一个男孩怀着紧张而又期待的心情坐在电脑前，查询了自己的分数，本以为至少能考个500多分，可是结果却非常不尽人意，男孩只考了460分。\n众所周知，江苏高考的竞争一直以来都是十分激烈的，男孩的460分放到外省去其实还算可以了，但是在江苏却连本科都上不了。\n十二年的寒窗苦读、起早贪黑，刷过的题堆成山，熬过的夜数不清，所有的期盼和压力，在460这个分数出来的一刻，似乎都被否定了。\n这个成绩对男孩来说，非常的不理想，因为在高考前的三次模拟考试中，他都取得了500多分的成绩。\n如此的落差，让男孩再也忍不住，伤心的痛哭了起来。\n此时陪伴在孩子身边的妈妈，看着孩子伤心难过的样子，顿时也流下了心疼的泪水。\n而后来妈妈把此事分享出来，说出的一番话，更是直接引得一众网友纷纷泪目。\n妈妈说：看见孩子哭，我也没忍住，不是因为孩子考的分数低，而是心疼他这寒窗苦读的十二年，现在既然上不了本科，那咱们就上专科，毕竟没有人是因为高考而赢得了所有，也没有人会因为高考而输掉一切，只是做错了题而已，又不是做错了人，顶多算是榜上无名，又不是脚下没路，未来才是一幅画，我的阳光男孩加油，大不了我们在辛苦一年！\n妈妈的这番话，字字句句没有任何大道理，但却像一束光一样，穿透了孩子高考失意的阴霾。\n不得不说，这个妈妈真的是太清醒了。\n她没有把高考当成孩子人生的“生死劫”，她首先看到的是孩子在这背后的辛苦和付出。\n或许这份共情，才是孩子此时此刻最需要的理解。\n而妈妈的那句“只是做错了题，又不是做错了人，榜上无名，脚下有路”，也是把妈妈那非常正的价值观体现的淋漓尽致。\n是啊，试卷上的题目答错了，这只是知识掌握和临场发挥的问题，跟孩子的品格、能力和未来的潜力是没有任何关系的。\n人生的路有千万条，高考只不过是其中一条，考得好，是新的起点，考得不好，大不了换条别的路走，只要孩子三观正、不放弃、肯努力，即使换条路他也能走出属于自己的精彩和价值不是吗。\n看完妈妈说的这番话和孩子伤心落寞的样子，很多网友都被泪水给模糊了双眼。\n这些网友，大多都是感同身受，有过如此经历的家长，泪目的原因就是因为他们懂得这背后的辛酸与苦楚。\n评论区里，还有很多网友纷纷安慰起了孩子。\n大家都在告诉男孩不要灰心，无需自责，更不用懊悔，因为人生的路还长着呢，只要好好努力，好好运筹帷幄，同样可以走出辉煌。\n网友评论\n条条大路通罗马，关键看你怎么走！\n希望男孩能够快些整理好自己的心情，和妈妈一起，认真去规划脚下的路，重新出发。\n也希望所有家长和孩子都能够明白一个道理，就是高考的卷子会收上去，但人生的答卷，才刚刚开始书写而已。\n只要孩子肯上进、不轻言放弃、不停止前行，那么孩子的未来，仍然是有着无限的可能。\n对此，大家怎么看呢？\n声明：个人原创，仅供参考",

    "text": "A major bank in America has dropped its agenda to punish members of the Christian faith by \"debanking\" them. That's a process where a financial institution simply closes the accounts of a customer, sometimes a customer with years of established payment records with the bank. It is JPMorgan Chase that has rolled back a policy through which is already had punished multiple conservative individuals and nonprofits in recent years, according to a report from Fox News. The company now has confirmed changes that will make its WePay service available to those who earlier had been punished for allegedly violating the bank's demands to avoid \"social risk issues.\" Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! That, the bank demanded, was anything \"subject to allegation and impacts related to hate groups, systemic racism, sexual harassment and corporate culture.\" It is the ADF, a legal group that has fought multiple civil, constitutional and religious rights issues, that found out about the bank's decision to remove the restrictive language from its terms of service. The banking company said, in a statement to Fox News Digital, \"We support clients around the globe and in every state in the U.S., across industries, religions, and political affiliations.\" It wasn't always the case, the report suggested, citing an explanation from an ADF spokesman that, \"Chase has used this policy to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint. The policy itself is a risk to every single person who uses WePay and Chase, the biggest bank in America.\" The statement from the ADF lawyer continued, \"There's millions of people where it's a threat to them being denied or losing payment processing. So, it is significant that they eliminated that policy. The next step we think for Chase is because they've been saying, 'we're firmly committed to not discriminating against people on their religious or political views,' in different documents. That statement, we want them to put in their forward-facing customer policies. That's the next step.\" The history of the dispute includes the decision by Chase previously to cancel the banking of the National Committee for Religious Freedom, Fox reported. No explanation was offered. Fox reported, \"Another incident in 2021 involved WePay denying ticket-payment processing services for a Republican event hosted by a nonprofit organization, Defense of Liberty. The event featured Donald Trump, Jr., and WePay initially denied services by citing policies against providing services connected to 'hate … racial intolerance … or items or activities that encourage, promote, facilitate, or instruct others regarding the same.'\" The ADF now monitors banking companies for their reliance \"on divisive concepts\" like Critical Race Theory, and such. The issue also is facing Bank of America, which recently got a letter from 15 financial officers representing 13 states warning it overs its alleged decisions to politicize banking, and de-bank conservatives.

    "text": "Boeing Workers Vote to Strike, Impacting Production Plans [Thomas Cooper](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79604)Updated: 09-13-2024 12:51 AM Boeing Workers Prepare to Strike, Shaking Up Production Boeing is facing significant challenges as workers at its U.S. West Coast factories have voted to go on strike in a push for better wages. This important decision has raised concerns about halting the production of the company’s best-selling jet due to ongoing issues related to output delays and increasing debt. Workforce Mobilization and Unprecedented Actions This upcoming strike marks the first time Boeing's workforce has organized against the company since 2008. Set to commence at midnight Pacific Time, the effects of this labor action could ripple through the company as it seeks to regain stability. Workers have united to demand fair compensation, and their actions reflect broader sentiments regarding adequate pay amidst the pressures of rising living costs. Challenges Faced by Boeing The aerospace giant has encountered serious hurdles in recent years, including production delays that have affected numerous deliveries and the overall reputation of the company. These production setbacks are notably critical, as the 737 MAX model is one of Boeing’s flagship products, contributing significantly to its revenue. The new strike adds to these challenges at a time when the company is trying to reassure stakeholders. New Leadership at Boeing In a sign of hope, Boeing recently appointed Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO. His arrival in August has sparked expectations of renewed leadership focused on overcoming current issues. However, serious incidents, such as a door panel malfunction with a 737 MAX in January, have heightened scrutiny of the company's operational standards. true Importance of Employee Relations The actions taken by the workforce symbolize a pivotal moment for Boeing. As labor relations become more significant in the context of post-pandemic recovery, this strike could be a critical factor in reshaping the company's approach to employee engagement and operational transparency. Looking Ahead: Potential Implications Boeing’s strikes not only present immediate production implications but could also influence the aviation market significantly. Delays in the rollout of the 737 MAX could negatively impact airlines reliant on these aircraft for their operations, emphasizing the interconnectedness of labor relations with broader market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What prompted the Boeing workers to strike? The workers demanded higher wages and better working conditions due to ongoing delays and pressure related to their production responsibilities. When is the strike scheduled to begin? The strike is set to commence at midnight Pacific Time. How long has it been since the last strike at Boeing? This will be the first strike at Boeing since 2008. Who is the new CEO of Boeing? Boeing has appointed Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO to lead the company through its current challenges. What impact could the strike have on Boeing's operations? The strike could significantly halt the production of Boeing's 737 MAX jets and affect deliveries to airlines that rely on this model.

    "text": "It seems the time that wounds\ntake to heal is partly down to mentality: researchers have found that healing happens faster when the person involved thinks that time is progressing more quickly than it actually is.\nHarvard University psychologists Peter Aungle and Ellen Langer say their findings back up the idea of a two-way mind-body relationship, and that more consideration should be\ngiven to psychological factors when it comes to helping people recover from injury and illness.\nScientists are still trying to unpick the ways in which mental attitude\naffects physical health, but this is an eye-opening example carried out under lab conditions – and suggests the relationship between brain and body is broader than previously thought.\n\"Based on the theory of mind-body unity – which posits simultaneous and bidirectional influences of mind on body and body on mind – we hypothesized that wounds would heal faster or slower when perceived time was manipulated to be experienced as longer or shorter respectively,\"\nwrite the researchers in their published paper.\nFor the study, Aungle and Langer enlisted 33 participants, who each underwent a controlled\ncupping therapy process to leave bruising on the skin. This gave the researchers a minor wound that they could observe.\nThe volunteers were mildly wounded in this way three times: once in a Normal Time scenario lasting 28 minutes, once in a Slow Time scenario that lasted 28 minutes but was engineered to seem like 14 minutes (half as long), and once in a Fast Time scenario that lasted 28 minutes but was made to feel like 56 minutes (twice as long).\nTricks such as changing timer speeds, getting the participants to watch videos, and changing the frequency with which they were quizzed on their wounds were all used to help change\nthe perception of passing time.\n\"Although the actual elapsed time was 28 min in all three conditions, significantly more healing was observed in the Normal Time condition compared to the Slow Time condition, in the Fast Time condition compared to the Normal Time condition, and in the Fast Time condition compared to the Slow Time condition,\"\nwrite the authors.\nThis complicated relationship between the mind and the body has long fascinated researchers. It's part of the reason why placebos are\nstill used in experiments: sometimes just thinking you're undergoing treatment can have positive effects.\nBut while something like emotion is commonly understood to affect health (because\nstress can cause inflammation, for example), more abstract psychological factors – like the perception of time – are yet to be properly examined.\n\"These results support the hypothesis that the effect of time on physical healing is directly affected by one's psychological experience of time, independent of the actual elapsed time,\" Aungle and Langer\nconclude.\nThe research has been published in\nScientific Reports.",

    "title": "Boeing workers vote overwhelmingly to strike – Libération",
    "text": "Faced with financial and safety difficulties on its planes, the American aircraft manufacturer has seen its 33,000 workers massively reject a new agreement proposed by management. The strike begins this Friday, September 13 in the morning. Boeing workers in the Seattle area voted overwhelmingly to strike on Friday, rejecting a new contract offered by the troubled planemaker, their union said. Workers rejected the contract by 94.6 percent and voted Thursday night by 96 percent to strike, which begins this morning, said Jon Holden, president of the IAM-District 751 machinists union. “Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,” said Jon Holden, whose union, which represents about 33,000 workers in the Pacific Northwest, had initially supported the deal. The union leader had previously said he could not “to ensure that we get more by striking.” The strike will shut down two major aircraft assembly plants in the Puget Sound region — a two-thirds vote was needed to initiate a work stoppage when the current 16-year-old contract expires Thursday night. It will paralyze production of the 737, 777 and 767 freighter, whose deliveries are already accumulating delays. A situation that is all the more problematic since the aircraft manufacturer collects the largest part of the payment (around 60%) when the planes are handed over. According to TD Cowen analysts, a fifty-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 to $3.5 billion in cash and would have an impact of $5.5 billion on turnover. Thursday’s vote marked a decisive rejection of a deal that workers said was far less generous than Boeing executives had claimed. The new contract, which covers IAM members in the Seattle area, included a 25 percent wage increase over four years and a commitment to invest in the region. It also called for the next plane to be built in the planemaker’s historic homeland, which was expected to provide jobs for decades to come. “We were sold off” Boeing, which reacted to the announcement of the strike by saying “engaged” in the negotiations, hoped that these concessions would be enough to dodge it. Its financial situation has been precarious since the crash of two 737 Max 8s in 2018 and 2019, which cost the lives of 346 people, and a multitude of production quality problems. “It’s no secret that our business is going through a difficult time, partly because of our own past mistakes. […] A strike would jeopardize our common recovery,” Kelly Ortberg, who succeeded Dave Calhoun as CEO of the American aircraft manufacturer on August 8, warned on Wednesday evening. He had urged employees not to “sacrifice” future progress due to “frustrations related to the past”But the disgruntled consider the salary increase too far removed from the union’s demands (+40% initially) and the section on pensions unsatisfactory. A week after taking office, Kelly Ortberg pledged to “reset” the relationship with the IAM. But upon reading the agreement, many union members reacted negatively and called for a work stoppage. “We were sold off,” Kamie Bryan, a Boeing employee for eighteen years, told AFP on Thursday after voting against the agreement and for the strike. “We should not take these few pennies they give us and be grateful,” she noted, emphasizing the scale of the “boss’ income”. $250 per week for strikers Televisions showed daily rallies of workers protesting in factories against wage measures that they consider inadequate in the face of inflation. After strikes in the automobile, entertainment and other sectors of activity, the unions are thus engaged in a new showdown. The IAM rules provide that strikers receive $250 per week starting in the third week of work stoppage. Boeing has been under increased scrutiny since an in-flight incident in early January involving an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 that followed a series of compliance and quality control issues and revived questions about the same deficiencies raised after the two crashes. The last strike at the American planemaker was in 2008 and lasted 57 days.",

    "text": "Wisconsin's job market finishes the year on a strong note with record high number of people working [Ricardo Torres](https://www.jsonline.com/staff/4488660002/ricardo-torres/) Wisconsin’s economy ended 2023 in good shape with businesses hiring workers and the state’s unemployment rate at 3.3%, lower than the national average of 3.7%. Jobs and employment data is still being gathered for December. However officials with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development said that in November the state had more than 3 million people working, which is a new high for the state, and in the month 1,700 employees were added to the workforce. In 2023, roughly 32,300 workers entered the workforce in Wisconsin. The biggest problem with the economy has been there aren’t enough bodies to fill the openings. “As the Baby Boomers age out, we find that we need more and more workers just in general,” said Scott Hodek, Section Chief for DWD's Office of Economic Advisors, “This is the big piece that we’re seeing influence the workforce and the economy into the next decades.” More: [These 6 companies laid people off in November in Wisconsin](/story/money/business/2023/12/01/these-6-companies-laid-people-off-in-november-2023-in-wisconsin/71679124007/) Hodek made his comments during the department’s virtual economic briefing in December. “Students, right now graduating, have a great job market,” Hodek said. “We saw we’re getting more people into the labor force, and that’s good, but we need more.” And while the job market is in workers favor, there might be some signs of hiring slowing down. According to the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association and Commerce's most recent data from October, Milwaukee metro area employment averaged 862,000, a 0.3% increase from one year ago. “A weakened overall employment trend, as well as negative manufacturing and unemployment indicators, suggest a sluggish metro area economy,” Bret Mayborne, MMAC vice president of economic research, said in the monthly report. “On the positive side, local housing and real estate indicators may be on the mend after registering declines for the better part of two years.” There are still some workers who received bad news this year. In December only one employer filed a WARN notice with the state: Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc., based in Brookfield, informed 17 remote workers that they would be laid off beginning Feb. 16. In 2023, 6,727 workers learned they would need to find a new job, which is up from 5,563 a year ago, and up from 2,888 in 2021. But that annual number is a fraction of the 39,756 workers that were laid off in 2020.",

    "title": "What are Palestine’s unique Christmas rituals, disrupted by Israel’s war? – DNyuz",
    "text": "Through carols, cookies and Christmas lights, December 25 is marked by jubilation and celebration of the birth of Jesus for more than 2 billion Christians worldwide.\nHowever, a silent night falls on the 50,000 Christians in Palestine – a number that is in rapid decline.\nThe safety of Christians in Palestine was shaken by the bombardment of Gaza’s oldest Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Porphyrius in October, which killed at least 18 people including children. Israeli forces also shot and killed an elderly Christian mother and her daughter in a Catholic church in Gaza on Saturday.\nThis year, the many gleeful rituals that characterise Christmas in Palestine will be replaced by simpler ceremonies, mourning and prayer, shining a harsh light on the current reality of the region. The Lutheran Church, for instance, has the Baby Jesus in a manger of rubble and destruction.\nWas Jesus Palestinian?\nMany Christian schools of thought believe that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the now Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n“Jesus was born on our side of the wall ,” Palestinian pastor Reverend Munther Isaac told Al Jazeera.\nIsaac added that the narrative of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem is backed by archaeology as well as scripture such as Luke’s Gospel.\n“It’s the year 2023, and you’ve got, on Christmas day, all over the world, millions of, so many, hundreds of millions, if not more, of Christians going to church, reading about Bethlehem, singing about Bethlehem and thinking maybe of Bethlehem as a mythical place, as a fairytale, not realising it’s a real place with people, with a Christian community that has kept the tradition alive for 2,000 years.” What is the story of Christmas?\n“While the family of Jesus lived in Nazareth back then, they travelled from Nazareth to Bethlehem for that [census] registration,” Isaac narrated, with thoughtful pauses between his sentences.\nIsaac drew parallels between the story of the birth of Jesus and the current situation in Palestine.\n“We’ve always been under empires. We’ve always been displaced,” said Isaac, explaining that Jesus was born when Palestine was under the Roman empire.\nAn imperial decree of the empire ordered the family of Jesus to register for the census in Bethlehem, added Reverend Mitri Raheb, another Palestinian pastor from Bethlehem. King Herod ordered the massacre of infant boys, leading to the family of Jesus escaping to Egypt as refugees, explained Isaac.\nAccording to the Bible, Jesus was born in Bethlehem and then placed in a manger. The Church of Nativity was built at this location and its grotto holds great religious significance, pulling Christians from all over the world into the city of Bethlehem every Christmas. The procession of the patriarchs\nOne of the most important Christmas rituals in Palestine is the procession of the patriarch from Jerusalem. This procession takes place on December 24 for Catholics and January 6 for Orthodox patriarchs.\nThe designated procession route that has been followed throughout the Ottoman Empire and the British mandate is now engraved in tradition, Isaac explained. The patriarch is received from Jerusalem in Bethlehem and then the procession walks through the streets of the old town in Bethlehem until it reaches the Church of Nativity, where prayers are held.\nIsraeli authorities and Palestinian police escort the procession, depending on the territory the procession passes through.\nThe arrival of the procession is a celebrated festivity, welcomed by several scout groups and musical bands from all over Palestine. People leave their homes to walk around the city and witness the spirit of Christmas.\nThis year, the bands and scouts will not be present, instead, the procession will be silent. Midnight mass and Manger Square\nOnce the procession reaches the church, prayers begin at 5pm local time and last until midnight, with the midnight mass being broadcast for the world to see, Raheb said.\nThe Manger Square in Bethlehem is also decorated with a large Christmas tree and performances are held there. This year, there is no Christmas tree at Manger Square. Instead, “the civil society and some artists are working on a new kind of crib that is made out of rubble as a sign to what’s happening in Gaza”, said Raheb. He added that a video will be screened on the wall of the Nativity Church, showing what is happening in Gaza. Shopping, gatherings and Ma’amoul\nAs a child, Isaac would excitedly visit Jerusalem with his parents for Christmas shopping. Several markets sell festive clothes and decorations for the holiday season. It is a tradition to buy the best clothes from Jerusalem and save them for Christmas.\n“You know how in America you go to a big mall? We used to go to Jerusalem. We can’t any more,” Isaac said, alluding to the stringent permit rules in the region, which constrict the mobility of Palestinians.\nChristmas is a time when families meet, in Palestine and elsewhere. While family could mean a small group of immediate relatives in the West, “When I say ‘family’ in Bethlehem, I say all 200 or so members of the Isaac family in our town – the clan,” said Isaac.\nAfter an initial large gathering of all family members, individual homes are visited. Feasts of rice and meat are enjoyed and homemade desserts and delicacies are exchanged. These include ka’ek, or ma’amoul – semolina shortbread cookies filled with dates or nuts.\nLarge Christmas trees are a cynosure in every church, where parties and banquets are organised. This year, the parties have been cancelled and “no one is in the mood to … decorate a Christmas tree”, Isaac said. Do Muslims celebrate Christmas in Palestine?\nIsaac explained that Christmas is a national holiday for all Palestinians, not just a Christian holiday. The Palestinian Authority considers it a national holiday and government offices are typically closed on Christmas day.\nSeveral Palestinian Muslims visit Bethlehem on Christmas to attend the parade and take pictures with the Christmas tree.\n“Jesus was from Bethlehem, after all. And this means a lot to us as Palestinians,” said Isaac.\nThe post What are Palestine’s unique Christmas rituals, disrupted by Israel’s war? appeared first on Al Jazeera .",
