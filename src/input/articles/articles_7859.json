Como homenaje a las madres, cada jugadora fue nombrada por su nombre y sus dos apellidos mientras la afición vitoreaba a cada una de ellas llegando al punto álgido cuando Jennifer Hermoso, con el trofeo en mano, entro al escenario con los aplausos y ánimos de la grada que se cayó a bajo a grito de \"¡Jenni, Jenni!\". Otra de las más aclamadas fue Aitana Bonmatí, MVP de la Final a Cuatro. La fiesta, que comenzó a las 17.00 horas con entrada libre hasta que se completó el aforo y contó con música en directo de grandes artistas invitados como Marlena, en dos ocasiones, Michenlo, Delaporte y Elena Farga, tuvo su punto álgido cuando entraron las jugadoras y el cuerpo técnico alrededor de las 19.00 horas y se cerró con el We are the Champions como es habitual en este tipo de acontecimientos. 🎤 𝗯𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗮 con la colaboración entre— RFEF (@rfef) [@marlenaoficial]y [@Jennihermoso]🤣 📺 Síguelo en [https://t.co/fYiXcuLlfw] [#JugarLucharYGanar]I [#UWNL] [pic.twitter.com/GGpU7k0U5m] [February 29, 2024] En la mañana de este jueves, la selección fue recibida por la presidenta del Congreso, junto a los portavoces de los grupos, en el Salón de los Pasos Perdidos, desde el que se trasladaron al hemiciclo, donde ocuparon los escaños y se fotografiaron con los diputados presentes.

    "text": "A Butler pastor previously accused of sexually assaulting two underage girls was charged last week with misdemeanor indecent assault of a female congregant he offered to mentor through a theology program, according to police documents. Charging documents acquired Thursday said Herman Rushing, pastor of By His Grace Christian Ministries, assaulted the woman in the office of the church after working on a packet meant to prepare her for ministry school.\nRushing, 67, is accused of touching the woman without her consent, grabbing her face and attempting to kiss her.\nThe victim disclosed to state police Rushing began rubbing her shoulders and kissing her neck while working on the packet. As she attempted to move away from him and jumped up, Rushing blocked her from the door.\nAs Rushing blocked the door, the victim said she “froze,” according to police. Rushing then groped her, grabbed her face and attempted to kiss her. The victim stated she pulled away from Rushing and was able to leave the building.\nThe woman told police Rushing told her he was chosen by God to minister.\nRushing also faces charges for allegedly assaulting two girls under the age of 16 on multiple occasions.\nHe is accused of assaulting a 13-year-old girl over the span of several years, beginning when she was 10 years old.\nA 16-year-old girl also disclosed Rushing had touched her inappropriately over the past year, police said, citing two instances that took place in his home.\nRushing was charged earlier this month with felonies and misdemeanors of indecent assault, corruption of minors and child endangerment and placed in Butler County Prison in lieu of $75,000 bail, which was reduced to $50,000 after he waived his preliminary hearing Dec. 21 before District Judge Kevin O’Donnell.

This is good for the residents and good for the city of Sderot, that way it will be possible to move it.\"\nThe Home Front Command's announcement, about changing the defense policy in the surrounding settlements, caught some of the residents off guard.\nSome of them have already returned to their homes, some are in transit and the rest are still waiting to see where the war will go.\n\"It seems a little strange to me that the Home Front Command issues announcements by surprise without preparing the authorities,\" said Moran Hajabi, a resident of Yachini, after receiving the news.\n\"They are creating confusion among the residents, the authorities are trying to prepare the infrastructure in front of the residents, and the Home Front Command comes and flashes a message that conveys instability.\"\nA destroyed house in Kibbutz Bari, January 1, 2023/Uri Sela\nThe security establishment understands that despite the changes in the defense policy, opening the education system in the surrounding settlements, in the shadow of the continuation of the fighting, is a challenge.\nArmy officials claimed that the changes were made in coordination with the authorities: \"There are settlements that have already returned, and some of the solutions were given within the kibbutzim. There are additional kibbutzim that want to return.\"\nBeyond the question of security, the residents of the enclave also face the psychological impact of living in a combat zone.\nThe army emphasized: \"We said that from a security point of view it is possible to return, the decision is ultimately up to the individual, the family and the community. Just as there are families who do not want to return for the sake of the mental security of the children, there are many families who want to return. Last Friday, Or Haner voted in the kibbutz and decided that the kibbutz is returning The communities that decided to return must open the schools.\"\nKibbutz Nahal Oz destroyed after the terrorist attack by Hamas.\nOctober 20, 2023./Flash 90, Jonathan Zindel\ndo not miss\nBiden signed an unprecedented presidential order against settlers who attack Palestinians\nBen Gvir has introduced a spirit into the police force - and it is evil and dangerous\nReport: A gunman is holding hostages in a factory in Turkey - in protest of the war in Gaza\nUncompromising sex life - \"It saved my sex and relationship\"\nTherefore, it seems that the residents of the Otaf are still studying the decision made by the Home Front Command and the Southern Command and the feelings are mixed.\n\"If the state is able to allow to return and not by force - then excellent,\" said Yaron Samimi of Shukda.\n\"People need to be given the time and the options. It is impossible to return residents without educational institutions. And those who are not yet ready to return should be given the option.\"\nOn the other hand, there are also those who think that the return to the surrounding settlements is still premature.\n\"I'm in favor of giving the residents the option to return, but they also need to be synchronized,\" said one of the heads of the authorities in Otef who chose to remain anonymous.\n\"There are several plans of the army, of Takuma and more, but not all the state bodies are synchronized. The state must allow those who started the school year outside the envelope to finish. There are still noises of war here.

    "text": "New Year’s Eve is already a perilous night for motorists, and winter weather could make the next few days even more difficult for travelers in some parts of the U.S.\nCar crash fatalities jump on New Year’s Eve, largely attributed to drunk driving accidents, and although the forecast is mostly clear, poor weather conditions this year could contribute to hazardous road conditions for holiday travelers in some areas.\nMultiple states faced hazardous holiday travel over Christmas when a blustery winter storm brought blizzard conditions to Nebraska and South Dakota. The storm has moved eastward, with 12 states expecting snow over the weekend , including multiple states in the Midwest, northern Alabama and Georgia, and New York and Maine, as well as Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.\nHowever, much of the snow was expected to fall on Friday and Saturday, leaving Sunday through Tuesday mostly clear for travelers, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n“The outlook is rosy for most travelers at the start of 2024. A sprawling area of high pressure will keep most of the country dry,” an NOAA report said Tuesday. “High temperatures are expected to be near or above average for much of the country through the first half of next week as Arctic air stays bottled up to the north.”\nHowever, the snow in northern Maine from Saturday may have “lingering effects” that “could impact travel into the New Year,” NOAA public affairs specialist and meteorologist Erica Grow Cei told Newsweek , although major interstates in the region are unlikely to have any weather-related issues. She added that snow showers enhanced by the lake effect are likely for the Midwest on Sunday, with an inch of snow forecast in the Great Lakes region and 2 to 4 inches predicted in upstate New York and northern Wisconsin.\nThe NOAA report added that precipitation will be scarce, although showers are possible on Monday from the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern and central Appalachian mountains.\n“Some snow is possible in higher mountain elevations, but since there’s not much cold air in place, the majority of precipitation is likely to fall as rain. Looking ahead to Tuesday, the outlook is dry for most folks traveling east of the Rockies,” the report said.\nRain showers are expected along the West Coast on Monday, with a threat of snow in the Cascades and the northern Sierras.\n“However, the impact on travel should be low, as the snow is likely confined to elevations above the mountain passes and major interstates,” NOAA reported.\nMeanwhile, air travel could be interrupted by a low ceiling on Monday and Tuesday in and out of Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n“January 2nd could also be gusty at airport hubs along the East Coast, including Atlanta, Washington DC, and New York City,” the report said.\nMore motorists are impacted by winter weather in the days leading up to the new year, with the National Weather Service issuing weather advisories for five states on Friday. Parts of Alaska, California, Maine, Nevada and Tennessee will be impacted by high wind, as well as snow and freezing rain that could reduce visibility in the early part of the weekend.\nUncommon Knowledge\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nThe post How Winter Weather Could Impede New Year’s Travel appeared first on Newsweek .",

    "title": "La iglesia más antigua del mundo, refugio de papas y reliquias, cumple 1,700 años - El Nuevo Día",
    "text": "La Archibasílica fue la primera iglesia abierta por el emperador Constantino tras la persecución de los cristianos durante más de dos siglos 31 de mayo de 2024 - 7:37 AM La Archibasílica fue la primera iglesia abierta por el emperador Constantino tras la persecución de los cristianos durante más de dos siglos 31 de mayo de 2024 - 7:37 AM Roma — La Basílica de San Juan de Letrán, cuyos muros han resguardado a 233 papas, han visto caer el Imperio Romano, han sobrevivido a atentados, bombardeos y saqueos y guardan en su interior reliquias de enorme valor para la tradición cristiana, cumple 1,700 años como la iglesia más antigua del mundo. La “madre y guía” de todas las iglesias es la sede del obispo de [Roma](https://www.elnuevodia.com/topicos/roma/), el Papa, y por ello la de mayor rango entre las cuatro basílicas mayores de la capital italiana, las que cualquier peregrino que se precie debe visitar para obtener el perdón, además de una fuente inagotable de riqueza artística con la impronta de su larguísima historia. La Archibasílica del Santísimo Salvador del Mundo y de los Santos Juan Bautista y Juan Evangelista -su nombre completo- fue “la primera iglesia abierta al pueblo de Dios por el emperador Constantino tras la persecución” de los cristianos durante más de dos siglos, explica a EFE el sacerdote Marco Frisina, director del coro de la Diócesis de Roma que canta en las celebraciones de la basílica. Gracias a Constantino, que convirtió el cristianismo en la religión oficial del Imperio, los cristianos abandonaron la clandestinidad y gozaron de su primer lugar público para rezar, consagrado en el año 324 por el papa san Silvestre. Hoy aún se respira su fuerte conexión con la Antigua Roma: desde la imponente puerta de bronce proveniente de la ‘Curia Giulia’, el Senado romano, a su propio nombre, Letrán, el de una noble familia romana caída en desgracia durante el mandato de Nerón (37-68 d.C). Hasta el siglo XIV, cuando la sede del papado se trasladó a la localidad francesa de Aviñón, San Juan fue el corazón de la cristiandad, la residencia del papa en el Palacio Lateranense, hoy la sede de la Diócesis de Roma. Además del templo, el recinto se completa con el imponente claustro de Pietro Vassaleto del siglo XIII y el baptisterio, el primero de forma octogonal y guía para los posteriores, como el de Florencia, construyendo así un puente artístico de la Antigua Roma al Barroco, pasando por el Renacimiento. El secreto para seguir en pie durante 1,700 años reside en el uso de “unos materiales extraordinarios” y en que antes “todo se hacía sin prisa, para la eternidad”, sin olvidar que “siempre ha habido un trabajo de restauración y protección. Esta catedral siempre ha estado custodiada, salvo durante el período de Aviñón”, sostiene Frisina. Centro neurálgico del cristianismo durante siglos, San Juan de Letrán guarda infinidad de valiosas reliquias reunidas en el “Tesoro del Sancta Sanctorum”, en la que fuera la capilla privada de los papas hasta el Renacimiento. Como la ‘Escalera Santa’, los peldaños del Pretorio de Jerusalén que, según la tradición, subió Jesús de Nazaret para su proceso y que fueron traídos a Roma por santa Elena, la madre del emperador Constantino, y que cientos de fieles suben cada día de rodillas como penitencia. También el icono “aquiropoeta”, una imagen de Jesucristo pintada sobre una tabla que la tradición asegura que no fue creada por la mano humana, así como una tabla sobre la que San Pedro ofició la primera ‘misa’ o parte de la mesa en la que se celebró la Última Cena. Durante sus 1,700 años de vida la archibasílica ha sobrevivido a numerosas vicisitudes que han amenazado su supervivencia y que agrandan la épica que rodea a la catedral de Roma. En su larga historia, Roma sufrió infinidad de saqueos que también afectaron a la basílica lateranense por parte de galos, visigodos, bárbaros, germanos e incluso el perpetrado en 1527 por el ejército imperial de Carlos I de España y V de Alemania. Pero también ha visto cómo las casi 10,000 bombas lanzadas durante la II Guerra Mundial causaron más de un millar de muertos en la Ciudad Eterna, o como un coche bomba colocado muy cerca del templo por la mafia siciliana Cosa Nostra provocó casi una decena de heridos. Las celebraciones por el 1,700 aniversario devolverán a esta iglesia parte de su esplendor, “como una señora que va a ponerse guapa para una fiesta”, dice Frisina, y se espera que a finales de año el papa abra su Puerta Santa para el Jubileo de 2025, el último por ahora de los eventos de un lugar por el que no parece pasar el tiempo.

    "text": "Au Brésil, de nouvelles pluies diluviennes se sont abattues dans le sud du pays.Les intempéries ont déjà fait plus de 100 morts, 130 personnes sont portées disparues.Des opérations de secours ont dû être interrompues à cause de la montée des eaux. L'image est saisissante. Pendant plus de 24 heures, un cheval nommé Caramel, est resté perché en équilibre sur un toit, au milieu d'un quartier sous les eaux comme le montre la vidéo du 20H de TF1 en tête de cet article. Il aura fallu l'intervention de vétérinaires pour secourir l'animal. À l'aéroport de Porto Alegre au Brésil, les vols sont annulés car les pistes ont disparu. Et la pelouse du stade s'apparente à une piscine de boue. Lire aussi Brésil : les inondations sans précédent dans le sud du pays font au moins 100 morts et 374 blessés Un homme a failli se noyer, il doit sa vie à une grille. \"J'étais effrayé, mais j'ai essayé de me calmer. Je n'avais pas pied, et si je paniquais, ça allait être pire\", raconte-t-il encore sous le choc. Des évacuations ont été effectuées toute la journée de mercredi, en plein centre-ville, que ce soit avec les blindés de l'armée, en tracteur ou à jet ski à la force des bras. L'opération s'est réalisée dans l'odeur infecte de l'eau stagnante. Plus de 160.000 personnes ont fui là où elles le peuvent vers les hauteurs, quitte à dormir sur les autoroutes. \"Au moins, c'est haut ici, il n'y a pas d'eau, le seul problème c'est la pluie\", témoigne un sinistré. Dans ces inondations, 107 personnes sont mortes et plus d'une centaine sont toujours portées disparues.",

    "text": "VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / February 27, 2025 / Onco-Innovations Limited (CSE: ONCO )(OTCQB: ONNVF )(Frankfurt: W1H ,WKN: A3EKSZ ) (\" Onco \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to provide information regarding its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inka Health (\"Inka\"), which has made significant strides in advancing AI-driven oncology research by leading a transformative study protocol 1 published in medRxiv in September 2024 , focused on AI-generated synthetic patient models. This innovative research aims to advance the study of oncology by creating synthetic patient data, thereby leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to overcome critical challenges, particularly in the study of rare cancers where traditional patient data is often unavailable or difficult to obtain.\nThe study, entitled, \" External Control Arm with Synthetic Real-world Data for Comparative Oncology using Single Trial Arm Evidence (ECLIPSE): A Case Study using Lung-MAP S1400I \" is led by Dr. Winson Cheung, Medical Advisor at Inka Health and Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary, and brought together an esteemed team of oncology experts, including Inka Health co-founders Dr. Paul Arora and Dr. Alind Gupta, along with a consortium of world-renowned cancer researchers and private sector partners (Subsalt and Quantify Health). This exciting initiative seeks to develop synthetic patient cohorts using AI technology, a core element of digital twin technology, to address gaps in oncology research and accelerate clinical trial design by quickly generating comparator arms for trials. The Company believes that this is particularly critical in the rare cancer setting where randomizing patients to control arms (comparison groups without the new treatment) 2 is often infeasible. Ultimately, this approach aims to improve the pace and effectiveness of cancer treatments.\nThis study, led by Inka Health, has the potential to impact not only Onco-Innovation's cancer research but also the broader healthcare landscape by providing a scalable, data-driven solution to the challenges of studying rare and hard-to-treat cancers. As part of this ongoing initiative, Inka is working to expand its proprietary AI-driven platform, SynoGraph, which enhances patient stratification, improves clinical trial efficiency, and advances precision oncology solutions. By incorporating synthetic real-world data, SynoGraph aims to offer the pharmaceutical and biotech industries a powerful tool to speed up drug development and regulatory processes.\n\" The ability to create synthetic patient models using AI is an exciting milestone for oncology research. Traditional data limitations have long hindered progress, especially for rare cancers where patient data is scarce. With this technology, we can simulate diverse patient populations, with the potential to improve how clinical trials are designed, \" said Paul Arora, CEO of Inka Health.\n\"AI-driven synthetic patient models represent a potentially major leap in oncology research. By generating high-fidelity digital replicas of real patients, we can overcome data gaps that have historically slowed advancements, particularly for rare cancers and underrepresented populations. This approach has the potential to enhance clinical trial design, optimize treatment strategies, and accelerate the development of life-saving therapies, \" said Winson Cheung, Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary and Medical Advisor at Inka Health.\nAbout Onco-Innovations Limited\nOnco-Innovations is a Canadian-based company dedicated to cancer research and treatment, specializing in oncology. Onco's mission is to prevent and cure cancer through pioneering research and innovative solutions.
