    "title": "Renewable electricity to outstrip coal next year: IEA - Breitbart",
    "text": "The amount of electricity produced from renewable sources worldwide is set to surpass output from coal-fired plants for the first time in 2025, the International Energy Agency said Friday. The forecast comes as electricity demand is set to rise four percent this year and next, up from 2.5 percent in 2023. That would be the highest annual growth since 2007, excepting spikes seen after the global financial crisis that began that year and during the Covid-19 recovery, the Paris-based agency said. Soaring demand reflects “the growing role of electricity in our economies as well as the impacts of severe heatwaves,” said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security. Hydroelectric, solar, wind and other renewable sources are forecast to provide 35 percent of global supply next year, up from 30 percent in 2023, the agency said. Solar alone is set to supply half the demand growth through 2025, with wind a further 25 percent. Coal use is not expected to decline, however, as electricity use soars in China and India in particular, the IEA said. Heatwaves across India are expected to lift electricity demand in the country by eight percent this year, while China’s demand is expected to grow six percent. European demand is set to climb 1.7 percent. In the United States, where mild weather saw demand decrease last year, electricity use is set to rise three percent this year — not least as the development of artificial intelligence spurs the creation of massive data centres. “It’s encouraging to see clean energy’s share of the electricity mix continuing to rise, but this needs to happen at a much faster rate to meet international energy and climate goals,” Sadamori said in a statement. He also urged officials to impose higher energy efficiency standards “to reduce the impacts of increased cooling demand on power systems”.",

    "text": "As more and more people are looking for more affordable and sustainable ways of living, the popularity of tiny houses has skyrocketed. Along with the higher demand for living small, tiny homes have also been steadily getting bigger and more luxurious, moving away from their origins. However, there are still builders who focus on crafting small dwellings that capture the essence of tiny living. One of them is North Carolina-based Tiny House Listings, a company that also operates a marketplace for buying and selling compact houses. Their newest model called the Overlook, is a pint-sized In a society where everything gets bigger, faster, and more expensive, and over-consumption often dominates our lifestyles, tiny houses represent a refreshing alternative, allowing people to slow down and reconsider their priorities. The tiny living movement is all about taking up less space, reducing your carbon footprint, spending less on bills, and living more intentionally in a closer connection with nature. This is what the Overlook promises its future owners—the possibility of living as simply, efficiently, and intentionally as possible in a very. This mini-home offers a delicate balance between beautiful aesthetics and functional efficiency while retaining most of the features that have made tiny houses a viable alternative to traditional housing. Some notable features on the outside include a cantilevered bump-out at the rear, which expands the lofted area, and a huge 2-foot tall by 6-foot wide window right beneath it that offers those inside beautiful views. The designers also added a light under the bump-out so you can use the space for outdoor living. The 192 square feet of livable space inside this home integrates all the basic necessities for one person to live comfortably, demonstrating that downsizing your lifestyle doesn't just mean choosing to live in less space but rather in a more efficient space. Using the principles of Scandinavian design and showing a deep understanding of space dynamics, the builders managed to create a living space that feels inviting, comfortable, and practical. In addition, the designers used some well-known tricks to make the space feel more open and commodious. The white walls and large windows in the main living area invite plenty of natural light inside, amplifying the sensation of space, while the increased ceiling height adds more usable vertical space. On the left side of the house, you'll discover the snug lounge and lofted bedroom. The area on the ground floor is fitted with two comfy armchairs, a center table, and a rustic woven bench for more seating space, creating a nice setup for welcoming guests. However, this is a versatile open-floor area that you can configure the way you want. There is enough space for a convertible couch for extra sleeping space, a desk under the large window for a luminous working space, or even a couch and a dining table set. The galley kitchen comes with an impressive amount of storage space, considering the size of the house. There is an almost full-height pantry and various under-counter cabinets for all your cooking essentials. You probably don't expect this, but this kitchen is also equipped with residential-size appliances, including a large stainless steel sink, a three-burner induction cooktop, and an apartment-size fridge/freezer. There is even a dedicated space for a washer/dryer combo unit under the countertop. The bathroom inside the Overlook has been designed with the same attention to detail and includes a high-quality tiled shower, a flush toilet, and a small wall-mounted vanity. Apart from meeting all your sanitary needs, it also offers some built-in storage behind the shower to help you keep the space clean and organized. Small but mighty, the [home on wheels](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/this-custom-tiny-home-provides-a-hughly-functional-and-intentional-living-space-237072.html)that is as practical as it is adorable. At just 20 feet long and 8 feet wide, it perfectly exemplifies the tiny life philosophy and the freedom that comes with living with less. In a society where everything gets bigger, faster, and more expensive, and over-consumption often dominates our lifestyles, tiny houses represent a refreshing alternative, allowing people to slow down and reconsider their priorities.

This mini-home offers a delicate balance between beautiful aesthetics and functional efficiency while retaining most of the features that have made tiny houses a viable alternative to traditional housing. The fact that it is small doesn't mean it's plain or boring, though. Built on a double-axle trailer, the Overlook boasts a [charming exterior](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/the-albatros-tiny-aims-to-show-that-less-is-more-small-house-big-family-236866.html)that combines board-and-batten LP sheets with pine German siding for a modern look. It is coupled with a heavy-duty metal roof that ensures durability and longevity. Different roof lines add architectural interest and create more headroom in the kitchen and living area. Some notable features on the outside include a cantilevered bump-out at the rear, which expands the lofted area, and a huge 2-foot tall by 6-foot wide window right beneath it that offers those inside beautiful views.

Using the principles of Scandinavian design and showing a deep understanding of space dynamics, the builders managed to create a living space that feels inviting, comfortable, and practical. Obviously, since the interior space is limited, we cannot speak of separate rooms inside this home but rather different functional areas in a seamlessly connected open floor plan. The simple layout includes a lounge area, a kitchen, a sleeping loft, and a compact bathroom. With each living space connected to the next, dwellers can enjoy an uninterrupted flow from one end of the house to the other. The [compact footprint](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/the-terra-m2tiny-house-on-wheels-packs-a-3-level-interior-into-a-very-compact-footprint-236752.html)also means the design is dominated by beautiful simplicity and minimalism, and everything is within easy reach. In addition, the designers used some well-known tricks to make the space feel more open and commodious. The white walls and large windows in the main living area invite plenty of natural light inside, amplifying the sensation of space, while the increased ceiling height adds more usable vertical space.

There is enough space for a convertible couch for extra sleeping space, a desk under the large window for a luminous working space, or even a couch and a dining table set. The sleeping space above is nothing fancy. Accessed via a typical wood ladder, it is actually the most basic sleeping loft you'll ever see, with just a double mattress for comfortable and restful nights. The galley kitchen comes with an impressive amount of storage space, considering the size of the house. There is an almost full-height pantry and various under-counter cabinets for all your cooking essentials. You probably don't expect this, but this kitchen is also equipped with residential-size appliances, including a large stainless steel sink, a three-burner induction cooktop, and an apartment-size fridge/freezer.

Inside this home, you'll find black vinyl windows, luxury vinyl plank waterproof flooring, cabinet-grade plywood ceiling in the living room, and pine shiplap ceilings in the kitchen and bathroom area. In the kitchen, the builders used quartz countertops and 100% wood cabinets with soft close. Small but mighty, the",

    "text": "I've said it several times and I'll say it again: DEI is poison. I know Donald Trump is going to be the nominee, but I was really pulling for Ron DeSantis, because he got stuff done, like pulling funding for DEI departments from Florida state schools. He sent the whole DEI department at New College of Florida packing. Trump had called for defunding DEI efforts in government organizations, but it was late in his term and we never got to see if he was going to follow through. As we learned from that congressional hearing with the three university presidents, Jews don't seem to fall under DEI protections. Calls for the genocide of the Jewish people had to be taken \"in context.\" Jewish Insider reports that a pro-Hamas professor from the University of Minnesota is up for the position of lead of the school's DEI department. Haley Cohen reports: A University of Minnesota professor who denied Hamas terrorists committed rape and sexual violence against Israeli women on Oct. 7 is being considered for a top administrative position in the college’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) department. Sima Shakhsari is an associate professor in the department of Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies, and has been seen on campus attending pro-Palestinian rallies chanting “Globalize the Intifada.” Shakhsari, who uses they/he/she pronouns, also has a long history of aligning with radical groups like Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). Shakhsari’s denial that Israeli women were raped by Hamas came during the professor’s testimony last Thursday to the university review panel, part of the application process in being considered for the associate dean of the DEI office in the College of Liberal Arts position. The department of Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies, of course. Recommended How is this real?— Aviva Klompas (@AvivaKlompas) A [@UMNews]professor who denied terrorists committed rape and sexual violence against Israeli women on Oct. 7 is being considered for a top administrative position in the college’s DEI department. The same professor has been seen on campus attending rallies… [December 22, 2023] \"The same professor has been seen on campus attending rallies chanting 'Globalize the Intifada.'\" Please. Those activities are what helped guarantee her the position.— Faye Hausendorff (@FayeH321) [December 22, 2023] Most likely. First, the school should do away with the Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies department. Then it should get rid of its DEI department. Diversity, equity, and inclusion — whose job it is to deny admission to whites and Asian Americans. Of course it's the DEI dept. These people aren't qualified for anything else. It's a jobs program for racist leftists who want a job where they get paid to be racist.— Missus Bennet 🚚 🚛 (@poornerves) [December 23, 2023] It’s Minnesota, home of Omar, that’s why not only is it real, but foreseeable.— Always Looking for the Truth (@lehmanlaw) [December 22, 2023] True … it's the same state that just changed its flag to look more like Somalia's. DEI means hating white people and Western culture. Until recently, many (most?) Jews thought that did not include them, so they supported DEI. Now this.— LoveHerMadly (@Xlovehermadly) [December 22, 2023] What I don't understand is why people who acknowledge (and celebrate) that Hamas invaded Israel on October 7, killed over a thousand citizens, and took more than 200 hostages, are offended by the suggestion that Hamas terrorists raped anyone. They may have shot them or burned them alive, but rape? No way. It's like the people so triggered by those posters of the hostages that they tear them down … we thought they were happy that Hamas took hostages.
