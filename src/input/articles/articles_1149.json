[PTI](/pti-stories)| Bhopal | Updated: 20-01-2024 22:57 IST | Created: 20-01-2024 22:57 IST - Country: - India Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav on Saturday said that even Imran Khan, the former prime minister of \"enemy country\" Pakistan, wants a leader like Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their country. Yadav was addressing a function at a Ram temple in Anand Nagar locality of Bhopal. The chief minister said India is witnessing such a time that the world keeps an eye on the results when Modi walks, acts and takes a decision. \"Not only us, the neighbouring countries also say (this). The former prime minister of an enemy country like Pakistan, Imran Khan, says that he wishes Modi was their leader. (He tells their people that) We should learn from Modi ji,\" Yadav said. Even \"17 lakh years after Ram\", there is a feeling that there should be Ram Rajya, the CM said. \"Everybody wants a son like Ram, an example of 'maryada' (dignity) like the Himalayas, the highest standard,\" he said. The Madhya Pradesh government has already announced a half-day for government offices and a holiday for schools and colleges in the state on the occasion of the consecration of the idol of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya on January 22. The state government has also declared a holiday for Anganwadi centres on the consecration day, besides ordering the closure of meat shops and slaughterhouses.

    "text": "The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) has today escalated its response to severe storms impacting Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria since 23 December, declaring an Insurance Catastrophe. This decision reflects the escalating severity of the situation, the high volume of claims already received, and the anticipated impact of further extreme weather events forecast for the coming days. The ICA's Catastrophe declaration serves to escalate and prioritise the insurance industry's response for affected policyholders. Under the Catastrophe declaration: - Claims from affected policyholders will be given priority by insurers. - Claims will be triaged to direct urgent assistance to the worst-affected property owners. - ICA representatives will be mobilised to work with local agencies and services and affected policyholders as soon as emergency services say it is safe to do so. - Insurers will mobilise disaster response specialists to assist affected customers with claims and assessments as soon as emergency services say it is safe to do so. - An industry taskforce has been established to identify and address issues arising from this catastrophe. - The insurance industry has made this Catastrophe Declaration to activate services and support for affected homeowners and businesses and reassure them that their insurer is there to help. As of today, insurers had received 18,174 claims related to the storms across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, with 10,716 claims in the Gold Coast region alone. Access to storm-damaged areas remains hampered by ongoing power outages. The Insurance Council urge homeowners and business owners whose property or vehicle has been impacted to contact their insurer as soon as possible to initiate the claims process, even if the full extent of the damage is unclear. For those beginning cleanup efforts, they are not obligated to retain damaged property, including carpets and furnishings. Simply take photos, record any identifying information, and keep material samples for claims purposes. Quote attributable to ICA COO Kylie Macfarlane: Given the immense scale and destructive nature of these storms across eastern Australia, the Insurance Council and insurers are escalating our response to a Catastrophe level to better serve the immediate and future needs of our customers. Insurers expect claims volumes to grow in the coming days as more residents gain access to properties and power is restored to some areas, however, it is too early to understand the cost of the damage. We encourage residents to put their safety and the safety of their family first and contact their insurer if they need immediate financial assistance.

    "text": "Deteriorating ice creates dangerous conditions on Minnesota lakes Deteriorating ice on lakes across Minnesota is causing dangerous conditions. Law enforcement officials and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources are urging ice-anglers to be extremely cautious. Ice conditions are poor and deteriorating across the state because of warm temperatures and recent rainfall. “In some areas we have no ice and it’s kind of like the beginning of the ice season and some places we have ice that looks more like the end of the ice season where it’s rotten and melting,” said DNR Ice Safety Coordinator Nicole Biagi. “But in either case, the ice is not safe right now.” Grow the Future of Public Media MPR News is supported by Members. Gifts from individuals power everything you find here. Make a gift of any amount today to become a Member! Beltrami County law enforcement has been involved in several recent ice rescues on Upper Red Lake, and Sheriff Jason Riggs wants people to reconsider driving or bringing ice fishing campers called wheelhouses onto ice. “Most years, the ice would be thick enough by now for vehicles and wheelhouses, and we’d be seeing a steady procession of them heading north,” he said. “But this year isn’t ‘most years.’” Two anglers went through the ice on Red Lake Thursday, but managed to get themselves out before first responders arrived. Beltrami County emergency management director Christopher Muller stresses how unusual an ice season it’s been so far. “We’ve had an above normal number of people that have been falling through the ice,” he said. “I don’t ever remember getting two inches of rain over Christmas, which also deteriorated the ice conditions.” On many lakes there is open water. There are reports of people water skiing over the Christmas holiday and anglers choosing to fish from a boat instead of through the ice. On lakes across the state, DNR conservation officers have responded to all-terrain vehicles and ice fishing shelters falling through the weakened ice, said Biagi. And conditions change rapidly. “If it was safe yesterday, that doesn’t mean that it's safe today,” she said.“And even when you’re out there, if you had enough ice to walk out there in the morning, it might not be enough ice for your walk back at the end of the day.” Anyone venturing out on the ice should wear a personal flotation device to prevent drowning if the ice gives way. Biagi said many people worry about hypothermia if they fall through the ice, but you are more likely to drown before hypothermia can set in. Contact with the cold water causes involuntary gasping and hyperventilating that can lead to inhaling enough water to drown. “When we do have fatalities through the ice, it’s almost always drowning,” she said. Biagi urges parents to remind children to stay off frozen lakes or ponds unless an adult determines the ice is safe.",
