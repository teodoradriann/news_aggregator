    "text": "Pro-life leader anticipates major victories despite recent ballot initiatives expanding abortion access For a prominent pro-life group, recent setbacks at the ballot box have not tampered spirits for the future of the movement to create a culture that protects unborn life in the womb. The March for Life — the organization and the annual event that attracts tens of thousands of people (at least) from across the country each January — has grown significantly in the 50 years since the first march in 1974. Activists assembled on the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which effectively made [abortion legal](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court) in every state across the country. Since then, the march always had Roe as its chief point of protest, but in the year and a half since the [Supreme Court overturned](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court) Roe's precedent in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, the energy surrounding the march has not waned. \"The march for life was born in a moment after Roe was overturned, and there was a lot of confusion about choosing life, and the unborn child,\" March for Life President Jeanne Mancini told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"We think this particular moment calls for these marches, and that the pro-life grassroots needs strengthening and even a little direction right now. That's where we see the state march program as being so critically important.\" [FORMER TRUMP ADVISER KELLYANNE CONWAY LEADS CHARGE TO OVERHAUL GOP ABORTION STRATEGY, END DEMS' 2024 ADVANTAGE](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-leads-charge-overhaul-gop-abortion-strategy-end-democrat-2024-advantage) In the past five years, the March for Life has expanded to the state level, hosting annual rallies in cities across the country organized by state chapters of the national organization. The state-level expansion is moving fast. In 2018, March for Life Virginia held an inaugural march. In 2023, eight states held marches, and next year March for Life will be in 17 states, and Mancini has plans to be in every state in the union in the next six years or so. Following the Dobbs decision in June 2022, pro-life leaders and conservative politicians have sought to redirect activism to state-level political battles and focus on creating a \"culture of life.\" March for Life's goal, Mancini said, is to create a world where \"abortion is unthinkable.\" That effort is as much about helping women with unexpected pregnancies as it is about changing laws around abortion. \"There's so much confusion about what it means to be a woman, and frankly, what it means to be pro-life. The heart of pro-life is supporting women and wanting what's best for them,\" Mancini said. The political fight over abortion does not appear to be going away, and pro-life leaders are far from giving up on pushing for state or national pro-life legislation. However, pro-life causes have had a series of setbacks in statewide ballot initiatives in the past two elections. Most recently, Ohio voted to enshrine a right to access abortion into its state constitution in November. \"With the ballot initiatives, we're learning a lot,\" Mancini said. \"As we're moving and changing culture, we're going to have lessons along the way.\" [PRO-LIFE GROUP ADDRESSES WHAT WENT WRONG IN OHIO ABORTION VOTE, HOW TO RESPOND IN 2024](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-life-group-what-went-wrong-ohio-abortion-vote-how-to-respond-2024) As many pro-life leaders have pointed out, Mancini noted that public opinion surveys show most Americans are not in favor of completely unrestricted abortion. \"For at least 12 years strong, 7 out of 10 Americans would limit abortion at most to the first three months of pregnancy. And that's not our national law,\" Mancini said. \"Some states do enact protective laws of life prior to that moment, which is wonderful, but our national law is not in line with most of Europe.\" The theme of the 2024 March for Life is \"with every woman, for every child.\" It aims to address the confusion and show that being pro-life is not only about political fights without regard to the difficulties of an unplanned pregnancy. \"We see two patients when someone is facing an unexpected pregnancy, and we want both of those patients to fully flourish.\" The Charlotte Lozier Institute released a report earlier in December about the impact nearly 3,000 pro-life [pregnancy centers](https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-life-groups-hammer-twisted-attempt-democratic-ags-hinder-pregnancy-centers-from-helping-women) across the nation have had serving women. The [report showed](https://lozierinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pregnancy-Center-Update_2022.pdf) that in 2022 alone, the network of mostly locally-run pregnancy centers provided nearly 800,000 new client consultations, 700,000 pregnancy tests, half a million ultrasounds, and hundreds of thousands of STI tests, parenting classes and sexual risk avoidance education. Pregnancy centers also provided \"after-abortion support\" to 20,000 clients. The centers also delivered $358 million worth of material support for new mothers, including cribs, strollers, diapers, baby formula and car seats, the report said. Mancini said there was a distinction between advocacy for abortion access, and the pro-life movement. Abortion access tends to prey on women's fears, implying that those carrying an unplanned pregnancy are not capable of bearing or raising children, Mancini said. \"The pro-life movement is the opposite,\" Mancini said. \"We want to encourage and support women, come alongside them and strengthen them; and tell them 'you can do this. You have what it takes to do this. This is going to be hard, but it will be beautiful, and we will be here with you.'\" Original article source: [Pro-life leader anticipates major victories despite recent ballot initiatives expanding abortion access](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-life-leader-anticipates-major-victories-despite-recent-ballot-initiatives-expanding-abortion-access)",

Charleston experienced about 11 such floods in 2024.\nFile/Andrew Whitaker/Staff Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Charleston Harbor hit a flood stage 54 times in 2024. By the numbers, it was the calmest year for flooding in the Holy City since 2021. But it was one of the most active years since record-keeping began 100 years ago.\nSpecifically, 2024 took home seventh place on the National Weather Service's Coastal Flood Events Database .\nAs ocean levels near Charleston have risen about a foot over the past century, the number of tidal floods (also called \"sunny day floods\") has increased.

It's also the most expensive reporting we do. We can't do it without your support.\nDonate Now Water levels are likely to rise another foot-plus over the next 25 years, and city leaders point to the steady uptick in flooding as one of Charleston's greatest existential threats. As ocean levels rise, the frequency and severity of those tidal floods will increase. By 2050, Charleston could experience as many as 170 flood events per year, or about one every other day, according to Charleston's recently released Water Plan.\nThe harbor is considered in \"flood stage\" whenever it hits 7 feet or higher. Those stages are broken into three categories.\n\"Minor\" begins at 7 feet, and it's the most frequent. These are typically nuisance floods that create large puddles, make the commute to and from work a bit tricky and may result in some light hydroplaning. \"Moderate\" begins at 7.5 feet, and at that point roads start closing down, lower-lying areas are inundated and residents can count on migraine-inducing traffic jams. \"Major\" floods occur at 8 feet or higher. Those are the washouts that swamp downtown, and essentially shut down the peninsula.\n\"Over 71 percent of all major tidal floods have occurred in the last nine years,\" Jared Bramblett, a senior water resources engineer at Moffatt & Nichol and one of the Water Plan's creators, said at a City Council meeting on the Water Plan in August.\nBuy Now A truck moves through floodwaters in the intersection of Fishburne Street and Hagood Avenue during a king tide Sept. 20, 2024, in Charleston. The area is one of the lowest-lying in the city, and floods regularly.\nFile/Andrew Whitaker/Staff Charleston experienced three of those major floods last year. According to Charleston's Water Plan, the city could see nearly 30 such washouts annually by 2050 — or one roughly every two weeks.",

    "title": "Tarifeinigung für Dönerfabrik Birtat",
    "text": "Arbeitskampf\nTarifeinigung für Dönerfabrik Birtat\nMurr (dpa)\nDie schwäbische Dönerfabrik Birtat ist einer der führenden Hersteller von Dönerspießen. Die Mitarbeiter kämpfen für einen Tarifvertrag und bessere Bezahlung. Nun freuen sie sich über die Einigung.\nDie Beschäftigten beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat zerkleinern Fleisch, marinieren und stecken es dann auf die Spieße - ein Knochenjob. Für sie gilt künftig nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. In ihm wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Für Betriebsratschef Muzayfe Doganer ist mit dem Haustarifvertrag «ein Traum» wahr geworden. «Ich wollte weinen.» Er sei stolz auf die rund 120 Mitarbeiter. Es sei ein Ergebnis, das für beide Seiten gut sei.\nFerner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden, wie beide Seiten mitteilten.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG hatte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um monatlich 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag gefordert. Die Beschäftigten legten ihre Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise nieder.\nNGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten.\nUnternehmenssprecher Cihan Karaman sagte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: «Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.» Der Vertrag ist ein Haustarifvertrag, weil er zwischen der Gewerkschaft und dem Unternehmen abgeschlossen worden ist.\nVerband: 400 Dönerhersteller in Deutschland\nDie Tarifauseinandersetzung wurde in den vergangenen Wochen mit harten Bandagen geführt. Beide Seiten mussten Zugeständnisse machen. In der zweiten Urabstimmung votierten rund 90 Prozent der befragten NGG-Mitglieder für die Annahme des Tarifvertrags.\nDie Tarifparteien verpflichten sich zudem, nun über einen Tarifvertrag zur Eingruppierung sowie einen Manteltarifvertrag zu verhandeln. Die Gewerkschaft hofft, dass sie künftig gleichfalls bei anderen Unternehmen der Branche tarifvertragliche Regelungen durchsetzen kann. DGB-Landeschef Kai Burmeister sagte, der Tarifabschluss bei Birtat sei ein toller und hart erkämpfter Erfolg für die Beschäftigten und die NGG. Birtat gehört zur Meat World SE, nach NGG-Angaben der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert.\nBirtat versorgt nach eigenen Angaben Tausende Imbisse und erreicht mehr als 13 Millionen Konsumentinnen und Konsumenten monatlich. «Unsere Produkte kann man fast in jeder großen Stadt in Europa verkosten», sagte ein Firmensprecher kürzlich. Man sei Marktführer. Meat World machte demnach zuletzt einen Jahresumsatz von ungefähr 200 Millionen Euro. Nach Angaben des Verbands der Dönerproduzenten gibt es etwa 400 Dönerhersteller hierzulande.",
