    "title": "France | A mother and son who were skiing died in an avalanche - Pledge Times",
    "text": "The family was skiing near the Swiss border. British A 54-year-old woman and her 22-year-old son were killed in an avalanche in France near the Saint-Gervais ski resort on Thursday. The mother and son were skiing near the Swiss border when they were buried by an avalanche around 3:30 p.m. local time on Thursday. The British Broadcasting Corporation reports on the matter [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67840309). The mother and son were part of a group of five skiers, which included members of the same family and a guide the family had known for years. Avalanche started near the resort of Saint-Gervais at an altitude of about 2,300 meters. According to local authorities, the avalanche moved about 400 meters. A group of skiers higher up on the slope is suspected to be the trigger. The victims were found after about five hours of searching. Two helicopters and 20 people belonging to the first aid team were involved in the search. The victims were found lifeless and buried in the snow. The guide accompanying the family reportedly had an avalanche warning device, which is used to locate people caught in an avalanche. However, none of the family members had one. In France, about 110 people fall into avalanches every year and about 30 people die in avalanches every year. Correction 29.12. 8:11 p.m.: The family's guide had with him a device used to locate people in an avalanche, apparently not an avalanche warning device as the story said earlier. #France #mother #son #skiing #died #avalanche",

    "title": "Quel avenir pour le CF Montréal?",
    "text": "La modification importante que veut apporter la MLS à son calendrier n’annonce rien de bon pour l’avenir du soccer professionnel à Montréal. Don Garber et ses penseurs veulent calquer leur championnat sur ceux des Européens. La saison s’amorcerait en août et s’étendrait jusqu’à la Coupe MLS à la fin mai. Une pause de cinq semaines serait décrétée en décembre, avec reprise début février. Une catastrophe pour le CF Montréal, le seul club évoluant en territoire nordique à ne pas posséder un terrain chauffé. Joey Saputo avait préféré une surface régulière non chauffée et avec elle une économie de quelques millions lors de la construction de son Stade. Modifier le tout couterait au bas mot 10 millions en dollars d’aujourd’hui, un investissement colossal pour un propriétaire qui dépense à peine plus pour l’ensemble du salaire de ses joueurs actuellement. Il faut aussi savoir que la famille Saputo opère le Stade du même nom sans toutefois posséder le terrain sur lequel il est construit. Autrement dit ils ne peuvent pas dire «nous sommes maîtres chez nous» pour paraphraser feu Jean Lesage... Revenons à l’essentiel. Comment le CF Montréal pourra survivre avec un calendrier qui sera face à face avec le Canadien 90% du temps comparativement à 25% actuellement? Qui plus est en étant privé des salles combles potentielles de mai juin et juillet? Il faudrait que la MLS mette en oeuvre une pause plus longue, du genre de celles que l’on permet en Russie alors que le championnat s’arrête pendant les froids mois d’hiver. Ça aurait pour effet de compromettre la «Leagues Cup». Vous ne trouvez pas que ça commence à faire beaucoup de courbettes pour le seul petit marché de Montréal? Si au moins le Stade Saputo comportait une surface chauffée et encore. Est-ce que la famille voudra se compromettre dans un tel investissement? Est-ce qu’elle ne va pas préférer vendre en exploitant sur son modeste coût d’entrée en MLS? C’est ici que la ville de Détroit entre en scène. La relance de Détroit n’est plus de la fiction, c’est une réalité qui se décline à coups de milliards. Deux grands groupes se disputent les franchises professionnelles de la capitale de l'automobile nord-américaine. Bien entendu la famille Illitch, menée par le descendant Christopher, propriétaire des Red Wings et des Tigers. Et le milliardaire Dan Gilbert, à la tête de Rocket Mortgage et qui a l’œil sur les Lions, encore propriété de la descendance de la famille Ford, du Ford Field et éventuellement sur une franchise de la MLS. C’est un secret de polichinelle que la MLS ne veut absolument pas permettre de vente et de transfert de franchises tant qu’elle n’aura pas complété son cycle d’octroi de concessions d’expansion. Une grâce potentielle d’encore cinq ans. Toutefois, Montréal représente la seule exception possible et alléchante pour Don Garber. Qui est désormais le principal partenaire médiatique pour la diffusion des matchs de la MLS? Apple TV. Est-ce que l’aventure est un franc succès jusqu’ici? Absolument pas. Particulièrement au Canada, encore moins au Québec. La preuve? Le match éliminatoire du CF cette semaine a de nouveau été rendu disponible sans frais sur la plateforme Apple. Maintenant, posez-vous la question. Combien de centaines de milliers de dollars sauverait Apple en n’ayant plus aucune obligation de produire du contenu et des matchs en langue française? Trouvez la réponse à cette question et comprenez que la crainte de voir le CF Montréal être vendu et transférer à Détroit en vue de la saison 25-26 n’est peut-être pas totalement farfelu.",

    "text": "Forbes “30 Under 30'” honors eight Stanford affiliates working in sustainability\nIn categories ranging from Energy & Greentech to Social Impact, the 2025 Forbes feature recognizes five Stanford alumni, a postdoc, and two students for their work in sustainability.\nThe annual “30 Under 30” for North America [feature](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2025/) from Forbes this year honors five very recent Stanford alumni, a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and an undergraduate on leave for their early-career contributions to clean energy and other sustainability solutions. Six of the eight were recognized for their cleantech startups. The 2025 group brings the number of Stanford scholars and alumni in sustainability recognized by the magazine over four years to 40.\nThe Stanford affiliates were highlighted in four categories this year. A postdoc, a student on leave, and one alumnus were recognized in the Energy & Greentech category (links to LinkedIn profiles): postdoc [Fabia Farlin Athena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabia-farlin-athena/), student on leave [Tristan Semmelhack](https://linkedin.com/in/tristan-semmelhack-6a1ba0149/), ’26, and alumnus [Zhiao Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiao-yu/), PhD ’22. Two alumni and one student in sustainability made the Manufacturing & Industry category: [Halen Mattison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hgm/), MS ’22, [Luke Neise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-neise/), MS ’22, and [Krish Mehta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishmehta/), MS/MBA expected ’24. [Sasankh Munukutla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasankh/), BS ’22/MS ’23, in Social Impact and [Savannah Eisner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/savannaheisner/), PhD ’22, in Science round out the Stanford affiliates working in sustainability garnering 2025 Forbes acclaim.\nStanford’s growing cleantech ecosystem partly explains the growing number and breadth of sustainability entrepreneurs recognized by Forbes. Three of the eight are alumni of the [Precourt Institute for Energy](http://energy.stanford.edu/)’s course “[Stanford Climate Ventures](https://stanfordclimateventures.org/),” which teaches students how to begin to commercialize their technologies. In addition, three won [Innovation Transfer Program](https://tomkat.stanford.edu/innovation-transfer) grants from [TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy](https://tomkat.stanford.edu/) to begin their startups based on technology developed at Stanford. One of the 10 is in her first year of the Precourt Institute’s [Stanford Energy Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://energypostdoc.stanford.edu/). Both the Precourt Institute and the TomKat Center are part the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability.\n30 Under 30 in Energy\nIn the Energy category, [Fabia Farlin Athena](https://www.forbes.com/profile/fabia-farlin-athena/) (links to Forbes profiles) is working on emerging materials and devices for computing hardware to make artificial intelligence more energy efficient. Emerging non-volatile memories and novel materials like adaptive oxides, oxide semiconductors, and low-dimensional materials have immense potential for low-power AI applications. Born and raised in Bangladesh, Athena earned her doctorate in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech. As a Stanford Energy Fellow under the mentorship of faculty members [H.-S. Philip Wong](https://profiles.stanford.edu/philip-wong) and [Alberto Salleo](https://profiles.stanford.edu/alberto-salleo), she is developing high-bandwidth gain cell memory solutions for energy-efficient AI applications.\nForbes also recognized [Reflect Orbital](https://www.forbes.com/profile/reflect-orbital/), founded by Stanford student on leave Tristan Semmelhack, originally a member of the undergraduate class of 2026, and Ben Nowack, a graduate of Wentworth Institute of Technology. Their audacious startup aims to deliver solar power at night via mirrors in space. The two tested their \"sunlight as a service\" concept last year by attaching an 8'x8' mirror to a hot air balloon, reflecting sunlight at dusk over the horizon to an area where the sun had already set. The light powered solar panels located in the dark. The team intends to launch many mirrors into low-earth orbit to deliver light for solar power and light’s many other uses. The [video of their test](https://x.com/bennbuilds/status/1767961251186163857) has 2.2 million views on X. Reflect Orbital, which has 10 employees including the founders, raised $6.5 million in a seed round led by Sequoia Capital this past September, according to the [company website](https://www.reflectorbital.com/).\n\"At the highest level, we’re selling sunlight. We’ve developed a system where we can project a 5-kilometer-wide spot of light anywhere in the world after sunset.\" –Tristan Semmelhack, via [Stanford Review](https://stanfordreview.org/reflect-orbital/)\n[Zhiao Yu](https://www.forbes.com/profile/zhiao-yu/) is the co-founder and chief technology officer of [Feon Energy](https://www.feonenergy.com/), which is developing new electrolytes to enable lithium metal batteries. If engineers like Yu can resolve lithium metal batteries’ major flaw – a short lifespan – electric vehicles would become less expensive and go much farther on a single charge. Born and raised in China, Yu earned his Stanford PhD in the laboratory of chemical engineering professor [Zhenan Bao](https://profiles.stanford.edu/zhenan-bao). The other co-founder of Feon is Wenxiao Huang, who was a postdoc at Stanford and is over 30 years old. Yu is an alumnus of the Stanford Climate Ventures course, and he received a TomKat Innovation Transfer grant. Since its founding, Feon has raised more than $8 million in investments.\n30 Under 30 in Manufacturing & Industry\nForbes also honored [General Galactic](https://www.gengalactic.com/), founded by Halen Mattison and Luke Neise. Their proprietary reactor converts captured carbon dioxide into affordable, renewable natural gas and other carbon-neutral fuels. Mattison and Neise’s pilot plant now produces 2,000 liters of renewable fuel daily, the magazine reports. The Stanford spinout has raised $10 million, including an $8-million seed round last month. Mattison, the company's CEO, and Neise, its CTO, earned Stanford master’s degrees in, respectively, mechanical engineering and aeronautics. Both took the Stanford Climate Ventures course. Neise also trained for six months in the [Stanford Technology Ventures Program](https://stvp.stanford.edu/). Prior to General Galactic’s founding, Mattison was an engineer for almost two years at SpaceX.\n[Krish Mehta] is completing master’s degrees in business and in climate technology in the [Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment & Resources](https://eiper.stanford.edu/). At Stanford, Mehta co-founded [PHNX Materials](https://www.phnxmaterials.com/) with former Stanford postdoc Jorge Osio-Norgaard, who is over 30. The early-stage startup focuses on recovering valuable titanium, aluminum and rare earth materials from coal ash landfills. The remaining coal ash is refined into a high-performance supplementary cement-like material, capable of replacing up to 30% of the cement in concrete, slashing carbon emissions. PHNX has raised $3 million from investors. Mehta and Osio-Norgaard benefitted from the Stanford Climate Ventures course, the Hacking for Climate course, and a TomKat Innovation Transfer grant. Mehta is a [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/) at Stanford.\n30 Under 30 in Social Impact\nIn the Social Impact category, Forbes recognized [Sasankh Munukutla](https://www.forbes.com/profile/sasankh-munukutla/), who cofounded the startup [Terradot](https://terradot.earth/) with Stanford alumnus James Kanoff, BS ’22. (Kanoff was named a 30 Under 30 honoree three years ago for a separate endeavor in sustainability, the non-profit [Farmlink Project](https://www.farmlinkproject.org/).) Munukutla served as a commander in the Singapore Armed Forces for two years before coming to Stanford, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. Using a process called enhanced rock weathering, Terradot applies crushed silicate rock powder to agricultural fields, which then extracts carbon from the atmosphere for 10,000-plus years. This also improves soil health to boost farmers' yields. Munukutla has focused on measuring, reporting, and verifying the quantity of CO2 sequestered, which [he has called](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/news-history/sasankh-munukutla-bs-22-ms-23-harnessing-earths-natural-co2-removal-process) the key to enhanced rock weathering acquiring the money needed to make it a billion-ton climate solution. He and Kanoff have raised $5.2 million in venture funding from investors that include John Doerr, Kleiner Perkins, and Sheryl Sandberg. Terradot got started with an Innovation Transfer grant in 2022.\n“You have to track the carbon through the soil, into the groundwater, then streams, rivers, and ultimately the ocean, where it is stored for hundreds of thousands of years. Nothing about that is easy.” –Sasankh Munukutla\n30 Under 30 in Science\n[Savannah Eisner](https://www.forbes.com/profile/savannah-eisner/) is an assistant professor at Columbia University who earned her PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford and continued her research for five months as a Stanford postdoc. Eisner is developing electronics and sensor systems that can survive in space and other harsh environments. She has used the micro and nano-sized devices she has invented for environmental monitoring, as well as hypersonic aircraft and helping NASA explore the surface of Venus.\nThe Precourt Institute for Energy was founded in 2009 with a gift from Jay Precourt, BS ’59, MS ’60, and his family. The Stanford Climate Ventures course is funded by Tom and Johanna Baruch and offered through the Department of Energy Science & Engineering. The TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy was founded in 2009 with a gift from Tom Steyer, MBA ’83, and Kat Taylor, JD/MBA ’86.\nExplore More\n-\nThe unprecedented stream of ultra-bright X-rays could help in the development of a new generation of clean biofuels and sustainable manufacturing methods.\n-\nAI components in the traditional guidance, navigation, and control pipeline make these rendezvous smoother, faster, more fuel efficient, and safer.",

    "title": "Thyssen's steel division must face reality",
    "text": "Whether it’s Bosch, Schaeffler, Volkswagen, or now Thyssenkrupp Steel – management boards everywhere are resorting to drastic measures, planning massive job cuts. The fact that Germany’s industrial base is faltering is hardly news. However, when thousands of industrial job losses are announced daily, alarm bells must ring.Of course, each case is different, but at least in the cases of Volkswagen and Thyssenkrupp, one thing stands out: boards and supervisory councils have denied reality for years. Now, it’s the employees who are left to bear the brunt of these missteps. That is a bitter pill to swallow. That said, this doesn’t mean that employee representatives, including the powerful IG Metall union, bear no responsibility for the crisis. On the contrary, their focus on preserving existing privileges has also prevented timely corrective action.Thyssenkrupp’s steel division is a prime example. Every attempt to transition the business to a future-proof structure has been undermined. From the 2018 (!) proposed merger with Tata Steel – ostensibly blocked by EU Commission requirements – to talks with Salzgitter about an equal partnership.One of the key problems has been evident for years: the global steel market suffers from overcapacity. Without significant reductions in production capacity, some manufacturers will not have a future. It’s clear who will be the first to exit the market: producers with uncompetitive cost structures.The analysis for Thyssenkrupp’s steel division is sobering. Over the past five years, the operating profit margin has averaged a mere 0.4%. At the same time, 900 net full-time jobs were added, even though capacity utilisation has been low for years. This occurred despite an agreement in 2019 to shed 3,000 jobs.That was before the Covid-19 pandemic and the energy price shock following Russia’s war on Ukraine exacerbated the situation. This added fundamental changes to the already numerous self-inflicted problems. Above all, energy-intensive industries have since been groaning under high electricity prices, which are uncompetitive not only globally, but also within Europe.But the responsible parties in Thyssenkrupp Steel have turned a blind eye to reality. The fact that money was being burned year after year seemingly didn’t matter, as the sale of the elevator division had injected 17 billion euros into the company’s coffers. However, the laissez-faire approach of recent years is now taking its toll. The job and capacity cuts are therefore all the more severe. Over the next five years, the workforce is to be reduced by 40%, and production capacity by over 20%.The new board plans to continue building the first and likely only direct reduction plant for producing „green“ steel. But conditions in Germany for green electricity and green hydrogen remain uncompetitive.Without question, the steel board’s roadmap for the future includes many harsh measures that the workforce and unions are rightly reluctant to accept. However, the reality is that structural change cannot be ignored or „protested away“. Adaptation is essential – those who fail to adjust will disappear from the market.",

This is how Suella Braverman described pro-Palestine protesters in a piece for the Times last week. Far-right protesters, including Tommy Robinson, turned up in London on Saturday, the day of the pro-Palestine march, to assert their own primacy, and clashed with police. This was not inevitable, but always highly possible. A swirl of Islamophobia and anti-immigration rhetoric have been part of our politics for so long that all it took was one motivated actor to convert them into something explosive.\n....\nIt has been easy to forget just how pervasive anti-Muslim messaging was, because we have in recent years also become engulfed in all manner of culture wars about identity, history and gender. But for the decade and a half after 9/11, it was open season on Muslims, first as terror suspects, and then as just dodgy wrong ’uns. One may not recall the detail of all the allegations, yet the essence has lingered and settled in our collective psyche. How could it not, when we were told that Christian children were forced into the foster care of Muslim families who “didn’t speak English”; that one in five British Muslims had sympathies with jihadis; that they were trying to ban £5 notes because they were not “halal”; that there was a plot to take over British schools and Islamise them?\n-50% of full article.\nread more here:\n[\nlink to www.theguardian.com (secure)\n]\nI came.
