    "text": "Phoenix family coping with tragedy during holidays, two brothers killed just days apart\nPHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) — Their Christmas tree still sparkles with lights and decorations, but the joy of the holiday has been ripped away from a Phoenix family dealing with not one but two tragedies.\n“My kids, my daughter, my sons, they can’t believe it,” said Mary Ochoa, who lost two grandsons. “We’re all grieving.”\nA week before Christmas, 40-year-old Brandon Smith\nwas shot and killed near a car wash off 40th Street and McDowell Road in Phoenix. Three days later, his younger brother Mikey Ochoa was killed when a driver ran him over while he was crossing the street near Southern Avenue and 48th Street. “Very heartbreaking,” said Valencia Sloan. “We just can’t believe it. Our oldest brother, then next thing you know, our youngest brother, one thing after another.”\nArizona’s Family sat down with family members Wednesday. They said Christmas will never be the same. They remember Smith as a big-hearted, kind, loving man who was always happy and could always make you laugh. Twenty-six-year-old Mikey Ochoa was outgoing, silly and goofy, someone who would do anything for his friends and family. “My heart was just broken inside,” said Mary Ochoa. “I just cried and cried for 2 days.”\nWhat’s made the family’s loss even more difficult is the fact they’re having to scramble to put together two funerals. “We’re doing the best we can to come up with all the expenses and raise money,” said Sloan.\nA\nGoFundMe page has been set up to help the family with funeral expenses. “I’d say there’s a lot of sadness,” said Sloan. Everyone is grieving in their own way during the holidays.” So far, no arrests have been made in either tragedy.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?\nPlease click here to report it.\nDo you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

    "title": "Biden’s Border Closure Is a Gamble That Won’t Pay Off",
    "text": "The president is gambling on a show of strength at the border to counter the authoritarian and xenophobic messages about immigration that Trump has been resurrecting. The odds are good that nobody wins.\nAt 12 a.m. on June 5, 2024, the southwest border closed to thousands of people desperate to reach the United States. Invoking the same laws used by President Trump to trigger the notorious Muslim ban of 2017, President Biden authorized the suspension of entry into the U.S. for asylum seekers and others who attempt to cross the border unlawfully.\nThe suspension goes into effect whenever encounters of non-citizens between ports of entry along the southern border or coastal areas average 2,500 attempted entries a day for seven straight days. The suspension is lifted only after encounters drop to an average of 1,500 for seven days but resumes if the average returns to the 2,500-per-seven-day ratio.\nIt’s\ncomplicated, but the long and short of it is, if you happen to enter the U.S. unlawfully during a day when entry is suspended, and you don’t qualify for the very limited exceptions set out by the president, your odds of being permitted to apply for asylum—or even getting more than a cursory examination of your case—drop to pretty much zero. If the suspension is lifted the very next day, you would likely have more due process and the chance to have an asylum screening. However, the administration is also rumored to be preparing a new rule that would tighten the screening standard even more—meaning that even on a good day, someone fleeing persecution who crosses the U.S. border from Mexico or makes it to shore by boat from Haiti is still highly unlikely to have a decent chance at applying for asylum in the U.S. Human rights and civil rights groups, as well as legal experts, have already condemned the new policy because it violates the U.S. law that permits anyone present in the country to apply for asylum, regardless of immigration status. Critics point to the reliance on Trump-era tactics and reasoning, previously rejected by numerous federal courts, as evidence that the Biden administration is less interested in finding solutions for the worldwide rise in migration than in scoring quick political points for “closing” the border. Many others are pointing to the misery and danger that befell immigrants trapped in Mexico during the Title 42 suspension and the Remain in Mexico program, predicting worse to come with the new suspension.\nThat misery hasn’t really gone away, as the Biden administration has continued to enforce policies that keep people languishing at the border while they remain in the virtual line created by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This mobile appointment system limits the number of people without papers who can present themselves for admission each day to 1,450 appointments.\nMoreover, the administration already put in place a\nregulation that prohibits people from applying for asylum if they failed to seek permission to approach the border (using the CBP app) or have been granted parole through one of the programs designed to reduce the number of people arriving unlawfully from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and Colombia. Although these parole programs and other efforts to increase refugee screenings in the Western hemisphere are a positive development, it has turned seeking protection in the U.S. into a roll of the dice. Many people can’t wait, or can’t risk the dangers that have been created by parceling out access to the border. So they continue to take the risk.\nIf you happen to enter the U.S. during a day when entry is suspended … your odds of being permitted to apply for asylum—or even getting more than a cursory examination of your case—drop to pretty much zero.\nIn the presidential proclamation issued on June 4, the administration touts its deportation record, noting that, through its use of expedited removal, it has removed 720,000 people in the last year, marking the highest rate of removals and returns since Fiscal Year 2010.\nSo, why close the border? The administration points to the unprecedented global migration crisis, the crumbling capacity of a broken immigration system and Congress’s failure to provide more resources for immigration enforcement as key factors. The proclamation is particularly critical of congressional inaction on the bipartisan\nMurphy-Lankford-Sinema immigration bill proposed in the Senate and supported by the administration, which died in the Senate in early 2024. This legislation would have adopted similar trigger methods for closing the border and significantly limited access to asylum.\nPutting the maximum positive spin on it, the border suspension is designed to project a bold move by President Biden, who is at the end of his patience with a Congress that won’t act. By taking matters into his own hands, he is following the oft-heard mantra of the last decade: Executive action is the last resort when Congress doesn’t take its responsibilities seriously.\nI have some sympathy for that general idea. At its best, exercising executive authority can prevent needless suffering. For instance, the authorization of deferred action for young people brought to the U.S. as children who did not have legal status, known as the DACA program, has been a lifeline for thousands of young people who know no home but the U.S. They have richly repaid that compassion by serving in the military, becoming first responders and teachers and showing what happens when people are given a chance to live out their potential. Similarly, the Biden administration’s use of its parole authority has been a humanitarian gesture that has protected thousands of Afghans, Ukrainians, Venezuelans and others from war and chaos.\nBut when executive action is used to restrict people’s opportunities, as with the border suspension, it’s harder to follow the logic. Under\n[Section 212(f)](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the president has the power to suspend entry of a class of people when admission to the United States is not in the country’s best interests. Thus, to justify the border suspension, the president had to determine that something about people who didn’t have permission to enter the U.S., as a category of individuals, meant that their admission—even temporarily—would threaten the best interests of this country.\nBy taking matters into his own hands, he is following the oft-heard mantra of the last decade: Executive action is the last resort when Congress doesn’t take its responsibilities seriously. … But when executive action is used to restrict people’s opportunities, as with the border suspension, it’s harder to follow the logic.\nWhile the proclamation cites the threat of overcrowded ports of entry and detention facilities and the backlog in asylum as motivating factors, that doesn’t actually explain the defining characteristic that makes certain people a threat. Reading more closely, the “unique” and threatening characteristic, apparently, is that most of these people will at least indicate a fear of return to their home countries. This triggers a credible fear screening, a low threshold for being allowed to take your case before a judge. According to the proclamation, it’s this screening itself that is the problem, as many people who pass credible fear are ultimately found ineligible for asylum and are therefore needlessly contributing to overcrowding and backlogs.\nThe problem with this argument is manifold.\n- First, a low threshold standard inevitably means that not everyone who “passes” the first step of the process will prevail at the end.\n- Second, the low final grant rate cited in the proclamation is likely calculated without taking any mitigating factors into account, such as changes in country conditions over prolonged waits for a hearing, whether or not those people denied asylum had counsel, whether they became eligible for other forms of relief and whether the expanded use of expedited removal inherently skews the results towards more denied cases.\n- But most troublingly, pointing to the credible fear standard as the problem blames a law designed to protect people’s basic rights for doing what it was supposed to do.\nCredible fear screenings are threshold tests built into a process known as expedited removal. When Congress drastically overhauled the immigration system in 1996, expedited removal was one of several accelerated processes Congress created to divert some cases—those that appeared most likely to have no basis for legal presence in the United States—from the immigration court system in the hopes of speeding up processing times and thwarting perceived asylum fraud. The credible fear process was the trade-off—a way to ensure that everyone subject to expedited removal at least got the chance to indicate a fear of return.\nOver the years, successive Republican and Democratic presidents expanded its use to the point that expedited removal is the principal tool of border removal today. Thus, when the noise is stripped away, the presidential proclamation argues that it is not in the best interests of the nation to follow its own law.\nIn other words, suspending entry is based on the opinion that those who are placed in expedited removal who express a fear of return qualify for a credible fear screening, which may result in referral to immigration court and ultimately lead to a grant of asylum, are a threat to America’s interests.\nThe slippery slope continues, bringing the country to a point where our president can argue that we have to shut the border down because asking for asylum just takes too many resources.\nIt’s a dangerous game to play. Many immigration experts and historians would argue that expedited removal itself is an affront to America’s obligation to protect refugees because the process does not give every applicant access to a full hearing. Every expansion of expedited removal has created a bigger pool of people who are deported administratively, and thus even further outside the public’s notice. This has made it easier for people to treat border crossers as less deserving of protection, which in turn led to the conditions that allowed many to accept the Title 42 pandemic closure of the border as a necessary evil. The slippery slope continues, bringing the country to a point where our president can argue that we have to shut the border down because asking for asylum just takes too many resources.\nIt’s not logical, it’s not fair, but Biden isn’t the first president to place politics over principle at the border. Politicians scapegoat asylum seekers and the laws that protect them, however minimally, because they believe it is easier and more attractive to the public to point the finger. Until we all stand up for\ngenuine immigration reform that tackles the tough questions of managing migration flows, ensuring sufficient legal immigration pathways, honoring our protection obligations and valuing immigration as a public good, politicians of both parties will take the easy way out.\nThe president is gambling on a show of strength at the border to counter the authoritarian and xenophobic messages about immigration that Trump has been resurrecting. But suspending entry to the border is a floating craps game that spells disaster for asylum seekers, while undermining the legacy of the Biden administration’s many accomplishments thus far in protecting immigrants and may do little to insulate him from attacks from the far right. The odds are good that nobody wins.\nUp next:\nU.S. democracy is at a dangerous inflection point—from the demise of abortion rights, to a lack of pay equity and parental leave, to skyrocketing maternal mortality, and attacks on trans health.

    "text": "(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\nThe Atlanta Falcons have been the talk of the town in the NFL when it comes to the quarterback position this season.\nThey signed veteran Kirk Cousins to a major four-year deal this offseason before drafting rookie Michael Penix Jr. out of Washington in the first round of the NFL Draft.\nNow, Penix has replaced Cousins as the team’s starter with just a couple of weeks to go in the regular season.\nAccording to insider Aaron Wilson, the franchise has recently made another move at the position: They have signed Emory Jones to the practice squad.\n#Falcons signing quarterback Emory Jones to their practice squad, per a league source @KPRC2 #NFL\n— Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) December 26, 2024\nRaheem Morris’s team is currently sitting in first place in the NFC South at 8-7, as they also own the tiebreaker over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThat is why there has been immediate pressure on Penix to produce.\nIn his first start last week against the New York Giants, he completed 18 of 27 passes for 202 yards and an interception.\nThe team won, but the former All-American will have to perform better this weekend in a Sunday Night Football matchup against the Washington Commanders.\nIf he struggles, the team might have to return to Cousins, which would be awkward in both the locker room and the quarterback room.\nRegarding young Emory Jones, the former Florida Gator is on his second NFL team after spending time with the Ravens last season and the DC Defenders of the UFL.\nIt will be interesting to see how long he stays on the practice squad.",

    "text": "Tony's dramatic walk-off tater delivers sweet, sweet relief to Birdland BALTIMORE -- Once [Anthony Santander](https://www.mlb.com/player/623993)'s walk-off two-run homer had just barely cleared the right-center-field wall -- a heroic ninth-inning blast that lifted the Orioles to a crucial [5-3 win over the Giants](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/giants-vs-orioles/2024/09/19/746985/final/box) on Thursday afternoon -- the emotion poured out from everywhere at Camden Yards. From the fans roaring. From Santander screaming. From his teammates storming the field. This one felt bigger than most. “We needed it -- a lot,” Santander said. Baltimore has scuffled for much of the second half, but especially of late. The O’s (85-68) had lost eight of their previous 10 games, not able to keep pace with the Yankees (89-63) in the [American League East](https://www.mlb.com/orioles/standings/). They were on the cusp of getting swept by San Francisco. Earlier in the day, manager Brandon Hyde lamented how nothing -- not even the wins -- has been coming even remotely easy for his club, owners of a 27-30 record since the All-Star break. This one wasn’t easy, either. The Orioles couldn’t hold onto a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth, as Seranthony Domínguez (perfect over his first nine save chances for the team) blew a save opportunity by giving up a game-tying RBI single to Casey Schmitt. However, the contest remained tied after Gregory Soto entered and got Mark Canha to ground into an inning-ending double play on one pitch. San Francisco turned to right-hander Ryan Walker, who had a 1.77 ERA over 72 appearances this season. Baltimore was about to flip its lineup to the top of the order. This one wasn’t getting away from the O’s. “I thought it felt like the guys were doing everything they can to win this game today,” Hyde said. “Not that they haven’t been, but for me, this was a needed win.” After Emmanuel Rivera struck out to open the bottom of the ninth, Gunnar Henderson knocked a one-out single. Then, Cedric Mullins went down swinging. That set the stage for Santander -- the first-time All-Star who has so often served as the heartbeat of the team during his eight-year tenure in Baltimore. Hyde later admitted he was already starting to think about his pitching plans for extra innings, solely because of Walker’s dominance this season. Others knew this one wouldn’t reach extras. “I told [Ryan] O'Hearn that I thought [Santander] was going to hit a homer,” said rookie [Jackson Holliday](https://www.mlb.com/player/702616), who hit a two-run single during a three-run fourth. “I've seen it. I know kind of how he thinks and his approach, and I thought he was going to hit a slider for a homer.” Santander immediately fell behind, 0-2, but the 29-year-old battled. He took an inside sinker for a ball. Then, he fouled off four consecutive pitches, trying to stay alive while waiting for Walker to make a mistake. It finally came in the form of a 1-2 slider -- as Holliday predicted -- that caught the middle of the plate. Santander jolted the offering to right-center, but many in the ballpark held their breath, not sure if it would clear the fence or land in the glove of a leaping Canha for an inning-ending out. “I was hoping for a wind gust. I was yelling, ‘Blow, blow, blow,’” Hyde said. “I didn’t know if he had enough of it or not.” “I was like this [blows three times]. ‘Keep going. Please,’” Santander said. The Statcast-projected 390-foot blast was enough for a home run, Santander’s career-high 42nd of the season. The pressure was finally off the Orioles a bit. Pandemonium ensued. Santander yelled, “Let’s go!” and flexed his arms, starting the celebration for his third career walk-off home run (and his first of the season). “I let them know that that’s who we are,” Santander said. “That’s a reminder of who we are. Close game. We stay positive. We stay together.” Henderson pumped his fist as he rounded the bases. When Santander turned third and headed for home, he tossed his helmet up into the air -- and Colton Cowser swooped in and caught it, using a leaping snag to keep the team’s energy high. Santander got doused with Gatorade, then jumped up and down with his teammates, grabbing their heads. Heston Kjerstad clutched Santander by the front of the jersey and shook him. O’Hearn rubbed Santander’s scalp, then gave him a hearty high-five. “Orioles Magic” blared over the loudspeakers. “That,” Holliday said, “was an unbelievable win.” This one could provide the positive momentum shift the Orioles have needed. Baltimore has nine games to go in the regular season, and it can clinch a spot in the postseason as soon as Sunday. Even if the O’s don’t catch the Yanks in the AL East to capture a second consecutive division crown, a [Wild Card berth seems likely](https://www.mlb.com/orioles/standings/wild-card/league), especially because they control their own destiny. Get into October, and anything can happen. That’s been proven time and again in baseball. This one could be the start of a special run for the Orioles. “It feels huge. ... It was a breath of fresh air, for sure,” said right-hander Zach Eflin, who allowed two runs in six innings. “I think we’re just trying to find our way the past couple weeks. But if everybody continues to do their job and we can continue to rely on each other and pull for each other -- it’s going to be a lot of fun.”",

Unlike most browser hijackers, which are extensions, MYWeb Watch does not modify browser settings in order to generate redirects to promoted webpages. Instead, this app detects when a Web search is made and produces a redirect in response.\nIt is noteworthy that browser-hijacking software commonly has data-tracking functionalities, and this might apply to MYWeb Watch.\nMYWeb Watch browser hijacker overview\nTypically, browser hijackers make changes to browser settings (e.g., homepages, default search engines, new tab/window URLs, etc.) to promote websites. However, the MYWeb Watch application (installation location – C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Microsoft\\WebWatch) does not modify browsers. Instead, it detects when the Web is searched and generates a redirect to the endorsed site.\nAt the time of research, this app produced redirects leading through the [guardflares.com](/removal-guides/31477-guardflares-com-redirect) fake search engine before landing on another – [potterfun.com](/removal-guides/31253-potterfun-com-redirect).\nMost fraudulent search engines cannot provide search results, so they redirect to legitimate Internet search sites. Potterfun.com is an exception, but the search results generated by this webpage are irrelevant and may include sponsored, untrustworthy, deceptive, and possibly malicious content. It must be mentioned that MYWeb Watch could produce different redirection chains.\nFurthermore, browser hijackers often spy on users' browsing activity, and this might be true of MYWeb Watch. Targeted information may include: visited URLs, viewed pages, searched queries, Internet cookies, usernames/passwords, personally identifiable details, finance-related data, and so on. The collected information can be shared with or sold to third-parties.\nIn summary, the presence of software like MYWeb Watch on devices may result in system infections, severe privacy issues, financial losses, and even identity theft.\nNote that before commencing with MYWeb Watch's removal, as instructed in the guide below, its process must be terminated using Task Manager. It must be emphasized that this browser hijacker has to be eliminated thoroughly, including any files left in its installation folder.\nName | MYWeb Watch redirect |\nThreat Type | Browser Hijacker, Redirect, Search Hijacker, PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program), PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) |\nDetection Names (installer) | Microsoft (Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.H!ml), Rising (Adware.Agent@XH.99F9 (CERT:9d2dlh/drc), Full List Of Detections (\n|\nVirusTotal)[guardflares.com](/removal-guides/31477-guardflares-com-redirect)https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/bf3084600579541ad13f31bf0987c21f633f8164a312a80a22de0e5d831f3c0a/detection)To eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

It can also offer a broad range of useful functionalities; however, these features seldom work as advertised, and in most cases – they do not work at all. Remember that operational functions alone do not prove a software's legitimacy or safety.\nHow did MYWeb Watch install on my computer?\nWe have found several scam pages using pirated movie and adult video download-themed lures to promote MYWeb Watch. Other endorsement techniques are possible. In addition to various scam sites, browser hijackers can have \"official\" promotional webpages.\nMost visitors access these pages via redirects caused by websites employing rogue advertising networks, intrusive ads, [spam browser notifications](/common-types-of-computer-infections#notification-spam), mistyped URLs, and installed [adware](/common-types-of-computer-infections#adware).\nBrowser-hijacking software can also be bundled with ordinary programs. The risk of unintentionally permitting bundled content into the system is increased by downloading from dubious channels (e.g., freeware and free file-hosting websites, Peer-to-Peer sharing networks, etc.) and by treating installations with negligence (e.g., ignoring terms, skipping steps, using \"Easy/Express\" settings, etc.).\nIntrusive advertisements proliferate browser hijackers as well. Once clicked on, some of these adverts can execute scripts to perform downloads/installations without user consent.\nHow to avoid installation of browser hijackers?\nWe highly recommend researching software and downloading it only from official/verified sources. Installation processes must be approached with caution, e.g., by reading terms, exploring possible options, using the \"Custom/Advanced\" settings, and opting out of all additional apps, extensions, features, etc.\nAnother recommendation is to be vigilant while browsing since fraudulent and malicious online content usually appears legitimate and harmless. For example, while intrusive adverts may look innocuous – they redirect to questionable and unreliable websites (e.g., scam-promoting, pornography, gambling, adult dating, etc.).\nIn case of continuous encounters with such ads/redirects, inspect the device and immediately remove all suspicious applications and browser extensions/plug-ins.
