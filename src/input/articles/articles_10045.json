    "title": "Exploring Health Tech’s Impact on Wellness and Self-Care",
    "text": "Picture this: just a few years ago, tech in healthcare was limited to hospital machinery, doctors’ stethoscopes, and maybe a fancy watch that counted steps. Fast forward, and the health tech industry isn’t just booming—it’s reshaping how individuals think about personal health and wellness. It’s no longer just about treating diseases but improving quality of life, from mental wellness apps to AI-driven diagnostics that seem straight out of sci-fi. With every new breakthrough, we’re edging closer to a world where health and technology fuse seamlessly. So, what are the real innovations to watch for? Read on.\nHow are Apps Redefining Wellness and Fitness?\nHealth and fitness apps have come a long way from simple step counters or calorie trackers. Today’s apps are like pocket personal trainers, wellness gurus, and dieticians all rolled into one. They’re designed to do more than just track numbers—they guide, educate, and motivate in ways that feel personal. And unlike a one-size-fits-all program, many of these apps integrate machine learning to get to know you, your habits, and your goals.\nThis shift is so interesting because these apps are increasingly interactive and conversational. It’s not about crunching data but rather about sparking a dialogue. They remind you to stay hydrated, suggest when to take a break, or prompt you for a quick breathing exercise. And it’s working—many users find that these apps don’t just help them stay on track but actually encourage them to care about their well-being in a way that sticks.\nBeyond fitness and mindfulness, these apps are now equipped with tools to support mental health. They help users monitor moods, manage stress, and even provide resources in real-time. They’re proving that wellness isn’t just physical—it’s a whole mindset shift guided right from your pocket.\nIs Mental Health Finally Taking Center Stage?\nThe mental health movement has evolved from a quiet nudge to an all-out shout. In a world where stress and anxiety often take center stage, people have started prioritizing mental well-being just as they do physical health. Enter the explosion of mental health tech: meditation apps, mood trackers, therapy chatbots, and support communities, all available at your fingertips.\nThese tools aren’t just a temporary fix or a superficial solution. They’ve become lifelines for millions, offering resources to anyone, anywhere. The best part? They adapt to your needs, recognizing that mental health isn’t one-size-fits-all. The stigma around mental health issues is slowly dissolving as people openly turn to tech to help manage their emotions and moods, just as they would use an app for physical health.\nFrom AI-based “therapists” that simulate real conversations to wearable devices that track stress levels, mental health tech is bringing awareness and accessibility to the masses. It’s a bold, empathetic approach that meets people where they are and makes well-being a part of everyday life.\nHow Do Wearable Devices Fit into the Bigger Picture?\nWearables have been around for a few years, but they’re just beginning to live up to their full potential. Think of them as digital health coaches that never leave your side. From smartwatches to smart rings, these devices are capable of tracking heart rate, sleep cycles, and even blood oxygen levels, sending real-time updates directly to you—or even your doctor.\nThese little tech marvels are making a huge difference, especially for those managing chronic conditions. Some wearables alert users to sudden health changes, potentially helping them catch issues early. Others send reports to doctors, meaning your healthcare provider has more data on your day-to-day health than ever before.\nBut it’s not just about collecting data—it’s about making that data actionable. Wearables can nudge users towards healthier behaviors, reminding them to move when they’ve been sedentary, guiding them through mindfulness exercises, or alerting them to potential issues. In short, they’re moving from simple tracking devices to preventive tools that could save lives.\nCan EMR Tech Improve Doctor-Patient Relationships?\nOne of the biggest headaches in healthcare is dealing with paperwork and bureaucracy. However, EMR software (electronic medical records) is transforming how medical information is stored, accessed, and shared. Imagine a future where you don’t have to answer the same questions at every doctor’s appointment because your records are always up-to-date, secure, and accessible. That’s what modern EMR tech promises.\nEMR software doesn’t just streamline patient information but can enhance the relationship between doctors and patients. Doctors spend less time buried in paperwork and more time connecting with patients. They can access detailed patient histories, current medications, and past diagnoses at the tap of a screen. The focus shifts from admin tasks to meaningful conversations.\nBeyond that, the latest EMR solutions integrate with other devices, allowing real-time updates from wearables or even remote monitoring tools. Imagine your doctor checking your progress on prescribed exercises through your wearable data or adjusting medication based on health patterns tracked over weeks. That’s the future EMR software is making possible—a future where healthcare feels personal and proactive.\nCould AI Change How Diagnosis Is Approached?\nArtificial intelligence isn’t just a flashy add-on—it’s reshaping the diagnostics landscape in ways that could redefine healthcare entirely. Gone are the days of relying solely on human instinct for diagnoses; AI can analyze vast amounts of data to spot patterns and anomalies that even the most seasoned doctors might miss.\nIn diagnostics, speed can be a matter of life and death. AI’s data-crunching capabilities allow for quicker, more accurate interpretations of test results, which could mean catching diseases earlier than ever. From analyzing X-rays to interpreting lab results, AI tools assist doctors in making faster and more reliable calls.\nThe coolest part? AI isn’t just helping with diagnosis; it’s predicting health outcomes. Some algorithms can look at a person’s health data and forecast potential risks, alerting doctors and patients long before issues escalate. This is preventive care on another level—a proactive, tech-driven approach that could extend and improve lives.\nIs the Future of Health Already Here?\nFrom wearable devices that empower self-care to AI that detects diseases early, these innovations are no longer on the horizon—they’re here, reshaping healthcare from the ground up.\nIn today’s era, health tech isn’t just about medical advancements; it’s about making healthcare accessible, personal, and proactive. So, is health tech ready to transform lives? Perhaps it already has.\nPublished by: Khy Talara",

    "title": "Sisters behind 'A Life of Literature' TikTok step into the publishing business with Bindery",
    "text": "Back in spring 2021, Eyewitness News\nshared the story of two sisters in Britain who were using TikTok to encourage other teens to read.\nMireille and Elodie Lee's\n\"A Life of Literature\" account has grown dramatically since then, and now they're stepping into the publishing business.\nThe Lee sisters' move to become publishers is all more remarkable when you consider Mireille is just 18 years old and Elodie recently turned 16.\nTogether they have found fame promoting the books they love on TikTok and now they are looking to deepen the connection with fans and broaden their reach.\n\"We've been building this audience together on TikTok and Instagram for a long time now,\" said Mireille to Eyewitness News entertainment reporter Sandy Kenyon.\n\"It's been an amazing experience. All of the offers that we have received have been unimaginable,\" said Elodie.\nThe sisters grew up close in Brighton, England.\n\"When we were little, we were obsessed with the library,\" said Mireille.\nThey took to TikTok early, starting \"A Life of Literature\" and encouraging their peers to read the books they love.\n\"And, our love of books is behind our new venture, Bindery,\" added Mireille.\nThe Lee sisters are part of a diverse group under the Bindery umbrella.\nBindery is the brainchild of Matt Kaye.\n\"When I saw what was happening with people like Mireille and Elodie on social media, like how many books they were selling and how passionate their audience was, I got really excited about this idea that they could do even more in the publishing world,\" Kaye said.\nHis new company is a place to interact directly with fans.\nWhat's even more exciting about the new venture is the opportunity for these influencers to become publishers.\n\"We get to give unpublished authors a bigger chance to get their books published because they're just as deserving as the other bigger authors in the industry, but they don't necessarily get that chance,\" said Elodie. \"So that's what Bindery is about and that's what everyone's trying to do on the platform.\"\nOnce a manuscript is accepted for publication, Bindery acts like a traditional publisher when it comes to editing and cover design and the like, but those who follow Mireille, Elodie and the others get to follow along as that process unfolds.\nReaders get to be a part of a book's journey to the point of sale.",

    "title": "Arctic weather satellite's first images capture Storm Boris",
    "text": "Just a month after its launch, ESA's Arctic Weather Satellite has already delivered its first images, notably capturing Storm Boris, which has been wreaking havoc across central Europe. Equipped with a 19-channel cross-track scanning microwave radiometer, the satellite's mission is to penetrate the atmosphere and provide detailed temperature and humidity profiles in all weather conditions.\nDespite its name, the Arctic Weather Satellite measures temperature and humidity at various altitudes around the world. However, its humidity data is particularly valuable for Arctic weather forecasting, as water vapor levels can change rapidly in this region.\nSince it was only launched a month ago on 16 August, the Arctic Weather Satellite is still undergoing rigorous testing of its systems as part of the commissioning phase. However, on 14 September, engineers adjusted their testing schedule to evaluate how well the satellite could measure the effects of Storm Boris.\nTheir efforts certainly have not gone unrewarded.\nThe measurements are shown in terms of \"brightness temperature,\" with lower values (depicted in blue) indicating higher humidity levels. The animation presents these values at 1 km intervals, ranging from 1 km to 7 km above Earth's surface. The torrential rainfall from Storm Boris is especially evident as dark blue regions low in the atmosphere over Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.\nThe animation shows measurements from 14 September 2024 in terms of 'brightness temperature,' with lower values (depicted in blue) indicating higher humidity levels. Credit: European Space Agency This animation uses data captured on a single day, but with thousands of people evacuated and lives lost, the impact of this massive storm now extends from Poland in the north to Italy in the south, and Romania to the east.\nThe Arctic Weather Satellite, developed as a prototype, demonstrates how adopting a \"New Space\" approach—building quickly and at relatively low cost—could be applied to a future constellation of satellites.\nThis constellation, named EPS-Sterna, which ESA would build for Eumetsat, would provide much more frequent coverage of Earth, offering an almost continuous stream of data for short-term weather forecasting, or \"nowcasting.\" In the case of devastating storms like Boris, the advantages are self-evident.\nHowever, the benefits of a constellation of satellites would be especially valuable in the Arctic, a region where humidity levels can change rapidly. Also, the effects of climate change are being felt more in the Arctic compared to other parts of the world. Moreover, what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic so these changes are affecting the Earth system as a whole.\nThis second animation, which uses data acquired on 5 September, provides a broader view of humidity, represented as brightness temperature, and captures another storm over the Arctic, between Greenland and Svalbard. This animation shows humidity at the altitude of 1 km only, but combines data from several of the Arctic Weather Satellite’s passes over the region that day. Credit: European Space Agency Weather satellites in geostationary orbit , positioned 36,000 km above the equator such as the Meteosat series, do not have visibility over higher latitudes , so cannot be used for Arctic weather forecasting. While the MetOp satellites return data over the poles, they can take up to 24 hours to achieve global coverage—which limits data for short-term weather forecasts worldwide.\nAs a demonstrator, the Arctic Weather Satellite is just a single satellite in polar orbit and covers the Arctic in a similar way to MetOp. However, the potential future constellation would dramatically increase the number of daily observations, significantly enhancing coverage not only over the Arctic but also across the rest of the globe.\nThis would enhance weather forecasting, significantly improving safety, reducing economic losses , and providing critical information for decision-making across various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.\nThe third animation uses data from 27 August, when the Arctic Weather Satellite's radiometer had been turned on for the very first time—and remarkably captured a storm over Côte d'Ivoire in West Africa. These data, which use measurements from different altitudes have been overlaid on an image of the same storm from the first geostationary Meteosat Third Generation Imager satellite. Credit: European Space Agency ESA's Arctic Weather Satellite project manager, Ville Kangas, said, \"Although we are still in the process of commissioning the satellite, these initial results have already exceeded our expectations.\n\"The instrument has yet to be thermally stabilized, and the calibration parameters are still being fine-tuned—yet these images clearly demonstrate the Arctic Weather Satellite's unique ability to measure storm activity across different altitude layers through clouds and rain, something that is not achievable with other satellite optical or infrared weather instruments.\"\nSimonetta Cheli, ESA's Director of Earth Observation Programs, added, \"These first results are excellent and we congratulate everyone involved in developing the satellite , which is already demonstrating that the New Space approach of building such a mission will certainly complement our traditionally-built weather satellites.\"\nProvided by European Space Agency\nCitation : Arctic weather satellite's first images capture Storm Boris (2024, September 19) retrieved 19 September 2024 from https://phys.org/news/2024-09-arctic-weather-satellite-images-capture.html This document is subject to copyright.

    "text": "Comité Ejecutivo Nacional de la agrupación reaccionó a insultos del mandatario contra Carlos Felipe García y Alejandro Pacheco\nPUSC condena ataques de Chaves contra 2 de sus diputados\nEl Comité Ejecutivo Nacional del Partido Unidad Social Cristiana (PUSC) condenó los ataques que el presidente, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, lanzó en contra de los diputados de esta agrupación, Carlos Felipe García Molina y Alejandro Pacheco Castro.\nEste miércoles Chaves tildó a García y a Pacheco de “malnacidos y desgraciados” por su postura en favor del 2% para el Fondo Especial para la Educación Superior (FEES).\nPor medio de un comunicado los socialcristianos repudiaron estos insultos y aseguraron que no solo son improcedentes, sino que “minan gravemente el respeto que debe prevalecer entre los poderes de la República”.\n“El comportamiento del presidente Chaves no solo devalúa la investidura de su cargo, sino que también constituye una amenaza para la independencia de la Asamblea Legislativa, un pilar fundamental de nuestra democracia. Es inaceptable que se intente debilitar la labor de los representantes del pueblo con agravios y descalificaciones”, dice el pronunciamiento.\nLa agrupación catalogó el proceder del gobernante como un “show mediático”.\n“Estos shows mediáticos son inaceptables mientras la CCSS atraviesa una crisis, los asesinatos alcanzan niveles históricos, la educación clama por una intervención real, y el narcotráfico se afianza cada vez más en nuestro país”, añade el texto.\nLos socialcristianos exhortaron a Chaves a respetar la labor del Poder Legislativo\n“Reafirmamos nuestro compromiso con la defensa de la democracia y la búsqueda de soluciones reales para los problemas que enfrenta Costa Rica. Gobernar no es ofender, sino liderar con propuestas claras, fomentando la unidad nacional en beneficio de todos los costarricenses”, concluyeron.\nEsto le puede interesar:\n[Nacionales](//www.crhoy.com/noticias-sobre/super).",

Vargas Prado se presenta como un experto en diversas áreas de la salud mental\n, pero las denuncias sugieren que su formación académica no respalda completamente los títulos que utiliza.\nDe acuerdo con el perfil compartido por la cuenta Charlatanes Médicos en X,\nCarlos Alberto Vargas Prado es un individuo que se presenta como psicólogo, psicoanalista, perito y terapeuta, sin embargo, la cuenta afirma que sus afirmaciones carecen de la debida validación en varias de estas áreas.\nAunque tiene una licenciatura en psicología, no hay evidencia de que haya estudiado psicoanálisis o que posea los conocimientos necesarios para desempeñarse como perito en salud mental, ya que en el Registro Nacional de Profesionales,\nse le ve una cédula de licenciatura en Psicología, licenciatura en Ciencias de la Comunicación y una maestría en docencia.\nAdemás de estas inconsistencias académicas, la denuncia cobra mayor relevancia debido a una acusación preocupante:\nCarlos Alberto Vargas Prado sería paciente del Hospital Psiquiátrico Fray Bernardino Álvarez, lo que, según la cuenta Charlatanes Médicos\n,\nle permitiría adquirir conocimientos sobre medicamentos psiquiátricos\n, los cuales presuntamente estaría recetando a personas sin contar con la formación ni autorización necesarias para hacerlo.\nVargas ha sido acusado de plagio\nA pesar de sus limitaciones en cuanto a formación, Vargas Prado ha manifestado su intención de impartir cursos relacionados con el psicoanálisis y el peritaje. Un aspecto que\nha generado controversia en torno a su figura es una denuncia presentada por el Colectivo Ananké en 2018, que lo acusó de plagiar textos y artículos de otros investigadores en el campo de la salud mental.\nHasta ahora, las autoridades sanitarias mexicanas no han emitido un pronunciamiento oficial sobre el caso de Carlos Alberto Vargas Prado, esto ha llevado a muchos a cuestionar la regulación de los profesionales de la salud mental en el país, así como la efectividad de plataformas como Doctoralia, que permiten a personas sin las credenciales necesarias promocionar sus servicios.\nEncuentra Diario Plano Informativo en formato digital aquí.",

    "title": "Shadowy ad cabal GARM shuts down after Elon Musk’s X files antitrust suit over censorship",
    "text": "By Thomas Barrabi ,\n1 hour ago\nThe left-leaning advertising cabal accused of conspiring to suppress conservative outlets was reportedly disbanded Thursday – just days after Elon Musk’s X slapped the group with a federal antitrust lawsuit .\nThe World Federation of Advertisers, which organized the Global Alliance for Responsible Media initiative, informed its members that GARM was “discontinuing” activities, according to an email obtained by Business Insider .\nWFA CEO Stephen Loerke said in his email the decision to shutter GARM was “not made lightly,” and cited the initiative’s status as a nonprofit with limited resources.\nGARM came under fire last month after a damning House Judiciary Committee alleged its radical executive Robert Rakowitz coordinated a campaign to stifle free speech and restrict ads to a slew of news outlets and online platforms, including The Post.\nIn its bombshell lawsuit earlier this week, X accused GARM and WFA of organizing an illegal ad boycott that cost the social media platform “billions of dollars in advertising revenue.”\nAside from GARM and WFA, a handful of major companies — CVS Health, Mars, Orsted and Unilever – were named as defendants. X is seeking trebled compensatory damages and injunctive relief.\nGoogle, Meta hatched secret deal to target teens on YouTube with Instagram ads: report\nThe WFA’s membership includes dozens of the world’s largest companies, including Disney, Coca-Cola and Adidas, that collectively control 90% of global marketing spending, according to its website.\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino said GARM’s shutdown was “an important acknowledgement and a necessary step in the right direction.”\n“No small group should be able to monopolize what gets monetized,” she added in her post to the social media site.\nGARM is an initiative of the World Federation of Advertisers. Loerke said in the email that WFA and GARM would still fight X’s lawsuit in Texas federal court and expressed confidence that the outcome would “demonstrate our full adherence to competition rules in all our activities.”\nWhen reached for comment, a WFA spokesperson said the group would share a statement on its decision “shortly.”\nIn an interview with The Post, House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) called GARM’s demise “great news for freedom, free markets, First Amendment, all the good things that make America special.”\nHouse demands info from dozens of major businesses over ties to shadowy ad cartel GARM in collusion probe over free speech\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) described the shutdown as “great news.” Nathan Posner/Shutterstock Jordan said the committee’s investigation is ongoing and remains focused on potential antitrust violations.\n“The World Federation of Advertisers, we think, has the same bias,” Jordan said. “Our investigation is looking at all of that. It’s all about stopping the censorship however it’s done.”\nAs The Post reported last week , the House Judiciary Committee sent out letters to more than 40 companies to provide information and preserve documents related to the inquiry.\nAdidas, American Express, Bayer, BP, Carhartt, Chanel, CVS and General Motors were among the companies that received letters.\nGARM chief Robert Rakowitz was heavily scrutinized in the House report. AWNewYork/Shutterstock Separately, at least two Republican state attorneys general are known to be examining evidence surfaced by the House and weighing possible legal action.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\nRakowitz actions have drawn heavy scrutiny in the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation.\nIn one internal email obtained by the panel’s investigators, Rakowitz appeared to brag that X was “80% below revenue forecasts” since GARM targeted Musk over brand safety issues.\nRakowitz later claimed the email was meant as a “self-effacing joke.”\nX’s Linda Yaccarino described GARM’s shutdown as “an important acknowledgement and a necessary step in the right direction.” Getty Images GARM is also said to have exhibited bias against the Daily Wire, Fox News, comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience” and other outlets accused of spreading disinformation.\nThe House Judiciary’s report said GARM relied on tools such as the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), a London-based group that in 2022 unveiled an ad blacklist of 10 news outlets whose opinion sections tilted conservative or libertarian, including The Post, RealClearPolitics and Reason magazine.\nThe House committee’s probe is centered on whether GARM, WFA and its members violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which governs illegal restraint of trade.\nGARM and WFA denied wrongdoing. A spokesperson for the organizations previously said allegations of anti-competitive behavior are “unfounded.”\nFor top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "La polizia di Catania ha denunciato un 53enne per inottemperanza a un ordine legalmente dato dall'autorità. L'uomo è il proprietario di un cavallo sottoposto a vincolo sanitario di cui si sono perse le tracce.\n Gli investigatori sospettano che possa essere quello rimasto vittima di un grave incidente e che, durante una corsa clandestina, mentre trainava un calesse con due persone a bordo, è pesantemente caduto sull'asfalto, all'altezza del torna indietro del tondo Gioeni della circonvallazione, riportando gravi ferite e una copiosa perdita di sangue.\n I due uomini che erano a bordo del calesse, e un terzo che li seguiva a bordo di uno scooter incitando il cavallo a correre sempre più veloce, hanno fatto arrivare sul posto un veicolo per il trasporto animali, caricando a bordo, con non poche difficoltà, il cavallo che zoppicava vistosamente. Successivamente si sono allontanati dal luogo dell'incidente per eludere il controllo della polizia municipale che era subito intervenuta perché poco distante ed era stata informata da cittadini. Tutta la scena è stata ripresa da telecamere del sistema di sicurezza attivo a Catania. Agenti della squadra a Cavallo, visionando le immagini di telecamere di sicurezza, grazie alla loro conoscenza del territorio, hanno riconosciuto il cavallo di colore bianco perché alcune settimane era stato sottoposto e sottoposto a vincolo sanitario dalla polizia su disposizione dei veterinari dell'Asp e gli era stato applicato un microchip. Un controllo nella stalla di Catania dove l'animale sarebbe dovuto custodito ha dato esito negativo. Il proprietario ha detto agli investigatori che il cavallo era stato spostato in un altro luogo, ma non ricordava né dove né quando, confermando i sospetti dei poliziotti che sarebbe stato fatto sparire per evitare di incorrere in sanzioni più gravi.\n Secondo gli investigatori il cavallo, a causa delle gravi ferite, è morto o è stato soppresso e destinato alla macellazione perché non più utilizzabile per le corse clandestine.",

    "text": "Want to find out what information your internet-connected car is collecting about you and your passengers, and sending back to the overseas manufacturer—and possibly to third parties?\nSome carmakers make it hard to find out. In one case, understanding the data policies required reading over 40,000 words spread across five documents.\nThis troubling insight comes from a new study by Associated Professor Katherine Kemp of the Law and Justice Department at the University of New South Wales, Driving Blind: The Unexamined Privacy Risks of Connected Cars.\nKemp says it is another reason why Australia needs “urgent reform of privacy laws.”\nMany of the reasons your car is watching your every move are benign or even positive: it might detect an accident and call emergency services or notify you if you inadvertently leave a child in the back seat.\nHowever, all 15 cars in the study go beyond helpful uses, collecting data that can reveal a lot about the driver but is of no use to them, yet could be valuable to overseas car manufacturers and a range of third parties, including government agencies and insurance companies.\nDifficulties Finding Information\nWhile data collection and storage are probably low on a buyer’s list of priorities—if they’re considered at all—the report says even tech-aware consumers would find “enormous obstacles” in finding and understanding privacy terms.“Some brands also make inaccurate claims that certain information is not ‘personal information,’ implying the Privacy Act doesn’t apply to that data,” Kemp said.\n“Some are also repurposing personal information for ’marketing‘ or ’research,’ and sharing data with third parties.”\nIn addition to monitoring the car, manufacturers often require drivers to download an app to access various “connected services.”\n- heat, cool, lock, or unlock the car\n- locate the parked car using headlights and horn\n- check fuel levels and tyre pressure\n- use the car’s internal and external cameras to view its surroundings and interior.\n“It could be disclosed to insurers or data brokers without [a person’s] consent,” she said.\n“It could facilitate crimes, including domestic violence, stalking, and robbery.\nNational Security Risks\nThis year, the[White House issued a warning](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/23/fact-sheet-protecting-america-from-connected-vehicle-technology-from-countries-of-concern/)that “certain hardware and software in connected vehicles enable the capture of information about geographic areas or critical infrastructure and present opportunities for malicious actors to disrupt the operations of infrastructure or the cars themselves.”\n“Commerce has determined that certain technologies used in connected vehicles from [Communist China] and Russia present particularly acute threats,” it said.\n“These countries of concern could use critical technologies within our supply chains for surveillance and sabotage to undermine national security.”\nWhen consumers try to find out what data their vehicle is collecting and where it is being sent, they are directed to an average of three documents totalling around 14,000 words per brand—if they can find them.\n“Hurdles for consumers included missing privacy terms, unhelpful interfaces, and significant errors in published privacy policies,” Kemp said.\nPrivacy Terms For Major Brands\n⊗ = not available ⊕ = mixed ⊕ = availableBrand | Full Privacy Terms Reasonably Available on Australian Website | Connected Privacy Terms: Number of Documents | Connected Privacy Document Word Count |\nAudi | ⊗ | 5 | 26,901 |\nBMW | ⊕ | 5 | 41,495 |\nBYD | ⊕ | 3 | 13,225 |\nFord | ⊕ | 2 | 16,980 |\nGWM | ⊗ | 3 | 10,866 |\nHonda | ⊕ | 3 | 14,162 |\nHyundai | ⊕ | 2 | 5,255 |\nKia | ⊗ | 2 | 3,087 |\nLexus | ⊕ | 3 | 12,625 |\nMazda | ⊗ | 2 | 4,862 |\nMercedes | ⊗ | 5 | 18,510 |\nMG | ⊕ | 1 | 3,524 |\nTesla | ⊕ | 1 | 7,400 |\nToyota | ⊕ | 3 | 16,808 |\nVolvo | ⊕ | 4 | 13,716 |\nKemp says several major brands fail to recognise the full scope of personal information protected by the Privacy Act.\n“They claim that certain information ‘does not, on its own, personally identify’ the consumer, and they can use this for ‘any purpose,’” she explained.\nData Matching Allows Identification\nFor example, a map of a person’s precise location may not identify them on its own, but when combined with their home and work addresses or location history on their mobile phone, it can be linked to an individual. This data could then reveal:- Children’s schools\n- Occupation\n- Family and relationship status\n- Political opinions or religious affiliations\n- Use of legal, medical, rehabilitation, and family planning services\n- Involvement in sex work and other services\n- Specific individuals in the car and their interactions\n- Planned activities\n- Political and religious views\n- Racial or ethnic origin\n- Whether the driver is alone\nThe introduction of the technology in Australia has lagged behind other countries, notably the European Union and the United States. However, Austroads predicts that 93 percent of new car sales in Australia will be connected cars by 2031.\nIn 2023, the Mozilla Foundation analysed connected car privacy terms in the United States—where 63.4 percent of licensed drivers have connected cars and 91 percent of all new car sales include the feature—and concluded it was a “privacy nightmare on wheels.”",
