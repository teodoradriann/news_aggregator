    "title": "Kanye West admits he ‘was drinking’ when he tweeted about going ‘DEFCON 3 on Jewish people’",
    "text": "Eminem has taken aim at Sean &#039;Diddy&#039; Combs and Kanye West in his new album Kanye West has admitted to being under the influence of alcohol while sending anti-semitic tweets in 2022. The rapper faced controversy after writing on Twitter (now named X) that he was going “death con 3 on Jewish people.” West’s account was temporarily locked as a result and the tweet was deleted by the platform. “I was drinking when I put up the DEFCON tweet,” West said in a newly-shared 2022 interview with Candace Owens on her podcast Candace. DEFCON is an acronym that refers to the state of alert of America’s militaries. West continued: “You wanna know what alcohol I had inside me? Hennessy. It turns us gray. The demons [come out].” When asked why he didn’t explain that he was intoxicated earlier, West said he didn’t want to be “discredited” because he still considered the comments his “truth.” His sentiments led Adidas to sever ties with West and end its lucrative Yeezy footwear partnership, calling the comments “unacceptable, hateful, and dangerous.” Clothing brand Gap, which had also collaborated with the rapper on a clothing line, stopped stocking products affiliated with West. Kanye West has faced intense backlash over anti-semitic comments dating back to 2022 (Getty Images) West’s anti-Jewish rhetoric intensified in December 2022, when he said there were “good things” about Hitler in an interview with right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Following the interview, West also posted an image of a swastika blended with a Star of David. West later apologized to the Jewish community in December 2023. In a statement written in Hebrew and posted on his Instagram account, he said (as translated by Google): “I sincerely apologise to the Jewish community for any unintended outburst caused by my words or actions. It was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused. I am committed to starting with myself and learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding in the future.” “Your forgiveness is important to me, and I am committed to making amends and promoting unity,” he added. West is currently facing a series of lawsuits linked to his anti-semitic behavior. Earlier this year, former Yeezy employee Trevor Phillips sued the star, claiming discrimination, a hostile work environment, whistleblower retaliation and unsafe working conditions, among other allegations. In February, West claimed that Adidas was suing him for a further $250m.",

    "title": "Ukrainian grain ship hits Russian mine in Black Sea",
    "text": "A Panama-flagged civilian cargo vessel is seen in Ukraine’s Odesa region, December 2023.\nA civilian cargo ship struck a Russian mine in the Black Sea near Ukraine’s Danube ports on Thursday, officials and analysts said, in an incident that underscored the dangers faced by those exporting Ukrainian grain during the war.\nThe Panama-flagged vessel struck the floating mine during stormy weather as it went to pick up grain, according to Ukraine’s Southern Defence Forces, adding that churning seas often increase the risk from mines.\nTwo sailors were reportedly injured.\nAs the fighting grinds on through the winter and likely into a third year after Russia’s February 2022 invasion, and with little recent change along the front line, Ukraine is aiming to strengthen its financial resources for what could be a protracted war.\nAfter Russia pulled out of a U.N.-brokered export agreement last summer, Ukraine launched a new Black Sea shipping corridor to get grain, metals and other cargo to world markets. That has given a boost to Ukraine’s agriculture-dependent economy.\nThe mine incident occurred about 130 kilometres south-west of Chornomorsk, which is near Odesa on Ukraine’s southern coast, the Ambrey maritime risk analysis company said. The ship with 18 crew was on its way to Izmail, another port in the area.\nThe mine detonated at the ship’s stern, causing equipment and machinery failure and resulting in the vessel losing power, Ambrey said.\nThe captain reportedly manoeuvred into shallow water to prevent the ship from sinking.\nThe incident comes as the future of the war hangs in the balance, with Ukraine’s key Western allies struggling to keep their electorates and political opponents on board with supporting Kyiv.\nUkraine’s much-anticipated counteroffensive last summer ultimately failed to shift the front line despite the deployment of billions of dollars in Western weaponry.\nThat has given confidence to the Kremlin’s forces, especially as the future of Western aid is in question and the conflict in Israel and Gaza drives Ukraine down the news agenda.\nHowever, as US legislators wrangle over how much aid to send to Ukraine and for how long, a key Washington think tank has argued that the front line is not currently “a stable stalemate.”\nIn an assessment released late on Wednesday, the Institute for the Study of War assessed that “the current balance can be tipped in either direction by decisions made in the West or in Russia, and limited Russian gains could become significant especially if the West cuts off military aid to Ukraine.”\nMeanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested that the US and European Union countries plan to continue sending help to the Ukrainian government.\n“Neither Washington nor Brussels refrain from assisting the Kyiv regime because they realise it would be doomed without such assistance,” Lavrov said in an interview with state news agency Tass.\n“They remain committed to containing Russia at the expense of Ukrainians and their lives.”",
