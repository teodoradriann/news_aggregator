    "text": "自发售以来，英伟达的RTX 50系列显卡在市场竞争中稍显落后，其性能未达预期、过热问题、定价偏高以及供应短缺，使得该系列显卡的表现堪称灾难性。\n如今，这家图形技术巨头计划通过即将推出的RTX 50 Super系列显卡来修正部分错误。为此，据爆料英伟达下调了RTX 50 Super显卡的售价，使其与基础版50系显卡的原始定价持平，同时提供性能提升的优势。\n根据RedGamingTech的消息，RTX 5080 Super的新定价为999美元（约7100元人民币），相比此前1149美元（约8250元人民币）的价格大幅下调了150美元。RTX 5070 Ti Super也将获得100美元的降价，而RTX 5070 Super的定价将仅为549美元（约4000元人民币）。\n此前有报道称，这些Super显卡将获得显存（VRAM）的大幅升级，容量提升高达50%。鉴于基础版Blackwell GPU最大的问题就是显存不足，这是一个非常受欢迎的升级。因此，RTX 5080 Super和RTX 5070 Ti Super都将配备24GB GDDR7显存，而RTX 5070 Super则将配备18GB GDDR7显存。\n此次降价源于英伟达方面的供应过剩以及50系显卡的销量不佳，预计针对基础版RTX 50 GPU的修订（可能指降价或调整）或将于本月开始。英伟达希望RTX 50 GPU的库存能尽快售罄，因为该公司计划在2025年第四季度（Q4 2025） 发布RTX 50 Super系列显卡，这距离最初的RTX 50 GPU发布还不到一年时间。\n如果该泄露信息准确的话，你们计划购买 RTX 50 Super 系列显卡吗？欢迎来评论区讨论。",

    "text": "Karachi Jamaat-e-Islami interim emir Munam Zafar said on Thursday that Karachi, being Pakistan’s economic hub, should lead to the country’s advancement; however, in the last one and a half to two years, thousands have fallen victim to lawlessness here. “In 2023 alone, 90,000 criminal incidents occurred, and so far in 2025 there have been 17,000 crimes, with 224 people murdered,” Zafar said while speaking to a press conference. He held the Pakistan Peoples Party government and law enforcement agencies were responsible for the situation. “It is the chief minister’s responsibility; it’s been 16 years under the PPP rule, yet peace has not been established.” The JI leader said that for the past 32 years, the city had been lifting corpses, industries had moved out, and people had left. When people’s lives were secure, they would engage in business, he said, adding that during Ramazan this year, 19 people were murdered. “The chief minister must order law enforcement agencies to maintain peace in the city. If the situation doesn’t change, there will be protests at the Chief Minister’s House and Police Headquarters,” he said. Zafar demanded an efficient transport system, availability of electricity and water for Karachi, saying that the federal and provincial governments instead of making verbal commitments should ensure these essentials for the Karachiites. There were 14-hour power outages in the city, he said. The picture shows a pharmacy. — AFP/FileThe Karachi administration has launched a campaign to check the expiry dates...

    "text": "Mercenaries from the Wagner Group are becoming more violent and killing more people one year after the death of the paramilitary group’s leader. Since Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash in August 2023, there’s been an 81% increase in violence involving Russian mercenaries in Mali, one of the West African countries where the group has deployed fighters, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a non-governmental organization that monitors conflicts globally. At the same time, the number of fatalities has surged 65%, it said. Violence has also surged in Niger and Burkina Faso, which like Mali brought in Wagner after military coups led to the withdrawal of European forces and United Nations peacekeepers from the region last year. All three countries have been facing decade-long Islamic insurgencies, though the mercenaries have done little to turn the tide. “The Sahelien regimes view the Wagner Group’s presence as a win-win,” Heni Nsaibia, Acled’s associate analysis coordinator for West Africa, said in the report, referring to how the mercenaries help keep the juntas in power. “In Mali, they pay $10 million a month for protection. That’s more than they spend on the budgets for major ministries like justice, family affairs, or environment.” In the Central African Republic, where Wagner deployed in 2019, the group has been particularly dangerous to civilians, with the reported number of people killed by Russian mercenaries this year already exceeding the total for all of 2023, according to data compiled by ACLED. In all four countries, Wagner has continued to operate alongside and with the Africa Corps, a mercenary group under the control of Russia’s defense ministry that began recruiting shortly after Prigozhin’s death. ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.
