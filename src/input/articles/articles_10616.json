    "title": "A's closer Mason Miller goes on IL with fractured left pinky - ESPN",
    "text": "The subject of trade rumors as Tuesday's deadline approaches, [Oakland Athletics](/mlb/team/_/name/oak/oakland-athletics) All-Star right-handed closer [Mason Miller](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4730225/mason-miller) landed on the 15-day injured list on Thursday with a fracture of his left pinky finger. The move is retroactive to Tuesday. To fill Miller's spot on the 40-man roster, the A's activated right-hander Ross Stripling (elbow) to start Thursday night's series opener against the host [Los Angeles Angels](/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels). Per MLB.com, Miller broke the finger while preparing to exercise in the trainers' room inside the A's clubhouse after Monday's win over the [Houston Astros](/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros). The rookie placed his left hand on the training table in an awkward position, causing the injury. Miller had sealed the 4-0 victory with an 11-pitch, 1-2-3 ninth inning. However, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Miller was apparently frustrated about something after the game and pounded his left hand on a table. Miller, 25, has five years of team control remaining after this season, but his electrifying stuff has contenders interested in obtaining his services. In 34 appearances in 2024, he is 1-1 with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves and leads all relievers with 70 strikeouts in 40 2/3 innings. Miller also leads MLB with 306 pitches at 100 mph or harder and broke the record for the fastest pitch in All-Star Game history at 103.6 mph (since pitch-tracking began in 2008). He fired a perfect inning, striking out [Shohei Ohtani](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani) and [Trea Turner](https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner) en route to earning the win. Since making his major league debut with Oakland last season, Miller is 1-4 with a 2.92 ERA in 44 games (six starts) with 15 saves and 108 strikeouts in 74 innings.

    "title": "Britain’s Jews are being terrorised",
    "text": "Britain’s Jews are being terrorised\nThe knife attack in Golders Green is merely the most shocking expression of the surge in anti-Semitism.\nAnti-Semitism has surged in the UK since the Hamas pogrom in southern Israel on 7 October last year.\nEarlier this week, a man wielding a knife threatened the staff of Kay’s kosher supermarket on Hamilton Road in the Golders Green district of London. He\nreportedly entered the shop and demanded to know where the staff stood on ‘Israel and Palestine’.\nFortunately, the shop staff bravely forced him to leave, using trolleys and broomsticks to keep him at bay, before he was later arrested. As a video of part of the confrontation shows, they can be heard shouting ‘yesh lo sakin’ (he has a knife) in Hebrew. According to the police, ‘a 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, criminal damage and racially aggravated affray’.\nTragically, this was no isolated incident. A few weeks ago, three Israelis – two men and a woman – were\nattacked in London’s Leicester Square after their assailants heard them speaking Hebrew. The two men suffered head injuries as a result.\nAlso in London last month,\na group of masked men mobbed a Jewish charity event for disaffected young boys. The men tried to break into the charity’s office in Hendon, north London but were blocked by police. They were also filmed abusing Jewish passers-by. Apparently, they had got wind that an Israeli soldier would be addressing the boys (his talk was on how to overcome adversity and avoid taking drugs).\nThe UK statistics on anti-Semitism paint a grim picture. Figures from the Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that protects British Jews, show a 524 per cent\nincrease in anti-Semitic incidents between 7 October and the middle of December last year.\nThis trend is not restricted to Britain. In America, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)\nreported a 337 per cent increase in anti-Semitic incidents between 7 October and 11 December. The ADL has also collated national data on anti-Semitic incidents in the weeks following Hamas’s pogrom from several countries around the world. They show a 738 per cent increase in Australia, a 300 per cent increase in Austria, a 961 per cent increase in Brazil, a 1,000 per cent increase in France, a 320 per cent increase in Germany and an 818 per cent increase in the Netherlands. The statistics were calculated over different time periods, but they all show a sharp upward trend.\nMore alarming still is that this surge in anti-Semitic hate is coming from a relatively high base. In Britain, the number of anti-Semitic incidents has\nbeen on an upward trend for at least the past decade, punctuated by sharp spikes whenever conflict involving Israel and Palestine flares up.\nThe American statistics show a similar pattern.\nAccording to the ADL, the number of anti-Semitic incidents rose from 751 in 2013 to 3,697 in 2022.\nSome will no doubt try to argue that the issue here is not anti-Semitism, but rather that people are frustrated with Israel or are expressing opposition to Zionism. But this does not wash. If your opposition to Israel leads you to attack or agitate against Jews, then your ‘opposition to Israel’ is just anti-Semitism rebranded.\nThere is a clear line between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism. If someone chants ‘Free Palestine’ on a protest that is not in and of itself anti-Semitic. Nor is holding a placard bearing the same message. Having debates about the Israel-Palestine conflict, whichever side different individuals take, is not racist, either.\nBut\ndaubing ‘Free Palestine’ in an area of London with a large Jewish community is undoubtedly anti-Semitic. Attacking a Jewish school boy in London in an attempt to force him to chant ‘Free Palestine’ is anti-Semitic. Screaming ‘fucking Jews’ at Londoners putting up posters about Israeli hostages in Gaza is clearly anti-Semitic. And, for the avoidance of doubt, entering a Jewish supermarket wielding a knife and demanding to discuss Israel and Palestine is most definitely anti-Semitic.\nAnyone who refuses to recognise that anti-Semitism now poses a serious problem has, at best, lost their moral compass. At worst, they themselves might be part of the problem.\nDaniel Ben-Ami is an author and journalist. He runs the website\nRadicalism of Fools, dedicated to rethinking anti-Semitism.

    "text": "More on KentOnline Rishi Sunak joined international condemnation of Vladimir Putin, after Russia launched a massive aerial barrage against Ukraine. Russia launched 122 missiles and 36 drones against Ukrainian targets, killing at least 13 civilians in what military officials said was the biggest aerial barrage of the war so far. The Ukrainian air force intercepted 87 of the missiles and 27 of the Shahed-type drones overnight, officials said. The Prime Minister, in a post on social media, said: “These widespread attacks on Ukraine’s cities show Putin will stop at nothing to achieve his aim of eradicating freedom and democracy. “We will not let him win. “We must continue to stand with Ukraine – for as long as it takes.” Fighting along the front line has been largely bogged down by winter weather after Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive failed to make a significant breakthrough along the roughly 620-mile line of contact. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has spent recent weeks urging western allies to provide the country with more air defences to protect itself against such aerial attacks. It comes as signs of war fatigue strain efforts to keep support in place. Mr Zelensky said the Kremlin’s forces used a wide variety of weapons, including ballistic and cruise missiles. “Today, Russia used nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal,” Mr Zelensky said on X, formerly known as Twitter.",

    "text": "If you have any plans for the last day of 2023, the weather is looking fantastic!\nHigh pressure is building in today, which will bring us more sunshine through New Year’s Day. It will also reinforce the chilly air mass over us.\nIt’s a chilly start, with most back yeards dipping into the 40s, with some in southern communities still in the 50s. Other than a few clouds in the morning, Sunday will be a much sunnier day— yet cool. Highs will struggle to get out of the 60s.\nWith the clear sky and cooler conditions, the last sunset of the year should be fantastic! The sun goes down at 5:45 on Sunday. Shortly after it gets dark, you can expect it to get pretty chilly.\nYou’ll want to dress warm on NYE if you plan on heading to the Fort Myers ball drop or being outside to watch fireworks. Temperatures are forecast to fall below 50 after midnight. It will stay cold through the sunrise on Monday, with temperatures rebounding near 70 later in the day.\nYou won’t need the umbrella through much of the week. Our next rainmaker arrives Thursday and quickly moves out by Friday.\nHope you have a fun and safe end to the year!",

    "text": "Raf, 9, developed extremely deadly cancer in 2021He is now cancer free thanks to 'lifeline' treatment READ MORE: Aussie punk rocker's son has cancer\nAn ‘ordinary’ seven-year-old boy found out he had stage four cancer after he complained of a simple belly ache after a day of play.\nRaf spent his seventh birthday running around with friends and family before telling his mum, Natalie Oaten, that his stomach hurt in October 2021.\nShe took him to the doctors where Raf walked out with a low-grade urinary tract infection diagnosis and a prescription for antibiotics.\nHowever, when the little boy continued to complain of discomfort they went to Lismore Base Hospital in NSW where scans revealed Raf had stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of childhood cancer.\nNow nine and cancer-free, but with a 50 per cent chance of relapse, Raf is gearing up to celebrate Christmas with his family who have since made it their mission to raise awareness for the ‘lifeline’ treatment that saved their little boy.\nRaf was celebrating his seventh birthday in 2021 when he complained of a stomach ache that turned out to be stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer\nHis mother, Natalie Oaten, (pictured together) rushed him to the Queensland Children’s Hospital where he began an extensive 20 month treatment program\nDuring the height of the pandemic, Ms Oaten rushed Raf from Lismore, NSW to the Queensland Children’s Hospital.\nThey were separated from family in Brisbane while borders were closed.\n‘That turned into four months of not seeing my husband or my other son because they couldn’t cross the border at the time,’ Ms Oaten told 7News.\nRaf spent more than 20 months in treatment interstate – away from his father and his siblings.\nFor almost two years Raf’s brother would see his father crying in the shower while it remained unclear if the cancer would prove fatal.\nAt one point Raf was in ‘so much pain that you could not touch him’ and he lost mobility in one side, his mother said.\nHe underwent multiple sessions of chemotherapy, radiation treatments, surgeries and stem cell transplants.\nHowever, the break-came after Raf started a new type of immunotherapy called dinutuximab, which his family believe saved his life.\nSince being cleared by doctors, Raf and his family have been advocating for the treatment as experts continue research at the Ian Frazer Centre for Children’s Immunotherapy Research in Queensland.\nThe Oatens are now advocating for the ‘lifeline’ treatment that the claim saved Raf – a new type of immunotherapy called dinutuximab which helps immune systems destroy cancer cells\nImmunotherapy was effective for Raf because it helped his immune system destroy cancer cells, but typically it is not used to treat children.\nMs Oaten said that by raising awareness for the treatment her family hopes other children with high-risk neuroblastoma might be able to access it.\nThe research comes with a hefty price tag, but if just one per cent of Australians donated $5 it would make all the difference, the mother said.\n‘Cancer is hard and it’s confronting and it’s not pretty. You lose people in droves and suddenly your village becomes really lonely,’ she said.\n‘We still don’t know where we’re going to be two, five or 10 years from here, so I’ll be damned if I stand there and say that we’ve beaten this… we’re going to live with this for the rest of our lives.’",

    "text": "Superbonus 110% che agguanta il via libera da parte del Consiglio dei ministri. La recente notizia riporta della messa a punto di iniziative mirate che vanno a toccare il Superbonus 110% e il Sismabonus. L’obiettivo del Governo è stato quello di andare a tutelare la fascia degli italiani più deboli, che non dovranno restituire soldi. Ecco le novità in arrivo.\nPhoto by neelam279 – Pixabay\nSuperbonus: messo finalmente a punto un decreto risolutivo A quanto pare sono finiti i giorni di passione per i cantieri rimasti in panne nel corso della definizione del Superbonus 110%. È stato messo a punto nelle ultime ore un Decreto che consentirà di portare a termine le lavorazioni o di definire un SAL minimo al 30% per poter accedere con facilità alla detrazione fiscale del 110%.\nEcco quindi che Palazzo Chigi ci tiene a sottolineare che in merito al Superbonus non verrà formulata nessuna proroga nonostante una parte della maggioranza l’abbia invocata a gran voce. Di contro si è giunti alla stesura di un decreto apposito che vada in aiuto ai cittadini italiani che presentino redditi molto bassi, e si trovano ad avere cantieri ancora aperti, senza la detrazione del 110%.\nInfatti sono proprio loro che stavano rischiando di dover restituire i crediti fiscali maturati, a partire dal 1° gennaio 2024, a causa dei lavori edili ancora non portati a compimento.\nPhoto by 652234 – Pixabay\nChi rientra nel decreto Il provvedimento messo a punto dal Cdm nelle ultime ore, di fatto si rivolge a tutti i lavori edili che in possesso di certificazione, si sono svolti nel 2023, e che non risulteranno essere chiusi allo scadere del 31 dicembre prossimo. Ciò andrà di fatto a porre la parola fine al Superbonus 110% così come lo conosciamo.\nL’incentivo fiscale è costato alle casse dello Stato 100 milioni di euro, e con tale provvedimento non si vedrà salire ulteriormente tale tetto della spesa pubblica. Contestualmente nella stessa sede il Cdm ha messo delle limitazioni ben precise che andranno a riguardare gli alti incentivi edilizi come il Sismabonus, e quello riguardante l’abbattimento delle barriere architettoniche.\nPhoto by 652234 – Pixabay\nScattano gli aiuti alle fasce di reddito più basse Durante il lungo dibattimento a Palazzo Chigi si sono andati a definire anche mirati aiuti economici a supporto degli italiani che presentino un ISEE fino a 15 mila euro. Il decreto per tale situazione prevede una proroga dell’agevolazione al 110% andando a definire un Fondo povertà.\nCon tale provvedimento si farà fronte alle spese assunte dal 1° gennaio 2024 fino al 31 ottobre, che non siano più coperte dall’agevolazione del 110%, ma solo al 70%. Ecco quindi che le fasce degli italiani rientranti nei redditi più bassi, potranno contare sull’integrazione economica messa a punto dal Governo.\nPer avere diritto a tale supporto però lo stato avanzamento dei lavori non dovrà essere inferiore al 60% del volume complessivo. A determinare i dettagli del Fondo che verrà finanziato a tal riguardo, entrerà in gioco il Mef che avrà il compito di andare a reperire le risorse necessarie, andando ad attingere ad altri fondi già in essere.\nAttualmente la cifra adisposizione per poter intervenire a tal riguardo è stimata su 16 milioni di euro. Con tale provvedimento potranno tirare un sospiro di sollievo gran parte italiani che si sono trovati ad oggi ad avere ancora cantieri aperti, e lavori edili non portati a compimento al 31 dicembre 2023.\nNuovo accordo Superbonus: foto e immagini\nCostruttore\nEuro\nEdilizia, Costruzioni\nSoldi, Casa\nEdilizia\nEdilizia\nLeggi anche Ecobonus 110% cessione credito banche: come ristrutturare casa gratis",
