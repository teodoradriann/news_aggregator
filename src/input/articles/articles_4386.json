It can be thought that the gaze from an evil eye can disturb your Power fields and so triggering harm or distress. It is actually believed that considering that toddlers Have got a weaker energy industry, These are additional at risk of evil eye.\nIn keeping with A different legend, Shiva himself designed Bhairava. There was a horrible demon named Dahurasuran. Immediately after intense penance, he acquired a boon that he could possibly be killed only by a woman. Parvati then took the shape of Kali to slay him. Soon after satisfying her mission, her wrath took the form of a youngster. Kali fed her child together with her milk. Looking at all this, Shiva emerged there and manufactured both of those Kali and the child to merge into him. From this kind of Bhairava, Shiva appeared in all his 8 manifestations of Ashtanga Bhairavas.\nKalabhairava is one of the varieties of Lord Shiva, as per Hindu mythology. However, this avatar of Lord Shiva is intense and harmful. He is the one particular deity who keeps his devotees clear of materialistic items such as greed, lust, jealousy or lust.\nBecause of this, any individual with any religious affiliations and beliefs can still reap the benefits of their proficient means of Vedic Knowledge.\nकालभैरवाष्टकं पठंति ये मनोहरं ज्ञानमुक्तिसाधनं विचित्रपुण्यवर्धनम् । शोकमोहदैन्यलोभकोपतापनाशनं प्रयान्ति कालभैरवांघ्रिसन्निधिं नरा ध्रुवम् ॥९॥\nHe is the giver of wealth and prosperity.

In Shiva temples, in the event the temple is closed, the keys are positioned ahead of Bhairava.\nThere are actually fascinating legends with regard to the origin of Bhairava. Based on one of these, at the time, Lord Brahma, the God of creation way too was owning 5 heads, similar to Lord Shiva. He grew to become a bit arrogant on account of this attribute, commenced getting himself as equal to Shiva in all respects and commenced considering self as the ultimate source of all creations. Also holding himself as being the supreme Almighty, he begun anticipating Everybody else to worship him. Shiva recognized what was taking place and felt that it's time that Brahma is demonstrated his spot for The nice of the universe. It really is then that he then took the fierce kind of Bhairava and plucked out considered one of Brahma’s heads.\nWhen you are dealing with house disputes and various problems connected with getting residence, then the best option is to seek divine blessings of lord batuk bhairav.

    "text": "Kaspersky a dÃ©couvert un nouveau virus espion visant les smartphones Android. Le malware, baptisÃ© LunaSpy par les chercheurs russes, se fait passer pour un antivirus pour piÃ©ger les utilisateurs. Dans certains cas, le logiciel malveillant se prÃ©sente comme un ensemble Â« d’outils de protection bancaire Â».\nÂ« Par souci de sÃ©curitÃ©, beaucoup sont prÃªts Ã installer nâ€™importe quelle application promettant une protection fiable contre les malwares et les arnaques. Les crÃ©ateurs de nouveaux logiciels espions mobiles exploitent habilement cette peur Â», explique Kaspersky.\nActif depuis fÃ©vrier 2025, LunaSpy se propage par le biais de simples messages. En usurpant l’identitÃ© d’un de vos contacts, le pirate va vous recommander d’installer l’application d’un antivirus. Parfois, le message recommande d’installer une application par le biais d’une chaine Telegram populaire. Comme l’explique Kaspersky, Â« de nouvelles chaÃ®nes apparaissent dans Telegram chaque seconde, il est donc tout Ã fait possible que certaines d’entre elles distribuent des logiciels malveillants sous le couvert de logiciels lÃ©gitimes Â».\nÃ€ lire aussi :\n[Nouvelle attaque sur Android – le malware Konfeti est de retour, plus sournois que jamais]\nMots de passe, SMS, localisationâ€¦ le virus pille toutes les donnÃ©es du smartphone infectÃ©\nUne fois tÃ©lÃ©chargÃ© et installÃ©, l’application malveillante va singer le comportement d’un antivirus. L’app va effectuer une prÃ©tendue analyse de votre smartphone et dÃ©couvrira une foule de menaces encore non dÃ©tectÃ©es. La fausse Â« application de sÃ©curitÃ© affiche le nombre de menaces dÃ©tectÃ©es sur l’appareil afin de forcer l’utilisateur Ã fournir toutes les autorisations possibles Â», indique Kaspersky dans son rapport. En provoquant la panique de l’utilisateur, l’application va le convaincre de lui accorder une foule d’autorisations sur le tÃ©lÃ©phone.\nGrÃ¢ce Ã ces autorisations, LunaSpy va pouvoir se servir dans les donnÃ©es du smartphone. Le virus va voler des mots de passe sur votre navigateur web et sur votre messagerie, enregistrer de l’audio et des vidÃ©os Ã votre insu par le biais de la camÃ©ra et du micro, lire vos SMS, consulter vos contacts et votre historique d’appels, faire des captures d’Ã©cran et vous localiser en temps rÃ©el. Toutes Â« les informations collectÃ©es par le logiciel malveillant sont envoyÃ©es aux attaquants Â». Par ailleurs, le malware peut exÃ©cuter du code malveillant sur l’appareil, ce qui ouvre la porte Ã l’installation d’autres maliciels.\nPour ne pas tomber dans un piÃ¨ge, on vous recommande d’Ã©viter de tÃ©lÃ©charger des applications en dehors du Play Store, surtout si elles sont partagÃ©es par un message non sollicitÃ© ou par un canal Telegram. Avant d’accorder votre confiance Ã un antivirus, ou Ã une application, prenez le temps de faire quelques recherches. Enfin, mÃ©fiez des apps qui rÃ©clament une quantitÃ© monstrueuse de permissions au moment de l’installation.\nIl n’est malheureusement pas rare qu’un virus espion s’attaque aux smartphones Android. RÃ©cemment, des chercheurs ont dÃ©couvert des exactions perpÃ©trÃ©es par DCHSpy, un virus dÃ©ployÃ© par MuddyWater, un gang criminel parrainÃ© par lâ€™Ã‰tat iranien, dans le but de dÃ©rober des informations personnelles. Quelques mois plus tÃ´t, une menace analogue provenait de la CorÃ©e du Nord, sous la forme de KoSpy, un outil de surveillance planquÃ© dans le code de cinq applications Android en apparence inoffensives.\nðŸ”´ Pour ne manquer aucune actualitÃ© de 01net, suivez-nous sur\n[Google ActualitÃ©s]et\nSource :\nKaspersky",

    "title": "\"We're the Rocket, it's what we do\": Laval storms back to steal a win from the Penguins",
    "text": "While the Laval Rocket had lost on Saturday to the Cleveland Monsters, their strong start to 2025 continued as they had collected points in all four games played so far in the new year. Standing in their way next was the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, a team that pulled off a huge comeback win over the Rocket in December.\nThere were not many lineup changes to be made for Pascal Vincent, who swapped Sean Farrell into the lineup in place of Vincent Arseneau, whose tenacity was likely not needed against the Penguins on this night. William Trudeau and Logan Mailloux anchored the top pair, with Noel Hoefenmayer and Adam Engström right behind them. Cayden Primeau looked to improve to 3-0-0 on the year as he took the starting spot with Connor Hughes as the backup.\nLaval had the misfortune to start the game short-handed almost immediately, not due to penalties but due to Xavier Simoneau taking a puck square off the face, leaving him bloodied and headed back to the locker room. Even down a man, the Rocket were able to grind away opportunities against the Penguins, with Farrell and Lucas Condotta both just putting chances wide of goal in the opening minutes.\nIt remained an even contest as the first period ticked on, with both teams seemingly waiting for the other to blink first. Unfortunately for the Rocket, it was them making the first mistake and allowing the Penguins to open up the scoring at Place Bell. Engström mishandled a pass at the point, allowing the Pens to counter with an odd-man rush. Rutger McGroarty slid a pass to Avery Hayes, and Hayes tucked it neatly through the five-hole of Primeau to make it a 1-0 game.\nDan Renouf gave the Rocket a near immediate chance to get back into the game as he interfered with Laurent Dauphin and put the Rocket on a power play. Instead, the power-play woes continued to be an issue as Hoefenmayer was beaten to a puck by Jonathan Gruden on a short-handed rush, with Gruden then beating Primeau for another goal.\nLaval’s advantage wasn’t able to cut into the two-goal deficit, however the shifts that followed led by Filip Mešár nearly cut the Penguins’ lead in half. Filip Larsson continued to be a brick wall between the pipes. It was a first period to forget for the Rocket as they headed into the first intermission with a mountain to climb in the remaining 40 minutes.\nFor unknown reasons, the Penguins swapped their netminders to start the second period with Jaxon Castor replacing Larsson between the pipes. Castor was tested almost immediately as the Rocket tried to cut into deficit. Farrell banked a shot off Castor’s pads, then Mešár fired the rebound as Castor came across with an incredible glove save to take away a sure goal.\nThe physicality ramped up from there as Condotta and Renouf had a spirited fight, and then Florian Xhekaj laid out an opponent with a reverse hit, drawing an interference call. While the Rocket were short-handed, they pushed the Penguins over and over again with odd-man rushes, but they were denied by both the crossbar and their own inaccuracy.\nThe frustrations continued to boil for the Rocket as their offence stalled out time and time again, leaving the team mostly defending in their own end. When Sam Poulin got a bit too close to Primeau, Mailloux took that as an invitation to throw him to the ice, sending the Rocket back to the penalty kill. While the Rocket killed off Mailloux’s first penalty, his return to play didn’t last long as he had one too many cross-checks in a board battle and found himself back in the box.\nTheir issues were compounded 35 seconds into their penalty kill as Laurent Dauphin cross-checked Ville Koivunen as he entered the zone, giving the Penguins a two-man advantage late in the first period. While Primeau wasn’t at his best in the first period, he was absolutely dialed in during the penalty kill, denying the Penguins multiple times and allowing the Rocket to escape their lack of discipline unscathed.\nDesperately needing a spark, the Rocket’s top line went to work as the period wound down, testing Castor repeatedly, but still unable to bury one of the rebound chances in front of them.\nAs the final seconds ticked down, the Pens handed Laval a huge opportunity as Renouf took a seat for hooking giving them a power play to start the third period.\nIn the opening stages, the Rocket were struggling to find their rhythm as the reworked power-play units took the ice, but the continued efforts of the Penguins kept them off the board. The quick feet of Dauphin drew another call however, giving the Rocket a crucial two-man advantage inside the first two minutes of the period. The power play continued to struggle mightily even with two extra attackers, and the Penguins managed to escape it with just four total shots having reached Castor.\nThings got worse from there as a puck hit off Mailloux at the point, turning into another breakaway chance for the Penguins. Engström tried to swipe the puck away but Emil Bemstrom was too strong and buried his 16th goal of the year past Primeau to make it a 3-0 game.\nA failed brief power play left the Rocket running low on options for a potential comeback.\nThe young guns did their part with just under eight minutes left to play as Mešár sent Trudeau into the offensive zone with speed. Trudeau found some space down the wing and fired a shot that fooled Castor on his near post, finally getting the Rocket on the scoreboard.\nThe Rocket goal seemed to bring back the swagger the team was missing for most of the night, and the Penguins began to feel that pressure.\nA strong fourth-line shift dug further into the Penguin lead, and set up a thrilling finish at Place Bell. Jared Davidson won the race to a puck, giving Luke Tuch a chance to feed it around the boards to Xhekaj along the goal line. Xhekaj picked his spot well, firing one in over Castor’s shoulder and drawing the Rocket back within a goal.\nThe ball was already rolling downhill and it felt like it was a matter of time until the Rocket would strike once again. It was again the fourth line making their presence felt and winning the ugly battles to get find the game tying goal. Tuch found Trudeau alone in space and Trudeau waited while finding Gustav Lindström. The veteran defender hammered the one-timer through a wide open five-hole and suddenly the game was all tied up.\nWhen it rained, it poured on the Penguins as they capped off a disastrous run of play with Mac Hollowell high-sticking Simoneau and getting a double minor for his troubles. Laval came within inches of winning it in regulation, and earned one point by forcing the game to overtime. They would start the extra frame with 2:14 of power-play time left over.\nThe Rocket didn’t find the back of the net with their power play, but it was clear the finish wasn’t far off as the overtime period ticked on. A shot from Mailloux bounced in front of goal where Dauphin took a huge cross-check while trying to sweep it home. It would have been another Rocket power play … if Jared Davidson hadn’t jumped on the loose puck and buried it into the net to seal an impressive comeback win for Laval.\nFinal Score: Laval 4, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton 3 (OT)\nNow tied atop the North Division with 47 points, Laval plays its next game against the last-place Utica Comets on Friday.",

    "text": "O sindicato que representa os pilotos da Portugália decidiu renovar a greve a tempo parcial aos voos realizados para a TAP de 28 de Março a 11 de Abril, disse à Lusa fonte oficial do Sindicato Independente de Pilotos de Linhas Aéreas ( SIPLA ) .\nDepois da paralisação de 12 a 27 de Março, que contou com uma adesão, em média, de 95% \"ou superior\" em alguns dias, os associados decidiram avançar com novo pré-aviso de greve entre as 3h e as 9h de 28 de Março a 11 de Abril, adiantou o SIPLA.\nNesta faixa horária, a Portugália realiza 28 a 29 voos para a TAP, mas nestes dias \"foram realizados apenas um ou dois\", além da ligação obrigatória entre Lisboa e a Terceira, nos Açores.\nA mesma fonte oficial faz um balanço \"positivo\" e revela que têm decorrido várias reuniões com a administração da TAP, muitas por telefone. Porém, como consideram que \"continua a não haver garantias de estabilidade\", decidiram renovar a paralisação.\n\"Tem havido avanços em algumas matérias, mas quando enviam a redacção das propostas vêm alteradas\" face ao que foi falado nos encontros, e \"sem qualquer compromisso concreto que garantisse o futuro dos pilotos da Portugália\", segundo a mesma fonte.\n\"Em apenas um mês, a administração contradisse as próprias afirmações, provando que a única coisa que realmente mudou foi a sua estratégia de desinformação\", lamenta o sindicato.\nO SIPLA revelou ainda que lhes foi transmitido que a TAP iria reduzir a frota da Portugália de 19 para 17 aeronaves, e que não haveria garantias de trabalhadores serem integrados na companhia aérea de bandeira.\nApesar de recentemente a Portugália ter transitado da TAP SGPS para a TAP SA , no âmbito da reprivatização da companhia aérea, \"nada vai mudar\", lamentou o sindicato, acrescentando que \"temem pelo futuro da empresa\" que actualmente emprega quase 900 trabalhadores.\nO sindicato informa também que \"já avançou com a queixa junto da Autoridade da Concorrência portuguesa\" por violação das regras de concorrência no Regulamento do Recurso à Contratação Externa (RRCE), estando a preparar também uma manifestação junto da Direcção-Geral da Concorrência Europeia.\nUm dos motivos da insatisfação está precisamente relacionado com o RRCE, criado em 1998, que tinha como objectivo funcionar como um travão à contratação de voos externos pela TAP, incluindo à Portugália que representa a maior fatia, impondo limites que, caso sejam ultrapassados, revertem a favor dos pilotos da TAP através do pagamento de compensações indemnizatórias.\nEste protocolo, usado por várias companhias europeias, originou custos de 60 milhões de euros no ano passado, como resultado do pagamento de seis salários-base extraordinários a cada piloto da TAP, como o Expresso tinha noticiado em Maio de 2024.\nOs pilotos da Portugália, que em 2023 realizou cerca de 25% do total de voos da TAP de acordo com o relatório da TAP SGPS, têm vindo a criticar as consequências deste protocolo e defendem que só reforça que é \"considerada uma empresa externa\".\nA direcção do SIPLA enviou uma proposta à administração TAP que previa a \"substituição das aeronaves actuais, aquisição de novas aeronaves, garantias laborais, protecção na redução de postos de trabalho devido à diminuição de frota, definição de um número mínimo de aeronaves e a admissão de oficiais pilotos da Portugália na TAP por concurso interno\".\nEm respostas à Lusa, em 12 de Março, a TAP informou que \"na impossibilidade de um consenso que permita evitar um protesto cuja razão de ser é de difícil compreensão, a TAP tomou já todas as medidas possíveis para mitigar o efeito desta greve junto dos passageiros\".\nNesse sentido, assegura que a operação iria decorrer com normalidade neste período.",

    "title": "10 Signs Someone In Your Life Is Not A Good Person, According To Psychology",
    "text": "10 Signs Someone In Your Life Is Not A Good Person, According To Psychology\nRemove people from your life who bring misery.\nHaving good influences in your life is a true blessing, because when you inevitably need a shoulder to try on, having someone dependable to lean on is always welcome.\nBut what happens if the people around you aren’t such great influences? What happens when they're manipulative or toxic? How does that impact us? If you want to spot a not-so-great person in your life, there are a few red flags to consider.\nHere are 10 signs someone in your life isn't a good person\n1. They always think negatively\nEkateryna Zubal | Shutterstock\nYou might not see a little negativity in your life as such a big deal. After all, it’s inevitable. However, having a toxic or negative attitude isn’t a good thing.\nStudies have shown that self-criticism is associated with dangerous thoughts, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and pain response. And that’s just for self-criticism. Another interesting study found that people who talked to supportive friends, compared to friends they felt ambivalent about, had lower blood pressure.\nIt’s clear that negative talk doesn’t even just affect us mentally, but physically as well. And having someone around you\nwith negative thought patterns is a surefire way to bring you down, too.\n2. They have no empathy\nAndrea Piacquadio | Pexels\nIf someone in your life has no empathy for you, your struggles, or even people they don’t know, it’s best to cut ties. Empathy is a basic emotion that most people have, whether it’s in their relationships, family, or even with co-workers. Without empathy, you can’t truly connect.\nHowever, younger generations are less empathetic and more narcissistic,\naccording to one study. This is bad news, as it can interfere with your ability to form healthy, meaningful relationships down the road, leading to increased loneliness and mental health issues. Don’t let someone who has no empathy stick around in your life.\n3. They dismiss your feelings\nSHVETS production | Pexels\nThe worst feeling in the world is feeling unimportant.\nAs research says, “When people feel that their emotions are judged as unacceptable, wrong or inappropriate, they experience the world differently. Daily emotions are less positive, and stressors are more common and more intense during negative affective states.”\nThis is why having a person in your life who\nconstantly dismisses your feelings is a bad thing and exposes them as an unlikable person. Not only does it impact your daily mood, but it can cause you to feel more stressed, leading to worsening mental and physical health.\n4. They break their promises\nAugust de Richelieu | Pexels\nDon’t underestimate the importance of keeping a promise, as trust means everything in relationships. In fact,\naccording to one study, “findings support the development of trust in romantic partners as an approach to stability and avoidance of problems in romantic relationships.”\nHowever,\nwhen you break those promises, you directly destroy trust in your relationships, and not having trust in a relationship leads to instability and insecurity. So, if you have someone in your life who is breaking promises all the time, cut them out of your life. Likely, they’re no good and don’t respect you enough.\n5. They show no remorse\nfizkes | Shutterstock\nWhen you get into a heated argument with someone, you\nprobably apologize at some point, even if you’re correct. But when you let your pride get the better of you, it ruins your relationships with others. And if this is what not-so-good people in your life do, you can’t expect to have a lasting bond with them. A lack of remorse shows a lack of development on their part, but it also emotionally drains you. It puts the weight of the relationship solely on your shoulders and your shoulders, meaning that if you don’t apologize, your relationship continues to stay strained. As you can imagine, this leads to a terrible mentality and a load of stress.\n6. They play the victim\nKarolina Kaboompics | Pexels\nIf you have someone in your life\nwho constantly plays the victim, it’s not a good sign. Playing the victim and never taking accountability for your actions is a glaring red flag. Understandably, it’s human nature to avoid feelings of guilt or shame. Truthfully, nobody wants to take accountability because it’s easier (and feels better) to play the victim. According to research, “People are more likely to delegate choices for others than choices for themselves, especially choices with potentially negative consequences, stemming from a desire to avoid feeling responsible or being blamed for such decisions.” However, making the active choice to never take responsibility and always play the victim shows a person’s toxicity and reveals how manipulative they truly are.\nRegardless of how much we don’t enjoy accountability, we choose to take it if it means saving our relationships. And if a person in your life actively chooses not to, it’s best to let them go. As\npsychotherapist Erin Leonard writes, “A person who plays the victim actively manipulates others by attention-seeking, inflicting guilt, and evading accountability.” And that doesn’t make for a positive environment.\n7. They criticize others\nPeopleImages.com - Yuri A | Shutterstock\nWhen you’re happy within yourself, you’ll never feel the need to critique others.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126102/ that happier people “achieve better life outcomes, including financial success, supportive relationships, mental health, effective coping, and even physical health and longevity.”\nAnd when all these positive outcomes are happening, you likely don’t feel the need to put others down. So, if you have a\nperson in your life who frequently criticizes others, it’s best to distance yourself from them. After all, you don’t want to ruin your chances of a happy and successful life just because of one miserable individual.\n8. They belittle your achievements\npixelheadphoto digitalskillet | Shutterstock\nAnyone who belittles your achievements is not someone you want around you. Because\nwhen you’re in a truly healthy relationship or friendship and are content with yourself, there will never be a need to demean other people.\nYou love that other person and want to see them succeed, but if you do feel the need to demean people, this is classical projecting. When we hate ourselves for specific characteristics, we unconsciously assign those characteristics to other people. And research supports this, with\none study finding that people who believe they’re high in anger perceive other people’s behavior as angry.\n9. They're manipulative\nDimaBerlin | Shutterstock\nIt should be obvious that people who are manipulative are simply no good. However, spotting manipulation is easier said than done. For instance, forms of manipulation like gaslighting aren't always so easy to detect.\nProfessor of sociology\nDeborah J. Cohan writes, “People who are manipulative or emotionally abusive are often attractive and charming at first.” But if they're giving you the silent treatment after an argument, withholding care and attention, making threats about your relationship constantly, or using your own insecurities against you, this person is incredibly manipulative and doesn’t deserve to be in your life.\n10. They never compromise\nDimaBerlin | Shutterstock\nIn any good relationship,\nthere's a need to compromise. But if a person in your life refuses to do so, it most likely means they’re not good for you. Behavioral cognitive therapist Bernard Golden adds, “Compromise is a major strategy for conflict resolution and is essential for any working relationship — whether in our personal lives, the workplace, in our communities or as citizens.”\nWhen someone in your life refuses to compromise, they want all the benefits of the relationship without sacrificing anything in return.\nThis inequality can lead to misery, so it’s important to nip it in the bud before it goes too far. After all, you deserve to be happy, and if it means removing a toxic person from your life, so be it.\nMarielisa Reyes is a writer with a bachelor's in psychology who covers self-help, relationships, career, family, and astrology topics.",

    "title": "Congressional candidate campaigns on her abortion story",
    "text": "(The Center Square) – Michigan congressional candidate Emily Busch is taking an unorthodox approach in her most recent campaign ad. In a spot released earlier this week, Busch talks about her experience getting an abortion her freshman year of college, and how other young women today do not have the same option she did more than 30 years ago. “At the end of the day, I had a choice. But across this country, too many women don't have that choice,” Busch [says in her video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpvgPg7LKFI). “We are somehow going backwards. Nineteen-year-old girls have less rights than I did 33 years ago.” Busch is not the first in politics to share such a personal story. Southern state representatives Marilyn Lands, D-Ala., and Gloria Johnson, D-Tenn., both recalled their medically necessary terminations back in 2022. Candidate for the Tennessee state House Allie Phillips also has campaigned on her medical-related abortion. Eva Burch, an Arizona state senator, announced on the legislative floor that she would be having an abortion, while U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., has mentioned her termination due to sexual assault. Even Amy Brown, the wife of a Nevada Republican running for Senate, said she had an abortion earlier in life. The Democratic candidate uses her experience to counter incumbent Congressman John James, R-Shelby Township. Busch says in the ad that James is against all forms of abortion, with no exceptions. However, in the last year, James did confirm there should be special considerations for rape, incest and when the mother’s life is put on the line. In a ballot measure last year, Michigan guaranteed the right to abortion in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. While this guarantees some form of access to abortion, it does not guarantee against certain restrictions. Busch also attacks Democratic frontrunner Carl Marlinga, a former Macomb County judge, for his Catholic anti-abortion stance. However, in recent years he has also affirmed the decision is a private one. Busch, Marlinga, financial planner Diane Young and state Board of Education member Tiffany Tilley are all competing for the Democratic nomination to face incumbent John James this November.",

    "title": "Birmingham bin strike talks resume amid claims council progress is 'sluggish' | ITV News Central",
    "text": "Fresh talks are to be held today in a bid to resolve a long-running pay dispute between bin collectors and Birmingham City Council . It comes after weeks of strikes have led to rubbish piling up on the streets, with residents complaining of rats.The union has claimed any chance of a breakthrough was being “hobbled” by commissioners who were drafted in to help with the council’s finances.Negotiations between Unite and the council took place last week without any sign of progress.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"The council’s public statements about wanting to end this dispute are directly at odds with its sluggish approach to negotiations.\"The lack of clear answers during talks, and the long periods between meetings make it seem like the council can’t call its own shots.\"Are the council’s decision-making abilities being hobbled by unelected commissioners?\"If that’s the case, the council needs to be honest with its workers and the public and tell them exactly what decisions it can and cannot make without the commissioners’ permission.\"Unite said the commissioners, who were brought in by the previous government, were overseeing 'massively damaging budget' reductions across the city.Unite regional officer Zoe Mayou said: \"Unite stands ready to enter intensive negotiations with the council, including with the conciliation service Acas. But this dispute will not end unless the hugely damaging cuts to refuse workers’ wages are reversed.\"Cllr Majid Mahmood from Birmingham City Council said the authority was willing to work around the clock to resolve the dispute, having already made a “fair and reasonable” offer to affected workers.He said: \"I was brought into this role by the leader to transform a service that hasn’t been meeting the expectations of residents. I am determined now more than ever to ensure that we transform and modernise the service.\"I share the frustration of residents, I understand they’re fed up. I’m a born and bred Brummie. I have not had a collection for a fortnight myself but we have put contingencies in place to try to support residents during this industrial action.\"We’ve extended the hours of the household recycling centres so they can book a slot online and attend the centre to dispose of waste.'The cabinet member added: \"My message is to Unite – please work with us. We’re willing to work around the clock to resolve this.\"Working with Unite we can collectively bring about the best service to the people and communities – a service that the people of this city deserve, a service that we can all be proud of, and a service that could be the envy of other councils.\"A spokesperson for the conciliation service Acas said: \"Acas has a long history of resolving disputes. Our expert conciliators have significant experience in helping parties come to an agreement and our services are available to any parties in dispute.\"Subscribe free to our weekly newsletter for exclusive and original coverage from ITV News.
