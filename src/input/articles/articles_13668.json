    "title": "4 Ways the Church Is a Beacon of Hope When Disaster Strikes",
    "text": "Tragedy struck Texas last week as flash flooding struck the central part of the state, including a Christian summer camp, known as Camp Mystic.\nSuch a tragedy is devastating, as the floods have taken the lives of over 100 people, including 15 children. Additionally, the flood took the lives of 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic.\nIn the aftermath of this disaster, we must ask, How can the Church be a beacon of hope and aid in the midst of such overwhelming loss? That being said, I would like to provide several points in which the Body of Christ can attend to the tragedy at this time.\n1. Prayer and Comfort\nIn the Scriptures, the Bible says, “grieve with those who grieve” (Romans 12:15). We must pray for the families of those who have died in the flash flooding. If possible, reach out to those grieving if you live in the area. It is easy to ponder why this tragedy could have happened.\nAs Christians, we recognize that we live in a fallen world in which suffering is both present and inevitable. I cannot imagine the pain for the parents of a child who has died in the flood or for a child who has lost a parent. We must pray for them fervently at this time that God the Father would comfort them for “He is close to the brokenhearted” and rescue those who are “crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:8). Lord knows the pain we’ve been through ourselves, including losing a loved one, so let us comfort them in their pain. Time and time again, we’ve come to realize that God comforts us in our pain because He Himself is our comfort. As the apostle Paul told the church in Corinth, 2 Corinthians 1:3–4, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.”\nBecause God is our comfort, we can comfort others with the comfort God has given us. Much comfort is needed following last week’s flash flood, and what better comfort than what our Lord provides. Although comfort is a means, it is not the goal. It is meant to provide hope for the downtrodden that God is still in the midst of the tragedy. As the church, we must pray that those impacted by the floods would either turn to God for salvation or be re-oriented to God if they are already saved.\n2. Love And Service\nThe church must also be of service to all. We must be ready and willing to help out those in need. There’s no doubt that the floods have left destruction in their wake, including destroyed homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Although it is commendable to have Christian and non-Christian humanitarian organizations providing relief efforts, how much more for the churches both locally and abroad! Let us serve beyond the four walls without hesitation. Let our talk be reflected in our walk, for our faith is evidenced by action. We love others out of love for God; thus, we must serve others out of service to God. Jesus talks about the importance of serving those in need in Matthew 25: 31-26, where He discusses that we are to be feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, caring for the sick, or visiting those in prison as if we are doing it for Him.\nThis also goes to show that the Lord deeply cares for us, for we are made in His image. Moreover, in Christ, we realize that God has loved us with an everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3). So let us then, attend to those in need of food, supplies, shelter, and more right now in the Lone Star state— whether it’s through raising funds or purchasing these things themselves. We do it out of love. I mean, don’t we desire the same when we’re suffering?\n3. Preaching the Gospel\nThe best encouragement that the church can provide is through sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is not a suggestion; this is a non-negotiable for the church. As famously said by our Savior, He tells His disciples in Matthew 28:18-20: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”\nChrist, who has all authority, commissions His disciples to make disciples all around the world. And how do we do that? Through sharing the Gospel. What is the Gospel? The apostle Paul makes this clear: “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.” (Romans 1:16). Although the tragedies of this world leave people feeling in despair, they are not without hope. Just as we came to understand that “while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8), so we can share this glorious truth with the world, both locally and abroad. The Gospel is not limited to time zones or nations; it is meant to be shared all over the world. We know that God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for us, bore the wrath of God that was meant for us, and now makes us righteous before God through Christ’s very own righteousness. Now that is good news, as Christ’s righteousness is perfect, for He is perfect, as He lived a perfect life without sin. Additionally, He gives us His Holy Spirit, who “bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, (Romans 8:18).\nTherefore, we must spread this Gospel throughout the world, particularly right now in those in the Lone Star State. As time goes on, let us realize the importance of sharing the Good News, as each day is a day closer to the return of Jesus Christ. To close, let us consider these words from our Savior, which we can apply, “Then he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest'” (Matthew 9:37-38). Therefore, let us carry out the commission we were given in sharing the Gospel.\n4. Prayer\nHeavenly Father,\nI pray continually for the people who have lost a loved one from the floods in Texas. We pray that your church would be responsive in offering their prayers and comfort, their love through service, and through the preaching of the Gospel. Lord, in this day and age, Your church must preach The Good News now more than ever. Emboldened us to be a light to the world and a beacon of hope to the lost, for we know that salvation belongs to the Lord.\nIn Jesus’ name.\nAmen.\nPhoto Credit: ©GettyImages/EricVryn/Stringer\nMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer and content creator.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Facebook, desinformación y elecciones: un cóctel peligroso para la democracia En 2016, en Birmania, un algoritmo amplificó el odio. En 2025, podría suceder algo similar. La reciente decisión de Mark Zuckerberg, presidente de Meta, de eliminar la verificación de contenidos en Facebook e Instagram, pone a millones de usuarios en riesgo de enfrentar un tsunami de desinformación, justo cuando la democracia global se tambalea.\nBirmania y los algoritmos: el poder de la manipulación En su libro Nexus , Yuval Noah Harari relata cómo los algoritmos de Facebook exacerbaron la violencia en Birmania. Entre 7,000 y 25,000 rohinyás murieron durante la limpieza étnica ejecutada por el Ejército y extremistas budistas. Facebook, en su momento, admitió que no hizo lo suficiente para evitar la propagación del odio.\nLos algoritmos priorizaron mensajes incendiarios que generaban mayor interacción, sin medir el impacto devastador que tendrían en la realidad. Este antecedente histórico pone en perspectiva el peligro que representa dejar la moderación de contenidos exclusivamente en manos de los usuarios.\nLa decisión de Meta: el inicio de un caos informativo Zuckerberg anunció que Meta dejará de trabajar con terceros para verificar contenido en Facebook e Instagram. Según el empresario, esta práctica rozaba la censura. Sin embargo, la medida deja a millones de usuarios expuestos a un torrente de noticias falsas, propaganda y discursos de odio, especialmente en momentos críticos como las elecciones.\nImpacto en México:\n55% de los mexicanos se informa a través de redes sociales. Facebook es la principal plataforma de noticias con un 46% del electorado. Redes sociales y democracia en México: un matrimonio complicado El estudio CNEP México 2024, dirigido por Alejandro Moreno, revela que las redes sociales son el principal medio de información para los electores. Plataformas como Facebook, YouTube y TikTok dominan el panorama informativo, pero su capacidad de amplificar contenido falso o tendencioso amenaza la calidad de la conversación pública.\nDatos clave:\n46% de los electores mexicanos usaron Facebook para informarse durante campañas. 30% recurrió a YouTube. 26% confió en TikTok, donde predominan los formatos breves y emocionales. El riesgo de un tsunami de desinformación Sin verificación de contenido, Facebook podría convertirse en un canal perfecto para la propaganda y la desinformación, afectando especialmente a las democracias emergentes. Con elecciones en puerta, México podría enfrentar una oleada de mentiras que influyan en los resultados, fomenten divisiones y dificulten la toma de decisiones informadas.\nPreguntas urgentes:\n¿Cómo afectará esto al voto joven, especialmente dependiente de redes sociales? ¿Qué rol jugarán los algoritmos en amplificar narrativas de odio o desinformación? Harari y la advertencia sobre inteligencia artificial En Nexus , Harari argumenta que la inteligencia artificial debe ser vigilada y regulada. Sin embargo, el problema comienza con las decisiones humanas, como la de Zuckerberg, que priorizan el lucro sobre la calidad de la información.\nLa IA no es el principal riesgo: el verdadero peligro está en los humanos que controlan estas tecnologías, dejando que la manipulación y el odio encuentren terreno fértil en plataformas globales.\nEl desafío para la democracia La decisión de Zuckerberg deja a las democracias en una posición vulnerable. Sin mecanismos efectivos de verificación, las redes sociales podrían transformarse en herramientas de desinformación masiva, afectando elecciones y debilitando instituciones.\nPara México, donde la mitad del electorado depende de estas plataformas para informarse, el reto es monumental. Reforzar la educación digital y fomentar la capacidad crítica de los usuarios es urgente para enfrentar la nueva era de manipulación informativa.\n¡Únete a nuestro canal de Telegram!
