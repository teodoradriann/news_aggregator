    "text": "We, the consumers of news, are losing faith in journalism. Sensationalism, partisan bias, and corporate interests have left many of us questioning the credibility of the information we receive. The rise of clickbait and the blurring of lines between news and opinion have only deepened our mistrust. In a time when facts and truth are more critical than ever, we demand journalism that fulfills its highest purpose: to inform the public, empower citizens, and safeguard democracy. 1. To Inform and Educate: Journalism’s primary role is to provide factual, verified information that helps citizens understand the events that shape their lives. Whether it’s the economy, public health, social justice, or climate change, we need clear, accurate reporting to navigate the complexities of modern life. 2. To Safeguard Democracy: A healthy democracy depends on a well-informed electorate. Journalism empowers voters to make choices based on truth rather than propaganda or misinformation. Without reliable reporting, our democratic processes wither, and corruption thrives unchecked. 3. To Hold Power Accountable: Journalism serves as a watchdog, exposing abuses of power, corruption, and injustice. It keeps the powerful—whether in government, business, or other institutions—in check by ensuring transparency and accountability. Journalism must therefore be courageous, willing to anger the powerful and risk its own standing in the pursuit of truth. The duty to hold those in power accountable transcends any individual interest. 1. News organizations must prioritize information that impacts democracy, public health, and the general well-being of the nation and the world. Investigative reporting that exposes threats to these values must be given prominence over sensationalism and distraction. 2. We demand news that is rooted in fact, free of bias or editorialization. Journalism must distinguish clearly between reporting and opinion, and avoid favoring any political party, candidate, or agenda. The truth, not partisanship, should be the guiding principle. 3. Elevate stories that affect our lives, whether local or global. Avoid the temptations that distract from informing the public about critical issues—clickbait, lazy bothsiderism, or making elections about the horserace rather than the issues or the demonstrable character of the candidates. 4. We demand that journalism be walled off from the personal or business interests of the owners. The integrity of reporting should never be compromised by financial gain, corporate interests, or the political agendas of media proprietors. Journalism must serve the public, not the pockets of the powerful. 5. When mistakes happen, as they inevitably will, we demand swift corrections, retractions, and apologies. Accountability builds trust, and trust is the foundation of any meaningful relationship between journalists and the public. We, the consumers, need journalism that respects our intelligence and our role in a functioning democracy. We expect journalists to deliver truth without bias, to elevate stories of substance, and to act with integrity and transparency. In return, we will support journalism that holds power accountable, informs our decisions, and contributes to the health of our democracy. . Co-signed:",

    "text": "A network of scientists across the globe have identified more than 700 plant genera named for women. This is a nearly twenty-fold increase in the number of genera linked to women before the group started working on the list. The project, which aimed to highlight the contribution of women to botany, was the result of social media conversations about plants named for people. What began as a simple question about how many and which plant genera were named for women evolved into a global network of scientists who built a dataset of plant genera named in honor of women. The group, which met virtually for over two years, also worked to improve data easily available about these genera that have information publicly available through the global resource Wikidata. The results, which included a dataset of 728 plant genera named for women and female beings (mythological), were recently published in a paper entitled, \" [Creating a multi-linked ](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/114408/)dynamic dataset: a case study of plant genera named for women.\" \"Our motivation for this research was not only to highlight the names of plant genera named after women, but to look at the roles and lives of these women, many with fascinating stories, and to better recognize the contribution to science of this historically marginalized group,\" said Missouri Botanical Garden Curator Dr. Carmen Ulloa. Ulloa is one of eight co-authors of the paper that represents a multidisciplinary group of female experts from around the world with an interest in diversity and inclusion in science. Other authors involved in this research are from the Natural History Museum, London, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, the Cambridge University Herbarium, and from Wellington, New Zealand. Historically, women were often excluded from scientific professions, the paper explains, and one way that is plainly visible is in eponymy, or the practice of naming taxa for people. Like streets, monuments, and parks, plant names at all levels – species, genus, family, etc. – can be named for people. The group specifically focused on the names of flowering plant genera, as there are roughly 16,000 known genera compared to 450,000 known plant species. The group deliberately did not compare the number of names honoring women to those named for men with the intention of amplifying women's contributions to the history and development of science. Their research found that many of the contributions of women honored were in unpaid roles, such as a supportive spouse, or obscured among a collection team and \"whose role in the discovery of a new plant genus has been historically overlooked,\" explained Ulloa. It also created a dataset that can be used by other researchers looking to build upon the work. The team deliberately used a push-pull method so that existing resources were constantly updated in an Open Science approach as work proceeded. \"Taking this Open Science approach has ensured we have amplified the contribution of women to the field of botany,\" the paper explains. \"We hope to inspire others to use our methods and workflows to empower their own research and follow-up studies on under-represented and under-acknowledged groups in science.\" [here](/scientific-network-spotlights-plant-genera-1152190/).",

    "text": "Mañana una DANA dejará tormentas fuertes con vendavales y granizo grande en estas zonas de España En unas horas una pequeña DANA se adentrará en la Península, dejando a su paso tormentas que descargarán aguaceros intensos en varias regiones. Además, se prevén otros fenómenos adversos. En estas últimas horas una masa de aire cálido asociada a una dorsal subtropical ha provocado un ascenso generalizado de las temperaturas en [España](https://www.tiempo.com/), que tocarán techo en la jornada de hoy. Se prevén valores máximos que rondarán los 30 ºC en bastantes zonas de la mitad sur, valle del Ebro y en algunos sectores del archipiélago canario. Por suerte, como ya hemos ido explicando estos últimos días en Meteored, esta situación tiene las horas contadas. Con un chorro polar muy ondulado, situación bastante habitual en primavera, los centros de acción se muestran muy móviles, dando lugar a un tiempo muy variable. Y es lo que va a pasar en las próximas horas, como ya apunta desde hace días [nuestro modelo](https://www.tiempo.com/modelos/) de referencia. Mañana irrumpirá la DANA por el noroeste: habrá fuertes aguaceros en varias regiones En la tarde de este viernes ya tendremos algunas novedades en forma de chubascos aislados en el interior de [Galicia](https://www.tiempo.com/galicia.htm), Cordillera Cantábrica y en el Pirineo. No obstante, los cambios importantes llegarán sobre todo mañana de la mano de una pequeña y efímera DANA que cruzará el norte peninsular, siendo reabsorbida rápidamente por el chorro polar. Ya durante la primera mitad del sábado se formarán aguaceros localmente tormentosos que descargarán en el entorno del sector occidental de la Cordillera Cantábrica, [Castilla y León](https://www.tiempo.com/castilla-y-leon.htm), La Rioja e interior de Galicia. También se prevén chubascos más dispersos en las Penibéticas, Estrecho y en la cordillera pirenaica. En las horas centrales del día y por la tarde las tormentas irán ganando intensidad, trasladándose a otras zonas conforme el embolsamiento de aire frío vaya avanzando hacia el este. Los aguaceros serán localmente fuertes en la Cordillera Cantábrica, [País Vasco](https://www.tiempo.com/pais-vasco.htm), [Navarra](https://www.tiempo.com/comunidad-foral-de-navarra.htm), [La Rioja](https://www.tiempo.com/la-rioja.htm) e Ibérico Norte, pero también harán acto de presencia en buena parte de la Meseta Norte. También de forma más irregular y dispersa en el Pirineo y en zonas de montaña del sureste. Las tormentas dejarán bastante actividad eléctrica, granizo y fuertes rachas de viento La actividad eléctrica puede ser bastante importante en algunos sitios, y nuestro modelo de cabecera no descarta que algunos núcleos presenten un alto grado de organización. Se irán desplazando hacia el noreste, llegando al sur de Francia durante la tarde y tarde-noche, donde no se descarta la formación de algún sistema convectivo o líneas tormentosas. Sin embargo, estos aguaceros también dejarán fenómenos adversos en algunos sitios de la geografía española. Además de las precipitaciones que dejarán en su avance, localmente intensas, localmente irán acompañadas de granizo grande. Los mapas también muestran que probablemente se registrarán rachas de viento fuertes asociadas a las mismas, que puntualmente podrían pasar de los 70-80 km/h. A la espera de un cambio importante de tiempo a partir del domingo El domingo la DANA ya habrá sido reabsorbida por el chorro polar, con una onda no muy definida que cruzará el noreste peninsular. Aunque en un principio parecía que la inestabilidad iba a ser algo más generalizada, todo indica que al final la cosa se quedará en algunas tormentas dispersas en el Pirineo y en zonas de montaña del este, mientras que en Galicia y por la vertiente cantábrica habría lluvias asociadas a la aproximación de una borrasca. Las temperaturas bajarán en la mitad norte, pero en el resto no sufrirán grandes cambios e incluso pueden subir aún ligeramente en algunos sitios. En [Canarias](https://www.tiempo.com/canarias.htm) se quedarán al margen de esta situación. El cambio de tiempo será más importante la próxima semana por la aproximación de una borrasca fría y una irrupción de aire polar que provocará un descenso térmico notable y casi generalizado, con nevadas en zonas de montaña del norte.",
