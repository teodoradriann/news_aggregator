My love and adoration for him only grows.\" Video above: Emma Heming Willis 'not good' amid husband Bruce Willis' dementia battle The couple wed in 2009 and share two daughters together, Mabel and Evelyn. Heming also posted a vulnerable message to her [\"Die Hard\"](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/24/entertainment/peter-billingsley-die-hard-christmas/index.html) actor's [health issues](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/entertainment/bruce-willis-moonlighting-creator/index.html), sharing in the video that she \"was able to have a good cry\" with a close friend. \"It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and just kind of soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do,\" Heming said in the video. In February, Willis's family – including Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore and his daughters – [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html) that the actor has been diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or [FTD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737) for short. Heming, who has been open about her journey as Willis's primary caretaker on her social media ever since, said in her video this week that \"holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard.\" She added that \"building a community and connection\" has helped her get through it this year. \"That has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that,\" she said. Heming wrote in the caption to her Instagram video about receiving \"countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved,\" and that these messages help her feel \"less alone.\" \"I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much,\" she wrote. \"I am grateful to you.\"",

The company is actively pursuing partnerships, including one with Google’s long-time partner, to power specialised search features for various websites and apps, including those in the travel, food, real estate and retail sectors.Citing people who were briefed about the situation at OpenAI, a report by The Information says that the Microsoft-backed company has showcased prototypes and designs of these products to potential partners, including Condé Nast, Redfin, Eventbrite, and Priceline. These search features will leverage OpenAI's AI capabilities to provide more personalised and intuitive search experiences.OpenAI plans to power AI features in Samsung phonesFurthermore, OpenAI has reportedly engaged in discussions with Samsung to integrate its AI technology into the electronics giant’s devices. It is to be noted that OpenAI already supplies its AI technology to Apple.What makes this report interesting is that Samsung has already signed a long term partnership on AI and other areas that extend beyond Android. Rick Osterloh, SVP, platforms and devices at Google, shared a photo with TM Roh, president and head of MX Business, Samsung Electronics, on X.“Had a terrific conversation with TM and @SamsungMobile leadership.

    "text": "NEW YORK, June 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Teladoc Health Inc. (“Teladoc” or the “Company”) (NYSE: TDOC). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Teladoc and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 16, 2024, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired Teladoc securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com . [[Click here for information about joining the class action]]https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oTAGmAdACjvnFJ-3Ie53XofYMqXmnG86_5T78sHBAyJEubj-0ERzs-Wk_FTBca1lHIKSJyGCLRUSCzHiACZLpGsBXTS3r0nDTb_Ft6jEA0o7bPTZlloQvOchsiVcZ9am-8_33JSYcYcqwGEUvUtNyQv53f8fzjeCYBBPNQ06Fa_bHR9ROIp9f-MHovMCZNVN On February 20, 2024, Teladoc filed its annual report for 2023 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and held an earnings call to discuss the Company’s results. Among other items, Teladoc’s annual report disclosed substantially higher advertising costs, reporting advertising and marketing spend of approximately $668.854 million, compared to $623.536 million in 2022. Teladoc attributed the increase to “higher digital and media advertising costs related to BetterHelp”, the Company’s online mental health counseling platform and its largest division. Teladoc further disclosed that BetterHelp revenue fell by $1 million compared to the year prior and by $10 million between the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Teladoc also reported that BetterHelp lost members for two consecutive quarters, despite the Company’s increased advertising spend. On this news, Teladoc’s stock price fell $4.85 per share, or 23.67%, to close at $15.64 per share on February 21, 2024. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered billions of dollars in damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com . Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

    "text": "Watch more News on iWantTFC Filipino philanthropists closed out 2023 with a celebration for the non-profit group \"Jollybox.\"\nJollybox was founded by local photographer Madeline Arenas in 2020, and has regularly gathered donations for the Philippines and various causes.\nBut with the ongoing war in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas, Arenas has mobilized support for those affected by the conflict, including refugees in Los Angeles.\n\"We have displaced families in Israel that we’ve been helping,\" she said. \"A lot of them are a handful that needed our help. They’re starting from Israel to LA, so that’s what we’ve been doing with [other] nonprofit organizations as well.\"\nArenas is also helping Filipino civilians caught in the conflict.\n\"The Filipinos in Israel, they’ve been volunteering in farms and doing harvest on the stocks because all the workers left,\" she added. \"We’re going to create more awareness of what’s happening there and see if we can get more Filipinos to help those in need.\"\nThe Fil-Am philanthropist had planned to visit Israel but had to delay the trip as the conflict erupted.\nBut she said she plans to continue her journey there once the situation allows for it to bring much-needed supplies and her style of jolliness during a time of war.\n\"It’s overwhelming,\" said Arenas of Jollybox. \"Everyone who’s supported me through the years since Day 1, not only the sponsors, but also the volunteered are here. [They're] helping me, my family, and the generous donors. They really helped me a lot to push it through.\"\nIn LA, Arenas has also been at the forefront of local issues. She helps organize relief efforts for homeless Filipinos, those on their own, or those who are part of large encampments.\nBack home, she also believes more can still be done despite their progress.\n\"There’s so much to do in the Philippines,\" Arenas said. \"We have to get more awareness on the tribal communities. Those are the tribal [people] that need education, we’re building lives every year.\"",

    "text": "The Pokémon Company Takes Action Against Game Similar to Pokémon with Guns\nIn a surprising turn of events, The Pokémon Company has announced that it will be taking action against a game that has been making waves in the gaming community. The game in question, referred to as “Pokémon with guns,” has caught the attention of players and critics alike for its striking similarities to the beloved Pokémon franchise. The Pokémon Company has stated that it will not tolerate any infringement on its intellectual property rights and will take appropriate measures to address the issue.\nThe game causing all the commotion is Palworld, a surprise hit that has been steadily climbing up the Steam charts since its release in January 2024. With an impressive 8 million copies sold on Steam alone, Palworld has quickly become a force to be reckoned with in the gaming industry. Its developer, Pocketpair, recently released a roadmap outlining their plans for the future of the game, further solidifying its position as a major player in the market.\nHowever, with success comes scrutiny, and Palworld has not been immune to controversy. Many gamers have taken to social media to point out the striking similarities between Palworld’s creatures, known as “pals,” and the iconic Pokémon characters. Accusations of plagiarism have been thrown around, with some even claiming that Pocketpair directly stole Nintendo’s intellectual property. Pocketpair’s CEO, however, vehemently denies these allegations.\nThe Pokémon Company’s decision to take action against Palworld comes as no surprise to those familiar with Nintendo’s reputation for protecting its IP. The company has a long history of swiftly shutting down any unauthorized use of its characters and trademarks. In fact, they have already taken down a trailer for a mod created by YouTuber ToastedShoes, which replaced Palworld’s pals with actual Pokémon. ToastedShoes released a\nvideo detailing his experience with the mod, but it has since been removed.\nIn a statement posted on their website, The Pokémon Company addressed the issue at hand. They stated, “We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024. We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.”\nIt is clear that The Pokémon Company is committed to protecting its beloved franchise and ensuring that its intellectual property rights are upheld. They have reassured fans that they will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its\nworld, and work towards bringing the world together through Pokémon in the future.\nAs the battle between The Pokémon Company and Pocketpair unfolds, it remains to be seen what actions will be taken and how this controversy will ultimately be resolved. One thing is for certain, though – the gaming community will be watching closely to see how this clash of titans plays out.",

    "title": "Mitsubishi's L100 EV: Driving Indonesia Towards Sustainable Urban Mobility",
    "text": "On a bustling morning in Jakarta, a quiet revolution rolls onto the streets, heralding a new chapter in urban mobility for Indonesia. Mitsubishi, a name synonymous with automotive innovation, has unveiled its latest electric marvel - the Minicab-MiEV, now known as the L100 EV. Priced at Rp 320 million ($20,400) during its launch period, this compact kei-car signals Mitsubishi's bold strides into electric vehicle (EV) territory, promising an eco-friendly solution to the archipelago's transportation needs. Assembled with precision at Mitsubishi's Cikarang plant in West Java, this vehicle is not just a testament to technological advancement but a beacon of hope for a greener future.\nA Leap Towards Sustainable Urban Transport\nIndonesia's streets, often congested and choked with pollution, stand on the cusp of transformation with the introduction of the L100 EV. Equipped with a 10 kWh lithium-ion battery, the Minicab-MiEV offers a commendable range of 100 km on a single charge, making it an ideal choice for the city's bustling lanes and narrow alleyways. But the true game-changer lies in its bigger sibling – the L100 EV, boasting a range of up to 180 km, a significant improvement from its predecessors. This leap in efficiency is not just about numbers; it's a reflection of Mitsubishi's commitment to reducing carbon footprints and enhancing urban mobility in one of Southeast Asia's largest markets.\nPartnerships and Government Support: Fueling the Drive for EV Adoption\nThe journey of the L100 EV from concept to concrete reality has been paved with strategic partnerships and government incentives. Mitsubishi has not ventured alone; it has joined forces with giants like Pos Indonesia, Gojek, DHL Supply Chain, and Be Sanur for extensive market testing. These collaborations are not merely trials but a testament to the vehicle's versatility and reliability in fulfilling diverse commercial needs. Further propelling this venture is the Indonesian government's backing, offering a 10% value-added tax waiver for locally manufactured electric vehicles that source at least 40% of their components domestically. This policy not only underscores the nation's commitment to sustainable development but also makes the L100 EV a financially attractive option for businesses and entrepreneurs alike.\nA Future Charged with Possibilities\nThe L100 EV is more than just a vehicle; it's a harbinger of change. With the ability to charge up to 80% in just 42 minutes, it promises minimal downtime and maximum efficiency. But the benefits extend beyond the technical. Mitsubishi claims significant operational cost savings, thanks to the EV's efficient energy consumption and low maintenance needs. This, coupled with its spacious cargo space, better traction, and improved acceleration, presents a compelling case for commercial enterprises to make the switch. It's not just about being eco-friendly; it's about embracing a smarter, more sustainable way of doing business in the heart of Indonesia.\nAs the sun sets on the horizon, casting long shadows over Jakarta's crowded streets, the Minicab-MiEV, now reborn as the L100 EV, continues its silent journey. This electric microvan, conceived in the halls of Mitsubishi Motors Krama Yudha Indonesia assembly facility in Bekasi, is more than just a mode of transport. It's a symbol of Mitsubishi's vision for the future - a future where electric mobility is within reach of every Indonesian, transforming the urban landscape one street at a time. With the support of government policies and strategic partnerships, Mitsubishi's electric dream for Indonesia is slowly but surely becoming a reality, driving the nation towards a cleaner, greener tomorrow.",
