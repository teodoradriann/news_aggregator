    "text": "Gran incendio forestal en Tarragona\nBombers: el incendio del Baix Ebre \"evoluciona favorablemente\"\nDetectan dos fumarolas pero en zonas controladas. Los efectivos sobre el terreno se centran en el flanco izquierdo. El derecho está “muy bien trabajado”.\nLos Bombers de la Generalitat valorarán este jueves por la tarde si pueden dar por controlado el incendio de Paüls, aunque han asegurado que \"evoluciona favorablemente\". Así lo ha explicado la jefa de intervención, Mar Gil, quien ha indicado que continúan revisando el perímetro y que han aparecido algunas fumarolas, pero “en zonas controladas”.\nLos efectivos sobre el terreno se centran especialmente en el flanco izquierdo, mientras que el derecho está “muy bien trabajado”. Es precisamente en ese flanco izquierdo donde habrían aparecido las fumarolas, pero Gil ha insistido en que no deben generar alarma. De hecho, si la evolución se mantiene así, con unas condiciones meteorológicas también favorables, los Bombers se plantean comenzar a retirar vehículos a partir de esta tarde.\nDe momento, se mantienen 46 dotaciones terrestres —el mismo dispositivo que ha trabajado durante la noche— y tres medios aéreos: dos helicópteros bombarderos y uno de coordinación. Estos helicópteros están actuando sobre las zonas de difícil acceso donde se han detectado las nuevas fumarolas, junto con equipos manuales.\nEstas zonas son distintas de las que hasta ahora presentaban más inestabilidad, y se sitúan en la pared rocosa de Paüls y en la cabeza del flanco izquierdo, según ha detallado Gil.\nEn cuanto a la meteorología, ha señalado que la previsión es favorable, aunque se espera que entre marinada (brisa marítima) con rachas de hasta 15 kilómetros por hora por la tarde. “Pero no supone un viento que obligue a estar en alerta”, ha afirmado.\nEn líneas generales, la jefa de intervención ha asegurado que el perímetro está “bien cerrado” y que la evolución es positiva.\nRespecto a la investigación del origen del fuego, ha indicado que aún no hay ninguna hipótesis clara y ha explicado que, una vez la situación esté más tranquila, se realizarán vuelos de reconocimiento para analizar posibles caídas de rayos.\nEn este sentido, los Agentes Rurales y los Mossos d’Esquadra han creado un equipo conjunto que está investigando las causas del incendio.",

    "title": "Inside The Doomed Terra Nova Expedition To Antarctica",
    "text": "The doomed Terra Nova Expedition led to the torturous deaths of British Captain Robert Falcon Scott and four of his crew members — after they failed to become the first explorers to reach the South Pole. Wikimedia Commons Edward Adrian Wilson, Robert Falcon Scott, Lawrence Oates, Henry Robertson Bowers, and Edgar Evans at the South Pole.\nThe Terra Nova Expedition is widely regarded as one of the most significant polar odysseys in history — and one of the most tragic.\nIn 1910, a British crew set off aboard the S.S. Terra Nova to Antarctica . For Captain Robert Falcon Scott, their objective was two-fold: to gather valuable scientific data, and to be the first people to reach the South Pole.\nUnfortunately for them, another expedition crew led by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen would get there first. And the five Terra Nova crew members sent to the South Pole would tragically perish on the long trek back — including Scott himself.\nBut the mission wasn’t a complete loss. Before the polar crew died, the Terra Nova Expedition yielded hundreds of unprecedented discoveries that would forever change our understanding of the icy continent.\nTrip Leader Robert Falcon Scott Robert Falcon Scott was born June 6, 1868, in Devonport, England. He was the third of six children and had seafaring in his blood, as Scott’s grandfather and four uncles had all served in the British Royal Navy or Army.\nScott was sent to the Stubbington House school as a young boy to prepare for a Naval career of his own. He passed his entrance exams and boarded the HMS Britannia in 1881 at the age of just 13.\nA shy but steady and courageous young man, Scott spent the next two decades rising in the ranks on numerous Navy expeditions around the world — from midshipman in 1883 to lieutenant in 1897.\nWikimedia Commons Scott and his men at the South Pole.\nScott was around 31 when he bumped into his former colleague Clements Markham — the president of Britain’s Royal Geographical Society — in the streets of London. Years earlier, Markham had noted Scott’s intelligence and vigor for exploration, and he informed Scott of an impending expedition to Antarctica. Scott immediately applied to lead it.\nIn June 1900, despite having no exploration or polar travel experience, Scott was appointed the rank of commander and selected to lead the British National Antarctic, or Discovery , Expedition.\nScott proved his mettle. During the 1901 expedition to Antarctica, he achieved the new record for the farthest point reached south of the equator and performed the first thorough exploration of the frozen continent, making major finds in biology, zoology, magnetism, and meteorology.\nUpon his return to England in 1904, he was promoted to captain. But his mind was still on the Antarctic. He had nearly reached the South Pole during the British National Antarctic Expedition, and was determined to try once more.\nHe would get that chance in 1910 — as captain of the Terra Nova Expedition.\nThe Terra Nova Expedition Begins The Terra Nova departed June 15, 1910 from Cardiff, with dozens of crew members appointed by Robert Falcon Scott. Chief among them were head scientist Edward Wilson and photographer Herbert Ponting.\nThe Terra Nova Expedition’s official objective was to gather scientific and geographical data. However, the real prize, at least as far as the British imagination was concerned, was in reaching the South Pole before any other nation.\nThe competition was a fierce one. Earnest Shackleton had recently made it 97 miles from the South Pole during his 1907-1909 expedition. Roald Amundsen, meanwhile, was departing within days of Scott on his own Antarctic expedition, spurring a race against time for the pole.\nWikimedia Commons A grotto photographed by Herbert Ponting.\nAccording to the Antarctic Heritage Trust , the Terra Nova ‘s cargo included: 162 carcasses of mutton and three carcasses of beef; cheese and butter; three motor tractors and drums of petrol; two Siberian and 17 Manchurian ponies; 33 Siberian dogs; photo and medical supplies; as well as clothing, tools, sledging equipment, surveying instruments, coal, sleeping bags, tents, and huts.\nIn November 1910, according to a timeline from the Scott 100 Plymouth program, the crew lost two ponies, one dog, one sledge, and some coal and petrol in a storm before the ship even reached Antarctica.\nLife At The Cape Evans Basecamp The Terra Nova expedition arrived in January 1911 at the Ross Ice Shelf, otherwise known as the Great Ice Barrier, south of New Zealand. The crew unloaded sled dogs, ponies, and motorized sledges, set up pre-constructed huts, and began their research.\nOnce they established camp, First Officer Victor Campbell sailed east to King Edward VII Land. On his way back, he found Amundsen’s ship docked in the nearby Bay of Whales. After a brief greeting, Campbell rushed back to camp to inform Captain Scott that their competition had arrived.\nDetermined to beat Amundsen to the South Pole, Scott ordered his men to begin placing supply depots along the planned path in preparation for the journey. According to Mashable , six of the eight ponies sent on these missions died in blizzards.\nAs the Antarctic winter began in April, the 25 crew members stationed on land were forced to hunker down in a 50-by-25-foot hut. They busied themselves with research and soccer matches while Scott continued planning for the final push to the pole.\nDuring this time, Wilson managed to retrieve three Emperor penguin eggs for future study, braving temperatures as low as -77 degrees Fahrenheit on the 60-mile trek to the rookery.\nWikimedia Commons Three recovered Emperor penguin eggs.\nThe Treacherous Journey To The South Pole Captain Robert Falcon Scott finalized his plans to reach the South Pole in the Arctic spring. On Oct. 24, 1911, he set out across the Great Ice Barrier with 16 men, motor sledges, dogs, and ponies. According to Scott’s plan, different members of the group would turn back after reaching specific checkpoints, ultimately leaving five men to finish the final trek to the pole.\nHowever, the sledges broke down just 50 miles into the journey. With only dogs and a few ponies at their disposal, the group reached the end of the Great Ice Barrier on Dec. 4. When they reached the final plateau before the pole on Dec. 20, Scott sent the dogs back to base camp.\nOn Jan. 3, 1912, Captain Scott selected four men to join him in the final push: Edward Wilson, Lawrence Oates, Lieutenant Henry Bowers, and Edgar Evans.\nThe polar crew finally arrived at the South Pole on Jan. 17 — to find Amundsen’s flag already planted there.\nThe Norwegian explorer had beaten them by 34 days.\n“The POLE. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected,” a dismayed Scott wrote in his diary. “Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority.”\nDefeated, the men turned around to make the deadly 900-mile journey back to base.\nThe Icy Deaths Of The Terra Nova Expedition Polar Crew The crew crossed the polar plateau without much trouble. But on Feb. 17, while making the difficult climb up Beardmore Glacier, Evans collapsed from severe frostbite and other injuries — and died.\nIn early March, the remaining polar crew members were relieved to reach one of their supply depots on the Great Ice Barrier, where a dog team was supposed to pick them up. It never did.\nMeanwhile, Oates had developed such severe frostbite and gangrene that he couldn’t hike more than a few miles a day. He lost the use of his hands by March 17. It was his 32nd birthday.\nAware that he was slowing the team down, he died by suicide, telling the crew, “I am just going outside, and I may be some time,” before leaving their tent and walking into the elements.\nScott, Bowers, and Wilson forged ahead but got caught in a blizzard in late March, just 11 miles away from a huge food and supplies depot. They tragically perished while waiting it out.\n“Every day we have been ready to start for our depot 11 miles away, but outside the door of the tent it remains a scene of whirling drift,” Scott wrote in his last diary entry on March 29. “I do not think we can hope for any better things now. We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more… For God’s sake look after our people.”\nWikimedia Commons The grave of Robert Falcon Scott, Henry Robertson Bowers, and Edward Adrian Wilson.\nMeanwhile, the surviving Terra Nova Expedition members back at camp were routinely trekking to supply depots in hopes of finding Scott and his men, but without success. They eventually organized a full-fledged search party on Oct. 29. Within two weeks, they found the frozen bodies of Scott, Wilson, and Bowers — and built a stone cairn over their corpses.\nThe party reportedly continued searching for Oates, but only found his sleeping bag. There is no record of what was done with Evans’ body.\nThe Legacy Of The Terra Nova Expedition England was devastated by the loss of the Terra Nova crew members. But while they didn’t succeed in becoming the first people to reach the South Pole, the Terra Nova Expedition was far from fruitless.\nThe expedition yielded priceless scientific finds, including an estimated 2,000 animal specimens — 400 of which had never been discovered before, according to the BBC .\nChief among these specimens were the three Emperor penguin eggs Wilson had retrieved. Until that point, it was thought that these birds were descended from dinosaurs, a theory that an analysis of the embryos disproved.\nWhat’s more, a fossil found near Scott’s body of a plant named Glossopteris indica helped prove a contemporary theory that Antarctica had once been part of a supercontinent called Gondwanaland, which had a climate warm enough to support tree growth.\nToday, the Terra Nova Expedition is largely remembered for its bleak and fatal conclusion. For its members, however, it meant much more.\nBefore leaving Antarctica, the remaining Terra Nova crew members erected a large wooden cross at Ross Island, inscribed with a quote from Alfred Lord Tennyson’s Ulysses :\n“To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.”",
