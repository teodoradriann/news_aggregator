    "text": "Cyberattack complicates travel at Seattle airport with Labor Day weekend approaching As the upcoming [Labor Day holiday weekend is expected to send a record number of travelers](/article/labor-day-traffic-preview/61995960) to the skies, a [cyberattack](/article/seattle-airport-cyberattack-internet-outages/61984238) is forcing one of the nation's largest airports to go back to basics. Computer systems at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport went down Saturday, and officials say they still don't have an estimate for when they will be restored. \"We're working around the clock to get necessary systems back online and to mitigate impacts for passengers,\" aviation managing director Lance Lyttle said in a [news conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvzIYY7eVPE&t=9s) Sunday. Related video above: What travelers can expect this holiday weekend. The attack was focused on the Port of Seattle, which operates the airport. Online communications were affected, including [the website](https://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac/flight-status) used by the airport to advise passengers of their flight's status, although there was a workaround web page with basic information up and running Wednesday. Airport Wi-Fi and the baggage processing system are down and the port's email system went offline, officials said. Port of Seattle officials have not revealed any details about how the cyberattack was carried out, except to say that \"nefarious characters\" were involved. \"That is the question that is on everybody's mind, and all of our staff are working to figure out what exactly occurred,\" airport spokesperson Perry Cooper said in a Monday [news conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGiNZF5VsIE). The computer system outage comes as the TSA said it's prepared to screen a potentially record-setting 17 million people over the holiday travel period and weeks after the global airline industry was hobbled by a CrowdStrike software issue that led to massive flight delays and cancelations. While most major carriers at the airport process passengers using their own computer networks, which were unaffected, airport officials say smaller airlines and some international flights were impacted, forcing passengers to be checked in by hand. \"Be prepared for long queues as some airlines are providing manual bag tags and boarding passes,\" the airport advised in a [post on X](https://x.com/flySEA/status/1828539010047975611). The airport known to many travelers as Sea-Tac – though it officially [dropped](https://web.archive.org/web/20240422133259/https://www.portseattle.org/news/sea-airport-kicks-major-customer-focused-initiatives-and-amenities) that nickname in 2020 – enlisted a small army of Port of Seattle workers from other departments to don bright green vests and work in the terminal this week, advising people where to go and what to expect. Electronic screens, whose information is fed by the airport's computer network, were replaced by white dry-erase boards. Airport officials have emphasized their central aviation and security operations are not affected by the computer outage, with few cancellations and scattered flight delays reported. But it's still a headache for fliers in the bustling airport – the nation's [eleventh busiest](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2024-06/cy23-all-enplanements-preliminary.pdf) – who are being advised to check in online before arriving. \"It's crazy with all of the signs being down from the cyberattack and all of the crew that are out here having to manually do things that normally would be done electronically,\" a passenger told [CNN affiliate KING](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/sea-airport-still-dealing-effects-weekend-cyberattack/281-48891dbc-94b9-4243-81c2-c9c226a72d7c) Monday. The cyberattack affected the airport's automatic baggage processing, resulting in delays in some luggage arriving at the right destination, airport officials advised. \"If you can travel without checking bags, do so,\" Cooper said. The Port of Seattle says federal investigators, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, are looking into what happened. But as far as when the full website will be back up and the departure signs can light back up, airport officials remain in the dark. \"We do not have a time or a date as to when this will get resolved,\" Cooper [said Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXpu-F2nyXo).",

    "text": "Sunday’s AFC showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and the Miami Dolphins might come down to which team is the healthiest. If that’s the case, the Dolphins are playing from behind already.\nThe health concerns begin for both teams at the receiver position, as the No. 2 seed Miami Dolphins (11-4) prepare to play the No. 1 Baltimore Ravens (12-3) on Sunday in Baltimore. Miami’s Jaylen Waddle (ankle) and Baltimore’s Zay Flowers (calf)\ndid not practice for the second straight day Thursday.\nAccording to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Waddle is\nnot expected to play Sunday. While one report said Waddle’s injury isn’t “overly severe,” he was seen leaving the locker room Wednesday in a walking boot.\nMeanwhile, Flowers was also wearing short walking boot Wednesday after getting injured in the Ravens’ 33-19 victory over San Francisco, a game in which the rookie receiver caught nine passes for 72 yards and one touchdown.\nOther than Flowers, safety Kyle Hamilton, who had two interceptions against the 49ers, has been limited in practice this week while nursing a re-aggravated MCL sprain.\nRelated:\nNFL power rankings: Evaluating all 32 teams after 16 games\nRaheem Mostert among Miami Dolphins’ injured stars\nThe Miami Dolphins’ significant injuries extend beyond Waddle, who surpassed the 1,000-yard receiving mark for the third time in three seasons and has been critical to the Dolphins’ No. 1 rated passing attack while star receiver Tyreek Hill has dealt with a recent ankle injury.\nLike Waddle, Mostert (knee/ankle) didn’t practice Wednesday or Thursday, but he is\nexpected to suit up and play Sunday.\nThe 31-year-old back, tied with the 49ers’ Christian McCaffrey for the NFL lead in touchdowns (21), has dealt with injuries all season and has played in all 15 games during a career-best year, which includes 1,012 yards rushing.\nAt the same time, Hill, running back De’Von Achane (toe) and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa were limited participants in practice Thursday.\nGiven the length of each team’s injury list, Sunday’s game could be a war of attrition as the two teams battle for supremacy in the AFC. The Ravens will clinch the No. 1 seed with a victory, while the Dolphins, who still have a 24-percent chance of getting the No. 1 seed, will secure the AFC East title with a win.",

    "text": "MAPLEWOOD, Minn. — Shoppers may be out and about this week trying to snag some post-holiday deals, but it's more and more unlikely they're shopping at the local mall. Despite some empty storefronts, experts say malls aren't exactly going extinct - they're just adapting to a new environment, like the Shingle Creek Center in Brooklyn Center. Joyce Aboge will open her first restaurant there in January called Oga Madam Kitchen. Aboge is originally from Liberia and her restaurant will feature African flavors and focus on a traditional dine-in experience. \"Just to see everything coming together is just a blessing,\" said Aboge. \"It’s just unbelievable right now.\" She's one of several immigrant entrepreneurs banding together to buy the space - creating a co-op to help small and micro businesses thrive. \"This is a unique project,\" said the African Career, Education and Resources Executive Director Nelima Sitati Munene. \"It has not been done anywhere in our state as far as we know.\" She says that navigating the system can be challenging and discriminatory for immigrants and they want to help create more inclusive spaces and generational wealth. \"We had to step in and do this with them so that they could have a starting point,\" said Sitati Munene. With the help of investors, state and city funding there will be salon suites, a food hall, and a business center. Some are set to open this spring, including Jannie Seibure's travel agency. \"It's like a dream come true for me,\" said Seibure. \"At least we have a place we call our own, that we are not being denied access to, and we'll be able to grow our businesses.\" For the first time, she will move from a cramped office space in a nearby business tower to her own storefront in the strip mall. \"Coming into a strip mall makes your business more visible and access to a larger audience,\" said Seibure. Minnesota is home to a large African population and thanks to this new venture, some of them are now realizing their dreams. \"We're going to be successful,\" said Aboge about her restaurant. \"We claimed it, we received it, we're going to be.\" Another example of this type of expansion is happening in Maplewood where the owner of the popular Hmongtown Marketplace bought the old Sears building there. Toua Xiong tells KARE 11 it will be similar to the space in the Frogtown neighborhood in St. Paul. Xiong says it will also be more than a supermarket and includes plans for 30 restaurants, offices, and a kid's play area set to open in 2025.
