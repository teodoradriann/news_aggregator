    "text": "As the war enters its third month, the people of Gaza are increasingly at risk of starvation. With this donation from the Canadian Government, WFP plans to reach around 1.1 million displaced Gazans with food assistance in the form of food parcels and hot meals for displaced families. WFP has been mobilizing and delivering food for Gazan families every day since the beginning of the crisis, distributing food to displaced families in UN shelter and host communities. \"This donation supports our efforts to scale up our assistance to alleviate some of the suffering in Gaza and to prevent starvation, and we are grateful for their support,\" says WFP Representative and Country Director in Palestine Samer AbdelJaber. \"The Government of Canada is deeply concerned by the high levels of hunger throughout Gaza as a result of the conflict and humanitarian crisis. This investment will allow those in need to receive urgent food assistance and save lives,\" says Canada's Representative to the Palestinian Authority, David Da Silva. Recently, WFP has also supported community-led kitchens by providing them with food items that they use to make hot meals every day. These kitchens are mostly run by women dedicated to support their communities in the face of mass displacement and no access to cooking facilities. In addition to immediate food assistance, WFP, with this contribution, is working to support and expand the capacity of bakeries in Gaza to make bread available to provide longer-term food assistance to the population. The continued support of donors such as the Canadian Government is critical at this time to ensure lasting food assistance and support for the people of Gaza.

    "title": "Stephen Curry Opens Up About Not Being 'Bitter Old Head' After Retirement",
    "text": "Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant are some of the biggest NBA stars who are getting older and close to retiring. LeBron, at 40 years old, is very close to retirement, and in maybe two or three years, Stephen Curry will retire too.\nThere is no shame in acknowledging that as they age, they can no longer perform as like as their prime. So, it looks like Curry understands their time in the NBA is coming to an end, and he doesn’t want to annoy fans or younger players.\nStephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors captain, has hinted multiple times that this might be his last year playing basketball, or maybe just one more season. He has already started thinking about his retirement, and during a special “NBA OGs Convo” on Christmas Day, Curry again mentioned that retirement is near.\n“We’re not gonna be the bitter old heads coming back hating on the younger generation, we definitely have appreciation and admiration for what they’re able to do too.”✊\n– Steph Curry on leaving the game\npic.twitter.com/j5sgSTG6JR\n— NBACentral (@TheDunkCentral) January 16, 2025 In the interview, Curry was in talks with NBA legends LeBron James and Kevin Durant about their careers and life after basketball. Curry said he doesn’t want to be a retired player who criticizes younger players.\n“We’re not gonna be the bitter old heads that are coming back hating on the younger generation but definitely appreciation and admiration for what they’re able to do too,” Curry said. Then Durant added his thoughts by talking about their shared legacy and how they’ve built something big in basketball that’s hard for anyone to break.\nStephen Curry shuts down online critics with their latest win Stephen Curry shut down his critics with an amazing performance in the Warriors’ win against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Curry scored 31 points and made 8 assists, helping his team win 116-115 on January 15.\nThis win was a big response to the critics who had been talking a lot about the Warriors’ recent struggles and possible roster changes. After the game, Curry addressed the rumors in the media about the team.\nSteph Curry on SportsCenter following the Warriors gutsy 116-115 win over the TWolves tonight:\n\"All the twitter fingers who got deals that we need to make can kind of just shut up a little bit and let us figure this thing out.\" pic.twitter.com/8ivVKSRfev\n— KNBR (@KNBR) January 16, 2025 He said, “All the Twitter fingers who got deals we need to make can kind of shut up a little bit and let us figure this thing out.” He was positive about his teammates and said that they need to keep improving to stay competitive in the West.",

    "text": "Senator Beach Highlights Budget Funding for Jewish Federations Security TRENTON – Senator James Beach issued the following statement after the Senate voted to approve New Jersey’s Fiscal Year 2025 Budget (S-2025), which included $1.5 million in dedicated funding to support the security needs of the nine Jewish Federations of New Jersey:\n“Over the past year, there has been a significant uptick in antisemitic incidents in New Jersey. In 2023, reports of harassment, vandalism, and assault rose by 103% from the previous year,” said Senator Beach (D-Camden/Burlington). “It is imperative that the State does everything in its power to prevent further attacks on the Jewish community by investing in new safety measures. The $1.5 million appropriated to JFed Security in this year’s budget does just that.”\nJFed Security, an agency of the Jewish Federation of Southern New Jersey, partnered with the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest New Jersey to establish an intelligence center for the Jewish community. Currently, the center employs two open-source intelligence analysts, and will use the new funding to expand, with hopes of including all nine Jewish Federations in the State.\nAll Jewish Federation security programs coordinate with local, county, State, and federal law enforcement and share information across all platforms.",

    "text": "By Jamal Osborne ,\n56 minutes ago In Fairfax County, a Virginia state trooper’s patrol car was struck by a drunk driver after colliding with a tractor-trailer while conducting a DUI stop.\nLaw enforcement responded to a sedan that had come to a stop in the northbound lane of I-495 near Exit 52 in Fairfax County. The driver of the sedan remained inside the vehicle and was uncooperative, refusing to comply with the trooper’s instructions to exit the vehicle and relocate it to a safer spot on the shoulder of the road.\nRELATED: Married Pennsylvania State Trooper Charged For Violently Attacking Ex-Girlfriend & Illegally Committing Her To Psych Ward\nAs the trooper was attempting to interact with the driver of the sedan, a Jeep Cherokee collided with a tractor-trailer that had stopped because of the lane closure caused by the sedan. The force of the collision caused the Jeep to spin and hit the trooper’s patrol car, which then collided with the sedan and subsequently struck the trooper, who was positioned next to the driver’s side of the sedan. Authorities reported that the trooper sustained minor injuries and was taken to Fairfax INOVA Hospital for assessment.\nFollowing the incident, the trooper, who suffered minor injuries, was taken to Fairfax INOVA Hospital for evaluation. The driver of the sedan, identified as 43-year-old Erica D. Bernard from Albright, West Virginia, was also inside the vehicle when it was hit and received treatment for minor injuries. Bernard faces charges including driving under the influence of drugs, obstruction, possession of a schedule I or II substance, refusal of a blood/breath test, and improperly stopping a vehicle on a highway.\nRELATED: Ohio State Trooper Saves Choking Suspect Who Swallowed His Weed\nThe driver of the Jeep Cherokee has been identified as 35-year-old Joanna F. Hatch from Arlington, Virginia. Hatch was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.
