    "text": "Hobbs praises indictment of Arizona's 11 'fake electors' Gov. Katie Hobbs praised a state grand jury indictment of Republicans who allegedly sought to undermine President Joe Biden’s electoral victory over Donald Trump in Arizona in 2020. A state grand jury indicted 18 individuals, including the 11 so-called fake electors who sent documents to Washington falsely claiming Trump defeated Biden in Arizona. The indictment alleges that those individuals, including state Sens. Jake Hoffman (R-Gilbert) and Anthony Kern (R-Glendale), engaged in a conspiracy to deliver Arizona’s 11 electoral votes to the former president. Hobbs, a Democrat who oversaw that election as Arizona’s secretary of state, accused the indicted individuals of trying to undermine the will of voters. “As secretary of state, I oversaw many free, fair and secure elections in 2020, and these folks tried to undermine those elections,” Hobbs said. “They tried to undo the will of the voters in the state of Arizona.” She added, “No one’s above the law, and this shows that people can be held accountable, and I look forward to seeing it play out in the courts.” An indictment is not a conviction, and Hobbs declined to comment on whether she would like the fake electors to see jail time. But she did say the alleged conspirators did not hide their scheme and openly bragged about signing the fake elector document in 2020. “I mean, they were publicly bragging about it,” Hobbs said. That included a photo posted to the official Arizona Republican Party account on Twitter, now known as X, on Dec. 14, 2020, that showed the 11 fake electors when they met to vote for Trump. The Arizona Republican Party, which is mentioned throughout the indictment, criticized the investigation by Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes that led to the indictment. The list of indicted individuals included former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward and former Executive Director Greg Safsten along with current National Committeeman Tyler Bowyer. In a statement, the party alleged the investigation was a politically-motivated abuse of power. “The Arizona Republican Party condemns these actions in the strongest terms,” according to the statement. “They do nothing but undermine the trust in our state's legal processes and are clearly designed to silence dissent and weaponize the law against political opponents. We will not be deterred by this overreach.”",

    "title": "Guinea's economy struggles after fuel depot fire - YEN.COM.GH",
    "text": "Guinea's economy struggles after fuel depot fire PAY ATTENTION: [YEN Entertainment Awards 2023 VOTING is officially underway!](https://corp.yen.com.gh/yen-awards#) Almost two weeks after a huge fire in Guinea's main fuel depot brought death and destruction, anger is growing as the economy is reeling, with inflation rising, petrol rationed and no trucks moving merchandise. It took nine days for the blaze to be fully extinguished after a blast rocked the state oil company's main depot on December 18 in the capital Conakry, where 24 people died and another 454 were injured. But Guinea will likely feel the aftereffects for the foreseeable future. The west African nation remains one of the least developed countries in the [world](https://yen.com.gh/world/) despite being rich in minerals, including gold and bauxite. At Conakry's main market, Madina, most stores are closed. Merchandise trucks sit idled at the foot of buildings. Traffic has also come to a standstill at the port of Conakry, near the epicentre of the fire. The streets of the capital have fewer vehicles than usual -- except for the massive lines at petrol stations. With little fuel available, fishermen stay close to the coast where there are fewer fish to catch. The government -- led since September 2021 by a military junta that deposed the country's first democratically-elected president -- announced on Saturday that petrol distribution would resume. But fuel is rationed, limited to 25 litres per vehicle, and five litres per motorcycle and three-wheeled tuk-tuk. The use of jerrycans was banned to prevent a black market from emerging. \"There is suffering,\" said Mamadou Yaya Bah, a tuk-tuk taxi driver who sat for hours waiting for his turn at a service station in Conakry. He said his fares have tripled or quadrupled due to the rationing. Taxi drivers are not venturing out of the capital. \"We are never sure to find fuel in the interior of the country,\" said taxi driver Mamadou Saliou Balde. 'Too much hassle' Goods are not reaching areas outside of the capital, either, where roads are constantly in bad shape. Alpha Kabine Doumbouya, a trader who has three delivery trucks and five taxis in Kankan, 600 kilometres east of Conakry, said all of the vehicles have stopped service. \"If Conakry coughs, the rest of the country catches a cold,\" he said. \"The drivers are out of work. We are getting by here at my wife's restaurant while waiting for better days,\" he said. A customs officer at Guinea's border with Sierra Leone told AFP that the vehicles that used to go and get goods in Conakry are no longer coming. \"No fuel, no security, too much hassle,\" he said on condition of anonymity. Neighbouring countries are helping out. Sierra Leone has given Guinea permission to use its depots to store its petroleum products. On Wednesday, Ivory Coast said it would deliver 50 million litres of petrol a month to Guinea. 'Tipping point' The crisis is expected to cut economic growth by 0.7 percentage points this year, according to the National Statistics Institute. Transport costs have jumped by 60 percent nationally, said Guinean economist Tidiane Barry. Public finances will also take a hit as revenue from the energy and transport sectors fall, Barry said. Inflation is expected to top 10 percent in December, and more than 15 percent in Conakry alone, the economist added. At the Taouyah market, Hawa Toure's grocery bag was empty. \"I have nothing to put in my bag because prices at the market have suddenly become so high,\" she said. Vegetable seller Aminata Camara was falling asleep in his stall. \"I'm still waiting for the first customer,\" he said. \"I don't know what Guinea did to god to deserve this punishment.\" Barry said the disaster is a \"tipping point\" for Guinea as it has exposed the vulnerabilities of its economy, including its reliance on oil. But it is also a chance to rethink Guinea's economic strategy. \"Investing in safe infrastructure, diversifying the economy and strengthening regional cooperation are key steps towards sustainable and resilient economic development,\" Barry said.

No sé dónde está esta carta. Lo hice por si tuviera algún problema de salud que me impidiera ejercer mi ministerio y no estuviera del todo consciente como para renunciar”, declaró en 2013.\nIncluso esa parte de la carta también viene plasmada en su libro ‘Esperanza’: \"Creo que el ministerio petrino es ad vitam y, por tanto, no veo condiciones para una dimisión. Las cosas cambiarían si se produjera un impedimento físico grave y, en ese caso, ya firmé al inicio del pontificado la carta con la renuncia que está depositada en la Secretaría de Estado”.\nTAMBIÉN TE PUEDE INTERESAR: ¡EVITA CORRALÓN Y MULTAS!
