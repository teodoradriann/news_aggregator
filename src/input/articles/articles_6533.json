    "title": "Jarrod Bowen extends West Ham's unbeaten run to four matches at Southampton",
    "text": "Jarrod Bowen struck a 59th-minute winner for West Ham to consign new Southampton head coach Ivan Juric to a 1-0 defeat in his first match in charge.\nFormer Torino boss Juric had watched Sunday’s goalless draw at Fulham from the stand to give renewed hope to the Premier League’s bottom club, but they suffered a 14th defeat of the campaign to remain eight points from safety.\nIt was not all good news for opposite number Julen Lopetegui after he watched Hammers’ goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski suffer a nasty first-half blow, which saw him leave the pitch on a stretcher after 36 minutes.\nVAR was required at the start of the second period after Guido Rodriguez had a red card downgraded to a yellow before Bowen grabbed his sixth goal of the season to extend West Ham’s unbeaten run to four matches.\nJuric’s first major call was to drop Saints starlet Tyler Dibling and hand only a second start of the season to forward Paul Onuachu.\nWest Ham welcomed back Carlos Soler but lost Lucas Paqueta to suspension, and the former almost put them ahead in the fourth minute.\nAaron Wan-Bissaka ended a lung-bursting run with a fine cross for Soler, who smashed the ball against the crossbar before Rodriguez’s follow-up strike was deflected away from goal.\nIt was a let-off for sluggish Southampton, but they quickly improved and Onuachu headed wide after Kyle Walker-Peters impressively kept in a cross by fellow wing-back Yuki Sugawara.\nMore fine play resulted in Adam Armstrong being able to pick out Mateus Fernandes, but his low header was saved by Fabianski.\nWest Ham’s Max Kilman was brought off soon after due to a shoulder issue before Fabianski thwarted Walker-Peters’ weak effort and then produced an even better save to deny Onuachu after 25 minutes.\nWalker-Peters dug out a cross and Onuachu’s header back across goal was superbly clawed away by Fabianski, who unfortunately exited proceedings not long after.\nFabianski was caught late by Nathan Wood from a corner and after seven minutes of medical attention left the pitch to a standing ovation in the 36th minute.\nThe lengthy stoppage took the sting out of the contest until Wan-Bissaka volleyed wide after an excellent run by Mohammed Kudus and Onuachu then had another header saved deep into 10 minutes added on at the end of the first half.\nSaints thought their cause was boosted in the 51st minute when Rodriguez was shown a red card.\nHe caught Walker-Peters late but a VAR check told referee Lewis Smith to review the incident on the pitchside monitor and he downgraded his original decision to a yellow card.\nThings went from bad to worse for Southampton a minute before the hour mark as West Ham took the lead.\nIt started with a miscued pass by Sugawara gifting the Hammers a corner. After they kept the ball alive from the set-piece, a cross by Edson Alvarez was headed back across goal by Tomas Soucek and flicked on by Niclas Fullkrug, which allowed Bowen to poke home.\nSugawara was immediately hooked by Juric before Onuachu had soft penalty appeals waved away after a shove by Konstantinos Mavropanos.\nFernandes dragged wide for Saints shortly afterwards and Juric turned to Dibling with 17 minutes left.\nAdam Lallana was also introduced but Dibling could only curl over from 20 yards in stoppage time as Southampton lost again.\nMore from Sporting Life\nSafer gambling\nWe are committed in our support of safer gambling.

    "text": "'I AM BACK!': Rocket sinks Ange's men | 00:43 Alex Conrad from Fox Sports @alexhconrad December 29th, 2023 10:49 am\nTottenham Hotspur boss Ange Postecoglou bemoaned VAR’s decision to let Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk off with a yellow card after his horror challenge on Dejan Kulusevski.\nWith Brighton up 4-1 and into the final 10 minutes of regular time, Dunk flew into a tackle on Tottenham’s Swedish star.\nDespite winning the ball, Dunk’s studs went into Kulusevski’s ankle and the challenge left the Tottenham star writhing in pain.\nThankfully for Postecoglou, Kulusevski was able to return to the field after receiving medical treatment.\nAlthough Kulusevski was relatively unharmed by Dunk’s bruising challenge — which also forced him out of Brighton’s next match due to suspension — Postecoglou was left fuming at VAR’s inactivity.\nWhen asked about VAR’s decision to award a penalty in the first half thanks to Kulusevski’s shirt-pull on Danny Welbeck, Postecoglou took aim at the time it took to give a penalty with a tongue-in-cheek response.\nAnd he most certainly didn’t forget about Dunk’s tackle, either.\n“It (Kulusevski’s foul on Welbeck) was obviously clear and obvious because it only took him (referee Jarred Gillett) three minutes to see it on the screen and VAR picked up everything today except the one tackle which nearly cost me another player,” Postecoglou said in his post-match press conference.\nBrighton put Ange's winning run to bed | 01:59\nMORE COVERAGE\nPL Wrap: VAR controversy strikes Gunners; Ange’s Spurs fall agonisingly short in late comeback\n‘Beyond an A-League club’: Coach’s stunning ‘global corporation’ spray after historic thrashing\n‘Will never be worse’: PL star’s ‘impossibly’ bad meltdown against former club\n“So that’s their decisions.”\nHad Kulusevski come off worse for wear, it would have robbed Postecoglou of yet another star player in an already-thin squad.\nThe Australian boss was once again forced to field a defensive backline comprised of four natural fullbacks after star centre back Cristian Romero suffered a hamstring strain.\nPostecoglou expects Romero to miss “probably four or five weeks”, adding to Tottenham’s well-documented injury woes across the squad.\nWith Romero out injured, it leaves Postecoglou without yet another first-team figure as Micky van de Ven, James Maddison, Ryan Sessegnon, Ivan Perisic and Rodrigo Bentancur all remain sidelined through injury while Yves Bissouma is suspended after his red card against Nottingham Forest.\nAlthough the likes of Van de Ven and Maddison could return in January, it’s unlikely to stop Postecoglou from seeking out reinforcements in the transfer window to add to his threadbare squad.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs maintains Buy on Flextronics post-acquisition By Investing.com",
    "text": "Thursday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) reaffirmed its Buy rating on Flextronics (NASDAQ: FLEX) with a steady price target of $39.00. The endorsement follows Flextronics' announcement of its intent to purchase Crown Technical Systems for $325 million in cash. This strategic move is expected to bolster Flextronics' position in the power distribution and protection systems industry.\nOn Thursday, Flextronics disclosed the acquisition of Crown Technical Systems, a provider of modular solutions and products for medium voltage switchgear, control, and relay. The deal, valued at $325 million, will be conducted entirely in cash. Crown Technical Systems is anticipated to contribute approximately $120 million in revenue with a high-teens EBITDA margin by the end of its fiscal year on March 31, 2025.\nThe acquisition is seen as a strategic fit within Flextronics' Platforms & Power thesis, which posits that the rising demand for AI, intelligent machines, and electrification will present new opportunities in industrial technology sectors, particularly for datacenter and utilities/grid applications. Goldman Sachs views Flextronics as well positioned to benefit from these trends.\nFlextronics had previously indicated that its existing portfolio of products and services could address over 80% of the datacenter market opportunity. The addition of Crown Technical Systems is expected to enhance Flextronics' capabilities and market reach in this area.\nThe transaction is part of Flextronics' broader strategy to expand its influence in the industrial technology market, leveraging the growth in demand for advanced power solutions. With the acquisition of Crown Technical Systems, Flextronics aims to strengthen its offerings and capitalize on the anticipated growth in this sector.\nIn other recent news, Flex (NASDAQ: FLEX ) Ltd. has announced a series of strategic moves and financial results. The company reported strong Q1 earnings for fiscal year 2025, with net sales of $6.3 billion and a GAAP operating income of $233 million. Flex also plans to acquire Crown Technical Systems for $325 million, which is expected to enhance its capabilities in power distribution and protection systems.\nThe company has also partnered with JetCool to develop server solutions for AI servers and high-density computing. Further, Flex has approved significant supplemental equity awards for two of its top executives, aiming at long-term retention and incentivizing superior shareholder returns. In addition, Flex's shareholders approved a share repurchase plan with a maximum expenditure of $1.7 billion.\nSeveral analysts have provided their takes on Flex's recent developments. Goldman Sachs maintained their Buy rating on the company, while Craig-Hallum upgraded Flex's stock from Hold to Buy. However, JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) revised its outlook, reducing the price target to $39.00 due to challenges in the automotive and industrial sectors. These are recent developments that highlight the strategic moves and financial performance of Flex Ltd.\nInvestingPro Insights\nFlextronics' (NASDAQ: FLEX) strategic acquisition of Crown Technical Systems aligns well with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market cap of $13.87 billion and a P/E ratio of 15.46 suggest a reasonably valued company, especially considering its growth prospects in the industrial technology sector.\nInvestingPro Tips highlight that Flextronics has been \"aggressively buying back shares\" and offers a \"high shareholder yield,\" indicating a strong focus on returning value to shareholders. This approach, combined with the recent acquisition, demonstrates management's commitment to both organic and inorganic growth strategies.\nThe company's profitability is underscored by its positive earnings over the last twelve months and analysts' predictions of continued profitability. Moreover, Flextronics' strong performance is reflected in its impressive 81.94% price total return over the past year, and it's currently trading near its 52-week high at 97.38% of that level.\nThese insights complement the article's focus on Flextronics' strategic positioning in the growing AI, intelligent machines, and electrification markets. The acquisition of Crown Technical Systems appears to be a calculated move to capitalize on these trends, potentially driving further growth and shareholder value.\nFor investors seeking a deeper understanding of Flextronics' potential, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips, providing a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market position.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

    "text": "Arellano University received the biggest financial assistance in the volleyball program of organizers of the recent 2024 Shakey’s Super League Pre-Season Championship.\nThe school received a check of P1.759 million from the organizers, who raised a total of ₱13,936,050 from donations during the tournament.\n“It’s a great help. We cannot deny na hulog ng langit iyan,” said Arellano University sports director Peter Cayco after receiving the check from Shakey’s Pizza Ventures General Manager Oliver Sicam during a ceremony on Wednesday afternoon in Malate.\nThe total amount was raised through the pizza chain’s promotion of the Shakey’s Super League Bundle. The rest of the funds were distributed to the 18 participating schools, which are preparing for the coming National Collegiate Athletic Association and University Athletic Association of the Philippines seasons.\nCayco said that while the majority of the funds will be for their volleyball program and the needs of their athletes, they will also allocate some funds to other sports disciplines.\nJose Rizal University received P902,008 in funding, while the College of St. Benilde and Letran got P896,758, and P855,908 respectively.\nThe Sherwin Meneses-coached National University, which beat La Salle in a 23-25, 25-18, 25-16, 25-20 Game 2 victory, won a third straight Shakey’s Super League Collegiate Pre-season Championship title last November 24 at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum.\nThe Lady Bulldogs drew strength from the pair of Alyssa Solomon and Bella Belen, who were also around last year.\nNU made it to the finals after getting past the Far Eastern University Lady Tamaraws in the semifinals.",
