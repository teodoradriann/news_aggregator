    "text": "Triple threat Michele Swersey – graphic designer, jewelry maker and painter – is currently showcasing her work at the Freeport Memorial Library.\nSwersey’s exhibit, “Dream Obscurer,” will be on display until Wednesday, July 30.\nSwersey’s love for art began when she received second place in an art competition at five years old. Since then, art has been a constant in Swersey’s life.\n“It’s very cathartic,” Swersey said. “It was a way for me to escape whatever problems are going on. I can always escape into my art.”\n“Dream Obscurer” is a compilation of acrylic on paper paintings that explore the disorienting and unsettling space between sleep and wakefulness. To fully explore this theme, many of these pieces feature a sleeping girl battling sleep paralysis and different phobias, including monsters, bugs, and reptiles.\n“I had a best friend pass away from cancer, and the first painting that I did was of a woman sleeping with ‘Death’ playing with her hair,” Swersey said. “It had to do with the idea of sleep paralysis, where your body is paralyzed, but your mind is awake, and you can’t get yourself to wake up.”\nSwersey uses her artwork to explore and represent different phobias. Photo courtesy of Michele Swersey. Most of Swersey’s paintings, which take months to complete, are purely instinctual. The theme, meaning, and content of each painting are decided as she creates it and afterward.\n“​​I don’t know what I’m gonna paint until I paint it,” Swersey said. “So, I don’t know what the theme is, and as I’m drawing, it just comes out.”\nEven though Swersey has been creating since she was young, she knew she didn’t want to pursue being a painter full-time. She currently works at Schneps Media LI.\n“I decided not to make [art] something that I would make money from, because I wanted to paint what I wanted to paint,” Swersey said. “I didn’t want to tell me what to do, and I find it very cathartic and therapeutic.”\nDespite not wanting to be a full-time painter, Swersey has been able to keep art in her life by becoming a graphic designer and by being hired to paint the likeness of people’s houses.\nSince her showcase, though, Swersey has been open to selling her pieces. If you want to buy a piece from Swersey’s collection or speak with the artist herself, email her at mermaidsnmayhem@gmail.com .\n“I think [art is] part of what defines me,” Swersey said. “I feel like I would not be happy if I were not painting at any time. So, it’s always a part of me.”\nSwersey mainly paints with acrylic on paper. Photo courtesy of Michele Swersey.",

Tras anunciar que se encuentra embarazada, la pequeña de las Campos se ha convertido en el centro de todas las miradas, lo cual ha provocado cientos de críticas a cada paso que da.\nLa joven no puede ocultar lo feliz que se encuentra con la nueva etapa de su vida y por ello no duda en compartir con todos sus seguidores de Instagram cómo va creciendo su barriga. Sin embargo, no a todo el mundo le parece correcto que siga usando camisetas cortas y tops en verano.\nPor ello, Rubio se ha visto en la obligación de responder a todas las críticas: \" A diario recibo mensajes y comentarios de personas ofendidas, molestas, porque enseñe mi tripita de embarazada \". Y es que, como así ha dejado claro, ella no ha cambiado de estilo, por lo que no entiende por qué \"cuando la tenía plana no le molestaba a nadie\".\nAlejandra Rubio ha hecho una reflexión. alerubioc/ INSTAGRAM \"Futuras mamás: ¿a vosotras también os hacen este tipo de comentarios? \", le ha preguntado a sus seguidores mostrando la imagen que ha causado el revuelo. En esta la joven aparece enseñando su nuevo pelo vestido con una chaqueta que permite entrever su ya avanzado estado.\n\"Alejandra, con todo el cariño del mundo, ¿por qué esa exhibición de la barriguita?, me cuesta entender que salgas siempre así\", \"no veo a nadie como tú vas vestida\" o \"espero que en invierno no enseñes la barriga también\", han sido solo algunas de las críticas que ha recibido en la publicación.",

As it turns out, this was an automatic update which is done for thousands of other games. The news came as a shock for fans, who had waited for the title for quite a while.

The post received more than 700 upvotes and thousands of clicks in less than a day, showing the community's hunger for a new entry.\nUnfortunately, it was simply not meant to be.

Former pacer Harmison who is also a close friend of Stokes questioned England arriving in India just three days before the five-match Test series. He feels that the lack of acclimation could turn out to be a recipe for disaster. He also went on to claim that England could go on to \"deserve to get beaten 5-0\".

Harmison suggested that England's approach regarding their Test series against India was insufficient while telling talkSPORT as quoted from Sky Sports, \"If England go in three days before, they deserve to get beat 5-0, they really do. I'm an old man, that's what they'll say. Times have changed, but preparation hasn't changed. I love this new approach, I love Ben Stokes and [head coach] Brendon McCullum. But I'm sorry, going three days before... You'd never do that for an Ashes series. You'd never go to Australia three days before the Gabba, so why go three days before Hyderabad? For me it stinks, it absolutely stinks,\" Harmison added.

The experienced all-rounder had recently come out of ODI retirement to participate in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, where he played as a specialist batter. His issues with his knee have prevented him from playing his role as an all-rounder effectively as he has rarely bowled as of late. He went for knee surgery after the World Cup which was successful and now it is time for him to undergo rehabilitation.

The warmer climate is attributed to lack of western disturbances and easterly winds. IMD predicts above-average temperatures in north-western India and increased rainfall in southern regions during November. - Country: - India In an unprecedented weather development, India has experienced its warmest October since 1901, with average temperatures rising 1.23 degrees Celsius above the typical norm, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). During a press conference, IMD Director General Mrityunjay Mohapatra explained that this unusual warmth can be attributed to the lack of western disturbances and an influx of easterly winds caused by active low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal. The IMD forecasts that north-western India's temperatures will linger 2-5 degrees above typical levels for the next fortnight, whereas the southern peninsula anticipates above-normal rainfall due to the northeast monsoon.
