    "text": "Israel used a U.S.-made bomb in a deadly U.N. school strike in Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel, and NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip — The Israeli military made improper use of a U.S.-made bomb in a deadly airstrike Thursday on a United Nations school compound in Gaza, according to current and former U.S. defense officials who analyzed an image of the bomb remnants documented by NPR at the site. The munition used was a GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, according to a Pentagon official and a former U.S. Air Force official. It is the same kind of bomb, [according to](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/middleeast/israel-us-rafah-bombs.html) The New York Times, that Israel used in an airstrike last month that killed dozens of displaced civilians at a tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, an incident Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu called](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/27/nx-s1-4982787/israeli-strike-kills-dozens-45-in-an-area-of-rafah-that-didnt-get-evacuation-orders) a “tragic mishap.” Israel’s army said it was targeting a group of militants inside two classrooms at a U.N. school in Nuseirat, a central Gaza refugee camp. But the 2 a.m. strike killed at least 32 people, including seven children, according to Dr. Khalil Doqran, director of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza. Families displaced in the war are sheltering in the school. At the hospital morgue, NPR documented one body bag labeled as containing the body parts of five children. The Israeli army said the militants it was targeting had participated in the deadly Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel and were plotting attacks from inside the school. Army spokesman Peter Lerner said the military called off the strike twice to minimize collateral damage, and that he was unaware of any civilian casualties in the strike. The Pentagon official told NPR that Israel had used the bomb improperly because the bomb is intended to cause low collateral damage but caused a high number of casualties. “Israel is using the most advanced, precise and effective bombs the U.S. produces like a cudgel,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss Israel’s conduct. Wes Bryant, the former Air Force official, said the U.S. military would have most likely called off such a strike where militants were holed up in a U.N. school housing displaced civilians because the estimated number of civilian casualties would be high. “What strikes me most about these most recent strikes by the IDF [Israeli military], in which large numbers of civilians have again been killed, is that they are using munitions intended to be both precision and low collateral damage — but they are not employing them in a manner in which those qualities are applied,” said Bryant, a retired master sergeant and former special operations joint terminal attack controller in the elite special warfare branch of the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. State Department called on Israel to name those killed in the strike. The Israeli military declined NPR's request for comment on the kind of munitions used, but identified the names of nine men it said were militants killed in the strike. The U.N. school in Nuseirat is sheltering families that had been displaced multiple times: those who fled north Gaza to Rafah in south Gaza at the start of the war, and who then fled Israel’s offensive on Rafah to the U.N. school. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, said the school compound is sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the moment. “Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,” he [said in a statement](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1798681289052283206) on the social media platform X. One family had reached the school two weeks ago and was killed while they were sleeping, relatives told NPR. In the aftermath of the strike, rubble covered the school courtyard and blood covered the school staircase. Two boys with head and leg injuries remained in the school compound. Children were collecting wood from among the rubble to use as firewood, and U.N. officials were trying to repair a door and windows of the compound for families still sheltering there. At the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital morgue, a mother grieved over her dead son’s body. The hospital director said more than 140 people have been killed since Wednesday in central Gaza as Israel launched a new offensive in the area. “The scene inside the emergency room inside Al-Aqsa Hospital is even worse than yesterday. They have no chance to reorganize from ... yesterday’s events, and now they are struck with mass casualties after mass casualties,” said Karin Huster, a medical adviser for humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, who is at the hospital. “Patients are on the floor. There is blood everywhere ... dead bodies are not being taken to the morgue because the facility is overwhelmed.” NPR's Daniel Estrin reported from Tel Aviv; NPR producer Anas Baba reported from Gaza.

    "title": "Arab Author Criticizes Spread of Underground Mosques in Muslim Countries",
    "text": "“In recent decades, we have encountered a phenomenon known as underground mosques in Islamic countries. Despite their seemingly pious appearance, there are criticisms regarding this issue,” Ali Abdulraouf wrote in an article published by Al Jazeera.\nFollowing are excerpts from this article:\nIn the 1980s, a phenomenon emerged in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, which, although it appeared to be positive, required questioning and examination at its core. This phenomenon, which can be described as “underground mosques”, was observed in many residential buildings in Cairo and later spread to other Arab cities.\nUrban and security authorities, in collaboration with Egypt’s Ministry of Awqaf, allowed the owners of these residential buildings to convert part of the building’s basement into a place for prayer, which they referred to as a zawiya, prayer room, or mosque.\nMany property owners took advantage of this golden opportunity, not necessarily to accommodate those wishing to perform their prayers, but because this decision included generous tax exemptions for those who dedicated their basements for the sacred duty of prayer.\nThus, the experience of praying involved going to a basement, to an empty, damp, and dark place with a wooden door labeled ‘Mosque of Light’!\nGradually, our disregard for the value of a place for prayer in a human, spiritual, architectural, and civil context increased, to the point where this neglect spread not only to private buildings but also to public ones. For example, we now see that many office buildings convert one of their small rooms, usually next to the restroom, into a prayer room.\nAlso, in large and luxurious complexes, unattractive and dark basements or rooms next to the restrooms are designated for prayer, forcing us to walk through long, cold corridors to reach the prayer room. It’s as if we are ashamed of praying or doing something inappropriate!\nThese complexes, which include large shopping centers, international chain supermarkets, ice skating rinks, restaurants and cafes, indoor gardens, and other recreational facilities, have marginalized prayer and placed very little value on it.\nRead More:\nSome might argue that the owners of shopping centers are businesspeople who are solely focused on making a profit, meaning every square meter of the complex must generate income for them. This is a valid business logic, but we need to consider this issue not only from the perspective of financial gain, which forces people to sacrifice their values and principles, but also from human, social, and spiritual perspectives in all their dimensions.\nIt seems that at a time Islam has been facing many challenges, including the attempts to damage its image and diminish value of those who adhere to it, the time has come for a revolution in the spaces designated for prayer in residential, governmental, and office buildings, as well as in commercial complexes. It is time for the prayer space to be central, beautiful, and captivating, conveying highly positive messages about Islam and Muslims to others. It should be a space that attracts people to prayer and invites them to benefit from its facilities.\nThe space designated for prayer should not be one where people perform their religious duties out of necessity and quickly return to shopping centers and recreational places. We must work together to locate prayer rooms in places other than basements, dark rooms, and marginal areas, and instead in locations worthy of prayer, which is considered the “pillar of religion”.\nIf prayer truly is the pillar of religion, shouldn’t the place where it is performed be deserving of it, a source of joy and happiness, and a place where people are encouraged towards Islamic values? Shouldn’t the prayer room be a place of friendship and spiritual and physical peace, rather than a cold and damp basement?\n4264234",

    "text": "Tejas Parasher, a UCLA assistant professor of political theory in the political science department and the International Institute, has been awarded the 2024 Political Theory Prize by the European Consortium for Political Research, or ECPR, for his book, “Radical Democracy in Modern Indian Political Thought.” The Political Theory Prize recognizes an outstanding debut book in political theory written in English.\nParasher’s book, which explores Indian radical democrats from the early to mid-20th century, “offers a new reading of the history of anti-colonial thought, bringing into the canon the works of forgotten thinkers such as Brajendra Nath Seal, Beni Prasad and K.T. Shah, all of whom produced profound and rich rejections of parliamentary democracy,” the 2024 Political Theory Prize jury said in a statement.\nThis is his second award for the book. In June, he received the 2024 Best First Book Award from the Foundation of Political Theory section of the American Political Science Association. His research interests include modern political and legal theory — with a focus on empire, statehood and self-determination. He’s working on a second book about the concept of imperial parliamentarism in late 19th- and early 20th-century political thought in British India.\n“I am incredibly honored to receive the 2024 ECPR Political Theory Prize,” Parasher said. “I am especially excited (and hopeful) that this prestigious recognition will help bring greater attention to global, non-Western traditions of democratic thought within political theory.”",
