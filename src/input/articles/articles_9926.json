    "text": "Filipe d’Avillez and John Pontifex (ZENIT News / Nigeria, 12.28.2023).- CHURCH leaders have confirmed the killing of more than 160 people in Nigeria’s Middle Belt over Christmas, attacks which they say saw the “deliberate targeting” of Christians. The killing spree began on 23rd December and went on for four days, with 26 villages in Plateau State coming under fire. Speaking to Aid to the Church in Need (ACN), the Catholic charity for persecuted and other suffering Christians, Father Andrew Dewan, director of communications of Pankshin Diocese where the attacks took place, described how “people were summarily shot and killed”, with churches, clinics and grain stores torched. Describing the scene in Tudun Mazat, which he had visited only that morning for Christmas Mass, Father Dewan said: “The attackers stormed the community in the evening, just about the time most people were eating their dinner… “Before people could raise the alarm, the bandits were already upon them. “People were summarily shot and killed, houses and corn that had been harvested were set ablaze, churches and clinics were also set on fire.” He said that very night 20 other communities were attacked in what bore all the signs of coordinated attacks. Confirming reports that Fulani militia or mercenaries were to blame, he said that survivors and eyewitnesses reported that in mixed Fulani/Christian communities “not one Fulani was affected and no Fulani houses were burned”. Father Dewan said: “The unprovoked attacks were well-coordinated and deliberate, targeting communities that were Christians specifically. “I live in this same community and can confirm that in the areas where these attacks took place the victims were 100 percent Christians, except for a few. But even at that, the non-Christians were isolated.” He added: “For those who believe that this conflict is not religious, this latest attack proves that it is clearly a religious conflict. “The fact that it took place at Christmas, and the deliberate targeting of Christians in a mixed community where Muslims are not attacked, clearly bears all the hallmarks of a religious conflict.” Father Dewan said that up to 167 fatalities had been confirmed in attacks on villages centred on Bokkos, but also involving Barkin Ladi and Mangu. He said the total dead “is definitely going to rise because there are still many people in hospitals, with varying degrees of injuries and wounds.” Condemning the “senseless killing”, Regina Lynch, Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) International executive president, said: “Our Christian brothers and sisters killed in Nigeria, and in other countries of the world, are the ‘Holy Innocents’ of the 21st century. “The bloodshed as followers of Jesus will, we are sure, be the seed of new Christians.” She added: “We call on the government to finally confront this problem and provide safety to its citizens and urge our friends and benefactors to keep praying for Nigeria, just as we pledge to continue helping in whatever way we can.”",

namely Kedah, Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelantan — providing habitat to endangered flora and fauna species.\nThe foundation’s conservation strategies in this key area focus on improving ecological connectivity and activating community-led conservation and anti-poaching efforts.\nTo date, nearly RM27 million has been directed towards these initiatives, part of a broader RM206 million YSD investment in environmental protection since 2009.\nThe event finale featured the exclusive screening of the YSD WildRoots docuseries , which highlighted the foundation’s ongoing commitment to environmental protection.\nThe project was a collaborative effort with eight partners; namely the Tropical Rainforest Conservation and Research Centre TRCRC, Persatuan Pelindung Harimau Malaya (Rimau), Nature Based Solutions (NBS), Gaia, Perak State Parks Corporation (PSPC), Regional Environmental Awareness Cameron Highlands (Reach), and SD Guthrie Berhad to bolster these efforts in four out of the eight states along the ecological corridor.\nIn attendance were YSD chairman Tunku Tan Sri Imran Tuanku Ja’afar, chief executive officer Yatela Zainal Abidin, YSD governing council member and Sime Darby Berhad group CEO Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson and YSD governing council member Puan Sri Normah Hashim as well as management and the employees of YSD donor companies; namely SD Guthrie Berhad, Sime Darby Berhad, and Sime Darby Property Berhad along with project and corporate partners including GLC Demi Rakyat dan Negara and government representatives, marking a united front in environmental stewardship.\nYayasan Sime Darby chairman Tunku Tan Sri Imran Tuanku Ja’afar delivers his speech at the foundation’s World Environment Day 2024 event. — Picture by Yusof Mat Isa\nYayasan Sime Darby chairman Tunku Tan Sri Imran Tuanku Ja’afar delivers his speech at the foundation’s World Environment Day 2024 event. — Picture by Yusof Mat Isa\nSpeaking at the event, Tunku Imran said the role of the ecological corridor is vital in Malaysia’s biodiversity as it is home to critical species such as the Malayan tigers and the hornbills.\n\"Aside from our collaborative work on the ground in the central forest spine on human-wildlife coexistence management, anti-poaching efforts, and planting of trees, YSD focuses on advocacy and spreading important knowledge on saving the environment with innovative initiatives.\n\"With the screening of the WildRoots docuseries today, our conversation about sustainable practices and community development for environment conservation continues.”\nThe short docuseries captured various aspects of Malaysia’s biodiversity, the ongoing conservation efforts as well as dangers and challenges facing the environment and wildlife.\nThe docuseries also featured Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad lauding YSD’s initiative with its project partners.\n\"The WildRoots docuseries truly encapsulates the government and many other stakeholders’ work and commitment in saving the central forest spine, inviting Malaysians from every segment of society to contribute to preserving our environmental heritage,” he said.\nYayasan Sime Darby panel discussion involving Peninsular Malaysia Forestry Department senior director (Forest Management Division) Datuk Ahmad Fadzil Abdul Majid, Rimau president Lara Ariffin, Terengganu State Parks Management Council chief assistant director Shahriz Ahmad Laili and TRCRC director Dzaeman Dzulkifli, Executive. — Picture courtesy of Yayasan Sime Darby\nYayasan Sime Darby panel discussion involving Peninsular Malaysia Forestry Department senior director (Forest Management Division) Datuk Ahmad Fadzil Abdul Majid, Rimau president Lara Ariffin, Terengganu State Parks Management Council chief assistant director Shahriz Ahmad Laili and TRCRC director Dzaeman Dzulkifli, Executive. — Picture courtesy of Yayasan Sime Darby\nThe event also saw a panel discussion featuring conservation insights from Peninsular Malaysia Forestry Department senior director (Forest Management Division) Datuk Ahmad Fadzil Abdul Majid, Terengganu State Parks Management Council chief assistant director Shahriz Ahmad Laili, TRCRC executive director Dzaeman Dzulkifli, and Rimau president Lara Ariffin.\nThe event concluded with a sharing session on the importance of hornbill species and their protection within the central forest spine landscape by Gaia environmental awareness and education director Sanjitpaal Singh.\nThere will also be the inaugural National Hornbill Day starting this November.\nFor those who wish to lend a helping hand to the conservation efforts, YSD invites the public to engage in ongoing projects by volunteering with its partners in various initiatives promoting reforestation, environment conservation and education.",

    "text": "PALM CITY FLA. — A construction crew narrowly escaped the path of a reckless driver, highlighting the tough balance law enforcement faces when deciding whether or not to pursue a fleeing suspect.\nCody Nance, 33, of Arkansas was arrested this week in Martin County after deputies said he fled law enforcement at speeds exceeding 100 mph, later crashing near a nighttime construction crew.\nA video posted on the Martin County Sheriff's Office's Facebook page showed the dramatic end of the pursuit of the driver.\n\"We had probably as horrific a car chase as you could have, the kind that keeps you up at night in fear that fleeing car would kill an innocent bystander,\" Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said.\nChief Deputy John Budensiek said the incident started when a deputy tried to pull over Nance in the Jensen Beach area for a tag issue.\nBudensiek said Nance took off toward Port St. Lucie driving recklessly at more than 100 mph, leading the deputy on a brief chase, before the deputy was forced to stop pursuing to protect public safety.\n\"Our deputy, because of our pursuit policy, was forced to terminate the ground pursuit,\" Budensiek said.\nBudensiek said the sheriff's office helicopter kept following Nance from the sky.\nAerial video showed the car getting on the northbound lanes of Interstate 95 near Becker Road going the wrong way, narrowly missing another driver.\nThe car then continued speeding back toward Martin County and headed directly toward the intersection of Martin Highway and Citrus Boulevard in Palm City, where CWR contracting crews were paving the road.\nWPTV Chief Deputy John Budensiek explains to WPTV reporter Kate Hussey the difficult balance taken to pursue suspects while keeping the public safe. \"Our deputies had to reengage in order to stop the vehicle from careening into the construction crews,\" Budensiek said.\nBudensiek said deputies tried to intercept the car by putting up stop sticks to pop the car's tires before it reached the construction site.\nTrevor Pearson, a safety specialist with CWR Construction, said he received a call from a deputy warning him to clear out his crews.\n\"We’re really thankful for the sheriff's department,\" Pearson said.\nFour minutes after Pearson said crews cleared out, aerial video showed Nance's car hit Stop Sticks, careen off the road and slam into a rented water truck.\n\"Due to his excessive speed, Nance overcorrected when he hit the stingers and slammed into a water truck while construction workers watched from the side of the road,\" the sheriff's office said.\nPearson said multiple workers could have been hit.\nWPTV Trevor Pearson discusses the scary moments road crews experienced when the suspect crashed near their work site. \"There were probably 10-12 guys working that got to go home that night,\" Pearson told WPTV reporter Kate Hussey.\n\"Without their response, that might not have been the outcome?\" Hussey asked.\n\"That's very well possible,\" answered Pearson.\nNance got out of the vehicle and was taken into custody by deputies. He was then taken to the hospital with injuries described as not life-threatening.\nThe sheriff's office said he faces charges of fleeing and eluding, driving with a suspended license, petit theft, failure to register a motor vehicle, aggravated fleeing and eluding, and breaking and entering parole violation.\nNone of the work crews or other drivers were injured during the incident.\nIt's perhaps a happy ending to a chase at a time when high-speed police pursuits are a hot topic on the Treasure Coast.\nIn the past year, three high-speed police responses led to the deaths of innocent bystanders.\nThe most recent happened in Stuart last week when a fleeing suspect led a Stuart police officer on a pursuit on U.S. Highway 1. The suspect hit a MARTY Bus, which slammed into another car and killed an innocent driver.\nPolice Chief Joseph Tuminelli told WPTV the officer, so far, appears to have been following protocol, but sat down with Hussey on Tuesday to talk about whether police pursuits are always necessary or appropriate.\n\"This [latest incident] kind of highlights how, when we follow our pursuit policies, that doesn't mean these criminals are just shutting it down also,\" Budensiek said.\n\"And had your deputies not re-engaged, this could have been a different scenario,\" Hussey said.\n\"They're still running at 100 plus mph through our county, continuing to endanger our community,\" agreed Budensiek.\nBudensiek said it's a tough balance to strike, deciding whether or not to pursue a fleeing suspect.\nHe said while police pursuits often end badly, and always have, with more growth on the Treasure Coast, comes more cars on the road and more opportunity for an innocent bystander to get caught in the crosshairs of a car chase.\nHowever, he said letting a fleeing suspect go often isn't the right option either.\n\"Our No. 1 goal is public safety, however, that looks,\" Budensiek said. \"We have seen that not pursuing suspects only creates more people running here in the county.\"\n\"Is it safe to say you guys are looking at alternate methods of striking that balance, like your aviation unit?\" Hussey asked.\n\"We have to strike a balance. We can't just let these guys run from us all the time, but we're also going to be extremely thoughtful in how we catch them,\" Budensiek said. \"We've had enough bad outcomes where we're constantly reminded that this could happen here in Martin County to one of our citizens, one of our family members.\"\nBudensiek said some of the alternatives the agency is looking at include pursuing with aviation units instead of with patrol cars. He also said using trucks to block the paths of fleeing vehicles is another alternative the agency is now utilizing.\nTuminelli told Hussey on Tuesday his department is also looking at potentially utilizing Stop Sticks in the future.",
