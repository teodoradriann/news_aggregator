    "title": "Stop Gain-of-Function Research. Now. - The Kennedy Beacon",
    "text": "By Dick Russell, Special to The Kennedy Beacon\nThe mainstream media is spinning a coming “bird flu” pandemic but what they ought to be writing about is how urgently we should stop Gain-of-Function research.\nAs Clayton Baker recently wrote in a Brownstone Institute article titled, “Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook”: “…. As is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called ‘public health’ and ‘pandemic preparedness’ ‘experts’ – are actually the ones who created the problem.”\nhttps://x.com/avpac_us/status/1892050443225682018?s=46\nIn December, a study concerning bird flu viruses circulating in cows discovered that a single mutation could trigger something much more capable of attacking the human upper respiratory tract. And mutations are precisely what Gain-of-Function (GOF) experiments are designed to make happen — a laboratory-induced genetic change that intentionally modifies a virus or a pathogen to express itself abnormally or take on a whole new purpose. For example, some GOF research is intended to develop bioweapons that manifest in the form of deadly viruses.\nBut the stated scientific goal is to better understand how viruses and pathogens interact with people, leading to development of medical countermeasures.\nThis is the kind of research the NIH was funding through an intermediary, EcoHealth Alliance, at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. Which is where the Department of Energy, the FBI and the CIA now have stated the same hypothesis, that COVID-19 somehow escaped from the Chinese lab and went on to infect people across much of the globe. This is contrary to the longstanding insistence of Dr. Fauci and his associates that the coronavirus originated in bats circling the Wuhan wet market, not the adjacent laboratory.\nWhatever happened that ended up killing millions (while earning billions for Moderna, Pfizer and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with their genetically-modified mRNA vaccines), controversy over GOF research didn’t go away. It’s worth remembering that, back in 2011, two separate animal studies appeared about the dangerous avian H5N1 virus being modified to spread between ferrets. These were conducted far from China – in Madison, Wisconsin and Rotterdam, Holland – but concerns arose over whether publication of the results could be utilized by bioterrorists. Eventually publication went ahead, but in 2014 a series of accidents in federal biocontainment labs prompted the Obama administration to announce a pause on federal funding for eighteen GOF studies involving influenza.\nTwo National Academy of Science workshops ensued to analyze the risks and benefits of the experiments and, in 2017, the NIH decided to lift the moratorium. As COVID loomed on the horizon, some of the GOF research was quietly allowed to start up again under a revised federal oversight process, which soon came under fire for keeping its details secret.\n“We are now being asked,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, “to trust a completely opaque process where the outcome is to permit the continuation of dangerous experiments.” He wasn’t alone. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, added; “Details regarding the decision to approve and fund this work should be made transparent.” Rutgers University microbiologist Richard Ebright called the lack of openness “disturbing and indefensible” and wondered why safer alternative methods hadn’t been considered.\nInside the same Midwestern lab that first sparked the debate, NIH-funded GOF studies on the bird flu virus resumed in earnest. These occurred within an enhanced biosafety level-3 enclosure at the University of Wisconsin’s Influenza Research Institute. In one experiment, lead virologist Yoshiro Kawaoka reportedly mixed the bird flu strain with the Spanish flu virus that killed millions after World War One; the experiment resulted in a respiratory virus with human transmission capability.\nAs before, ferrets were pulled out of their cages and exposed to a lab-engineered viral strain. And then an accident occurred. A l engthy article in USA Today by investigative reporter Alison Young recorded how an air-purifying regulator had somehow disconnected from a unit supplying safe, filtered air. Suddenly the detached hose was dangling loose in the lab’s possibly contaminated air. Yet the university chose not to notify public health officials about the incident or consult about discontinuing a quarantine on an affected trainee. They simply claimed that no real exposure had taken place.\nIn 2022, Dr. Robert Redfield , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during President Trump’s first term, warned in an interview: “I believe the great pandemic is still in the future, and that’s going to be a bird flu pandemic for man. It’s going to have significant mortality in the 10 to 50% range.”\nAs if that wasn’t scary enough, Redfield went on to make a direct accusation that COVID-19 emanated not out of a lab in Wuhan but from one at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. China’s “accountability is not following the international health regulations after they realized they had a problem,” Redfield said, adding that “there is a real possibility that the virus’s birthplace was the GOF research lab run in North Carolina by Dr. Ralph Baric.” It’s noteworthy that Baric’s work was not banned by the moratorium imposed in 2014.\nAt a congressional hearing, Senator Rand Paul (R-TN) also pointed the finger at Baric, citing the scientist’s collaboration with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Virology Institute, “sharing his discoveries about how to create super-viruses.” The senator added, “This gain-of-function research has been funded by the NIH.”\nBy then, where the virus came from had become highly politicized, which wasn’t helped by Dr. Anthony Fauci’s obfuscation in an email trail released under the Freedom-of-Information Act [FOIA]. This January, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal , FBI Senior Scientist Jason Bannan revealed that the Bureau had been intentionally excluded from an August 24, 2021 briefing of President Biden, where only proponents of the animal origin theory were invited. Senator Ron Johnson recently issued a subpoena demanding Fauci’s emails and other documents that the Biden administration had illegally redacted and withheld.\nAs RFK Jr. wrote in the opening chapter to his 2023 book, The Wuhan Cover-Up : “ As the world now knows, Dr. Fauci sought through his gain-of-function experiments to deliberately develop highly virulent, easily transmissible coronavirus pathogens purposely souped-up to be capable of causing a global pandemic. Dr. Fauci justifies his long fascination with these perilous conjurations as useful for anticipating and improving pandemic preparedness, and for developing preemptive vaccines for animal viruses before they jump to humans. Yet, if that’s truly the case, how is it that we were still so woefully unprepared when a pandemic hit?”\nMarc Lipsitch , of Harvard, says that altering viruses to make them more dangerous, even in a highly controlled lab setting, doesn’t produce results as significant as suggested by advocates. A mutated virus created in a lab won’t necessarily match how it mutates in the wild. The risks of GOF research simply aren’t worth the potential gains, Lipsitch strongly believes; scientists and health officials should stay focused on “basic epidemiology and veterinary questions.” What animals were infected, which people were exposed, who became infected and how sick did they get? “I can’t think of any route by which gain-of-function studies could have informed, much less answered these questions,” Lipsitch said in January.\nRenowned cardiologist and NIH critic, Dr. Peter McCullough, has called for a shutdown of all GOF labs while warning that animal culling and bird flu vaccines would only create “more resistant strains.”\nWhen RFK Jr. was still running for president as an independent in 2024, he posted on X: “24 different pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop a bird flu vaccine – for cows! How many more are working on a bird flu vaccine for humans? Moderna’s stock price has gone up 40% since bird flu moved into cows. The company is worth over $20 million more than it was 3 months ago. The market knows that the government plans to use mRNA vaccines for emerging infections, regardless of whether the public wants them.”\nSoon after his inauguration in January, Trump was reported to be preparing an executive order curtailing GOF funding. In my view, that makes a lot more sense when it comes to public health than making drastic cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that 160 million Americans rely upon. Thankfully, this week, Trump stated that those programs, and Social Security, won’t be touched.\nIn May of 2024, after four years of evasion, NIH deputy director Lawrence Tabak admitted to Congress that, in the months and years before the COVID-19 pandemic, American taxpayers had funded GOF research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the Government Accountability Office, the NIH and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) provided more than $2.1 million in grant funding to three Chinese research labs that included GOF experiments with coronaviruses between 2014 and 2021.\nAnd that was the tip of the iceberg. Ralph Baric, leading light in GOF science, had received more than 150 NIH grants prior to the pandemic. His colleague, Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, received millions more from U.S. military, intelligence and health agencies to fund bioweapons-related research in Wuhan.\nIf we’re going to have a tax rebellion like our forefathers did, let’s make it about those GOF gadflies. As Kennedy ended his 2024 post on X: “We need to stop playing with fire. My administration will shut down the gain-of-function labs on day 1, while we figure out what they are doing. We will end these lab-grown plagues for good.”\nIn the Trump administration, he is now in a position to do just that.\nDick Russell is the author of the authorized biography The Real RFK Jr: Trials of a Truth Warrior.

    "title": "Student scholars bring home 20 medals from Yale tournament",
    "text": "by Andrew Alonzo | [aalonzo@claremont-courier.com](mailto:aalonzo@claremont-courier.com) El Roble Intermediate School students Marjorie Barndt and Thijmen Post, and Elite Sports Institute’s Mary Jane Erb returned from last month’s 2024 World Scholar’s Cup Tournament of Champions at Yale University with a combined 20 individual and team medals. Yale International Relations Association hosted the event in New Haven, Connecticut November 14-20, with hundreds of teams from around the world competing in a challenging mix of academic and artistic competitions. The Claremont trio, known as “team 568,” came in 8th in the top CanZuk USA teams division, 64th in scholar’s bowl, 162nd in debate, and 196th in writing. Marjorie took gold in the scholar’s challenge, art, literature, and special area categories. Mary Jane won gold in debate and writing, and silver in literature. Thijmen brought home silver in debate. “It was really great to be there,” Thijmen said of the experience. “I really didn’t expect we would place so high in the North American division.” The team finished eighth at the World Scholar’s Cup’s global round in Stockholm, which earned it a trip to the Tournament of Champions at Yale. At the Los Angeles regionals in April, a team made of Marjorie, Mary Jane and Charlie Rapp of El Roble finished sixth, and Thijmen, with Alaina Casillas of El Roble and Andrew Casillas of Condit Elementary, finished 15th. Full results from both competitions are at scholarscup.org/results . The Yale tournament will be the last in the junior division for Marjorie and Mary Jane, who will both be 14 by the time the next competition rolls around. Thijmen will be 13, and will remain eligible. “The big problem for Marjorie and MJ is that they will have to compete against the juggernaut La Salle students who just finished 10th in the world,” wrote John Erb, an English teacher and academic decathlon coach at La Salle College Preparatory , in an email Wednesday. “The good news is that they share the same resources and have the same coach.” 0 Comments Submit a Comment [Cancel reply](/latest-news/student-scholars-bring-home-20-medals-from-yale-tournament-80957/#respond) You must be logged in to post a comment.",

    "title": "La 'Marea Verde' del Araski invade Mendizorroza",
    "text": "Después de estar casi cuatro meses sin el mejor baloncesto, la afición del Kutxabank Araski demostró este jueves que ya tienen muchas ganas de que una nueva temporada comience. Algo que sucederá dentro de poco, y es que el conjunto dirigido por Madelén Urieta comenzará su andadura en la élite del baloncesto femenino nacional el primer fin de semana de octubre, en la que será su novena temporada en la Liga Femenina Endesa. Su estreno oficial en Mendizorroza se vivirá siete días después cuando el Zaragoza visite el templo araskizale y cuando por fin la Marea Verde y el equipo se vuelvan a encontrar 5 meses después.\nEsta iniciativa innovadora del club verde permitió que la afición vitoriana pudiera vivir en primera persona un entrenamiento de sus ídolos. Desde un principio se pudo palpar esa buena conexión que existe entre equipo y aficionados. Aunque las puertas se abrieron a las 18:20 horas, minutos antes los gasteiztarras ya esperaban formando colas para poder entrar lo antes posible. Esta acción pudo demostrar una vez más la pasión que vive Vitoria por el baloncesto femenino y su poder de atracción, el cual es mayor a cada temporada que transcurre.\nUna vez dentro, los aficionados demostraron sus ganas por conocer a los nuevos fichajes, es decir, a Bethy Mununga, Natalia Rodríguez, Maxuella Lisowa-Mbaka y Montse Brotons. El buen ambiente no tardó en palparse y, como si de un partido se tratara, los aficionados rápidamente empezaron a animar a las suyas. En cuanto terminó el entrenamiento, el speaker presentó de forma oficial a la plantilla ante la ovación de la grada e incluso Made y Hermida tuvieron unas palabras para emocionar a los presentes. Es más, la entrenadora ya avisó de que “este año nos vamos a divertir en Mendizorroza”.\nNUEVAS CARAS Y TAMBIÉN VETERANAS\nLas nuevas incorporaciones respondieron con cariño y cercanía a ese entusiasmo de los aficionados y en todo momento se prestaron para sacarse fotos y firmar autógrafos. Algo que se pudo llevar a cabo después del entrenamiento. “A pesar de que ya nos habían avisado del buen ambiente de la afición y de su entusiasmo, hasta que no lo vives, no ves lo especial que es”, ese fue el comentario más escuchado entre las nuevas jugadoras del equipo. Mientras que las veteranas también admitieron que cinco meses sin la Marea Verde es demasiado.\nLógicamente, las veteranas como Hermida, Hill, Van den Adel, Aliaga o Brewer fueron foco del gran cariño de las araskizales, en especial, de las más pequeñas que sueñan con llegar algún día a dónde están sus ídolos. La sesión se alargó en el tiempo y es que los aficionados quisieron aprovechar este momento para exprimirlo al máximo, y es que muchos de ellos comentaron que “este mes que resta para que empiece la temporada de forma oficial se puede hacer muy largo”. Por ejemplo, Carlos García comentó entre risas que espera que “las veteranas hayan enseñado bien a las nuevas el baile y la canción de la victoria, porque este año tiene pinta que va a sonar muchas veces en Mendizorroza”.\nEso sí, también hubo cautela entre las gradas y muestra de ello fue Janire Sainz que comentó que “aunque el equipo tiene buena pinta, la liga va a ser muy dura, pero de momento se ve que hay muy buena conexión dentro del equipo y eso es buena señal”. Un mítico que no faltó a esta cita fue Iñaki Larrea, Lagartijo, quien gracias a su ama, una fiel seguidora del club gasteiztarra y que no pudo estar por motivos de salud, sigue los pasos del Araski desde sus comienzos.\nAdemás, el legado no queda ahí, ya que la nieta también juega en las categorías inferiores del club. El músico en todo momento agradeció a su ama que desde un principio le inculcó su pasión por el baloncesto y comentó, “mi hija y mi familia siempre apoyaremos al Araski y al baloncesto en Vitoria”. Respecto al equipo, el vitoriano añadió que “los fichajes tienen muy buena pinta y si las veteranas dan ese paso al frente tras su periodo de adaptación del año pasado, el equipo puede hacer muy buena temporada”.\nLo que está claro es que rinda mejor o peor el equipo, o se consigan objetivos mayores o peores, la buena conexión entre la plantilla y afición estará asegurada en esta novena temporada en la élite.",

    "title": "Alex Lifeson on the most underrated guitarist of all time",
    "text": "Alex Lifeson on the most underrated guitarist of all time: “He has such an amazing ability” There will always be a handful of musicians that never get the recognition they deserve. Even when bands like The Velvet Underground get their just due in the press and among the public, it’s usually long after they have stopped making music, leading to many people seeing their brilliance in hindsight. Although Rush may have been able to stick around to see their legacy solidified, [Alex Lifeson](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/tags/alex-lifeson/) admitted that one guitarist was one of the unsung heroes of rock and roll. Then again, Lifeson already had a few underappreciated gems in his catalogue before Rush received widespread acclaim. Across the band’s prog-rock epics, Lifeson had a way of combining hard rock fury with the mathematical precision of the band, almost sounding like Jimmy Page if he were asked to play with King Crimson. Across the band’s various eras, Lifeson would also be seen incorporating new sounds into his sonic arsenal. As the band experimented with various keyboard sounds, Lifeson made it a habit to keep his own synthesisers working, creating sonic landscapes [with various effects pedals on albums like Hold Your Fire and Power Windows](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-period-of-rush-that-alex-lifeson-hated-most/). While Lifeson was twisting what a rock and roll guitar player could do, Steve Morse was already creating his own voice on the guitar. Arriving on the scene as a member of Dixie Dregs, Morse would be out with his solo band when opening for Rush, where he astounded Lifeson from the moment he heard him. When discussing his favourite players, Lifeson would consider Morse one of the most overlooked players he had ever heard, telling [Music Radar](https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/40-guitarists-on-their-favourite-players-583475), “He has such an amazing ability. I always thought that he should have been huge in whatever he did. He was definitely successful in whatever bands he worked in, but I don’t think that he ever had the kind of recognition that he so deserved”. Even though Morse could play circles around most of the aspiring guitar players on the scene, his most high-profile gigs came when performing with Deep Purple. After Ritchie Blackmore departed the band for the second time and Joe Satriani filled in on one tour, Morse was brought in as the replacement and has remained a fixture of the band’s sound for decades, laying down some fantastic licks on albums like 2013’s Now What???. When listening to his guitar solos, it’s easy to see where Lifeson is coming from. Regardless of which genre he finds himself playing in, Morse knows how to find his lane as a guitar player, either slipping in a nice piece of ear candy to compliment the vocals or going off the rails by playing a monster riff. Considering where Lifeson took his guitar playing in the back half of Rush’s career, he may have stolen a few tricks from Morse, keeping the audience on their toes across albums like Clockwork Angels and Snakes and Arrows. While many guitarists have a habit of not evolving over the years, Morse helped remind Lifeson that there is always room for improvement at every turn.",

    "text": "Боец с позывным Камчатка: продавцы завышают цены для солдат в зоне СВО\n- 19 июня 2025 07:03\n-\nДенис Светлов\nПо сообщениям, поступившим от участников специальной военной операции (СВО), продавцы продуктов и обмундирования в зоне конфликта искусственно завышают цены для российских военнослужащих. Эту информацию рассказали бойцы, участвующие в действиях. Военнослужащий, выступающий под позывным Камчатка, отметил, что местные торговцы на рынках и в небольших магазинах зоны СВО часто избегают указания ценников и назначают разные цены для покупателей в гражданской и военной одежде, передает «Лента.ру».\nКак пояснил Камчатка, встречаются случаи, когда килограмм помидоров стоит 100 рублей для тех, кто приходит в обычной одежде, а для военнослужащих цена увеличивается до 300-350 рублей. Это поведение наблюдается преимущественно у частных торговцев и связано, по его мнению, с желанием получить дополнительную прибыль.\nДругой военнослужащий, назвавший себя Каспер, подчеркнул, что наценки распространяются даже на военное обмундирование, которое в условиях СВО быстро изнашивается. Он отметил существование передвижных торговых точек, где форма стоит 10 тысяч рублей, тогда как в других частях России её цена составляет около 4500 рублей, то есть вдвое дешевле.\nТакже боец с позывным Бист указал, что зона СВО привлекает неопытных бизнесменов, стремящихся к лёгкой наживе. Он подчеркнул, что на всякие товары в зоне конфликта делают накрутку в 50 процентов, и добавил, что это место активно используется теми, кто не способен добиться успеха в бизнесе в обычных условиях.\n-\nТелеграм -\nДзен - Подписывайтесь на наши каналы и первыми узнавайте о главных новостях и важнейших событиях дня.",

    "title": "Le gouvernement israélien rejette les propositions de cessez-le-feu dans le cadre de l’escalade du conflit avec le Liban",
    "text": "Principaux renseignements\n- Le gouvernement israélien a rejeté une proposition de cessez-le-feu de 21 jours au Liban, présentée par les États-Unis et la France.\n- Les forces israéliennes ont lancé de nouvelles frappes aériennes visant les positions du Hezbollah au Liban, malgré l’absence de réponse officielle du bureau de M. Netanyahu.\n- Israël se prépare à une éventuelle opération terrestre au Liban, avec le déploiement de deux brigades de réserve supplémentaires dans la région nord.\nLe gouvernement israélien rejette les propositions de cessez-le-feu\nLe ministre israélien des Affaires étrangères, Israël Katz, a fermement rejeté les propositions de cessez-le-feu de 21 jours au Liban, présentées par les États-Unis et la France. M. Katz a déclaré son intention de continuer à combattre le Hezbollah avec toutes les forces disponibles jusqu’à ce que la victoire soit acquise et que les habitants du nord d’\nIsraël puissent rentrer chez eux en toute sécurité. Pendant ce temps, le Premier ministre Benjamin Netanyahu, qui était en route pour s’adresser aux Nations Unies, a indiqué qu’il n’avait pas encore répondu à la proposition de cessez-le-feu, mais a ordonné à l’armée de poursuivre ses opérations avec toutes ses forces, conformément aux plans établis.\nEscalade du conflit au Liban\nMalgré l’absence de réponse officielle du bureau de M. Netanyahu, les forces israéliennes ont rapidement lancé une nouvelle série de frappes aériennes visant les positions du Hezbollah au Liban. Le ministre des finances, Bezalel Smotrich, chef de l’une des factions religieuses nationalistes d’Israël, a insisté sur l’annihilation complète du Hezbollah, arguant que seule sa reddition permettrait le retour en toute sécurité des résidents déplacés.\nIl a insisté sur la nécessité d’empêcher l’ennemi de se rétablir et de se réorganiser après une éventuelle période de cessez-le-feu de 21 jours. La faction d’extrême droite du ministre de la sécurité nationale, Itamar Ben-Gvir, a également exprimé son opposition à la proposition de cessez-le-feu, ses membres ayant déjà condamné l’idée avant une réunion d’urgence prévue jeudi.\nContexte du conflit\nLe conflit s’est intensifié la semaine dernière lorsqu’Israël a lancé sa campagne aérienne la plus lourde contre le Liban depuis la guerre de 2006, entraînant la mort de plus de 600 personnes. Cette action fait suite à des mois de tirs transfrontaliers entre Israël et le Hezbollah, un mouvement soutenu par l’Iran, qui ont fait monter la tension au point de frôler la guerre totale. Le Hezbollah a riposté en tirant des centaines de missiles sur des cibles en Israël, y compris Tel Aviv, bien que le système de défense aérienne d’Israël ait minimisé les dommages.\nPréparations en vue d’une éventuelle opération terrestre\nMercredi, le chef de l’armée israélienne a fait des commentaires publics sur une éventuelle opération terrestre au Liban, demandant aux troupes situées près de la frontière de se préparer à la traverser. On ne sait toujours pas s’il s’agit d’une véritable indication d’un assaut terrestre imminent ou d’une tactique stratégique visant à faire pression sur le Hezbollah pour qu’il fasse des concessions. Pour se préparer, Israël a déployé mercredi deux brigades de réserve supplémentaires dans la région nord.\nOrigines du conflit\nLe conflit\nactuel découle de près d’un an d’échanges de tirs intermittents entre Israël et le Hezbollah, initiés par le Hezbollah à la suite de l’attaque du Hamas contre des communautés israéliennes dans le sud d’Israël le 7 octobre.

    "text": "Nigeria, strage di cristiani a Natale: 170 morti trucidati/ “La guerra dei Fulani islamisti contro Gesù” La strage di Natale in Ngeria: 170 cristiani uccisi e trucidati, ma il bilancio dell vittime rischia di salire. La testimonianza di Padre Dewan all'ACS: “guerra religiosa dei Fulani\" STRAGE DI CRISTIANI A NATALE: 170 MORTI, UCCISI DAI PASTORI FULANI [170 persone uccise, trucidate, nei giorni del Natale per il solo fatto di essere cristiani](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/160-cristiani-uccisi-in-nigeria-una-strage-dellislam-fondamentalista-in-un-paese-nel-caos/2638894/): arriva dalla [Nigeria l’ultimo indecente attentato contro le popolazioni cristiani in Africa](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/nigeria-seminarista-bruciato-vivo-un-altro-rapito-cristiani-perseguitati-in-africa-acs-liberate-nuhu/2587430/), in quella già ribattezzata come “la strage di Natale”. 170 cristiani uccisi dai pastori Fulani – etnia nomade di stampo islamista jihadista – tra il 23 e il 26 dicembre a Bokkos, nello Stato di Plateau, in Nigeria: secondo le poche informazioni emerse dalle autorità locali, e grazie invece alla preziosa testimonianza della fondazione pontificia Aiuto alla Chiesa che Soffre (ACS) emerge come gli aggressori sarebbero un migliaio di Fulani che nei giorni del Natale hanno preso di mira le comunità cristiane a Bokkos, non toccando invece le comunità musulmane che pure vivono fianco a fianco in un difficile ma comunque esistente dialogo tra religioni diverse. 170 è il bilancio purtroppo solo parziale delle vittime ritrovate nei villaggi nigeriani ma il numero dei morti è destinato a salire nelle prossime ore: come spiega l’AGI, molti sfollati hanno cercato rifugio nelle chiese, «con le organizzazioni religiose che hanno fornito assistenza primaria, data l’assenza di sostegno da parte del governo». Sono state attaccate ben 26 comunità, la maggiorparte appunto a Bokkos ma anche in altre zone come Mangu e Barkin Ladi sempre nello Stato di Plateau. Dal 1999 lo scontro con i pastori Fulani è purtroppo all’ordine del giorno e sotto la guida dell’ex presidente nigeriano Muhammadu Buhari si è diffusa purtroppo una “tolleranza” nei Fulani jihadisti: a pagarne le spese sempre i cristiani che pure vivono da secoli in quell’area. Dai [preti rapiti e uccisi alle comunità colpite](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/in-nigeria-aumentano-i-sacerdoti-rapiti-larcivescovo-governo-non-sa-difenderci/2558285/), dalle discriminazioni statali contro le persone non musulmane ad autentiche stragi come quelle a Natale: da anni ormai [la Nigeria (e non solo con la jihad di Boko Haram) è uno dei Paesi al mondo dove è più pericoloso semplicemente testimoniare la propria fede in Gesù.](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/cristiani-perseguitati-nigeria-7600-morti-e-5200-sequestri-una-domande-ai-cristiani-di-occidente/2553616/) PADRE DEWAN (DIOCESI PANKSHIN): “LA STRAGE DI NATALE È UNA GUERRA RELIGIOSA, NON HANNO ATTACCATO I MUSULMANI MA SOLO NOI CRISTIANI” Preziosa [la testimonianza sulla strage di Natale in Nigeria di Padre Andrew Dewan, Direttore delle comunicazioni della Diocesi di Pankshin](https://acs-italia.org/acs-notizie-dal-mondo/in-nigeria-strage-di-cristiani-a-natale), nel cui territorio si sono verificati gli attacchi: dialogando con ACS il sacerdote è ancora sotto choc per i 170 cristiani uccisi in pochissime ore, «ma il numero è destinato ad aumentare, perché ci sono ancora molte persone negli ospedali, con lesioni e ferite di diverso grado». Padre Dewan vive in quelle comunità da anni e conferma che nelle zone degli attacchi «le vittime sono cristiane al 100%, tranne alcuni. Questa violenza è iniziata di notte in una comunità rurale chiamata Mushu. 18 persone sono state uccise e molte altre sono rimaste ferite». Dopo i primi attacchi, i terroristi Fulani si sono spostati con pratiche sommarie di esecuzioni: «Le persone sono state uccise sommariamente, le case e il mais raccolto sono stati dati alle fiamme, anche le chiese e le cliniche sono state date alle fiamme. Quella mattina ero andato in quella stessa comunità per la Messa di Natale per la comunità cattolica. Da Tudun Mazat, i terroristi Fulani sono scesi a Maiyanga, uccidendo tredici persone. Nella notte sono state attaccate circa altre 20 comunità», racconta ancora il sacerdote alla fondazione del Vaticano. I sopravvissuti e i testimoni oculari sono stati categorici nel dire che si tratta chiaramente di miliziani Fulani: nelle comunità in cui i cristiani vivono fianco a fianco con i Fulani, racconta padre Dewan, «nessuna persona Fulani è stata colpita e nessuna casa Fulani è stata bruciata, quindi non c’è dubbio che gli aggressori fossero Fulani». ACS: “È UNA GUERRA RELIGIOSA. I MARTIRI SIANO SEME PER NUOVI CRISTIANI” Il “movente” della strage di Natale è molteplice tra politico e religioso, prova a spiegare il sacerdote: «potrebbe essere collegato agli attacchi avvenuti nella vicina amministrazione locale, Mangu. I Fulani lì hanno attaccato le comunità, e si aspettavano che i cristiani di Bokkos, in particolare le comunità al confine con Mangu, permettessero loro l’accesso, ma questi hanno rifiutato. Quindi, penso che siano tornati ad attaccare le comunità per questo motivo». Resta però chiara la matrice anti-cristiana della strage di Natale in Nigeria contro cui lo Stato non sta muovendo un dito: «Per coloro che credono che questo conflitto non sia religioso, quest’ultimo attacco dimostra che si tratta chiaramente di un conflitto religioso. Il fatto che abbia avuto luogo a Natale e che i cristiani siano stati deliberatamente presi di mira in una comunità mista, in cui i musulmani non vengono attaccati, manifesta chiaramente le caratteristiche di un conflitto religioso. So che non tutti vorrebbero ammetterlo, ma per me, che sono stato sul campo, ho osservato e scritto al riguardo, vi sono i segni di un conflitto religioso». Come ha ricordato [Papa Francesco nell’Angelus della festa di Santo Stefano Protomartire](https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/angelus-santo-stefano-2023-con-papa-francesco-diretta-video-il-protomartire-e-il-perdono-cristiano/2637393/), «il sangue dei martiri è seme per i cristiani. Nei peggiori momenti dove tutto sembra perduto, quel seme agisce ancora»: e così sottolinea anche il Presidente esecutivo di ACS, Regina Lynch: «chiediamo al governo della Nigeria di affrontare finalmente questo problema e di garantire sicurezza ai suoi cittadini, ed esortiamo i nostri amici e benefattori a continuare a pregare per la Nigeria, proprio come noi ci impegniamo a continuare ad aiutare in ogni modo possibile». I cristiani uccisi in Nigeria, e in altri Paesi del mondo, «sono i “Santi Innocenti” del XXI Secolo. Il sangue versato come seguaci di Gesù sarà, ne siamo certi, il seme di nuovi cristiani». © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "There are strong indications that the planned December 1 strike called by the Nigeria Labour Congress may suffer a setback following the declaration by some state chapters of the union that they will not be part of the proposed industrial action.\nPresident Bola Tinubu had in July approved a new minimum wage of N70,000 for Nigerian workers, including civil servants, and pledged to review the wage every three years.\nMany states agreed to pay above the N70,000 minimum wage, with Lagos and Rivers states offering the highest pay of N85,000.\nHowever, 14 states and the Federal Capital Territory have yet to begin the implementation of the new minimum wage.\nSome of the affected states include Abia, Akwa Ibom, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Imo, Nasarawa, Kaduna, and Katsina.\nOthers are Oyo, Cross River, Sokoto, Yobe, Zamfara, Enugu states, and the FCT.\nBut less than 24 hours to the planned strike, some state chapters of the NLC withdrew and distanced themselves from the industrial action.\nImo\nIn Imo State, the NLC Chairman, Uche Chigaemezu, said on Saturday that there was no plan to embark on any strike.\nSpeaking in an interview with Sunday PUNCH, Chigaemezu said, “We cannot think of embarking on any strike because we have reached an agreement with the state government led by Governor Hope Uzodimma.\n“He has shown commitment to the payment of N70,000 minimum wage to Imo workers. We have communicated our position to the national body, and they are aware of the decision of the government to pay the minimum wage soon.”\nA civil servant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that there was no plan to embark on strike in the state.\nSokoto\nIn Sokoto State, following the approval of N70,000 minimum wage for state workers by Governor Ahmed Aliyu, the NLC opted out of the planned national strike of the union.\nRecall that the state governor, while presenting the 2025 appropriation bill to the state House of Assembly on Friday, announced that his administration was ready to adopt N70,000 as the new minimum wage.\nThe governor, however, disclosed that the implementation of the new wage would commence in January 2025.\nSpeaking with our correspondent on the next line of action, the secretary of the NLC in the state, on Saturday, said the union had withdrawn from the proposed strike action.\nHe said, “We are not joining the strike action; representatives of the labour union and the state government have signed a memorandum of understanding on the implementation of the new minimum wage.”\nOyo\nSimilarly, organised labour in Oyo State dissociated itself from the strike.\nThe NLC state chairman and his Trade Union Congress counterpart, Kayode Martins and Bosun Olabiyi, respectively, in separate interviews with Sunday PUNCH in Ibadan, the state capital, said labour would not participate in the strike.\nMartins said, “We have liaised with the national secretariat, and we let them realise the stage we are. Already, we have Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for the conclusion of everything.\n“We wrote in our press release that we have a good rapport with the government.”\nIn his submission, Olabiyi said, “We are dissociating ourselves totally from the strike in the state. We have an understanding with the state government; we are not going on strike because everything is fine in this state.”\nKatsina\nThe NLC Chairman in Katsina State, Hussaini Danduna, was also part of the withdrawal spree, saying workers in the state would not join the planned December 1st industrial action.\nHe said, “We have signed an agreement with the Katsina State Government, and based on this, we are not going to join the strike action declared by the national executive council of our union.”\nAlso, the TUC Chairman, Katsina State chapter, Mukhtar Abdu-Ruma, said workers would not join the action following the agreement reached with the state government on Saturday.\n“The new minimum wage will be implemented in December, and we have agreed on the minimum wage and consequential adjustment,” he stated.\nAkwa Ibom\nMeanwhile, the TUC Chairman in Akwa Ibom State, Dominic Abang, said public civil servants would not participate in the planned industrial action by the NLC over the non-implementation of the new minimum wage.\nThough the state NLC Chairman, Sunny James, could not be reached on the phone, Abang told one of our correspondents in Uyo, the state capital, that the TUC had gone far at the committee level, hence there was no need to join the strike.\nKaduna, Nasarawa, Zamfara, FCT confirm participation\nThe Kaduna State chapter of the NLC on Saturday confirmed its participation in the planned nationwide strike scheduled for December 1, 2024.\nThe Chairman of the Kaduna State NLC, Ayuba Suleiman, confirmed the state’s participation to Sunday PUNCH on Saturday.\nWhen asked if the NLC was prepared to embark on the nationwide strike, Suleiman replied, “Yes, we are set for the strike.”\nSimilarly, the Nasarawa State chapter of the NLC declared its readiness to comply with the nationwide strike order.\nThe state NLC Chairman, Ismaila Okoh, said a notice of strike had been issued to all its members to drive home their demands on the implementation of the new national minimum wage.\nAlso, the FCT council of the NLC directed workers in the six area councils of the FCT to embark on an indefinite strike on December 1 until further directives were issued.\nThis was contained in a letter obtained by our correspondent, which was signed by the Chairman of the FCT Council of the NLC, Stephen Knabayi.\nIn his letter, organised labour in the territory faulted the failure of the area council chairmen to respond to the demand for the implementation of the N70,000 minimum wage, despite receiving a communiqué of the National Executive Council of the NLC.\nHe added that the non-implementation of the minimum wage was a “gross violation of the law” and represented total disregard for the welfare of workers in the area councils.\nThe FCT Council Chairman said the State Administrative Council resolved to comply with the national directive, noting also the delay in paying workers’ entitlements in the FCT, including the outstanding arrears of primary school teachers in the respective area councils.\nSpeaking to Sunday PUNCH, the Zamfara State NLC Secretary, Ahmed Abubakar, said workers in the state had yet to receive the new minimum wage, and as such had no alternative but to join the strike.\nHe said, “We are going to join the strike as directed by the national body of our great union to express our anger over the non-payment of the new minimum wage.”\nAbubakar, however, explained that the union would continue to dialogue with the state government on the issue.\nAbia indifferent\nIn Abia, the state chapter the NLC has yet to decide whether to join the strike.\nAll efforts to confirm the Abia NLC’s position on the matter from the state Chairman, Ogbonnaya Okoro, proved abortive as several calls and messages to him remained unanswered.\nWhen contacted, the state Secretary of the NLC, Emma Alozie, said, “I wouldn’t know yet. We have been engaging the government on the new minimum wage.”\nNLC dismisses excuses\nHowever, the NLC has dismissed the excuses given by some state chapters not to embark on the strike as directed by the national leadership of the union, emphasising that the welfare of workers must take precedence.\nSpeaking with Sunday PUNCH, the NLC National Treasurer, Akeem Ambali, said labour had mobilised its affiliate unions across the country and directed their leadership to prepare their members for industrial action in states yet to implement the new minimum wage.\nAmbali also berated states that had only made verbal commitments without formal agreements or implementation, adding that such states would not be spared from the industrial action.\nHe said, “Labour will embark on strike by midnight of the 30th of this month (November); we have mobilsed for that. We have directed the leadership of all affiliates to mobilise their members for the strike.\n“Even states that only made pronouncements without signing an agreement with labour and have yet to implement the new minimum wage will also experience the strike because we know some of them only made statements.\n“They never paid the new minimum wage. Making a pronouncement without negotiation is not known to labour law; even making a pronouncement without cash backing is not acceptable to labour.\n“Those who have only made empty promises and those who are saying they will start paying by January 2025 will incur the wrath of labour. This is not acceptable to us. There will be a strike in these states by 30th midnight.\n“We are very serious about this. We have had all the organs meeting, and the issue has been decided; there is no going back.”\nThe NLC’s Head of Protocol and Public Relations, Benson Upah, said no amount of persuasion or partial compliance would prevent the industrial action, insisting that only full implementation would avert the looming strike.\nJigawa faces delay, Zamfara, Cross River offer promise\nEarlier, Sunday PUNCH observed that workers in Jigawa State would have to wait till December before receiving the N70,000 minimum wage.\nAlthough the state Governor, Umar Namadi, had approved N70,000 as the new minimum wage for civil servants in the state, Sunday PUNCH gathered that implementation would be delayed till December.\nNamadi pleaded with labour leaders to support his policies aimed at alleviating the suffering of civil servants and the public.\nMeanwhile, Zamfara and Cross River states have yet to reach an agreement with labour on the new minimum wage as the two governments are reportedly still in the negotiation phase with labour unions.\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the Zamfara Governor on Media and Communication, Mustafa Kaura, told Sunday PUNCH that the state government would implement the new wage as soon as negotiations were concluded with the labour leaders.\n“The state government has already set up a committee to work out modalities for the implementation of the new minimum wage of N70,000.\n“The committee has gone far in its assignment, and I am telling you that, as soon as the committee finishes its assignment, Governor Lawal will surely implement the new wage,” Kaura said.\nAlso, the Cross River State Government pledged to pay the new minimum wage as soon as labour reached an agreement with the government.\nThe Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Nsa Gill, said, “The state government has a negotiating team, and they are at work.\n“Though they have yet to reach an agreement, the government is ready to pay the N70,000 new minimum wage if not beyond.”",
