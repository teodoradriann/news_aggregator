    "text": "Brutale aggressione in pieno giorno a Firenze: anziano picchiato, calci e pugni anche quando è a terra\nC’è un video pubblicato oggi dal quotidiano La Nazione che mostra una brutale aggressione subita da un uomo in pieno giorno a Firenze.\nLa vittima è un uomo anziano – si tratterebbe di un pensionato settantenne – che è stato picchiato in una via vicino a piazza Santa Croce. Sono attualmente in corso accertamenti da parte dei carabinieri in merito all’aggressione, che sarebbe avvenuta nel primo pomeriggio di ieri, mercoledì 27 dicembre 2023.\nNelle immagini pubblicate online si vede l’uomo che cammina da solo in una strada nella zona di Santa Croce a Firenze: a un certo punto si gira e torna indietro camminando verso un altro uomo nel frattempo sopraggiunto.\nÈ quest’ultimo che inizia a picchiare l’anziano: lo prende a pugni e a calci, lo scaraventa contro un muro, continua a colpirlo anche questo questo è ormai a terra, senza alcuna possibilità di difendersi. I colpi lo raggiungono anche all’altezza della testa.\nE in seguito al pestaggio si vede l’aggressore che si allontana insieme a un'altra persona mentre la vittima resta stessa sull’asfalto. Dopo un po’ arrivano altre due persone – forse richiamate dalle urla della vittima – che soccorrono l’anziano a terra.\nPoi sul posto sono arrivati anche i sanitari del 118 che hanno trasportato il settantenne in ospedale. Al momento non risulterebbe ancora formalizzata alcuna denuncia su quanto accaduto, per questo i fatti sono ancora oggetto di ricostruzione e non compiutamente noti ai carabinieri.\nStando alle prime informazioni raccolte dal quotidiano, la violenza inaudita sarebbe però scattata dopo un rimprovero. In particolare l’anziano potrebbe essere stato picchiato dopo aver rimproverato una persona che non teneva il suo cane al guinzaglio.\nI militari dell'Arma sono al lavoro per ricostruire con esattezza quanto accaduto a Firenze.",

    "text": "Telangana Congress working president T Jayaprakash Reddy alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was lying even at a holy place like the Sammakka Saralamma festival refusing to accept that it had promised national festival status to the biggest tribal festival in Telangana. Speaking to reporters, he reminded that Union Minister Arjun Munda had promised national festival status during his visit to Medaram two years ago. But now Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy was refusing to accept the fact that such promise was ever made. He said the BJP which depended on religion for its politics was hurting the sentiments of Telangana people. Did Arjun Munda play politics at the festival for political benefit, or is Mr. Kishan Reddy lying as both cannot be truths, he asked. “Such lies are not expected from the Union Ministers,” he said. The Congress working president said the MLC Kavitha’s episode continued with the CBI including her name in the charge sheet. “If she was involved, why did the BJP government spare her all these years? Why are they bringing it up again just before the elections,” he asked. Mr. Reddy claimed that BJP wanted to rake up the sentiment yet again before the elections to help the BRS as it realised that Congress would win majority seats.",

Users on Beta will be moved to the Release Preview Channel. Transitioning to Windows 11 from Windows 10 is still possible. &#x2715 Remove Ads A few months ago, we reported that Windows 10 was getting a beta branch . At the time, this was very good news, as it showed that Microsoft wasn't going to completely throw Windows 10 under the bus just because Windows 11 had begun to take off. However, it seems that the Redmond giant has gone back on itself, as it has now announced that the Windows 10 Beta branch is dead in the water.\nNo Thanks, Keep Reading\nRelated The Windows 11 2024 Update is now available — here's what's new and why it's not Windows 12 The Windows 11 2024 Update will bring a ton of changes to the operating system, including better support for Arm devices.\n16 Windows 10's Beta branch is cut off five months after returning In a post on the Windows Insider blog, the company detailed what's included with the newest Windows 10 Beta build. However, right before it discusses what the patch contains, it comes with some bad news:\n&#x2715 Remove Ads The Beta Channel and Release Preview Channel will receive the same Windows 10 build today just like we’ve been doing since June . However, this will be the last time we release a Windows 10 build to the Beta Channel as we will be shutting down the Beta Channel for Windows 10.\nPeople who are currently on the Windows 10 Beta build will find themselves automatically changed to the Release Preview Channel in due time, and it will become the only testing channel open for Windows 10 moving forward. Microsoft says that anyone who doesn't want to wait around for that long can still move channels manually by going to \" Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program\" and selecting the Release Channel.\n&#x2715 Remove Ads If this has acted as the last straw and you're begrudgingly upgrading to Windows 11 now, don't fret. You can still bring some creature comforts from 10 over to 11. For example, we recently reported on how to get the Windows 10 Action Center on Windows 11 .\nWindows Windows 10 Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Readers like you help support XDA.

    "text": "Fight between rural Louisiana and carbon capture 'not over'\nOpponents to unfettered development of carbon capture secured a couple of wins this time around, with the House Natural Resources Committee passing four bills.\n(The Center Square) — The fight between the rural parishes and the industries supporting carbon capture and sequestration is not over.\nOn Monday, Allen parish approved an ordinance establishing regulations for carbon storage wells.\n\"One of the reasons they (CO2 companies) picked Allen Parish is because we have no ordinances or zoning and we are going to keep getting taken advantage of, but you have to be careful because you don't regulate your locals,\" Roland Hollins, an Allen parish Police Jury member said, as reported by the American Press. \"But I think it's time that we really have to look at some of this stuff.\"\nWhile Allen Parish officials were busy imposing regulations on carbon capture, the Legislature was busy debating the same thing on Wednesday.\nOpponents to unfettered development of carbon capture secured a couple of wins this time around, with the House Natural Resources Committee passing four bills.\nNotably, one functions to compensate landowners more equally when industry uses their land, another eliminates the authority to use eminent domain for the sake of carbon sequestration.\nAfter the House Natural Resources committee rejected seven bills limiting the development of carbon capture and sequestration, one of the last to testify was Mike Nichols, who assured the House Natural Resources Committee that \"this isn't over.\"\nNichols is a constituent of Vernon parish and is part of a group of rural Louisianans and officials concerned with carbon capture and sequestration.\nSeveral coalitions have sprung up opposing carbon capture and sequestration projects in Louisiana, and one is being led and funded by a group of rural parish police juries, public records show.\nKnown as the Louisiana CO2 Alliance, the group is chaired by elected officials from Allen, Vernon, Jefferson Davis and Beauregard parishes — all of whom have committed public dollars to finance the group's activities.\nThe alliance, made up primarily of police jurors and at least one justice of the peace, requires a membership fee in the thousands of dollars.\nAccording to meeting minutes from various parishes, each local government approved expenditures to join the group and support its lobbying efforts.\nJefferson Davis Parish approved an initial payment of $1,450 to join the CO2 Alliance. Allen Parish went further, agreeing to pay lobbyist Savant Strategies an initial $1,450, followed by quarterly payments of $2,475. Savant testified in support of the bills limiting carbon capture and sequestration last week.\nAllen Parish also allocated an additional $6,000 for an environmental risk assessment conducted by the consulting firm Gulf Engineers & Consultants, which prepared a report on the impacts, good and bad, of carbon capture and sequestration.\nBeauregard Parish committed up to $5,000 to support the Alliance. Vernon Parish's records on the matter were not available at the time of publication.\nThe group has been holding the technology's feet to the fire in public hearings at the Legislature and at their own police jury hearings.\nHollins is also the President of the CO2 Alliance and voiced his opposition before the House Natural Resources Committee, which met for nearly 13 hours as they debated several bills. He was joined by many constituents from his parish and others, who all supported several bills which would have significantly limited carbon capture in the state.\nHollins and many rural Louisianans are particularly worried about the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines, calling it \"a pistol in their pocket.\"\n\"It's bad enough that communities don't have a say in this stuff,\" Hollins said in an interview. \"And landowners could be sued if they say no.\"\nCurrently, CO2 storage is considered a public good, which precludes its authority to use eminent domain. One bill would have revoked that status, but was rejected by the committee.\nAllen is the potential site of a carbon capture well for Denbury Inc., which was acquired by ExxonMobil in 2023. Exxon's current lobbyists have been paid at least $374,000, according to records from the Louisiana Ethics Administration.\nDenbury was hit with a fine of $2.4M for obstructing federal inspectors, as reported by Floodlight.\nThe inspection was \"related to the replacement of a segment of Denbury's 24-inch Delhi pipeline segment that ruptured on February 22, 2020, and resulted in the evacuation of a total of 200 residents and 45 residents being hospitalized in the town of Satartia, Mississippi.\"\nExxon defends the economic potential and safety of carbon capture vigorously and is likely to challenge Allen Parish Police Jury's ordinance.\nIn Louisiana, ExxonMobil is developing storage capacity in places like Allen Parish. This involves applying for a Class V permit to test the site's suitability. If tests confirm the geology is appropriate, the company would then apply for a Class VI permit for permanent CO₂ storage.\nMuch of Exxon's carbon capture and sequestration pipeline system is already built, which could ease the concerns of people like Hollins, who worry that industry will force landowners to give up their land for carbon capture storage and transportation.\nOn the economic benefits, a study conducted in partnership with McNeese State University assessed the local impact of carbon capture and sequestration projects. The study found that carbon capture and sequestration can generate substantial economic benefits — job creation, increased tax revenue, landowner payments (through leases, bonuses, and storage fees), and community investment. ExxonMobil expects its projects to deliver even greater returns.\nThe River Region Chamber of Commerce has endorsed carbon capture and sequestration as a \"game changing opportunity\" for Louisiana, calling it vital for attracting billions in industrial investment, creating jobs, and keeping the state competitive in global energy markets.\nCiting economist Loren Scott's forecast, the chamber highlighted that over $150 billion in planned projects depend on carbon capture and sequestration and renewable energy access.\nIt also framed carbon capture and sequestration as a safe, decades-old technology that can reduce emissions and modernize infrastructure without strict mandates — while offering new employment opportunities for Louisiana's shrinking oil and gas workforce.\nThe carbon capture and sequestration effort also positions Louisiana as a national leader in carbon storage, strengthening its industrial economy and enhancing long-term resilience, according to Exxon. There's growing demand, especially internationally, for low-carbon products — comparable to the way some consumers prefer organic food.",
