    "text": "Pakistan's Caretaker PM Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar Bans New Year 2024 Celebrations, Know Why The caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, has declared a strict ban on all forms of New Year celebrations across the country. Trending Photos New Delhi: Pakistan has instituted a nationwide prohibition on New Year's celebrations to express solidarity with Palestine. The interim Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, declared a stringent ban on any New Year celebrations as a demonstration of support for Palestine and Gaza, currently engaged in conflict with Israel. In his address to the nation, Kakar called for a demonstration of unity with the Palestinians and emphasized the importance of displaying sobriety and humility in the New Year. \"In light of the deeply troubling situation in Palestine and as a gesture of solidarity with our Palestinian brethren, the government has declared a stringent prohibition on hosting any form of New Year events,\" said Kakar. \"The entire Pakistan and the Muslim world are deeply distressed by the tragedy of innocent children being massacred and the genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,\" he added. Kakar mentioned that Pakistan has dispatched two aid packages to Palestine, with a third one in the works. He underscored Pakistan's consistent endeavors to shed light on the plight of the Palestinian people on international forums, reiterating the nation's dedication to persist in these efforts to bring an end to the violence inflicted by Israel. Israel vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters burst into Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages. Its air, sea and ground offensive in Gaza has since killed nearly 21,000 Palestinians, according to authorities. Live Tv",

    "text": "Pope Francis asserted in a soon-to-be-released interview that Ukraine should have the “courage” to enter into negotiations with Russia to end the war between the two countries before “things get worse.”\nUkraine entered its third year of war with Russia on Feb. 24 after mounting a failed counteroffensive and\nfacing the prospect of delayed and diminished Western support. Francis said Ukraine should negotiate as its prospects of winning the war continue to slip away, according to an interview transcript and clip shared with Reuters on Saturday.\nWATCH:\n“I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,” Francis asserted in the interview slated to air March 20, according to Reuters. “The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,” Francis said.\n“One may feel shame,” Francis added, “but how many dead will it (the war) end up with? (One should) negotiate in time, find a country that can be a mediator. Do not be ashamed of negotiating, before things get worse.”\nThe Pope also indicated he was available to help with negotiations, saying at one point, “Negotiating is never a surrender.”\nPresident Joe Biden’s White House\ndenied Reuters reporting in February that his administration played a role in killing a potential Ukraine ceasefire proposal from Russia, in a statement to the Daily Caller. The White House told the Caller that the reporting originates from a biased Russian point of view and asserted that neither Russia nor its president Vladimir Putin ever brought forward a ceasefire proposal.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "text": "If life turned out the way Misha Zelinsky once envisaged, the trained economist would be serving as a member of federal parliament right now.\nIn February 2022, Zelinsky was trying to parlay his experience as assistant national secretary of one of the nation’s most powerful unions, the Australian Workers Union, into preselection for the safe Labor seat of Cunningham on the NSW South Coast.\nMisha Zelinsky with his book The Sun will Rise, a novel based on stories he heard while covering the war in Ukraine.\nBut his candidacy fell apart when a satirical female advice book he co-wrote 10 years earlier resurfaced and was blasted as “demeaning to women”. Just 10 days after dropping out of the race, Zelinsky popped up in The Australian Financial Review reporting from Kyiv.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was still a few days away but Zelinsky’s Ukrainian heritage and Russian language skills helped him get a head start on much of the world’s media.\nEager for a challenge and an adventure, he convinced the paper’s editor, Michael Stutchbury, to let him cover the war even though he had no reporting experience.\n“How do you become a war correspondent?” Zelinsky asks. “You can spend 20 years grinding it out in a newsroom, learning how to do it properly and apply for a posting – or you just turn up and start doing it.”\nAll up, Zelinsky has made six trips to Ukraine to tell the story of people living in a democratic nation under attack by an aggressive, expansionist neighbour.\nHis reporting and social media posts make clear he sees the war as a battle between good and evil, not a conflict that can be assessed through the lens of balanced, “both sides” journalism. Now Zelinsky has turned the unlikely side hustle of war correspondent into another: novelist.\nThis month Zelinsky published The Sun Will Rise, a book he readily admits “horrified” his publishers when he pitched it to them.\nThey’d expected him to write a conventional non-fiction account of the war. But Zelinsky, a fresh-faced 39-year-old, thought a fictionalised narrative would be the best way to interest readers in a conflict that has dragged on for almost two years and no longer dominates the daily news headlines.\n“My background is in public policy; I’m someone who believes in facts, figures, logic, reason,” he says. “To the extent they ever carried the day, they certainly don’t now.”\nZelinsky describes the book as an “unashamedly ideological” piece of political fiction inspired by the likes of George Orwell’s 1984. Former treasurer and current Labor Party president Wayne Swan calls it “a love letter to the human spirit”.\n“This is a story with a purpose,” Zelinsky says. “It’s a call to action. If people care about the story I want them to become engaged and do something to help Ukraine.”\nThe novel centres on Oksana Shevchenko, a 31-year-old union leader who is forced by invading Russian troops to help operate her town’s nuclear power plant. The town is clearly based on Zaporizhzhia, a city in southern Ukraine where the nuclear power plant was seized by Russia soon after the invasion, raising fears of a nuclear catastrophe.\nThe fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine helped inspire Zelinsky’s writing.\n“It’s a tribute to the incredible bravery of ordinary people thrust into an extraordinary situation, and that what I observed in my time there,” Zelinksy says.\nToo many contemporary novelists have turned inwards, he says, focusing on the ennui and alienation of life under late-stage capitalism rather than the great political battles of the era.\n“I do think that they’re not ambitious enough, or at least not trying to paint the stakes in a way those legendary authors of the 20th century did,” he says.\n“I hope my book helps people connect with the stakes and understand why what happens in Ukraine matters everywhere and matters for Australia because we’re a country of 24 million people.\n“We cannot exist in a world where dictators can destroy democracies, where big countries can destroy little countries because they don’t like them.”\nMore explicitly, he warns that Chinese President Xi Jinping will be emboldened to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan if Putin seizes large chunks of Ukrainian territory. Such a scenario could drag Australia into war with its biggest trading partner.\nAlthough this year’s Ukrainian counter-offensive proved disappointing, Zelinsky argues: “They’re still taking back territory every day, it’s just not at a fast pace. And the frustrating thing is that they’re still doing it with one hand tied behind their back. They still don’t have jets, they still don’t have all the weapons that they need.”\nUltimately, Zelinsky says, the war will be determined by whether Western democracies like the US, UK and Australia have enough patience and fortitude to continue providing Ukraine with the military aid it needs to continue fighting.\nEmergency services in front of apartment building hit by a missile in central Kyiv in June 2022.\n“The Ukrainians have made it very clear they will fight and die and expel the Russians from their territory, but they need the weapons to do it. If we don’t give them the weapons, then it’s all lost. It staggers me that we would even wonder whether or not we should do that,” Zelinsky says.\nCall it fact or fiction, it’s a message he wants to spread any way he can.\nGet a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.
