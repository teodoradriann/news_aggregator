    "text": "NEW DELHI: In December this year, the mean maximum temperature was 24.1 degrees Celsius, significantly higher than the normal of 22.8 degrees C, while the mean minimum was 8.6 degrees C, a shade higher than the normal (8.4 degrees C). Not since 2017 have both the mean maximum and minimum temperatures been above normal in December.On the last day of the year, however, the day temperature dipped to the season’s lowest of 15.9 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung on Sunday, 4.5 degrees below normal. However, the met department said while the maximum temperature met conditions for a ‘cold day’ to the declared, the minimum temperature did not. The day’s minimum was 11.7 degrees C while for ‘cold day’ conditions to be met, it has to be below 10 degrees. In the city, SPS Mayur Vihar saw the lowest maximum temperature of 13.3 degrees C. 106426424Officials said cold day conditions are likely at isolated places on Monday with ‘yellow’ alert in place. December 2023 just ‘trace’ rainfall on one day and ended with a rain deficit of 100%. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, IMD, said, “The western disturbances, which impacted the hills, were not strong enough to cause significant snowfall in western Himalayan region. Only light snowfall was recorded in December and the snow melted easily. Whenever there is a good snowfall, the north-westerly winds bring chilly winds to Delhi.”The plains saw two feeble western disturbances in December. “In absence of a strong western disturbance impacting the plains, only drizzles were recorded at isolated places in Delhi. Since there was no cloudiness, the sun shone brightly on most days leading to a higher day temperature than normal. As winds blew on most days, the minimum temperature also did not witness a sharp dip,” said Srivastava. 106333509The average maximum temperature in December was two degrees higher than the normal mark. Safdarjung, the city’s base station, recorded day temperature in the range of 24-25 degrees Celsius on most days and the maximum temperature saw a drop only in the last week of December. The day temperature was below 20 degrees Celsius on two days- December 30 and 31. 106392411Like at Safdarjung, the difference in maximum and minimum temperatures at other stations on Sunday was low. The maximum and minimum temperatures were 16.1 and 11.7 degrees Celsius at Palam, 15 and 10.8 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road and 15 and 12.1 degrees Celsius at Jafarpur, respectively.“Throughout the day, Delhi saw uplifted fog. As the fog was at surface height of 100-150 metres, it looked like clouds,” said Srivastava. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 16 and 8 degrees Celsius on Monday. 106281981",

    "text": "By Anne Erickson ,\n7 hours ago Michigan enjoyed a very mild Christmas, so if you’re someone who doesn’t like the brutally cold temperatures, then you probably loved the warm weather over the holidays. But, Michigan is gearing up for severe winter weather. Just a few days ago, it almost felt like spring in some areas of lower Michigan, with light rain and dew taking the place of snow and ice. One good thing about the mild weather is that the roads were good for most of the holiday, so if you had to travel, you didn’t have to fend with ice and snow. But, now, there’s a change for the next two weeks, and here’s what you can expect. Read full article\nRead in NewsBreak 68",

    "title": "Joe Biden Gets a Participation Trophy From the Media for This? – PJ Media",
    "text": "The media sure is desperate to find something to boast about from Joe Biden's campaign. Anyone who has been paying attention recently knows, there isn't a lot of good news from the Biden camp these days. Even after the verdict from Donald Trump's sham trial in New York, Biden couldn't manage to take a solid lead in the polls. So now, they're taking something embarrassing and passing it off as a huge victory for Biden.\nI'm not exaggerating. Politico has written a puff piece about Joe Biden having his \"biggest online fundraising day\" after Trump's conviction.\n\"Donald Trump wasn’t the only one to get a fundraising boost off his New York hush money conviction — so did Joe Biden,\" the outlet writes . \"The president’s campaign had its single biggest day of online fundraising the day after Trump was convicted, according to a POLITICO analysis of federal campaign finance data. And as the money flowed in, his political operation also drew more new donors the day of the verdict than any day since Biden launched his campaign last year.\"\nIt sounds like Biden achieved something amazing, doesn't it? He must have been going all Scrooge McDuck, just diving into piles and piles of money, right? It sure sounds like it, based on the way they're hyping this up. The article didn't give a number just yet, so Politico had to keep hyping it up.\nRelated : Have You Seen the Newest Trump Ads? Stop What You're Doing and Check Them Out!\nAccording to the report, on the day of the verdict and the day after, the Biden campaign \"brought in totals six times higher than Biden’s typical fundraising day.\"\nThe suspense is killing you, isn't it?\n\" The boost for the incumbent, and a smaller one for down-ballot Democrats, made the day after Trump’s conviction the biggest overall fundraising day on ActBlue so far this cycle,\" the article continues.\nFinally, five paragraphs into the story, Politico reveals Joe Biden's big fundraiser boon: $8.1 million.\nYep. That's it. That's $8.1 million between the Biden campaign and two joint fundraising committees.\nLet's put that in perspective: The Trump campaign and its joint fundraising committees raised $52.8 million in the first 24 hours after the verdict , more than $2 million an hour.\nRelated: The Biden Campaign Must Be Freaking Out Over This News\nPolitico didn't even try to pretend that Biden's haul was impressive compared to Trump's. The article conceded that Biden's $8.1 million take \"still pales in comparison to what Trump’s campaign said it raised in the aftermath of his conviction. The former president’s massive intake of donations helped him overtake Biden in cash on hand.\"\nNow you understand why Politico buried the lede. Yet the outlet still tried to put lipstick on the pig.\nThe article said the \"surge in financial support for Biden suggests the conviction was a wake-up call for many grassroots donors who have been holding back so far this cycle, and it’s a much-needed moment of fundraising energy for Biden’s campaign.\"\nIsn't that cute? Donald Trump eclipses Joe Biden's fundraising and erases his cash advantage in a flash, yet, according to Politico, it's the Biden campaign that has awoken the sleeping giant. It's like Politico awarded Biden a participation trophy for his fundraising and thought we wouldn't notice.",
