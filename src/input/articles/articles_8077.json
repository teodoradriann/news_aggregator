    "title": "Chris Roemer: Butker should ‘rejoice and be exceedingly glad’ he is being persecuted for remaining faithful to God | COMMENTARY – Baltimore Sun",
    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker recently gave a commencement speech at Benedictine College, a private Catholic liberal arts school of higher learning in Atchison, Kansas. Progressives across the country expressed outrage at the message Butker delivered. GLADD, “a non-profit organization focused on LGBTQ advocacy and cultural change,” issued a statement calling Butker’s speech “a clear miss” and “woefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.” That Butker’s comments were “woefully out of step” with American culture is no surprise. The Apostle Paul explains why in 1 Corinthians 2. “The person without the Spirit,” Paul writes, “does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.” In his Sermon on the Mount, Christ proclaims, “Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven.” In John’s gospel, Christ told his disciples, “If the world hates you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” Butker should “rejoice and be exceedingly glad” he is being persecuted for remaining faithful to God’s word. Have we really reached a point in American society where women who find fulfillment in marriage, relish their role as a mother and make raising their children a priority are worthy of derision and contempt? Apparently so. What the unbelieving world fails to understand is that a Christian’s beliefs are not whims which change with societal norms. Their beliefs are based on what they consider to be Holy Scripture — the word of God. For the secular world to demand Christians abandon their faith so that their beliefs and values more closely mirror its own is appalling and wrong. To claim that kind of authority over a person’s conscience goes far beyond simple tyranny. It’s the stuff of Kim Jong Un and Mao. Jesus did not poll test his messages before he delivered them. Neither should we. In fact, what Jesus taught was so “out of step” with the culture of his day, not only was he mocked and ridiculed, as Butker is being mocked and ridiculed today, ultimately Jesus was nearly beaten to death — and then crucified. The sad reality is, most people no longer believe the bible is God’s word, or accept its authority over their lives. More and more, God’s word is being marginalized by nominal Christians. Whole Christian denominations are replacing God’s definitions of right and wrong with conceptions of their own creation. Churches everywhere have concluded biblical truth needs to be “modified” so as not to offend an increasingly unbelieving world. That there is a growing tide of hostility toward faithful Christianity is to be expected. Paul warned in 2 Timothy, a “time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” There is no shortage of false teachers in modern society, but the good news is nothing can change that Jesus is still the Lord of the Harvest, and there are souls yet to be gathered into God’s kingdom. We need to continue to pray God sends forth laborers to do the work. It is gratifying someone of Butker’s stature counts himself among them. Since his speech, Butker has not backed down in the face of the avalanche of criticism that has come his way. In response to the criticism, Butker reaffirmed his commitment to his faith, saying, “Our love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world.” Jesus never compromised or hid the truth so as not to offend those who did not believe. Neither should we. If we remain faithful despite the criticism we receive, when we come to the end of our lives, like Paul, we will be able to say, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.” Butker intended his comments to be heard by a few hundred Benedictine graduates and their families. God had other plans. He used the abuse hurled at Butker to take those comments around the world, and only God knows the fruit they will bear. And because of his faith in Christ, and only because of his faith in Christ, there is a “crown of righteousness” for Butker, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give him at the day of his appearing. “The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.” — 1 John 2:17 Chris Roemer is a retired banker and educator who resides in Finksburg.

    "text": "A última etapa da temporada 2024 do Campeonato Mundial de MotoGP, marcada para Valência, foi cancelada devido às enchentes que atingiram a região. A corrida estava prevista para ser realizada entre os dias 15 e 17 de novembro.\nPor meio de um comunicado, a MotoGP informou que em breve, um novo circuito deve ser definido para sediar a última corrida da temporada. A organização prestou sua solidariedade às vítimas da tragédia que já deixou mais de 200 mortos naquela que é considerada a maior enchente do século na Espanha.\n“Temos estado em contato constante com as autoridades locais e o circuito para avaliar melhor como podemos ajudar e como devemos proceder. Temos uma responsabilidade com cada região onde corremos que vai muito além do esporte e dos eventos”, diz parte do texto.\nA decisão pelo adiamento foi definida após um acordo com as autoridades da Comunidade Valenciana e a Comissão da Segurança. Após o último balanço das autoridades, dezenas de pessoas estão desaparecidas.\nNa classificação do Mundial de pilotos, o espanhol Jorge Martín é o favorito ao título e lidera a tabela com 453. O italiano Francesco Bagnaia aparece em segundo lugar e contabiliza 436.",

The two Japanese-derived trucks sold a combined 38,205 copies this year so far, making them far less successful than the monocoque American midsize lifestyle truck. For Q3 alone, Toyota confirms 4,518 unit sales of the Tacoma Hybrid and 4,122 copies of the Tundra Hybrid. Ford highlights that its hybrid truck duo constitutes 77 percent of the hybrid truck marketshare for Q3. Ford's hybrid option for the Maverick was a far more popular option, as the EcoBoost turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder model only managed to rake in 11,740 sales within the same timeframe.\nPros Decent towing capacity for its class Sporty ride Favorable fuel consumption returns Cons Poor comfort levels Cheap-feeling interior Minimal key standard features Ford confirms that it has sold 108,996 Mavericks this year so far, with the bulk of these being the Hybrid derivative, making it one of the brand's most successful products. The Maverick has only been available on the market for a few years, but its success highlights how so many consumers value the versatility of a monocoque compact truck that fits well into urban areas with some level of durability while lightly off-roading .\nRelated Here's How Much A Fully Loaded Ford Maverick Hybrid Costs The 2025 Ford Maverick is loaded to the gills, but if you want to personalize it even further, here's how much it would cost you.\nHow Much A 2024 Ford Maverick Hybrid Costs\nFord For 2024, the Ford Maverick range currently starts at $25,670 for the base XL trim. Options include the exclusive $495 metallic paint shades, Ford's Co-Pilot360 package for $650, a $1,200 tonneau rollup box cover, or a folding one for $1,180. You can also get bed crossbars for $680 and a soft folding cover for $590. Beyond this, there are a host of accessories and pieces of equipment that you can specify based on your particular needs.\nTrim Level\nBase Price\nXL\n$25,670\nXLT\n$30,460\nLariat\n$34,240\nThe XLT is a more lifestyle-oriented derivative, boasting a $30,460 starting price. This benefits from more color options and alloy wheels. The Luxury Package adds a host of exclusive features for $2,275. You can also black-out the exterior trimmings for $1,645. The Lariat sits at the top of the range at $34,240, but it includes the Luxury Package and CoPilot as standard. You also get access to a few more optional extras.\nAdd TopSpeed to your Google News feed.\nFollow On Google News\nFord Maverick Consumption And Range Estimates\nFord As per the EPA, the Ford Maverick Hybrid returns a 42/33/37 MPG consumption estimate on the city/highway/combined cycle. Boasting a 13.8-gallon tank and 1.1 kWh lithium-ion battery, you can also expect it to cover a fairly impressive 511 miles on a single tank. The EPA estimates that you'll save up to $2,000 on fuel over five years, while spending $1,300 on gasoline every year. This equates to $2.15 for every 25 miles you drive. It will cost you $44 to fill the tank.\nCity\nHighway\nCombined\nAnnual Fuel Cost (est)\n2.0L EcoBoost\n23 MPG\n30 MPG\n26 MPG\n$1,850\n2.5L Hybrid\n42 MPG\n33 MPG\n37 MPG\n$1,300\nFor reference, the EcoBoost is the entry-level powertrain, but it does benefit from an optional all-wheel drive system. The EPA estimates the front-wheel drive variant will return a 23/30/26 MPG and cover 429 miles on a single tank, measuring 16.5 gallons. With this model, you're likely to spend $1,850 on fuel every year, equating to $750 worth of savings over five years. It'll cost you $3.06 to drive 25 miles and $52 to fill up the tank.\nReview 2024 Ford Maverick Lariat FWD Hybrid - The Compact Pickup That Thinks It's A Car Responsive, comfortable and quiet, the 2024 Ford Maverick Lariat FWD Hybrid compact pickup behaves more like a car than a truck.\n3 The Ford Maverick Hybrid Drivetrain Pushes Out 191 Horsepower\nFord The Ford Maverick Hybrid features the brand's naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with one permanent-magnet motor. This generates a combined 191 horsepower and 155 pound-feet to the front wheels via a direct-drive eCVT system. Ford is finally adding an all-wheel drive option to the 2025 model year. As per the brand's claims, you can expect the Maverick Hybrid to cover a 0-60 MPH sprint in 8.0 seconds and hit a 110 MPH top speed. If you fit the optional tow package, you get access to a 4,000-pound towing capacity.\nPerformance Specifications Price $25,670 Powertrain 2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder And One Permanent-Magnet Motor Horsepower 191 HP Torque 155 LB-FT Transmission Direct-Drive eCVT Driveline Front-Wheel Drive Battery 1.1 kWh Range 511 Miles Fuel Economy 37 MPG 0-60 MPH 8.0 Seconds Top Speed 110 MPH Towing Capacity 4,000 Pounds According to Consumer Reports , Ford's hybrid mid-size truck option benefits from a 77/100 overall score, together with an 82/100 road test score and a 60/100 predicted reliability score. It also indicates that you'll experience a 5/5 owner satisfaction experience. The review highlights that the Maverick Hybrid excels at offering good fuel economy from the hybrid system, together with competent ride and handling characteristics. It does get some criticism for its poor cabin quality.\nThe NHTSA does not issue any recalls for the 2024 Maverick Hybrid, but the non-HEV variation currently has seven recalls attached to it , which include problems with the rearview camera, windshield wiper motor, software glitches, and taillights. We assume that these problems do affect the hybrid model, considering they all come off the same production line.\nWhy The Ford Maverick Hybrid's Success Will Continue In 2025\nFord The 2025 Ford Maverick will continue to rise to success thanks to several thoughtful changes that appeal to this year's market trends. As of right now, the 2.5-liter hybrid powertrain is an optionally available powertrain, with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine being the standard offering. For 2025, the brand has decided to swap this around in order to make the hybrid a more accessible option. This is a logical move considering a bulk of the sales already go to the hybrid derivative.\nKey Changes For The 2025 Ford Maverick Hybrid The 2025 Ford Maverick offers a new hybrid all-wheel drive option for improved traction and versatility. A 13.2-inch touchscreen with the updated Sync 4 system is now standard, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Maverick adds a sport-focused Lobo trim with lowered suspension, performance-tuned handling, and exclusive design elements. Off-road enthusiasts can opt for the enhanced Tremor model with trail capabilities. A fresh front-end design includes redesigned headlights and grille for a modern look. New exterior color options, including Eruption Green and Velocity Blue, expand customization. Ford justifies this decision by clarifying that the hybrid offers sufficient performance and fuel economy in relation to the EcoBoost. The addition of an optional all-wheel drive system for the Hybrid further increases its appeal and will likely be a big motivator for many potential buyers to opt for the hybrid Maverick. For 2025, Ford is also adding the Tremor package as a unique trim level for those wanting a more off-road aesthetic. It will also include the Trail Control system for enhanced traction on loose surfaces. The entire range will benefit from more in-depth towing functions via an optional package.\nFord Toyota Ford Maverick Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close",

    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // Australian authorities this week arrested a retired Catholic bishop on charges of sexual offenses including rape, assault, and child abuse. Retired Bishop Christopher Saunders of Broome, Australia was arrested Wednesday on 19 [charges](https://catholicvote.org/child-abuse-detectives-search-bishop-house/) for offenses that date from 2008 to 2014. Saunders was released on bail on Thursday and remains under house arrest until his hearing, which is set for June. [According](https://www.ncregister.com/cna/australian-bishop-christopher-saunders-arrested-charged-with-rape) to the National Catholic Register, Saunders, 74, was charged with two counts of rape, 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault, and three counts of “indecently dealing with a child as a person in authority.” The offenses reportedly took place in the towns of Broome, Kununurra, and the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu. Bishop Saunders will plead not guilty to the charges brought against him, according to local reports. On Thursday, the President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Timothy Costelloe [stated](https://www.catholic.au/s/article/Matter-regarding-Bishop-Christopher-Saunders): “Allegations against the former Bishop of Broome, Christopher Saunders are very serious and deeply distressing, especially for those making those allegations.” “It is right and proper, and indeed necessary, that all such allegations be thoroughly investigated,” Costelloe added. “The Church will continue to cooperate fully with the police and take every necessary step to avoid any actions which may compromise the integrity and autonomy of the police investigation.” Allegations against Saunders were first made in 2020. [According](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2024-02/christopher-saunders-charged-timothy-costelloe-investigation.html) to Vatican News, independent investigators carried out a [canonical investigation](https://catholicvote.org/australian-bishop-under-vatican-investigation-sexual-misconduct/) ordered by Pope Francis. Saunders resigned in 2021. The investigation ended with a 200 page report that was given to Australian police. Vatican News reported, “After this report was handed over to Australian police, they opened a new investigation into Bishop Emeritus Saunders. It is as part of this investigation that he has now been charged.”",

    "text": "Boeing Faces $1.3 Billion Monthly Loss Amid Union Strike Vote [Hannah Lewis](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79548)Updated: 09-13-2024 07:23 AM Major Free Cash Flow Impacts for Boeing Amid IAM Strike Vote Boeing is currently navigating turbulent waters as it faces a potential monthly free cash flow (FCF) impact exceeding $1.3 billion due to a strike vote by the IAM 751 union. This significant possibility arises as the union overwhelmingly opted for a strike after rejecting Boeing's proposed contract. Analysts from Jefferies have highlighted the critical nature of this development for the company’s financial health. Understanding the Union’s Decision to Strike The IAM union made its decision following a decisive 95% rejection of Boeing's offered contract, with a staggering 96% of its members voting in favor of striking action. This overwhelming response suggests deep-rooted dissatisfaction with the current terms and raises questions about Boeing's ability to maintain its operations without significant disruptions. Historical Context of Strikes at Boeing Looking back at history, Jefferies points out that the last major strike in 2008 had severe ramifications. Lasting 58 days, it resulted in more than 100 aircraft delivery delays and a net income impact of approximately $1.2 billion—a financial hit of around $600 million per month. Such impacts serve as a reminder of how prolonged labor actions can ripple through the company's operations. Potential Financial Disruptions Jefferies drew attention to the potential consequences if the current strike is drawn out over time. The 2008 strike culminated in a massive $2.5 billion FCF loss, highlighting the significant financial risks involved in the ongoing action. Therefore, the firm warns that if the IAM strike continues, Boeing's financial situation could worsen dramatically. Union Contract Rejection Factors In early September, the IAM union reached an agreement on a new contract that included wage increases over its duration, starting with a notable 11% hike in the first year followed by a total increase of 25%. Despite these increases, the union members’ dissatisfaction stemmed from insufficient wage growth and the elimination of an AMPP bonus, which had been pivotal in encouraging safety and productivity within the workforce. Concerns over Future Aircraft Developments Another critical issue raised by union members was Boeing’s commitment to developing a next-generation aircraft in Puget Sound, a vital element of the contract discussions. This uncertainty adds another layer of complexity to the negotiations and illustrates the need for Boeing's management to reassess their approach to employee relations. The Urgency for Negotiations Jefferies analysts have stressed that the current strike could be as disruptive as those in Boeing's past. Nonetheless, they believe there is a strong incentive for Boeing’s leadership to engage in swift negotiations aimed at reaching a resolution. The management is likely to strive for a settlement that minimizes operational disruptions and the financial repercussions that accompany prolonged strike activity. With such significant potential losses on the horizon, navigating through this phase will demand strategic planning and effective communication from Boeing. The urgency to address the union's concerns while maintaining steady operations will be paramount to mitigate the escalating financial toll. Frequently Asked Questions What financial impact does the IAM strike have on Boeing? The IAM union strike could result in over $1.3 billion in monthly free cash flow losses for Boeing, a serious financial concern for the company. What led to the union's decision to strike? The union voted to strike after an overwhelming rejection of Boeing's proposed contract, indicating widespread dissatisfaction among its members. What historical context is relevant to Boeing's current situation? The last major strike at Boeing in 2008 resulted in significant delays and a $2.5 billion FCF impact, underscoring the potential financial repercussions of labor disputes. How is Boeing responding to the strike threat? Boeing's leadership is likely to engage in negotiations swiftly to address union concerns and minimize operational disruptions. What are the implications of the contract rejection? The rejection of the contract deal points to deeper issues within employee satisfaction and Boeing’s future commitments to aircraft development.
