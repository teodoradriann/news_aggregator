    "text": "By Bill Galluccio ,\n12 hours ago Photo: DekiArt / E+ / Getty Images A missing man was found in a remote canyon in Big Basin Redwoods State Park in California following a nine-day search. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office said the 34-year-old Lukas McClish was last seen on June 11, hiking near Boulder Creek.\nHis family reported him missing, and numerous agencies engaged in a massive search throughout the heavily wooded area.\nOn Thursday (June 20), hikers near Foreman Creek heard cries for help and contacted the police. Firefighters followed his cries for help but struggled to pinpoint his location amid the rough terrain.\n\"There are no trails, no roads, several miles from the closest place to a road, which the closest road that we got into, we had to four-wheel drive probably a quarter of a mile in, and then we couldn't go further,\" Boulder Creek Fire Protection District Chief Mark Bingham told the Santa Cruz Sentinal .\nWith the help of a police dog, the rescuers managed to locate McClish at the bottom of a canyon. Surprisingly, he was relatively unharmed, suffering only a minor injury.\n\"About 10 days, he survived in the wilderness, essentially, drinking out of the creek and eating wild berries,\" Bingham said. \"He did have a minor injury … but, for the most part, he was disoriented and lost and surviving off of the land, which is pretty impressive to say what a tough individual he was or is.\"\nWith the help of the rescue crew, McClish was able to hike out of the area.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Even Arianna Grande Is Quiet Luxury Now",
    "text": "Arianna Grande has emerged from self-imposed isolation in full quiet luxury mode. Well, maybe 1/4 quiet luxury mode, but the point is made.\nGrande's personal off-duty style is solid. She typically dresses for comfort, rather than outré flair, and there's nothing wrong with that. It just doesn't often make for a bigly style moment.\nWhich makes the fact that Grande is clutching a $7,000 The Row handbag all the more intriguing.\nThis isn't just Grande's first outfit of 2024 but one of her first paparazzi photos in years, maybe even the first one in casual dress since 2021. That's a long while to go without a 'fitpic.\nIt's not a wild look in and of itself, which makes Grande's accessorizing all the more impactful.\nGossip sites and fanpages alike were set alight by Grande's sweatshirt alone, an oversized black number printed with two words: \"Yes, and?\"\nConsidering that this woman's song titles rarely surpass three words, it's been widely (and not unjustly) speculated that Grande is hinting at the first single from the album that she's presumably been working on for the past two years or so.\nIt's otherwise Ariana Grande business as usual, with nails done, blonde hair in a long ponytail, washed-out straight-leg jeans, and leather mules. Classic stuff.\nBut Grande zuzhed the whole thing up in a quintessentially quiet luxury kinda way, with The Row's XL-sized\nleather Devon bag, retailing upwards of $7,000.\nThat's a lotta moolah for a brandless bag, which is obviously the point of quiet luxury and all. The aesthetic was always about\npaying top dollar for qualitatively better stuff, only recognizable through humbly potent accessories and objectively stylish outfits. They don't scream good taste, they whisper.\nThere's been ample pushback and even widespread desire to move\nbeyond quiet luxury as a concept but that's only among the proletariat.\nAriana Grande has the dinero to use a The Row bag as a work tote and, thus, very much fits the quiet luxury lifestyle.\nFrankly, The Row seems a good fit for Grande in general, given the label's proposition of clothes that're as effortless as they are exquisite. For someone who seems to prefer getting dressed with ease, without sacrificing comfort, could be an easy stylistic upgrade.\nFor now, as good as her bag is, it's a tad out of place. Notice how the OIsen twins' own\nbeat-up Birkins look utterly organic when worn with their own layers of slouchy luxe — it's all about the complete look and Grande could certainly pull it off if she was willing to commit to quiet luxury.\nThis is probably Grande's last paparazzi appearance until her album is ready to go, which will presumably be sometime towards the end of 2024 and closer to the launch of Wicked, the\nmovie musical in which she plays Glinda, the good witch.\nGet a good, long, last glimpse at Grande's luxurious look, Arianators. It'll have to do for now.",

    "text": "Bhubaneswar: Rourkela recorded the lowest temperature of 8.1°C on Friday, as several parts of the state witnessed a gradual dip in mercury over the past three days, accompanied by dense fog, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported.G Udayagiri in Kandhamal district followed Rourkela with 8.4°C while Jharsuguda registered the highest temperature deviation, with a 3.5°C dip below the normal to 9.8°C.Dense fog enveloped Rourkela, Phulbani and Koraput during morning hours, disrupting traffic movement. The state capital recorded 14.5°C, 1.5°C below the normal.\\\"Clear skies and changing wind patterns have contributed to the temperature drop,\\\" said Manorama Mohanty, scientist and head of the regional IMD centre here. She said cold conditions emerged after the western disturbance-induced rain possibility subsided.IMD has forecast the cold trend to continue for the next three days, followed by a possible 2-4°C rise in minimum temperature over the subsequent two days. Shallow to moderate fog is expected to persist, particularly in Jharsuguda, Ganjam and Kalahandi districts on Saturday.Following the IMD's fog advisory, the special relief commissioner's office has directed district collectors to implement necessary measures for regulated vehicle movement on highways.",
