    "text": "Resguardo policial reapareció en la plaza Murillo que no estaba cuando ingresaron los militares Este jueves no solo los efectivos de la UTOP están, también los Delta y el GEA aparecieron en la plaza controlando todos los accesos El resguardo policial que siempre está presente en la plaza Murillo reapareció este jueves con distintas unidades y no solo con la UTOP, que es la unidad a cargo de la seguridad en la histórica plaza, hubieron efectivos de otras reparticiones policiales. El miércoles cuando ingresaron los militares inexplicablemente oficiales de la UTOP no estaban. “Los militares ingresaron con armas de guerra y expulsaron a todos de la plaza Murillo”, fue la evasiva explicación que ensayó el viceministro Jhonny Aguilera cuando le consultaron sobre las razones de la ausencia de policías que están custodiando la plaza todos los días y a toda hora. La Unidad Táctica de Operaciones Policiales (UTOP) tiene su cuartel a media cuadra de la plaza Murillo, al lado de la Cancillería en la calle Junín. Es una unidad de reacción rápida principalmente para controlar disturbios. El miércoles, los efectivos de la UTOP estaban una cuadra más allá de la plaza restringiendo el ingreso de las personas al lugar del conflicto, parecía que la Policía resguardaba a los militares apiñados en plaza Murillo. En la calle Potosí, donde es uno de los ingresos a la Casa Grande del Pueblo había como ocho camionetas de policías, no ingresaron a los garajes del palacio, estaban sobre la calle. Este jueves, no solo había vuelto la UTOP sino que otras unidades como los Delta o los GEA, que estaban con todo su equipo, formaron barreras, cortaron el paso vehicular en todas los accesos y una camioneta giraba lentamente por toda la plaza ante la mirada curiosa de decenas de medios de comunicación internacionales que arribaron al país atraídos por la noticia de un ‘golpe de estado’. Según el ministro de Defensa, Edmundo Novillo, todo había vuelto a la tranquilidad ayer en la noche luego de que se retomara el control de los altos mandos. De hecho, los conscriptos de la Policía Militar que resguardaron la plaza desde mediodía tuvieron que salir huyendo de la plaza Murillo a bordo de dos camiones que los trajeron desde la zona de San Jorge.",

    "text": "BENGALURU: The Opposition BJP in Karnataka slammed the Congress State Government for passing the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Bill 2024 which mandates the government to collect 10% of revenue from temples whose revenue exceeds Rs 1 crore and 5% from temples whose revenue is between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore.\nThe Bill was passed in the state Assembly on Wednesday. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah hit back at the BJP saying that the allegations regarding the amendments to the Bill appear to be misrepresented for political gain. “There has always been a mandate to create a common pool since the enactment of the Act in 1997,” he said. Siddaramaiah also said that the common pool is administered solely for religious purposes connected with the Hindu religion.\nThe CM said that the common pool fund has been utilised only for religious purposes of Hindu institutions since the Act came into force in 2003, and it will continue to be used for the same purposes in the future. “It has not been utilised for any other purposes or the benefit of followers of other religions” he clarified. He denied there are misallocations of funds for non-Hindu purposes or the imposition of unfair taxes.\nEndowment Minister Ramalinga Reddy, hitting out at state BJP president BY Vijayendra, said it is clear that the BJP always pursues political gains by claiming that Congress is anti-Hindu. “However, we, the Congress, consider ourselves the true proponents of Hinduism because, over the years, Congress governments have consistently safeguarded temples and Hindu interests,” Reddy said.\nReddy also said that when the BJP was in power between 2008 and 2013 and between 2019 and 2023, funds were collected from the temples that were getting the highest revenue. “It seems they turned a blind eye to the revenues of Hindu religious institutions and charitable endowments, despite the existence of Acts or Bills in place since 2001. So, weren’t you also negligent regarding Hindu temple revenues?” Reddy asked.\nVijayendra had alleged that this Bill not only reflects the deplorable condition of the State Government but also shows its abject hate towards the Hindu dharma. “Temple funds should be dedicatedly utilised for the renovation of temples and to facilitate the work beneficial to devotees, rather than diverting it for other purposes, which would be an injustice and betrayal of people’s religious beliefs,” Vijayendra alleged. Many BJP leaders too made similar allegations.",

    "text": "Este mes el Instituto Cato y el Fraser Institute publicaron la última edición del Índice de Libertad Humana, que contiene datos de 2021 para 165 jurisdicciones, abarcando así un 98,8 % de la población mundial. A diferencia del Índice de Libertad Económica del Fraser Institute, este índice es hasta ahora la medición más comprensiva de la libertad en todas sus dimensiones, no solo la económica. Con base en 86 indicadores de libertades económicas y personales, el índice provee un vistazo al estado de la libertad en las siguientes áreas: (1) Estado de derecho, (2) seguridad, (3) libertad de movimiento, (4) religiosa, (5) de asociación, (6) de expresión y acceso a la información, (7) de tener relaciones íntimas y de familia, (8) de comercio, (9) el tamaño del Estado, (10) sistema legal y derechos de propiedad y (11) las regulaciones. Las dos últimas ediciones del índice nos permiten ver el dramático deterioro de la libertad humana que resultó de la pandemia del coronavirus. Los autores indican que, en una escala de 0 al 10, donde el 10 representa más libertad, el puntaje promedio de libertad humana para 165 jurisdicciones descendió ligeramente, de 6,79 en 2020 a 6,75 en 2021. Entre 2019 y 2021, 89,8 % de la población mundial experimentó un declive en su libertad, siendo muchas más las jurisdicciones que registraron una caída en su puntaje (146) que aquellas que presentaron una mejora (16). Las regiones que experimentaron la mayor caída en su puntaje durante los dos primeros años de la pandemia son Norteamérica, Asia del Este, América Latina y el Caribe. Lo interesante es que el declive en la libertad se venía dando desde 2007, cuando el mundo llegó a su punto máximo de libertad promedio desde el año 2000. Las jurisdicciones que más caídas han experimentado desde ese año son Nicaragua, República Árabe de Siria, Hong Kong, Egipto, Turquía, Hungría, Bahrain, Venezuela, Burundi y El Salvador. La data muestra que los altos niveles de libertad están concentrados en una pequeña porción de la población mundial: “Solo el 13,8 % de la población mundial vive en el cuartil superior de los países del índice, mientras que el 37,6 % de la población mundial vive en el cuartil inferior de los países con menores niveles de libertad”. China tiene mucho que ver con esta brecha de libertad, ya que, con su enorme población, se ubica en el cuartil más bajo del índice. Dentro de la región, otro país que ha experimentado un declive marcado desde el año 2000 es Argentina. Uno de los autores, Ian Vásquez, señala: “Durante los últimos veinte años de gobierno populista-peronista, el nivel de libertad de Argentina no ha dejado de disminuir, y su clasificación ha pasado de 41 en 2000 a 77 en el informe actual. Pero fue en términos de libertad económica donde el país sufrió un colapso total, pasando del puesto 40 en 2000 al 158 en el nuevo índice”. Ecuador, en cambio, se ubica en la posición 72 -misma posición que obtuvo en el 2000-, mejorando en tan solo 0,6 su puntaje de libertad humana desde el 2000 (de 6,97 a 7,03). En los dos primeros años de la pandemia el país experimentó un declive de 0,29 (de 7,38 a 7,03). Cabe notar que durante el correísmo Ecuador llegó a ubicarse en la posición 97 en el año 2014 con un puntaje de 6,76. (O)",

    "text": "Lewis Dunk wasn’t send off despite two reckless fouls on Dejan Kulusevski (Photo: Twitter / Getty)\nAnge Postecoglou aimed another dig at VAR after Brighton captain Lewis Dunk escaped a red card during Tottenham’s 4-2 loss to the Seagulls.\nSpurs were blown away at the Amex on Thursday night, with stunning strikes from Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan and two Joao Pedro penalties putting Brighton 4-0 up.\nThe North Londoners rallied late on with goals from Alejo Veliz – his first for the club – and Ben Davies giving them hope, but it was too late for a miraculous comeback.\nThere was a moment of controversy in the build-up to Veliz’s goal however, with Dunk making a reckless challenge on Dejan Kulusevski.\nMoreover, it wasn’t even the first time in the game that Dunk had made a studs up challenge on the Swede.\nThe England defender was booked for the second foul and will now miss Brighton’s next game against West Ham.\nPostecoglou seemed to think it was a sending off offence and blasted the Video Assistant Referee for not getting involved, while also sarcastically praising them for the way they awarded the first penalty.\n‘It’s amazing that VAR picks up everything apart from a tackle that maybe puts out another of our players,’ the manager said post-match.\n‘There are no grumbles from me with the penalties. They were clear and obvious. The first penalty was so clear and obvious it only took them three minutes to make the decision.’\nPostecoglou added that he believed Kulusevski was ‘okay’ after the fouls.\nThe result has left Tottenham fifth in the table, six points off leaders Liverpool, and they will be hoping to bounce back when they host Bournemouth on New Year’s Eve.\n‘Look, fair to say we were looking a bit tired and lacked our usual sharpness, especially at the start of the game,’ the Spurs boss reflected.\n‘We’ve been starting games well. I guess that’s understandable, we’ve been on this run for a whole now and asking players to perform at levels.\n‘It’s very demanding the way we play physically and today we kind of looked like a team that wasn’t at its sharpest. Brighton are a good side and they took advantage of that.\n‘Ultimately what I do know is the players everything they had they gave and that’s all I can ask for.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
