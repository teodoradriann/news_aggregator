    "title": "Pound at five month high against the dollar amid hopes the UK will avoid a recession next year | Express Digest",
    "text": "The pound hit its highest level against the dollar in nearly five months amid gathering hopes that the UK will avoid a recession. Sterling climbed to $1.2827, its strongest since August 1, before giving up the gains later in the session. It comes as analysts see further gains for sterling against the dollar next year, with experts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicting it could hit $1.35. That would be a far cry from the aftermath of last year’s mini-Budget when sterling hit a record low of less than $1.04. The pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve looks closer to pulling the trigger on interest rate cuts next year. On the charge: The pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve will pull the trigger on interest rate cuts next year Markets are also looking ahead to next year’s Budget after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would take place on March 6. And a survey of 52 economists by Bloomberg suggested that the UK was heading for a so-called ‘soft landing’ in which inflation is brought down without causing a downturn. They predicted that after a bumpy start to next year, GDP would grow by 0.3 per cent as consumers enjoy lower inflation, bringing an end to the cost of living crisis. But the Bank of England predicts that growth will flatline in 2024. The report was not entirely positive, with a third forecasting that the economy will have shrunk in the fourth quarter of this year. That would imply a recession – defined as two quarters in a row of contraction – as GDP has already shrunk by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. Dan Hanson, at Bloomberg Economics, said the economy will ‘tread a fine line between stagnation and contraction in the first half’ of 2024. *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-12907557/Pound-five-month-high-against-dollar-amid-hopes-UK-avoid-recession-year.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "title": "When Worship is Dangerous: The Reality of Religious Freedom in Egypt",
    "text": "How would you feel if attending your place of worship could cost you your life? For many Americans, these questions might seem almost absurd. After all, religious freedom is a cornerstone of the U.S. Constitution. But for millions in Egypt, the ability to worship without fear remains a distant dream. Egypt is a cornerstone of the Middle East, with a rich history and a strategic location. Yet, the country’s restrictive policies towards religious minorities have long hampered its development. The Egyptian constitution recognizes Islam as the state religion, with Sharia law as the principal source of legislation. The result is systemic discrimination against non-Muslim communities, imposing restrictive laws that limit their ability to worship, educate, and even have representation in government. The consequences are more than just social inequities; they stifle creativity, limit economic growth, and foster societal tensions. As Egypt transitions from the chaos of the Arab Spring to a semblance of political stability, the plight of religious minorities—particularly Christians—should be a central focus for those who believe in human rights and religious freedom. Yet, despite promises from the Egyptian government to promote religious harmony, the reality on the ground tells a different story. The Egyptian government’s current stance on religious freedom creates a breeding ground for extremism and sectarian violence. We’ve seen this in the form of attacks on Coptic Christian churches and the forced displacement of Baha’is. These incidents aren’t isolated events and are symptomatic of a broader societal issue. The longer these policies persist, the more they jeopardize Egypt’s social cohesion, potentially leading to unrest and instability. In Egypt, Christians, primarily Copts , comprise about 10% of the population . They have been historically marginalized, often subject to discriminatory laws and violence . A stark reminder came in 2017 when twin bombings targeted Coptic churches on Palm Sunday, killing 45 people. While the Egyptian government pledged to protect religious minorities, incidents of discrimination and violence against Christians continue to surface. So, where’s the disconnect? The Egyptian constitution, revised in 2014 , technically guarantees freedom of religion. But there’s a catch. These guarantees come with significant limitations, allowing the government to impose restrictions in the name of public order and national security. This ambiguity creates an environment where religious minorities are vulnerable to persecution without much recourse. Promoting religious freedom in Egypt isn’t just a matter of human rights; it’s also an economic imperative. Countries with high levels of religious freedom tend to have more robust economies. A Religious Freedom & Business Foundation study found that religious freedom contributes to peaceful coexistence, which fosters innovation and attracts investment. Egypt could harness the full potential of its diverse population by allowing all religious groups to participate equally in the economy. Doing so would create more businesses, generate jobs, and stimulate the moribund economy. Moreover, promoting religious freedom can enhance Egypt’s international standing. As the world becomes more interconnected, countries that embrace diversity project greater stability and appear as more attractive partners. Egypt, with its deep historical and cultural ties to the Middle East and Africa, holds a unique position to benefit from such a shift. Egypt could strengthen its relationships with Western countries by fostering religious freedom, many of which prioritize human rights in their foreign policy. So, what can the country do about it? First, Egypt must reform its legal system to ensure equal treatment for all religious groups. Eliminating discriminatory laws, streamlining the process of building places of worship, and ensuring that all religious communities have the right to educate their children according to their beliefs are essential. Second, the Egyptian government should engage in a public awareness campaign to promote tolerance and understanding among its citizens. Important steps include educational programs, interfaith dialogues, and media campaigns to foster national unity. The United States and other Western countries also have a role to play. By emphasizing the importance of religious freedom in their diplomatic efforts, they can encourage Egypt to take meaningful steps toward reform. This could include offering incentives for progress, such as increased economic aid or trade opportunities and technical assistance to help Egypt develop a more inclusive legal framework. Religious freedom is not just a moral imperative; it’s a cornerstone for stability and prosperity. Egypt can become a beacon of religious tolerance in the Middle East, but only if it chooses a path of reform and inclusion. By embracing religious freedom, Egypt can unlock a brighter future for all its citizens and pave the way for a more stable and prosperous region.",

    "text": "Schefter: Browns' Amari Cooper (heel) now inactive for Week 17 The Cleveland Browns have ruled out Amari Cooper (heel) for Thursday's Week 17 game against the New York Jets. Cooper appeared to be trending in the right direction for tonight's game against the Jets' elite defense, but evidently wasn't able to do enough in the team's pregame warmups to suit up for the game. He'll take the weekend off to recover as the Browns gear up for playoff push. Cooper's absence could lead to even more targets for tight end David Njoku, but also for wideouts Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman. Njoku should be the top priority for the Browns' passing game, and has a $6,600 salary to go with his 9.2-FanDuel-point projection.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Astrônomos alertam sobre poluição luminosa de projeto energético perto de telescópios no Chile\nO Observatório Europeu do Sul (ESO, na sigla em inglês) alertou nesta quinta-feira (9) sobre a ameaça que poderia representar para o funcionamento do observatório Paranal, no norte do Chile, a construção de um projeto para produzir hidrogênio e amoníaco verdes, devido à poluição luminosa.\nOs cientistas acenderam o alerta diante do início da tramitação ambiental de um \"megaprojeto\" para produzir hidrogênio e amoníaco verdes por parte da empresa chilena AES Andes.\nÉ + que streaming. É arte, cultura e história.\nO projeto estaria localizado em Taltal, na região de Antofagasta, a entre cinco e 11 quilômetros de distância de Paranal, que abriga o Very Large Telescope, um dos instrumentos óticos mais poderosos do mundo. Junto dele está sendo construído o Extremely Large Telescope, com capacidade ainda maior.\n\"As emissões de poeira durante a construção, o aumento da turbulência atmosférica e, especialmente, a poluição luminosa, terão um impacto irreparável nas capacidades de observação astronômica\", advertiu o diretor-geral do ESO, Xavier Barcons, em comunicado.\nParanal foi inaugurado em 1999 e fica em pleno deserto de Atacama, o mais árido do mundo e lugar ideal para a observação astronômica por seu clima seco, grande altitude e ausência de nuvens e chuva.\nO complexo é parte da rede de observatórios astronômicos que estão situados no Chile, entre eles o radiotelescópio Alma e o telescópio ótico de La Silla.\nNo fim de dezembro, a companhia AES Andes informou que o projeto inclui \"a produção de hidrogênio e amoníaco verde, bem como o desenvolvimento de energia solar, eólica e de armazenamento em baterias\", em linha com o objetivo do Chile de ampliar a origem renovável de sua matriz energética.\nA AES Andes foi procurada pela AFP, mas não fez comentários.\nPara Itziar de Gregorio, representante do ESO no Chile, \"é crucial considerar localidades alternativas para este megaprojeto que não coloquem em perigo um dos tesouros astronômicos mais importantes do mundo\".\nEm outubro de 2024, entrou em vigor no Chile uma nova regra de luminosidade para proteger lugares próximos aos observatórios, mas também a saúde de pessoas e animais.\nA normativa estabelece limites de luminosidade, horários máximos de funcionamento de telões publicitários, além de promover a transição para o uso de luz quente, que produz menos luminosidade.\npa/atm/rpr\n[Fale com a gente](https://www.opovo.com.br/falecomagente)",

    "title": "Invito a uno sciopero di tutti i sindacati rappresentativi il 5 dicembre per i salari",
    "text": "Un intersindacato ha indetto uno sciopero salariale per giovedì 5 dicembre in “tutte le aziende del settore dell'elettricità e del gas”, abbiamo appreso venerdì da fonti sindacali. Questo appello arriva mentre le trattative salariali sono iniziate nelle aziende e “non sono al livello” delle rivendicazioni intersindacali (CGT/CFE-CGC/CFDT/FO), ha indicato una fonte sindacale.\nNel settore dell'elettricità e del gas, gli aumenti generali vengono decisi a livello di settore e si applicano a tutte le aziende, che poi negoziano una serie di aumenti individuali, la cui somma dà l'aumento complessivo dei dipendenti.\nTrattative non di livello\n“In aumento generale siamo a +0,8% […]. Nelle imprese, tutte e quattro le organizzazioni sindacali rappresentative del settore hanno chiesto il 2,3% in misure individuali, ha dichiarato all'AFP Laurent Koessler, responsabile del dialogo sociale di CFE-Energie, la seconda più grande organizzazione del settore, che conta poco meno di 140.000 dipendenti.\nTuttavia “le trattative commerciali sono iniziate e non siamo a questo livello”, ha aggiunto. “Dopo l'apertura delle trattative sulle misure salariali 2025, la prima proposta della direzione dell'EDF è un tasso basso dell'1,5%”, indica l'intersindacato in un volantino.\nLo stesso giorno del servizio civile\nChiede al management di “tornare ai negoziati proponendo molto di più per soddisfare il 2,3% richiesto per le singole misure”. Per gli stessi motivi, l'intersindacato chiede uno sciopero “alla EDF, alla Enedis e a tutte le imprese del settore dell'elettricità e del gas, affinché non vi sia una sola azienda che sfugga all'avviso di sciopero”, ha aggiunto Laurent Koessler, informazioni confermate dalla CGT di EDF e dalla CGT di GRDF.\nLa data del 5 dicembre corrisponde ad una riunione prevista dell'ente del settore energetico per negoziare altri temi, ha indicato Laurent Koessler. Questo giorno è “lo stesso giorno” dello sciopero nel servizio pubblico, ha sottolineato, con richieste di potere d'acquisto “quasi identiche”.\nUn movimento destinato a indurirsi?\nLa convocazione allo sciopero inizia ufficialmente il giorno prima alle 21, per i turni notturni, come da tradizione nel settore energetico. Questa giornata di sciopero non dovrebbe avere conseguenze troppo visibili per l'opinione pubblica, prevede Laurent Koessler, e dovrebbe soprattutto tradursi in una perdita di guadagni per le aziende.\nMa, avverte, “è in funzione del risultato”, quindi della mobilitazione, “e delle reazioni dei datori di lavoro”, che il movimento, che può rinnovarsi, alla fine potrà irrigidirsi. “L'intersindacato si riunirà la sera del 5 per decidere le azioni da intraprendere”, ha concluso.",
