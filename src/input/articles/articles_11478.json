    "title": "Sri Lanka embarks on Society 5.0 Journey: CSSL introduces bold vision at National ITC Conference",
    "text": "Reply To:\nName - Reply Comment\nThe National Information Technology Conference (NITC) 2024, hosted by the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL), marked a pivotal moment in Sri Lanka’s digital journey.\nUnder the theme “Catalyzing a Progressive Future: Towards Society 5.0,” the event introduced the transformative concept of Society 5.0 to the nation —a vision that integrates advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and Big Data into every facet of society. Originating in Japan, Society 5.0 aims to balance technological progress with social inclusivity and sustainability, providing a pathway for Sri Lanka to overcome its unique challenges while positioning itself as a regional leader in digital innovation.\nThe conference unfolded at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo on November 24, 25 and 26, brought together nearly 2000 policymakers, industry leaders, academics, and tech innovators, sparking dialogue on how Sri Lanka could adapt Society 5.0 to foster sustainable economic growth, improve societal well-being, and bridge the urban-rural divide. The CSSL’s initiative highlighted the importance of leveraging technology to create a human-centric society where technology serves the people, addressing national challenges while propelling the country toward a resilient and inclusive future.\nDr. Ajantha Atukorale, President of CSSL, emphasized the significance of this step for Sri Lanka. “As a nation poised for economic recovery and digital transformation, Society 5.0 offers us a roadmap to tackle critical challenges while enhancing the quality of life for every Sri Lankan. By seamlessly integrating technology into society, we can create a future that is not only innovative but also inclusive and sustainable,” he stated during his keynote address. His words set the tone for the conference, highlighting the potential of Society 5.0 to be a transformative force for Sri Lanka’s economic and social landscape.\nSri Lanka is at a crossroads, facing pressing challenges such as regional disparities, workforce concerns stemming from an aging population, the need for post-crisis economic recovery, and the imperative to achieve global competitiveness. Society 5.0, as envisioned at NITC 2024, offers a robust framework to address these challenges. It provides solutions that transcend traditional economic and technological approaches, emphasizing the seamless integration of the cyber and physical worlds to create a smart, sustainable society.\nThe economic impact of Society 5.0 could be profound. Industries such as manufacturing and agriculturepillars of Sri Lanka’s economystand to benefit significantly from automation, precision farming, and AI-driven analytics. These technologies can optimize production processes, reduce waste, and increase yields, ensuring Sri Lanka’s competitiveness in global markets.\nMoreover, the emphasis on digital transformation offers unparalleled opportunities for the country’s thriving MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) sector. These enterprises, which form the backbone of Sri Lanka’s economy, could leverage digital tools, cloud platforms, and global e-commerce channels to scale their operations and build resilience against market uncertainties.\nBeyond economic growth, Society 5.0 promises to address deeprooted social challenges. Regional disparities, for instance, remain a significant barrier to Sri Lanka’s equitable development. By enhancing Internet connectivity and implementing smart infrastructure, digital transformation can bring essential servicessuch as education, healthcare, and financial servicesto underserved regions. This would not only empower rural communities but also create new economic opportunities across the country.\nAnother pressing issue is Sri Lanka’s aging population, which poses challenges to its workforce and healthcare systems. Society 5.0 offers innovative solutions, including AI-driven healthcare diagnostics, telemedicine, and robotic assistance, to improve the quality and accessibility of care. Such technologies could ensure that older citizens receive the support they need while alleviating the strain on Sri Lanka’s healthcare infrastructure.\nDuring the conference, CSSL highlighted several critical areas that require immediate attention to successfully transition into a Society 5.0 framework. Chief among these is the need for collaborative policy development. Dr. Atukorale called for joint efforts between the government, private sector, academia, and international stakeholders to establish policies that foster innovation, ethical AI use, and inclusivity. “To realize the potential of Society 5.0, we must create an ecosystem where innovation thrives and technology is accessible to all,” he remarked and suggested recognizing ICT Sector as an Industry by the relevant authorities.\nDr Atukorale also suggested establishing a Chartered Institution to recognize ICT Professionalsas capacity building emerged as another focal point. As technology continues to evolve, equipping Sri Lanka’s workforce with future-ready skills is essential. Initiatives to upskill youth, professionals, and entrepreneurs in digital technologies could ensure a smooth transition and prepare the population for the jobs of tomorrow. These efforts, combined with investments in advanced digital infrastructure such as 5G, IoT networks, and cloud platforms, were identified as vital enablers for Society 5.0.\nSustainability and green technology also featured prominently in the discussions. Society 5.0 aligns closely with Sri Lanka’s commitment to global climate goals. Technologies like smart grids, renewable energy systems, and efficient waste management align with the country’s green initiatives and could play a critical role in reducing environmental impact while supporting sustainable economic growth.\nCybersecurity and ethical technology use were also emphasized as foundational elements of Society 5.0. “As we embrace Society 5.0, cybersecurity and ethical use of technology must be top priorities. It is our responsibility to ensure these technologies are used for the betterment of all citizens while protecting their privacy and data,” stated Udesh I. W. Seneviratna, the conference chair.\nHe also underscored the importance of fostering public trust in technology, which is critical for the successful adoption of Society 5.0. “As Sri Lanka embarks on a pivotal technological transformation, the theme “Catalyzing a Progressive Future: Towards Society 5.0” resonates deeply with our national aspirations since society 5.0, a visionary concept from Japan, aims to create a human-centered society that harmonizes economic growth with social problem solving through the seamless integration of cyberspace and physical space. For Sri Lanka, this theme represents not just an ideal but a practical road map for overcoming current challenges and fostering sustainable development” he further remarked.\nThe Ministry of Digital Economy, Deputy Minister Eng. Eranga Udesh Weeraratne, echoed this sentiment. “The government is committed to creating an environment where innovation and technology can thrive. Society 5.0 is not just about adopting technology; it’s about building a smarter, more equitable Sri Lanka. Through public-private partnerships and policy support, we aim to foster an ecosystem that drives economic growth and societal well-being,and for this a dedicated Digital Economic Authority will be formed” he remarked.\nThe NITC 2024 conference also explored the potential of Society 5.0 to transform Sri Lanka’s tourism sector. As one of the country’s key revenue generators, tourism could benefit significantly from smart technologies. Personalized travel experiences, efficient heritage site management, and eco-tourism initiatives could enhance Sri Lanka’s appeal to global travelers while ensuring sustainable practices.\nAs the conference concluded, the discussions underscored the importance of collaboration in realizing this ambitious vision. CSSL’s leadership in introducing Society 5.0 positions it as a key player in steering Sri Lanka toward a smarter, more connected future. By fostering innovation, bridging regional disparities, and addressing pressing social challenges, Society 5.0 offers a transformative pathway for Sri Lanka to emerge as a leader in digital innovation and sustainable development.\nThe NITC 2024 reinforced its role as a platform for groundbreaking ideas and strategic initiatives. The focus on Society 5.0 this year was a call to action for all stakeholders:government, industry, academia, and civil societyto work together in shaping a nation that is ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.\nThe vision of Society 5.0 is not merely about technology; it is about reimagining how technology can serve humanity. For Sri Lanka, this is a chance to innovate, rebuild, and thrive in an interconnected and inclusive global community. As CSSL continues to champion this transformation, the future of Sri Lanka as a smart, sustainable society looks brighter than ever.",

    "text": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's\neditorial process\nand policies.\nEditors have highlighted\nthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\nfact-checked\npeer-reviewed publication\ntrusted source\nproofread\nKey mechanism governing bone marrow stem cells opens door to new therapies\nA key mechanism controlling how bone marrow stem cells work has been revealed in a new study, shining a light on the principles of stem cell biology and opening the door to new therapeutic pathways.\nEric So, Professor and Chair in Leukaemia Biology in the Comprehensive Cancer Centre, and his lab identified two molecules that control when bone marrow stem cells rest and recover, and when they spring into action and replicate. The researchers subsequently discovered an enzyme that mediates the functions of these molecules. Since bone marrow stem cell transplantation has been the key treatment for a large array of blood cancers, their findings open the door to a new pathway for their future therapeutics.\nThe research is\npublished in the Blood Journal.\n\"Given the critical functions of stem cells in bone marrow transplant and cancer biology, identification of a new druggable pathway not only will help to better understand the stem cell biology but also facilitates the development of more effective therapeutics in the future,\" said So.\nLife-long replenishment for the blood system is dependent on\nhematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), a rare population of self-renewing stem cells that mainly live in bone marrow. HSCs are key, because when needed, they can turn into different blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.\nHSCs have two statuses: inactive and active. When they are inactive, a status also known as quiescent, they are protected from environmental stressors and are able to rest, preventing exhaustion. However, inactive HSCs must become active again to replicate themselves to replenish the blood system in response to problems such as infection,\nblood loss and other complications.\nThere is a sophisticated and delicate balance to keeping stem cells inactive and protected, but at the same time also allow them to respond to stress when needed and replicate themselves. This balance plays a key role for\nbone marrow transplantation—a life-saving procedure for various devastating diseases such as cancer. Similarly, the balance is also critical for cancer stem cells that sustain the disease and cause relapse. It is therefore critical to understand this process in order to design better treatments.\nIn the study, Professor So and his team found that two important molecules, namely Hoxa9 and b-catenin, work closely together to safeguard both these features in controlling the inactive and active statuses of HSCs. The team learned that one molecule is able to compensate for the other when it is inactive, providing a resilient system to protect our blood production.\nThese findings already help researchers understand to a greater extent the key principles involved in stem cell biology. However, Professor So and his lab subsequently identified a\ncritical enzyme named PRMT1 which mediates the function of Hoxa9 and b-catenin. Doctors already possess the ability to modulate PRMT1 in clinics, which means that understanding this biological process could provide new avenues for the development of efficient stem cell therapeutics.\nMore information:\nJennifer Lynch et al, Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and DNA replication dynamics maintained by the resilient β-catenin/Hoxa9/Prmt1 axis, Blood Journal (2024).\nDOI: 10.1182/blood.2023022082\nBlood []http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/ King's College London []http://www.kcl.ac.uk/",
