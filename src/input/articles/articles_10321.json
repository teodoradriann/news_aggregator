    "text": "Assisted stretching is a wellness concept that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It involves the use of a trainer to aid individuals in enhancing muscle flexibility and expanding their range of motion through stretching their muscles. [Projections](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/11/health/assisted-stretching-improve-flexibility-wellness/index.html) indicate substantial growth in the global stretching machines market, with an expected value of nearly $1 billion by 2027. The market is set to grow at an annual rate of 4.7% from 2020 to 2027, underscoring an increasing awareness of and appreciation for the advantages associated with consistent stretching and flexibility training. This heightened demand reflects a broader acknowledgment of the integral role these practices play in overall well-being. Why Do We Need to Stretch? Maintaining muscle flexibility, strength, and overall health through regular stretching is crucial for preserving musculoskeletal mobility. When muscles lack flexibility, they tend to shorten and tighten, resulting in weakness and an inability to fully extend during physical activity. This increases the risk of joint pain, strains, and muscle damage. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0263.htm) (CDC) estimates that on average, Americans spend over half (55%) of their day sitting down. Prolonged periods of sitting, such as in a chair all day or on a couch, can lead to tight leg muscles, restricting leg extension and hindering proper knee movement, which can lead to impaired walking. When tight muscles are suddenly subjected to high-impact activities like running or weight lifting, abrupt stretching can cause damage and injured muscles may not provide adequate joint support, heightening the risk of joint injuries. That’s why consistent stretching, coincided with regular exercise, is key to promoting healthy and flexible muscles, preventing excessive force on the muscles during exertion. The Cooperative Relationship Between Wellness Concepts and Medical Practices The relationship between wellness concepts, such as assisted stretching, and medical practices being symbiotic is becoming increasingly apparent. More and more people are recognizing the importance of preventative healthcare practices and are willing to invest in services that contribute to their overall well-being. As this trend continues, it is likely that the healthcare landscape will witness an increase in the number of medical professionals who are leveraging their expertise to introduce innovative wellness solutions within their communities. The evolving paradigm underscores a collective recognition of the fundamental connection between holistic well-being and medical care, paving the way for a more comprehensive approach to health in the future. Assisted Stretching as a Proactive Approach to Maintaining Physical Health Engaging in regular stretching routines plays a pivotal role in enhancing musculoskeletal health and there is strong evidence suggesting it’s connected with preventing injuries and falls. This proactive health strategy not only helps individuals maintain overall physical well-being but also serves as a preventive measure against chronic conditions associated with poor flexibility and mobility. The challenge, however, lies in ensuring correct stretching techniques without proper guidance. This gap has led orthopedic experts to endorse innovative wellness concepts, such as assisted stretching, as complementary to traditional medical care. The Future of Wellness-Integrated Healthcare [StretchLab](http://www.stretchlab.com), a key player in the assisted stretching space offering one-on-one and group assisted stretching sessions, is one such wellness studio. With a mission to promote flexibility, mobility, and overall well-being, StretchLab attests that regular stretching can help individuals improve their posture, reduce muscle tension, and enhance their overall physical performance. The studio offers a variety of stretching routines that are tailored to the individual needs and fitness levels of their clients. The evolving landscape of healthcare recognizes the importance of holistic approaches to health and well-being and concepts like StretchLab may become standard offerings in comprehensive healthcare plans in the future. By incorporating assisted stretching into their wellness routines, individuals can maintain optimal health and maintain and even improve mobility in the long run.

    "text": "Supersport turns spoilsport for team India The India skipper struggled to find positives with the match ending inside three days CENTURION: India skipper Rohit Sharma had no qualms about admitting that his team was simply not good enough to challenge South Africa, putting the blame for the embarrassing innings and 32 run loss in the first Test on the lack of collective effort. “We were not good enough to win. Having been put in to bat, KL (Rahul) batted well to get us that score but then we didn’t exploit the conditions with the ball and then again didn’t show up today (Thursday) with the bat,” said Rohit during the post-match presentation. “If we have to win Test matches, we have to come together collectively and we didn’t do that. Guys have come here before, we know what to expect and everyone has their own plan. “Our batters were challenged and we didn’t adapt well. This is a boundary-scoring ground, we saw them score many but we need to understand the opposition and their strengths as well. We didn’t bat well in both innings, that’s why we stand here.” The India skipper struggled to find positives with the match ending inside three days. “Not too many positives to finish the game within three days, but KL showed what we need to do on this sort of pitch,” he said. KL Rahul had scored a century in the first innings. “Our bowlers, a lot of these guys haven’t been here before so I don’t want to be too critical. “Important for us to regroup, we go through these times as sportsmen and we need to be ready for the next Test now.” Playing his last international series, Dean Elgar slammed a magnificent 185 and the opener termed it a “special” knock and highlighted his partnerships with Tony de Zorzi (28) and Marco Jansen (84). “Pretty special knock. Sometimes what we want to do hasn’t worked out as plans, but happy that it worked. I think you need to keep things nice and simple, the game is already pretty complex,” said the 36-year-old, who was adjudged the Player of the Match. “Focus on the ball, play nice and straight. Play late and be great. You got to ride the roller when it is in your favour. “Good partnerships with Tony, and then Jansen showed his talent as well. You need fast bowlers and a spinner potentially to take 20 wickets, that’s how we win Test matches.” Proteas pace trio of Nandre Burger (4/33), Kagiso Rabada (2/32) and Marco Jansen (3/36) smothered the visitor with a disciplined attack as India folded for 131 in 34.1 overs. “(Rabada) KG was brilliant, but then Nandre showed why he has been such a shining light for South African cricket,” Elgar said. “You can’t win a two-Test series if you don’t win the first one, the Indians are difficult to beat. “We’ll have a few days out to relax and enjoy this. We were pretty clinical, our fielding wasn’t the best and we didn’t make it too easy for ourselves at times.”",

    "text": "Pelo menos 1,9 milhões de pessoas foram afetadas pelas fortes chuvas que atingem especialmente o estado do Rio Grande do Sul, que provocaram também 114 mortes, anunciaram hoje autoridades brasileiras\nSegundo o último balanço divulgado pela Defesa Civil do Rio Grande do Sul, 113 pessoas morreram devido às inundações e deslizamentos de terra provocados pelas tempestades no estado. Outra vítima mortal foi registada no estado de Santa Catarina. O balanço anterior apontava para 108 mortos.\nAs autoridades do Rio Grande do Sul contabilizam ainda 146 desaparecidos e 756 feridos nos 435 municípios afetados, que registam também 69,6 mil pessoas em abrigos e pelo menos 337 mil desalojados.\nAo todo, segundo as autoridades locais, mais de 70 mil pessoas foram resgatadas nas áreas afetadas, incluindo ainda quase 10 mil animais.\nO Alto-Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Refugiados (ACNUR) alertou hoje que as inundações causadas pelas tempestades no sul do Brasil afetaram pelo menos 41 mil refugiados que vivem no Rio Grande do Sul, muitos deles provenientes da Venezuela e do Haiti.\n“Muitos venezuelanos e haitianos vivem em áreas afetadas que só podem ser alcançadas por barco”, disse o porta-voz do ACNUR, William Spindler, numa conferência de imprensa em Genebra.\nSegundo a mesma fonte, o Rio Grande do Sul acolhe mais de 21 mil venezuelanos realocados do estado de Roraima, na fronteira norte do país com a Venezuela e que recebe o maior número de refugiados.\nChuvas torrenciais atingem o sul do Brasil desde segunda-feira da semana passada e continuaram nos dias seguintes, causando grandes danos a estradas, pontes, residências e deixando grande parte da população sem luz nem água potável.\nCom 11 milhões de habitantes, o Rio Grande do Sul tem sido bastante afetado pelas mudanças climáticas. Depois de ser afetado com uma forte seca devido ao fenómeno La Niña, no ano passado a região passou a ser afetada pelo El Niño e registou, em menos de 12 meses, quatro desastres climáticos causados por ciclones extratropicais e tempestades.\nEm 2023, três desastres naturais ocorreram em junho, setembro e novembro, causando 75 mortos neste estado brasileiro.",

    "title": "Liderazgos femeninos que transforman la realidad del país",
    "text": "La voluntad de las mujeres puede cambiar realidades, como lo han logrado múltiples colombianas que hoy se destacan como lideresas. EL TIEMPO, junto a la Fundación Cardio Infantil y la empresa Arcos Dorados, reunió a siete empresarias, activistas y profesionales de diferentes campos. Las mujeres, abanderadas de diferentes sectores económicos y sociales, conversaron en el foro Lideresas para el Cambio, en el espacio Tiempo de Mujer. Piedad Urdinola Contreras, directora del Dane, María Inés Salamanca Vidak, representante adjunta de ONU Mujeres en Colombia, y María Fernanda García Martínez, consultora de operaciones y líder de la Red de Mujeres de Arcos Dorados, abrieron el primer espacio. En el segundo segmento dialogaron Karen Alexandra Dueñas Criado, cardióloga de la Fundación Cardio Infantil, María del Campo, la imagen de la cacaocultura colombiana (su nombre es Liliana Jiménez Molina), Nadia Sánchez Gómez, fundadora de She Is y ganadora del premio Mujer Cafam 2024, y Ximena González, directora ejecutiva de la Asociación Cultural Femenina (ACF). Desde el 2002, el Departamento de Administración Nacional de Estadística (Dane) no había sido dirigido por una mujer. 20 años después, en septiembre del 2022, esto cambió cuando Piedad Urdinola Contreras fue nombrada como la directora de la institución encargada de generar y analizar las cifras del país. Urdinola considera que una sociedad inequitativa no tiene mucho futuro y que “los datos son la puerta de entrada a los derechos”. La directora del Dane señaló que hay dos situaciones que le generan preocupación. La primera, la existencia de niñas que son mamás a los 10 años. Aunque la ley determina que acceder carnalmente a un menor de 14 años es un delito, el Dane ha registrado que algunas de estas niñas se encuentran transitando su segundo embarazo. La segunda situación preocupante es la persistencia del trabajo doméstico no remunerado para las mujeres. “Ese es el nudo de todas las brechas sociales y es histórico. No existe un país en el mundo donde el trabajo doméstico no remunerado sea equitativo”, señaló Urdinola, quien también resaltó que actualmente la entidad tiene paridad de género en sus cargos técnicos (hay más del 50 por ciento de mujeres en estos puestos). Por su parte, la representante adjunta de ONU Mujeres Colombia, María Inés Salamanca, resaltó que ningún país ha resuelto la violencia basada en género y que no hay ninguna mujer que no haya vivido situaciones de violencia. “Los datos nos han permitido demostrar que hay diversidad de mujeres y desde ahí podemos hablar de interseccionalidad en la violencia de género. Los hechos victimizantes que puede vivir una mujer blanca en Bogotá son distintos a los que pueden afectar a una mujer en el Pacífico”, enfatizó Salamanca. Las cifras de Naciones Unidas, tras varios estudios, señalan que la sociedad se tomará 300 años para alcanzar la igualdad de género, sin embargo, tener acciones contra la violencia y la desigualdad pueden reducir esta cifra. Para Salamanca, invertir en una sociedad de ciudados mejoraría las condiciones de vida de las mujeres y los hombres. Cada una de estas mujeres tiene una historia especial. Por su parte, Nadia Sánchez —recientemente galardonada— comentó que su fundación ha llevado a 715 niñas víctimas del conflicto armado a la Nasa, mediante el programa ‘Ella es Astronauta’, de las cuales 31 se encuentran cursando estudios universitarios. “Me lancé sin miedo, nunca desvié mi objetivo ni permití que un no me frenará. La puerta que se abría, yo la convertía en mi ventana al mundo, porque casi todas las puertas se cerraron al principio”, señaló Nadia sobre lo difícil que fue iniciar. También resaltó la importancia de estructurar y planificar acciones para que los sueños se cumplan. Sánchez señala que cuando una niña en condiciones de vulnerabilidad recibe una oportunidad, se logra transformar su territorio. Al respecto, la directora ejecutiva de la ACF, Ximena González, dijo que impactar positivamente la vida de una mujer, transforma a la sociedad. “Es un reto lograr que las empresas y las personas comprendan la importancia de apoyar proyectos. No tenemos como país la cultura de la donación, pero sí hay empresas —de múltiples sectores—, así como comunidad internacional y organizaciones, que impulsan estas iniciativas”, expresó González sobre la sostenibilidad de los proyectos sociales. González resaltó la alianza que hizo la Asociación Cultural Femenina con Sisco, una empresa que ofrece servicios de tecnología corporativa. A su vez, María Fernanda García, consultora de operaciones de Arcos Dorado (una de las cadenas alimenticias más grandes a nivel mundial), indicó que los techos de cristal se pueden romper teniendo autonomía económica y crecimiento profesional desde la educación. La también líder de la Red de Mujeres de la conocida cadena alimenticia se empleó allí hace 28 años como cajera de uno de los restaurantes de la franquicia. Y, para María del Campo, representar a Colombia en el sector productivo del cacao fue un reto incalculable. Ella es la embajadora de 65.000 familias cacaocultoras del país, con una presencia que resignifica a la mujer cultivadora en escenarios internacionales. “María ha sido interseccional, porque cuando estamos en el campo colombiano nos encontramos con realidades complejas que viven las mujeres. Hay mucho por sanar en ellas y situaciones que se deben superar. No solo en lo productivo, también en lo psicosocial”, señaló Liliana sobre el personaje que ahora le da la vuelta al mundo: María del Campo. La voz de la Fundación Cardioinfantil estuvo en las manos de la doctora Karen Dueñas, cardióloga y una de las mujeres expertas a nivel regional en esta área de la medicina. Ella explicó que uno de los mitos en salud, que tienen las mujeres, es considerar que se puede ser más propensa a morir por cáncer de mama y enfermedades ginecológicas. Sin embargo, mientras que 1 de cada 30 mujeres muere por cáncer de mama, en Colombia, 1 de 4 mujeres pierde la vida por enfermedades cardiovasculares. Por ello, la especialista invitó a las personas a “conocer sus números”, es decir, comprender qué significa su diagnóstico médico y cuidarse. La Fundación Cardioinfantil cuenta con la última tecnología para atender esas patologías y ha mapeado el por qué este tipo de dolencias tiene una especial significación para las mujeres, que para los hombres.",

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | Swindon Advertiser",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
