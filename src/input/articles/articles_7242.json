So those two divisions are sert.\nThe Ravens can clinch the AFC North tonight, if the Browns lose to the Jets.\nThe Dolphins would clinch the AFC East if they beat the Ravens on Sunday.\nThe Chiefs would clinch the AFC West if they beat the Bengals on Sunday.\nThe Jaguars would clinch the AFC South if they beat Panthers, the Texans lose to the Titans and the Colts lose to the Raiders on Sunday.\nThe Eagles would clinch the NFC East if the Cowboys lose to the Lions on Saturday and the Eagles beat the Cardinals on Sunday.\nAnd the Buccaneers would clinch the NFC South if they beat the Saints on Sunday.\nIf that’s the way Week 17 plays out, Week 18 won’t have any division titles still alive. But it wouldn’t mean the top teams are resting their starters in the final game of the season. In the above scenario, the No. 1 seed would not be clinched in either conference (the Ravens and Dolphins would both be in contention in the AFC, while the 49ers, Lions and Eagles would all be in contention in the NFC). And multiple wild card spots would still be up for grabs. So Week 18 will still have plenty of intrigue, even if Week 17 is the end of all eight division races.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "New Jersey uses 3 times amount of plastic after plastic ban: Report",
    "text": "Plastic consumption in New Jersey tripled despite the state's 2022 plastic ban meant to and address the \"problem of plastic pollution,\" according to a study from a business-research firm. The study found that the state's law banning single-use plastic bags led to a 60% decrease in the total bag volume, according to analysis from the Freedonia Report, MarketResearch.com's business research division. However, as consumers started searching for alternatives and purchasing plastic reusable bags, the state saw plastic consumption triple, largely because of the material used in the alternative bags, the report shows. \"Most of these alternative bags are made with non-woven polypropylene, which is not widely recycled in the United States and does not typically contain any post-consumer recycled materials,\" the report states. The ban, which took effect in May 2022, prevented large retailers, groceries and food service stores from distributing the plastic bags, reports Fox29. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, upon signing the bill, said the measure would address New Jersey's \"most problematic forms of garbage\" and \"help mitigate climate change and strengthen our environment for future generations,\" Stores eliminate plastics bags: Aldi eliminates plastic shopping bags in all 2,300 US grocery stores The ban also affected retailers, with some stories reporting an increase in sales because of the need for alternative bags. \"An in-depth cost analysis evaluating New Jersey grocery retailers reveals a typical store can profit $200,000 per store location from alternative bag sales,\" states the study. \"For one major retailer, this amounts to an estimated $42 million in profit across all its bag sales in NJ.\" Single-use plastic bans are a way to curb the pollution and emissions created by the production of the material, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But, the search for alternatives to carry groceries and other products from the store leads to the purchase of products that increase the pollution caused by manufacturings the bags. A study published by Environmental and Resource Economics also suggests that plastic bag bans can lead to an increase in purchases of garbage bags. \"We estimate that [carryout grocery bag] regulations lead to an average increase in purchased plastics of 127 pounds per store per month,\" states the study.",

Read our [disclosure policy here](/privacy-disclosure).\nLearn how to make a delicious stack of butternut squash pancakes with this simple recipe & the shortcuts that make it even easier.\nButternut Squash Pancakes with Oat Flour\nI first made this recipe for butternut squash pancakes with oat flour when I had extra roasted butternut squash from dinner and decided to use it swapping the canned pumpkin in my healthy pumpkin pancakes recipe.\nI wish I could tell you they were a huge success with the family -they were a total flop because I forgot to rinse the seasoning first. I’ve learned my lesson, and now I steam the butternut squash in the microwave and add them to the blender with the oats, and they’re epic. I’ll show you all my tricks below.\nIngredients\nThe ingredients for these butternut squash pancakes are listed with the amounts in the recipe card, but before you make any swaps and they flop here are some of my notes on them:\n- Milk: dairy or dairy-free milk will work. If using\noat milk for pancakes, add a tablespoon or two extra since it’s thicker. - Eggs: they’ll bind the ingredients and help the pancakes hold together. Using an egg replacer will often yield moist pancakes that can feel undercooked.\n- Butternut squash: you’ll need 1 cup of pureed squash, which is about 16 ounces of cooked and steamed cubes.\n- Oats: I recommend using old-fashioned rolled oats for this recipe. If you use quick-cooking oats, add an additional 2 tablespoons to thicken up the batter.\n- Baking powder: these react with heat and give pancakes their fluffy texture, a necessity for this recipe.\n- Salt: to enhance the other flavors.\n- Brown sugar: just a little adds a touch of sweetness that pairs great with the squash flavors.\n- Cinnamon: an optional add-in you’ll love.\nUsing Baby Food Butternut Squash\nOne convenient way of making these pancakes is using butternut squash puree; however, the texture is much thinner than when blending cooked squash yourself, so you’ll need to add additional oats to the batter.\nCanned Butternut Squash Puree\nWhile difficult to find, it exists! Canned butternut squash puree has a similar texture to pumpkin puree, which you can also swap in this recipe for the same amount.\nHow to Make Butternut Squash Pancakes\nThese pancakes come together really fast with the help of the blender! Some tips in the steps that ensure you don’t get any undercooked middles, a common pancake issue with this recipe, include:\n- Make the butternut squash puree\nThe butternut squash needs to be cooked first before turning it into a smooth puree, which is easy to make in a blender orfood processor. Let it cool down slightly before making the batter. - Make the pancake batter\nThe blender combines the ingredients and blends the oats seamlessly to create a smooth batter. It will be thick but don’t worry. - Wait 5 minutes\nLetting the batter rest for 5 minutes allows for the oats to absorb the liquid in the batter before cooking, ensuring the pancakes cook through and don’t feel wet or under cooked. - Cook the pancakes\nYou want to start with a hot, non-stick surface. Once it’s hot, grease it well. I use a ¼ cup scoop to measure out the batter and then use the back (or a spoon) to spread the batter a little so the middles cook through. - Serve\nKeep the pancakes warmwhile you cook the rest and serve with your favoritepancake toppingsand syrup.\nWhat Does the Batter Look Like\nThe batter for these pancakes is thicker than traditional batter because of the oats which are added directly into the blender with the other ingredients. The blender breaks them apart and makes them part of the batter eliminating the need for oat flour.\nWhen to Flip Butternut Squash Pancakes\nThe first side should cook for about 2 minutes over medium to medium-high heat. When you see bubbles on the top and defined edges, it’s time to flip the pancakes. If your pancakes are burning, reduce the heat.\nMore Fall Pancake Recipes\nIf you’re into fall-inspired breakfasts, especially pancakes, you’re going to love my Pumpkin Spice Pancake recipe, these easy pecan pancakes, simple sweet potato pancakes, and this Banana Pumpkin Pancakes recipe.\nButternut Squash Pancakes with Oats\nIngredients\n- ½ cup butternut squash pureé\n- ¾ cup milk, any\n- 2 eggs\n- 2 cups old fashioned oats*\n- 1 tablespoon baking powder\n- 1 tablespoon brown sugar\n- ½ teaspoon cinnamon\n- ¼ teaspoon salt\nInstructions\nPrep\n- Make the puree with cooked butternut squash in a blender or food processor. Let it cool down to room temperature before making the batter.\nMake the pancake batter\n- Add the ingredients in the blender in the order listed, with the liquid ingredients at the bottom and the oats on top. Blend until the oat flakes are gone, and they’ve incorporated themselves into a thick, smooth batter.\n- Allow the batter to rest for 5 minutes before cooking the pancakes for the best texture.\nCook the pancakes\n- Heat a non-stick griddle or large pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, grease, spray, or melt butter on the hot surface. When using an electric griddle, heat it somewhere between 300 and 350F.\n- Immediately, pour ¼ cup of pancake batter onto the greased pan. Cook the pancakes for about 2 minutes, until the edges begin to look defined and bubbles form. Flip the pancakes over and cook for another minute on the other side. Don’t press them down with the spatula. Remove from the pan onto a plate and keep them warm while you cook the rest of the batter.\nServe\n- Stack them high and top them with a little butter, syrup, and your favorite pancake toppings.\nStore\n- Refrigerate unused batter in the blender covered for up to 2 days. Let it come to room temperature for 10 minutes before cooking. Refrigerate leftover pancakes for up to 3 days. Or, freeze for up to 3 months.\nNotes\nTo use quick-cooking oats, add an additional 2 tablespoons to thicken up the batter.\nThe texture of baby food butternut squash is much thinner than when blending cooked squash yourself, so you’ll need to add additional oats to the batter, about 2 tablespoons.",
