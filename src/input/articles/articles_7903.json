    "text": "The Agbogbomefia of Asogli State, Togbe Afede XIV has expressed grave concern about the afflictions caused by corrupt practices in Ghana.\nSpeaking at the ‘Anti-corruption Day’ event he held as part of activities to mark this year’s Yam Festival celebration at Ho in the Volta Region, the chief noted that corruption has also denied a large majority of Ghanaians the peace they deserve to enjoy.\nSpeaking at the event held on Wednesday, September 25, 2024, in his palace, Togbe said corruption in recent times has robbed Ghana of many good things and that the peace citizens desire cannot be found anymore.\n“All these things (corrupt practices) threaten our unity and our peace. We may seem to be enjoying peace but this is very much superficial and let’s remember that peace is not defined in terms of the absence of war, yes we’re not at war, but certainly, we don’t have the kind of peace we desire in our country, the kind of peace that our founding fathers had looked forward to in our country”.\nThe Chief also spoke about some practices that fuel corruption in the country.\nHe said, “The lack of respect for the truth in our country and the tribalization”. Too many questions are asked about where one comes from. In Nkrumah’s Ghana, we were all one people and that is what we all desire to have but unfortunately, tribalization has taken root in our country, and all of these things have made corruption possible”.\nThe businessman cum traditional leader vowed to continue speaking against corruption.\n“Our democracy, as we can all attest, has become an enterprise benefiting a few people. Ghana has become like an orphan child raped by the very people who have promised to take care of her” Togbe Afede said.\n“I have to express the hope that we can all join the fight against corruption” he added.\nThe Anti-corruption Day is observed as part of the annual Yam Festival celebration under the auspices of Togbe Afede XIV, to educate the public, especially young people on the impact of corruption and how to tackle it.",

    "title": "Former Auburn coaches believe Jarrett Stidham can handle new role with Broncos",
    "text": "Jarrett Stidham’s heroics as the Auburn starting quarterback in 2017 plays through Chip Lindsey’s mind as if it happened yesterday.\nIn three weeks, Lindsey — Auburn’s former offensive coordinator — watched Stidham perform what could be considered the unthinkable. First, he threw for three touchdowns in a 40-17 drubbing of top-ranked Georgia.\nTwo weeks later, with Alabama then No. 1 in the country, Stidham rushed 16 yards for a touchdown to solidify the Tigers’ 26-14 upset over the Crimson Tide in the Iron Bowl.\n“He pulled a run on a zone read and ran through a couple of tackles and willed us to a win,” Lindsey, now the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at North Carolina, told The Denver Post.\nNot too many college quarterbacks can say they beat Alabama and Georgia in the same season. When Stidham did so in his first season with the Tigers, it gave his coaches every indication he could be a starter in the NFL, and it offers hope that he could perform well as the Broncos’ new starting quarterback in place of Russell Wilson.\n“I think he’s got that special (ability) to perform at a high level in a situation like that,” former Auburn coach Gus Malzahn told The Post.\nEach win showcased a different ability from Stidham, who started two seasons with the Tigers. Against the Bulldogs, he showcased his toughness and willingness to stay in the pocket against pressured. While facing third down, Stidham watched two defenders close in before he tossed a screen pass to running back Kerryon Johnson for a 55-yard touchdown.\nStidham finished the game with 214 passing yards and a 69.6% completion percentage while rushing for a score.\nIn the win over the Crimson Tide, Stidham’s dual-threat ability was on display. He rushed for 51 yards on 12 carries while adding 237 yards in the air. What stood out to Lindsey the most was how Stidham handled himself on third down, as he helped the Tigers convert nine of their 18 attempts.\n“When you play those two teams, you gotta have a guy that (has) a lot of poise (under pressure). He did that,” Lindsey said.\nMalzahn, the current head coach at Central Florida, knew Stidham had the potential to be a special player. Coming out of Stephenville High School in Stephenville, Texas, Stidham was a five-star recruit and ranked the top dual-threat quarterback in the nation by 247sports.\nHe played one season at Baylor, totaling 1,265 yards and 12 touchdowns, and started three games as a true freshman in 2015. Stidham sat out in 2016 before transferring to Auburn. His physical attributes and ability to make every throw in the pocket fit with everything the Tigers were seeking in a starting quarterback.\n“You just knew he was going to be a real special player, and he had a skill set we were searching for. It was a real special match,” Malzahn said.\nKevin C. Cox, Getty Images Jarrett Stidham (8 )of the Auburn Tigers rushes the ball during the third quarter against the Alabama Crimson Tide at Jordan Hare Stadium on Nov. 25, 2017 in Auburn, Ala. For Malzahn and Lindsey, Stidham’s leadership ability stood out the moment he arrived at Auburn. He did a solid job carrying the coaches’ message to the players and wasn’t afraid to stand up and hold players accountable.\nLindsey said Stidham led in the right way and was never arrogant in his approach.\nRelated Articles Denver Broncos | WATCH: Jarrett Stidham finds Lil’Jordan Humphrey for electric 54-yard touchdown vs. Chargers Denver Broncos | How it happened: Jarrett Stidham, defense lead Broncos to Week 17 win over Chargers Denver Broncos | Kiszla: With good riddance to Mr. Let’s Ride, who can end Broncos’ long nightmare at quarterback?

Denver Broncos | NFL Picks: Ravens, Dolphins square off one week after impressive wins, plus the Browns are going to the postseason “For him to transfer into a program like Auburn and establish himself as the leader of the group, that’s hard to do,” Lindsey said. “These (recruiting) classes develop bonds. All of a sudden, here comes this quarterback and wins the job. I thought he assimilated into the team really well.”\nStidham, a fourth-round pick in 2019, has been a backup throughout his NFL career. When the Broncos signed Stidham in the offseason, head coach Sean Payton believed the former Patriots and Raiders signal-caller could be a starter.\nLindsey agrees as well. He said Stidham just needs the opportunity to prove it. Denver’s future at the quarterback position is unclear now that the franchise elected to bench Wilson in favor of Stidham. But the final two games might serve as an audition for Stidham to show that he can lead this team in the future.\n“There’s no doubt he can. He’s got the ability,” Malzahn said.\nWant more Broncos news?

    "text": "As the storm raged, Lewellen labored for over four hours before they embarked on a risky drive to Sarasota Memorial Hospital. Her mother drove them cautiously through heavy winds and rain. At the hospital, only Bennett was allowed to accompany her, leaving Lewellen to FaceTime with her mom, a source of strength and comfort for her. In the delivery room, Lewellen’s view of the hurricane was a surreal backdrop to the most intense moment of her life. As trees uprooted outside, the real storm came when she learned the baby was in the wrong position, requiring a cesarean section. In pain from epidural complications, she leaned on the hospital staff. “If I didn’t have the doctors and nurses that I had, it would have been a whole lot worse,” she said. Get your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more! At 11:45 p.m., amidst the storm, their son, Dewey Lester Bennett IV, was born—a healthy, 8-pound baby boy. It was a moment of overwhelming relief and joy. “He is a miracle baby,” Lewellen said, holding him close. The timing of Dewey’s birth, in the heart of a natural disaster, serves as a reminder of something greater. No matter how big the storms of life are—both literally and figuratively—God is always bigger. As Psalm 107:29 says, “He made the storm calm, and the sea waves were still. They were glad because the waters were quiet, so He brought them to their desired harbor.” Join Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!

    "text": "The United Liberation Front of Assam ( ULFA )'s pro-talks faction on Friday signed a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement pact with the Centre and the Assam government on Friday. The peace deal was inked by a 29-member delegation in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, The 29-member delegation of the ULFA 's pro-talks delegation, included 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society. Speaking on the peace deal, Amit Shah said it is a bright day for the future of Assam. “It is a matter of joy for me that today is a bright day for the future of Assam . For a long time, Assam, Northeast faced violence and after PM Modi became PM in 2014, efforts were made to reduce the gap between Delhi and Northeast…” said Shah. \"Assam has suffered for long due to the violence of the ULFA and 10,000 people lost their lives in this violence since 1979,\" he said. Shah also added that a big development package will be given to Assam as part of the accord. \"Every clause of the pact will be implemented fully,\" he said. The violence has come down in Assam by 87 per cent, deaths by 90 per cent and kidnappings by 84 per cent, added Shah. While Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said it is a historic day for the state. \"Today is a historic day for Assam. During PM Modi's tenure, under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, work for Assam's peace was always underway...three accords have been signed and with three accords tribal militancy has come to an end in Assam,” said Sarma. As an aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh, ULFA was formed in April 1979. It was split into two groups in February 2011. The Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction gave up violence and agreed for peace talks, while the Paresh Baruah-led ULFA-Independent faction is against any talks with the government. A peace accord was reached after 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction and the government. The peace pact is expected to end decades-old insurgency in Assam. Baruah, who is against any peace talks, is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border. ULFA was declared a banned outfit in 1990.",

    "text": "In a significant step forward in an ongoing commitment to enhancing sustainability and transparency in Canada’s agri-food sector, the National Index on Agri-Food Performance has entered a new phase with the launch of the Centre for Agri-Food Benchmarking. The Centre, housed at the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI), will accelerate and formalize the work of the unprecedented coalition of 137 partners supporting the National Index. This milestone builds upon the success of the Index pilot, the first agri-food sustainability index in Canada, launched in May 2023. The Index is being advanced by the coalition to respond to the global imperative to reduce emissions, address the crisis of climate change, and deliver on a breadth of sustainability expectants. Key points: Evolution from Index to Centre: The role of the Centre is to improve and publish the next version of the Index, representing a wholesale shift from a pilot to a more sustained, long-term approach. The Centre is committed to an initial four-year plan, developed in partnership with the coalition, to advance the mission of the Index. Long-Term Vision: The Centre commits to continuous improvement of the Index, deepening the understanding of the sector’s sustainability leadership, identifying areas for greater progress, and promoting the Index’s use across the sector. Doing so will increase the competitiveness of the sector domestically and internationally and be a tool to inform policy, research and innovation priorities, as well as help build greater societal trust. Unmatched Collaboration: This launch formalizes the unprecedented collaboration within the agri-food sector, receiving commitment and investment from a highly diverse coalition of partners to evolve the Index and accelerate its application in the marketplace. Global Imperative for Sustainability: The Index recognizes the need to improve sustainability from a holistic standpoint, focusing on, environmental, food integrity, economic and social well-being indicators. The Centre will enable, support, and showcase the sector’s sustainability efforts, helping advance Canada’s commitment to being a sustainable food producer. Executive Leadership: David McInnes, who founded and led the initiative since 2020, assumes the role of the first Executive Director of the Centre, an evolution from his previous position as National Coordinator of the Index. Permanent Home at CAPI: The Centre for Agri-Food Benchmarking will be housed at the Ottawa-based Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI), reinforcing CAPI’s evolving position as a pivotal player in advancing policy solutions within agriculture and food. Financial support is being provided under the Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership’s Agri-Assurance Program – National Industry Association Component. Financial and in-kind support is also provided by coalition partners.",

Henrietta, N.Y. — The Rush-Henrietta Central School District helped its students build new partnerships Friday, inviting local business leaders to a work industry breakfast and workshop. More than 80 representatives from businesses in Monroe County met with students to talk about ways they can have a successful future in a number of different industries. \"The biggest hope is for us to continue the conversation around how we can work interdependently to support each other, in terms of workforce development and economic development,\" said Barbara Mullen, superintendent of the Rush-Henrietta Central School District. \"I hope that industry leaders are able to meet with some wonderful youth, and that youth are able to learn in real time from business leaders, philanthropic leaders, and leaders in multiple different sectors and communities. (Hopefully), they'll be able to continue a partnership and chart a path forward.\" The event also included a discussion on the basic skills and qualities necessary to enter the workforce.",

    "title": "The enduring legacy of Lee-Enfield rifles",
    "text": "In the age of high-tech weaponry and ever-increasing defence budgets, the Lee-Enfield rifle stands out among sharpshooters for its price, precision and performance. Many militaries used it in the two World Wars and India's civil defence system once heavily relied on it.\nThe Lee-Enfield gets its name from the designer of the rifle's bolt system - James Paris Lee - and the location where it was designed, the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield, north of London.\nIt was originally introduced in the 0.303 calibre in the UK. The variants and calibre of the rifle have evolved since. Still, the name 'good old three-nought-three' has stuck and even the fundamental design endures.\nA gun aficionado in his 60s, well acquainted with the rifle since his days in the National Cadet Corps (NCC), points out that Lee-Enfields \"are extremely precise and effective for long-range shooting, for over 700 yards\". He adds: \"An AK-47's effective range is 380 yards. The Lee-Enfield was so precise and reliable that a sniper variant of the gun was also developed with a mounted telescope and refined sights.\"\nThe rifle's USP is its reliable bolt-action design, which is smooth, rugged, and easy to operate. A similar bolt-action design was later adopted in civilian rifles (like the 0.30-06 and 0.315 rifles), in India too. These are primarily used for home defence, and by farmers for crop protection.\nLee-Enfield rifles has a chequered history in India. In the 1962 Sino-Indian war that ended in India's defeat, it was primary weapon of the war's infantry soldiers. But on November 26, 2008, the Mumbai police relied on these old rifles as they faced off against Pakistani terrorists armed with sophisticated automatic weapons. Despite the technological mismatch, these rifles played a crucial role, aiding in the capture of a terrorist, Ajmal Kasab, during the initial assault at Marine Drive.\nStrong ergonomics\nArms and ammunition experts, both in India and abroad, consider the Lee-Enfield rifles \"to be one of the best-designed bolt-action rifles\". Their meticulous design contributes to their firepower, remarkable field presence, and impressive reliability, they say.\nDespite its more popular variant, SMLE No 1 Mk III, weighing around 4 kg, the design of the vintage rifle is extremely ergonomic. Suryaveer Singh, an engineer and a firearms enthusiast, tested out these rifles during his NCC days. He says, \"The rifle's weight distribution gives it a surprisingly light feel when it is in action. The reach (distance) between the trigger and the bolt is remarkable, allowing the shooter to eject and reload quickly. Despite minimal upgrades over 125 years, the rifle's minimalist design has helped it remain relevant.\"\nThe design also adds to the ease with which the rifle can be disassembled for maintenance and cleaning, he cites. \"A regular user simply needs to remove the bolt and the magazine (detachable ammunition storage device) to clean it. Rarely do gunsmiths have to tinker with the rifle and remove all its parts (mostly only in the case of a major malfunction),\" adds Suryaveer.\nEvergreen make\nThe rifle's smooth and reliable bolt-action mechanism makes it suitable for defence personnel, says another arms expert. The simple design involves a couple of moving parts, which ensures minimal risk of jams, malfunctions, and misfires. \"Hunting and sniper guns made in the 21st century continue to use this very design,\" he adds.\nIt is not only titanium and brass that make the Lee-Enfields effective, but also its beautifully crafted classic wooden stocks, which help in absorbing the strong recoil to some extent. The rifle is more manoeuvrable due to its shorter length as compared to muskets and other rifles of its time. A retired soldier who participated in the 1971 Indo-Pak war says, \"An easily manoeuvrable rifle like the Lee-Enfield can boost a shooter's confidence, resulting in more accurate shots.\"\nService continues\nIn India, the rifle was primarily used by the Indian Army until the early 1960s when it was handed over to the state forces. Self-loading rifles (SLR) replaced them in the military in the mid-60s. But the Lee-Enfield continued to be a part of the country's civil defence for the next six decades, until the early 2020s when state forces of Uttar Pradesh and recently Delhi started phasing them out.\nStill, it is widely used in small towns. While prohibited for civilians the civilian militia aka Village Defence Guards in the twin border towns of Rajouri and Poonch in Jammu & Kashmir are legally allowed to use Lee-Enfields (apart from SLRs). This is in a bid to confront cross-border terrorism.\nIn areas where it has been replaced by the INSAS rifle, it remains in service as a reserve (secondary) weapon. The RFI even proposed converting some of these rifles into riot-control weapons (used to disperse rioters rather than cause serious injury or death).\nThe Rifle Factory Ishapore (RFI) in West Bengal once produced around 2.5 lakh variants of the Lee-Enfield and called it the 'Ishapore 2a1 rifle'. It used 7.62 mm x 51 mm rounds (a standard bullet calibre used by forces in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation). Thousands of these remain in service today.\nThe fact that no other breech-loading rifle has been in service for so long speaks volumes about its simple, yet brilliant design.\nCollector's item\nDespite being in service and being a common sight in small towns in India, the Lee-Enfield rifles are slowly becoming a collector's item. These rifles produced by the RFI can fetch up to $1,200 (Rs 99,298 approximately) apiece in international markets. The approximate cost of the rifle is less than Rs 30,000.\nAnother classic\nMuch like the Lee-Enfield is to soldiers, civilians worldwide find their loyal guardians in the 12-bore shotguns. It is popular among farmers across India for crop protection. The versatility of the 12-bore is such that it is also preferred by elite soldiers in special units such as the USA's Navy SEALs and the UK's Special Air Service.\nAn Indian Army veteran DH spoke to said, \"It is popular because of its simple design and easy handling.\"\nOver centuries, artisans have transformed the civilian variants of these shotguns into aesthetic marvels, embellishing them with precious metals and gems, and meticulous carvings. A pair of ornate Westley Richards shotguns can cost up to $2,25,000 (approximately Rs 1.86 crore).\nBeyond its role as Olympic-grade sporting equipment, the shotgun has become a sought-after collectors' item.",

    "text": "The Food and Drug Administration approved a drug produced by AbbVie for the treatment of late stage Parkinsons disease the company announced Thursday. The regulator approved Vyalev , also known as Produodopa, a 24-hour infusion injected below the skin that treats motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinsons. \"For too long, the Parkinson's community has had limited treatment options for advanced disease,\" Dr. Robert A. Hauser, professor of neurology at the University of South Florida said in a press release. \"Due to the progressive nature of the disease, oral medications are eventually no longer as effective at motor symptom control and surgical treatment may be required.\" The company said that its phase 3 trials showed that superior improvement in motor fluctuations compared to an oral drug. AbbVie also said that the drug provided more \"on\" time where symptoms were relieved with less \"off\" time when symptoms return. The company said that adverse reactions among the approximately 70 people who received the drug in the 130-person trail were mild or moderate and included infusion site events, hallucinations, and dyskinesia. What is Parkinson's disease? Parkinson's disease is a progressive movement disorder that occurs when brain cells that make dopamine stop working or die, according to the Michael J. Fox Foundation. The Mayo Clinic says that symptoms of the disease include: - Tremors - Slowed movement - Rigid muscles - Poor posture and balance Late-stage symptoms include slurred speech and an inability to create facial expressions, according to the clinic. Approximately 1 million people in the United States and 6 million people suffer from the disease, according to the Fox Foundation. A 2022 study found that nearly 90,000 older Americans are afflicted with the disease each year.",
