    "title": "BREAKING: Police Respond To \"Assault In Progress\" Involving Miami Dolphins WR Tyreek Hill, 911 Call Released - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill was involved in a disturbing domestic dispute with his wife, daughter and mother-in-law at their Sunny Isles Beach condo on Wednesday afternoon. According to Local 10 News, police responded to a 911 call just before 2:00 p.m. EST after being told of an “assault in progress”. Officers spoke with Tyreek, his wife, Keeta Hill, and her mother, Alesia Vaccaro. Alesia told officers that Tyreek Hill was “very aggressive and impulsive”, and expressed concern over Keeta’s safety. According to the police report, officers were called after Hill threw a laptop to the ground and perilously took his young daughter toward the balcony of the high-rise building: “Authorities said Vacarro called police after claiming that she witnessed Tyreek Hill throw a laptop on the floor, then grab his daughter and begin walking toward the balcony of their residence, following an argument with his wife. Keeta Hill told police that she and Tyreek Hill had been arguing more frequently and stated that whenever she gives her opinion on anything they discuss, “he becomes angry and throws objects around,” the report stated.” Thankfully, the baby was not harmed and is in “good health,” the police report stated. You can hear parts of the 911 call below, but a warning that it may be disturbing for some viewers: According to Local 10 News, there are no pending charges. Even though both sides maintained that it didn’t turn violent, the police report says they noticed “a light redness mark (bruise) on” Alesia’s upper left chest. When officers questioned her about it, Alesia claimed, “it probably had happened without malice when he grabbed the baby from her.” Keela also told officers that she’s filing a divorce from Tyreek Hill. The 31-year-old wide receiver left the condo with police but was not arrested, Local 10 News added. There has been no public comment from Hill or the Dolphins. In December 2014, Hill was arrested after assaulting his pregnant girlfriend, Crystal Espinal. Though he avoided prison time, Hill was given three years probation and kicked off the Oklahoma State football team, prompting him to join the West Alabama program. During the 2019 offseason, a leaked recording emerged of Hill telling his fiancée, “You should be afraid of me too, b**ch,” when she told Hill that their young son (who had suffered a broken arm) was scared of him. Last September, Miami police detained Hill while en route to the team’s season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Hill was taken out of the car and handcuffed despite showing no aggression toward the officers. Two traffic citations were later dismissed, and one of the officers involved was placed on administrative leave. The post originally published on .",

She was one of 36 referees announced by the league Thursday as its referee selections for Round 1 of the playoffs starting this weekend.\n“It’s surreal,” Moyer-Gleich said. “It really is.”\nShe joins Violet Palmer as the only women picked by the NBA for a playoff assignment. Palmer worked nine playoff games between 2006 and 2012.\nMoyer-Gleich, a former Division II player at Millersville University in her native Pennsylvania, was promoted to the full-time NBA officiating ranks in November 2018. She’s worked more than 200 regular season games in her six seasons and is one of three first-time playoff selections by the league this year — Marat Kogut and J.T. Orr are the others.\n“I worked four games as an alternate last year, so obviously, my goal was I wanted to be an alternate again because that’s just sustaining the growth that I’ve had in my career,” Moyer-Gleich said. “And then to see my name on list of working floor officials … I mean, my mom was with me, she came with me on my last two games for a little trip, and to open that email and have her there with me and share that news, it was really quite amazing.”",

    "text": "Green Pharma City In TG Very Good Initiative It will fuel growth of pharma sector in Telangana besides benefiting the State’s economy, says Aurobindo’s Madan Mohan Reddy Green Pharma City In TG Very Good Initiative The Telangana government has taken a right decision to go for pollution-free pharma city. Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturing units related to injectables and formulations will only come up there - M Madan Mohan Reddy, Whole-Time Director, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, tells Bizz Buzz Hyderabad: The Green Pharma City initiative taken up by the Telangana government is a very good initiative that will not only fuel the growth of the pharmaceutical sector in the State, but will also benefit the Telangana’s economy, said M Madan Mohan Reddy, Whole-Time Director, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, a city-based pharmaceutical major. “The Telangana government has taken the right decision to go for a pollution-free pharma city. Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturing units related to injectables and formulations will only come up there. The government said it will not allow any units related to APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) in the project,” Madan Mohan Reddy told Bizz Buzz. Madan Mohan Reddy along with representatives from other pharma majors Dr Reddy’s, Hetero Drugs, Laurus Labs, and MSN Pharmaceuticals, took part in a review meeting convened by Telangana IT and Industries Minister Duddilla Sridhar Babu on the progress of the Green Pharma City in Hyderabad on Wednesday. “The meeting went off very well. The government is taking up the project in a professional way. The officials are very positive in their approach. Green Pharma City will benefit the State in a big way,” he said. Asked about the investment that Aurobindo will make in the Green Pharma City, he said the company would finalise its strategy soon. “Location is good and close to the city. It offers a good opportunity for any pharma company to invest. But the project is still in early stages. The government will have to finalise the layout and we will have to sign MoUs,” Reddy explained. The proposed Green Pharma City will be a part of Future City to be developed by the State government in phases, according to Minister D Sridhar Babu. During the meeting with representatives from five pharma companies, he said that infrastructure would be developed to ensure uninterrupted water and electricity supply. The government would build a 300-feet highway from Kongara Kalan to the proposed Regional Ring Road. The tendering process for the road is likely to be concluded by June next year. To support pharma industries in the park, the State government will develop logistics parks, packaging zones, and dormitories for workers at a later date. Other infrastructure related proposals include a centralised steam (hot water vapour) supply through pipelines, which would eliminate the need for individual boilers for each industry, and a dedicated water supply system, which will be directly managed by Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC). Further, the government will soon announce industrial electricity policy. According to the official statement, the new pharma city will be ready for setting up units within a year and pharma majors will put up their manufacturing facilities in 50-acre plots initially. According to industry experts, an investment of Rs1,000 crore is required to put a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on a 50-acre site. It is said that the Telangana government will hold more consultations with the pharma industry representatives to attract more investments into the Hyderabad Green Pharma City.",

    "text": "(TMX) -- Cher has filed for conservatorship of her son Elijah Blue Allman’s estate due to alleged substance abuse problems.\nThe 77-year-old music icon is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, according to documents filed in Los Angeles. Cher claims Allman, 47, is “currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.”\nThe filing says a conservator is “urgently needed” because he is due to receive a payout from his trust before the end of the year.\n“Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues, [Cher] is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk,” the filing states.\nAllman is Cher’s youngest child, and his father is the late musician Gregg Allman.\nAccording to the filing, Allman’s estranged wife, Marieangela King, is unfit to be conservator as “their tumultuous relationship has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises.”\nEarlier this year, Cher was accused of kidnapping after reports surfaced that she allegedly hired four men to retrieve Allman from a New York hotel in November 2022 as part of an intervention. King, 36, alleged Cher hired the men to stop him from reconciling with her and save their marriage.\nCher denied the reports.\nAccording to the conservatorship filing, Cher “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.”\nCopyright 2023 TMX.

    "title": "Wreath Laid in Budapest in Honor of Heroic Paratrooper Hannah Szenes",
    "text": "A wreath was laid in Budapest, Hungary’s capital, on Friday to honor Hannah Szenes, the courageous paratrooper who embarked on a perilous mission during World War II and tragically did not return. The ceremony was a poignant reminder of Szenes’ bravery. Szenes, celebrated for her heroism and sacrifice, undertook a mission to assist Allied forces in Europe and aid Jewish communities suffering under Nazi oppression. Although captured, tortured, and executed at just 23 years old, her legacy lives on, particularly in Israel, where she is revered as a national hero. Rakefet Senesh-Shkiler, her great-grandniece, addressed a group of journalists, sharing the story of Szenes’ courage and sacrifice. She highlighted the importance of remembering Szenes’ plight and spoke of the October 7 attack on southern Israel, which deeply impacted her and the nation. Senesh-Shkiler drew parallels between the resilience and strength of her great-aunt and the spirit needed to overcome the challenges faced today.",
