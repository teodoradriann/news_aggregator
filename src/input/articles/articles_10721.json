    "text": "The executive director of Columbus, Georgia’s Pride organization was arrested Wednesday after police discovered a trove of drugs, paraphernalia and a .38 revolver at his home. Police say Jeremy Hobbs, age 49, was the subject of a months-long investigation that resulted in a search warrant for his home where investigators found and seized 5.4 grams of crack cocaine, 20.7 grams of methamphetamine, 23.8 grams of liquid GHB and an INA .38 revolver.

He’s been charged with possession of those substances and “drug-related objects,” as well as possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.

Hobbs’ arrest has rocked the tiny Pride organization he headed. Colgay Pride [released a statement](https://www.facebook.com/COLGAYPRIDE/) Wednesday night in response to Hobbs’ arrest. “The board of the Debra Smith Wellness Center, Inc., doing business as Colgay Pride, expresses our utmost concern and regret regarding the arrest and charges facing our Executive Director, Jeremy Hobbs,” said Harry Underwood, vice president of communications for the 501(c)(3) org. “The charges which have been filed against him are serious,” Underwood’s statement continued. “The board does not condone the alleged actions and we will cooperate with law enforcement in the coming investigations regarding our operations and finances.” Hobbs pleaded not guilty to the charges at an arraignment hearing on Wednesday and remains in custody pending a $25,000 bond. Police obtained a search warrant for Hobb’s’ residence in Columbus, the same listed address for Colgay Pride, the non-profit that Hobbs founded and runs. Colgay Pride celebrated its 11th Annual Columbus Georgia Pride Festival on June 1 with a tiny parade that wrapped around a square block on Broadway in Uptown Columbus. Earlier this month, Hobbs announced a Pride partnership for the 2025 festival, joining with Phenix City, Alabama across the Chattahoochee River. “Together, we’re creating the first-ever Bi-City and Bi-State Pride Festival — a momentous occasion that transcends borders and celebrates love, acceptance, and unity,” Hobbs posted to Facebook. In the wake of Hobbs’ arrest, Colgay Pride isn’t waiting for a determination of their leader’s guilt or innocence. “Our organization will meet to discuss our next steps, including a transition in leadership and strategy in the interim period,” Underwood wrote on the org’s Facebook page. “Our events and operations are on hold until further notice.” “With humility,” Underwood added, “we ask for the understanding and solidarity of the local community in this period. We apologize to our allies, colleagues and partners for the distress caused by these developments.” Don't forget to share:",

    "title": "India Uses Weak Passwords That Can Be Cracked in Under a Second | STUDY",
    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nA new survey by NordPass reveals that India is using some of the weakest passwords globally, which can be cracked in under a second. The survey, part of the NordPass Top 200 Most Common Passwords report, found that “123456” remains the most used password worldwide, including in India, with nearly 77,000 Indian users opting for it. Another commonly used password, “123456789,” ranked second globally and fourth in India.\nThe survey, in collaboration with NordStellar, shows a troubling global trend of relying on simple, easy-to-remember patterns such as “qwerty,” “1q2w3e4er5t,” and “123456789.” These patterns are just as prevalent in India, where convenience often trumps security. With an average internet user managing 168 personal and 87 work-related passwords, many opt for easily remembered choices, though this significantly weakens their defenses against hackers.\nThe study highlights that a majority of the most common passwords can be cracked in under a second. “Qwerty123” and “password” are common offenders, both still widely used in India, as well as globally. In India, there are slight cultural variations, such as “Indya123,” showing the local influence on weak password choices.\nThe survey also found that 78% of the most commonly used passwords worldwide can be cracked in less than a second, a troubling rise from 70% the previous year. The report further points out that this issue extends to businesses, where employees frequently reuse passwords between personal and work accounts, often relying on default terms like “admin” or “newmember.”\nThis trend stresses the urgent need for stronger, more secure passwords and enhanced cyber hygiene practices for individuals and businesses alike to protect against the growing threat of cyberattacks and data breaches.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist Mary Walrath-Holdridge USA TODAY A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her.\nThe civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "As Australia's peak body for scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians, we warmly welcome the Prime Minister's announcement that the Albanese Government intends to create a Future Made in Australia Act. This will spur investment in clean energy technologies and secure economic opportunity and growth for Australia. The Prime Minister's announcement acknowledges the global competition for the economic benefits offered by clean energy tech development - and the urgent need for Australia to position itself as a solid leader in this race. \"This announcement from the Government recognises the urgency - and strategic imperative - to secure economic benefit from the opportunities arising from the energy transformation. This is critical for Australia to transform our expertise into products, build our sovereign capability, and secure our future prosperity,\" said STA's President Professor Sharath Sriram. \"To build the economic complexity our nation needs to remain prosperous, while transitioning to a net zero future, we will have to make significant, strategic investments in R&D and innovation. And we will have to make STEM careers more attractive to secure the future workforce and leverage their talents.\" To be the innovative nation we need to be, Australia must invest more in R&D - spending has been falling for the past decade and we are now well below international competitors. STA renews its call for a pathway to lift national R&D investment to 3% of GDP. All sectors of the economy must do their part - and Government can lead by investing in research and creating the policy framework to pull all the threads together effectively. We look forward to working with Government and the Minister for Science and Industry, Ed Husic, as they develop - and implement - a plan for Australia's future - made here for Australia and the world.

    "text": "Base aérea da Otan na Alemanha eleva alerta de segurança para \"ameaça potencial\"\nA base aérea da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (Otan) na cidade alemã de Geilenkirchen elevou seu alerta de segurança \"com base em informações de inteligência indicando uma potencial ameaça\", afirmou o órgão nesta quinta-feira.\n\"Todos os funcionários essenciais que não estão em missão foram mandados para casa por precaução\", informou a base em comunicado publicado na plataforma de redes sociais X, sem mais detalhes.\n\"A segurança de nosso pessoal é nossa principal prioridade. As operações continuam conforme planejado.\"\nUm porta-voz da base em Geilenkirchen afirmou que o nível de ameaça foi elevado para Charlie, o segundo mais alto entre os quatro existentes, definido como \"um incidente ocorrido ou informações de inteligência recebidas, indicando que alguma forma de ação terrorista contra organizações ou pessoal da Otan é altamente provável\".\nFoi a segunda vez que a base, que abriga a frota de aeronaves de vigilância AWACS, elevou seu nível de segurança, após a ocorrência de um incidente na semana passada, quando uma base militar em Colônia foi temporariamente fechada, com autoridades investigando uma possível sabotagem no fornecimento de água.\nNo mesmo dia, a base em Geilenkirchen reportou uma tentativa de invasão, causando uma varredura completa de suas instalações.\nSobre a suposta sabotagem em Colônia, o setor militar alemão informou posteriormente que segundo os resultados, a água não havia sido contaminada.\nNo passado, a Otan alertou sobre possíveis atividades hostis da Rússia, inclusive com atos de sabotagem e ataques cibernéticos. Os russos também acusam frequentemente a organização de ameaçar a sua segurança.",
