    "text": "“I want to clearly say to all colleagues and analysts, as well as to our friends and like-minded people: There is no way that success can be presented as failure. Despite many efforts in this direction. Air Schengen is not “nothing”, the co-chairman of PP Kiril Petkov.\n“I understand that our political and geopolitical opponents are not particularly happy about the\nnews of Bulgaria’s acceptance into the Schengen Agreement.\nHowever, there are times when political and party interests must give way to national interests. And today is just such a day.\n– Bulgaria has been waiting for this moment for 12 years.\n– Air Schengen is “nothing” – ask the tens of thousands of Bulgarians who fill airports and airline planes, work in Europe, go home to their relatives for the holidays.\n– We will receive significant financial resources to strengthen the borders.\n– This decision will be an incentive for the Bulgarian border\npolice to work even better, it will be a blow to human traffickers.\n– There will be an increased presence of “Frontex” forces in guarding the border – this is solidarity and exchange of experience, and is an additional security guarantee.\n– We’re in the game. Bulgaria politically becomes a Schengen member, participates in all formats and negotiations, has the right of veto.\n– Our acceptance into Schengen for the air and sea borders was a matter of regained trust, a matter of security and a matter of European integration. Europe gives us what we deserve for all three.\nRead more: Joo Ho-young suggests veto power as the sole means to thwart the Grain Management Act and labels the Democratic Party's behavior as shameful.\n– We are still obliged to register and accept migrants – this is according to the Dublin Agreement – it is nothing new.\n–\nRussia, whose policy is to encourage migrants from the Middle East to Europe by any means, is now deploying all its media and institutional resources to portray Bulgaria’s success as a failure. For example, look at what is happening with Finland right now – they are closing their borders because Russia is bussing large groups of refugees. A few months ago, the same thing happened on the Polish-Belarusian border.\nI congratulate Nikolay Denkov and the entire government for the huge step forward,” Petkov also wrote.\n2023-12-30 19:43:00\n#Kiril #Petkov #Air #Schengen #success #presented #failure",

    "title": "Patriots Rumors: QB Plan 'News' To 'High-Ranking' Executives",
    "text": "The Patriots reportedly are “zeroing in” on a three-step plan to completely reshape their quarterback room, but according to a conflicting report, they haven’t made that plan known to “high-ranking personnel evaluators” in their own front office. It looks like we’ve got a good old-fashioned source-off! Andrew Callahan and Doug Kyed of the Boston Herald published a report Thursday that threw some cold water on a previously reported story by Mark Daniels, Karen Guregian and Chris Mason of MassLive. The MassLive story essentially laid out a plan the Patriots reportedly intend on executing this offseason. It would see them select a quarterback with the No. 3 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, sign a veteran free agent and ship Mac Jones off to pastures anew. The Boston Herald story, which was posted a number of hours later , claims “such a decision has not been communicated throughout the Patriots’ front office.” Story continues below advertisement More Patriots Patriots director of scouting Eliot Wolf recently led pre-combine meetings where scouts deliberated drafting a quarterback at No. 3, according to Kyed and Callahan’s sources. That means New England has not yet made a decision. There’s an easy explanation for all of this, and that’s the fact that some sources might not be as well informed as others. If the Patriots did have a plan in place, not everyone in the building would be privy to it. New England also has two months to change things up, so at this point, it’s all conjecture anyway. [Leave a comment.](javascript:void(0)) It’s interesting to think about how the inner workings of New England’s front office have changed in recent months, however. Bill Belichick rarely let his plans leak, though he never had this big of a decision looming at the start of an offseason. Jerod Mayo has been telling us it’s a new era in New England , and that’s becoming more clear with each day report.

There is a slim 10% chance of rain for SE OK & NE TX today while the rest of the region stays completely dry. High temperatures get up to the upper 80′s and lower 90′s.\nThe weekend provides plenty of sunshine ahead for both days with not a drop of rain in sight. High temperatures ramp up each day with high’s on Saturday reaching the lower 90′s and high’s on Sunday reaching the mid 80′s.\nSunshine rolls on all of next work week as we look to continue our dry stretch of weather. The next chance of rain might come the following weekend, but we’ll see. High temperatures drop a lot next week. High’s slightly cool into the mid to upper 80′s for Monday before falling into the mid to upper 70′s for Tuesday. High’s then look to stay around that mark for the rest of the work week with low temperatures dipping into the 40′s by Wednesday morning.\nHave a fantastic Friday & a great sunny weekend!\n- Meteorologist Evan Thomason\nCopyright 2024 KSLA.

Have a tip for Nosh? Submit it here.\nAli Baba\nAli Baba, a Middle Eastern café coveted for its breakfast burritos, wordlessly closed its Berkeley location, a reader reports. For those willing to make the trek, its original Davis location is still open. Ali Baba was located at 1805 Euclid Ave.\nFuji Summer\nA reader let us know that Fuji Summer, a modern Japanese restaurant on Oakland’s Piedmont Ave., has apparently shuttered. The restaurant wasn’t reachable by phone, and the “closed” sign has reportedly been up for several weeks. Fuji Summer was located at 3858 Piedmont Ave.\nHapuku Fish Shop\nAfter 20 years of pouring heart and sole into Rockridge’s Market Hall, Hapuku Fish Shop closed for good on Jan. 26. While loyal patrons are sad to see Hapuku (and their fish and chips) go, they’ll still find fresh seafood at Market Hall: Billingsgate Seafood is slated to open in Hapuku’s place in the coming days. We’ll keep you posted. Hapuku was located at 5655 College Ave. in Oakland.\nTuk Tuk Thai Café\nThanks to several tipsters, we learned that the family-run establishment Tuk Tuk Thai Café has closed for good after serving the Berkeley community for 24 years. The closure was confirmed on Tuk Tuk’s website. Tuk Tuk Thai Café was located at 2468 Shattuck Ave. in Berkeley.",
