    "title": "Una ONG denuncia la muerte de 14 personas en una zódiac al sur de Canarias - Diario Córdoba",
    "text": "Al menos catorce personas han muerto ahogadas en una zódiac cuyos ocupantes llevan pidiendo auxilio desde las 14.00 horas de este jueves desde un punto del Atlántico situado a unos 55 kilómetros de Cabo Bojador, en la costa marroquí del Sáhara Occidental, al sur de [Canarias](https://www.diariocordoba.com/tags/islas-canarias/), porque su barca se desinfla y se hunden. Es la denuncia que realiza la activista Helena Maleno, fundadora de Caminando Fronteras, ONG que lleva toda la tarde de este jueves en contacto con los náufragos y que ha transmitido su posición a las autoridades españolas y marroquíes para que movilicen medios de rescate. Por la localización del incidente, ha asumido la emergencia Rabat. Maleno ha facilitado a EFE una foto enviada por los supervivientes que todavía siguen a flote, una imagen nocturna y borrosa en la que se ve a entre seis y siete personas sentadas a horcajadas sobre un flotador de una neumática, doblado y medio deshinchado. Y también un audio que le ha remitido una de las ocupantes de la patera. En él se escucha a una mujer decir en francés: \"Estamos aquí, Helena. Soy una mujer embarazada de nueve meses, estoy en el flotador (de la zódiac). Todos los chicos del medio (de la embarcación) han desaparecido, la gente está desapareciendo, hasta ahora no hemos visto a la Marina\". \"Toda la gente está desapareciendo. ¡Por favor ayúdennos, ayúdennos! ¡Estamos aquí, ayúdennos! Estamos sentados así en el flotador (se refiere a la imagen que adjunta con el audio). Es muy peligroso, el agua está entrando\", se lamenta la mujer Helena Maleno ha explicado a EFE que, según la información que han recabado sobre esa neumática, se trata de un grupo de 58 personas que salieron el miércoles desde la costa del Sahara hacia Canarias y que ahora se encuentran al suroeste de Cabo Bojador. Entre ellos, añade, hay siete mujeres (incluyendo a la embarazada) y dos niños. La portavoz de Caminando Fronteras denuncia que, hasta el momento, Marruecos no ha hecho llegar ayuda a los ocupantes de esa neumática, ni tampoco Salvamento Marítimo español ha intervenido. Por eso, expresa su temor a que ocurra lo mismo que el 21 de junio, cuando varias personas murieron al hundirse una zódiac al sur de Gran Canaria después de pasar toda la noche esperando a que llegara una patrullera de Marruecos, porque la emergencia la había asumido el Centro de Coordinación de Salvamento de Rabat. Y ello, a pesar de que un barco de rescate español había estado a solo una hora de distancia de navegación de ellos, socorriendo a otra patera, cuando ya se conocían sus coordenadas. Ese suceso dio lugar una denuncia de la Fiscalía de Canarias por presunto delito de omisión del deber de socorro contra los responsables del operativo en España, denuncia que desde este verano instruye un Juzgado de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, que ha declarado secretas las actuaciones.",

    "title": "Russia Ramps Up Sabotage Operations in Europe",
    "text": "Welcome back to Foreign Policy’s SitRep. Jack is taking a well-deserved vacation this week, so our colleague Amy Mackinnon is filling in.\nBy the way, there’s a major NATO summit coming up in Washington next month with dozens of world leaders flying in to attend. Robbie and Jack will be on the ground reporting on all the major developments and scoops throughout the summit with special daily editions of Situation Report. Stay tuned to your inboxes, and spread the word if you know anyone interested in signing up for SitRep and following along.\nAlright, here’s what’s on tap for the day: Russia ramps up sabotage attacks on NATO soil, a U.N. commission accuses both Israel and Hamas of war crimes, and Belarus and Russia conduct joint nuclear drills.\nThe normally covert world of espionage has exploded across the headlines in Europe in recent months as Russian operatives reportedly step up sabotage operations and so-called gray zone, or “ hybrid ,” attacks in the West.\nThe campaign that officials link to Russia or Russian-backed operatives has included an arson attack on a Ukrainian-linked business in London, a wave of cyberattacks to disrupt European railway networks in countries on NATO’s eastern flank, the jamming of GPS signals across the Baltic states, a botched attempt to set Czech buses on fire, and failed plots to sabotage U.S. military bases in Germany. Other incidents—such as a fire in May at a factory in Germany owned by a company that helps produce air defense systems and a mysterious explosion at a British munitions factory in April—haven’t been proved to be acts of sabotage and may have been simple accidents, but officials remain suspicious.\n“Virtually every ally was seized with this intensification of Russia’s hybrid attacks,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague last month. “We know what they’re up to, and we will respond both individually and collectively as necessary.”\nAll flash, no bang? From a 30,000-foot view, these attacks are sporadic and extremely limited in their effectiveness. They haven’t made a dent in Western countries’ or their defense industries’ abilities to supply Ukraine, officials said. (Those supply lines are already strained , even without any Russian sabotage.)\nBut they reflect how the Kremlin has become increasingly brazen in its efforts to stem the flow of Western aid to Ukraine, part of a worrying trend that could increase the probability of a military confrontation between Russia and NATO.\nRussia has warned that several NATO countries’ recent decisions to allow Ukraine to use their weapons to strike Russian territory could escalate the conflict, and President Vladimir Putin suggested that Moscow could supply long-range weapons to enemies of the West in response (though he didn’t offer specifics). NATO allies say the decision is necessary for Ukraine to be able to defend itself, particularly in vulnerable Ukrainian cities near the Russian border.\nCheap wins. One of the reasons that Russia engages in such sophisticated gradations of hybrid warfare is because it’s a relatively low-risk, low-cost, and potentially high-reward strategy, multiple European officials who spoke to SitRep said. These officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security issues. The campaign in Europe is being run primarily by the Russian military intelligence branch, known as the GRU, officials said. Moscow has arranged this campaign through proxies—Russian diaspora groups and criminal gangs it has links to—to make it harder to trace specific acts directly back to the Russian government.\nEven if the attacks fail, top European officials say they are clearly aimed at intimidating Western countries and imposing higher costs on them for continuing to support Ukraine in its over two-year-long war against the Russian invasion.\nAnother advantage for Russia: It’s easy (at least in theory) to deter conventional military attacks but much harder for Western countries to deter hybrid attacks. Such operations also fall below the threshold of an overt military attack that could trigger NATO’s Article 5 collective-defense clause. (Despite Moscow’s gloves-off onslaught in Ukraine, it still clearly wants to avoid a military showdown with NATO.)\nNo quick and easy solution. The surge in new sabotage and espionage cases has alarmed Western national security officials, who concede there’s no silver-bullet strategy to halt Russian hybrid attacks.\nThe best counter-strategy is one that is costly and diffuse, spread across all aspects of society. Western countries’ current counter-strategy amounts to a combination of heightened vigilance, beefing up national resilience by hardening critical and cyber infrastructure, increasing public awareness of these threats, and doubling down on the types of police and counterintelligence work they’re already doing. On that last front, Western governments have clearly been busy, with headlines of suspected Russian spies being arrested across Europe cropping up almost weekly .\nMaryland Democratic Rep. Kweisi Mfume has been appointed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\nVarun Sivaram has joined the Council on Foreign Relations as a senior fellow for energy and climate.\nThe Center for a New American Security has named Bob Sorensen, of technology firm Hyperion Research, as an adjunct senior fellow in its Technology and National Security program.\nAbraham Denmark, senior advisor for the AUKUS initiative at the Pentagon, is leaving his post.\nWhat should be high on your radar, if it isn’t already.\nNothing to see here. Russia and Belarus began the second phase of joint tactical nuclear weapons drills on Tuesday, which officials in Moscow have stated are intended to be a shot across the bow at Western governments. Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said on Tuesday that the exercises were a response to “Western support of the Kyiv regime.”\nLast year, Russia transferred a number of its tactical nuclear weapons to neighboring Belarus, which borders several NATO members, further cementing the country’s place in Moscow’s orbit in the wake of mass street protests in 2020 that rattled longtime President Aleksandr Lukashenko’s grip on power.\n“The deployment of nuclear weapons in our country anchors the presence of Russia in Belarus for many, many years ahead,” said Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in an interview with FP this week. “It is subjugating a piece of our sovereignty.”\nWar crimes investigation. A United Nations commission of inquiry has accused Israel and Palestinian armed groups of committing war crimes during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel and in the subsequent war in Gaza. The accusations, which came in a report released on Wednesday, are the result of the first in-depth U.N. investigation into the conflict.\nThe report itself does not carry any immediate legal consequences, but it found that Israel, which did not cooperate with the investigation, is likely responsible for a number of war crimes including using starvation as a method of warfare, willful killing, directing attacks on civilians, and committing sexual violence. Hamas and six other Palestinian armed groups also stand accused of committing war crimes on Oct. 7 including murder, rape, torture, and the taking of hostages.\nAlso this week, an investigation published by the start-up news outlet Zeteo found that Israeli soldiers have posted hundreds of photos on social media from Gaza, including images of Palestinian detainees stripped down to their underwear and Israeli troops posing with women’s lingerie and other personal items inside Palestinian homes. A spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) told the outlet that all of the images it uncovered were “inconsistent with the values of the IDF” and that a number of instances highlighted in the report had already been examined and “dealt with at the disciplinary and command level.”\nImproving America’s cyber health. The Biden administration is trying to call in the big guns to protect America’s hospitals from being crippled by cyberattacks. A new partnership with Google and Microsoft announced by the White House this week will see the two tech giants provide heavily subsidized cybersecurity support to rural hospitals across the United States.\nIt’s part of a broader fight to protect U.S. critical infrastructure systems from cybercriminals and malicious ransomware attacks; attacks on hospitals are seen as one of the highest-risk ways that cyberattacks could directly lead to the deaths of innocent civilians. Cyberattacks against the U.S. health care system went up by a staggering 128 percent between 2022 and 2023, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Those attacks have come “largely from Russia-based criminals,” Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger told reporters in a briefing on the new initiative.—Rishi Iyengar\nThursday, June 13: U.S. President Joe Biden arrives in Italy for a G-7 summit.\nNATO defense ministers begin a two-day meeting in Brussels.\n“I’m a woman, and I’m trying to coach 15 men who all have egos. So yeah, you’ve got to be a little hard on them. I run a tight ship.”\n—U.S. Rep. Linda T. Sánchez, on coaching her roster of Democratic members of Congress ahead of the annual Democrat-versus-Republican congressional baseball game .\nNaming rights. Our favorite headline of the week comes from Politico Europe : “Tony Blair meets Tonibler, Tonibler, Tonibler, Tonibler, and Tonibler.” Evidently, naming children after the former British prime minister who played a significant role in Kosovo’s liberation 25 years ago is common among many Kosovars.\nThe post Russia Ramps Up Sabotage Operations in Europe appeared first on Foreign Policy .",

    "title": "'Really special': Plattsburg students learning while making, selling t-shirts",
    "text": "PLATTSBURG, Mo. — I was in a Northland coffee shop when I spotted t-shirts for sale. It said \"KC\" and \"Kindness is Cool.\" I loved it. Then I saw the tag with a student’s picture and a story. That took me to Plattsburg High School where I met some of the students making these t-shirts and hundreds of others for their fellow students. VOICE FOR EVERYONE | [Share your voice with KSHB 41’s Lindsay Shively](mailto:lindsay.shively@kshb.com) Eva Belcher, a senior walked me through part of the t-shirt process like using the heat press. \"And then when it beeps, you just pull it up,\" Belcher said, while taking a t-shirt with a design newly pressed on to set aside to cool. Amanda Wilkinson, a special education teacher in the district, said the skills her students learn through making these shirts, like task completion and fine motor skills, are crucial. \"We work on them really hard throughout their high school years to get them ready to be independent and to hopefully have competitive employment after high school,\" Wilkinson said. We watched while students Sean, Zander, Kayden, and Shae helped make more shirts, fold them, and attach tags. They were helping make shirts for the marching band and student council. \"I like getting to make t-shirts because we get to make them for different people and different businesses,\" Belcher said. Businesses like HullHouse Coffee in Kansas City North, started by the Hull family who’s son Charlie graduated from Plattsburg High School and was one of Wilkinson’s students. The day we went to visit, one of the students, Kayden, was wearing a shirt the students had made. Wilkinson talked about how nice it is to see the shirts worn around their community, too. \"It’s really special and it happens really frequently,\" she said. Spreading school spirit and lessons beyond her classroom, through t-shirts. \"Everyone is special, and everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and I think that’s important for everyone to learn at an early age,\" Wilkinson said. Wilkinson said any money they make from the shirts goes back into the classroom for things like field trips to the grocery store and more. She also has middle school students who will help make them too. —",

    "title": "Northern lights illuminate Maine skies | Local News | foxbangor.com",
    "text": "STATEWIDE -- If you stepped outside Thursday night, you may have caught a glimpse of the Northern lights -- they were visible across our state and some of our viewers captured some eye-catching photos. According to Shawn Laatsch, director of the Versant Power Astronomy Center at the University of Maine, this is because the Sun is nearing the peak of the solar cycle -- which means more solar flares and the release of charged particles, leading to more frequent viewings in recent months. Those particles then collide with molecules in our own atmosphere -- creating those beautiful colors. \"The Sun has a variety of solar weather, and when it typically has what are called major solar flares or storms, it will release particles that will travel out on the solar wind. They impact the Earth's atmosphere and they're sort of deflected by our magnetic field,\" said Laatsch. Most smartphones can capture the phenomenon, even if you can't see it with the naked eye. So, if you're having trouble viewing the Northern lights when they come around, Laatsch says you might want to snap a picture of the night sky anyways. \"If you go out and they're saying you might see Aurora but you don't see it, try taking a picture of the Northern sky. Usually, a few-second exposure will help you find it,\" said Laatsch. Additionally, Laastch says dark skies are essential for viewing the Northern lights, which means heading out of the city and waiting until late at night for the best views. But you might get more chances as the Sun gets closer to peak activity next year. \"Aurora are always very difficult to predict, and one of the reasons is it depends on that particle stream from the Sun -- sometimes we have more, sometimes we have less. Right now, we're moving toward a solar maximum, which will happen sometime early next year and as a result we'll probably have more of these solar storms,\" said Laatsch. If you missed the phenomenon Thursday night, Laatsch says there's a chance you could see them again Friday night. You can visit spaceweather.com to track the latest solar flares and find viewing conditions in your area.",
