Artículos, libros, podcast, cursos, tutoriales... la lista prácticamente parece infinita y llevar un seguimiento puntual es una tarea titánica. Sin embargo, David Allen tiene claro [una regla](https://br.ign.com/tech/119478/news/o-grande-segredo-da-produtividade-e-um-metodo-muito-simples-a-regra-dos-dois-minutos) que es atractiva por su simpleza: la regla de los dos minutos. Planteada en [su libro](https://www.xataka.com.mx/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com.mx%2FGetting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity%2Fdp%2F0143126563%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3F__mk_es_MX%3D%25C3%2585M%25C3%2585%25C5%25BD%25C3%2595%25C3%2591%26crid%3D3AY5P4FI7BSSN%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JPu08UYkU4zwl38D65fqtJyxzju72keOlhc2a3bRb06mT69MAAaXfVAh4RLz1iRuRC7v_AQpTxBwU4ktHEIy-eJ1okXgQ0O7mFSX6uELTbIVCgxfQLiTbOEUHnxKOjB4CQJR1QK5O7X_Hpaj1xaPz1kvgWbMjyiAOmTAg53u4xmfLJ5iVi4fNYd1gWF3TTH84afafZzksmoMCp36V10jzCt2vg5PA5G0-sUnCIOkBBPE2g94Lax_cMUi15dxazzfaVYAgqZlvEpyEH6C0lGkahjD_Ufd1hcAYi8cYSfeMNE.TuNUg0hk-LRVurXr4-r2AEQDKbOcUtHhmDX888_v208%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3DGetting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity%26qid%3D1709239706%26sprefix%3Dgetting-things-done-stress-free-productivity%252Caps%252C125%26sr%3D8-1%26ufe%3Dapp_do%253Aamzn1.fos.4e545b5e-1d45-498b-8193-a253464ffa47&category=investigacion&ecomPostExpiration=everlasting&postId=203267) \"El arte de hacerlo realidad\", la regla forma parte de la metodología \"Getting Things Done\" de Allen, conocido actor y consultor en productividad. Esta regla consiste en que todo aquello que se pueda realizar en dos minutos o menos se debe hacer inmediatamente, y todo lo que supere esta duración debería estar anotado, en proceso de trámite o incluso clasificado. Con esta regla, el autor plantea que se puede ayudar a transformar la percepción de la productividad y la gestión de tiempo, ya que las pequeñas tareas, que se acumulan poco a poco, pueden convertirse en una fuente de estrés. Las tareas diminutas requieren simples acciones, pero el estrés que aportan al día a día es real. No hacerlas se traduce en peso mental que desvía la atención de las cosas importantes. Tras completar estas pequeñas tareas, Allen apunta a que se libera el espacio mental y la energía que se gastaría recordando y posponiendo las actividades. Hay un límite en este método Sin embargo, Allen también acepta que esta regla también tiene un problema: puede provocar que las personas se sobrecarguen con tareas pequeñas, perdiendo de vista objetivos más grandes. Para el autor, esta regla también conlleva una buena gestión de prioridades, ya que no se trata de todo hacerlo en dos minutos, sino identificar cuáles tareas ameritan dos minutos y cuáles más. Hacerlo requiere de cierta medida de concentración y enfoque. Lo importante es dedicar tiempo a hacer lo que importa y reconocer los asuntos que pueden resolverse en dos minutos o menos. Los beneficios potenciales son gigantescos. Llevar a cabo la regla adecuadamente conlleva una sensación de control y logro por completar los pendientes, dice Allen. De practicarse como lo recomendado, ciertamente ayudaría a las personas procrastinadoras que se saturan de pendientes por hacer.",

    "title": "Today's Top CD: 5.79% remains the best rate across all terms",
    "text": "Top CD rates held steady today, with the leading 5.79% APY on Climate First Bank's 8-month CD available for at least another day. The best CD rates across all terms remained unchanged for the third consecutive day.\nThe second best CD rate today is 5.75%, also offered by Inova Federal Credit Union on an 8 month term. With just a few days left in 2023, locking in the top CD rate could be the right move if the Federal Reserve decides to lower interest rates next year.\nkey takeaways\n- The top CD rate in our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs remains Climate First Bank's 8-month CD at 5.79% APY.\n- CD rates peaked at 6.50% in October, but today's top rates are still historically high.\n- Only two nationally available CDs pay at least 5.75% APY. Seven weeks ago, we counted 16 CDs that offered 5.75% APY or higher.\n- The top rate on a jumbo CD is 5.77%, offered on 6 month and 1 year CD terms.\n- The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates in the new year, so CD rates are likely to continue falling.\nBelow you'll find special rates available from our partners, followed by our full ranking of the best CDs available nationwide.\nThe number of CDs paying at least 5.75% reached a historic peak of 18 on November 3. But in the eight weeks since, that number has fallen sharply – now down to just two. Three other CDs pay 5.70% APY on terms of 7 to 14 months.\nThe highest rates will be available for a period of up to 18 months. But stellar rates can still be achieved on longer terms. The top-paying 2-year certificate offers 5.39% APY, while you can secure 5.23% for a 3-year term. And in 4-year and 5-year terms, you can lock in a long-term rate of up to 5.00% APY.\nAlthough the yields on these longer certificates are lower than those on certificates with shorter terms, it may be a smart move to secure one of today's record rates for as long as possible, as the current expectation is that interest rates will fall over the next few years. Will fall.\nfast facts\nWhen asked in December whether they were choosing certain investments more or less during recent market events, 28% of Investopedia readers said they were leaning into CDs – trailing only the leading choice of money market funds. One percentage point behind. Additionally, 11% of readers said they would open a CD if they had an extra $10,000 to invest, which ranked third behind individual stocks and ETFs.\nTo view the top 15-20 nationwide rates over any period, click on the desired period length in the top left column.\nFor anyone with a larger deposit size, the leading jumbo is 5.77% APY, available on My eBanc for a term of 6 months or 1 year.\n*Reflects the highest APY offered in each period. To see our list of top-paying CDs for banks, credit unions and jumbo certificates, click on the column headers above.\nNote that there are no jumbo CDs Always Pay higher returns than standard certificates. Sometimes you can do just as well—or even better—with a standard CD. This is currently the case for six of the eight conditions above, so it's smart to shop around for both certificate types before making a final decision.\nWhere are CD rates going next year?\nThe Federal Reserve earlier this month opted to keep rates steady at a 22-year high, its third consecutive meeting. The Fed has been aggressively combating decades-high inflation since March last year, raising the federal funds rate with a fast and furious hike in 2022 and then a more moderate increase in 2023.\nThis has historically created favorable conditions for those buying CDs, as well as anyone holding cash in a high-yield savings or money market account.\nInflation has moderated significantly in recent months, including a slight decline in November. And although Chair Powell said the rate-setting committee is not ruling out the possibility of future rate hikes, she also said in her press conference that Fed members have begun discussing lowering rates.\nThe Fed's dot plot shows that no member of the rate-setting committee predicts another rate hike in 2024. Instead, the average expectation is for three rate cuts in 2024, for a total decline of 0.75%.\nThis has important implications for CD buyers and other savers. Banks and credit unions base their deposit rates on the Fed funds rate. Even talk of a cut means that the wild rise in deposit rates that we saw is likely to end.\n“The Fed has virtually made it official that there will be no further rate hikes this cycle,” Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a statement.\n“This is a call to action for savers to lock in the current high CD rates and other rates in safe vehicles like Treasuries,” Frick said. “Those rates will likely remain low from here, and given that they are higher than the inflation rate, savers may still be able to earn real returns.”\nAs we always caution, trying to predict the Fed's future rate moves is an uncertain exercise. But for now, it looks like CD rates will continue to retreat from their recent peaks.\nNote that the “top rates” quoted here are the highest rates available nationally that Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is very different from the national average, which includes all banks offering CDs with that term, including many of the larger banks that pay much less in interest. Thus, the national average is always quite low, while the top rates you can get by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher.\nHow We Find the Top CD Rates Today\nEach business day, Investopedia tracks rate data from more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers across the country and determines a daily ranking of the top-paying certificates in each major period. To qualify for our list, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the minimum initial deposit amount of the CD must not exceed $25,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (for example, you don't live in a certain area or have a certain type of Do not work in a job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

    "title": "Weather Service: Severe Storm Threat Likely For Louisiana Sunday",
    "text": "Weather Service: Severe Storm Threat Likely For Louisiana Sunday\nA quick check of the National Weather Service radar out of Lake Charles, Louisiana, this morning revealed a widely scattered but fairly steady stream of mainly light showers. The rain is falling in the general area south of US 190, between Eunice and Crowley, and between Opelousas and Lafayette. Heavier showers are also indicated in southern Vermilion Parish and just offshore.\nForecasters believe the light shower activity should move out of the area later this morning and by Friday afternoon almost all of Louisiana should experience a mix of clouds and sun and temperatures in the upper 60s. That will begin to change during the day on Saturday as another storm system approaches. However, the biggest impact from that storm system won't likely be felt until Sunday afternoon from Lake Charles to Lafayette and then points eastward.\nThe Storm Prediction Center has placed a large portion of Louisiana at risk for severe storms on Sunday. The area of concern is the entire state with the exception of a small sliver of southern and southeastern Louisiana. Lake Charles is included in the \"risk\" zone but Lafayette is just on the outside.\nThat certainly doesn't mean Lafayette, Baton Rouge, or New Orleans won't see strong or even severe weather on Sunday. The forecast graphic merely suggests the greatest potential for more and more frequent strong storms will be generally north of I-10.\nThe National Weather Service Forecast Office in Lake Charles has noted that Sunday afternoon will be the most likely time for strong and severe storms. The threats that could be produced by those storms included large hail, damaging winds, and the possibility of tornadoes. It is possible severe weather watches and warnings could be posted for the area during the day on Sunday.\nOnce the storm system moves through the area Sunday night we can expect much colder temperatures across the region. Forecast lows early Monday morning are expected to be just above the freezing mark. Overnight low temperatures on Tuesday are expected to drop below freezing along and south of I-10. So now might be the time to start thinking of protecting your plants from frost on both Monday and Tuesday.\nTemperatures should stay below normal for much of the next work week.",

    "title": "RSV vaccines to carry neurological disorder risk warning after new research - Leeds Live",
    "text": "On Tuesday, January 7, the FDA announced it would now be requiring GSK and Pfizer’s RSV vaccines to hold warnings of a risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This is after post market analysis by the American regulator.\nThe study noted an increased risk of this neurological disorder in patients who had received the Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccine from each firm respectively. As a result, the agency issued a request for both companies to add this discovery to their warnings.\nOnly Pfizer’s Abrysvo vaccine is available on the NHS and the package leaflets in the UK already had this warning. In the leaflet, GBS is highlighted as a serious side effect.\nHowever, it notes that it’s “rare” as it may affect up to one in 1,000 people, particularly in the over 60 demographic. The condition is rare in the general population but is also more likely to occur after an infection.\nGBS is a rare, serious neurological condition that affects the nerves and requires urgent hospital treatment. It can have an impact on your senses, movement and even your heartbeat although symptoms usually arise in your arms and legs first.\nThis can include tingling, numbness or pins and needles in your hands and feet followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving your joints. Sufferers also face sharp, shooting nerve pain in their legs or back.\nIt can incite problems with their breathing, face and eyes. This can include issues with swallowing, speaking or double vision.\nSymptoms gradually get worse over the first month and can progress to the point where they are unable to move their legs, arms or face. Treatment usually includes hospital stays spanning weeks or months to receive immunotherapy through an IV or plasma exchange, pain management medication and may require the person to be on a ventilator if their breathing problems become bad enough.\nThe NHS notes that most people will be able to walk within six months and will recover fully within a year after their hospital stay. While the exact cause of GBS is currently a mystery, it’s believed to be an autoimmune disorder that is triggered when the body’s immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system.\nThe FDA’s research followed Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older from May 2023 until June 2024. It suggested there is an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) 42 days following vaccination but noted there was insufficient evidence to establish a “casual relationship”.\nThe agency ultimately determined: “The benefits of vaccination with Abrysvo and Arexvy continue to outweigh their risks.”\nA Pfizer spokesperson told Reach: “As with every medicine and vaccine, Pfizer has robust processes to meet its regulatory responsibilities to closely monitor, report and analyse all adverse events, and collect relevant information to assess any new potential safety risks that may be associated with the RSV (bivalent, recombinant) vaccine. As part of our pharmacovigilance efforts and compliance with regulatory requirements related to quality and safety, we also work closely with the MHRA in the UK, as they independently monitor the safety profile of our vaccine.”\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
