    "text": "- By [Imran Zafar](https://english.jagran.com/authors/imran-zafar) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 03:25 PM (IST) - Source:JND Sunehri Masjid Demolition: The New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) sought public opinion on its proposed demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid, which is located near the Parliament. In a notice issued on Sunday, the civic body officials invited citizen’s objections and suggestions on the matter by January 1. The NDMC stated that the mosque is leading to traffic congestion and removing the same will help in traffic management in the area. The NDMC received hundreds of suggestions from Sunday on the email ID, chief.architect@ndmc.gov.in, requesting the civic body to not demolish the historical structure. Most of the emails received were from Muslim organisations and minority welfare bodies, news agency PTI reported. NDMC chairman Amit Yadav answered a question about the possible demolition of the mosque at the budget press conference. \"We have sought public feedback on the Sunehri Masjid. We had got a request from the Delhi Traffic Police on traffic snarls being reported around the area. We had started the process and sought comments from various stakeholders. We had also approached the religious committee but the Delhi Waqf Board went to the court over the matter,\" he said. Amit Yadav said that NDMC has requested public opinion on the issue and following the proper procedure. The public opinion will be reviewed and the heritage committee will also consider it. Historical Importance Of Sunehri Masjid Sunehri Masjid is located in a green circle where six roads meet in Lutyens’ Delhi. Next to it are the IAF headquarters and Udyog Bhawan. The mosque dates back to pre-independent India and is listed as a Grade-III Heritage building as per a 2009 notification of the government. It is more than 150 years old and was built during the Mughal era by Roshan-ud-Daula, a nobleman. The mosque has a historical and cultural significance, as it was one of the places of worship that the British agreed to spare when they acquired the land around Delhi in 1911. The Sunheri Masjid also hosted freedom fighters like Maulana Hasrat Mohani, who coined the slogan \"Inquilab Zindabad'' and moved the resolution for complete independence from the British in 1921. Meanwhile, the Delhi Waqf Board claims ownership of the land on which the mosque is built and challenged the NDMC’s notification in the Delhi High Court. The imam of the mosque, Abdul Aziz, has denied that the mosque causes traffic congestion and has submitted evidence to the NDMC.

The NDMC’s notification about the demolition also raised criticism from the political sphere where several Muslim MPs raised concerns about the decision. Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi also wrote to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC)’s chief architect opposing the proposal to remove Sunehri Bagh's Sunehri Masjid from the list of heritage buildings by the national capital's civic body. \"It is not only unfortunate but astounding that the Council thinks that a mosque that has been functioning for the past 200 years is an \"obstruction.\" It is also unfortunate that the Council has ignored its duty to conserve the heritage and beauty of the capital city,\" Owaisi said.

The proposal must be withdrawn immediately [pic.twitter.com/rhJ02JGHor] [December 28, 2023] Lok Sabha MP from Amroha Danish Ali also raised objections to the proposed removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in the national capital, saying the mosque has historical and archaeological importance.

    "text": "Gervonta Davis will be ringing in the new year with his new Muslim name after formalizing his conversion to Islam. On Sunday (December 24), the boxing champion held his ceremony and revealed he had chosen the name Abdul Wahid, which translates to “The Servant of the One.” Welcome to Islam brother [@Gervontaa]Alhamdulillah [pic.twitter.com/mCQrqRtUZC] — Badou Jack (@BadouJack) [December 24, 2023] Gervonta Davis’ Conversion Goes Viral Several friends, including fellow boxer Bodou Jack, joined Davis at the religious service, who shared moments from the conversion onto X, formerly known as Twitter. In one clip, a man who appears to be an Imam guides Davis as he repeats a prayer after him. Jack captioned the post, writing, “Welcome to Islam brother @Gervontaa Alhamdulillah.” In another widely circulating video on the internet, Davis can be seen seated next to the Imam, who further explains his chosen name and its meaning to the other Muslims in attendance. “It means the servant of the one, from the name of Allah,” he said. “The names of God is Al Wahid, The One, and that’s a beautiful name.” Adapting to his new name, Davis takes a significant step as he continues his religious journey as a Muslim, following a turbulent summer in the headlines. After Gervonta Davis converted to Islam, he chose the muslim name Abdul Wahid which means “Servant of the One” [pic.twitter.com/MZv4d0ZLzl] — Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) [December 28, 2023] Gervonta Davis’ Recent Legal Drama In February, Davis pleaded guilty at a Baltimore courthouse to four counts in the November 2020 car crash that ended up injuring four people, one of whom was pregnant. The judge sentenced him to 90 days of home detention at his trainer’s home in May, 200 hours of community service, and three years probation. But he later checked himself into the Baltimore Four Seasons hotel before moving into a new home, without obtaining permission from the judge, according to [The Baltimore Banner](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/gervonta-davis-home-detention-four-seasons-hotel-silo-point-VVWIJXG3RFBRLGFOLV7STBJXKI/). Consequently, the court determined that Davis had violated his house arrest terms. On June 1, a judge ordered the boxer to serve the remainder of his home detention sentence at the city’s jail. The court ordered the athlete to complete 44 days behind bars at the time of the ruling, per the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-12301013/Boxing-star-Gervonta-Davis-RELEASED-jail-44-days-bars.html). He was released on July 14. Davis’ legal team contended that the home was too small for their client and his security team to serve out his three-month sentence, which prompted him to find a bigger property. However, the reason didn’t justify not informing the judge beforehand. The legal problems ultimately prevented Davis from his boxing career, with the 34-year-old having stayed out of the ring since April when he fought and won his match against Ryan Garcia. It still remains unclear when Davis plans on taking on his next fight.",

    "text": "Man was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple. (Representational) A 41-year-old Indo-Canadian man has been arrested for multiple break-ins and thefts at Hindu temples in Canada's Durham Region and Greater Toronto Area, police said. However, the offences do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate, Durham Regional Police said in a press release on Thursday. The police identified the man as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton city. According to the press release, in the early hours of October 8, police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. Pandher was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. He fled the area before police arrival, it said. He was \"seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,\" the release said. Police say the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. \"These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" they said. Pandher has been charged with four counts of break-and-enter among other charges, the release said.

    "text": "State senator pleads not guilty in Arizona fake electors case By Kyung Lah, Zachary Cohen and Jack Hannah, CNN (CNN) — Arizona state Sen. Jake Hoffman on Thursday pleaded not guilty to multiple felony charges related to the Republican lawmaker’s alleged role in a conspiracy to [overturn the 2020 election results](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/politics/jake-hoffman-indicted-fake-elector-arizona-gop-rnc/index.html). His attorney, Timothy La Sota, entered the plea on his client’s behalf. Hoffman appeared before Court Commissioner Shellie Smith via Zoom – with a painting of Ronald Reagan on a wall behind him – after an Arizona grand jury handed up an indictment against him and 17 other defendants in April. He was charged alongside 10 other individuals who served as fake electors from the state and multiple close allies of former [President Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45). Hoffman, who was [elected](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/politics/jake-hoffman-indicted-fake-elector-arizona-gop-rnc/index.html) as a member of the Republican National Committee for Arizona just days after being indicted in April, told the judge he has plans to travel out of state this summer to attend various pre-planned Republican events. The judge released Hoffman on his own recognizance and will “allow travel for purposes of his employment.” His next court date is a pre-trial hearing set for July 2. Hoffman [sent a two-page letter](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/arizona-fake-electors-kifle-invs/index.html) to Vice President Mike Pence on January 5, 2021, asking him to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of its citizens, but instead by members of the state Legislature. “It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on [January 6, 2021](https://www.cnn.com/politics/capital-riot-investigations), and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” Hoffman wrote at the time. In [interviews,](https://www.temi.com/editor/t/S5qhsIrL7V8Rz4qhNsDk8bVLpOBjy2m7K8NUfLzZJSbjRPnC7MZIl4Caoa95tQf2zLNAvP6GOFMZEnwekq0EO3T3DeQ?loadFrom=Dashboard&openShareModel=False) Hoffman repeatedly argued that no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election” and called to contest Democratic electors if they were sent. Following news of his indictment, Hoffman said in a statement that he was “innocent of any crime,” adding, “I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this disgusting political persecution by the judicial process.” The Arizona Republican Party also condemned the indictment, [calling it](https://twitter.com/AZGOP/status/1783300308317434152) a “blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power.” Others charged in the indictment include former Trump lawyer [John Eastman](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/john-eastman-arizona-not-guilty-plea/index.html), [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/rudy-giuliani-arizona-election-subversion/index.html), former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn. Giuliani and Eastman pleaded not guilty last month. Meadows is scheduled to appear before an Arizona judge Friday. Epshteyn’s first court appearance is slated for June 18.

    "text": "Uno de los momentos clave antes del inicio de la campaña de recogida de aceituna es el día en el que se dan a conocer las primeras estimaciones de producción de aceite de oliva en Andalucía de cara a la futura campaña. Este jueves ha sido instante para ello, con la visita a Jaén del consejero de Agricultura, Pesca, Agua y Desarrollo Rural, Ramón Fernández-Pacheco, que presidido el aforo del olivar. El consejero se ha mostrado optimista por los datos obtenidos, y es que ha señalado que “la presente campaña se ha visto favorecida por las precipitaciones y las temperaturas suaves en primavera, lo que ha contribuido a mejorar parcialmente el estado de las plantaciones”. Se estima que la producción final de aceite de oliva sea un 76,6% superior a la del año pasado, confiando en que se pueda superar el millón de toneladas. Por provincias, Jaén presenta los mejores guarismos, con un aumento del 116% de la producción, respecto a la campaña anterior. Esto nos viene a decir que Jaén podría producir 445.000 toneladas de aceite de oliva, registrando casi la mitad que la cantidad total prevista en la comunidad autónoma. Con Jaén a la cabeza, le siguen Córdoba con 271.000 toneladas, casi un 79% más; y Sevilla en tercer lugar con 125.000 toneladas, un 24% más. El porcentaje de aceite de oliva producido ha aumentado, respecto a la campaña anterior, en todas las provincias, excepto en Almería y Huelva. En cuanto a la aceituna de almazara, se estima una producción de 5.347.700 toneladas en toda Andalucía, de las que 2.100.000 toneladas se producirán en la provincia de Jaén; 1.547.500 en Córdoba; 750.000 toneladas en Sevilla; 516.500 en Granada; 210.000 en Málaga; 132.900 en Cádiz; 48.200 en Huelva y 42.600 toneladas en Almería. Olivar ecológico Respecto al olivar ecológico para la aceituna de almazara es importante destacar que, en los últimos diez años, la superficie de olivar ecológico ha crecido hasta las 134.782 hectáreas en 2023, lo que supone el 8,6% del total del olivar de almazara. Así, según ha detallado el consejero, “cabe esperar que la campaña actual sea un 48,8% superior a la pasada con una producción de 29.230 toneladas de aceite ecológico, siendo Córdoba la principal provincia productora con casi el 54% de Andalucía”. A esta provincia le sigue Sevilla con 5.500 toneladas; Jaén con 4.200; Granada con 1.910, Huelva con 960, Málaga con 390, Almería con 280 y, por último, Cádiz con 230 toneladas de aceite ecológico. Aceituna de mesa En cuanto al aforo de producción de aceituna de mesa, la previsión es que para la campaña 2024/2025 se obtengan 388.487 toneladas de aceituna de mesa, un 18,1% superior a la obtenida en la campaña pasada. “Al igual que ha ocurrido con la aceituna de almazara, la campaña de aceituna de mesa se ha caracterizado por la recuperación de la cosecha gracias a un clima favorable y se espera un aumento de cosecha en todas las provincias”, ha detallado el titular del ramo. Sevilla es la principal provincia productora de aceituna de almazara alcanzando las 280.000 toneladas, con un aumento de producción del 14%; seguida de Córdoba con 62.693 toneladas y un aumento del 35,7% (la que más crece de todas) y Málaga con 38.165 toneladas que, aunque en menor medida, aumenta un 9,8% la producción con respecto a la anterior campaña. Destaca de forma muy destacada Huelva, que sube un 596% y alcanza las 6.980 toneladas y, en el lado opuesto, la provincia de Granada baja la producción un 98% y se sitúa en las 6 toneladas. Olivar de almazara Por otra parte, se espera que el olivar de almazara genere 17,3 millones de jornales, de los cuales el 64,6% se generan en la recolección. Solo en la provincia de Jaén se contabilizan 3,8 millones de jornales en recolección, un 34,2% del total andaluz. Por su parte, en la aceituna de mesa se estiman 3,42 millones de jornales en labores de campo, incluida la recolección, lo que supondría el 62,7%. En este caso, Sevilla será la principal generadora de empleo con 2,47 millones de jornales previstos, más del 72% del total andaluz. Con respecto a las exportaciones, hasta el mes de julio de la campaña 2023/2024 se registraron exportaciones de aceite de oliva desde Andalucía a 127 países, siendo Estados Unidos el principal destino con el 18% del total del aceite exportado. En el mercado de la aceituna de mesa, desde Andalucía se exportó a116 países, siendo de nuevo Estados Unidos el principal país de destino con el 18% del total.
