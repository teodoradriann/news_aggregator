    "title": "Veteran Saints team on same page for deep playoff runs - American Press | American Press",
    "text": "Last season marked the St. Louis Catholic girls soccer team’s first appearance in a state championship game since 2010, and they are trying to build toward another deep playoff run.\nWith eight starters back, including their top two goal scorers and a three-year starter in goal, the Saints (8-3-5) are ranked No. 3 in the Division III Louisiana High School Athletic Association power ratings. They haven’t lost since Dec. 7, a string of 10 games.\n“Going into this year, we’re not trying to restart,” Saints head coach Alex Kjellsten said. “We’re kind of trying to pick up from last year and continue doing the small things well to play for each other and to really mesh together as a team.\n“I think what I’ve seen in the last 10 games is that we aren’t concerned about who gets the goal or who gets to shoot the free kick or the penalty kick. It’s ‘We scored a goal,’ not ‘I scored a goal.’ We did that as a team. We won this game together as a team or we fought together as a team for this game.”\nSt. Louis lost to Parkview Baptist in the final last season on penalty kicks.\nThe Saints are not taking the easy path in their attempt to get back to the final. The Saints have played 10 teams ranked in the top 10 five of the top 10 in Division III.\n“We’ve had some very tough games where we came out with ties and some very tough games that could have gone either way that come out as ties,” Kjellsten said. “And then we have a few that we scraped out some wins and maybe a couple that we got unlucky on and ended up losing those games.\n“But the girls have come a very long way from the beginning of the season. They’ve really meshed up as a team as the season has been going on.”\nJunior goalkeeper Caroline Avery has allowed 10 goals in 16 games and averages three saves a game.\n“She has a lot more confidence and she’s just a super tough goalkeeper,” Kjellsten said. “She’s not afraid to go up in the air and win a ball with girls trying to knock her over She’s not afraid to come out of her goal and slide tackle. She’s not afraid to dive. It’s really cool to see. She’s just a gritty goalkeeper.”\nSenior forward Emma Roach and junior attacking midfielder Addie Flavin combined for 42 goals last season. They lead the Saints with seven and 11 goals, respectively. Junior forward Kylie Pousson has five goals and seven assists, and senior Addison Moreno has five goals. The Saints have been able to spread the ball around with 15 players with at least one goal or assist.\n“Really, we’re kind of spreading the ball all over the field and a lot more players are getting opportunities to shoot the ball, which is great and is what we want to see,” Kjellsten said.\nThe Saints lost district defensive MVP Charlie Maze to graduation but junior Lizzy Mundy has stepped up to lead the backline that includes seniors Anna Cate Flavin and Brooke Miles with Goodwin and Lilly Liles at the defensive midfield positions.\nLooking to the playoffs that start in two weeks, Kjellsten said the Saints are working on strengthening the defense and taking advantage of more scoring opportunities.\n“We’re real trying to shore up our back line, defensive line, and making sure that we’re all on the same page,” Kjellsten said. “That way we stay connected. That when we shift from one side of the field to the other everybody’s supposed to be shifting, and we’re not leaving gaps in our back line.\n“Offensively, throughout the season it’s getting better now. We’ve had multiple opportunities at goals, but sometimes we don’t finish the shots that we need to. So we’ve been working really hard on hitting that ball low and into the corner.”",

    "text": "SAP Rolls Out Technology Training Initiatives Across the Middle East\nSAP University Alliances has launched its Business AI Roadshow in the UAE as the latest in a series of collaborations aimed at equipping young people across the Middle East with in-demand technology skills. The UAE interactive tour – which was launched in collaboration with the SAP Business Women’s Network and in partnership with Deloitte and Zayed University – introduces university students to real-world applications of AI in business while demonstrating how SAP technologies are shaping the future of work.\n\"Through these programs, we’re helping to nurture a new generation of talent that will lead the digital transformation of the region,\" said Marwan Zeineddine, Managing Director of SAP UAE. \"Empowering youth with advanced skills in AI and digital technologies is essential for building the knowledge economies of tomorrow.\"\nAt each stop on the Business AI Roadshow, students participate in live demonstrations and hands-on activities that illustrate the role of AI in solving complex business challenges. The sessions also explore how companies across industries are embedding AI into their core operations. Participating students gain practical insight into how to navigate and thrive in a digital-first workplace.\nThe roadshow builds on the success of SAP's inaugural MENA Learning Tour to the company’s global headquarters in Walldorf, Germany. There, select students from the region’s universities met SAP executives including CEO Christian Klein and gained exposure to cutting-edge innovation through workshops, labs, and career mentorship opportunities. Students were given the opportunity to pitch business cases, explore new approaches to design thinking and agile collaboration, and experience what it is like working at SAP.\nThe response from students was overwhelmingly positive. Mouza Alnuaimi, an Information Technology and Network Security student at Zayed University, UAE, said: “From day one, we were immersed in a learning journey, from Design Thinking sessions on AI to engaging with professional mentors. Living a day alongside SAP employees and experiencing their passion was inspiring.”\nLaunch of SAP Learning Hub for Students\nThese learning initiatives are part of a wider effort by SAP to strengthen links between academia and industry. Central to this is the global launch of the SAP Learning Hub, Student Edition, which offers university students flexible, online access to over 1,500 learning assets including interactive e‑learning courses, expert-led webinars, and hands‑on practice systems. Through the Hub, students can follow curated learning paths aligned to emerging job roles in AI, data analytics, and enterprise resource planning.\nBeyond self‑paced study, the Hub provides exclusive access to community-led study groups and live Q&A sessions with SAP experts, enabling peer collaboration and real‑time feedback. Learners can earn industry-recognized SAP certifications, from Associate to Professional levels, and showcase digital badges on their professional profiles. By democratizing access to cutting-edge SAP content, the Learning Hub empowers students to build in-demand skills and stand out in today’s competitive job market.\nSAP’s education programs support national transformation agendas across the region by helping build digital talent pipelines and by fostering inclusive, innovation-driven economies.\nBackground Information\nSAP\nSAP is at the center of today’s technology revolution. The market leader in enterprise application software, SAP helps organizations fight the damaging effects of complexity, generate new opportunities for innovation and growth, and stay ahead of the competition.\nVisit our corporate site to explore news, information for investors and analysts, career resources, SAP’s history, and more.",

The Congressional Leadership Fund , which is tied to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, is “shifting cash from long-shot targets to more conventional pickup opportunities,” according to Axios , a national political website that is read closely by Washington insiders. kAm{@82? 2?5 k2 9C67lQ9EEADi^^92J6D]9@FD6]8@G^Qm&]$] #6A] y292?2 w2J6Dk^2m 2C6 =@4 2E49 27E6C w2J6D H@?

    "text": "Former WVU head coach named as new IU men’s basketball coach\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - Wednesday, Indiana University announced that former West Virginia head coach Darian DeVries will now roam the sidelines in Bloomington.\nDeVries began his head coaching career at Drake in 2019, where he served for five years before taking over at West Virginia last season. Over his coaching career, DeVries’ teams won 71% of their games, despite the Mountaineers being snubbed from this year’s NCAA Tournament.\nDeVries will be the 31st head coach in IU men’s basketball history and he said he has a vision for moving the program forward.\n“We want to build something that is sustainable for a long period of time and we will do that by staying true to what this program is about,” he said. “We will know when we have made it when every time a fan, a booster, an alumni or a former player comes to watch us play and turns on the TV and after the game is over, that they are filled with pride because they have so much respect for how our team plays, how unselfish they are, they joy they play with and the enthusiasm they play with and their love for this university.”\nDeVries will look to help IU return to its championship-level ways. They haven’t won a National Title since 1987.\nCopyright 2025 WAVE. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Con un rechazo a la guerra despegaron en Nariño los diálogos regionales de paz",
    "text": "Los diálogos regionales de paz en Nariño despegaron este sábado en el municipio de Samaniego, con un angustioso llamado a los grupos armados ilegales de acabar la guerra y al Gobierno Nacional de apostarle a la paz, pero con inversión social. El modelo de paz territorial que se construye en el departamento de Nariño, establece los diálogos regionales y un comisionado regional de paz. Aunque no descartan las autoridades que puede ser un proceso complejo, con un camino difícil por recorrer, pero se parte sobre la firme certeza que existe la voluntad y fe para alcanzar la anhelada paz en la región. Contrario a lo que se podría pensar, los diálogos de paz en Nariño no se van a construir en una mesa, en la que se sientan los representantes del gobierno con los actores armados, para deliberar sobre dejación de armas, indultos u otras refrendaciones. En Nariño, la paz se tejerá desde la voluntad política y social, mediante el impulso del desarrollo territorial, el saldo de la deuda histórica del Estado con los territorios, el apoyo de la cooperación internacional y la ejecución de los proyectos más apremiantes de las comunidades. Este gran anhelo de paz también determina dos formas para hacerlo realidad: el pacto por la transformación del territorio, la vida y la paz y los diálogos territoriales para la paz. El gobernador de Nariño, Luis Alfonso Escobar, en su intervención ante más de 2.000 personas que se dieron cita en el coliseo de esa localidad ubicada al occidente del departamento dijo que “la construcción de paz no es más que el desarrollo, no es más que la confianza que la ciudadanía empieza a tejer con un Estado que ha permanecido ausente del territorio”. Destacó que en Samaniego nació una experiencia local de paz liderada por el ex alcalde, Harold Montufar, y así nacieron otras experiencias de paz en Nariño. “Esta paz va más allá del diálogo con los actores armados, que los convocamos, que los llamados de verdad a que como lo han dicho en este territorio, han dicho que quieren participar de estos diálogos regionales de paz”, manifestó el mandatario seccional. Luego sostuvo que “todos los actores armados pueden ser bienvenidos a ese diálogo con la nación y por supuesto, en la medida de lo posible al diálogo amplio que estamos abriendo con todos los sectores sociales”. Puso de presente que el diálogo por la paz se hace transformando el territorio, y aclaró que “la paz no puede ser un diálogo, una agenda y luego no tengamos cómo cumplirla”. Insistió que esa paz y esa agenda están en el marco de la construcción del plan de desarrollo de Nariño, que está articulado con el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo. Explicó que son dos las rutas que su administración se ha propuesto junto al Gobierno Nacional para alcanzar la paz, la primera que ya tuvo el aval del presidente Gustavo Petro consistente en el pacto por la transformación para la vida y la paz de Nariño, y la segunda son los diálogos regionales de paz que ya despegaron en el municipio de Samaniego. Seguidamente presentó a los asistentes la maqueta de inversiones para la subregión de Guambuyaco y Abades, que incluye en un primer momento a los municipios de La Llanada, Santacruz, Samaniego y Providencia donde se proyecta invertir inicialmente 237 mil millones de pesos. Otty Patiño, Alto Comisionado para la Paz, dijo a quienes persisten en las armas que “somos el testimonio vivo y una promesa que se encarna en un gobierno y en un presidente que cumple lo que promete, que no se desanima con los obstáculos”. “Hoy venimos acá no para soñar, no para hacer promesas, sino para anunciar el nacimiento de un nuevo departamento con cultivos lícitos, con explotaciones mineras cuya propiedad legalizada esté en manos de quienes las están trabajando”, agregó. El alcalde de Samaniego, Armando Andrade, declaró en su corta intervención que “la paz no es solo la ausencia del conflicto, sino la presencia activa de la justicia, la equidad y el respeto por los derechos humanos”. Puso de presente además que “es momento de dejar atrás las divisiones y trabajar unidos en la búsqueda de soluciones que beneficien a toda nuestra comunidad”. A su turno el gobernador del resguardo indígena El Sande, Gabriel Nastacuas, afirmó que la paz hay que construirla con inversión social, “aquí hemos vivido el conflicto, sufrimos el conflicto en los resguardos El Sande y Guachavez pero queremos vivir en paz, ya no queremos más guerra”. Por su otra parte, la gobernadora del resguardo indígena Planadas-Telembí y Montañas, Alexandra Nastacuas, anotó: “estamos prestos y apoyamos la construcción de paz, estamos firmes para esa construcción de paz, pero para eso debe haber inversión social en nuestros territorios, debemos trabajar por nuestras vías, por electrificación y por nuestros jóvenes”. La joven líder aprovechó la ocasión para pedir garantías a los indígenas para su pronto retorno a sus territorios, teniendo en cuenta que completaron más de cinco meses desplazados por los enfrentamientos entre grupos armados ilegales.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

This rejection has raised concerns over the possible closure of two blast furnaces without the financing in place to replace their output, putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk.\nThe rejection is said to be due to the gap between the company’s demands and the government's offer. According to the rumors, the company has requested £1 billion or more.\nThe subsidy was offered for the green transition of the company’s operations.
