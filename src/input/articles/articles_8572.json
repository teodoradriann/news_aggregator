But for many of us, there's a quick fix we can all try out before calling out an emergency plumber. And a considerate plumber has shared the advice which could sort many people's broken boilers this winter as the UK shivers its way into spring, report the [Derby Telegraph](https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/). Martin Broer has been telling customers they may not need a call-out if they try his money-saving advice. The Derby plumber, who runs M Broer Heating, said all you need is a kettle to fix a very common problem. He said: \"We've had a lot of customers calling up with frozen condensate pipes and boilers cutting out.

Now, because there's such a small amount, it can get frozen up inside. \"What you do is boil your trusty kettle and just pour it all over the pipe. Once you've done that it should defrost. Go inside, reset your boiler, and everyone's happy!\" Mr Broer shared a video of the advice on his company's Facebook page and many of his customers thanked him for the trick.",

    "text": "When checking the application log in the Event Viewer, I stumbled upon an Event ID 8193, which implies that there is some issue with the VSS which can hinder in the backup and recovery process of the machine. This might not seem like an important issue, but it can be if your system crashes. In this post, we will talk about VSS Error, Unexpected error calling routine CoCreateInstance and see how you can resolve it.\nVolume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error calling routine CoCreateInstance. hr = 0x8007045b, A system shutdown is in progress.\nFix VSS Error, Unexpected error calling routine CoCreateInstance, Event ID 8193 If you encountered VSS Error, Unexpected error calling routine CoCreateInstance, follow the solutions mentioned below.\nCheck VSS Service Status Re-register VSS Components Check Network Service Account Permissions Repair your system image Let us talk about them in detail.\n1] Check VSS Service Status\nFirst of all, we need to go and check the running status of the VSS Service . This service allows your device to create backup of the files and volumes hosted on it time to time so that they can be recovered after a crash or as per the user’s requirements, therefore, the service should be running all the time.\nOur first step should be to check the service’s status and make sure that it is running, to do so, follow the steps mentioned below.\nOpen the Services app by searching it out of the Start Menu. Now, look for Volume Shadow Copy, right-click on it, and select Properties. Check if the status of the service is Stopped. If it’s not running, change the Startup type to Automatic (Delayed Start) and click on Start. Finally, click Apply > OK. If the service was running, you need to right-click on it and select Restart. Once the service starts back up, you need to reboot your computer and wait for a few hours to check the event logs again. You can add a filter in Event Viewer and make sure that the Source is set to VSS. If you see successful logs, your issue is resolved.\n2] Re-register VSS Components\nThere is a possibility that VSS refuses to work because of a glitch and in order to resolve it, we will manually register server. DLL files that are essential for the Volume Shadow Copy Service to function to ensure that all necessary components are properly registered and available for the VSS to use. In order to do so, you first need to open Run, type “cmd”, and hit Ctrl + Shift + Enter. You will get a UAC pop-up, click on Yes when prompted.\nNow, run the following commands one by one.\nregsvr32 ole32.dll regsvr32 vss_ps.dll regsvr32 /i swprv.dll regsvr32 /i eventcls.dll regsvr32 es.dll regsvr32 stdprov.dll regsvr32 vssui.dll regsvr32 msxml.dll regsvr32 msxml3.dll regsvr32 msxml4.dll\nFinally, reboot your computer and then check if the issue is resolved.\n3] Check Network Service Account Permissions\nThere is similar error, with the same Event ID: 8193 , which says “ Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error calling routine. Access is denied “. This error is usually caused due to the lack of permission to the Diag key. We suspect that the issue that we are facing can also be a product of the same problem. Therefore, we are going to make some changes to the registry in order to resolve the issue. However, before making any changes, we recommend you take a backup of your registry .\nOnce done, follow the steps mentioned below.\nOpen Registry Editor by searching it out of the Start Menu. Now, navigate to Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\VSS\\Diag Right-click on the Diag folder and select Properties. Now, select NETWORK SERVICE option from the Security tab, tick the box associated with Full Control, and click on OK. You can close the Registry Editor. Finally, reboot your computer and see if the issue is resolved.\n4] Repair your system image\nIf any component related to VSS is corrupted on your computer, you will encounter this issue. In order to resolve it, we need to repair the system image, to do so, open the Command Prompt as an administrator and then run the following commands.\nsfc /scannow\nDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth\nDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth\nDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\nMake sure to run one command at a time. Once you are done with these commands, run the backup gain and see if the issue is resolved.\nHopefully, you will be able to resolve the issue using the solutions mentioned in this post.\nRead: The VSS service is shutting down due to idle timeout\nWhat is the VSS unexpected error? If you see VSS Unexpected error and the backup plan terminates, system does not have enough disk space to create a shadow copy during a backup. You need to increase the area allowed to VSS to buffer such write operations. We recommend you increase the max size of VSS and then retry, hopefully, it will work.\nRead: Fix VSS Error Code 0x8004231f, Failed to create Volume Snapshot\nHow do I check my VSS settings? To check your VSS Settings, open Command Prompt as an administrator. Then, list all the VSS writers and then current state, run vssadmin list writers, to list all installed VSS providers, run vssadmin list providers, and to list out all existing shadow copies, run vssadmin list shadows.\nAlso Read: 0x80042314L, VSS encountered problems while sending events to writers .",

    "text": "By Donnie Burgess ,\n4 hours ago\nSource: Kent Nishimura / Getty\nWASHINGTON — The right to use an abortion pill called mifepristone has been protected by the United States Supreme Court.\nIn a unanimous decision Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a group of anti-abortion doctors did not have any legal standing to sue the Food and Drug Administration in an attempt to have mifepristone access restricted. Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in a “medication” abortion.\n“Under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff’s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue,” wrote Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\nThe pill is typically mailed to patients without an in-person doctor visit and is considered safe by the FDA. The FDA warns people should only obtain the drug from an authorized medical provider and not over the Internet.\nDestiny Wells, Democrat candidate for Indiana Attorney General, says this decision protects abortion access.\n“Since I returned home from serving in Afghanistan in 2017, I realized more than ever that women are the barometer of a healthy democracy,” Wells said in a Thursday press release, “as Attorney General, I will stand by each Hoosier’s ability to determine their healthcare decisions—today’s SCOTUS decision preserving access to lifesaving medication is a win for American liberty.”\nIndiana has a near-total ban on abortion with exceptions for rape, incest, and/or the mother’s life is in danger.\nThe post Abortion Pill Challenge Overruled by U.S. Supreme Court appeared first on WIBC 93.1 FM .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Her father owned and operated the Ourtown Cheese\nFactory which was a block away from the school. Bob’s father worked at Kohler Company and lived two\nmiles away from the school. There were no school buses in those days so Bob’s father would drop Evelyn\noff at the cheese factory until school started. After Bob’s honorable discharge (received his wings as a\npilot), she then moved to Madison, Wisconsin to work for Lumbermans Supply while Bob went to the\nUniversity of Wisconsin under the GI Bill. They got married while Bob was a senior in school. After\nBob’s graduation, they moved to Sheboygan where they had purchased a home from her father under a\nland contract. She became a homemaker and they joined the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer. They\nboth were active in the church where she became president and treasurer of the Ladies Guild and member\nof LWML. She was active in forming a homemakers group called the Mapletts, a Braille packaging group\nat the Immanuel Lutheran Church, and did volunteer work at the Bethesda Thrift Store. She had many\nfriends and enjoyed playing golf (she even had a hole in one) plus bowling in two leagues. She was a\ncharter member of the Pink Ladies team, a part of the Kohler Golf League. She also enjoyed cooking,\ncraft work, gardening, flowers and playing bridge. Evelyn and Bob loved to travel and did several\nElderhostel trips and had visited most of the states along with several foreign countries. They toured\nEngland, Norway, Sweden, Germany several times to visit many relatives, France, Switzerland, Russia\nand China.\nEvelyn is survived by her husband Bob, sons Larry (MaryJo) Schroeder and Gary (Carol) Schroeder;\ngrandchildren Jessica (Jim) Bosovic and Jason (Andrea) Schroeder; great-grandchildren Lily and Cara;\nnephews Rick and Ken (Tina) Yurk and niece Kay Yurk. She is preceded in death by her parents, Edwin\nand Lilly (Erdman) Lupinski; Uncle Louie and Aunt Mae.\nFamily and friends may gather at St. Paul Lutheran Church, 730 Cty Rd PPP Sheboygan Falls, WI, on\nTuesday, January 2, 2024 from 1:00pm – 2:00pm. A funeral service will immediately follow at 2:00pm,\nwith Pastor Robert Schrader officiating. Burial at Lutheran Cemetery, Sheboygan will be private.\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to The Gathering Place (St. Paul Lutheran Church,\nSheboygan Falls).\nBob would like to thank the nurses who took care of Evelyn in various areas at Pine Haven. He would\nalso like to give a special thanks to their sons and family; Barbara Wagner; David Klunk; Tiffany Perl;\nKenric Hietala and for all those who prayed for Evelyn during her many years with glaucoma causing her\nblindness.\nPlease visit our website to share your stories and leave your condolences for the family at\nwww.ballhornchapels.com.",

Sin embargo, el final del encuentro se vio empañado por un escándalo cuando los jugadores de ambos equipos se enfrentaron en una violenta pelea .\nLa tensión se desató tras el pitido final, y varios jugadores se agredieron físicamente en el campo de juego , lo que resultó en expulsiones y un clima de alta tensión que el árbitro neuquino Darío Herrera debió manejar .\nEmbed - https://publish.twitter.com/oembed?url=https://x.com/TyCSports/status/1826741579845157328&partner=&hide_thread=false ¡FINAL A LAS PIÑAS ENTRE EL LOBO Y BARRACAS CENTRAL!\nConsumado el triunfo de #Gimnasia , jugadores de ambos equipos se cruzaron a golpes dentro del campo de juego. #CopaArgentinaEnTyCSports pic.twitter.com/iojURBKq7P\n— TyC Sports (@TyCSports) August 22, 2024 Yonathan Cabral y Jonathan Candia fueron los jugadores que resultaron expulsados tras la pelea que se desató en el campo de juego. Previamente Juan Cortazzo había visto la tarjeta roja durante el tiempo reglamentario por un planchazo cuando el reloj marcaba 90', tras haber ingresado tan solo 7 minutos antes.\nBenja Domínguez y una despedida ideal en Gimnasia de La Plata El delantero de Gimnasia disputó su último partido con la camiseta del club de sus amores. Fue vendido en las últimas horas al Bologna de Italia en una transferencia que incluye que el club argentino percibirá 4.500.000 euros por el cien por ciento de su ficha, con la posibilidad de llegar a los seis millones por objetivos. Además el Lobo conservará una plusvalía del 15% sobre una futura venta.\nDomínguez marcó el gol de la victoria con un remate de zurda tras la asistencia de Ramiro Castillo . En el festejo se lo notó visiblemente emocionado a \"Benja\", que con apenas 20 años es la última joya de la institución del Bosque.\nEmbed - https://publish.twitter.com/oembed?url=https://x.com/TyCSportsPlay/status/1826729675789357162&partner=&hide_thread=false ¡GOLAZO DEL LOBO!

Central Córdoba enfrentará en cuartos de final a Temperley, buscando clasificar a las semifinales del certamen.\nEn un primer tiempo con bastante acción, la primera jugada de riesgo fue para Central Córdoba, cuando el extremo Luis Angulo dejó mano a mano al centrodelantero Lucas Varaldo, pero su remate fue bloqueado por el defensor Angelo Martino.\nA los 15 minutos llegó Newell’s por primera vez. Después de un tiro libre, tanto el extremo Lucas Besozzi como el delantero Juan Ramírez quedaron mano a mano ante Ingolotti, pero el arquero tapó ambos remates.\nA los 38 minutos del segundo tiempo, Angulo fue habilitado por el mediocampista Kevin Vázquez pero su remate, a pesar de estar mano a mano, se fue ancho.\nSiete minutos después, Milijevic recibió un centro en el medio del área grande y libre de marca pero su cabezazo fue débil y centralizado, por lo que fue rechazado por Ingolotti.\nEl segundo tiempo no contó con tantas llegadas como el primero, con solamente un tiro libre lejano de Matko Milijevic, que fue desviado al córner por Luis Ingolotti, sobre su palo derecho.\nYa en los penales, el arquero de Central Córdoba se erigió como la figura del partido. Contuvo los remates de Gabriel Carabajal y Gustavo Velázquez , ambos fueron remates bajos y al palo derecho del arquero, y el remate desviado de Milijevic le dio al equipo santiagueño la clasificación a cuartos de final.\nTe puede interesar...\nNo para: quién es el máximo goleador de la Copa Argentina que no deja de meterla\nQué tiene que pasar para que Cipo mantenga la categoría el próximo domingo\nLo más leído\nBuenos Aires Voraz incendio en una refinería de YPF en Ensenada\ntribunales Crimen narco en la Autovía Norte: quiénes irán a juicio y la cámara oculta que los complica\nCAUSA JUDICIAL La exsecretaria de Alberto dijo que las capturas de pantalla son de mensajes reales de Fabiola\nruta 237 Llueven las multas ilegales del radar de Villa El Chocón: la Muni despejó todas las dudas\nRecibí las noticias del día en tu e-mail * Campo requerido Leé más\nNo para: quién es el máximo goleador de la Copa Argentina que no deja de meterla\nQué tiene que pasar para que Cipo mantenga la categoría el próximo domingo\n¿Roma o Arabia Saudita?: Paulo Dybala ya tomó una decisión",

No obstante, la situación generó más de 250 llamadas al call center de Defensa Civil, de las cuales 140 fueron servicios atendidos. \"Hemos tenido en su mayoría árboles caídos y postes inclinados o caídos que han sido asistidos y están siendo asistidos en este momento\", agregó.\nA pesar de los inconvenientes, Vignetta destacó que no hubo \"personas lesionadas ni evacuados\". Sin embargo, se reportaron tres voladuras de techos en distintos barrios: \"uno en barrio Carbó, uno en barrio Artigas y uno en barrio General Mosconi\".\nEl funcionario también valoró el papel del Observatorio Hidrometeorológico de Córdoba, que permitió anticipar el fenómeno: \"Eso nos permitió suspender algunos eventos en la vía pública que eran eventos abiertos y en la vía pública, seguramente eso hubiera originado inconvenientes importantes\".\nEn cuanto a la circulación, la Costanera, este viernes está habilitada en ambas manos y no se registran cortes de calles. \"Podemos decir que ha sido muy oportuno el informe previo del observatorio\", concluyó Vignetta.\nLas áreas más afectadas incluyeron a [Río Cuarto](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Río Cuarto), [Coronel Moldes](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Coronel Moldes) y [Reducción](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Reducción), donde se reportaron daños materiales significativos.\nPablo Cassinerio, secretario general de Desarrollo Social, explicó también que la tormenta causó \"bastante lluvia, calles anegadas y vientos intensos\" en Río Cuarto, lo que resultó en la caída de numerosos árboles y cortes de energía.\n/Inicio Código Embebido/\n/Fin Código Embebido/\nEl ministro de Gobierno, Manuel Calvo, anunció una asistencia inmediata de 20 millones de pesos para hacer frente a la situación. Además, la ministra LauraJure se encuentra en contacto con el intendente de Río Cuarto, Guillermo De Rivas, para coordinar el envío de ayuda, que incluye \"tapas, colchas, colchones y módulos para ayudar a aquellas viviendas precarias\".\nEn cuanto a los daños, Cassinerio informo en diálogo con Cadena 3 que \"más de la mitad de la ciudad de Río Cuarto estaba sin energía eléctrica\" y que, aunque el servicio se está reponiendo, todavía hay sectores que permanecen sin luz. \"Calculamos que ahora en las primeras horas de la mañana ya va a estar totalmente restituido el servicio eléctrico\", añadió.\nOtros lugares afectados incluyen [Las Higueras](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Las Higueras), [Charras](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Charras), [Achiras ](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Achiras)y [Buchardo](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Buchardo), donde se reportaron postes caídos. En Villa del Dique, un techo del galpón municipal voló y cayó sobre algunas viviendas, aunque \"no hemos tenido ninguna persona lesionada ni víctimas\", destacó Cassinerio.\nA pesar de la intensidad de la tormenta, que incluyó \"mucho viento, lluvia y granizo importante\", la situación en la Ciudad de Córdoba no reporta daños severos. Sin embargo, algunos sectores siguen sin servicio de energía eléctrica.\nLas autoridades mantienen la alerta meteorológica activa y continúan en comunicación con las áreas de defensa civil de las municipalidades para anticiparse a cualquier eventualidad. \"Es importante poder adelantarnos a cualquier situación\", concluyó Cassinerio.\nEn cuanto al estado de las rutas, durante la tormenta se reportó un corte entre [Yacanto](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Yacanto) y [Santa Rosa de Calamuchita](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Santa Rosa de Calamuchita) debido a caídas de árboles. “Los bomberos de Yacanto y Santa Rosa acudieron al lugar y están tratando de habilitar la ruta”, informó Schreiner. Además, la ruta 28 se mantuvo cortada por desmoronamientos, lo que podría agravar la situación con las lluvias actuales.\nEn[ Coronel Moldes](https://www.cadena3.com/pagina/tag/?q=Coronel Moldes), la intensa tormenta de granizo y lluvia generó serios inconvenientes. El intendente, Ezequiel Moiso, brindó a Cadena 3 detalles sobre la situación actual, destacando que, a pesar de los problemas, no se registraron evacuaciones. \"Tenemos un panorama complicado, pero, gracias a Dios, solamente fue un susto grande\", afirmó Moiso.\nEl intendente explicó que se asistió a varias viviendas afectadas por el ingreso de agua, resultado del mal estado de los techos y los fuertes vientos. \"No tengo a ciencia exacta la cantidad de milímetros que ha llovido, pero algunos hablan de 90 y otros, de 100 milímetros juntos\", indicó. Además, mencionó que la localidad está en la trayectoria del desagüe de Sampacho, lo que contribuyó a la acumulación de agua en los canales.\nMoiso también se refirió a la gran cantidad de granizo que cayó en la zona, describiendo el tamaño de las piedras: \"Pocas piedras de un tamaño de huevo de paloma, pero granizo a montones\". Este fenómeno meteorológico provocó daños en algunos techos, que ya estaban comprometidos por tormentas anteriores. \"Terminó el trabajo que había iniciado en las otras tormentas\", agregó.\nEl intendente confirmó que el mayor inconveniente se debió a la acumulación de granizo en las canaletas, que alcanzó los 50 centímetros de altura. \"Colapsaron lo que en los techos de chapa se ganó y hubo sectores donde ingresó el agua\", explicó Moiso, quien también destacó que sólo se registró agua en el piso.\nTe puede interesar\nTiempo inestable\nSigue este viernes el mal clima en varias zonas del país.
