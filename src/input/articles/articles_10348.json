    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "A woman in her 90s was rescued from beneath the rubble of a collapsed house Saturday in western Japan, five days after a powerful earthquake struck the region and killed more than 126 people. The woman, who has not been identified, had been trapped beneath the first floor of the two-story structure in the town of Suzu after the 7.56 magnitude earthquake rocked the area, The New York Times reported. She was rescued at about 8:20 p.m. local time and was taken to an area hospital, according to the officer of Ishikawa Prefecture. The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the woman was responsive but was believed to be suffering from hypothermia, the BBC reported. On Sunday, a doctor told reporters that the woman was well enough to speak, but her legs were injured, according to CNN . Kume Takanori, a member of the emergency rescue team, told NHK that the woman’s knees had been stuck under furniture between the first and second floor, CNN reported. It took hours to free her, Takanori said. The Times , citing experts, reported that the window for finding survivors after an earthquake is typically three days. It is possible to survive for longer periods, depending on access to water and food, temperatures in the area and the extent of the person’s injuries. The death toll from the earthquake continues to rise, with at least 222 people still reported as missing, according to the newspaper. Wajima city has had the highest number of fatalities, with 69, The Guardian reported. Suzu has 38 deaths. © 2024 Cox Media Group",

    "text": "Payment processing giant Stripe is reportedly in the final stages of talks to acquire Bridge, a Sequoia-backed company that focuses on moving money using stablecoins , with a potential deal valued at around $1 billion.\nIf finalized, this acquisition would mark Stripe’s largest to date. The deal, however, is not yet certain, as both parties could still withdraw, according to Bloomberg.\nBridge, co-founded by former executives from Square and Coinbase, integrates stablecoins like USDC and USDT into traditional financial systems, enabling cross-border payments and currency exchanges. The Texas-based firm has gained traction through partnerships like the one with Bitso for business-to-business payments in Latin America.\nStripe initially became a leader in the crypto space when it introduced Bitcoin payment support in 2014. However, it discontinued the feature in 2018, citing declining demand, long transaction times, higher fees, and price volatility. The company reintroduced crypto payments last week, supporting USDC stablecoin transactions on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon networks.\nPaxos also announced that Stripe will be the first PSP to integrate its new enterprise-grade stablecoin payments platform. Stripe’s “Pay with Crypto” product , which enables businesses to accept stablecoin payments, will feature Paxos’ technology, allowing these payments to settle in fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar.\nStripe already supports pay-ins from over 70 countries, and the inclusion of stablecoin payments will enable businesses to accept payments from anywhere globally.\nAdditionally, Stripe has been integrating crypto services in recent months, including collaborations with Coinbase and the launch of crypto purchasing options for European vendors.\nBridge recently secured $58 million in funding from investors like Sequoia and Ribbit, reflecting the increasing interest in stablecoin-based payment solutions.\nThe stablecoin market has seen rapid growth, with a total market value surpassing $170 billion in September 2024. Major players like Tether (USDT), Circle (USDC), and PayPal (PYUSD) continue to dominate the space.",

    "text": "New bill prevents children under 16 from having social media accounts TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCJB) - One day after the House overwhelmingly passed the bill, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo on Thursday backed a proposal that seeks to prevent children under age 16 from having social media accounts and said the Senate will start moving forward with it. The House on Wednesday voted 106 to 13 to pass the bill, with supporters saying social media harms children’s mental health and can be used by sexual predators to communicate with children. Opponents argue the bill is unconstitutional and that parents should decide whether children use social media. It was not immediately clear Thursday when Senate committees would take up the issue, but Passidomo says the bill will be heard. “We are going to take up the bill. I don’t know if members are going to suggest proposed changes. If they do, I’m certainly going to discuss it with the speaker. It’s his initiative, and I support it fully,” said State Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, R- Senate President. The bill would prevent minors under 16 from creating social media accounts and would require social media platforms to terminate existing accounts that are “reasonably known” by the platforms to be held by children younger than 16. It also would allow parents to request that minors’ accounts be terminated. State Representative Tyler Sirois is the House bill sponsor. “These companies’ business model is the exploitation of behavioral tendencies. Put differently, they are just taking advantage of kids growing up. That is their business model,” said State Rep. Tyler Sirois, R- Merritt Island. The bill would require platforms to use independent organizations to conduct age verifications when new accounts are created and would require denial of accounts for people who do not verify their ages. The organizations would be required to delete the data after ages are verified. Meta, the parent company of platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, and the industry groups NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association have publicly criticized the bill and argued that it would violate First Amendment rights.
