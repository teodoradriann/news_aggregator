    "text": "[Stock Market](../) Dow scores another all-time high as S&P 500 remains just shy of record territory U.S. stocks finished mostly higher on Thursday with the S&P 500 closing just shy of record territory as the large-cap index heads for its best December since 2010. How stocks traded - The S&P 500 [SPX](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) gained 1.77 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 4,783.35. - The Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) rose by 53.58 points, or 0.1%, to 37,710.10. - The Nasdaq Composite [COMP](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) shed 4.04 points, or less than 0.1%, to 15,095.14. What drove markets U.S. stocks continued their advance during the penultimate trading session of 2023, with the Dow logging a fresh record close. The blue-chip gauge is on track to score its biggest December gain since 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Amid low trading volume, the S&P 500 notched its highest close since notching its highest-ever closing level of 4,796.56, set on Jan. 3, 2022. The index is up 5% so far in December, its best December performance since it gained 6.5% in December 2010, Dow Jones Market Data shows. Traders will be watching closely on Friday, the final trading session of 2023, to see if the S&P 500 can finish off what has been a wild year for stocks with a record. “We’re within [12] points [of the January 2022 closing high] here, so we’ll see if we make a run either today or tomorrow,” said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, parent company of brokerage Tastytrade, in an interview with MarketWatch. “Seems hard to believe that we wouldn’t test it before the year is out.” Both stocks and bonds have benefited from expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates aggressively next year. Rate-cut hopes and signs that the U.S. economy is headed for a soft landing have helped drive a 24.6% advance for the S&P 500 since the start of 2023, FactSet data show. Equity investors have also welcomed a recent sharp decline in benchmark borrowing costs, as the 10-year Treasury yield [BX:TMUBMUSD10Y](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/TMUBMUSD10Y?countryCode=BX&mod=MW_story_quote) has fallen from more than 5% at its October peak to about 3.8% this week. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Sentiment got a boost this week from strong auctions of U.S. government 2-year [BX:TMUBMUSD02Y](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/TMUBMUSD02Y?countryCode=BX&mod=MW_story_quote) and 5-year bonds [BX:TMUBMUSD05Y](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/TMUBMUSD05Y?countryCode=BX&mod=MW_story_quote) on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, evidence that the market is relaxed with Treasury yields at the lower levels. But the streak of strong auctions came to an end on Thursday, when a sale of $40 billion in 7-year notes [BX:TMUBMUSD07Y](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/TMUBMUSD07Y?countryCode=BX&mod=MW_story_quote) showed weaker demand than expected. U.S. stock indexes touched their lowest levels of the day after the results were posted at 1 p.m. Eastern time while Treasury yields ticked higher. Looking ahead, some analysts are wondering whether investors may have jumped the gun by pricing in so many Fed interest-rate cuts next year. Some fear this could mean stocks are due for a pullback should expectations shift again. “If global equity markets have one Achilles’ heel going into January 2024, it is the expectation that the Fed will be methodically and consistently cutting interest rates throughout the year,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. As for U.S. economic data released Thursday, investors focused on a weekly jobless-claims report which showed the number of Americans applying for benefits [had risen for a second-straight week.](//www.marketwatch.com/story/jobless-claims-rise-for-second-straight-week-09add036?mod=mw_latestnews) Initial jobless claims rose by 12,000, to 218,000, in the week ended Dec. 23, according to Labor Department data. A report on the U.S. trade deficit in goods [showed it had widened 0.8% to $90.3 billion in November,](//www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-trade-deficit-in-goods-widens-in-november-for-third-straight-month-7167eb64?mod=mw_latestnews) according to an advanced estimate from the Commerce Department. Finally, pending home-sales data showed [sales were flat in November](//www.marketwatch.com/story/pending-home-sales-flat-in-november-despite-drop-in-mortgage-rates-11e23e17?mod=mw_latestnews) compared with the previous month. Companies in focus - Apple Inc. [AAPL,](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote) +0.22% finished marginally higher after winning a court victory that will allow it to temporarily continue selling its newest Apple Watches. - Alibaba Holding Group [BABA,](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/BABA?mod=MW_story_quote) +1.48% finished slightly lower after a U.S. court ruled it must face a lawsuit filed by an American toy maker. - Shares of Mullen Automotive [MULN,](//www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MULN?mod=MW_story_quote) +28.36% traded higher on news after it delivered an order of EV cargo vans.

    "title": "Aussie cricket boss says there could be just THREE Test playing nations left in 10 years as franchise T20 cricket threatens future of the Boxing Day Test",
    "text": "There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely.\nWhile crowd numbers continue to dwindle at Test matches, T20 cricket continues to surge globally.\nIt received the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) seal of approval to be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Games while The International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates became the latest big money tournament in an already cluttered calendar.\nMajor League Cricket also launched in the United States, backed by Microsoft and Adobe. However it is the surge of franchise T20 cricket that could drive the final nail into Test cricket.\nSparse crowds have begun to plague cricket in Australia, with Marnus Labuschagne pictured in front of bays of empty seats against South Africa in January, 2023\nNathan Lyon took his milestone 500th Test wicket in front of bays of empty seats at Optus Stadium in Perth against Pakistan in the first Test\nSouth Africa has also struggled to bring the crowds in for their Boxing Day Test blockbuster against India – which they won\nThe owners of eight of the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises also own at least one team in another foreign competition, with that number set to expand in the coming years.\nIt would create a situation where players would need to choose between T20 riches or representing their nation, with no room in the schedule to do both.\nThat would mean only the most financially viable Test nations would be left standing, potentially meaning only Australia, England and India play the five-day game in the near future.\nIt is not fearmongering or hyperbole, it is a real fear, Australian Cricketer’s Association Todd Greenberg said.\n‘My message is, we’re under pressure,’ he told News Corp.\n‘Pressure might be a good thing, because it will lift all of our opportunities up and make us the best we can be, but other countries are really struggling,\n‘And we can’t play against ourselves. So I’d like to think that Test cricket is more than just Australia, England and India in 10 years’ time.\n‘We want to make sure that Pakistan and South Africa and New Zealand and others can continue to play against us.\n‘I worry that countries like South Africa and New Zealand in 10 years time may no longer be able to afford to have their best players playing and disappearing because of the push and pull of global leagues.\n‘So that is a concern. And I don’t think I’m being an alarmist. I think I’m being a realist.’\nAustralian Cricketers Association boss Todd Greenberg, pictured with his wife Lisa, believes Australia has to help battling nations stay relevant in Test cricket\nAt present, Australia has seen the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and even renowned short-form specialist Glenn Maxwell shun the riches of franchise cricket to focus on their country.\nHowever with gun players turning down playing for their nation in other countries, Greenberg is aware that situation could change very quickly in Australia.\n‘We’re already seeing countries all over the world and particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, where that’s already happening,’ he said.\n‘And so my message is, it’s not happening here at the moment, and it might not feel like it’s gonna happen here at the moment, but it’s happening in other countries in our sport.\n‘So we’d be crazy not to think that those pressures aren’t going to be applied to us at some point in time. So we’ve got to have this conversation now. Make sure we’re ready,’ Greenberg said.\nMajor League Cricket in the United States is the latest T20 league to appear in an already cluttered calendar\nThe IPL continues to go from strength to strength and now franchises are looking to own international clubs – which could mean players are contracted all-year round\nGreenberg is not the only cricket identity forewarning the death of Test cricket.\nEnglish cricket icon David ‘Bumble’ Lloyd said the death of Test cricket would come within a decade back in 2022.\n‘Where will they put it? There’s no room for Test cricket as we know it, and my guess is that in future we will only see the iconic series: like the Ashes, England vs West Indies and England vs India,’ he wrote for Sportsmail.\nEngland cricket coach Brendon McCullum, who has been the architect of Bazball in a bid to revive Test cricket, also previously warned that the long-form of the game was at risk if England was not competitive.\n‘Test cricket has always been the pinnacle for me,’ he said in an interview with the ECB. ‘But the popularity of it has somewhat trended south of late.\n‘So if Test cricket is to not just to sustain but thrive it needs England playing an attractive brand of cricket which is competitive with Australia, India and New Zealand.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",
