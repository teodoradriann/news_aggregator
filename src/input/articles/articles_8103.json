    "title": "Pope Francis Accused of Heresy After Calling the Human Heart “good”",
    "text": "Pope Francis has drawn accusations of heresy after a recent\n“60 Minutes” interview with Norah O’Donnell showed him calling the human heart “good.” After discussing women in the church and the Pope’s blessing of homosexual individuals, O’Donnell asked the Pope what gives him hope. Pope Francis responded (translated from Spanish) saying “Everything. You see tragedies, but you also see so many beautiful things. You see heroic mothers, heroic men, men who have hopes and dreams, women who look to the future. That gives me a lot of hope. People want to live. People forge ahead. And people are fundamentally good. We are all fundamentally good. Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good.”\nThe Pope’s words fly in the face of traditional Christian doctrine, which teaches that humanity lives in a fallen state of sin, unable to redeem itself, and requiring a perfect sacrifice in the form of Jesus Christ, the only perfect and sinless man. It also goes against Jeremiah 17:9 which states “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?” and Jesus’s words in Mark 10:18 when he expresses that none are good except God.\nX did add context to the Pope’s words, noting he had said “somos un poco pícaros y pecadores,” which literally means “we are a little bit rogues and sinners” rather than “some rogues and sinners.” That does not address, however, the idea that people or the heart are fundamentally good. “If this is true, we don’t need a Savior to die on the Cross. So this pope is a heretic,” Eric Metaxas, who comments on Christianity and culture, wrote on https://x.com/ericmetaxas/status/1792534393883373859. “This is core to Christianity. Because if everyone is basically good, the gospel is not good news. If the gospel is not good news, what’s the point?” wrote “Relatable” podcast host Allie Beth Stuckey.\nOther users on X accused the Pope of heresy, calling his viewpoint Pelagianism, so named after Pelagius, a fifth century Catholic monk who was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for teaching that humanity is inherently good.\nAl Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, had strong words against the Pope. After declaring the papacy an “unbiblical office,” Mohler called Pope Francis a contradiction. “We’re talking about a man who now inhabits that office who is the contradiction of at least many of the claims made by the Roman Catholic Church. He’s not the defender of even those Roman Catholic doctrines. Well, he relativizes them. He emotionalizes them.” After affirming that the Bible calls the heart “desperately wicked,” Mohler stated that the Pope’s abandonment of Scripture was similar to liberal Protestant churches that have abandoned established doctrine. “One lesson here is that theological liberalism ends up as the same mush, whether it’s Catholic mush or Protestant mush. It’s mush,” he concluded.",

    "text": "[News](https://newsday.co.tt/category/news) Tancoo wants details of probe into public accounts error [Sean Douglas](https://newsday.co.tt/reporter/sean-douglas) DAVENDRANATH TANCOO, MP for Oropouche West, wants details of the team due to investigate the imbroglio over the Government's withholding of the public accounts and the related Auditor General's report, he said at a televised UNC briefing on April 5. He also said by law, Finance Minister Colm Imbert must lay the accounts and report in Parliament by May 23. While the accounts and the report were listed as items on two recent parliamentary order papers, the Government did not actually present them but said they must be revised due to a $2.6 billion omission from revenues. Attorney General Reginald Armour, SC, said previously top ministry officials – permanent secretary, comptroller of accounts and Treasury director – had asked Auditor General Jaiwantie Ramdass to accept documents towards making corrections. In each House of Parliament, the Government has passed motions to allow more time for the accounts and the report to be submitted to Parliament. Ramdass has defended her position, as an independent office-holder under the Trinidad and Tobago Constitution. It is being argued whether or not the Government had backdated the amended accounts, wrongly. Tancoo alleged a \"sinister agenda\" of bullying of office-holders – the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Integrity Commission, Police Service Commission, Procurement Regulator, and now Auditor General. He accused the Government of a \"reprehensible and vile abuse\" of Parliament over Ramdass. Of the pending probe, he said, \"I call on the Minister of Finance to immediately tell this country, the names of the investigators appointed, how they were selected, their terms of reference and the cost to the taxpayer for this frivolous exercise.\" Tancoo said two months after the legal deadline for submissions, Imbert told Ramdass they had found they had made a massive error of $3.379 billion. The MP noted this was not a $5 bill lost in one's pants' pocket, but billions in taxpayers money. Tancoo said Imbert's same memo strangely said they had reconciled $2.589 billion. Tancoo calculated this meant the Government had not reconciled $781 million. However, he also wondered why they could not provide evidence of the $3.379 billion. \"The Minister of Finance and his Attorney General have tried to make this fiasco about the Auditor General. It is not. It is about multiple errors by the Ministry of Finance under Colm Imbert, and the attempt to cover it up.\" He said Ramdass said she was unable to get the appropriate audit evidence to justify the increased revenue the Government was asking her to write in her report. \"Why didn’t the Ministry of Finance produce the relevant financial records and supporting documentary evidence of the claims they were making of a multi billion dollar increase in revenue?\" Saying that instead, the Government sent her a pre-action protocol letter, Tancoo sighed, \"You cannot make this stuff up!\" He asked where was the $781 million, accusing the Government of venom and spite against Ramdass. \"All the song, dance, bullying and pre-action and yet no supporting documents!\" That sum could have fixed every road in Trinidad and Tobago; provided life-saving surgery to every man, woman or child in need; bolstered police strength; or cleared water-courses ahead of flood season, Tancoo said. Saying Ramdass said the Finance Ministry did not provide documentation for $1 billion in spending, Tancoo said, \"What was this money spent on? Why is there no paper trail?\" He said the Auditor General's job is not to rubber stamp the Government's demands. \"Her job is not to close her eyes and just change figures because Imbert woke up and decided that he didn’t like the figures.\" Tancoo asked for the names of legal counsel who have advised Imbert. \"I call on Minister of Finance to tell this country how much has been paid too date, for what and what is the anticipated total cost of this excursion of his. The country deserves answers. \"This is not a mere accounting error, this is a full scale attack on an office and an individual for doing the right thing in the best interest of you the people.\" Tancoo used the occasion to lament the shooting of 12 people at Cocorite on May 4, of whom four died, and lamented the unresolved murders of former senator Dana Seetahal, SC, (who died exactly ten years ago) and businesswoman/philanthropist Vindra Naipaul.",

    "text": "It wasn’t long ago that large groups of African asylum seekers could be seen routinely sleeping on the sidewalks outside the City of Toronto’s Streets To Homes assessment and referral centre on Peter Street. The large and sudden influx of migrants in need compounded the pressure on an already-overflowing shelter system.\nThousands of those refugees were saved from the streets by volunteers at three Toronto-based churches, Revivaltime Tabernacle, Dominion Church International and Pilgrim Feast Tabernacles.\nThey did what they could to serve hungry refugees, but as the months passed, the expenses became too great to bear for the amount of assistance they received.\nRevivaltime shut down its shelter operation in September, while Dominion sent its last batch of asylum seekers off to temporary spaces with the help of the federal government shortly before Christmas.\nPilgrim Feast Tabernacle continues its effort but on a far smaller scale.\nStory continues below advertisement “Because no more funds [are] coming, we’re downsizing,” explained Executive Director Nadine Miller. Miller and volunteers have done 15-hour shifts, cooking for, cleaning, feeding and clothing an estimated 1,000-1,500 asylum seekers over the last six months, at times allowing hundreds of them to live inside the small church’s premises.\nMore on Toronto Metrolinx unveils changes to UP Express, regional trains and buses Durham man accused of planning ‘sexual acts’ with woman and her 2 young children Dump truck driver charged after pedestrian killed crossing street in Toronto Toronto ‘triple threat’ teen inspires as world-class athlete, dancer and actress That number is down to just over 30 residents now. Two white buses could be seen outside the church’s front door on Albion Road near Islington Avenue Thursday afternoon. The buses, chartered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada transported just over 50 migrants from Pilgrim Feast to hotels in Niagara Falls. In previous weeks they’ve taken others to temporary spaces in Windsor and Mississauga.\nGet the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. “The church was never meant to do this,’ said Miller, pointing out that they’ve managed to help care for refugees on a combination of dwindling donations and their own expenditures, which they have been told are not fully reimbursable by the city.\n“I’m not looking for a medal from the government of Canada, but what I am looking for is financial help … I need the government to decide they want to speak to us. They need our help. We need their help. Let’s work together.”\nAnswering questions via email, City of Toronto spokesperson Russell Baker told Global News, “As of December 17, the City was supporting 11,181 people – 9,370 people in the shelter system and 1,811 people outside the shelter system in bridging hotels and programs supported by the Canadian Red Cross. Of these, 5,372 are refugee claimants – or 48 per cent of the total number of people being supported.”\nStory continues below advertisement Baker wrote that the City gave Revivaltime, Pilgrim Feast and Dominion $50,000 each in September to help with the costs of the refugee response. Later that month, city council included the latter two churches in a plan to divide $750,000 in funds among 22 eligible community organizations.\nRelated News North Toronto churches sheltering refugees feeling strained Refugees moved out of Toronto churches and into hotels across Ontario “Dominion Church received $140,015 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $190,015,” wrote Baker.\n“Pilgrim Feast Tabernacles received $235,305 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $285,305.”\nCity officials realize that is not enough to fund the churches’ efforts, but say City Hall itself isn’t getting enough from Ottawa.\n“In December, the City of Toronto received confirmation that $35 million will be paid to the City by the Federal government, which still leaves $165 million in required funding for the City to manage refugee claimant costs … the City continues to call on its federal partners for all remaining 2023 expenses by year-end.”\nWith the arrival of winter, shelter systems around the GTA are full, and alternative programs are struggling. That leaves refugees like Rasidat, who says she came to Pilgrim Feast from Nigeria to flee persecution for her sexual orientation, worrying about the future.\n“We’re still looking for shelter,” she told Global News, pointing toward her children.\nStory continues below advertisement “If they don’t [increase funding] I will be outside. Something, I don’t know, might happen to my kids due to the cold outside.” Officials at both Pilgrim Feast and Dominion Church have discussed plans to raise funds for, buy and re-zone property to open up their own shelters for asylum claimants. Pilgrim Feast is hoping to open a space in Toronto, while Dominion is eyeing a spot in Peterborough. Those plans, however, are still in their early stages.\nRelated News More Toronto churches turning away asylum seekers they’ve been caring for since summer Toronto church Revivaltime Tabernacle says it will no longer shelter asylum claimants",

Demarai Gray, Moussa Dembele , and former Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum are also in Al-Ettifaq's squad. Gray managed to break the deadlock in the 70th minute, seemingly putting an end to Gerrard's nine-game winless streak, which had lingered for about two months.
