    "text": "By Jack Aylmer ,\n2 hours ago\nEmployees at a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado, made a rare find after an orange lobster was accidentally delivered to the restaurant. The restaurant's manager and customers noticed how much the lobster stuck out among the other darker colored crustaceans in the restaurant's tank and made sure it did not become a customer's meal.\nThe restaurant ultimately called Denver's Downtown Aquarium , and aquarium staff transported the lobster to Denver on Wednesday, July 17. Aquarium officials said that they named the lobster \"Crush\" in honor of the Denver Broncos' famous \"Orange Crush\" defense that dominated in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe food vendor who delivered Crush to the Pueblo Red Lobster said that the lobster was captured off of the coast of Canada.\nAquarium officials said that Crush's color comes from \"a genetic mutation, which affects encoded proteins. The lack of one or several proteins can reveal itself in colors, including blue, yellow and orange.\"\nThe genetic mutation is extremely rare, occurring in just one in every 30 million lobsters, according to the Downtown Aquarium .\nHowever, this is not the first time an orange lobster nearly ended up on someone's seafood platter. In 2018, a Massachusetts grocery store discovered it had an orange lobster in its tank. The store also sent that lobster to a local aquarium.\nThe post 1-in-30-million orange lobster found at Red Lobster in Colorado appeared first on Straight Arrow News .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

We’ll cover the quality and variety of casino gambling games, bonus cash and terms, mobile optimization, and more. 1. [Slots.lv](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/slotslv-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Best Arkansas Online Casino Overall Pros: - $3,000 welcome bonus with 30 free spins - In business for 10+ years - Slots with above-average RTPs - Over 3 dozen live dealer games - Near-instant cryptocurrency withdrawals Cons: - Certain limitations on live table games - Average website aesthetic Over the past 10 years, Slots.lv has become a favorite among Arkansas players. Its RTP rates frequently exceed 96%, and all new players are greeted with $3,000 in bonus cash and 30 free spins. Casino Games & Payout Rates: 4.9/5 Despite the somewhat restricted selection of live table games, Slots.lv offsets this with a collection of over 200 popular slot games, Slots.lv catalog is comparable to Ignition. Its games are sourced from premier software devs, most notably ReelTimeGaming, Rival Gaming, Qora, Betsoft, Genesis, and Spinomenal. This online casino site offers an exemplary list of high RTP slot machines, with some of the most popular being Golden Buffalo, Reels of Fortune, Temple of Athena, and A Night With Cleo. Bonuses and Free Spins: 4.85/5 Slots.lv warmly welcomes new players with [a starter bonus of up to $3,000](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/slotslv-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) on the first deposit if they opt for crypto, also including 30 free spins for the popular casino game Golden Buffalo.

The platform supports both credit cards and cryptocurrency for deposits and withdrawals. Deposits made using a credit card are immediately visible in your account, whereas withdrawals might take up to 48 hours. The site ensures a hassle-free and efficient transaction process, irrespective of the method you choose. 2. [Ignition](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/ignition-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Best Jackpot Slot Machines of All AR Online Casinos Pros: - Above-average RTP rates - $3,000 welcome bonus with just 25x wagering - Poker tourneys with over $10m GTD - Includes a built-in forum - Also offers virtual online sports betting markets Cons: - No card withdrawal options - Could expand the selection of online slots Ignition holds the top position for fans of slot games at online casinos in Arkansas. It offers a vast range of premium virtual machines and a lucrative welcome bonus of up to $3,000 with reasonable playthrough requirements. Casino Games & Payout Rates: 4.8/5 Ignition’s catalog includes over 300 games. It’s a mix of progressive jackpot games, hot drop jackpots, Bonus Buy slots, Megaways, and Double Chance games. Ignition offers a variety of high RTP games, like Gemhalla (97.17% RTP), Cat Kingdom (96.05% RTP), and Fury of Zeus (96% RTP). Poker aficionados will undoubtedly be excited about the opportunity to take part in Ignition’s poker tournaments, which cumulatively offer over $10 million in monthly prizes. Bonuses and Free Spins: 4.75/5 With a low minimum deposit of $20 and a 25x wagering requirement, newcomers to Ignition Casino are greeted with a generous welcome package. This includes [a 300% bonus up to $3,000,](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/ignition-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) split evenly between poker and slot games. If you opt for fiat deposits, the welcome deal is a 200% match worth up to $2,000. Ignition Casino’s loyal players can also receive exclusive benefits as part of its Ignition Miles rewards program. Banking Experience: 4.85/5 Ignition Casino provides various deposit options, encompassing major bank cards and MatchPay. Additionally, the casino is open to an array of cryptocurrencies for both deposit and withdrawal processes, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), and Ethereum. Despite this, it’s important to note that Ignition Casino mandates fiat currency withdrawals to be executed through either a bank transfer or a courier check, with no possibility of credit card withdrawals. 3. [Lucky Red Casino](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/luckyred-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Best Online Casino in Arkansas for Mobile Pros: - Perfect mobile experience on all devices - $4,000 welcome deal at 400% rate - 400+ mobile casino games - $75 extra chip for crypto players - $1.4m jackpots on some slots Cons: - Payout limits don’t suit low-stake players - Lackluster table games and live dealers Lucky Red is our No. 1 recommendation for mobile casino players in Arkansas. The gaming experience on all iOS and Android devices is perfect, and you can score up to $4,000 in bonus cash on your first deposit. Casino Games & Payout Rates: 4.7/5 Mobile gaming aficionados will find Lucky Red Casino a goldmine, with its impressive selection of 400 premium slot games, various table game alternatives, and an exclusive assortment of specialty titles, all optimized for instant play on mobile devices. High-stakes players will find the game Aztec’s Millions irresistible, as it regularly features jackpot pools that exceed $1,000,000. While the slot game portfolio at Lucky Red provides all the thrills you need, there is potential for improvement in their range of table games and live dealer offerings. Bonuses and Free Spins: 4.6/5 An enticing [400% match bonus ](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/luckyred-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp)awaits new players at Lucky Red, scaling up to $4,000. Remember to apply the LUCKYRED400 code while making your cryptocurrency deposit to secure your $75 casino chip. Once you’ve fully utilized your welcome bonus, a host of daily promotions are lined up for you, covering reload deals and extra spins. Banking Experience: 4.7/5 Whether you like transacting with Visa and MasterCard or prefer digital currencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin, Lucky Red Casino has got you covered. A minimum deposit of $35 applies to standard currencies, while it’s set at $20 for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin users are subject to a minimum withdrawal limit of $50 per transaction, which is not ideal for lower-stake players. But it’s still better than the $200 minimum payout for bank transfers or courier checks. We believe these thresholds could be slightly lower across the board. 4. [Highway Casino](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/highway-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Biggest AR Online Casino Welcome Bonus Pros: - $7,000 in welcome bonuses - 300% reload bonus - About a dozen regular deals - Top-notch VIP program - Neosurf banking is available Cons: - Could use lower minimum deposits - Slower loading time Nothing excites a casino player like a welcome bonus, and it’s pretty tricky to beat the $7,000 welcome bonus offer available at Highway Casino! Casino Games & Payout Rates: 4.65/5 The jackpots provided by Highway Casino are pretty impressive, although their slot games might not match up to the likes of Ignition of Slots.lv. Take, for instance, the famous jackpot slot from Nucleus Gaming, Sherlock and The Mystic Compass. Its popularity is largely due to the Bonus Round, which requires no less than five scatter symbols to trigger. The gaming collection primarily comes from RealTime Gaming (RTG), one of the most prominent software providers in the industry. Bonuses and Free Spins: 4.9/5 With a generous [$7,000 welcome package](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/highway-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) and a range of distinctive promotions tailored for online slot games, Highway Casino warmly welcomes all newcomers. We are particularly fond of several offers, including an exclusive bonus of $2,850 on the initial cryptocurrency deposit, a substantial 300% increase on reload deposit matches, and special advantages for those who play with high stakes. Banking Experience: 4.55/5 Highway Casino players have the flexibility to use both traditional money and a variety of cryptocurrencies. The platform allows immediate deposits through credit and debit cards, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even the not-so-common Neosurf – a unique feature among many online casino sites. When it comes to withdrawals, options include bank cards, Bitcoin, or wire transfers. The casino sets a base payout limit of $100, which escalates to $300 when using bank transfers. 5. [Super Slots](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/superslots-main-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Best Arkansas Online Casino for Live Games Pros: - 70+ live table games - $6,000 sign-up package - $500k BTC deposits, 20+ crypto methods - Near-instant payouts - Dedicated $4k crypto bonus Cons: - Mobile experience could be improved - Lackluster live poker options Super Slots is the leading choice for fans of live table games and crypto users.

Junto a él, se construye el Extremely Large Telescope, con aún mayor capacidad.\n\"Las emisiones de polvo durante la construcción, el aumento de la turbulencia atmosférica y, especialmente la contaminación lumínica, tendrán un impacto irreparable en las capacidades de observación astronómica\", advirtió el director general de ESO, Xavier Barcons, en un comunicado.\nParanal fue inaugurado en 1999 y se ubica en pleno desierto de Atacama, el más árido del mundo, un lugar ideal para la observación astronómica por su clima seco, altitud y ausencia de nubes y lluvia.\nEl complejo es parte de la red de observatorios astronómicos con los que cuenta Chile, entre ellos el radiotelescopio Alma y el telescopio óptico de La Silla, también en el norte de Chile.\nA fines de diciembre, la compañía AES Andes informó que el proyecto incluye \"la producción de hidrógeno y amoniaco verde, así como el desarrollo de energía solar, eólica y de almacenamiento en baterías\", en línea con el objetivo de Chile de ampliar el origen renovable de su matriz energética.\nAES Andes no emitió comentarios ante una petición de la AFP.\nPara Itziar de Gregorio, representante de ESO en Chile, \"es crucial considerar ubicaciones alternativas para este megaproyecto que no pongan en peligro uno de los tesoros astronómicos más importantes del mundo\".\nEn octubre de 2024, comenzó a regir en Chile una nueva norma lumínica para resguardar lugares cercanos a los observatorios, pero también la salud de personas y animales.\nLa normativa establece límites de luminosidad, horarios máximos de funcionamiento de pantallas publicitarias, además de promover la transición hacia el uso de luz cálida, menos contaminante.\n[Síguenos en](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEOgjh55R1O_OHSPw0T00iXYqFAgKIhDoI4eeUdTvzh0j8NE9NIl2)",

    "text": "BLUEFIELD, W. Va. ( WVVA /Gray News) - The lives of stray cats don’t always have happy endings, but the survival of one lucky cat in West Virginia is helping to show how love and affection can beat even unlikely odds. Second Chance for Cats is not a stranger to rescuing strays. The shelter houses many felines waiting for their forever homes. It recently took in an injured stray named Sapphire and found out that what first appeared to be a broken leg was actually a broken neck. Elizabeth MacDonald, the co-founder and treasurer of Second Chance for Cats, said it was the first time the shelter had seen that sort of injury. “We’ve had some broken legs before, we’ve had broken tails, but we have never had anything that’s been this severe,” she said. Sapphire had fractured his C7 vertebra, leaving him almost unable to move. He had to be hand-fed, couldn’t use the litter box, and had to be moved often to prevent bedsores. Second Chance for Cats reached out to veterinarians for help but were told that Sapphire’s survival was unlikely. Dr. Mark French, a veterinarian with Ridge Animal Hospital , said he told MacDonald that the chance of Sapphire regaining his functionality was “almost zero.” “I think I used the term ‘might be miraculous’ if it could ever walk again,” he said. French said it was unusual for surgery attempts to be made on animals with broken necks. Sapphire was also just four months old, meaning his soft and small bones would require extra care. Despite the setback, MacDonald believed it was not the size of the cat in the fight but the size of the fight in the cat and did what she could to help Sapphire recover. “From the very first day that we got this cat, there was just something in that cat’s eyes. And it was like he wanted to survive,” she said. She spoke with her co-worker, and the two agreed that they would do everything in their power to help Sapphire survive. “And that’s what we did,” McDonald said. French was able to install a plate on Sapphire’s small spine through incisions in the top and bottom of his neck. If the surgery was successful, French estimated the cat would be able to walk within four months. However, under the watchful eye of his surgeon and rescuers, Sapphire was wobbly walking in three weeks. “Elizabeth and her group, I think that they have put in a whole lot of work and they certainly are, what do they call themselves, Second Chance? Well, by golly, that’s what they’re into, giving cats a second chance,” French said. French said Sapphire changed his outlook on what is possible. MacDonald said she hopes the cat’s success story will inspire others going through difficult times to keep their head up and keep fighting. MacDonald also wanted to give credit to the people who donated the $5,000 to make the surgery possible. She said Sapphire will stay at Second Chance for Cats while he heals, but plans to have him up for adoption when he is ready. Copyright 2024 WVVA via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Summary\nOn April 23, 2025, Insmed Inc (INSM, Financial), a global biopharmaceutical company, announced the publication of positive results from its pivotal phase 3 ASPEN study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study evaluated brensocatib, an investigational therapy for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and lung function decline. Brensocatib is currently under priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a target action date set for August 12, 2025.\nPositive Aspects\n- Brensocatib showed a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations compared to placebo.\n- The study demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of lung function decline with brensocatib 25 mg.\n- Brensocatib was well-tolerated, with manageable treatment-emergent adverse events.\n- The ASPEN study is the largest clinical trial ever conducted in bronchiectasis, highlighting its robust data set.\nNegative Aspects\n- Brensocatib is still under investigation and has not yet received regulatory approval.\n- Potential adverse events, such as COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, cough, and headache, were noted in the study.\nFinancial Analyst Perspective\nFrom a financial standpoint, the positive results from the ASPEN study could significantly enhance Insmed Inc's market position, especially if brensocatib receives FDA approval. The potential approval could open up a new revenue stream in the bronchiectasis market, which currently lacks approved therapies. However, investors should remain cautious of the risks associated with regulatory approval processes and market acceptance.\nMarket Research Analyst Perspective\nThe ASPEN study's results position brensocatib as a potential first-in-class therapy for bronchiectasis, addressing a significant unmet medical need. With approximately 1.25 million patients diagnosed in the U.S., EU5, and Japan, the market potential is substantial. The successful commercialization of brensocatib could transform the treatment landscape for bronchiectasis and potentially expand into other neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: What is the significance of the ASPEN study?\nA: The ASPEN study is the largest clinical trial conducted in bronchiectasis, demonstrating significant reductions in pulmonary exacerbations and lung function decline with brensocatib.\nQ: What is the current status of brensocatib?\nA: Brensocatib is under priority review by the U.S. FDA, with a target action date of August 12, 2025.\nQ: What are the potential side effects of brensocatib?\nA: Common treatment-emergent adverse events include COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, cough, and headache.\nQ: How does brensocatib work?\nA: Brensocatib is a dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitor that targets neutrophil-mediated inflammation, potentially reducing lung damage and inflammation.\n Read the original press release here.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

    "title": "Solon resident explains why he posted petition against Chagrin Valley Islamic Center - cleveland.com",
    "text": "Mark Liner, a Solon resident who is serving as a member of the Israel Defense Forces, says the amount of anti-Israel rhetoric that has been spread since Oct. 7, 2023 -- when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel -- is “terrifying.” In an online interview Wednesday (Oct. 23), Liner said that was one of the reasons why he and a group of other residents posted a petition in late September on change.org against the Solon-based Chagrin Valley Islamic Center (CVIC). The petition, signed by “We the People of Solon,” demands that city leaders “condemn the antisemitism being openly harbored and promoted” by the CVIC and to have the CVIC cease operations in the city. Liner said the CVIC -- which opened the city’s first mosque on Liberty Road in 2021 -- has been promoting antisemitism “under the guise of anti-Zionism” for more than three years, despite vocal concerns from the community. “I made this petition along with over a dozen Solon residents who are also concerned about the recent rise in antisemitism,” said Liner, a 2019 Solon High School graduate who requested that his city of residence in Israel not be disclosed. “Our only goal is to call out antisemitism and make sure that our city leaders follow through with upholding the city’s DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies and antisemitism resolution (passed in April 2023).” Liner said the petition was signed by “a few Muslim people, who acknowledge that the hate against Israel being promoted by the (CVIC) has nothing to do with the Quran and goes against true Islam.” Liner claimed that after Oct. 7, 2023, the CVIC and its leaders started to heavily promote antisemitism and radicalism. “It’s a fact that this became a regular pattern with the CVIC, despite reaching out to both city leaders and the mosque itself, that I and other Solon residents felt the need to make the petition,” he said. CVIC officials deny these claims and said that their mosque has promoted peace throughout the conflict between Hamas and Israel. At the City Council meeting Monday (Oct. 21), 19 people -- including many religious leaders -- spoke to council in support of the CVIC. After nearly 200 people signed the petition, it was removed from change.org after being “mass reported,” Liner said. “The website claimed it was removed due to ‘false or misleading information,’ despite not stating what information specifically they considered to be false or misleading,” he said. Liner was also a co-organizer of a pro-Israel rally Sept. 8 in Solon. More than 100 people rallied that day at the city’s Veterans Memorial Park gazebo to commemorate the 11-month mark since Hamas launched its attack on Israel. More than 1,200 people were killed by Hamas in the attack, which triggered the Israel-Hamas War that is still taking place. “It’s important to note that this petition has absolutely nothing to do with Islam or the fact that (CVIC is) a mosque, as they may claim that any of their critics are ‘Islamophobic’ as a way of deflecting attention away from their antisemitism,” the petition stated. “We the People of Solon stand with the Global Imams Council and their statement that was released on Sept. 1, 2024, blaming Hamas for all deaths and destruction on both sides since Oct. 7, (2023), naming Hamas as the aggressor in the war, and calling for the immediate release of all hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas. “We wish that the Chagrin Valley Islamic Center would follow the wisdom of the Global Imams Council and stop promoting and partnering with organizations and ideologies that front as being Islamic community organizations, but in reality act as an arm for Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the West.” The petition also stated that the CVIC has partnered with and is in support of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. Liner claimed that CAIR “promotes its members to attend anti-Israel rallies and take part in antisemitic activities.” “The Biden administration cut ties with CAIR last December after its national executive director, Nihad Awad, stated at a CAIR conference that Oct. 7 attacks made him ‘happy,’” Liner said. Allegations date to 2021 Liner noted that he runs a group on Facebook called the Solon Community Group. In 2021, he said it was brought to his attention that the CVIC was promoting antisemitism with the invitation of a “notorious antisemite” named Yasir Qadhi as the featured speaker for one of its first fundraisers. “Qadhi is listed by the Canary Mission as having a long history of promoting antisemitism and hate against Christians, hate against Israel and supporting terrorists,” Liner said. “After speaking with a few other residents, I sent Solon Mayor Ed Kraus an email of concern regarding the mosque promoting this speaker. “He replied, thanking me for bringing this to his attention, and later spoke with the CVIC’s leaders to have them cancel Qadhi from their event.” Less than a month later, Liner claimed, CVIC leaders Simee and Masroor Malik started sharing “anti-Israel ideologies” on their joint Facebook account, including promoting a “Free Palestine” protest in downtown Cleveland. “I continued to bring these issues up with Mayor Kraus because the concern was that this new religious institution was suddenly promoting radicalism and hate against Israel,” Liner said. “Also, Masroor Malik, the leader of the mosque, is an unelected member of the Solon Community Relations Committee through City Hall and is listed on the city’s website (as such).” Masroor Malik is the CVIC’s director of finance and a member of its executive board. A more recent example of the CVIC’s promotion of radicalism and antisemitism, Liner said, is its promotion of an event set for Saturday (Oct. 26) at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland featuring former CNN anchor Marc Lamont Hill, who was fired from his position at CNN in 2018 after his antisemitic and pro-terrorist comments surfaced. “Keep in mind Marc Lamont Hill has nothing to do with Islam or the teachings of the Quran; rather his only involvement in Middle East issues is with his open support of jihadism and hatred of Israel,” Liner said. “It’s very concerning to people that the CVIC is promoting him.” Liner said since posting the petition, he has been “harassed and targeted” by CAIR, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and “a few radical faith leaders in the area because I’m a lone soldier in the IDF.” A “lone soldier” is a soldier in the IDF with no family in Israel to support him or her. “They’re using the fact that I’m an IDF soldier as a way to stir hate about this petition, combined with the lie that it was ‘Islamophobic,’” Liner said. ”It’s a completely irrelevant detail to the petition, and not only that, but the petition was made along with over a dozen Solon residents who are Jews, Christians and Hindus.” When asked for his reaction to the comments made by speakers in support of the CVIC at Monday’s council meeting, Liner said, “Most of the people who spoke gave nothing but the same repetitive emotional arguments over and over again about how the CVIC donates to food drives and has samosa dinner parties at their mosque. “But in my opinion and the opinion of many other Solon residents, none of that justifies the mosque promoting radicalism and antisemitism,” he said.
