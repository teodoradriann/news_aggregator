    "text": "CoMs raises salaries for those working under intense shelling The relevant decision was made at a government meeting on December 29, Ukrinform reports, citing [the Ministry of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories](https://minre.gov.ua/2023/12/29/uryad-pidvyshhyv-zarplaty-osobam-yaki-praczyuyut-v-umovah-intensyvnyh-obstriliv/). \"Today, the Cabinet of Ministers has amended resolutions No. 391 of 25.04.2023 and No. 928 of 25.08.2023. These changes are aimed at increasing the salaries of those who work under intense shelling in the territory of active hostilities. This also applies to civil servants,\" the statement said. In particular, employees will have the opportunity to double the amount of the allowance for work during intense [shelling](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-obstril) in the areas where active hostilities are taking place, per month in proportion to the working days when the shelling took place. The list of work for which such an allowance is paid will be determined by the head of the regional military administration. [Zelensky thanks power engineers for their tirelessness and efficiency](/rubric-society/3803451-zelensky-thanks-power-engineers-for-their-tirelessness-and-efficiency.html) For civil servants working in special conditions in the areas of active hostilities during intense shelling, it is envisaged to determine the salaries with a coefficient of 3 per month in proportion to the working days when the shelling took place. The list of employees will be agreed with the relevant regional military administration. The draft resolution was developed by the Ministry of Reintegration on the instructions of the Prime Minister together with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy. As reported, in the third quarter of 2023, the average monthly salary in Ukraine increased by 22.7% compared to the same period last year and [amounted to UAH 17,937](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3803239-seredna-zarplata-v-ukraini-perevisila-17-900-griven.html).

    "title": "Over 30,000 Boeing workers are preparing to strike after rejecting a new labor contract",
    "text": "Over 30,000 Boeing workers, or about 20% of the company’s employees, are preparing to strike on Friday after rejecting a new labor contract.\nWorkers in Washington and Oregon voted against an agreement that Boeing and the labor union for machinists and aerospace workers proposed on Sunday. The vote was the first full contract vote in 16 years. It did not come out in Boeing’s favor: almost 95% voted to reject the contract and 96% voted in favor of striking.\nUnder rules set by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the labor union for Boeing employees, at least two-thirds of unionized workers have to vote in favor for a strike to begin or a contract to be rejected.\n“IAM members from across North America stand in solidarity with our members in the Pacific Northwest and California,” the union said in a statement released Thursday. “Our goal is to get a strong contract that meets the needs of our members.”\nOn Thursday, dozens of employees marched to a union hall near Boeing’s 737 Max plant in Renton, Washington, blowing whistles, banging drums, and holding up signs calling for a strike.\nThe strike would pause most of the American aircraft maker’s production, a headache for the company grappling with safety and reputation concerns after taking several hits this year. It is also a big blow to its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who stepped into the role about six weeks ago.\nA day before the vote, Ortberg urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company’s recovery .\nAccording to an estimate from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The last strike, in 2008, shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day, Reuters reported .\nThe rejected contract would have increased workers’ general wages by 25% over the length of the four-year contract. Boeing would also build its next commercial plane in the Seattle area, as long as the program is initiated within four years of the contract. The tentative labor contract, which included a pay increase over four years, was touted as another win for the beleaguered company.\nThe proposal left workers unsatisfied, Jon Holden, president of the IAM’s district 751 and lead negotiator on the Boeing contract, told Reuters on Monday.\n“They’re angry,” Holden told Reuters. “It’s hard to come off of 10 years when you lost so many things that were critical.”\nSome union members had been pushing for a much higher wage hike— up to 40% — and the return of the company’s pension plan, which it discontinued a decade ago, Holden said.\nBoeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe post Over 30,000 Boeing workers are preparing to strike after rejecting a new labor contract appeared first on Business Insider .",

    "title": "Two Guangdong Women in Detention for Their Faith in Falun Gong, Both Previously Jailed for 3 Years | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Two residents of Maoming City, Guangdong Province remained detained since their arrests weeks ago for their faith in Falun Gong, a mind-body practice that has been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party since July 1999. Ms. Wang Ying, around 64, accompanied Ms. Tao Yonghong, 63, to visit the latter’s mother, 90-year-old Ms. Ding Jiaxi, on December 13, 2023. As soon as they arrived, more than ten officers from the Guandu Police Station barged in and raided Ms. Ding’s home, before proceeding to search Ms. Tao’s and Ms. Wang’s homes. The police had been staked outside the home of Ms. Ding, also a Falun Gong practitioner, and knew that her daughter Ms. Tao visited her often. Both Ms. Wang and Ms. Tao were taken to the Guandu Police Station before being transferred to the Maoming City Detention Center, where they remain. This is not the first time that Ms. Wang and Ms. Tao have been targeted for their faith. Ms. Wang was a jade expert and an engineer at Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. She served two years of forced labor and three years in prison for practicing Falun Gong. Her employer fired her in May 2011 after she was released from prison. They also reduced her years of service to zero from her pension calculation formula, resulting in her complete loss of retirement benefits. Ms. Tao is a retiree of Sinopec Maoming Petrochemical Company. She served three years in prison for her faith (2011-2014) and was briefly detained on several occasions. Around June 2022, the local social security office ordered Ms. Tao to pay back more than 102,000 yuan in pension benefits (including about 50,000 yuan of payments issued during her three-year prison term and more than 52,000 yuan in annual benefit increase she received since her prison release). They threatened to suspend her future pension if she did not comply. It is unclear whether she paid the money as ordered. Additionally, when Ms. Tao was not in detention, she and her mother faced constant harassment from the authorities. Past Persecution of Ms. Wang: 2 Years of Forced Labor, 3 Years of Prison Sentence, Wrongful Termination, and Loss of Pension In August 1988, Ms. Wang contracted kidney disease, which eventually developed into uremia at the end of 1994. Just when her life seemed hopeless, she encountered Falun Gong the following year. In just one month, her uremia symptoms disappeared. She also became an even more conscientious worker and an authoritative jade appraiser. At work, the laser Raman spectroscopy analysis tests she was responsible for always turned out accurate results, and she won the title of advanced worker at the Guangzhou Regional Scientific Instrument Collaboration Network several years in a row. After the persecution of Falun Gong began in 1999, Ms. Wang became a target. She was given two years of forced labor at the Guangzhou City Women’s Labor Camp in July 2000. Officers from the Tianhe District Police Department arrested Ms. Wang in April 2008 and took her to the Tianhe District Detention Center, where the guards kept her handcuffed and shackled for long stretches of time. The Tianhe District Court later sentenced her to three years and she served time at the Guangdong Province Women’s Prison. On May 6, 2011, not long after Ms. Wang was released from prison, her employer fired her and reduced her years of service to zero, which rendered her with no pension when she reached retirement age three years later. On July 22, 2017, Ms. Wang called the inspection team of the central government’s Commission for Discipline Inspection to complain about her wrongful termination and loss of pension, only to be harassed by Wu Min of the local street committee. She had to leave Guangzhou (capital of Guangdong Province) and move in with her grown children in Maoming City. To this day, Ms. Wang has not received a penny of her pension benefits. Past Persecution of Ms. Tao: Jailed for 3 Years and Multiple Short-term Detentions Ms. Tao used to suffer from numerous diseases, including stomach problems, migraines, cervical hyperplasia, rhinitis, gum bleeding, breast hyperplasia, heart disease, rheumatism, lower back pain, hemorrhoids, thrombocytopenia, low blood pressure, and frequent colds. She was thin, frail and had a spotted, dark complexion. In early 1998, one of her relatives urged Ms. Tao to give Falun Gong a try. She agreed and soon recovered from her symptoms. She has never needed to take any medication since. Jailed for 3 Years and Brutally Tortured Ms. Tao was arrested on June 9, 2011 after being reported for distributing Falun Gong informational materials. The arresting officers from the Zhensheng Police Station put her on criminal detention at the Maoming City First Detention Center the next day and she was issued a formal arrest warrant on July 14 that year. The Maonan District [Procuratorate] indicted Ms. Tao on September 29, 2011 and the Maonan District Court sentenced her to three years on November 10, 2011. Presiding judge Dai Wen, judges Li Weiming and Wu Yuemei, as well as clerk Wu Xiaoting were present during her trial. Ms. Tao’s appeal was denied by the Maoming City Intermediate Court on January 16, 2012 and she was transferred to the Guangdong Province Women’s Prison on February 10, 2012. During her eight months of detention at the Maoming City First Detention Center, Ms. Tao was brutalized for refusing to do hard labor without pay. Deputy director Zhong directed three inmates to beat her in a corner without surveillance cameras. She sustained severe internal injuries to her ribs and afterwards had trouble lying in bed due to the pain. The inmates also dunked her head into a bucket full of water and splashed water into her ears. Before her internal injuries healed, Zhong ordered Ms. Tao to be shackled for 14 days. She lost about a third of her weight in no time. About two months later, her left ear became infected and oozed pus, causing hearing difficulties. Her weight continued to drop. An inmate commented that she looked like a skeleton. The torture of Ms. Tao continued after she was admitted to the Guangdong Province Women’s Prison. On more than one occasion, she was deprived of sleep for 24 hours straight. She once became so fatigued that she passed out and struck her head against a wall. Only then did the guards allow her to sleep for the next two nights. Even so, the inmates assigned to watch her still beat her to wake her up from time to time during her sleep. During the day, she was forced to watch anti-Falun Gong videos and clean her cell. After lunch, she was forced to wash the dishes used by more than 700 inmates. At night she was forced to either stand or sit on a small bench in a corner without surveillance cameras. Six guards and five big and tall inmates took turns watching her at night. The inmates actively abused her in order to get term reductions. They bragged that they had all kinds of tricks up their sleeves to “deal with her” if she refused to renounce Falun Gong. One inmate stomped on Ms. Tao’s feet every few minutes. She also twisted her feet to make Ms. Tao suffer even more. Inmate Li Yanli pinched Ms. Tao’s thighs once every few minutes, leaving deep bruises. When Ms. Tao had to defecate, inmate Li Qiong squatted down to see whether her stool came out. Inmate Lai Bingmei slapped Ms. Tao in the face but claimed she was being hit first. Guard Min saw what happened from the surveillance camera but he came over to reprimand Ms. Tao, “You dared to beat Lai? I doubt you’d still have the audacity to do so if I had my electric baton with me.” Min also forced Ms. Tao to do military training as punishment. He and several inmates would follow her and flog her fingers with thin whips. Her hands turned red and swollen from the beatings. Ms. Tao was not ill, but the guards instructed several inmates to pin her on the ground and pry open her mouth to force-feed her unknown drugs. Ms. Tao was only given two minutes to take a shower each time. She had barely taken off her clothes when the roll call bell rang. Guard Min threatened to drag her out naked when he noted she had not come out of the shower yet. For a period of time, the guards gave Ms. Tao very little food and no water to drink. They also did not allow her to shower or use the restroom. From June to September each year, Ms. Tao was held in a small room without air conditioning or electric fans. Because she was denied restroom use, she had to relieve herself in her pants. The guards did not allow her to change clothes. She was not allowed to go to bed until 3 a.m. She was so tired that she hit the pillow with her soiled pants. The guards still did not allow her to change clothes the next morning unless she said, “I am a criminal and I now request to change my pants.” In order to force Ms. Tao to renounce Falun Gong, the guards resorted to various tactics to try to break her physically and mentally. The long-term torture caused her feet to swell terribly. Her left ear rang all the time. Her entire body was in pain. She had diarrhea once every two days. 15 Days of Criminal Detention in 2015 At around 10 a.m. one day in May 2015, more than two dozens officers, led by Zhou Wen from the Maonan District Domestic Security Office, broke into Ms. Tao’s mother’s – Ms. Ding’s – home. About ten more officers joined the first group during the raid, including the chief of the Maonan District Police Department. They confiscated a newly purchased laptop worth more than 2,000 yuan, several hundred yuan in cash, scissors, an iron, hair dryer and other valuables. The police suspected Ms. Tao of distributing Falun Gong materials and they raided her mother’s home because they knew she often stayed there for days at a time. They gave her 15 days of criminal detention at the Maoming City First Detention Center. Held in Custody for 23 Hours in 2016 Six people, including director Xu Yue’e and deputy directors Liang Yamei and Xu Yaqiu from the Shita Neighborhood Committee, as well as director Deng Huizhen and deputy directors Wu Fuquan and Zhou Hong from the Qiaobei Neighborhood Committee, showed up at Ms. Tao’s mother’s, Ms. Ding’s, home at 4:30 p.m. on September 12, 2016. They claimed they were there to see if Ms. Ding had renewed her senior citizens’ certificate (which comes with benefits for seniors, such as free bus rides). One of them took out her phone to take pictures. Ms. Tao, who was with her mother, stopped the woman. They then left. Three hours later, Ms. Tao needed to run some errands. When she stepped out of her mother’s apartment building, she saw around twenty people from the two neighborhood committees outside. Four of them swarmed her and asked her some random questions to stop her from leaving. About twenty minutes later, two officers (with badge numbers 224656 and 050080) from the Guandu Police Station arrived. Then a woman from the Guandu Street Office came over and asked Ms. Tao to go to the police station to answer some questions. She promised her that the police would let her go home as soon as everything was done. Ms. Tao believed the woman and got into the police cruiser. No one ever asked her questions and she was held at the police station for 23 hours, during which time director Feng and others from the neighborhood committees watched her. Neither they nor the police ever provided any legal basis for keeping her there. 15 Days of Administrative Detention in 2019 One day in October 2019, Ms. Tao went to the Maoming Railway Station and lost her wallet. A railway worker found the wallet and saw a few Falun Gong [amulet]s in it. When he saw Ms. Tao looking for her wallet, he seized her and took her to the Railway Police Station. At 2:30 that afternoon, her mother’s house was raided by Li Jie of the Maonan District Domestic Security Office, deputy chief Pan of the Railway Police Station, more than a dozen officers from the Guandu Police Station, and staffers from the Shita Neighborhood Committee. They seized some cash and valuables. Ms. Tao was given 15 days of administrative detention at the Maoming City Second Detention Center. Another 15 Days of Administrative Detention in 2020 Ms. Tao was arrested at 3 p.m. on August 24, 2020 and given 15 days of administrative detention at the Maoming City Second Detention. The Maonan District Police Department, the Guandu Police Station, and the Gaotie Police Station were responsible for her arrest. Endless Harassment of Ms. Tao and Her Mother Ms. Ding lives alone, so her youngest child, Ms. Tao, visited her often and sometimes stayed with her for days. They both faced endless harassment from the authorities. Below are harassment episodes from recent years that did not result in Ms. Tao’s arrest. Numerous Harassment Episodes in October 2017 Before the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, from October 16 to 23, 2017, the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to harass Ms. Tao at least once a day, sometimes twice a day. She was living with her mother during that period. The harassers took pictures of her with their phones. Once, Ms. Tao and her mother were having lunch, when two people from the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to harass them. Another time at 10:30 p.m., two men in plainclothes came. One was waiting on the third floor, and the other knocked on the door. Ms. Ding had already gone to sleep and she was awoken by the loud pounding on the door. They said they were from the Guandu Police Station, and they’d come to check on her. There were at least 12 other episodes of harassment in October 2017. They also called Ms. Tao’s husband when they could not find her at her mother’s house. One Harassment Episode Each in 2018 and 2019 Deputy directors Xu Yaqiu and Liang Yamei from the Shita Neighborhood Committee, led two staffers to harass Ms. Ding at home at 3:30 p.m. on June 11, 2018. They claimed to be doing a welfare check. Ms. Tao told them that her mother had been healthy for twenty years thanks to Falun Gong. They left. Xu and Liang knocked on Ms. Ding’s door at 3:15 p.m. on January 15, 2019. They brought in a document and ordered her and Ms. Tao to sign. Both refused to comply. Harassment in the Name of Welfare Check and Census in 2020 Deputy director Liang from the Shita Neighborhood Committee and a man who was the director of the local Stability Maintenance Office came to Ms. Ding’s home at 10:30 a.m. on May 29, 2020, when Ms. Ding and Ms. Tao were having a late breakfast. Liang said they were there to visit the elderly Ms. Ding and the man said they came to see whether Ms. Ding had renewed her senior citizens’ certificate. Ms. Tao said that her mother could go to their office to do the renewal and that they did not need them to bother them at home. They then left. At 9 p.m. on August 24, 2020, deputy directors Liang and Xu of the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to Ms. Ding’s house to “conduct a census.” After checking her household registration book, they asked if she still practiced Falun Gong. They then asked the names of her oldest daughter and her son-in-law. Ms. Ding refused to answer, as that was not part of the census. They left. Neighbors Condemn Harassment of Ms. Ding in 2021 On March 2, 2021, deputy director Xu of the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to Ms. Ding’s apartment building and asked her neighbors about her. Three days later, Xu came to harass Ms. Ding, using the excuse of checking the status of the renewal of her senior citizen’s certificate. Ms. Ding learned from two of her neighbors that Xu had actually talked to them outside the apartment building before going up to her home. Xu asked the two neighbors if they had seen her shopping for groceries and whether her daughter Ms. Tao had visited her. The neighbors found Xu’s questions odd and replied that it was normal for a daughter to visit her mother. They condemned her for harassing Ms. Ding. One night at the end of November 2021, two groups of people from the Guandu Street Office, the Shita Neighborhood Committee, and the Qiaobei Neighborhood Committee harassed both Ms. Ding and Ms. Tao at their respective homes using the census as an excuse. About one month later, Ms. Ding and Ms. Tao both noticed people monitoring them outside their homes. There were also two high-resolution cameras installed on the gate of Ms. Ding’s apartment complex. Three Harassment Episodes in 2022 At around 4 p.m. on April 21, 2022, someone saw a police officer and a female neighborhood committee member at the door of Ms. Ding’s home. The woman knocked on the door and left when no one answered. Around 5:00 p.m. on December 16, 2022, a middle-aged man was spotted outside Ms. Ding’s apartment building. He pretended to be looking at his phone. At around 10 a.m. on December 18, 2022, deputy director Liang of the Shita Neighborhood Committee knocked on Ms. Ding’s door with a piece of paper in her hand. Ms. Tao, who was with her mother, opened the door. The man who accompanied Liang said he needed to see Ms. Ding. Ms. Tao demanded to know his identity and he replied he was from the Guandu Street Office, also surnamed Liang. Director Liang wanted to take a picture of Ms. Tao but Ms. Tao stopped her. Liang said that the higher-up sent them there. Ms. Tao took pictures of him. He became nervous and offered to treat her and her mother to tea. Harassment in 2023 Preceding Ms. Tao’s Latest Arrest At around 10 a.m. on February 17, 2023, a tall man knocked on Ms. Ding’s door. He was about fifty years old and wearing glasses. He took a photo of the door and knocked on it for a long time before leaving. Outside the apartment building, a short and yellow-haired woman was seen monitoring the entrance to Ms. Ding’s apartment building. After the tall man came downstairs, he monitored everyone who entered or exited Ms. Ding’s apartment building. There was a camera in the courtyard recording everyone coming out of the apartment building, with another camera facing outside to record anyone entering the building. Opposite the gate of the apartment complex, there was a middle-aged man in light green clothes monitoring the pedestrians in the courtyard. Ms. Tao suspected they were personnel from the Shita Neighborhood Committee and the Guandu Street Office who were monitoring her and her mother. In early February 2023, Ms. Tao’s son received a call from the police, asking where she lived. On February 13, her husband received another call from the police, again asking where she was. Her husband said he did not know and told the police not to bother him. Related Articles in Chinese: Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",
