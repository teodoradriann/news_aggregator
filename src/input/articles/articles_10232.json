    "title": "Previous employee of Circle B out thousands of dollars",
    "text": "By Nikki Hallman ,\n14 days ago\nAfter a devastated future bride shared on her Tik Tok of the surprise closure of Circle B Weddings and Events Venue in Isanti, she realized her and her fiancée would not receive a refund.\nMore couples would come to find the same news about their future weddings when the owners, Wayne and Angela Butt, sent an email explaining the closure on April 21.\nBut someone closer to the venue would also lose out on thousands of dollars: previous employee Kim Sollars.\nSollars didn’t expect the Butts would eventually owe her $28,000 in wages when she met them a year ago.\nShe met the Butts in April 2023 after coming across a Facebook Marketplace ad for banquet chairs they were selling. While making the exchange for the chairs at Circle B, Sollars said Angi asked if she was interested in purchasing the venue as they were selling.\nSollars pondered the idea, so she and her daughter had a dinner with the Butts to discuss Circle B. A few days later she was setting up chairs and working at the venue.\nSollars said Wayne showed her how the couple would go about the business once, and after that they rarely returned to their wedding and event center.\n“They were never there for any of the weddings last year,” she said.\nThe Butts had a ribbon cutting ceremony in April 2023 and a grand opening that May. Meanwhile, Sollars began her job as manager of the venue.\nShe, along with her husband, two sons, daughter and her daughter’s husband, all pitched in, working at Circle B throughout the season.\nSollars said they cleaned the two Airbnbs the Butts owned next door to the venue. They also maintained the yard, cleaned the barn after the wedding, and fixed anything that would break.\nSollars said the couple agreed on paying her $700 per wedding in the barn, $200 per Airbnb every time they were cleaned, $20 per hour per person working the wedding. She did sign a W-2 for the position, but no contract was ever made.\n“They said ‘Just take a tally of everything you have and we’ll take if off the closing costs,’” she said.\nEventually, Sollars realized she was being taken advantage of.\n“I think by August I was like, ‘They haven’t been paying me,’” she said.\nSollars would pay for anything that was needed as the Butts wouldn’t respond properly to her requests about venue needs.\n“I had about $6,000 of my personal property, all over — including one of my commercial freezers,” Sollars said.\nWhen these issues began, she was in the middle of moving around her finances to prepare for purchasing the business, making her feel more connected and dedicated to the venue. As a result, Sollars couldn’t leave, despite the wrong actions that were occurring.\n“I feel like I needed to show up or the brides couldn’t get in,” she said.\nSollars said she told the Butts that they needed to pay her some amount of money to prove she was on their payroll and that’s when the one and only time she received money.\nThey gave her $4,000 worth of cleaning wages. But no hourly pay.\nSollars said while she was in the process of getting the financials together, the businesses profit shown in the projections was too low for her bank to approve any loan.\nThis led Sollars to start booking weddings and events for what she thought would be her future business. She put 17 more weddings on the schedule.\n“I was sustained (financially) until October of this year with utilities mortgage and everything,” she said.\nThe projections finally showed a positive direction, allowing for purchase agreements to be written up toward the end of last summer.\nAccording to Sollars, a purchase price of $2.7 million was agreed upon for the barn and the land behind it, before the season was over.\nSollars worked from the beginning of May through October 2023. The Butts attempted to renegotiate at the last minute, asking for $2.9 million, but Sollars attorney advised her to stick with the original price.\nOn Oct. 28, the Butts wanted to go over the sale, asking Sollars to discuss paperwork. But what Sollars didn’t know was that she was being fired and escorted off the property by police.\n“All the sudden they go, ‘You’re done. We don’t need you anymore. Give us your files and do not step foot on our property again,’” she said.\nAt this time, Sollars knew she had the Butts’ lawn mower at her home for maintenance, and she also had her own property at the venue. They wouldn’t allow her gather her property before leaving.\nA week later, things got even worse.\nThe Butts had Sollars arrested for wrongful possession after she had already returned their lawn mower and before she had her property returned.\nSollars said they called on Nov. 4 and gave her until 5 p.m. to return their lawn mower. While her husband was on his way back home from returning it, that’s when she received the surprise.\n“A cop shows up at my house and says, ‘Kim, I’m arresting you,’” she said.\nSollars said she had photo proof that her husband returned the lawn mower, but that wasn’t enough to change their minds.\nBecause it was over the weekend, Sollars spent two nights in jail. She now has a no-contact order.\n“I’m still not cleared, but they have nothing, so my attorney has nothing,” she said. “For them to do this to me, it really took my innocence away.”\nAt this time, Sollars still hadn’t received her property or any pay for her labor.\nHer attorney sent one letter for wages and one letter for her property owed. Sollars received her property — three months later — but still no pay.\n“Why did they hold (the property) for three months? No clue. Why could they get away with it? No clue.”\nAs the manager of the venue and future owner, Sollars kept track of the events, including the day they were to be held, the date of the contracts, how much they paid, and when they paid.\nThis was how she was able to see that business wasn’t going as planned. But that was not because they weren’t receiving business.\n“There was no financial hardship. No, it’s not that — they took the money and ran,” Sollars said.\nShe explained that even after the Butts fired her, they booked four more weddings, providing additional income that would cover her labor costs.\n“They could have easily paid me back my $28,000 and come clean and faithfully gone through their day about other things,” Sollars said.\nSollars mentioned other costs such as past due bills that would arrive in the mail. She had to hand deliver the mail to the Butt’s other business, Falcon Ridge Golf Course in Stacy, as they wouldn’t ever make an appearance at Circle B to pick it up.\nSollars believes there’s a chance the Butts were trying to plan for missed payments on large loans that they previously had a six-month deferment gap on.\n“Have they even made a payment to the bank? I don’t know,” she said.\nAccording to Sollars, there were two loans the Butts took out for the business, one for over $2 million, another for over $800,000. These first payments were due in August 2023, and that’s when the couple started to press her on purchasing the business, in which an agreement wasn’t quite yet made.\n“They would be like, ‘When are you buying it? When are you buying it?’ And then they would get mean,” she said.\nSollars had all of this information as her bank need the financial details and projections before approving her to move forward with an offer.\nShe was able to find a total of $218,000 has been collected for events that are no longer are taking place at Circle B, due to the closure..\nTwo business planned events were not included in the loss of funds.\nWhen it comes to fighting back legally, Sollars is not one to press an issue like this.\n“I’ve had rose colored glasses on 100% of my lifetime,” she said. “I don’t know how to go about it to be honest.\n“The likelihood of me getting it (her wages back) — I don’t know.”\nSollars said she can’t go to small claims court as the amount she’s owed is too much.\nDespite all that she’s experienced over the last year, Sollars’ mind hasn’t changed about purchasing the business.\n“Call me crazy, but yes,” she said. “I was there from the moment I opened up the wedding until they went home.\n“It was really fun.”\nSollars can’t confirm if the business is for sale as it’s been listed and then taken off the market. She hasn’t seen bankruptcy paperwork filed and she’s even reached out to their lawyer, Ryan Kaess, who isn’t providing any information either.\nSollars will fight for the venue she wants to call her ‘legacy,’ as she’s brought her family there and worked hard to make successful.\n“I know the place better than Angi and Wayne,” she said.\nIf Sollars could get into the venue and continue this wedding season, she said she would.\n“I would get back in there and give them the wedding they deserve,” she said.",

    "text": "Israel is considering taking military action against Iran — most likely without U.S. support — in the coming days, even as President Donald Trump is in advanced discussions with Tehran about a diplomatic deal to curtail its nuclear program, according to five people with knowledge of the situation.\nIsrael has become more serious about a unilateral strike on Iran as the negotiations between the United States and Iran appear closer to a preliminary or framework agreement that includes provisions about uranium enrichment that Israel views as unacceptable, according to NBC News.\nStream Connecticut News for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\n WATCH HERE\nA unilateral strike or action by Israel against Iran would be a dramatic break with the Trump administration, which has argued against such a step.\nThe Trump administration is awaiting a response from Iran about a proposed framework of a nuclear deal, and Trump has publicly said Tehran has become more hard-line in its negotiations.\nGet top local Connecticut stories delivered to you every morning with the News Headlines newsletter.\n SIGN UP\nThe notion of a new front in a simmering conflict has prompted the Trump administration to order all embassies within striking distance of Iranian missiles, aircraft and other assets (including missions in the Middle East, Northern Africa and Eastern Europe) to send cables with assessments about danger and about measures to mitigate risks to Americans and U.S. infrastructure, according to two sources familiar.\nU.S. and other officials are on alert awaiting the possibility of Israel’s striking Iran, the officials said.\nThe White House has not briefed senior lawmakers on the issue, according to that aide and a U.S. official.\nOne major concern is Iran’s retaliating against U.S. personnel or assets in the region for any action.\nIsrael, which relies on intelligence or other direct and logistical assistance from the United States, may be in a position to take unilateral action against Tehran, the source familiar said. The sources familiar and officials were not aware of any planned U.S. involvement in the possible action. The United States could support with aerial refueling or intelligence sharing rather than kinetic support, but the sources and officials were not aware of plans for that, either, at this point.\nU.S. officials have announced that the voluntary departure of nonessential employees from the region. And the Defense Department announced the voluntary departure of military families from locations all across the U.S. Central Command area of operations.\nThe CENTCOM commander, Gen. Erik Kurilla, was due to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but the hearing was postponed late Wednesday without explanation. A source familiar said Kurilla had to focus on this unfolding situation.\nAnother possible factor: Iran is rebuilding its strategic air defenses, and manned strikes will soon be exponentially more dangerous for Israeli pilots. In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran’s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt. It’s possible Israel’s window for manned strikes, without being threatened by Iran’s coordinated strategic air defenses, is closing.\nWhile Israel would most likely prefer U.S. military and intelligence support for strikes — especially against Iranian nuclear facilities — it showed in October that it can do a lot alone.\nMichael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said the evacuation of nonessential staff members at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq will send a message to Tehran that Trump will not necessarily hold Israel back from launching a threatened attack on Iran.\n“It’s about trying to get Iran to respect the president’s wishes,” Knights said.\nIran has failed to meet a two-month deadline Trump set to reach an agreement on the country’s nuclear activities, and he is frustrated, he said.\nBoth Knights and a source with knowledge of the matter said it was unclear whether Israel would undertake a limited military strike now or wait until nuclear negotiations played out further.\nTrump has expressed growing frustration over Iran’s stance at recent indirect talks, portraying Tehran as inflexible and slow-moving.\n“They’re just asking for things that you can’t do. They don’t want to give up what they have to give up,” Trump told reporters Monday. “They seek enrichment. We can’t have enrichment.”\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

    "title": "Monossido, il killer silenzioso. “Così il gas ci uccide: case troppo ermetiche sono complici”",
    "text": "Firenze, 20 dicembre 2024 – Il dottor Eugenio Pattarino è pneumologo e medico di famiglia. Perché si muore inalando il monossido di carbonio?\n“Si tratta di un gas incolore, inodore e insapore e per questo particolarmente insidioso perché non lo sentiamo. Quando viene inalato, il monossido di carbonio entra nei polmoni e si diffonde nel sangue, dove può causare gravi danni”.\nCome agisce sul nostro organismo? Perché è così pericoloso?\n“Il monossido di carbonio si lega all’emoglobina nel sangue, ossia a quella proteina che trasporta l’ossigeno dai polmoni ai tessuti e agli organi vitali del corpo. Legandosi, forma la carboxiemoglobina (COHb), che non è in grado di trasportare ossigeno. Impedisce di fatto lo scambio tra l’anidride carbonica (che non va via) e l’ossigeno (che non entra). Il sangue continua a circolare nel corpo perché non ci sono occlusioni, ma non porta ossigeno”.\nE quindi che provoca?\n“Causa un vero e proprio avvelenamento o soffocamento delle cellule del nostro corpo, in particolare al cervello e al cuore, molto sensibili all’ossigeno”.\nQuali sono i principali effetti per una persona esposta a livelli elevati di monossido di carbonio?\n“Si parla di ipossia, ossia una carenza di ossigeno nei tessuti. Nei casi gravi, la carenza può portare a perdita di coscienza, aritmie cardiache, convulsioni e danni cerebrali permanenti. Se l’esposizione è particolarmente alta, può causare la morte. È una morte silenziosa: ci si addormenta e si muore”.\nIn caso di sopravvivenza, che succede?\n“Dipende da quanto è stata prolungata l’esposizione e in quale concentrazione. Possono esserci danni permanenti agli organi vitali, al cuore e al cervello: anche brevi periodi di ipossia cerebrale possono causare problemi perenni gravi. Nel caso del cuore, l’ipossia può provocare aritmie cardiache fatali”.\nPer chi viene soccorso in tempo, che terapie ci sono?\n“Di solito viene fatta la terapia iperbarica con ossigeno puro per accelerare l’eliminazione del monossido di carbonio dal corpo e ripristinare i livelli di ossigeno nei tessuti oppure inserendo il paziente in una camera iperbarica con ossigeno ad alta pressione per cercare di ridurre i danni”.\nPerché in una abitazione nuova possono verificarsi incidenti del genere?\n“È il risultato delle nostre case ermetiche. Un tempo si moriva con i bracieri, ma molti si salvavano perché le abitazioni avevano spifferi. Ora c’è poco ricambio d’aria; se c’è una fuga di gas o una bombola che perde o una stufa con tiraggio che non funziona, si brucia ossigeno, l’ossido di carbonio rimane nella stanza e il rischio è molto elevato. Fondamentale la manutenzione costante della caldaia”.\nApprofondisci: Le stufe a pellet, la caldaia: famiglia uccisa dal monossido, le indagini. “Tutto è accaduto di sera”",

    "text": "Temitayo Jaiyeola, Edidiong Ikpoto and Dare Olawin The British American Tobacco and its affiliate companies have been fined the sum of $110m. by the Federal Government, through the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. In a statement by FCCPC on Wednesday, it was revealed that the fine was for alleged infringements of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act, National Tobacco Control Act, and sundry legal instruments. The commission further stated that BAT must subject itself to compliance and monitoring for a period of 24 months, mandatory public health and tobacco control advocacy, and provisions of written assurances to the commission. “In exchange for BAT Parties fulfilling their obligations under the Consent Order, the commission withdrew pending criminal charges against BATN and at least one employee with respect to obstructing the commission by attempting to prevent execution of the search warrant and initial lack of cooperation/compliance with steps in the investigation,” the commission said. The FCCPC said the decision followed its “active” investigation into British American Tobacco Nigeria Limited and other affiliated companies (BAT Parties) on August 28, 2020, after it received credible pieces of information and intelligence. Commenting on the resolution, it stated, “During the year ending 2023, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission came to a final resolution with British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited (BATN, British American Tobacco Marketing (Nigeria) Limited (BATMN), British American Tobacco Plc, British American Tobacco (Holdings) Limited (all together referred to as BAT Parties) with respect to a range of infringements of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act, National Tobacco Control Act and sundry legal instruments.” According to the commission, it carried out an order and warrant of search and seizure, approved by a Federal High Court, at BAT locations and the location of a service provider on January 25, 2021. It disclosed that it gathered, received, and procured substantial evidence from forensic analysis of electronic communications and other information/data obtained during the search, as well as other evidence procured during, and after the search from other legitimate sources. It added that additional investigation, including proffers, hearings, transcripts of sworn testimonies, and continuing analysis of evidence established and supported multiple violations of the FCCPA and other enactments. It highlighted that during the investigation and in furtherance of mutual engagements between the commission and BAT Parties, BAT Parties, in writing sought, and the commission accepted BAT Parties into cooperation under the Commission’s Cooperation/Assistance Rules & Procedure, 2021. It clarified that this provides for benefits such as possible reduced monetary penalties; waiver of the application of the commission’s Administrative Penalties Regulations 2020; as well as prosecutorial discretion, particularly Rules 5.1 and 5.3 (subject to compliance with Rules 3 and 5.4). The FCCPC noted that its penalties were reached upon full consideration of the record, BAT Parties’ additional articulation representations, and correspondence. Part of the verdict of the investigation read: “That BAT Parties shall pay a penalty of $110,000,000 under and pursuant to Section 155 of the FCCPA, Clause 11 of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission’s Administrative Penalties Regulations, 2020 and Clause 4.2 of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission’s Investigative Cooperation/Assistance Rules and Procedures, 2021.” The commission stated that it remained committed to promoting and ensuring fair market practices while protecting consumer interests. It added, “A distorted market redounds only to the benefit of those who engage in malfeasance, is at the expense of others, and exploitation of consumers while undermining a stable economy. It compromises a constitutional and national priority of economic growth and shared prosperity.” Recently the Executive Vice Chairman of FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, revealed that businesses must be held accountable and made to face the consequences when they err. He said this while disclosing that the commission generated N56bn, mainly from penalties, as Internally Generated Revenue in 2023. While noting that 90 per cent of the IGR was mainly from penalties, he said, “What makes the market stable is holding businesses accountable. The consequence management system is what we have adopted. “We are not trying to close down businesses, but they must know that if you snooze, you lose. You cannot distort the market and expect that there will be no consequences.” The External Affairs Director of the company, Odiri Erewa-Meggison when contacted, told our correspondent to send an inquiry via text message.
