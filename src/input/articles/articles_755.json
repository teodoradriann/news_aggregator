    "text": "Tech will drive learning of students, teachers For children, there are numerous apps like Akshara’s Building Blocks which make learning joyful and help the child acquire and retain conceptual clarity. Published: 06th January 2024 06:24 AM | Last Updated: 06th January 2024 06:24 AM | A+A A- Good education for millions of our children, especially in primary and higher secondary levels, has been a cause of concern for all. Several research surveys and dipstick analyses have shown poor learning outcomes for our children. We have to be optimistic that things will turn around and I for one, after having met and talked to several hundreds of various stakeholders, see a lot of interesting things that will happen in the coming calendar year and beyond. It should not be a surprise that the Covid pandemic has taught us all a few lessons that can be applied for good. I believe that people have started to believe in the adage, ‘It takes a village to educate a child’ and these are the stakeholders who have started to make positive contributions to the education of our children. So what do I think will happen as we look forward? More access to good content (for teachers and students alike) Both children and teachers will have access to more good content because of the creation of the Diksha platform which hosts content in several state languages (s). Many players. including my own organisation Akshara Foundation, have shared their content on this platform. For example, at Akshara Foundation we make our content freely available and in multiple languages. The teachers get to use teacher training content as audio-video modules and in byte-sized formats so that they can refresh themselves on specific topics before they head to the classroom. For children, there are numerous apps like Akshara’s Building Blocks which make learning joyful and help the child acquire and retain conceptual clarity. All of this is in the public domain and the emergence of a Creative Commons framework of licensing and usage will make a big difference to the availability of content. Thank you Lawrence Lessig and Eric Eldred for pioneering this concept. As we go forward teachers who feel handicapped because of lack of adequate training will have training available electronically on-demand and this will increase their effectiveness in classrooms. Increased stakeholder involvement I can see that more stakeholders in the communities, like parents and other community members, elected representatives at the local level, School Development Management Committee members and others who when presented with data on their children’s learning outcomes are more than willing to invest their time and resources in ensuring a better future for their children. At Akshara Foundation, we specifically have the experience of facilitating Gram Panchayat level maths contests where participation has been very good. Local volunteers to keep it going Young people in rural communities have a well-developed sense of giving back to their local communities in a practical manner and it is this youth that forms the backbone of sustainability of any initiative that is introduced in villages. During Covid times, they managed to convince people in rural communities to take their vaccine doses. These youth become a vibrant force and a voice for better education. Blended learning will be a driving force Technology will play a more significant role as we go forward. With the increasing availability of smartphones among rural populace, and with the key smartphone user willing to share time on the smartphone with the children, we can see that a large number of children will start to supplement their classroom instructions with content available on the Internet. An innovation using the Diksha platform (digital infrastructure for knowledge sharing) and school textbooks has become useful for children to expand or solidify their learning. Textbooks have QR codes printed in each chapter which, when scanned, takes the student to good content on Diksha and this serves as the perfect supplement to classroom instruction. In the near future, a combination of Teacher+Technology which I would like to call Blended Learning will make its way more into classrooms and in student learning trajectories. All these trends need to be suitably recognised by all and I strongly believe that the media has a big role in bringing visibility to these issues in a positive manner. Transforming education in the 21st century will be challenging but will also provide opportunities for innovation and advanced technology, which, in turn, will motivate and equip teachers better.",

    "text": "CANTERBURY (UNITED KINGDOM)\nUnion of Catholic Asian News (UCA News) [Hong Kong]\nFebruary 23, 2024\nBy Michael Kelly\nA report, released Feb. 21, says the church cannot be trusted to investigate sexual abuse without outside involvement\nA new report has revealed what it describes as conflicts of interest in the handling of allegations of sexual abuse in Britain’s established state church, the Church of England.\nThe report, released Feb. 21, found that despite numerous reviews, the church cannot be trusted to investigate allegations of sexual abuse without outside involvement.\nThe former chair of a government-ordered Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse said policies around the protection of children and vulnerable adults within the denomination are “flawed” and “cannot be sufficiently improved whilst it remains within church oversight.”\nAlexis Jay concludes in the report: “(The church) needs to fundamentally change in order to restore the confidence of victims, survivors and others, including clergy.”\n“This can only be achieved by being delivered by a fully independent body,” she writes. Jay is a visiting professor at Strathclyde University, where she chairs the Center for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland.\nThe report proposes the establishment of two separate charities, independent of the church, one with operational responsibility for safeguarding and the other to provide scrutiny and oversight.\nJay insisted that the proposed new independent bodies need to be funded by the church and that anyone complaining of abuse in the church should be referred to them as soon as possible.\n“Further tinkering with existing structures would not be sufficient to make safeguarding in the Church professional, accountable and trusted by those who use its services,” she said.\nArchbishop Justin Welby of Canterbury and Archbishop Stephen Cottrell of York — the two primates in the Church of England — welcomed the report’s “wisdom, expertise and meticulous proposals.”\nAccording to Jay, “There are conflicts of interest in several aspects of safeguarding, which are not openly acknowledged or addressed in policy, procedures or practice.”\n“This serves to further undermine the trust of many of those who need to engage with church safeguarding,” the academic expert said in one of her conclusions.\nJay was called in by the Church of England in the summer of 2023 following the bishops disbanding their own Independent Safeguarding Board after panel members accused the hierarchy of obstructing their work.\nHer research also included experiences of those who had made abuse allegations to the church. She reported that some survivors talked of feeling like the system had, in their words, been “weaponized against them,” and many respondents reported an “all-time low” in relations between the bishops and survivors.\nIn a statement, the archbishops of Canterbury and of York, said: “We recognize her criticism of our safeguarding structures and processes, and we welcome this scrutiny and challenge. For the sake of all those who come into contact with the church, particularly victims and survivors, we welcome the plans that are in place to take forward this work as swiftly as possible.”\nIn 2023, church leaders announced funding of some $190 million for redress for abuse survivors.\nThe Church of England is the country’s largest denomination, tracing its history back to Henry VIII’s split with Rome in the 16th century and counting King Charles as the supreme governor, although the monarch has little day-to-day involvement in ecclesiastical affairs.",

    "text": "Comenzó este mediodía la medida de lucha tiene lugar en medio de las amenazas del Gobierno y de la feroz campaña de los medios oficialistas contra el derecho a reclamar. A horas de comenzar el paro el directorio de Aerolíneas despidió a tres pilotos. Al reclamo por salario se suma a exigencia de reincorporación por despidos persecutrios. Trabajadores de otros sectores apoyan esta pelea. Trabajadoras y trabajadores aeronáuticos comenzaron este viernes al mediodía una nueva medida de fuerza en reclamo por recomposición salarial. Se extenderá por 24 horas. Alcanzará a los aeropuertos de Ezeiza y Aeroparque. [Ahora] Comenzó el paro de trabajadores y trabajadoras aeronáuticos. Desde el Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, [@Lucho_Aguilar2] informa sobre las razones de este medida de lucha [pic.twitter.com/bTiGfaLgkk] — La Izquierda Diario (@izquierdadiario) [September 13, 2024] El atraso salarial ya lleva 6 meses, mientras el personal de call center tiene salarios de 500 mil pesos y los trabajadores de rampa 800 mil. A esto se le debe sumar el vaciamiento y desfinanciamiento que el Gobierno nacional impone sobre Aerolíneas Argentinas con el fin de privatizarla. El vocero Manuel Adorni informó que hoy el presidente Javier Milei va a firmar la reglamentación del artículo 182 del DNU, que establece los lineamientos para declarar la Aeronáutica Civil y Comercial como servicio esencial. El Gobierno pone a este conflicto como testigo para avanzar contra el conjunto de los trabajadores. En el anuncio de la medida, desde APLA (Asociación de Pilotos de Líneas Aéreas) indicaron que la medida está motivada por “la falta de propuestas de la empresa”. Al mismo tiempo, exigen que “Aerolíneas ponga sobre la mesa una propuesta seria de recomposición salarial”. El paro también fue convocado por AAA Asociación Argentina de Aeronavegantes y en esta oportunidad se sumo el personal de tierra enrolado en APA (Asociación del Personal Aeronáutico), de esta forma el paro alcanzaría a entorpecer a otras aerolíneas como las Low Cost. A días de comenzar ese nuevo paro, desde el directorio de Aerolíneas Argentinas despidió a tres pilotos por el simple echo de haberse sumado al paro de la semana pasada. Los pilotos ejerciendo su derecho a la protesta se negaron a efectuar una operación de devolución de una aeronave Embrer EMB-190. Con esta medida de perscusión sindical solo logra que \"El conflicto se agrava y solo tendrá un final cuando los salarios sean recompuestos con todos/as los/las pilotos en sus puestos de trabajo\" dejó claro el sindicato. Por su parte, desde el gremio que agrupa a los y las aeronavegantes AAA, afirmaron que \"la brutal escalada a la que tanto las autoridades nacionales como empresariales nos han empujado con su irracionalidad e intransigencia, no ha dejado abierta ninguna otra alternativa para defender no sólo nuestros salarios, sino más importante aún, nuestro futuro\". Esta pelea viene siendo atacada por el Gobierno y por los medios afines al oficialismo, que despliegan una furiosa campaña contra el derecho a reclamar y contra los supuestos “privilegios” que tienen trabajadores y trabajadoras. Al mismo tiempo, ese ataque constituye parte de un plan privatista que tiene el Gobierno y que viene siendo planteado por Milei desde el primer día de gestión. Aunque haya que tenido que bajarlo de la Ley Bases, es un proyecto de largo plazo que busca reducir derechos de trabajadores y trabajadoras al tiempo que abrir los cielos argentinos a los negociados de diversas empresas privadas.

    "text": "ARKANSAS, USA — A suspected\nChinese surveillance balloon has been spotted flying across the skies in the United States.\nWhile the\nU.S. government has been tracking it, reports have the balloon spotted over Montana on Feb. 2, and over the central states on Feb. 3, and even as close as Missouri.\nThe balloon has been measured as cruising at around 60,000 feet in the air while drifting southeast. Models show the balloon making it to the South Carolina coastline at around noon on Saturday. Friday night is expected to leave Missouri, cross over southern Illinois, western & central Kentucky, and northeastern Tennessee. By Saturday morning it will be over North Carolina.\nThe winds at 60,000 FT are blowing the balloon about 40-50 MPH to the southeast. It'll be back over international waters in the Atlantic by Saturday evening (February 4, 2023).\nUsing an\nNOAA Hysplit model, a spaghetti plot shows the possibilities of where it could be flying over next. This model is usually used to track where the wind takes volcanic ash to keep air traffic safe from ingesting pollutants.\nDuring a Feb. 3 press conference, Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said if the government shot the balloon down, there's a possibility the debris could harm property or even people whenever it'd make landfall.\nAnother thing to note is that at 60,000 feet, the balloon is above commercial airspace. Ryder said the balloon does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground.\nIn a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement, the Chinese government confirmed ownership of the balloon, but said it is being used for “research, mainly meteorological, purposes.”",

Con este tipo de actividades expulsan a la gente normal del centro de las ciudades.\n[#4](c4#c-4) a mí esto me suena a felicidad impostada. A Mr Wonderfull, a querer tapar una fuga de agua con buenas intenciones, a Teletubbies modernos. Pero que sabré yo que soy un triste\n[#4](c4#c-4) Eso digo yo, otra cosa sería que lo hicieran con música en altavoces. Si a la gente no le importa hacer el ridículo, y se lo pasan bien así, por mi perfecto.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Depende de cuantos sean y por dónde pasen, supongo. Si se meten en medio de la plaza de la reina o delante del palau de la música y son 25 personas caben tranquilamente, pero si se meten esos mismos 25 en una acera de 3 metros como se ve en la captura... pues joden 15m de acera \"a su ritmo\" por la puta cara.\nHace años ya se liaron pollos con los segway, porque ni contaminan ni hacen ruido, pero cuando van unos cuantos juntos colapsan calles y cruces.\n[#14](c14#c-14) porque seguramente moleste al resto, tu ves un grupo de flipados bailando, te mererias en su camino? pasarias entre ellos? le dejarías paso a todos priorizandolos?\nTampoco hay que pensar mucho para darse cuenta que es una molestia\n[#4](c4#c-4) Pues sí. Esa parece la moda, criticar a una de las actividades que más ingresos generan en este país. Otra cosa que sí es criticable es la actitud de la gente, la mala educación, etc. Pero eso desgraciadamente lo padecemos a diario en todos los ámbitos, en el trabajo, en la calle, en el supermercado, etc. No es exclusivo del turismo. Pero vamos, que si tan malo es puede que tengamos que reorientar la producción hacia el sector primario.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Actividad económica que genera beneficios para pocos y molestias para muchos, atrae trabajadores con sueldos míseros y provoca un encarecimiento sin precedentes de los alquileres. Dear tourist enjoy balconing.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Mucho amargado que no tiene un duro para irse de vacaciones y en vez de cagarse en la madre que pario a su empresa que le paga una mierda, se desahoga odiando turistas\n[#4](c4#c-4) Estoy de acuerdo pero... No es lo mismo una persona con auriculares bailando por la calle que un grupo de diez o veinte, con \"coreografías\" y ocupando todo el espacio. Sin ver ningún vídeo es difícil opinar, pero por lo leído tiene que ser un poquito incordiante.\n[#4](c4#c-4) No es quejarse por quejarse, mucha gente si, pero otros no tanto.\nVivo en mallorca y mi ingresos vienen gracias al turismo.\nAún así, hay que reconocer que no todo vale. Ya que hay actividades que pueden ser muy guays para los turistas pero realmente molestas para la gente que vive en la zona.\nPor ejemplo, aquí se han limitado los tours de buggies y motos de agua. Debido a que hacen un tour cada hora durante 8 horas por los mismos caminos y calas. Para la gente que vive en las zonas de paso es insoportable.\nY volviendo a la noticia, realmente es muy molesto los grupos de turistas. Como cruceristas, estos bailando, etc, debido a que no es lo mismo 50 turistas paseando a su bola que 50 turistas haciendo lo mismo, los segundos bloquean por completo.\nY el problema no es que haya 1 grupo, es que hay 3-4 grupos cada hora.\nLas críticas que yo defiendo son contra la masificación, no se puede todo para todos.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Quejarse del turismo puede tener sentido, porque en muchos sitios es excesivo. Pero no habría que quejarse al turista, que poca o ninguna culpa tiene, sino más bien a los que se están lucrando con los alquileres turísticos (y de paso, dificultando el acceso a la vivienda) y a los gobiernos que lo permiten. Quita eso, y en muchos sitios la cantidad de turistas ya volvería a ser aceptable. Para el resto, tasas turísticas hasta obtener un influjo razonable.\nPero claro, siempre es más fácil echar la culpa al débil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) En el Retiro hay muchos, además de estos, haciendo flashmobing, k-pop, influencers y demás. Un par de broncas he tenido por pasar por donde están haciendo sus movidas, pero me la suda. Me empiezo a parecer al señor que se sienta en el banco del parque detrás de la streamer: \"Your followers? Oh, are you Jesus now? are you?\"\nEnésimo artículo de mierda sobre el tema cansino del verano para que la gente haga el clic correspondiente y el periódico gane dinerito, que está la cosa mu achuchá.\nHay que ser imbécil o tener un problema mental para que te moleste que haya gente bailando sin hacer ruido.\nA ver, si no molestan con auriculares no me parece mal.

    "title": "Girl attacked by coyote at southern Alberta rest stop",
    "text": "A 10-year-old girl had to wrangle with a coyote after it grabbed her leg and tried to drag her into a rural field on Boxing Day. It happened at a rest stop near Ralston in Cypress County, southeast of Calgary, at around 7 p.m. The incident left Hailey Nyberg with minor injuries. “I got out of the car to go use the washroom and something came running at me. I thought it was a dog but it wasn’t, it was a coyote,” she told CityNews. “It grabbed onto my leg three times trying to pull me into the field. “I was terrified. I thought it was a dream.” Her dad, Dustin, says he and his wife, Alyshia, were in the car keeping an eye on Hailey and didn’t notice anything wrong initially, but then became horrified when he heard a scream and went on high alert. “My wife was on the passenger side and she opened the door and could see the coyote there. And then she yelled at me that there was a coyote and she started making noise and banging on the car. And then I went to go get Hailey,” he said. Watch: Calgary northwest residents worried about coyotes Dustin says he leaped out of the car and jumped into action, saying he had to rip his daughter from the coyote’s grasp. “I ran up to her and I was yelling, trying to be as loud as possible and hoping that maybe he would then let go, but he didn’t,” he said. “I was able to grab her waist, and while I was grabbing her, pulling on her, (the coyote) was still pulling on her at that time. He was still latched on, so I just had to kick my feet and then he gave up and let go.” Dustin says he was able to get Hailey into the car but adds the animal continued to charge at him after he put himself between it and his daughter. “He still was lunging at us. I was able to kind of tuck her behind me and we moved towards the car and he still came towards us,” Dustin said.

I’m on medicine now,” Hailey said. “I feel a little bit still scared.” Dustin says he called Alberta Fish and Wildlife to report what happened, and rangers said it was concerning for them. They called back within minutes assuring him it was being taken “very seriously.” “They’re not taking it lightly at all,” he said. “When a child gets attacked by a coyote … that’s a dangerous level of human-to-wild-animal interaction.” After posting about the situation on Facebook, several people reached out to the family to say they had seen others feeding coyotes at that exact spot. This has not been confirmed by Fish and Wildlife but rangers have assured they are going to investigate the area. Growing up in southern Alberta, Dustin says being around coyotes is common, and they tend to be afraid of people. However, he’s cautioning against feeding the animals and urging people to be more aware when they are around. “They’re wild animals don’t … feed them … we’ll do our thing, let them do theirs,” he said. “We were always taught that they’re … more scared of us than we are them, and (in) this case, that wasn’t the case at all. So … take caution, be aware of what’s going on, and just leave wild animals alone.”",

    "text": "• Mediators meet in Cairo in effort to bridge gaps on truce proposal • Biden presses Netanyahu on urgency of sealing a deal for ceasefire CAIRO: Israeli forces pressed deeper into areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip as they battled Hamas fighters, while Palestinian health officials said on Thursday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 27 people across the enclave. The new escalation comes hours after US President Joe Biden pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the urgency of sealing a deal for a truce in Gaza and the release of prisoners, the White House said. Separately, US and Israeli delegations started a new round of meetings in Cairo on Thursday to secure a ceasefire deal. Months of on-off talks on a ceasefire have circled the same issues, but Israel and Hamas have stuck firmly to their demands. In the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, a strike on a house killed 11 people, including children and women, the bodies of some of whom had been burnt, according to the territory’s Civil Emergency Service. Medics said another strike killed six people, including a local journalist, in a house in Al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip, while five others were killed in separate strikes in the south. Later on Thursday, five Palestinians were killed and several wounded in an Israeli airstrike that hit people near a square in Khan Younis, health officials said. The Israeli military said its forces had intensified their operations in Deir Al-Balah, in central Gaza, and Khan Younis, in the south, dismantling dozens of structures over the past 24 hours. It claimed forces killed 50 fighters in the area of Rafah, in the far south of the enclave, over the past day. The armed wing of Hamas said fighters ambushed an Israeli force in Rafah, killing and wounding several of them. Tanks and drones In the central Gaza town of Deir Al-Balah, which houses around one million residents and displaced Palestinians, according to the municipal council, residents said tanks advanced further from the east and blocked some roads connecting the city with the nearby Khan Younis in the south. Israeli tanks have also advanced to the west, in Al-Karara and Hamad areas of Khan Younis, pushing more families out of their shelters and tents, sometimes under heavy fire from tanks and drones, residents said. Some families slept on the roads, others on the beach after they failed to find space or shelter. A phone call between Biden and Netanyahu late on Wednesday followed a whirlwind trip to the region by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that ended on Tuesday without producing a breakthrough in the 10-month-old war. Cairo meetings US and Israeli delegations started a new round of meetings in Cairo on Thursday aimed at resolving differences over a truce proposal to end more than 10 months of war in Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said. Egyptian and US officials had met to seek compromises over plans for providing security on the border between Egypt and Gaza following an Israeli military withdrawal demanded by Hamas, the sources said. The proposals were due to be presented to Israeli officials later, with a Qatari delegation due to join on Friday, they added. Egypt along with the United States and Qatar has been a mediator in months of stop-start negotiations to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, as well as the release of Israeli and Palestinian prisoners. Israeli demands to keep troops deployed along the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts across Gaza, as well as in a buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt known as the Philadelphi Corridor, have emerged as the most significant obstacles to a deal. Egypt as well as Hamas want Israel to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor, where Israeli troops advanced in May. Israel alleges Hamas has used the area to bring arms into Gaza. Egypt says it has shut off smuggling routes. The meetings in Cairo on Thursday and Friday follow a trip to the region by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that failed to produce a breakthrough in negotiations.

It's action, it's a street fighter, it's fighting everything like that,\" said coach at Martial Arts of Waco, Tracey Thompson.\nAt face value, people see martial arts for its violence, but looking beyond, it can be seen that there's more.\n\"I would say the fellowship and the brotherhood — there's a lot of trust when it comes to sparring and training and especially when we're talking about throwing punches, and to dial it back and still be able to get up and go to work the next day, just that trust that's there as well,\" Turner said.\n\"The athletic aspect of it — everybody thinks they can come in here straight off the street, you know, you get people who storm gyms, 'Oh, I'm a street fighter', stuff like that,\" Thompson said.\n\"As soon as they go, they're ducking their head — 30 seconds you're done. You don't know how to pace yourself, you have no condition, you can't hold your hands up,\" he said.\nPeople of all ages join for classes, and that first day experience is truly unforgettable.\n\"It's totally different — it's definitely something new, you think you know some things, and then it's just like, 'Ok, let's just take that all away and start over,\" said student, Stance Harrell.\n\"But I would definitely recommend it though, because it's always good to learn new things.\"\n\"It's an everybody sport — age has a factor in it but everybody who comes in here for the exercise of it makes them feel younger,\" Thompson said.\nWhatever path you take to achieve your resolution, always remember to follow through and finish.",
