    "text": "Fox News Vatican says bishops allowed to withhold same-sex blessings sanctioned by recent document Timothy Nerozzi December 28, 2023 at 9:47 PM · 3 min read Link Copied Read full article Vatican says bishops allowed to withhold same-sex blessings sanctioned by recent document\nThe Vatican has clarified that each bishop is free to either adopt or ignore its recommendation for \"spontaneous\" blessings of people in a same-sex relationship.\nCardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, prefect for the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF) and author of the controverstial Fiducia Supplicans , told Spanish news outlet ABC that bishops must make a \"discernment\" for themselves whether to implement the sanctioned blessings.\nFernández affirmed that the guidance does not diverge from traditional Catholic doctrine, saying \"if the text is read with an even disposition, it can be seen that it supports with great clarity and simplicity the perennial Catholic teaching on marriage and sexuality,\" according to translations from Catholic News Agency.\nPOLISH, UKRAINIAN BISHOPS JOIN GROWING COALITION AGAINST VATICAN'S SAME-SEX BLESSINGS DOCUMENT\nVíctor Manuel Fernández, Prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, poses during the courtesy visits to the New Cardinals at the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City, Vatican.\nHowever, Fernández expressed understanding that in many contexts a blessing could be misunderstood or overly scrutinized, causing confusion or scandal.\nSpeaking of African bishops who have rejected the idea of ever blessing a person in an open homosexual relationship, Fernández expressed sympathy that in many countries \"there is legislation that penalizes with prison the mere fact of declaring oneself to be gay, imagine [what a] a blessing [would do],\" according to CNA.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe prefect added that \"it’s proper for each local bishop to make that discernment in his diocese or in any case, to give further guidance.\"\nCATHOLIC BISHOPS AROUND THE WORLD PUSH BACK ON BLESSINGS FOR PEOPLE IN SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS\nCardinals, bishops and prelates attend the opening Mass of the XVI Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City.\n\"Fiducia supplicants\" reaffirmed the Catholic Church's inability to change the sacrament of marriage, which it defines as an \"exclusive, stable, and indissoluble union between a man and a woman, naturally open to the generation of children.\"\nIt did, however, carve out allowances for \"spontaneous\" blessings given to individuals in same-sex relationships who are seeking to lead more moral lives. It also clarifies that the \"union\" between two members of the same sex cannot be blessed — only the individuals themselves.\nEpiscopal conferences in African nations have been the most vocal prelates opposed to the implementation of \"Fiducia supplicans\" — the document which approved pastoral blessings given to people in same-sex relationships under strict parameters.\nArchbishop George Desmond Tambala of the Lilongwe Catholic Archdiocese (C) flanked by a Muslim Sheikh (L) and other religious leaders, carries an anti-LGBTQ placard during nation-wide marches organised by churches in Malawi against same-sex marriages in Lilongwe.\n\"In order to avoid any pastoral confusion and ambiguity as well as not to break the law of our country which forbids same sex unions and activities, and while listening to our cultural heritage which does not accept same sex relationships, the Conference guides that the Declaration from the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith of December 18th 2023 concerning the blessing of same-sex couples be taken as for further reflection and not for implementation in Zambia,\" said the Zambia Episcopal Conference.\nThe Episcopal Conference of Malawi wrote in a letter, \"to avoid creating confusion among the faithful we direct that for pastoral reasons, blessings of any kind and for same sex unions of any kind are not permitted in Malawi.\"\nThe majority of bishops in the United States have vouched for the accuracy of the document's language, saying it is theologically in line with church teaching and tradition .\nOriginal article source: Vatican says bishops allowed to withhold same-sex blessings sanctioned by recent document\nView comments",

    "title": "Year of elections, especially in US, to shape Ukraine, Gaza and wider conflicts | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",
    "text": "As 2023 draws to a close, both sides in the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts signalled they expect continued fighting through much of the new year when dozens of countries, including the United States, go to the polls.\nAbout two billion people in at least 50 countries will hold elections in 2024, including in India, Russia, Britain, the European Union and across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.\nSome are more unpredictable than others – few expect Vladimir Putin not to win another six years in office in Russia’s presidential vote in March. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fate is seen as tied to the war in Gaza. Many expect him to be ousted as soon as it ends.\nIt remains unclear whether Ukraine will hold its own presidential vote in March. But the election that matters most for the world at large is November’s U.S. presidential vote, and whether or Donald Trump returns to office.\nThe difficulties of predicting who will win, as well as what a more unrestrained, anti-establishment Trump might do in power, in part help explain the dynamics in multiple conflicts across the world. Put simply, all sides want to be positioned as best they can before the November vote and possible changes in U.S. foreign policy.\nIt is a dynamic that says much about the state of international power, with increasingly assertive rivals to a perceived declining but still powerful United States, whose own internal politics look more and more unbridgeable.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s leaning on self-ruled Taiwan and military pressure against the Philippines see Moscow and Beijing willing to use methods that until recently would have felt almost unthinkable against Washington’s allies.\nThe Biden administration has interpreted those as deliberate tests of U.S. power, arguing that the United States needs to stand behind its allies while avoiding unnecessary escalation.\nThat is already proving a challenging path. Israel’s war in Gaza has shown that U.S. influence can be limited. The Netanyahu government arguably believes it can act as it can in Gaza without losing the broad support of the United States, despite increasingly public U.S. calls for moderation.\nFor Washington, the rising attacks on Red Sea shipping are just one sign of the regional spillover of that war. This week saw the United States attack Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq, following what U.S. officials say have been more than 100 attacks against U.S. forces there and in Syria since the middle of October.\nLargely outside the headlines, experts warn that ongoing civil conflict in Sudan and Myanmar could also escalate in 2024, with the Kremlin and to a lesser extent Beijing backing ruling forces attempting to cling to power as several million people face hunger and displacement.\nPRE-ELECTION POSITIONING\nEvents in the Middle East raise the proposition that the early months of 2024 could see further escalation there, deepening U.S. overstretch in the run-up to a perhaps chaotic November presidential vote.\nAt worst, these multiple crises may essentially fuel each other, just as the Ukraine conflict has forced up global food prices and deepened already serious humanitarian situations in poorer countries and conflict zones around the world.\nWithin Ukraine and Eastern Europe, there is no shortage of complaints that the United States and its European allies could have done more to arm the Kyiv government in 2023, and that it may now be too late to achieve breakthroughs in 2024.\nThey are likely to intensify given Republican congressional opposition to further U.S. support and the very real prospect that a Trump administration might cut off Kyiv entirely and force it to sue for peace.\nIn other areas, however, the actions of a Trump administration are much harder to predict. In his first term, Trump was outspoken in criticising China, flirting with more open support for Taiwan that has been continued by the Biden administration.\nThe Republican front-runner is sufficiently unpredictable, however – as is his choice of senior officials – that it is impossible to guarantee what path he might take on relations with Beijing, including how hawkish a Trump-run administration might prove.\nWho runs the government in Taiwan, which China claims as its own, will be determined in a Jan. 13 presidential vote. Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Lai Ching-te looks likely to beat the opposition Kuomintang that favours much friendlier relations with Beijing.\nA DPP victory would combine with ongoing Chinese pressure on the Philippines over its military presence on disputed islands in the South China Sea. As with the current face-off with the Iran-backed Houthis in the Red Sea, these are confrontations on which the Biden administration would like to limit divisive headlines and escalation in the run-up to November.\nOTHER POWER DYNAMICS\nOther elections will also drive battlefield dynamics and other less-lethal confrontations. Putin’s reaction, some suspect, to a Trump win could prompt him to further militarise the Russian economy and push for full mobilisation to attack Ukraine even more mercilessly.\nEuropean parliamentary elections in June will be closely watched for signs of further rises in support for far right parties, particularly after November’s election in the Netherlands saw long-running Prime Minister Mark Rutte lose his majority. Some expect him to quit Dutch politics in the coming months, potentially to take over from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at its July summit in Washington.\nFurther far right victories would be seen as positive for Putin, particularly after Slovakia dropped support for Ukraine after nationalist and populist Robert Fico won elections in September.\nIn Britain, where Labour leader Keir Starmer is likely to win elections timetabled for some point next year, a new government may hope to win over nearby allies by following Canada and Germany in committing more forces to Eastern Europe. Overall, however, worries over a potential U.S. pullback are likely to increase the clout and strategic importance of rearming major European governments, particularly those in Warsaw and Berlin.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win India’s April-May elections – but a reluctance to look weak following a Houthi missile strike on an Indian tanker has helped prompt New Delhi to send warships to the Red Sea, a region in which India has historically attempted to avoid becoming too enmeshed.\nMore broadly, actual or postponed elections in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia are seen potentially as part of a growing trend towards authoritarianism across Asia and the world. Each year of the 2020s has seen a major shock so far – 2024 will determine whether that trend continues.\nSource: Reuters (Editing by Nick Macfie)\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",
