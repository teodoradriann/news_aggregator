    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "Last Updated on Mini-PCs, despite being, well, mini in size, often aren’t as small in terms of their price. Fortunately, Minisforum has options for every budget, especially now that they’ve released their UN100D model, part of their more affordable Venus Series of diminutive computing machines. According to [Minisforum](https://www.pcguide.com/news/minisforum-teases-a-not-quite-mini-pc-complete-with-a-water-cooling-system/)‘s [product page](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-un100d?variant=44988920692981), the UN100D is priced at a very budget-friendly $199.00 USD (regional pricing varies) for the base model, which includes 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. You can also upgrade to a 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD version for $10 more at $209. Finally, there’s a 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD variant that costs $219, which may be the best option out of the lot. Of course, since this is a minimally-priced machine, you shouldn’t expect high-end specs to decorate its interior. Minisforum UN100D is perfect for basic computing tasks The UN100D is equipped with the Intel N100 processor, with 4 cores, 4 threads, and 6MB cache, so don’t expect to do any high-end gaming on this machine. It also only has Intel UHD graphics built-in, further limiting its creative capabilities. However, it does come with plenty of storage options. Aside from including either a 256GB or 512GB M.2 SSD, it also has a 2.5-inch HDD and TF card slot to bolster its data capacity. So, even though you won’t be performing any groundbreaking activities on this device, you’ll at least have a reliable mini-PC to store your most important files on. Overall, the UN100D, though unsurprisingly limited, is ideal for anyone who wants an affordable computer that doesn’t take up a ton of space. With its base models retailing at only $199, finding a better alternative at this price point would undoubtedly be difficult. That said, if you’re curious about what other options there are in the portable computer space, check out this [Ryzen 7 mini-PC](https://www.pcguide.com/news/ryzen-7-mini-pc-deal-sees-budget-friendly-gaming-machine-packaged-with-30-gift-card/) as well.",

    "text": "El comité de [Nordex Energy Spain](https://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/economia/2024/06/19/plantilla-nordex-barasoain-protesta-bloqueo-8378919.html) ha convocado entre el lunes y jueves de esta semana paros en defensa de la renovación del convenio colectivo, que caducó en 2022 y que cubre a más de 1.200 personas trabajadoras en la Comunidad Foral.\nLa parte social, compuesta por once delegados de ELA, seis de UGT, cuatro de CCOO y dos de LAB, registró paros de una hora cada uno de los cuatro días, entre las 11.00 y las 12.00 horas. Esta protesta se completó con concentraciones en los diferentes centros de trabajo que tiene la compañía distribuidos por la Comunidad Foral: el lunes en Sarriguren, el martes en Mutilva, el miércoles en Tajonar y Barásoain y el jueves en la Ciudad del Transporte.\nCentro matriz en Barásoain\nNordex Energy Spain fabrica aerogeneradores con planta y matriz en Barásoain, factoría en la que trabajan unas cien personas como mano de obra directa para la producción de las turbinas.\nEl comité plantea un convenio para cuatro años (2023-2026); subidas salariales según el IPC para evitar la pérdida de poder adquisitivo; regular el teletrabajo en el convenio; consolidar el bonus a la paga variable por objetivos; compensar las horas extra; y otras mejoras sociales.\nLa próxima reunión con la empresa para continuar las negociaciones está fijada para el miércoles 18 de diciembre. La empresa ha ofrecido un convenio para cinco años e incrementos salariales, que según el comité son insuficientes.\n\"Un año de bonanza\"\nEl comité, a través de una nota de prensa, ha insistido en que \"el Grupo Nordex ha vivido un año de bonanza, no solo con los mejores resultados de Ebitda (189 millones, al cierre del tercer trimestre de 2024) y de ventas desde la fusión en 2016, sino el logro de beneficios netos, algo inaudito hasta la fecha\". Los sindicatos han recordado que \"solo dos años antes, el Ebitda fue de -244 millones de euros\".\nAdemás, han querido dejar claro que \"en Nordex Spain, los miembros de la dirección aumentaron su salario una media de un 74% en 2023, catapultando el salario medio de la plantilla a 55.000 euros, por encima del salario más alto de tablas -creciendo un 6,25% en un ejercicio en que no hubo incremento colectivo al estar vencido el convenio\".",
