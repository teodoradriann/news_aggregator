    "text": "NEW ORLEANS — Rare solar storms could impact technology in The United States and project the northern lights over unusual locations throughout the country Friday night, according to scientists. The flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections which shoot plasma and magnetic field from the outer atmosphere of the sun. This phenomenon is rare and has historically caused brief navigation issues and power grid problems. \"They label these things like they do hurricanes -- from one to five -- they're labeling this one a G4 Watch,\" WWL Louisiana Meteorologist Payton Malone said Friday. \"The last time they issued a G4 Watch was 2005.\" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said they had been monitoring the flares since Wednesday morning when at least five flares appeared to have been directed toward Earth. The NOAA outlined on Thursday the impact these storms can have. \"Geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth's surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\" NOAA said on Thursday. \"Geomagnetic storms can also trigger spectacular displays of aurora on Earth.\" Louisiana will likely not see the aurora borealis lights. Although the National Weather Service has said that half the United States might be able to see the northern lights, including possibly Alabama and northern California. In addition, almost all of Canada will be placed within view of the aurora. The 2003 Halloween Storms in Sweden were cited by NOAA as a recent example of a solar storm having an impact on Earth. During that cycle, most of Sweden had a one-hour-long power outage.",

    "text": "They also got him a bag of treats from a store in New Zealand and a card before surprising him with the gesture they had prepared for in secret. The coronavirus pandemic may have closed international borders, but it also united people in shared struggles. In 2021, a Maori man named [Jarom Ngakuru (@jaromngakuru)](https://www.tiktok.com/@jaromngakuru), who was working in the U.S., was devastated when he couldn’t attend his grandmother’s funeral in New Zealand. Seeing his grief, Ngakuru's American co-workers surprised him with a traditional Maori dance that moved him to tears, according to [Good Morning America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWmW01cM31g). Ngakuru, heartbroken at not being able to say goodbye to his grandmother, shared with Good Morning America: “It was my nan, my mum’s mum. She passed away. I grew up with her. She is a big influence on my life. She was my last grandparent alive on Earth.” He added that in New Zealand when someone passes away, they bury them in the ground “really, really quick.” His grandmother was buried within just two days of her passing. “By the time I would be able to fly back home, and make it from America, I was going to miss her funeral,” he said. View this post on Instagram He added that he couldn’t fly home even if he tried to, since New Zealand restricted people from flying in and out because of COVID. So, while he was struggling with utter grief, his co-workers came together to help him heal. “And they just said, ‘Hey we’re here,’” Jarom recalled, “We already know what’s happening. We got together a bunch of things for you.” He revealed that his friends got him a bag of treats from a little store in New Zealand, his hometown, along with a card that had a heartwarming message written on it. In addition to all that, they planned a thoughtful gesture by secretly learning the traditional Maori dance called “haka,” which is usually performed at significant events like weddings and funerals. The group was led by Jarom’s brother-in-law, Tongan, who also lives in America, and taught them the haka dance in just 24 hours. In May 2024, Jarom uploaded a short [TikTok clip](https://www.tiktok.com/@jaromngakuru/video/7372028383007411464) featuring their performance that brought tears to his eyes back in 2021. \"The hardest part about living in America is that we live so far away. I couldn't make it home for my nan's funeral and I was broken! So my boys at work learned the haka without me knowing and brought home to me,” he wrote in the caption of the video. The clip shows the group of men passionately performing the traditional dance while vigorously slapping their chests and yelling chants in powerful voices. The tribe Ngapuhi, to which Jarom belongs, has its own style of performing haka, Jarom told Good Morning America. Describing his feelings after watching his coworkers perform the traditional dance, Jarom added, “The emotion I felt was like love and passion. Like compassion towards them all.” [@jaromngakuru]Hardest part about living in america 🇺🇸 is that we live so far away. I couldnt make it home for my nans funeral and i was BROKEN! so my boys at work learned the haka without me knowing and brought home to me 🇳🇿🏠[#haka][#grateful][#maori][#newzealand][#brothers][#fyp][#foryou][♬ original sound - Jarom Ngakuru] The video resonated with viewers from New Zealand to Florida, prompting heartwarming comments. “Actually the best haka ove seen done by Americans,” commented [@kiwi_the_bro](https://www.tiktok.com/@kiwi_the_bro). While [@danisdailydose](https://www.tiktok.com/@danisdailydose) said, “This shows how loved you are over in the States by your workmates. the effort and time they put in to learn and bring home to you. So cool bro!” Speaking to Good Morning America, Jarom admitted, “I obviously felt alone, having nobody around me in my family. And I was like, kind of, in my own little bubble,” he said, “But they just showed support, and in a way that I was like, ‘Whoa, this is crazy!’ I never saw it coming, but it helped me relieve a lot of stress, knowing that I have family here, even when I can’t be there.”",

    "title": "FIRST ALERT: Ice and snow to impact early weekend travel",
    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Ice and snow to impact early weekend travel\nIcy roads and surfaces likely tonight through Saturday\nWe are tracking a winter storm system that will bring light snow, light freezing rain/drizzle and sleet to much of our region this evening through Saturday. Overall precipitation won’t be heavy but will be enough to create slippery roads and surfaces, creating hazardous travel conditions across much of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. Sleet and snow accumulation will generally be around or less than an inch with around a tenth of an inch or less of ice accumulation possible. A winter weather advisory is in effect for much of central and southern Minnesota and much of the state of Iowa from this evening through much of Saturday. If you must travel, be prepared for very icy roads. Stay tuned for updates. The KEYC First Alert Weather Team will be watching the system closely and will be here with local weather updates on the app, KEYC.com and on KEYC WeatherNow channel 12.4 as things develop.\nDETAILS BELOW:\nLatest Watches, Warnings and Advisories\nA winter storm system will move from the Rockies and across southern Iowa tonight into Saturday, bringing a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain/drizzle that will make travel difficult Friday night through much of Saturday. There isn’t a lot of moisture with this system. In fact, if all of the precipitation were to come in the form of snow, we’d be looking at around an inch, maybe up to 2 in a few spots. The challenge is warm air getting pulled into the middle layers of the atmosphere. This will make things a bit messy as we transition from sleet to snow to freezing rain and drizzle. A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for central and southern Minnesota and northern Iowa from Friday evening through much of Saturday. The advisory is along and south of a line from the northern Twin Cities metro to Marshall. In the Mankato/North Mankato area, the Winter Weather Advisory is in effect from 9pm Friday evening through noon Saturday. You can find times and information for your specific location on the KEYC First Alert Weather app and at KEYC.com when you click the weather alerts banner toward the top of the page.\nTIMING:\nAreas of sleet and snow will develop and move from southwest to northeast across our region this evening. In the Mankato/North Mankato area, areas of sleet and snow will arrive by mid to late evening. Arrival times will be earlier southwest of Mankato and a bit later to the north and east. Areas of light snow and freezing drizzle will continue through late tonight with light snow and freezing rain and/or drizzle likely from late tonight through much of the day Saturday.\nPRECIPITATION AMOUNTS:\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is not a high-precipitation winter weather event. We’re only expecting around one to two tenths of an inch of moisture, which will likely end up being around an inch or less of sleet and snow with less than a tenth of an inch of ice. Ice amounts could be slightly higher further south where it is warmer. Snow and sleet amounts could be slightly higher with ice amounts being lower further north where it is colder.\nIMPACT:\nRoads and sidewalks will become icy and very slippery by mid to late Friday evening with icy conditions and hazardous travel conditions continuing through at least midday Saturday. Travel conditions will gradually improve Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening.\nEXTENDED FORECAST:\nSunday will be mostly cloudy but warmer with highs in the mid to upper 30s. We are watching another system that will have the potential to bring some light rain and snow on Monday afternoon into Monday night. After that, colder Canadian air will move into the region, keeping temperatures in the low to mid 20s through most of next week. Unfortunately, the chance of a white Christmas—beyond what we have now—isn’t looking great. But there is still hope. Christmas is still over 10 days away, and a lot can happen between now and then.\n[Click here to download the KEYC News Now app or our KEYC First Alert weather app.](https://www.keyc.com/page/keyc-apps-for-ios-and-android-devices/)\nCopyright 2024 KEYC.
