    "text": "[Long Island](/long-island) [Nassau](/long-island/nassau)\nGay Marina Regina Catholic School teacher says Diocese of Rockville Centre fired him for pictures showing him kissing boyfriend\nA third grade teacher at Maria Regina Catholic School in Seaford said he was fired after officials with the Diocese of Rockville Centre were alerted to pictures on social media of him kissing his longtime boyfriend.\nMichael Califano, whose father was a Nassau County police officer who died in the line of duty more than a decade ago, said he was called into a meeting Wednesday with the school's pastor and the head of human resources for the diocese, who told him that he was not following a “Catholic lifestyle and Catholic ethics” based on the church handbook and that his employment had been terminated.\nCalifano, 26, who attended the school as a child, worked at Maria Regina for two years.\n“They said that I wasn't living a Catholic lifestyle but didn't specify what they viewed as a Catholic lifestyle,” Califano, who is gay, told Newsday. “I go to church every Sunday. I'm very active in my parish because my parish is my school. So from what I've seen, and from clearly from what other people have seen, I have been living a Catholic lifestyle. The diocese feels that they can decide differently.”\nThe diocese on Thursday refused to answer questions about Califano's termination.\n“For privacy reasons we do not comment publicly on personnel matters, but we can say that the school did not end Mr. Califano’ s employment over his sexuality,” said Sean Dolan, a diocesan spokesman.\nCalifano and other parents familiar with the termination insist the school and its pastor fought against the firing but were overruled by Rev. John O. Barres, the bishop of the diocese.\nA rally in support of Califano is planned for Friday in front of the Cathedral of St. Agnes in Rockville Centre.\nIn a letter to parents Thursday, Maria Regina pastor Rev. Jason Grisafi and principal Matthew Scannapieco confirmed Califano's termination.\n“We understand that a change in teaching staff during the school year is significant and want to assure you that this decision was made after thorough and careful consideration and review,” they wrote. “Due to the confidential nature of personnel matters, we are not permitted to provide any further details about this decision.”\nThe statement said the school is “working to ensure that when our students return that they are returning to what so many love about our school — a safe and nurturing environment where they can learn and be formed in their Catholic faith.”\nCalifano said the school and the diocese were aware of his sexuality and never expressed concern until an individual sent an anonymous letter to Bishop Barres with pictures from Califano's boyfriend's Facebook page showing the two men kissing. Califano said his Facebook page is private and that he never discusses his sexuality in the classroom.\n“They said they found things on that account that were inappropriate for a Catholic schoolteacher,” said Califano, who has been in contact with an attorney. “There's nothing vulgar on that account.”\nParents at Maria Regina expressed outrage about Califano's termination, creating a Facebook page in support of the teacher and an online petition urging the diocese to reverse its position that had more than 1,000 signatures by Thursday evening. Some parents said they're planning to pull their children from the school in protest or to refuse Sunday donations to the church.\nToni Lichtenberger of Massapequa said Califano taught her daughter last year and called him an “amazing teacher and an amazing person” who is beloved in the school.\n“This is a witch hunt,” she said. “We pay tuition because we want a certain type of education that aligns with our family's values and morals. What they just did goes against everything they're supposed to be learning. These kids are supposed to be learning acceptance and tolerance. And this has gone the complete opposite way.”\nCalifano's father, a highway patrolman of the same name, died in 2011 after his patrol car was struck by a flatbed tow truck on the Long Island Expressway during a traffic stop. The driver, who prosecutors said fell asleep behind the wheel,\npleaded guilty to reckless driving and avoided jail time.\nUpdated 40 minutes ago Dog stabbed 17 times ...

    "text": "Lexington nonprofit asking for donations in honor of Human Trafficking Prevention Month LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Natalie’s Sisters in Lexington is dedicated to serving those who have been sexually exploited or trafficked. In honor of January being Human Trafficking Prevention Month, the center is calling on the community to help them continue their mission. Natalie’s Sisters serves 175 people per week, a demographic many people may be unaware exists in the Lexington area. “Its a great time for folks to be aware of what’s going on in Lexington and to try to erase the stigma that goes with it, and try to get folks involved, because there’s lots of things. Everybody can do something to help,” said Natalie’s Sisters Executive Director Jani Lewis. The nonprofit said they are in need of an array of donations. “We need everything from greeting cards for the ladies, encouragement cards, to sack lunches, breakfasts, and then all the items we give away to help their immediate needs,” Lewis said. Lewis added the donations they receive are used all year round. “In January, we have a full calendar open now for breakfast and lunch, and we struggle a bit toward the first of the year, then the middle of the year for summer, to fill those slots to make sure we have healthy food for the ladies,” she said. Thanksgiving and Christmas can bring a lot of support for the organization, but they are hoping to extend the season of giving into the new year. “We’re hoping to carry on with the momentum from the holidays and remind people that not only for us, but for all the social service organizations in Lexington. We all need help all year round,” said Lewis. Lewis added the best way for people to donate is to visit the [organization’s website ](https://www.nataliessisters.org/current-needs)to see a list of items they need. She said donors must email melinda@nataliessisters.org to set up a donation drop-off time. Copyright 2023 WKYT. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "From Moscow, Modi travelled to Austria, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country in 41 years. (DD News/Screengrab) Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned home on Thursday morning after concluding his visit to Russia and Austria, during which he held talks with the top leadership of the two countries and discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation. Modi first travelled to Russia, where he participated in the 22nd India-Russia summit with President Vladimir Putin, in his first trip to Moscow since the Ukraine conflict. “PM @narendramodi emplanes for New Delhi after concluding a successful visit to Austria,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a post on X after wrapping up the two-nation trip. During his visit, he told Russian President Putin that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield, and peace talks do not succeed amidst bombs, guns and bullets. The prime minister was on Tuesday officially conferred the ’Order of St Andrew the Apostle’ award by President Putin for his contribution to fostering bilateral ties between the two countries. The award was announced in 2019. From Moscow, Modi travelled to Austria, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country in 41 years. During his visit, Modi met Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen and Chancellor Karl Nehammer and discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation in several sectors, including the environment and combating climate change. He also discussed the ongoing disputes in the world, including the Ukraine conflict and the situation in West Asia, with the two leaders. “My visit to Austria has been historic and immensely productive. New vigour has been added to the friendship between our nations. I am glad to have attended diverse programmes while in Vienna. Gratitude to Chancellor @karlnehammer, the Austrian Government and people for their hospitality and affection,” the prime minister said in a post on X. Modi also addressed the Indian community in both countries during his visit. (With PTI inputs)",
