Il presidente della Cei non lascia spazio alle interpretazioni e attacca la \"madre di tutte le riforme\" fortemente voluta dalla presidente del Consiglio. Il cardinale Matteo Zuppi precisa - e lo riporta Repubblica - che un giudizio allarmato sarebbe prematuro, \"mi sembra che la discussione sia ancora aperta\", ma non nasconde che nel corso dell’assemblea di primavera che si è svolto questa settimana in Vaticano \"qualche vescovo\" ha espresso \"preoccupazioni\" per la riforma del premierato. \"Personalmente — aggiunge il presidente della Cei — penso che gli equilibri istituzionali vadano toccati con molta attenzione: se togli qualche pezzo devi essere molto equilibrato\".

L’occasione: la cerimonia ad Asti per il trentennale della morte di Giovanni Goria, presidente del Consiglio dc nel 1987-88, scomparso a soli 51 anni. Goria offre molte lezioni per l’oggi. Sulla fatica della democrazia, anzitutto. \"Non si esaurisce in un giorno, in un gesto, in un atto, ma per vivere necessita sempre della partecipazione dei cittadini. Di qui il suo rispetto per i percorsi costituzionali e, di conseguenza, l’impegno a rafforzare il ruolo del Parlamento sulle scelte di fondo\".",

    "text": "Advertisement\nIs Skin Care TikTok Gen Z's New Magnified Mirror?\nBy Hannah Frye\ncommerce guidelines.Our selections are never influenced by the commissions earned from our links.\nNo matter what you're into, there's probably a TikTok community that shares your interest. From \"vegan cooking TikTok\" to \"beginner's knitting TikTok\" and beyond, there's arguably something for everyone on the app.\n\"Skin care TikTok\" (also referred to as \"SkinTok\" for short) is undoubtedly one of the most popular, especially for teens and twentysomethings. This niche includes single-product reviews, before-and-after photos with acne transformations, lengthy skin care routines, no-makeup shots, and so on.\nWhile cathartic \"get ready with me\" videos likely aren't doing much harm, there may be a downside to filling your feed with skin-focused content. Below, our investigation.\nWhy do people love skin care videos?\nYou could say SkinTok is the \"magnified mirror\" for Gen Z—causing people to hyperfixate on their skin for hours, wreaking havoc on their mental health and their complexion as a result. While this isn't the goal, it is a very real and very possible effect.\nSkinTok encompasses a wide range of videos. For the most part, the intention behind these clips is wholesome. Some creators like Allison (@iskillingyou on TikTok) openly share their skin struggles, helping their audience who relates to their journey feel less alone.\nOthers, like influencer and founder of Krave Beauty Liah Yoo (@liahyoo on TikTok), open up about their acne journey, sharing what helped them clear their skin and gain confidence.\n\"On YouTube, I used to share my acne skin care journey pretty vulnerably, which allowed me to personally connect with my audience who's going through the same journey,\" Yoo notes. \"I think this makes an online personality more human and can foster a deeper relationship with their own community, as they have a common struggle they can openly share and connect with.\" That being said, SkinTok is not all bad all the time.\nThen you have product reviews and recommendations: These can certainly be helpful, too, but not so much when they're targeting an audience already fixating on their skin concerns. These often lack context, so users may be swayed to purchase a product that actually doesn't suit their skin type.\nTo that end, some trends on SkinTok just aren't beneficial in any respect. Yoo notes the \"clean girl aesthetic\" (and similar microtrends) as some of the more triggering videos on SkinTok. \"It has more to do with how you look [and it's] not inclusive at all,\" she says. \"It definitely fosters insecurity for those who aren't born with the way these girls look naturally.\"\nIs the algorithm working against you?\nIf you're not familiar with TikTok, here's a simple explanation of how the algorithm works: The more you engage with a video, the more similar content you'll get. So if you like or comment on a skin care video, TikTok takes that as a sign that you enjoy those videos and, theoretically, would like to see more.\nFor some niche TikTok communities, this can be harmless (what's wrong with more recipes to try out, right?). However, the situation looks quite different for anyone already searching for answers, be it about clearing acne, optimizing gut health, balancing hormones, etc., because the mass amount of content provides countless solutions—none of which are guaranteed to work for you. But still, all of these might convince you that you need to act in a certain way or buy a certain product.\nSeeing more and similar content, in this case, is not better. Consider every time you log on to TikTok and all you see is the best products for clearing acne, the one trick that erases wrinkles for good, how to smooth your skin texture in two days‚ and so on. Regardless of the social media platform you use, this rabbit hole can become overwhelming and addicting.\nWhat's more, \"Skin requires time and patience to heal, so it's actually the worst type of thing to pair with the 24/7, instant gratification style of content we get on social media,\" psychologist Chloe Carmichael, Ph.D., tells mbg.\nHyperfixating on your skin isn't going to help you\nNo matter what skin concern you're dealing with, obsessing over your skin won't help. In fact, going on SkinTok every day can spark \"skin anxiety\" from scratch.\nAs content creator Natalie O'Neill (@natalie_oneillll on TikTok) explains in [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@natalie_oneillll/video/7191149416693206278), \"skin anxiety\" could manifest in many ways, from constantly looking at your skin in the mirror, regularly canceling plans because of a breakout, thinking about your skin several times throughout the day, or avoiding certain foods you love for fear they'll trigger a breakout.\nWhat's more, \"We tend to go on our phones when we're feeling [insecure](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/why-am-i-so-insecure) or already unfocused on the present moment,\" Carmichael says. Being hit with a reminder of your insecurities via SkinTok isn't going to help—especially if those videos include products you can buy with a few clicks. (It provides the illusion of a quick fix when it's really anything but.)\n\"We're more open to being manipulated when we're insecure,\" Carmichael says about skin care marketing. And while there's no guarantee the product won't work for you, there's definitely no promise it will.\n\"It can become dangerous when recommending things because skin care is not linear; it is personal to your skin,\" esthetician at Heyday [Nikki Sussman](https://www.heydayskincare.com/) tells mbg. Compounding the questionable fit in your routine, testing out new products every week can overwhelm your skin, leading to [more irritation](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/soothe-irritated-skin) and potentially more breakouts, redness, etc.\nIn turn, the new breakouts can cause more stress ([and thus more breakouts](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/stress-acne)), contributing to the negative feedback loop that started with simply scrolling your For You Page.\nHow to deal\nIf the above situation sounds familiar, follow these expert-led tips below:\nTake a break\nThe first step: Get off TikTok, at least for a while. Experts will tell you to put down the magnified mirror if you'd like to stop picking at your pores, and the same goes for social media habits. Instead of spending hours scrolling through your feed, practice activities you enjoy that have nothing to do with your skin.\nChange your algorithm\nAfter your break, take control of the content you consume by changing your algorithm. When you see a video that makes you feel insecure, press the \"not interested\" button (on TikTok, that's the broken heart graphic on it). Then the app will know to give you fewer of those videos in the future.\nTo speed up the process, interact with videos that make you feel happy or teach you something. Explore different topics that spark your interest outside of your skin and appearance and seek out that content via the search feature.\nTo be clear, this doesn't mean you should abandon your journey to learn more about your skin and take care of it—just do so in a mindful, intentional, and tailored manner.\nSee an expert if you can\n\"Consult both a dermatologist and an esthetician—having a holistic understanding of why these things are happening and coming up with a solution is the only way it will go away,\" Sussman notes about chronic breakouts.\nIf you don't have access to a dermatologist or esthetician, then limit the skin advice you consume on TikTok to those licensed or board-certified in the field of skin care rather than influencers alone.\n[Skin anxiety](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/acne-can-be-trauma-too-research-and-experts-agree) can be a difficult mindset to escape, but you may be able to limit the recurring thoughts if you spend a few minutes in the morning or evening checking in with your skin. You can do this during your [skin care routine](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-create-nighttime-skin-care-routine-best-products) and tell yourself throughout the day to wait until that allotted time to check in—giving yourself a few moments back in your day for other thoughts.\nStill, those with [cystic acne](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/blind-pimples-how-to-get-rid-of-cystic-acne) or general anxiety may find it more difficult to escape the negativity spiral and should visit a therapist if possible. These experts can help you build a plan to get your mind off of your skin; remember that just like skin care, mental health is not one-size-fits-all.\nThe takeaway\nWhile SkinTok is not all bad, it can become toxic when it takes up your entire feed and causes you to hyperfixate on your skin. To ensure you break this pattern sooner rather than later, take a break from TikTok and engage with other content that sparks joy, not anxiety. Try receiving skin care info from more nuanced sources (that often contain way more context than a 60-second video). That said, if you have breakouts on your mind and you're not sure where to start, [refer to this guide for derm-backed tips](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/beauty-breakdown-acne).\n[more Lifestyle](/lifestyle)",

    "text": "‘We’ve had a week’: Warm temps, lack of snow impacting skiing in Anchorage, mushing in Western Alaska\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - While some may have enjoyed the recent warm weather that has taken over much of the state, the temperatures and precipitation have greatly affected outdoor enthusiasts who use the variety of pristine trails offered in Alaska.\nWhile the first prep ski race of the season was held at Service High School last weekend, much of the hillside trails are unskiable as of this week.\n“The temperature was sustained higher, [with] higher winds up there and rain, so those trails have been reduced — a lot of ground is showing, a lot of ice, so it is not really skiable up there at the moment,” Kikkan Randall, Olympian and Executive Director of the Nordic Ski Association of Anchorage said.\nMeanwhile, one of the few skiable places in the Anchorage area is the world-class trails at Kincaid Park, but that is only because of snowfall at the beginning of the season and the snow-making machines that churned out additional — albeit artificial — snow last month.\n“The conditions are hanging in there for the moment,” Randall, the 2018 Winter Olympics gold medalist, said. “We have this big snow gun behind me, we did a lot of snowmaking work back in November when we had colder temperatures, and that is turning out to be our saving grace here, because anywhere we have the snowmaking depth, the snow is there.\nOther places ... are getting really thin, a lot of water coming up, so the best skiing in town is [at Kincaid], other trails in town have not faired so well.”\nA high school ski race scheduled for Saturday at the Beach Lake Trails in Chugiak has been moved to Kincaid as of Thursday. Kincaid is also set to host the [U.S. Cross-Country Ski Championships](https://usnationalsanchorage2025.com/) Jan. 2-7, 2025.\nIn Western Alaska, the active mushing community has had a delayed start to their season. [Kuskokwim 300](https://www.k300.org/) Executive Director Paul Basile said while the temperatures have been ideal this week, the previous combination of warm weather, lack of snow and high winds have exposed grass and left little to no trails suitable for mushing.\n“They’re struggling,” Basile said about teams trying to get in valuable training. “In talking with a few recently, there have been extended stretches where they are not able to train at all, or in very limited fashion. Then we get a bit of snow and they’re out on the trailing getting into a groove finally, then it’s 40 degrees again for a few days.”\nThe Kuskokwim 300 Race Committee hosts seven races annually in the area. The first race of the Delta Championship Series had to be postponed with no rescheduled date in sight yet.\n“Just a lot of patience and flexibility right now,” Basile said. “That’s really all we can do.”\nSee a spelling or grammar error?

    "text": "Canadian farmers produced less wheat, canola, barley and oats in 2023 due to lower yields in Western Canada where growing conditions were generally drier than in 2022, the production of principal field crops for November 2023 from Statistics Canada said. “Throughout the growing season in 2023, dry conditions across much of Western Canada contributed to lower yields compared with 2022. Warm and dry conditions allowed farm operators to complete harvests in a timely manner across most of the prairies,” a news release on the report said. Canadian wheat production fell by 6.9 per cent to 32 million tonnes with lower yields offsetting the higher harvested area, the report said. In Alberta, wheat yields decreased by 19.6 per cent to 44.7 bushels per acre due to dry conditions in parts of the province. Harvested area rose by 2.4 per cent to 7.7 million acres, resulting in a 17.8 per cent decrease in wheat production to 9.3 million tonnes. Nationally canola production decreased by two per cent to 18.3 million tonnes driven by lower yields. Harvested area rose three per cent to 21.9 million acres. The report noted in Alberta, canola production fell 3.5 per cent to 5.4 million tonnes. The decrease was attributable to lower harvested area while yields edged down 0.5 per cent to 37.9 bushels per acre. Canadian barley production fell 10.9 per cent to 8.9 million tonnes. Total oat production decreased by 49.6 per cent nationally to 2.6 million tonnes in 2023 — the lowest production in more than a decade.",

Women need to think carefully about opting for the implants, said plastic surgeons Rita Kappel and pathologist Evert van den Broek.\nThey have conducted and then published their research in the British Journal of Cancer Research. They concluded that silicone breast prostheses can begin shedding particles almost immediately after placement.\nUp to now, it was only assumed that older breast implants, which have been in the body for years, show leaks like this or “Sweat.” Affected women then report chronic fatigue, for example. According to Kappel, replacing old implants with new ones is, therefore, not a solution. According to her, sweating continues with the new ones, and the effects add up.\nThe scientists looked at tissue from seven women who reported no symptoms but were unhappy with their breast enlargement between 2018 and 2021. They wanted to get rid of the implants.\nThe scientists saw that silicone molecules can occur in the surrounding connective tissue capsule and spread further within three weeks after placement. \"This capsule, a natural reaction of the body, forms as a kind of covering layer around the prosthesis,\" they explained.\nThey advocate further research. \"Think before you leap,\" they tell candidates for implants in the meantime. \"The best thing is no implant at all,\" said Kappel.\nReporting by ANP",

    "text": "Bethesda Game Studios has announced a “next-gen update” is coming to Fallout 4 on April 25th. The free update is coming to both console and PC. On PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, players will get Performance mode and Quality mode settings to offer up to 60fps gameplay and improved resolution. Bethesda is also promising various “stability improvements” and “fixes” on current-gen consoles as well as PS4 and Xbox One. PC players, meanwhile, will receive widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, fixes to Creation Kit and “a variety of quest updates.” Fallout 4 will also launch on the Epic Games Store while receiving Steam Deck verification on Steam. Oddly, the official Bethesda blog post doesn’t mention it, but the update is clearly coming to coincide with the new Fallout TV series. Created by Westworld‘s Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the series premiered on April 11th on Prime Video to significant acclaim. A second season is also in the works.
