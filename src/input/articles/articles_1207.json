    "title": "Tinubu pledges to end reign of terror in South East — Shettima",
    "text": "Vice President Kashim Shettima, on Friday, pledged the commitment of President Bola Tinubu’s administration to end the reign of terror in the South East. Shettima stated this at the unveiling of the Peace in South East Project (PISE-P) by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Benjamin Kalu, in Bende Local Government Area (LGA) of Abia. He condemned those he described as self-serving criminals and certain persons taking advantage of the security situation to foster their dangerous political agenda in the region. Shettima said Tinubu had been worried about the economic devastation inflicted on the South East geopolitical zone by non-state actors since he assumed office. He also assured that Tinubu was determined to deploy all available resources to eliminate the purveyors of falsehoods and propaganda that have become weapons against Nigeria’s unity. In his speech, titled, “Why We are all Umunna”, Shettima said Tinubu is concerned about the extensive economic devastation inflicted by non-state actors on this beautiful region since we took office. “Tinubu is acutely aware that our commitment to Nigeria’s future remains incomplete as long as we grapple with the sinister operations of economic saboteurs who masquerade as advocates for the Ndi-Igbo. “That’s why he’s determined to utilise all available resources to ensure that the peace we’re establishing in this region is not cosmetic. “And we can’t guarantee it unless all of us see through the falsehoods and propaganda that have become weapons against our unity.” Shettima noted that the gory activities of the criminals holding the South East captive are self-serving and do not in any way represent the interests of Ndi-Igbo and the entire country. He said the terror groups that have held the south east to ransom are not a creation of the people of the region, or of Nigerians from other parts of the country. “The problem we are here to solve as a community, as an Umunna, is a creation of self-serving criminals who do not represent the interests of the Ndi-Igbo and Nigerians. “Mr President knows this better than all of us, and that’s why he has never held any group accountable for the infractions of law-breaking individuals who identify as their members. ” This, I believe, is the democracy we have all chosen,” he stated. He pointed out that the criminals disrupting the peace in the south east are doing so in connivance with “forces exploiting the situation for dangerous political agenda.” The Vice President said attempts to undo the hard work of the nation’s heroes past would fail. He, however, said that the catastrophic situation can’t be reversed unless the government involves the people whom he said are the ears, legs and mouths in the region. “Today, we stand united to firmly declare: enough is enough,” VP Shettima stated. He stressed the need for a coordinated intervention to tackle insecurity in the region head-on. Shettima assured the south east people that the Tinubu administration “shall not rest until it fulfills its pledge to mitigate the crisis it inherited.” The vice president noted that no better visionary could save the nation from implosion than President Tinubu. He said the development agenda of the Federal Government in the south east would continue to elude the region if the intricate web of security challenges the Tinubu-led federal government inherited is not contained. “The seeds of progress can only sprout in the fertile soil of peace and security. “This is why we take immense pride in the collaboration of all stakeholders and initiatives such as the Peace in south east project. “This will ensure that the shield of security in the region isn’t a distant mirage in the landscape of aspirations.” He commended the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and convener of the peace initiative, Kalu, for his efforts to restore lasting peace in the region. He said the event attests “to the profound understanding that no one comprehends the experience of a community better than the people themselves.” Earlier, Kalu said that his goal for initiating the Peace In South East Project (PISE-P) was to foster peace, unity, and development in the region. He said the project also aims at promoting reconciliation among communities and individuals affected by past conflicts. “When I embarked on the South East Project, my vision was clear — to foster peace, unity, and development in our region through a non-kinetic approach. “The south east has long been known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant communities, and enterprising people. Yet, we have faced our fair share of challenges, including socioeconomic disparities, insecurities, political tensions, and occasional conflicts. “Our goals in the south east project are clear. We aim to promote reconciliation among communities and individuals affected by past conflicts. “We recognise the need to address the root causes of conflict, including socio-economic disparities and political tensions. “Empowering communities is another crucial goal of the project, providing them with the necessary resources, skills, and opportunities for sustainable development.” (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) READ ALSO FROM [NIGERIAN TRIBUNE](http://www.tribuneonlineng.com)",

    "title": "Martin County Sheriff's Office deputies make largest fentanyl seizure in county's history",
    "text": "Martin County Sheriff's Office makes largest fentanyl seizure in county's history The Martin County Sheriff’s Office says deputies just made the largest seizure of fentanyl ever after finding 2.5 pounds of the deadly drug during a bust on Wednesday. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office says a confidential informant told detectives three men from New York were traveling to Stuart to bring $300,000 worth of fentanyl to the Treasure Coast. In exchange, they were set to receive $38,000. Detectives arrested all three of those men and seized 2.5 pounds of fentanyl, which is a Martin County record for a single drug bust. \"I don’t really think that narco-traffickers in New York are listening to me right now, but I can tell this to my community who depends on me to keep this poison out of the schools and away from their homes- not in my small town,” said Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. The arrests happened after noon on Wednesday outside the Walmart on Federal Highway in Stuart. Deputies say Jeffry Ezequil Gonzalez-Ortiz tried to run when deputies surrounded the suspects, but he was caught. Carlos Antonio Almonte-Melo and Yelson Daniel Alvarez-Ortiz were arrested without incident. Deputies say the three men are from the Bronx and tried to transport the fentanyl to Stuart, but criminal informants wearing recording devices worked with law enforcement to help detectives gather evidence, which led to the arrests. The fentanyl was made into 10,000 pressed pills that looked like oxycontin. \"When I walked up to that car and saw that bag containing what turned out to be 2.5 pounds, I was absolutely flabbergasted,\" Snyder said. \"We’re used to five pills, six pills, seven pills. 10,000? That’s unheard of and dangerous, extremely dangerous.\" The sheriff says this bust highlights the problem of fentanyl flooding South Florida streets. The department reports there were 51 fentanyl-related overdoses and 26 deaths last year in Martin County and there have been 49 fentanyl-related overdoses and 19 deaths in Martin County this year, though this year's numbers could rise based on toxicology results in open investigations. The sheriff says Wednesday’s arrests were a step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done. \"This is a battle that we won, but this is a war that we are continuing to wage and there is no end in sight,” Snyder said. “We’re working with other agencies and partners in this endeavor. We do think this is a major trafficking organization with tentacles throughout South Florida, so we are just one county in a multitude of counties where this narcotics is being trafficked.\" The sheriff says each of the three men arrested face at least 25 years in prison. Right now, they each have a $200,000 bond.",

    "title": "New NailaoLocker Ransomware Attacking European Healthcare",
    "text": "European healthcare organizations are facing a sophisticated cyber threat from a newly identified ransomware strain called NailaoLocker, deployed as part of a campaign tracked as Green Nailao by Orange Cyberdefense CERT.\nThe attacks, first detected between June and October 2024, exploit vulnerabilities in Check Point VPN appliances and leverage advanced backdoors like ShadowPad and PlugX to infiltrate networks.\nThe campaign combines cyberespionage tools with ransomware payloads.\nWhile researchers at Orange Cyberdefense detected that this combination create a hybrid threat which threaten both data security and operational continuity in critical healthcare infrastructure.\nTechnical Mechanism and Attack Workflow The Green Nailao campaign begins with attackers exploiting CVE-2024-24919, a critical vulnerability in Check Point Security Gateways enabling unauthorized access to VPN credentials.\nOnce inside, threat actors conduct lateral movement via RDP and deploy a three-stage execution chain involving legitimate binaries, malicious DLLs, and encrypted payloads.\nA key component is the NailaoLoader, a DLL sideloaded via legitimate executables like usysdiag.exe (signed by Beijing Huorong Network Technology).\nThe loader decrypts the ransomware payload ( usysdiag.exe.dat ) using a custom algorithm:-\ndecrypted_byte = ((encrypted_byte + 0x4B) ^ 0x3F) - 0x4B\nThis routine, observed across multiple samples, removes the .dat file after decryption to hinder forensic analysis.\nThe decrypted NailaoLocker executable then creates a mutex ( Global\\lockv7 ) to ensure singular execution and begins encrypting files using AES-256-CTR, appending the .locked extension.\nNailaoLocker Execution Flow (Source – Orange Cyberdefense) Unlike sophisticated ransomware strains, NailaoLocker exhibits operational shortcomings: it ignores network shares, fails to terminate processes locking files, and leaves diagnostic logs in %ALLUSERPROFILE%\\unlock_please_view_this_file_ .\nThese logs inadvertently aid incident responders in identifying encryption failures.\nThe ransomware drops a ransom note directing victims to contact a ProtonMail address and demands payment in Bitcoin.\nRansom note example left by NailaoLocker (Source – Orange Cyberdefense) Infrastructure analysis reveals spoofed TLS certificates mimicking Intel and Dell, with C2 servers hosted on VULTR. Notably, the campaign uses compromised IoT devices in Sweden and Proton VPN exit nodes for anonymization.\nThe Green Nailao campaign bears hallmarks of Chinese cyberespionage groups, particularly through its use of ShadowPad, a backdoor predominantly linked to China-nexus APTs.\nForensic overlaps with clusters like BRONZE UNIVERSITY and Cluster Alpha (noted by Sophos in 2023) further reinforce this attribution. However, the addition of ransomware introduces atypical objectives.\nAnalysts hypothesize the ransomware may serve dual purposes: masking data exfiltration or funding broader espionage activities. Notably, the attackers accessed Active Directory’s ntds.dit database, suggesting intent to harvest credentials for future operations.\nThis aligns with historical patterns of Chinese APTs targeting healthcare sectors for geopolitical intelligence.\nOrganizations are urged to patch Check Point appliances immediately and monitor for DLL sideloading patterns.\nOrange Cyberdefense recommends implementing behavioral detection for AES-256-CTR encryption processes and blocking TLS certificates mismatching legitimate corporate issuers.\nFor healthcare entities, enforcing Zero Trust architectures and segmenting critical systems remain vital to mitigating cascading impacts.\nFree Webinar: Better SOC with Interactive Malware Sandbox for Incident Response and Threat Hunting – Register Here",

    "text": "La DANA que ha golpeado en los últimos días todo el litoral mediterráneo español sigue activa y en las últimas horas se ha situado en el mar al norte de la isla. Aemet ha elevado la alerta amarilla a naranja porque se prevén episodios de alrededor de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora. El riesgo naranja permanecerá activo hasta las 20 horas de este viernes día festivo de Tots Sants. Las lluvias han descargado con fuerza en algunos puntos de la isla desde primera hora de la mañana, ya que la tormenta ha barrido buena parte de la isla. Sobre todo en la zona norte, con chubascos potentes en la zona de Sant Vicent, Sant Joan y entre Santa Agnès y Sant Mateu. Pero también se han producido lluvias intensas en otros puntos, como el Pla de Sant Antoni, en Santa Eulària hacia el interior e incluso en puntos aislados de Sant Josep y en la ciudad de Eivissa, donde se han producido algunas inundaciones. También en las últimas horas se han producido tormentas en Formentera. Se recomienda no estar en zonas inundables ni utilizar las carreteras, ya que es un fenómeno impredecible que puede descargar tormentas y provocar inundaciones en pocos minutos. Desde las 9 de la mañana también han descargado decenas de rayos en diferentes puntos de la isla. Aunque el grueso de la DANA sigue afectando desde anoche principalmente a la zona de Castellón y el Sur de Tarragona, se ha ido desplazando hacia el Mediterráneo y un frente está situado durante toda la madrugada y la mañana entre Ibiza y Mallorca. Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Ibiza, Formentera, Mallorca y Menorca.",

    "text": "La vuelta de las tensiones entre Venezuela y Guyana supone “enormes peligros” para la región, debido a la llegada de un buque de guerra británico a las costas guyanesas, a lo que el régimen de Nicolás Maduro respondió con una “acción defensiva” de la Fuerza Armada, advirtió este jueves la ONG Control Ciudadano.\nLa directora de la organización no gubernamental, Rocío San Miguel, se refirió a las declaraciones que diera este jueves el líder chavista Nicolás Maduro, en las que habló de una “ruptura” de lo pactado, por parte de su par guyanés, Irfaan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre, cuando acordaron no amenazarse mutuamente y evitar incidentes.\n“Considera Venezuela que está rota la declaración de Argyle (…) eso encierra enormes peligros para la paz y la estabilidad de la región”, dijo a EFE San Miguel, quien cree que los ejercicios militares ordenados por Maduro, en respuesta a la “amenaza” de Reino Unido, empezaron hoy y durarán hasta que el HMS Trent de la Armada británica se vaya de las costas guyanesas.\nSin embargo, el Gobierno guyanés afirmó que está comprometido con lo acordado con Maduro, y que la llegada del buque es “una rutina” y algo “planificado desde hace mucho tiempo, que forma parte de la construcción de la capacidad defensiva de Guyana”.\nSegún la analista, con el despliegue militar -que incluye 5.682 “combatientes”, 28 aeronaves y 16 embarcaciones, entre otras maquinarias-, Venezuela “está mostrando sus dientes” y exhibiendo su capacidad operativa, así como su “disposición de patrullaje y de vigilancia”.\nLos ejercicios, que se llevan a cabo en el estado Sucre (noreste), a cientos de kilómetros de Guyana, son la respuesta de Venezuela ante la negativa de Georgetown de impedir la llegada del buque británico.\nSan Miguel cree que, como no se conoce cuánto durarán las maniobras venezolanas, estas pudieran coincidir con ejercicios del lado guyanés a principios de enero, lo que configuraría “un escenario de claras tensiones militares de carácter regional”.\nLa disputa territorial escaló luego de que Venezuela aprobara el 3 de diciembre, en un referendo unilateral, anexionarse la zona bajo pleito, un área de casi 160.000 kilómetros cuadrados que está bajo control de Guyana y cuya controversia está en manos de la Corte Internacional de Justicia.\nCon información de EFE",

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",
