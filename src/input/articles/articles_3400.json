    "title": "\"A Camera for Christ\": How Steve Cooper is turning media into ministry",
    "text": "VICKSBURG, Miss. ( VDN ) — Steve Cooper, a Vicksburg native, has turned his passion for faith and media into a purpose-driven career—one rooted in service, creativity, and a deep commitment to God. Cooper currently serves as the Production Director at Brown Missionary Baptist Church in Southaven, Mississippi, but his journey to that role was one of faith, hard work, and divine direction.\nCooper says his spiritual foundation was laid early by his parents, who instilled Christian values in him. He officially gave his life to Christ at the age of 10.\nWhile attending Belhaven University, Cooper majored in sports broadcasting and minored in political science. During his senior year, he interned at Broadmoor Baptist Church, working under Michael Bowen and Chris Clatterbuck. There, he was able to cut his teeth in live production and video editing, experiences that set the tone for his future in ministry media.\nHis next calling took him across the country to Las Vegas, where he became the Media & Youth Director at Champion Center of Las Vegas. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cooper helped expand the church to two campuses while building a thriving media team.\n“We were actually meeting inside of a school on the Eastside of Vegas,” said Cooper. “But we were able to reach so many unsaved people looking for Christ.”\nOne of his most powerful memories from Las Vegas was a mass baptism held at a YMCA, where 25 young people ages 8 to 18 gave their lives to Christ.\n“It was just amazing to see us keep the full message of Jesus Christ while being in what most people refer to as Sin City,” he said.\nAfter his time in Las Vegas, Cooper returned to Mississippi to join Brown Missionary Baptist Church under Pastor Bartholomew Orr. For the past three years, he has led the church’s production team, overseeing live production, photography, video content, and A/V teams. He has also consulted other ministries across the nation to equip their teams to share the gospel through media. Brown’s online services now reach up to 4,000 live viewers on weekends, with more than 10,000 additional replays throughout the week.\n“At Brown, we’ve seen firsthand how Digital Discipleship is transforming lives—not just in our local community, but across the globe,” Cooper said. “God has no limits to the platforms He can use to reach people for Him.”\nPastor Orr echoed Cooper’s impact.\n“At Brown, we believe God can use any tool to reach people, and Steve has helped us use media and technology to do just that,” said Orr. “Because of him and our Production Team, more people are hearing the Gospel and growing in their faith—even if they’ve never walked through our doors.”\nNow, Cooper is focused on developing the next generation of Digital Disciples.\n“I’m coaching them to tell the story, and we want to amplify the messages for those in-person and online,” he said. “Our viewership all around the world makes my heart smile and joyful to see people connect to Christ through worship.”\nThroughout his career in faith-based media, Cooper has directed live performances, including Todd Dulaney’s Promises album, and has worked with gospel stars Donnie McClurkin, John P. Kee, Kierra Sheard, Melvin Crispell III, Jekalyn Carr, Myron Butler, Leandria Johnson, Kelontae Gavin, Erica Campbell, and Jonathan Nelson.\nHis mission work has taken him as far as Ghana, Africa, where he mentored ministry leaders and produced online classes for ministry leaders in Ghana to be taught by American teachers.\n“It’s not about a job, it’s about serving for me,” he said. “You don’t know how many people are homebound, in prison, in college—people who can’t make it to church. I love to do it, and I love to serve the local church.”\nCooper is also embracing innovation through artificial intelligence and teases upcoming projects aimed at further expanding his ministry’s reach.\n“We’re not trying to impress; we’re trying to invite,” he said. “Every lens is an open door to the Gospel. My calling is to build bridges between the church and the culture, using creativity as a tool for discipleship.”",

But I was constantly given new firmware to try as many of these issues seemed to had been addressed during my review.\nThis proactive approach to improvement is commendable. However, it also subtly hints that there might have been a rush to launch this product. But, on the brighter side, by the time you get your hands on these goggles, most significant issues should likely have been ironed out.\nAs I publish this blog post, a few minor concerns still remain, which I’ll go through in this review.\nDesign and Build Quality\nFirst and foremost, let me address the elephant in the room – there’s no ON/OFF switch on the Avatar Goggles X! I get it; it might be a sore point for some. But remember, you can always power down the goggles by simply unplugging the battery :)\nI must say, the new goggle design is refreshingly unique, diverging significantly from the Avatar goggles V1 and any other models I’ve come across. The Goggles X has a plastic housing with dark metallic paint finish that stands out.\nIts form factor is similar to the\nAvatar V1 (and Fatshark Dominator HD) and the DJI Goggles 2/Integra.\nThe menu buttons are similar to the original goggles, but they are now better placed and more user-friendly, conveniently located on the top right.\nA commendable upgrade is the introduction of the AV Input and HDMI input/output (Mini HDMI ports) located at the bottom. This means you can now use these goggles with analog through the AV IN and enjoy HDZero via the HDMI IN. You can use the goggles as an external monitor for your PC, to play movies or FPV simulators. You can also output video feed to an external monitor via the HDMI output.\nStandard in premium FPV goggles today, the Goggles X offers both diopter focus and IPD adjustments. The adjustment dials, though a tad stiff, ensure you don’t accidentally knock them out of focus.\nFor me personally, the stock faceplate’s fitment and comfort have seen improvements since the original V1 goggles. While there’s a slight light leak around the nose, it’s negligible during flights, the silver lining is that it’s not pinching on my nose which feels more comfortable during those long flights. The foam pad on the faceplate is held on with velcro, which means possible aftermarket replacements.\nIt appears the foam padding for the DJI Goggles 2 also fit the Avatar Goggles X, it’s great because there’re already a bunch of choices available on the market.\nThe fake leather head strap is attached with velcro, this makes it easy to adjust. You can even swap it out with a 3rd party strap. While I’d prefer it slightly wider, it’s sufficiently elastic and does the job.\nUser Experience\nWhile some might prefer the aesthetics of the V1, others may lean towards the Goggles X. Aesthetics are highly subjective. However, when it comes to user experience and the range of features, the Goggles X stands as a clear and monumental upgrade without doubts.\nFor those familiar with the Walksnail system, transitioning to the new goggles is a breeze. The way it works is exactly the same as the old goggles.\nThe menu buttons, similar to the V1, include two push buttons and a 5-way joystick (5D button). Their placement is spot on, especially for the 5-way joystick, enhancing usability. On the V1, the joystick is placed at an angle, it was easy to press the wrong direction, I’m glad they fixed it in the Goggles X.\nI didn’t notice any significant difference in RF performance compared to the goggles V1 when using the same set of antennas.\nWalksnail boasts of “doubling the optical clarity” in their marketing material. However, during my tests, the image quality, color, and sharpness of the new Goggles X, felt similar to the V1. Here’s a side-by-side screen image comparison, these are actual images of the screen, taken with my iPhone. There might be some inconsistencies in exposure, detail and color due to my phone, but they look almost the same in my experience.\nPossibly due to the slightly larger 50° FOV (field of view), I did observe a tiny bit of blurry edges and corners. I had similar issue with the DJI Goggles 2 for the same reason. I was hoping I could fix it by setting “Zoom Out” under Display to 90%, just like I did with the DJI Goggles 2, but this settings still doesn’t work like the previous goggles (screen doesn’t change).\nCheck here to compare Goggles FOV:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/js/fpvgogglefov.html\nWalksnail hinted at the potential to swap lenses for astigmatism, myopia, and blue light-blocking glasses, but I’m still awaiting for official instructions on how to do it.\nThe user interface (in-goggle menu) looks identical to the previous goggles, with additional options specific to this new goggles in the Device page.\nOne minor gripe is how long it takes to get an image from boot-up. It took 35 seconds from the point you plug in the battery to getting an image from the quad. With the V1 Goggles, it only took 27 seconds.\nDVR video recording: The file format is MP4, resolution is 1280x720p (depends on your transmission settings), bitrate is 50Mbps, basically identical to the previous goggles.\nYou can hear the anti-fog fan noise when wearing the goggles. Currently, there doesn’t appear to be an option to turn them off or adjust their speed. However, they seem to work in preventing the screens from fogging up so far, further testing is required in those summer days.\nEnhanced Antennas Performance\nThe Avatar HD Goggles X came with some great stubby antennas!\nFor those who recall, the Avatar Goggles V1 were notorious for their subpar antennas, which led to disappointing performances.\nHowever, with the Goggles X, the story is different. When I put these new antennas to the test, both on the old and new Avatar goggles, their performance was exceptional. Surprisingly, they even outperformed the DJI V1 Goggles antennas in terms of range and signal penetration.\nThe Goggles X is equipped with four omni-directional antennas, and they’re all removable. The antenna connectors are RP-SMA (there’s no pin in the antenna), allow for easy upgrades to directional antennas if you’re seeking better range and penetration. For most people I think the stock antennas should be enough, but if you want you can check out my FPV antenna recommendations:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/best-fpv-antenna/\nTo use third-party antennas, don’t forget to remove the washers first.\nSimilar to the Goggles V1, out of the 4 antennas, 3 are receive-only antennas, while only 1 can receive and transmit simultaneously. If you ever want to use a patch antenna, ensure you attach it to the receive-and-transmit antenna connector.\nThis receive/transmit antenna is at a different location. While it’s located on the top right (with the screens facing you) on the Goggles V1, it’s on the top left on the Goggles X (with the screens facing you).\nProximity Sensor\nBetween the lenses, there is an infrared sensor, which Walksnail refers to as Proximity Sensor. It’s there to detect whether the goggles are in use. If not, it will turn off the screens automatically. This thoughtful feature not only extends the OLED displays’ lifespan but also conserves battery.\nHowever, the sensor’s sensitivity seems low. There were instances when the screens wouldn’t turn on despite me wearing the goggles. To activate the displays, I had to press the goggles firmly into my face. And the moment I let go, the screens switch off again. I hope there would be a way to calibrate the sensor in the future.\nFor the time being, I’ve disabled this feature (there’s an in-menu option). I’m not a big fan of this feature, because it can take a second or so to turn on the screens, which can be a little inconvenient and dangerous. Imagine this: you lift your goggles for a quick line-of-sight check on your quad/plane and then put them back on again, you could be flying blind for a brief moment. The DJI Goggles 2 has a similar feature, and they don’t even have the option to disable it. I simply put a piece of tape over the sensor to keep the screens on at all times.\nModular VRX Board Design\nThe Walksnail Avatar Goggles X features a modular design, allowing users to replace the VRX board. But why should this matter to you?\nAccording to my contact at Walksnail, they are in the midst of developing a new digital system that is said to offer five times the range—extending potential distances up to 20km compared to the current system’s 4km. Expected to launch by next August, the Goggles X will be able to support this new system with a swap of the VRX board. This upgradability ensures the Goggles X will not become obsolete if Walksnail releases a new system.\nTo access the VRX board, start by removing the two screws located on the top of the faceplate.\nThen carefully unclip the top cover (you can use some plastic tool to pop it open), reveals the VRX board which is secured by 4 screws. Additionally, you’ll notice the Bluetooth/WiFi antenna taped to the inside of this top cover.\nCustomizable Front Cover\nThe front cover of the Goggles X features multi-color LED bars – a unique design in FPV goggles. You can set them to 3 different colors: red, green or blue, or just leave them turned off (there’s an option in the menu). These not only add a flair of personalization but also serve a practical purpose. By illuminating the LEDs, you get a visible reminder if your goggles are left powered on, whether they’re resting on a bench or lying on the ground.\nThis front cover can be removed, allowing for the installation of an adapter for an HDZero VRX module, or an analog receiver (possibly something similar to the\nBDI Digidapter).\nWalksnail offers a patch antenna to replace the front cover which you can purchase here:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/product-wikh\nPower Consumption\nThe Walksnail Avatar Goggles X handled power from 2S up to 6S batteries correctly as expected. The power consumption averages around 8.3W. Here are the current draws at various input voltages (consistent in different RF power levels):\n- 1.06A at 8V\n- 0.52A at 16V\n- 0.35A at 25V\nCompared to its predecessor, the Goggles X seem to be more power-hungry, use about 30% more power. The V1 consumed around 6.4W (for instance, 0.8A at 8V or 0.4A at 16V). However, one notable distinction is the voltage support. While the previous model could handle up to 21V, the Goggles X supports up to 26V. This means you can just pick up any 6S drone battery to power the Goggles X without ever worry about damaging your goggles because voltage is too high.\n- A 6S 1000mAh LiPo, or a 4S 1500mAh LiPo would last around two and a half hours.\n- A 4S 3000mAh Li-ion battery would last around 5 hours.\nInput Voltage Testing\nThe Goggles X appears to overestimate input voltage by 0.2V. While the error is so small and shouldn’t cause any issue, it would be nice if there’s a way to calibrate it.\nThe Goggles X intelligently identify the number of battery cells based on the initial input voltage. As the voltage drops below a certain level, sets off a low voltage alarm—typically around the 3.5V-per-cell mark.\nI tested the goggles using a bench power supply with variable voltage, starting from 26V and worked my way down. Here’s a breakdown of my findings:\n- At 21.0V: Constant beeping – this is the low voltage alarm for 6S.\n- At 18.8V: The beeping stops.\n- At 13.9V: The low voltage alarm for 4S is triggered.\n- At 13.0V: Beeping stops.\n- At 10.4V: The low voltage alarm for 3S is triggered.\n- At 9.2V: The beeping stops.\n- At 7.0V: The low voltage alarm for 2S is triggered.\n- At 5.6V: The beeping stops.\n- At 5.2V: The goggles shuts down. The screens go black, but the fan is still running.\nHaving a low voltage alarm at 3.5V per cell is ideal for LiPo batteries. However, for Li-ion it’s too high and there’s potentially 40% capacity left. Li-ion cells can typically be discharged down to 3.0V or even lower, having an option to change low voltage alarm would be a welcomed addition.\nInterestingly, the goggles remain functional even below their stated lowest input of 7V. But it’s worth noting that I’m uncertain if RF performance is impacted at such low voltage. For safety and optimal performance, it’s best to follow the recommended voltage inputs and avoid powering your goggles below 7V.\nFinally, the goggles seemed to skip the low voltage alert for 5S. Considering these findings, it might be wise to avoid using 2S and 5S batteries to power these goggles. 3S, 4S and 6S are all good choices.\nAnalog Support (AV IN)\nOne of the biggest complaints of the original Avatar Goggles was the lack of support for analog FPV system. Finally Walksnail has added an AV input in the new Goggles X, and analog support is now possible. The AV IN port is a 5-Pin 3.5mm Audio Port. I tested it with the\nBDI Digidapter from the DJI V1 Goggles, and it worked flawlessly.\nTo switch to AV mode, you have to long press the return button. This toggles you through the available video modes: AV IN, HDMI IN, and Walksnail’s native mode.\nOne advantage here is the signal behavior. When you lose signal, the Goggles X displays static just like a typical analog goggles. This contrasts with the\nDJI V1 Goggles, which would revert to its logo display, and be stuck there for an extended period. This “static screen” in the Goggles X allows pilots to immediately regain video feed as soon as signal is back.\nHowever, in AV mode, it defaults to 4:3 aspect ratio, with no option to switch to the wider 16:9. Hopefully this can be added in the future.\nTo use analog receivers, anticipate a need for a custom mount/adapter. It’s currently unknown whether Walksnail will provide such accessories, or the FPV community will have to take on the task of creating custom solutions.\nBeware that at the time of writing, DVR doesn’t work on the AV input or the HDMI input, it only works on the Walksnail Avatar mode. Pressing the record button does nothing in AV in and HDMI in modes. That means there’s no DVR for analog, and you would have to use an external device for that. Unfortunately this is a hardware limitation and this feature might not be available any time soon as far as I know.\nAnother bonus is that you can output the analog feed via the HDMI output, to a monitor or another goggles.\nHDMI IN\nThe Goggles X worked fine as an external display for my computer via the HDMI Input port.\nTo get into HDMI mode, press and hold the return button for a few seconds. This toggles you through the available video modes: AV IN, HDMI IN, and Walksnail’s video mode.\nIt appeared as a 1920x1080p display, and I could watch movies and play FPV simulators. On your computer, make sure to set it as “external display” and NOT “mirror main display”. However, there’s a design hiccup: the HDMI input port is recessed too deep into the goggle’s housing. This design choice means that some cables might be incompatible due to an inability to fully engage upon insertion.\nMoreover, while the goggles are compatible with the\nHDZero VRX module, to achieve a streamlined setup will require a custom-made mount, which again, is currently unavailable. The stock Mini HDMI cable from HDZero doesn’t work either. It does not insert fully into the HDMI port on the goggles for the reason mentioned above, so you’d have to get another cable with a longer connector.\nHowever, note that the HDZero’s 90fps Mode doesn’t work with the Goggles X – one of the most desirable features of HDZero. This means you can only use 60fps mode in HDZero when paired with the Goggles X.\nHDMI Out\nVideo output is now done via the HDMI out port. Note that it doesn’t support 1080p 100fps (high frame rate), since most displays that takes HDMI input doesn’t support that high frame rate (invalid format error), you’ll have to lower the walksnail system to 60fps (standard frame rate) in order to do video out. This might increase latency slightly but it is what it is.\nOther Minor Concerns\nApart from the highlighted issues, there are a few more quirks worth noting:\n- The actual range of IPD (Interpupillary Distance) adjustment turned out to be narrower than expected when I measured it using a calibre. My measurements suggest a range of around 58mm to 70mm (+/- 1mm), which is similar to the Avatar Goggles V1.\n- The absence of a USB-C port could be a drawback for some. For video output, an external display must be used via HDMI. A USB-C port would have been convenient for video output to an Android smartphone.\n- The maximum screen brightness of the Goggles X seems to be about 80% of its predecessor. I’ve raised the issue with Caddx and waiting for a reply, it remains to be seen if this is a hardware limitation or software related. I don’t think this is a huge problem because I personally never use maximum brightness anyway, as it actually hurts my eyes. Even under direct sunlight I normally find setting brightness to around 4 more than enough with the original Avatar Goggles, so for the new Goggles X, that would be around 6.\nConclusion: Should You Buy the Avatar HD Goggles X?\nOnce,\nthe HDZero Goggles were hailed as the most versatile FPV Goggles, supporting all FPV systems except DJI. Now, the Avatar Goggles X is competing for that title, with support for Walksnail, analog, and even HDZero, all at a lower price!\nThis raises the question: Which goggles are right for you?\nIf you already own the original Avatar Goggles V1, an upgrade might not be immediately necessary. That’s because the image quality and RF performance are largely similar between the two, unless the analog and HDZero compatibility is important to you, you might want to just hold on to your V1 until they drop the promised new system.\nHowever, for those new to Walksnail, the Goggles X presents a compelling option. Priced at just $459, which is lower than the flagship goggles from all other competitors including DJI, HDZero, Fatshark, Orqa and Skyzone, the Avatar Goggles X delivers the best Walksnail experience hands down.\nIf you have been only using the Walksnail External VRX module, now might be a good time to upgrade to the Goggles X to get the most out of this system.\nGet your Walksnail Avatar HD Goggles X from these vendors:\n- Caddx:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/product-72gy\n- GetFPV:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/product-camw\n- FPV24:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/product-513o\n- NBD:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/product-7d2n\n- AliExpress:\nhttps://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdK4xp1\n- Amazon:\nhttps://amzn.to/40bvG9o\nPros:\n- Competitive price point at $459\n- Stellar image quality\n- Compatible with Analog, HDZero, and Walksnail FPV systems\n- Comes with removable, high quality antennas\n- Supports 2S to 6S Power Input\n- Future-proof with modular VRX design\n- Adjustment dials for focus and IPD\n- Allows for prescription lenses\n- Customizable front cover\n- Comfortable faceplate foam padding\n- Intuitive menu buttons\nCons:\n- Higher power consumption\n- Missing USB-C video output (replaced by HDMI output)\n- Deep-set HDMI ports causing compatibility issues for some cables\n- Extended boot-up time\n- Reduced maximum brightness\n- Display Zoom Out setting still doesn’t work\n- Low voltage alarm sets to 3.5V per cell, too high for Li-ion batteries\n- No analog DVR yet\n- Some promised features are still work in progress – we don’t know when it will happen\nGoggles X vs. External Module\nWhen deciding between Walksnail Goggles X and the Walksnail external module, it’s essential to consider cost, user experience, and setup complexity. The Walksnail Goggles X, priced at $459, offers a straightforward, integrated digital experience. On the other hand, while initially seeming cost-effective, unless you can find a pair of analog goggles that’s cheaper than $220, pairing it with a $239 external module can quickly surpass the cost of the Goggles X. Not to mention most analog goggles out there have lower specs than the Goggles X.\nAdditionally, using the external module complicates setup and could introduce more potential troubleshooting issues. Given these factors, the Walksnail Goggles X is recommended for those seeking a hassle-free, high-quality digital FPV experience, while an analog setup might appeal to budget-conscious enthusiasts comfortable with more complex configurations.\nHow to Get Started?\nUsing the Avatar Goggles X is the same as other Walksnail goggles. If you need a detailed walkthrough, my setup guide is available:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/setup-avatar-fpv-system/\nGoggles X Beeping Indications\n- Link State: DI… DI… DI… DI…\n- Firmware Upgrade: DI……. DI……. DI……. DI…….\n- Upgrade Failed (due to missing SD card or firmware): DI DI DI DI\n- Boot Failure (Reboot or firmware update required): DI.. DI…… DI.. DI……\nEnabling FCC Mode\nOut of the box, the Goggles X might be in CE mode, meaning fewer channels are available and it’s limited to 25mW RF power. Switching to FCC mode unlocks all the channels (8 channels) and RF power levels (up to 1200mW), but do this if it’s legal where you are. Here’s how to do it:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/setup-avatar-fpv-system/#Unlocking-FCC-Mode\nHow to Link VTX to Goggles\n- Power on the VTX, wait until the green LED is flashing slowly.\n- Power on the Goggles, wait until you are in the home screen.\n- Press the link buttons on both devices. The VTX LED should turn solid red, and the goggles should start beeping. It should only take a few seconds to pair.\n- Once paired, the VTX LED should turn solid green, the Goggles should stop beeping, and you should get an image in the goggles from the drone’s camera.\nHow to Upgrade Goggles Firmware\nFollow the instructions here carefully for a smooth upgrade:\nhttps://oscarliang.com/setup-avatar-fpv-system/#How-to-Update-Firmware-on-GogglesVRX\nHere’s the summary:\n- Download the upgrade firmware with a file name like this: AvatarX_Gnd_X.X.X.img (X.X.X is the version number). Copy it to the root directory of the SD card. Make sure NOT to change the file name.\n- Insert SD card back in the goggles, and plug in the battery to power them on.\n- When you see the home screen, press and hold the link button on the Goggles for 8 seconds, and the Goggles should automatically restart and start beeping. (Do not power off during the upgrade.\n- The firmware update can take around 5 to 10 minutes, when complete, the beeping should stop and the goggles will reboot.",

    "text": "Migración Garduño busca evadir su responsabilidad por incendio en estancia migratoria, alertan ONGEl titular del INM intentará una vez más que un juez de control le apruebe una “solución alterna”, que en los hechos le significaría “liberarse del proceso penal que enfrenta por su responsabilidad en el incendio de Ciudad Juárez”, advierten organizaciones CIUDAD DE MÉXICO (apro).- Decenas de organizaciones sociales y defensores de derechos de personas migrantes alertaron sobre la intención del titular del Instituto Nacional de Migración (INM), Francisco Garduño Yáñez, de evadir su responsabilidad en el incendio de la estancia migratoria en Ciudad Juárez, en donde murieron 40 migrantes, 27 resultaron gravemente heridos y 15 mujeres sobrevivieron. En un pronunciamiento firmado por organizaciones defensoras de los derechos de migrantes, resaltaron que el 12 de agosto se llevará a cabo una audiencia en el Centro de Justicia Penal Federal de Ciudad Juárez en la que Garduño Yáñez intentará una vez más que un juez de control le apruebe una “solución alterna”, que en los hechos le significaría “liberarse del proceso penal que enfrenta por su responsabilidad en el incendio de la estancia migratoria de Ciudad Juárez”. Las organizaciones que representan a las víctimas, explicaron que la Suspensión Condicional del Procedimiento (“solución alterna”), considerada en el Código Nacional de Procedimientos Penales, “tiene por objetivo detener la persecución y proceso penal en contra del acusado y extinguir la acción penal”, pretensión final de Garduño a quien “no se le investiga por homicidio ni lesiones, sino por ejercicio ilícito del servicio público, por lo que la clasificación del delito para él es más benéfica, cuando su responsabilidad debería ser mayor a la de todos los imputados en el caso”. Las organizaciones destacaron que a los 16 meses de la tragedia “once personas de mandos medios y bajos, incluidos dos migrantes, continúan en detención acusados de homicidio y lesiones”, en tanto que Garduño lleva su proceso en libertad y sigue en funciones, mientras que el ex coordinador de Control y Verificación y Control, Antonio Molina, “se encuentra prófugo”. Tras recordar que el 30 de abril, el comisionado del INM fue vinculado a proceso por el delito de ejercicio ilícito del servicio público y que hasta ahora no ha rendido cuentas sobre el incendio ante el Poder Legislativo, las organizaciones firmantes consideraron que ante la próxima audiencia, “el juez debe negar -como ya lo hizo antes- la ‘solución alterna’, pues ésta tendría efectos absolutorios, es decir, ya no se investigaría más ni se le sancionaría incluso si después de concluidas las investigaciones se determinará una responsabilidad mayor en la tragedia”. Recordaron que en septiembre de 2023, Garduño promovió por primera vez la “solución alterna”, en la que se comprometía “pagar la diferencia del valor de los daños materiales del inmueble establecidos entre el perito de la Fiscalía General de la República (FGR) y la empresa aseguradora a cambio de detener la investigación en su contra, sin tomar en cuenta la reparación del daño a las y los sobrevivientes y las familias de los migrantes fallecidos”. Agregaron que Garduño volvió a solicitar la misma medida “aún cuando existe una suspensión definitiva de todos los procesos penales del caso otorga por el Juzgado de Distrito y sin la presentación de un plan de reparación del daño a favor de las familias de los 40 migrantes fallecidos y los 27 sobrevivientes”. Las organizaciones que representan a las víctimas hicieron un llamado “a las diferentes autoridades a no permitir la impunidad de la que goza Francisco Garduño y el INM ante las graves violaciones a derechos que han redundado en muertes al interior de las estaciones migratorias, incluso posterior al incendio en la estancia migratoria de Ciudad Juárez”. Al señalar que la FGR “debe terminar el proceso de investigación que culmine en un juicio justo para las víctimas”, resaltaron que Francisco Garduño Yáñez “se ha caracterizado por su falta de rendición de cuentas, como lo demuestran los 30 llamados y puntos de acuerdo que desde el Poder Legislativo le han hecho para que comparezca los cuales ha ignorado”. Para las organizaciones, “los operadores de justicia que protegen los derechos de las víctimas deben evitar dar el mensaje que en México la impunidad impera sin importar la gravedad de los hechos”, sobre todo si se considera que la Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos (CNDH) calificó los hechos como graves violaciones a derechos humanos en su Recomendación 111VG/2023. Las organizaciones que firman el exhorto a las autoridades están encabezadas por las que defienden a las víctimas, Derechos Humanos Integrales en Acción, Fundación para la Justicia y el Estado Democrático de Derecho, Asylum Access México y el Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración. A la petición se suman decenas de organizaciones y albergues aglutinados en el Bloque Latinoamericano sobre Migración, el Colectivo de Monitoreo-Frontera Sur, Grupo de Identidad y Educación y Grupo de Trabajo sobre Política Migratoria, entre otras más.",

    "text": "[Economia](/news-economia-finanza) Renard (Engie): \"Le rinnovabili sono l'unica strada per la decarbonizzazione\" Figino Serenza (CO), 17 ott. (Adnkronos) - “La strada delle energie rinnovabili è l’unica possibile per decarbonizzare il nostro mondo e far crescere l'elettrificazione sostenibile per i nostri consumi. Noi di Engie ci stiamo lavorando parecchio e oggi le rinnovabili sono in prima linea nella strategia del Gruppo. Negli ultimi anni abbiamo installato impianti di energie rinnovabili in tutto il mondo, lavoriamo su una trentina di paesi e alla fine del 2025 vogliamo raggiungere un primo numero magico: 50 gigawatt di impianti rinnovabili installati dall’Australia al Brasile passando ovviamente per l’Europa. È un piano ambizioso ma non ci fermiamo qua, abbiamo deciso di installare altri 30 gigawatt da oggi al 2030”. Queste le parole di Samuel Renard, managing director renewables di Engie Italia in occasione dell’iniziativa “Together for Safety” organizzata a Figino Serenza in provincia di Como e che ha visto la partecipazione del ministro del Lavoro, Marina Elvira Calderone e del top management di Engie, oltre ad aziende e associazioni di riferimento del settore energetico. Un importante momento di confronto con istituzioni e operatori del mercato energetico, volta a sensibilizzare gli attori coinvolti sul fondamentale tema della sicurezza sul lavoro. “L’Italia è un paese di rilevanza per il Gruppo - ha aggiunto Renard - Oggi abbiamo circa 600 megawatt di impianti installati in Italia. Nei prossimi 5 anni abbiamo previsto di installare 1 gigawatt. Vogliamo contribuire allo sviluppo di questo mercato e spesso siamo stati all’avanguardia. Siamo stati la prima società ad avviare un grande parco agrofotovoltaico in Sicilia, siamo stati i primi a crederci e ora tutto il mercato va in questa direzione. Vogliamo essere best in class su tutti i fronti, soprattutto sul tema della sicurezza sul lavoro”.

    "title": "LeMans24 2025, Toyota #7 fuori dalla Hyperpole: fatale una 'gialla' - News - WEC",
    "text": "Le parole dell’olandese\nLa Toyota avrà solo la #8 di Buemi, Hartley e Hirakawa oggi in pista nella Hyperpole della 24 ore di Le Mans. La #7 – che in questa 93esima edizione corre con una livrea ispirata alla ‘GT-One’ del biennio 1998-1999 per festeggiare i 40 anni della Toyota a Le Mans – è stata eliminata nelle qualifiche di ieri non riuscendo ad entrare nella top-15 (o meglio, top-16 alla luce della squalifica della Porsche #6 risultata sottopeso).\nNyck De Vries ha spiegato perché non è riuscito ad attestarsi sui tempi del compagno di marca Brendon Hartley che ha chiuso in 11esima posizione ottenendo il passaggio alla Hyperpole di stasera: “Non abbiamo un margine che ci permette di girare senza forzare per mettere al sicuro la qualificazione alla Hyperpole – le parole di De Vries riportate dalla testata sportscar365.com – nel giro migliore del mio secondo run ho dovuto alzare il piede per una bandiera gialla alle curve Porsche causata da una Alpine. Nel secondo giro ormai il picco di prestazione delle gomme è perso e ho trovato sulla mia strada un’altra Alpine alle esse Ford dove sono incappato in un bloccaggio. Potevo stare sui tempi di Hartley, dunque attorno alla top-10, ma niente di più”.\nOvviamente in una gara di 24 ore partire dai bassifondi della griglia delle Hypercar non è così drammatico e già nel 2024 l’equipaggio della #7 ha dovuto risalire dal fondo. Il problema secondo De Vries è che manca passo anche per quanto concerne il ritmo di gara: “Alla fine le qualifiche non sono rilevanti per una gara così lunga, come abbiamo visto l’anno scorso partendo dal fondo, ma dobbiamo in qualche modo trovare il ritmo per la gara. Al momento non credo che siamo sufficientemente veloci”.",

    "title": "Gerwyn Price breaks silence and is 'gutted' after Ally Pally exit to No28 seed - Daily Star",
    "text": "Gerwyn Price was sensationally turfed out of Alexandra Palace by Brendan Dolan as the 'Iceman' melted like a glacier in global warming. In a huge upset, 50-year-old Dolan progressed to the Paddy Power PDC World Championship fourth round with a 4-2 win against the No.5 seed. After his wife, Bethan, sat through a harrowing defeat alone in the players' enclosure, Price - who lifted the Sid Waddell Trophy here three years ago – can have no complaints.

Sky Sports is the only way to watch all the action this year. £22 a monthSky On an Instagram post he wrote: “Absolutely gutted with the chances I gave away tonight, trying too hard and beating myself up. “Just want to say how much I appreciate the crowd that got behind me. Just couldn't get a flow and Brendan took out every chance I gave him. Well done to him and hopefully I'll learn from this.” Look no further than 23 missed darts at a double, Gezzy. That's where your hopes of a second title went south. Do you think we'll see Price back at Ally Pally next year? Let us know in the comments section. Dolan, a popular Northern Irishman who is nobody's mug, was pipped 4-3 by Price at the same stage of the competition three years ago to the day. He milked his revenge like a dairy maid, and who can blame him? Dolan said: “I'm buzzing at the moment, feeling over the moon. I was thinking we might go to a final leg, to reminisce about what happened when we played years ago, but thank God we didn't. “If I go on to win the title, it would be perfect revenge, but it's too early to talk about that. As far as I'm concerned, Gezzy is a class act and he didn't deserve the boos.” Although his reception at the walk-on was mixed, Price cannot blame the crowd for scattering his arrows across the board as if they had been blown off-course by Storm Gerrit. Although he recovered from a supine opening set to level the contest, the Welshman never settled. And although he had not gone out of the tournament before the quarter-finals since 2018, Price played like a man who felt the whole audience wanted him to lose – even though they didn't. The 'Iceman' had revealed, after his first-round win against Connor Scutt, that he had almost withdrawn from the competition because he was apprehensive about fans getting on his back. But no excuses about hostility from the fancy-dress riff-raff – perceived or otherwise – will wash, nor explain, Price's hit-and-miss performance. And his body language was terrible. It wasn't so much Pan's People as Down-the-Pan's People. When Dolan took out 120 to take control of fifth set – his third ton-plus checkout of the night – Price's pained expression was pure despair. He never had control of the contest and got what he deserved.",

    "text": "Reprinted from the\nMiddle Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, Inc.\nThe Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association voted unanimously to elect renowned nature photographer and videographer Michael Kinney as its new Board President and Williamsport-area business owner Katie Caputo was elected to the Board of Directors.\n\"Michael's dedication to our association's work is unmatched. He cherishes every moment spent in our aquatic ecosystem and loves sharing those moments with people through his photos and videos, hoping to inspire them to get involved and make a difference,\" said Riverkeeper John Zaktansky.\n\"He dedicates countless hours to our association and leads by example, listens to others and is passionate about expanding our reach and impact across the 11,000-square-mile watershed we serve.\"\nKinney replaces Marissa Crames, who stepped down to take the position of Program Supervisor for the Vernal School Environmental Education Partnership.\n\"Ever since I was approached by a wild hellbender in 2017, I felt connected to the creatures in my local watershed because as a photographer I was somewhat representing these aquatic creatures to the community I was active in. I discovered the Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association a few weeks later and have been following an important mission of protecting the Eastern hellbender,\" he said. \"Along the way, I discovered how passionate the group represents not only the creatures of the river but the river as a whole from the tiny molecules all the way up to the people that live here and connects it all together as a public service.\n\"Leading a voice for the Middle Susquehanna into 2024 will open my opportunity to protect and improve the watershed we live in, providing a better habitat for the creatures I represent.\"\nYou can contact Kinney via email by .\nBorn and raised in a riverfront community along the West Branch of the Susquehanna, Caputo developed her love for the river as a little girl, spending summers enjoying all the benefits the river has to offer.\nThese early experiences led her to launch\nRoambler.com, a web-based marketplace platform designed to connect adventure seekers with local guides and mentors in Pennsylvania. Caputo believes that providing better access to positive experiences in the outdoors can lead people to love the places they live while building a foundation for environmental stewardship. She is passionate about working to protect the Susquehanna River so it can be enjoyed for generations to come, involved specifically in spreading information about a local Superfund site and sits on the board for the Robert Porter Allen Natural Center.\nYou can contact Caputo via email by .
