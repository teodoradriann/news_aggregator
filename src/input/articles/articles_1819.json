    "text": "MONSIGNOR Rudy Villanueva, an icon in Cebuano church liturgical music, passed away at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, May 23, 2024. He was 83. Villanueva, who used the pen name Renato E. Madrid, had been an important part of the devotion to Saint Pedro Calungsod, being the composer of many devotional songs to him, including “Way Sukod man ang Pagmahal,” “By the Power of Your Giving,” and the “Gozos of Saint Pedro Calungsod.” His other notable songs are \"Sugbuanon nga Simbahan,\" \"Umari ka,\" \"Espiritu Santo,\" and \"Cebu, Cebu.\" Villanueva had also made significant contributions to both secular and religious literature, writing plays in both English and Cebuano. He was also a trained composer and conductor. He published five books of Cebuano music and recorded his compositions, demonstrating his dedication to Cebuano culture. His renowned liturgical works included choral compositions, Masses, and musical dramas. He had published “Southern Harvest” \"Devil Wings\" (1997) and \"Mass for the Death of an Enemy\" (2000). His collection \"Southern Harvest\" included award-winning stories originally published in the Philippines Free Press and Asian Leader. Villanueva's academic background is equally impressive. He studied Philosophy and Theology at San Carlos Seminary in Cebu, literature at the University of Santo Tomas, and Music Composition at Mankato State University in Minnesota. In his younger years, Villanueva was on the staff at San Carlos Seminary in Cebu and taught at St. Joseph Seminary and Silliman University Music School in Dumaguete, which highlighted his commitment to education and mentorship in both religious and artistic fields. In 2022, the Cebu City Government awarded Villanueva the Order of Rajah Humabon Award for his outstanding achievement in the arts, music, and literature. (AML)",

    "text": "This Solitaire Game Is Taking the App Store by Storm\nToggle Dark Mode\nEvery now and then, you’ll find a new game that’s completely dominating the internet. Sometimes, there’s a really fun and addictive game everyone wants to play.\nWe recently saw it with Wordle, and it’s happening all over again. However, this game can potentially reward you for playing it. That’s right; you can even make some money if you’re skillful enough.\nWe’re talking, of course, about Solitaire Clash. Yes, we know what you’re thinking: how can a solitaire game be that fun? Bear with us; we’ll show you everything you need to know.\nSolitaire Clash: The Game You Need to Play Right Now\nSolitaire Clash is a simple but addictive game. As you can guess by its name, you’ll be playing a game of solitaire, but there’s more than meets the eye. If you’ve never played solitaire before, don’t worry; the game does a pretty good job explaining what you need to do. It’s easy to play but difficult to master.\nAs it turns out, there are a few differences that make this game as addictive as it is.\nOne of the biggest differences here is that you’ll be racing against the clock. The faster you finish the game, the higher your score will be.\nThere’s also another fun twist: you won’t be playing by yourself. This is a multiplayer game, so you’ll compete with other players around the world to come out on top.\nPlus, if you really want to test your skills, the game has multiplayer tournaments, in which you’ll play different game modes against five or ten other players to rank as high as possible.\nIf you manage to be one of the top three players, you’ll be able to choose your price, which, as we mentioned before, includes real-life cash.\nCan You Really Make Money With Solitaire Clash?\nThe short answer is yes, but don’t think about quitting your job to become a professional Solitaire player.\nSolitaire Clash lets you earn real-life money and transfer it to your PayPal account. The game also works with other platforms like Apple Pay, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Venmo, so cashing out is pretty easy and you know transferring your money will be secure and quick.\nYour prize pool will depend on the tournament you’re playing. Sure, you can find big prize pools, but keep in mind that the bigger the prize, the more people will try to get in. You’ll need to really bring your A-Game if you want to succeed.\nOf course, that’s easier said than done. You’ll also need to earn gems in order to participate in these tournaments, although you can skip the gems and enter your own cash to play. Think of it as a virtual casino.\nAnd for people in specific states that don’t allow cash games, don’t worry. According to Solitaire Clash, you can still play this game even if you’re in states like Arizona, South Carolina, or Vermont.\nYou will, however, need to be at least 18 years old to play.\nWhat Else Makes Solitaire Clash Great?\nIf earning actual money just for playing a game isn’t enough for you, Solitaire Clash also comes with some fun features.\nBesides the fact that Solitaire is already a pretty addictive game, this game also features special events. For instance, seasonal events like “Hallo-Scream” during late October let you undertake specific Halloween activities to earn gems and, of course, money, and recent holiday-themed events included a\nChristmas Sudoku and Passport Puzzler.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that this is a free-to-download game that features no ads. Unlike most free games on the App Store, you won’t be bothered by annoying pop-up ads after every match. So, even if you don’t care about the money, you can still play Solitaire Clash to have some fun without worrying about ads getting in your face.\nMake Money While Playing Solitaire\nWhether you love card games or making money on the side, Solitaire Clash is for everyone. You can have tons of fun playing by yourself or against other players around the world.\nOr you can see how far you can get in the in-game tournaments to really test your skills.\nWhatever you want to do, you can download\nSolitare Clash and play it for free. Try the game without spending any money, and maybe you’ll even make some money while you’re at it.",
