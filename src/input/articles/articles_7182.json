    "text": "BRIGHTON, England (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's top-four ambitions suffered a blow as they lost 4-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Thursday with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager.\nVictory would have put injury-hit Spurs above Manchester City into fourth spot but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot.\nA powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro's penalty gave the hosts a deserved 2-0 lead at halftime as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton's intensity.\nThe visitors responded in the second half with Richarlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over.\nHowever, when Tottenham's late substitute Alejo Veliz fired home from close range in the 75th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header a miraculous comeback suddenly looked possible.\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on 30 points while Tottenham remain fifth on 36, a point behind Manchester City in fourth.\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris)\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "A major cast member will be absent when Night Court returns with Season 2 on January 2. Kapil Talwalkar , who played court clerk Neil in Season 1, has exited as the comedy series has decided to take the show in a new creative direction, Deadline has confirmed.\nIn addition to his role in Judge Abby Stone’s (Melissa Rauch) court, Season 1 was setting up Neil to possibly have a romantic future with her as things with fiance Rand fizzled.\n“She’s very much a country girl and a country mouse who is now trying to become a city mouse. That is not a comparison to my size, though accurate,” joked Rauch in an interview with Deadline ahead of the show’s series premiere in January.\n“She’s in this relationship with Rand, which is a part of her life before she comes [to NY] and she’s really trying to hold on to that. We hear her talk about him a lot. But as she’s finally finding her footing in New York and realizing what she wants, she’s also coming to terms with what she wants in her relationship, too. And it also sets up a sort of love triangle with Neil and what the potential there could be in his feelings for her—which we will discover down the line and see how that unfolds,” she teased.\nSeason 2 will be more in the tradition of the original Night Court , which showcased different personalities, characters and perspectives,” sources close to production reveal.\nSeason 1 is currently available to stream via Peacock.\nTV Line was first to report the casting change.\nThe post Kapil Talwalkar Won’t Return To ‘Night Court’ For Season 2 appeared first on Deadline .",

    "text": "Founder and leader of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, Prophet Kumchacha\nFounder and leader of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, Nicholas Osei, popularly known as Prophet Kumchacha, has expressed his thoughts about marriage and the challenges it comes with.\nIn an interview with Zionfelix on February 19, 2025, Kumchacha noted that marriage does not have any significant value since it involves a lot of problems if couples are not compatible.\nHe went on to assert that if Jesus Christ had married, he might have missed heaven due to the temptation marriage brings, which could have led him to act contrary to his teachings.\n“If marriage were an easy thing, Jesus Christ would have gotten married himself. If Jesus had gotten married, he might as well have missed heaven, especially if he had married a bad woman. Prominent people are crying behind closed doors because of marriage.”\n“Marriage comes with a lot of drama, and if we were to come back to life again, I would plead with God to make marriage a contract so people can renew it when they are happy with it. If marriage wasn’t created by God, I would have said it is useless,” he said.\nProphet Kumchacha also noted that a lot of married people are going through depression and other forms of abuse due to settling down with the wrong partner.\n“A lot of people have died because of marriage. Because of marriage, people are going through depression and a whole lot of abuse. I see marriage as a poison. If we were to come back to life after death, I would plead with God to stop marriage itself,” he added.\nWatch the video below:\nMeanwhile, watch as Joseph Yammin warns NDC MPs over apologizing for Ken Ofori-Atta’s house raid\nJHM/EB",

    "title": "Male 'posing' as transgender allegedly raped inmate at all-women facility on Rikers Island, lawsuit says | Fox News",
    "text": "Warning: This report includes details some would find graphic or disturbing. A female inmate at an all-women correctional facility in New York has filed a lawsuit alleging that a male inmate raped her after he was given access to the facility by posing as \\\"transgender.\\\" Once inside, he was granted private access to women, including in bathrooms and as they were sleeping in bed. Now, she is suing the city. According to the lawsuit, which was filed by an anonymous plaintiff identified as \\\"Rose Doe,\\\" staff at the Rose M. Singer women’s jail on Rikers Island ignored her complaints about the male prisoner, who sexually propositioned, groped and raped her within days of him moving into the facility, the New York Post reported. The legal filing says the male prisoner, who is not named in the suit, moved into the facility on April 4, 2022, and Doe claims the rape took place on April 7. The alleged sexual assault stemmed from an incident on April 6, when the unnamed male stared at Doe \\\"while he masturbated\\\" and groped her in the bathroom. TRANSGENDER WOMAN SUES NEW YORK CITY FOR PUTTING HER IN A MALE PRISON ON RIKERS ISLAND The lawsuit, filed in November 2023, says the alleged perpetrator admitted to another inmate that \\\"he was not transgender, or gay, but that he was just there ‘to get p–y,’\\\" per the report. In the lawsuit, Doe also claims the alleged perpetrator was initially given access to the facility after he was encouraged to lie about his identity by Corrections Department staff. Fox News reached out to the New York Department of Corrections but did not immediately receive a response. The legal filing specifically names correction officers Jennifer Cruz and Rashida King as defendants in the lawsuit. A total of 20 defendants are named in the lawsuit, including the City of New York. NYC SHOULD BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OVER APPALLING RIKERS CONDITIONS, COURT-APPOINTED MONITOR SAYS The City of New York told Fox News that they could not \\\"comment on specifics of this lawsuit as it is active litigation.\\\" He was \\\"instructed to claim that he was transgender by DOC staff so that he could stay in the female dorm where he would have access to female inmates,\\\" the filing states. Nicholas Liakas, who is representing Doe, told The Post on Wednesday that some people have corroborated the claim. \\\"We have some accounts from inside the prison that as the [transfer] request was being made…the [DOC] officer said something along the lines of ‘if you want to go into the women’s facility, all you have to do is say you’re trans,’\\\" Liakas said. According to the filing, Doe wrote at least two complaints about the male inmate immediately after the initial incident on April 6, which were reviewed by the acting warden. The warden then relayed the complaint to the correction staff that the inmate ought to be removed, but he was not. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The next morning, Doe said she awoke to the alleged perpetrator removing her clothes and raping her. \\\"While [Doe] was sleeping in her bed, the Perpetrator, took the opportunity to sexually assault [Doe] again… pull[ing] down her pants while she was sleeping and begin[ing] to rape her,\\\" the lawsuit claims. The other women in the housing unit then assisted in throwing out the male's belongings, per the lawsuit. However, the defendants named in the lawsuit had a different reaction, as Doe claims they punished her instead of removing him. Doe was discharged from the facility in August 2022.",

    "text": "Calvert & House GOP would risk health coverage for 142,000 people in CA-41\nWith inflation rising and the price of eggs hitting all time highs, Ken Calvert and House Republicans are scheming to rip away health coverage for millions of American families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson doubled down on the GOP bait and switch, telling Punchbowl News that he intends to cut Medicaid: “We have a stewardship obligation to root that out and eliminate it.”\nLast week, far-right Republicans scored a huge victory when the Budget Committee adopted an amendment that ensured Republicans would seek at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid.\nDespite campaigning on making life more affordable for Californians, Calvert is poised to do just the opposite.\nDCCC Spokesperson Courtney Rice:\n“Ken Calvert knows exactly what he is doing. After Republicans accepted millions of dollars from billionaires like Elon Musk, they are choosing to screw over hardworking families with cruel cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax breaks for their same billionaire backers.”\n###",
