    "text": "The man who brought Tetris to the Western world three decades ago says it was never designed to have an end – calling the fact a 13-year-old managed to beat the game “kind of a miracle.”\n“This kid is amazing,” Henk Rogers told Global News about Willis Gibson. “I love what he did and the amount of energy that he put into it.”\nThe Oklahoma teen, who games by the name Blue Scuti, is believed to be the first person to ‘beat’ Tetris .\nIn a video viewed around the world , Gibson is seen rocking back and forth in disbelief when he advanced so far (at level 157) that the game essentially ran out of memory and froze, known as the “kill screen.” This was previously only accomplished by an AI program.\nStory continues below advertisement “Oh my God” Gibson repeats. “I can’t feel my fingers.”\nTwo decades before Gibson was born, Henk Rogers went to Moscow to secure the rights to Tetris for Nintendo’s Game Boy system. He successfully brought the game out from behind the Iron Curtain and became lifelong friends with its creator, Alexey Pajitnov.\nRogers was played by actor Taron Egerton in Tetris, a 2023 feature film about the game’s origin story.\nHenk Rogers and Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov. Supplied photo - Henk Rogers Rogers said that on Wednesday night he and Pajitnov shared a sushi dinner and marveled at Gibson’s achievement.\n“He’s amazed… the techniques that those kids use to get there, you know, in pushing the button faster than is humanly possible, so to speak, that’s in itself an accomplishment,” Rogers, speaking from Seattle, told Global News of Pajitnov’s reaction.\nStory continues below advertisement But Pajitnov, too, was firm that he didn’t design the game to end.\nGet the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. “I was like, ‘Okay, Alexey, don’t worry about that. It’s fine, you know. Let’s just enjoy the moment.’”\nRogers says he loves Gibson’s “dogged determination” — the teen is reported to play Tetris 20 hours a week.\n“I love the fact that his parents let him do it… I’m not so sure that I would have let my own son do this, you know, spend that much time on one thing.”\nMore on World Canadian soldier explains why he’s returning to Ukraine’s eastern trenches Fisherman saved by watch reflection after floating in ocean for nearly 24 hours Trump’s businesses received US$7.8M in foreign payments during presidency: report World economy ‘not out of the danger zone’ amid conflicts, UN says Overwhelmed by interview requests, the whirlwind of the accomplishment, plus being back at school after the holiday break, Gibson’s mother Karin Cox has not yet responded to a Global News request for an interview with the teen.\n“He will still need to do his homework, practice his clarinet, and go to bed on time!” Cox wrote in a Facebook post Thursday afternoon.\nPsychotherapist Dr. Dana Dorfman says she understands general parental concern about too much screen time, but believes games like Tetris can improve “cognitive capacities like spatial relations, problem-solving, even memory.”\n“If something is not necessarily compromising your functioning, I don’t necessarily think that it’s a bad thing,” Dr. Dorfman told Global News.\nShe says Tetris also offers mental health benefits, with stress-reducing and distraction components.\nStory continues below advertisement One of Canada’s top Tetris players agrees.\n“It’s a game that has given me so much in terms of opportunities, in terms of my own growth and development, in terms of the friends that I’ve met through the community,” Philip Ng said in an interview from Toronto. The twenty-nine-year-old is now semi-retired from professional play.\nHe told Global News he struggled with mental health growing up, as well as after the pandemic, calling the last two years especially challenging.\nTrending Now Strep A cases are rising in Canada. What symptoms to watch for Chip Wilson slams Lululemon’s diversity efforts: ‘You don’t want certain customers’ “In the most trying circumstances, in momenst of self-doubt or in moments of trouble, I am so grateful that I have this community to lean on who can remind me of who I am and to help me correct course.”\n2:26 Tetris to treat PTSD? And the wider Tetris community is definitely buzzing over Gibson’s achievements.\nStory continues below advertisement “Everyone’s going crazy… it’s just been lots of fun,” said Sean Brady.\nBrady, a semi-pro Tetris player, founded Tetris Canada about five years ago, hoping to build a platform for talented Canadian players.\n“I didn’t ever really expect or plan to get into the competitive scene, but after meeting some of the Canadian enthusiasts as well who just shared the passion of Tetris, it inspired me to start the Tetris Canada e-sports league,” he said in an interview from Thunder Bay, Ont.\nIn his Global News interview, Henk Rogers said knew he had a hit on his hands when he fought for the rights all those years ago. But even he couldn’t initially predict its lasting power. The initial paperwork he created for Pajitnov lasted only 10 years. By 1995, with no dent in the game’s popularity, he said he had to “rethink” the plan.\n“To me, it’s taken on a status like baseball or basketball or football. It is a basic game that I think is going to last forever.”\nRogers’ also credited Tetris’ perennial success to its constructive nature – building lines of blocks.\n“Creating order out of chaos is a basic human instinct … building is going to outlive destroying every time.”\nFor the past 15 years, and after suffering a near-fatal heart attack, Rogers’ post-Tetris passion has been tackling climate change – with a focus on getting to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2045.\nStory continues below advertisement He said determination, like new Tetris record-beater Willis Gibson’s, is what’s going to change the world.\n“People ask me if I have hope, and the answer is no. I don’t have hope. I have determination.”",

    "text": "Winter is here, and along with the charming snowfall and cozy evenings by the fireplace, comes the need to prioritize our health in the face of plummeting temperatures. This article serves as your go-to guide for maintaining well-being during the harsh cold, focusing on the incorporation of pulses with a warming effect into your daily life. The Winter Wellness Blueprint 1. Layer Up for Success Wearing multiple layers isn't just a fashion statement; it's a practical way to retain body heat and shield yourself from the biting cold. 2. Hydration Matters Although it's colder, staying hydrated is crucial. Opt for warm beverages like herbal teas or hot water with lemon to keep your body nourished. 3. Nourish with Warming Pulses Pulses, such as lentils and chickpeas, not only provide essential nutrients but also have a warming effect on the body, making them ideal for winter consumption. The Power of Pulses 4. Lentils: A Nutrient Powerhouse Packed with protein, fiber, and various vitamins, lentils are a versatile addition to your winter diet. From soups to stews, they add both substance and nutrition. 5. Chickpeas: Your Winter Energy Boost Chickpeas are not just for summer salads. Incorporate them into hearty winter dishes for a dose of energy, protein, and a feeling of fullness. Crafting Winter-Friendly Meals 6. Soul-Warming Lentil Soup Discover the joy of a steaming bowl of lentil soup. This comforting dish not only warms you up but also provides a nutritional punch. 7.

También será imposible eludir esta prohibición abriendo las fotos en una computadora, precisó Meta.\nDespués de haberlo anunciado en fase de prueba, el grupo también generaliza el \"controlador de desnudos\" en Instagram. Este controlador, configurado por defecto en las cuentas de los menores, detecta automáticamente las imágenes con desnudos recibidas en la mensajería y las difumina.\nEn abril, Meta había implementado una primera serie de medidas, incluyendo un control reforzado en las cuentas de usuarios menores, que ven limitadas sus interacciones con \"cuentas sospechosas\".\nLee también: Meta presenta su primer prototipo de gafas inteligentes de realidad aumentada\nEl acceso de estas cuentas sospechosas a las listas de suscripciones y seguidores de los usuarios menores, que hasta ahora estaba restringido, será completamente bloqueado.\nAl mismo tiempo, el grupo lanza una campaña de prevención contra la sextorsión dirigida a los jóvenes en Estados Unidos, Canadá, Reino Unido y Australia.\nEn julio, Meta también eliminó 63.000 cuentas relacionadas con sextorsión en Nigeria.",

    "text": "Dura lesión Durísimo golpe en Universidad Católica: revelan cuánto tiempo estará fuera Gary Medel El \"Pitbull\" se perderá importantísimos compromisos en el tiempo que estará fuera en la UC. Por Bastián Gómez\n20/02/2025 - 21:11hs CLT\n© JONNATHAN OYARZUN/PHOTOSPORT El \"Pitbull\" le entregó una malísima noticia a Tiago Nunes<br /> (Foto: Jonnathan Oyarzun/Photosport) Gary Medel se transformó en uno de los fichajes más destacados de este mercado de verano en el fútbol chileno. Luego de más de 15 años fuera de San Carlos, el regreso del “Pitbull” a Universidad Católica fue anunciado con bombos y platillos , aunque pese al poco tiempo que ha pasado desde su regreso, ya hay malas noticias sobre el jugador.\nTodo comenzó en el encuentro debut de los “Cruzados” en la Liga de Primera 2025. Los de “La Franja” vencieron por 3 a 1 al Audax Italiano en el encuentro que marcó también el reestreno de Diego Valencia , quien aportó con un tanto frente alos “Tanos”. Sin embargo, a los 52′, el histórico jugador de La Roja debió ser reemplazado por Branco Ampuero.\nDe inmediato se sospechó lo peor por el experimentado zaguero de 37 años. En la transmisión del encuentro se creyó que pudo ser un desgarro lo que lo sacó del partido. Hoy, ya existe un poco más de claridad al menos respecto de cuánto tiempo estará el exboca fuera de las canchas.\nver también\nMercado de Fichajes 2025: Universidad Católica le dice adiós a su gran candidato para reemplazar a Thomas Gillier\nSegún reveló el periodista Jorge Cubillos , quien cubre la actualidad de Universidad Católica en TNT Sports, Gary Medel estará “por lo menos tres o cuatro semanas sin jugar”.\n¿Qué partidos se perderá Gary Medel con Universidad Católica? En la siguiente fecha, precisamente el día 22 de febrero, la UC viajará hasta el Francisco Sánchez Rumoroso para medirse frente a Coquimbo Unido. Luego el primero de marzo, se verán las caras ante Deportes Iquique como locales.\nPero lo que más le complica la existencia a Tiago Nunes , es que el “Pitbull” además de no decir presente en los compromisos recientemente mencionados, es que tampoco sería siquiera opción en el banco ante Palestino por Copa Sudamericana. Dicho encuentro, está programado para el día 4 de marzo.\nGary Medel se perderá importantes compromisos con la UC (Foto: Javier Torres/Photosport) De ser cuatro las semanas que Gary Medel no estará disponible en Universidad Católica, también sería baja ante Colo Colo el día 16 de marzo , pudiendo recién volver ante La Calera para la cuarta fecha de Copa Chile.\nSin dudas, un duro mazazo no solo para el cuerpo técnico “Cruzado”, sino también para la hinchada del cuadro precordillerano y, por supuesto, mucho más para el jugador.\nLEE TAMBIÉN ¡Serían al menos cinco! ¡Serían al menos cinco!

    "title": "Se formó en River, fue a la Guerra de Malvinas y ahora se gana la vida como agente inmobiliario",
    "text": "El conflicto bélico de Malvinas en 1982 es un hecho que sigue siendo una herida en el corazón de los argentinos. Lo ocurrido en las islas tiene un sinfín de historias y algunas de ellas están ligadas al fútbol. Incluso, hay varios exjugadores que han dicho presente en la guerra como Omar de Felipe , Juan Colombo , Claudio Petruzzi , entre otros. Sin embargo, hoy hablaremos de Gustavo de Luca , un exdelantero que supo vestir la camiseta de River Plate .\n El exjugador tuvo la dicha de nacer en Buenos Aires el 13 de febrero de 1962. Desde joven que los planes de De Luca estaban vinculados al mundo del fútbol. Pese a que lo ocurrido en Malvinas le cortó temporalmente su sueño, el goleador pudo jugar en clubes del ámbito local como también destacarse en el fútbol internacional, más precisamente en Chile.\nInformate más Le ganó la final de la Libertadores a Boca y ahora se gana la vida en un taxi Conmoción en el fútbol: jugador murió tras chocar contra un muro en la cancha Cómo fue la carrera futbolística de Gustavo De Luca El \"Pelado\" se formó en las inferiores de River Plate. En la cantera del \"Millonario\", Gustavo tuvo la suerte de compartir equipo con jugadores como Sergio Goycochea , Nestor “Pipo” Gorosito y Daniel “Chino” Tapia . El 2 de abril de 1982, al jugador que tenía lugar en la reserva de \"La Banda\" le llegó el llamado al deber con su patria. Días más tarde le tocó vivir por dos meses una pesadilla: la guerra en Malvinas.\n“Pensábamos que se iba a arreglar todo muy rápido y de manera pacífica. Pero todo comenzó con el hundimiento del General Belgrano… faltó comida, ropa de invierno y no teníamos con qué protegernos. También carecimos de armamento. No nos podíamos comparar con Inglaterra”, comentó el exjugador en una entrevista para Infobae.\nA su vez, el que en ese momento era jugador de River contó que la guerra fue terrible para todos ya que ellos solo cumplían con el servicio militar, pero no eran militares de carrera. Según De Luca, todos los soldados tenían otros sueños que cumplir y muchos no lo pudieron conseguir por lo sucedido en las islas.\nEn medio de una batalla, Gustavo sufrió una herida de bala cerca de su cintura, además de algunas lesiones ocasionadas por esquirlas de una bomba que había sido detonada cerca de su posición.\nLuego de lo que fue la terrible vivencia en la guerra, se propuso continuar con su vida y con su carrera como futbolista. Según De Luca, el fútbol lo salvó de estar preso de los terribles recuerdos que le dejó el conflicto. Mientras que otros combatientes no pudieron sanar nunca, la pelota ayudó al ex goleador a no caer en la depresión y hasta mismo en el suicidio, como sí pasó con otros excombatientes.\nGustavo De Luca en River.png Una vez regresado a River, Gustavo sufrió una lesión en su rodilla que lo llevó a operarse. Es por eso, más que cargaba con el estigma de ser un excombatiente, que el club de Núñez lo dejó libre quitándole la chance de debutar en primera.\nLuego de que el \"Millonario\" no le haya dado chance, a partir de 1983 el delantero llevó sus goles al ascenso argentino. Nueva Chicago, All Boys, Talleres de Remedios de Escalada y Douglas Haig fueron los clubes que le abrieron las puertas al Pelado en Argentina, sin importar su vivencia como soldado en las islas.\nEn 1987, el exfutbolista fue para la segunda división de Chile, país donde cosechó sus grandes momentos. Arrancó su camino en Santiago Wanderers y un solo torneo le alcanzó a De Luca para ser el máximo artillero de la competencia con 16 tantos. Luego, en 1988 tuvo un pequeño paso en Cobreola para después jugar en Deportes La Serena , donde se convirtió nuevamente en el máximo artillero pero esta vez de la primera categoría.\nLas buenas actuaciones de De Luca lo llevaron a conocer Suiza para competir en condición de cedido en Baden , pero fue un paso fugaz. A los pocos meses, el exgoleador se encontraba de nuevo Chile para jugar en O'Higgins .\nYa en 1992, el argentino fue cedido a Colo Colo donde conoció la sensación de ganar un título en el fútbol profesional, ya que se consagró campeón de la Recopasudamericana de dicho año. Luego de campeonar con uno de los grandes del fútbol chileno, el jugador volvió a O'Higgins en 1993.\ngustavo_deluca.jpg Entre 1994 y 1996, Gustavo vistió las camisetas de Alianza Lima (Perú) y otros equipos chilenos como Regional Atacama , Deportes Temuco , Santiago Wanderers y Everton . La lesión que traía desde joven en la rodilla obligó a De Luca a colgar los botines a los 34 años cuando quizás le quedaban algunos goles por hacer.\n“Me dijeron que iba a jugar entre 10 y 12 años como profesional, pero fueron 14 hasta la hora del retiro. No fue una decisión por lo futbolístico ni por nada en especial, solo producto de la lesión”, comento en la entrevista a Infobae.\nQué fue de la vida de Gustavo De Luca tras su retiro del fútbol Luego de tener que colgar los botines por su lesión, Gustavo tenía la misma idea que tienen muchos futbolistas a la hora del retiro: seguir ligado al fútbol. Debido a eso, De Luca vivió un año más en Chile, se operó y volvió a Argentina para meterse en el curso de director técnico, estudio que le demandó dos años.\nSin embargo, el exjugador comentó que las cosas se fueron acomodando en otra dirección por lo que cambió drásticamente el rubro. Desde ese entonces hasta la actualidad, Gustavo de Luca se dedica a ser un agente inmobiliario debido a las inversiones que pudo hacer con propiedades en el país. “La verdad es que tendría que haber regresado a Chile porque soy más conocido allá que acá para dirigir, pero no me quise mover de mi país de origen”, reflexionó el exjugador.\nGustavo de Luca Malvinas.avif La historia de Gustavo De Luca es un recordatorio de la fuerza del espíritu humano y la importancia de perseguir los sueños con valentía y determinación. Así como lo hizo en Malvinas, el ex jugador de las inferiores de River destaca una gran capacidad para sobreponerse a las adversidades y reinventarse a sí mismo; su testimonio es un gran inspirador de resiliencia y perseverancia.",
