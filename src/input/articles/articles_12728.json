    "title": "Rare \"Rainbow Clouds\" Light Up The Sky In Scotland, Video Is Viral",
    "text": "Several people across the country were treated to views of the colourful nacreous clouds. Residents across Scotland witnessed a rare, natural light show with shimmering rainbow clouds in the sky. Several people across the country were treated to views of the colourful nacreous clouds. According to Newsweek , the rare view was captured on camera near Nairn Beach on Christmas Eve, shortly after sunrise around 9 am by Joshua Earle, a 29-year-old photographer. Mr Earle shared a video of the sighting on his Instagram account and wrote, \"These incredible clouds have been appearing across the UK this week. This video was taken near Nairn Beach at around 9:00 am this morning. I still can't wrap my head around what I'm seeing! Nature is simply amazing.\" He added, \"Also known as Nacreous, Mother of Pearl or Polar Stratospheric Clouds, this strange phenomenon is caused by high arctic clouds that contain tiny ice crystals that refract the sunlight. It's worth keeping an eye out at sunrise and sunset this weekend if you're in the UK. You might just spot a rainbow cloud!\" See the video here: A post shared by Joshua Earle | Adventure Travel (@explorewithjoshua) He told Newsweek : \"It was incredible on that morning. The horizon was full of these clouds and was more vibrant than before. Shimmering rainbows in the clouds. \"This was the first time I've seen these clouds but, funnily enough, they have appeared three or four times in the week leading up to the 24th,\" the photographer noted. Since being posted, the video has amassed over 3.8 million views on Instagram and 272,000 likes. Commenting on the video, a user wrote, \"They're called Polar Stratospheric Clouds. Now people saying they lived for years on this planet and thought they knew everything can start reading and learning...\" Another user wrote, \"Not rare!! Chemtrail chemicals in our air!\" \"My son passed away a few months ago and he's been painting the sky for your enjoyment ever since,\" the third user wrote.",

    "text": "[Community Corner](/florida/stpete/around-town) ‘Au Naturel’ St. Pete Yard Named A Certified Wildlife Habitat A St. Pete artist and writer has been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation for turning her yard into a safe space for FL wildlife. ST. PETERSBURG, FL — A St. Petersburg writer and artist has been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation for transforming her yard into a welcoming and safe space for wildlife. For years, Kathy LaFollett has worked to turn her yard into a sustainable green space that supports birds, butterflies, frogs and other Florida wildlife. Now, her Winston Park home — not far from Sawgrass Park and Weedon Island — has been awarded the Certified Wildlife Habitat designation through the National Wildlife Foundation’s Garden for Wildlife movement. Find out what's happening in St. Petewith free, real-time updates from Patch. “It was a cool thing to happen. I’ve been working through the last seven years on this kind of a thing,” LaFollett told Patch. The artist has long been drawn to wildlife and the outdoors. She recalls growing up in an Illinois farm town and loving being surrounded by nature and animals. And at 9 years old, she had a beloved pet parakeet. Find out what's happening in St. Petewith free, real-time updates from Patch. This changed her life, as she’s spent her life since then surrounded by animals, especially parrots and other birds. She even ran a website dedicated to parrots and has written several books of musings on birds and wildlife. This is why the Sunshine State was the perfect place for LaFollett and her husband to land. They first moved to Clearwater in 1999 and later, came to St. Petersburg. “I love Florida. I love the animals. I love everything in St. Pete,” she said. When she first moved to St. Petersburg, she knew she wanted to create an artsy safe haven for all kinds of creatures. “I wanted to paint murals on every wall in every room and I wanted to create that space where wildlife knew they were safe,” LaFollett said. She even dubbed her home the LaFollett B&B Rest Stop for animals, which later became the topic of a book. She befriended a crow, who she named Edward, and later the bird’s wife, who she named Helen. They had a child named Jack. “And Jack became a book,” she said. “Jack is my bud. He still comes and visits.” She also has a group of Muscovy ducks that often sleep on her porch. Everything about her yard has been informed by the needs of local animals, she added. “I let the wildlife dictate to me what was going on. We’re just the caretakers.” The flowers and other plants on her property are “as native as possible,” LaFollett said. She also doesn’t use pesticides and incorporates other sustainable practices, like conserving water. Now with a sign in her yard proudly declaring it a Certified Wildlife Habitat, she hopes to lead by example in her neighborhood. “I get to be the pied piper of being au naturel,” she said. LaFollett said that no matter the size of the property or space — even a tiny apartment — “it’s as simple as a heart attack to create a sustainable space that draws local wildlife and insects. “Food, water, protection, a place to nest. That’s all you need,” she said. “If you have all those things and you don’t use pesticides, you don’t use fertilizer, you stay au naturale, you’re in.” She added, “You don’t have to do an entire property like me, because I’m a mad woman and I’m unemployed. You can just do a couple of pots, planters on the patio, a bird feeder, a bird bath, give a good home to a toad, and you’re in. It’s so small, but so important.” Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

    "text": "EDMONTON — Alberta's electricity operator says it ended a grid alert after more wind and solar power on Monday helped ease strain on the system.\nBut the Alberta Electric Systems Operator says people should continue to conserve power into the evening, as extremely cold temperatures continued to pose problems.\n\"We've gone for a period of the last few days where we had almost no wind and we were on very short supply, and that created additional challenges and additional stress on the grid,\" said operator spokesperson Leif Sollid.\n\"Now we're starting to see more wind, which certainly does help us meet demand here across Alberta.\"\nThe operator issued four alerts since Friday, urging residents to conserve power during peak times and warning of the possibility of rotating blackouts if demand got too high.\nIt partially pinned the crisis on a handful of gas generators that weren't fully operating, as well as a lack of renewable energy being produced due to low winds and a shortage of daylight at this time of year.\nSollid said one natural gas generator was out on planned maintenance, while frigid temperatures caused several others to go off-line completely or partially.\nHe said he can't identity which plants had issues or speculate on when they might fully operate again.\nSollid said it was the first time the operator sent out emergency alerts over grid problems. And Albertans listened.\nMore than 200 megawatts in grid space became available when Albertans turned off lights or unplugged what they could, he said.\n\"Demand immediately dropped from the system and that was enough to allow us to avoid having to go on rotating outages,\" Sollid said.\n\"Had we not have been able to conserve that electricity, we would have been forced to implement rotating outages across the province.\"\nHe said Saskatchewan sent 153 megawatts of energy on Saturday, an above-normal amount. British Columbia also supplied about 400 megawatts, which is normal.\n\"The 150 megawatts (from Saskatchewan) was extraordinary. That was well above and beyond what we would ever expect to import,\" Sollid said.\nHe said he couldn't speculate how the grid would fare Monday night, as it's managed in real time.\nAbout 30 per cent of Alberta's grid comes from renewable sources, Sollid added.\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe have criticized Ottawa's green-energy plans. After the alerts were issued, they said renewables can't be depended upon when temperatures drop.\nRandy Boissonnault, the only federal cabinet minister from Alberta and one of only two Liberal MPs from the province, called the statements from the premiers \"a petty, untrue and partisan attack.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 15, 2024.\n— By Jeremy Simes in Regina\nThe Canadian Press\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story; An earlier version said there had been three grid alerts since Friday.",

    "text": "14 Insights That Define the 1970s Experience\nHave you ever wondered what life was like in the United States during the 1970s? For anybody born in the 2000s, these insights will surely come as a shock!\n1. Men Had Long Hair\nIn the 70s, women weren't the only gender to sport long hair. Sure, in 2023, there's a fair amount of men rocking long hair, but back then, you weren't cool unless you had a long, gorgeous head of hair – male or female.\n2. Hippies Were Everywhere\nOne aspect of 70s culture seems stereotypical at first, but the reality is that it's true: hippies were everywhere! Flower power was going strong, and the free love movement was never stronger than during this time in American history.\n3. Psychedelic Drugs Were Everywhere\nYou can't mention hippies without mentioning drug use, can you? Psychedelic drug use was at an all-time high in the United States in the 1970s – and as a direct (or indirect, depending on who you ask) result, some of the most incredible music in history was born.\n4. Gas Stations Were Full Service\nMany people would love for 1970s-style service to return to gas stations nationwide! Gas stations competed by offering free drinking glasses and other goodies, and attendants automatically checked your oil, your tire pressure, and even cleaned your windshield.\n5. Graffiti Was Symbolic\nWhile urban graffiti has always been prevalent in America, during the 70s, the ubiquitous peace sign was used in most street art. It served as a reminder of that generation's contempt for foreign wars in which the United States frequently found itself.\n6. Everyone Trusted the Media\nImagine a time in history when “fake news” didn't exist, and there weren't countless media organizations with differing ideologies reporting the news daily. The six o'clock news was trusted, newspapers were believable, and fake news was only in tabloids.\n7. Pay Phones Were Everywhere\nIt makes sense: cell phones were still decades away from becoming permanently embedded in\nAmerican culture. As a result, pay phones were everywhere, and if you were outside of your home, using pay phones was the only way to get in touch with anyone else.\n8. Libraries Were Always Packed\nDue to the lack of internet and cell phones, students in the 70s were destined to spend long hours in the local library. It was the only place to do research for papers.\n9. College Education Was Affordable\nWhile not a trait exclusive to the 1970s, the fact that college education was affordable for all Americans makes me wish I had been born at least a few decades earlier! Imagine how wonderful it would be not to be crippled with extensive student loan debt.\n10. Traveling by Plane Was Wonderful\nAirline seats had legroom back in the day! You got free, real meals on flights longer than two hours. The TSA didn't exist, there were no airport security checks, and airline passengers had plenty of space.\n11. There Was One Activity for Young People\nIn the 70s, if you were cool and young, you were only interested in one nighttime activity: cruising the streets.\n12. Watching TV Was Different\nWatching your favorite television shows in the 70s was appointment-viewing in every sense. VCRs and time-shifting recording devices didn't exist yet, so if you missed a show, you were out of luck! I'm getting stressed just thinking about this scenario!\n13. Hitchhiking Was Common\nWhile everyone has heard plenty of hitchhiking horror stories, the practice was common in the 70s. Many people who grew up back then said it was so prevalent that, in retrospect, it felt like the precursor to modern-day ride-sharing services.\n14. The National Speed Limit Was 55 Miles per Hour\nCountless people recall the national uproar when the United States enforced a nationwide 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. People were not happy! Luckily, in today's world, you'll rarely see speed limits lower than 65 miles per hour on main highways.",

    "text": "Although LSU hasn’t perfected its parking lots, roads or classrooms, here on campus, game days are something the tigers do best. A few simple necessities will make for a memorable tailgating experience:\nFully Stocked Cooler\nGame days on campus typically mean long hours spent outside in the Louisiana sun. Every tent needs a cooler or two to keep tailgaters’ beverages ice cold. No matter what the beverage of choice may be, it’s not an LSU tailgate without a cold drink in hand.\nSpeaker\nA tailgate isn’t complete without a speaker blasting an upbeat game day playlist. Songs like “Calling Baton Rouge,” “Louisiana Saturday Night” and “Eye of the Tiger” are a few staples. The bigger the speaker the better. Preferably the music is just loud enough to be heard from the next tent over.\nFood\nEvery successful tailgate has a selection of delicious food to keep its guests fed. Ideally a tent would be stocked with home-cooked dishes like jambalaya, pastalaya, boudin and barbeque. Bringing a portable grill and cooking on site is a great way to elevate a tailgate.\nFootwear\nThere are two options for footwear on game days. Either a practical sneaker that will be comfortable all day or a classic pair of leather cowgirl/cowboy boots that make a tailgate outfit photo-worthy. Will the boots be hot and potentially painful? Yes. Are they worth the fashion statement? Also yes.\nLawn Chair\nA lawn chair equipped with cup holders is the perfect addition to any game day tent. Friends and family will fight for the chance to rest their feet even for a few minutes. Although it may not seem like too much of a hassle, it’s worth hauling at least one chair from the car to the tailgating grounds.\nClear Bag\nDeath Valley has a strict clear bag policy, but local boutiques have plenty of trendy clear purses that make the perfect accessory to a purple and gold game day outfit. Don’t forget extra cash for a stadium hot dog and cover for the bar after a tiger win.",

    "text": "VIERNES, 5 de enero de 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Una rara mutación genética encontrada en un 1 por ciento de las personas de ascendencia europea parece reducir a la mitad sus probabilidades de enfermedad de Parkinson, encuentra un estudio reciente.\nTe puede interesar: Los desfibriladores son obligatorios en algunos gimnasios y estadios, ¿por qué no hay más personas usándolos?\nUna mejor comprensión de cómo funciona este fragmento de ADN podría conducir a una mejor prevención y tratamiento del Parkinson en general, dijeron investigadores de la Universidad del Sur de California (USC).\n\"Este estudio avanza en nuestra comprensión de por qué las personas podrían contraer Parkinson y cómo podríamos desarrollar nuevas terapias para esta enfermedad devastadora\", dijo el autor principal del estudio, el Dr. Pinchas Cohen, quien descubrió por primera vez la variante genética en 2016. Es profesor de gerontología, medicina y ciencias biológicas en la USC.\nTe puede interesar: La detección por tomografía computada de cáncer de pulmón puede salvar vidas, pero un estudio encontró desventajas\nComo explicaron los investigadores, la variante genética surge en una \"microproteína\" llamada SHLP2 que se encuentra dentro de las fábricas de energía de la célula, las mitocondrias.\nInvestigaciones anteriores realizadas por el laboratorio Cohen encontraron que las personas lo suficientemente afortunadas como para portar la variante también parecían estar protegidas de enfermedades relacionadas con el envejecimiento, como el cáncer.\nTe puede interesar: Cuáles son los siete datos claves del glaucoma, según los expertos\nTambién encontraron que los niveles de la microproteína SHLP2 aumentan a medida que el cuerpo intenta defenderse contra la enfermedad de Parkinson.\nEn su investigación más reciente, el equipo de la USC evaluó a miles de estadounidenses mayores inscritos en dos cohortes de estudio principales.\nAl comparar a las personas de ascendencia europea que fueron diagnosticadas con Parkinson con las que no tenían la enfermedad, el grupo de Cohen encontró que la variante genética redujo las probabilidades de contraer Parkinson en un 50 por ciento.\n¿Cómo lo hace?\nEl equipo cree que la variante cambia el código genético de la proteína SHLP2 en una sola letra, lo suficiente para aumentar su producción y hacerla más estable.\nTodo esto conduce a una \"mayor protección\" por parte de los portadores de genes contra cualquier disfunción de las mitocondrias celulares, según el comunicado de prensa de la USC. La disfunción mitocondrial se ha vinculado previamente con la enfermedad de Parkinson, anotaron los investigadores.\nEstas conexiones celulares se confirmaron aún más en experimentos realizados en muestras de tejido humano y ratones, anotó el grupo de Cohen.\nEsto sigue siendo ciencia muy temprana, por supuesto, pero \"resalta los efectos biológicos de una variante genética particular y los mecanismos moleculares potenciales por los que esta mutación podría reducir el riesgo de enfermedad de Parkinson\", dijo el autor principal del estudio, Su-Jeong Kim.\nLos hallazgos \"podrían guiar el desarrollo de terapias y proveer una hoja de ruta para comprender otras mutaciones encontradas en las microproteínas mitocondriales\", señaló en un comunicado de prensa de la Universidad de California Kim, profesor asistente asistente de investigación adjunta de gerontología de la Facultad de Gerontología Leonard Davis de la universidad.\nLos hallazgos se publicaron en la edición del 3 de enero de la revista Molecular Psychiatry.\nMás información\nPuedes obtener más información sobre la enfermedad de Parkinson en la Parkinson's Foundation.\nFUENTE: Universidad del Sur de California, comunicado de prensa, 3 de enero de 2024\nMás Noticias\nHealthday Spanish\nUna mutación genética protege contra la enfermedad de Parkinson\nhttps://www.infobae.com/salud/2024/01/05/inhalar-una-estatina-podria-ayudar-a-aliviar-el-asma-y-la-epoc/\n¿Inhalar una estatina podría ayudar a aliviar el asma y la EPOC?\nhttps://www.infobae.com/salud/2024/01/05/las-migranas-podrian-aumentar-el-riesgo-de-accidentes-para-los-conductores-mayores/\nLas migrañas podrían aumentar el riesgo de accidentes para los conductores mayores\nhttps://www.infobae.com/salud/2024/01/05/un-estudio-sobre-la-nicotina-muestra-el-poder-de-la-mente-cuando-se-trata-de-drogas/\nUn estudio sobre la nicotina muestra el poder de la mente cuando se trata de drogas\nhttps://www.infobae.com/salud/2024/01/05/los-ninos-obesos-podrian-estar-en-riesgo-de-tener-problemas-renales-mas-adelante/\nLos niños obesos podrían estar en riesgo de tener problemas renales más adelante\nMÁS NOTICIAS",
