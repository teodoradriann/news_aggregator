    "text": "Топовый состав для 2020 года: Бил договорился с Финиксом о выкупе контракта, чтобы подписаться с Клипперс\nАтакующий защитник Брэдли Бил и Финикс Санз согласовали выкуп его контракта, что позволит баскетболисту покинуть команду.\nОб этом сообщает инсайдер ESPN Шэмс Чарания.\nСтороны договорились об условиях расставания: Бил отказался от 13,9 миллиона долларов из его 110-миллионного контракта, который был рассчитан на следующие два сезона. 32-летний игрок получит 96 миллионов, которые будут растянуты на 5 лет по условиям выкупа контракта.\nСогласно источнику, после того, как он покинет рынок отказов, Брэдли Бил присоединится к Клипперс на двухлетнем контракте на 11 миллионов с опцией игрока на второй сезон.\nТак что стартовая пятерка коллектива из Лос-Анджелеса будет выглядеть следующим образом:\n- Джеймс Харден;\n- Брэдли Бил;\n- Кавай Леонард;\n- Джон Коллинз;\n- Ивица Зубац.\nБрэдли Бил провел в Финиксе последние два сезона, однако этот союз не оправдал себя: в первый год команда с Билом не смогла преодолеть первый раунд плей-офф, а в прошлом сезоне она не вышла даже в турнир плей-ин.\nВ 106 матчах за франшизу из Аризоны баскетболист набирал в среднем 17,6 очка, 3,9 подбора и 4,1 передачи при реализации 49% бросков с игры, 38% трехочковых и 80% штрафных.\nНапомним, что перестройка Финикс Санз началась с обмена Кевина Дюранта в Хьюстон Рокетс.",

    "text": "NAIROBI, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 20.1 million people were internally displaced in July in the Horn of Africa region, the United Nations migration agency said Thursday.\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a report released in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, that the number is an increase from 19.2 million people in June as it attributed the total surge to a rise in internally displaced persons from Burundi, Ethiopia, and Sudan.\nMost of the displaced people were in Sudan (10.7 million), Somalia (3.5 million), Ethiopia (3.3 million) and South Sudan (2 million).\n\"There are 10.2 million newly forcibly displaced people in Sudan, including 7.9 million internally and 2.1 million in neighboring countries since the beginning of the conflict in April 2023,\" the IOM said.\nOther causes of displacements, according to the UN agency, are floods caused by heavy rains and food insecurity, especially in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.\nIOM also noted that the Greater Horn of Africa region had some 5.4 million refugees and asylum seekers.\nUganda hosts the most number of refugees at 1.7 million, followed by Ethiopia at 1 million, and Kenya at 906,000.\nAbout 67 million people were food insecure in the region in July, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional bloc in Africa.\nOf the number, 39 million are in IGAD member states, including Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Sudan, and Uganda.\nOn Aug. 2, international agencies issued an alert that the Horn of Africa would experience below-average rainfall during the October-December season that would transition to drought. This would mean a rise in the number of displaced persons due to food insecurity. ■",

    "text": "MRK | 16 minutes ago In the Phase 2b/3 trial, clesrovimab reduced RSV-associated hospitalizations (secondary endpoint) and RSV-associated lower respiratory infection hospitalizations (tertiary endpoint) by more than 84% and 90%, respectively, through 5 months\nClesrovimab has the potential to become the first and only approved immunization designed to protect infants with the same single dose regardless of weight for the duration of their first RSV season\nMerck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of positive results from the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial (MK-1654-004) evaluating clesrovimab, the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s investigational prophylactic monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease during their first RSV season. The results, along with interim findings from the ongoing Phase 3 trial (MK-1654-007) of clesrovimab, were presented during IDWeek 2024, held October 16-19 in Los Angeles, California.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241017875997/en/\nFigure 1 (Graphic: Business Wire)\nResults from MK-1654-004, a placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 pivotal trial evaluating a single dose of clesrovimab administered to healthy preterm and full-term infants (birth to 1 year of age) met all prespecified endpoints, with consistent results through both the 5-month and 6-month time points. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were comparable between the clesrovimab and placebo groups, and there were no treatment or RSV-related deaths during the study.\n“RSV continues to be a widespread seasonal infection that can affect both healthy and at-risk infants and is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; said Dr. Octavio Ramilo, chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude&CloseCurlyQuote;s Children&CloseCurlyQuote;s Research Hospital and investigator for the MK-1654-004 and MK-1654-007 trials. “The MK-1654-004 study evaluated a broad spectrum of RSV disease ranging from mild outpatient illness to severe disease requiring hospitalization. These promising results demonstrating decreased incidence of RSV disease, including hospitalizations, highlight the potential for clesrovimab to play an important role in helping to alleviate the continued burden of RSV on infants and their families.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the trial, the reduction in incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections (MALRI) requiring ≥ 1 indicator of lower respiratory infection (LRI) or severity compared to placebo through Day 150 (5 months) postdose, was 60.4% (95% CI: 44.1, 71.9, p<0.001). Clesrovimab also reduced RSV-associated hospitalizations (secondary endpoint) and RSV-associated LRI hospitalizations (tertiary endpoint) through Day 150 (5 months) compared to placebo by 84.2% (95% CI: 66.6, 92.6, p<0.001) and 90.9% (95% CI: 76.2, 96.5), respectively. Clesrovimab reduced the incidence of severe MALRI (tertiary endpoint) by 91.7% (95% CI: 62.9, 98.1).\nIn addition, in a post hoc analysis, the reduction in incidence of MALRI requiring ≥ 2 indicators of LRI and severity (an endpoint of more severe MALRI than the primary MALRI endpoint), was 88.0% (95% CI: 76.1, 94.0) through Day 150 (5 months).\nAdditional details on the data from the MK-1654-004 trial across RSV disease burden are presented in order of decreasing disease severity endpoints in Figure 1 above.\nMerck also announced data from a planned interim analysis of the MK-1654-007 trial, a Phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of clesrovimab versus palivizumab in infants and children at increased risk for severe RSV disease. The primary endpoint of the study is the safety and tolerability of clesrovimab in infants entering their first RSV season. Interim results showed clesrovimab had a comparable safety profile to palivizumab, and no drug-related serious AEs were reported to date. Incidence rates of RSV-associated MALRI requiring ≥ 1 indicator of LRI or severity and RSV-associated hospitalizations (secondary endpoints) were also comparable between clesrovimab (3.6% and 1.3%, respectively) and palivizumab (3.0% and 1.5%, respectively) through Day 150 (5 months).\n“The breadth of data presented at IDWeek highlight the potential for clesrovimab to help lessen the significant impact RSV can have on infants and their families, as well as the strain on healthcare systems due to high infection and hospitalization rates,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; said Dr. Paula Annunziato, senior vice president, infectious diseases and vaccines, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These clinically meaningful findings also reinforce the potential for clesrovimab to be the first and only immunization designed to protect both healthy and at-risk infants using the same dose, regardless of weight. We look forward to continuing to discuss these data with health authorities around the world with the goal of making clesrovimab available for infants as early as the 2025-26 RSV season.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;\nAbout MK-1654-004\nMK-1654-004 ( NCT04767373 ) is a Phase 2b/3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of clesrovimab in healthy preterm and full-term infants from birth to 1 year of age entering their first RSV season. The study enrolled 3,632 participants who were randomized 2:1 to receive either a single fixed dose of clesrovimab (105 mg intramuscular injection (IM)) or placebo on Day 1. Primary endpoints included the incidence of participants with RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infection (MALRI) from Day 1 (postdose) to Day 150 as compared to placebo and safety. The MALRI definition required > 1 indicator of LRI or severity. RSV-associated hospitalization through Day 150 and MALRI requiring > 1 indicator of LRI or severity to Day 180, were prespecified secondary endpoints. Prespecified tertiary endpoints included acute respiratory infection, RSV-associated lower respiratory infection hospitalizations and incidence of severe MALRI through Day 150. In a post hoc analysis, more severe forms of RSV-associated MALRI ( > 2 indicators of LRI and severity) were assessed. Across endpoints, additional measures of efficacy were assessed through Day 180. Safety measures included the percentage of participants with solicited injection-related adverse events (AEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs) solicited systemic AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs).\nAbout MK-1654-007\nMK-1654-007 ( NCT04938830 ) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, controlled study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of clesrovimab in infants and children at increased risk for severe RSV disease compared to palivizumab. The study enrolled participants who were entering their first RSV season and recommended to receive palivizumab due to prematurity (≤35 weeks gestational age), chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity, or hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive clesrovimab (105 mg IM on Day 1, placebo on Day 28) or monthly palivizumab in their first season, and eligible participants received clesrovimab (210 mg IM) in the second RSV season. At this interim analysis, 901 participants were enrolled in the trial. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability of clesrovimab versus palivizumab in the first season. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections (MALRI) requiring ≥1 indicator of LRI or severity and of RSV-associated hospitalization through Day 150.\nAbout clesrovimab (MK-1654)\nClesrovimab (MK-1654) is an investigational, extended half-life monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed as a passive immunization for the prevention of RSV. Clesrovimab is designed to be administered as the same single dose, regardless of birth weight, and is being studied in healthy preterm, full-term and at-risk infants to provide direct, rapid, and durable protection through their first RSV season against mild, moderate and severe RSV.\nAbout RSV\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus that causes widespread seasonal infections like the flu, with a worldwide burden in infants and older adults. There is high unmet need for preventative options in both healthy and high-risk infants. Globally, RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for healthy infants under a year old. RSV can lead to serious respiratory conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia, causing an estimated 101,000 deaths a year worldwide in children under five. According to the CDC, RSV season starts in the fall and peaks in the winter in most regions of the United States, but timing and severity in a given community or region can vary year to year.\nAbout Merck\nAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

O anúncio foi feito, nesta quarta-feira (2), pelo presidente do BC, Gabriel Galípolo, durante evento de celebração dos 60 anos da autarquia.\nDentre as novidades, Galípolo mencionou o Pix por aproximação, o Pix parcelado e o Pix como garantia.\nAlém das novas modalidades em estudo, o Banco Central dará seguimento ao processo de segurança do Pix para rastrear os recursos e evitar golpes.\nTambém durante o evento, o presidente do BC também afirmou que um dos desafios essenciais da instituição é o da comunicação. Por isso, se comprometeu em ampliar o debate sobre a política monetária e prestar contas das decisões tomadas.\nO Banco Central foi criado para organizar e fortalecer o sistema financeiro do país. Ao longo desses 60 anos, enfrentou desafios, como um período de inflação muito elevada, passando de 100% nos anos 1980 para 6.700% pouco antes do Plano Real, que começou a ser implementado em 1990.\nEssa realidade demandou soluções de política monetária, como o próprio Plano Real, e de negociação da dívida externa, sem as quais o processo de estabilização da moeda brasileira não teria sido possível.\nHaddad diz que mundo está apreensivo com tarifaço de Trump\nRevista íntima humilhante em presídios é proibida pelo STF\nTrump anuncia tarifas de até 34% sobre produtos importados\nBusca por sobreviventes continua 5 dias após terremoto em Mianmar\nCelular Seguro: app enviará mensagem de alerta a celulares roubados",

    "text": "Location and setting are important for video games. They set the tone and guide choices like language and music. While some of the biggest and most popular are set in a dystopian future or feudal Japan, not many are set in a Russian convent in the late 18th century.\nIndika , developed by Odd Meter and published by 11 Bit Studios, was released on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on May 2. It is primarily narrative driven, meaning the player follows the flow of the story, rather than deciding what to do his or herself.\nThe lead character is the titular Indika, a young nun who has inner monologues and conversations with a voice inside her head. When the game starts, it is not clear who or what the voice is, or whether it’s inside her head or a malevolent power.\nAfter playing for some time, here’s a breakdown of the experience and why Indika might be worth trying.\nArthouse gaming In the game, players take control of the titular Indika, a young nun grappling with her beliefs. Photo: 11 Bit Studio On first impression, the most intriguing element is the artwork chosen for the cover and promotional materials. The poster shows veiled old women laughing maniacally at a young lady, accented with a yellow background.\nThe artwork is interesting because it seems to come straight out of Russian or Eastern European films from the 1950s or 60s. That would most certainly have been the intention from the makers.\nGaming covers and poster art usually quite straightforward. If the game is set in space, you can expect to see a spaceship battle or a man floating in zero gravity. If a game is set in on the streets of a metropolitan city, then the expectation is to see cars and guns and all manner of eccentric characters.\nIndika ’s artwork fits with the experience of playing the game. There are a number of left-field choices, like how the camera is utilised and what it’s focused on – techniques tried and true in cinema but rarely seen in gaming. These, as well as the eerie setting mixed with engrossing conversations on religion and the meaning of life, create a dense storytelling adventure.\nConventionally unconventional It is narrative-driven, so the gameplay is about enjoying the story rather than having much impact. That doesn’t mean you’re just watching a film play out while you input commands every now and then. Quite the contrary.\nREAD MORE The Saudi trailblazers on a levelling up mission for women in the gaming industry Indika does not contain one form of gameplay, it switches around from pixelated old-school-style levels to chore simulations. Some levels involve shifting into an alternate fractured universe with the only means to return to the real-world being prayer.\nThat being said, the different style changes are fun and keep things fresh, but none is particularly revolutionary. They are there to serve the main purpose – moving the story forward. Experienced on their own, they’re not special, but put together to form one game they result in a cool and singular experience.\nVerdict There’s so much innovation in gaming and it’s always nice to play a new and ground-breaking game that is making leaps in graphics or mechanics. Strength of story is what always keeps players coming back to though.\nIndika Developer: 11 Bit Studios\nPublisher: Odd Meter\nConsole: PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox series X/S\nRating: 4/5\nGames with great stories don’t always have to come from triple A studios either. Some of the best narrative game experiences have come from indie studios over the years. What Indika does well is mix up methods to service an interesting story.\nIt’s a mature game with mature themes. There are conversations and encounters that result in death and other that questioning the purpose in life. For adult gamers who want to play a game that doesn’t require too much input but still manages to be a fun and unusual experience, give Indika a try.\nUpdated: May 31, 2024, 6:02 PM Indika Developer: 11 Bit Studios\nPublisher: Odd Meter\nConsole: PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox series X/S\nRating: 4/5",
