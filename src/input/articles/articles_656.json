Es vital para suministrar agua limpia y secuestrar carbono; 6 de las 12 principales regiones hidrológicas de Brasil comienzan aquí, incluyendo el Pantanal, el humedal más grande del mundo. Este bioma contiene más de 10.000 especies de plantas, más de 1.200 aves y aproximadamente 400 especies de mamíferos. Además, nueve de cada diez brasileños utilizan electricidad generada por agua que proviene del Cerrado (World Wild Life, 2019). Las pérdida de la biodiversidad en los Bosques y Sabanas del Cerrado se debe al cambio de uso de suelo por la expansión de la agroindustria, la deficiente planificación territorial urbana y rural que desencadena en la construcción de infraestructura sin resguardos ambientales y genera la pérdida de hábitats y la fragmentación del paisaje, los conflictos de interés que limitan la protección de áreas con alto valor ecológico, la escasa infraestructura y regulación de tratamiento de aguas grises e industriales.

    "title": "Elon Musk implicates Microsoft and xAI in lawsuit against OpenAI",
    "text": "Elon Musk is now also naming Microsoft as a defendant in the lawsuit against OpenAI. The case deals with OpenAI’s commercial desires that, according to Musk, prevent it from having nonprofit interests.\nElon Musk’s [complaint ](https://www.techzine.eu/news/applications/117132/musk-sues-openai-and-its-ceo-sam-altman-for-abandoning-mission/)against OpenAI has been amended. Microsoft, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and former OpenAI board member Dee Templeton are among the new defendants.\nOpenAI and inseparable partner Microsoft\nTempleton served on the board as an untenured member of Microsoft, where she works as the VP of Partnerships and Operations. She resigned her seat on the board [during the summer of 2024](https://www.techzine.eu/news/privacy-compliance/122096/microsoft-abandons-observer-position-on-openai-board-of-directors/).\nThe two parties are closely linked by Microsoft’s huge financial contributions to OpenAI. Therefore, it is not remarkable that Musk wants to hear both sides of the duo in the lawsuit. In the complaint, his lawyers clarify that the partnership provides an unfair competitive advantage. After all, OpenAI can use Microsoft’s extensive infrastructure.\nNew plaintiffs\nNew plaintiffs are also popping up in the amendments. Also on that side is an old acquaintance of OpenAI’s board of directors: Shivon Zilis. Zilis has a personal relationship with Musk; together they have three children.\nIn the list of plaintiffs, Musk is keeping it remarkably close to home. In addition to Zilis, his own AI company xAI is also among them. This company develops the Grok models, which compete with OpenAI’s GPT models.\nAnother argument the lawyers have is the conspicuous demands OpenAI imposes on investors. About that, it came to light that the AI developer explicitly asks not to invest in competing AI companies. Since xAI is a competitor, the company experiences a direct negative impact.\nRead also: [OpenAI secures record funding with condition: no backing for Anthropic](https://www.techzine.eu/news/analytics/125000/openai-secures-record-funding-with-condition-no-backing-for-anthropic/)",

    "text": "BMKG Warns of Extreme Weather from Incoming Siberian Cold Surge During Year-End Holiday Reporter\nYudono Yanuar\nDecember 13, 2024 | 01:06 pm\nTEMPO.CO , Jakarta - The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency, or BMKG, warns of extreme rainfall during the Christmas and New Year holidays as influenced by the incoming cold surge from the Siberian highlands.\n\"When the [cold surge] lands in western Indonesia, namely West Java, Lampung, Banten, and Jakarta, the worst-case scenario is extreme downpours,” said BMKG Head Dwikorita Karnawati during a meeting with Commission V in Jakarta last Wednesday, December 4, 2024.\nCold surges may cause hydrometeorological disasters, like the floods in 2020. At the time, torrential downpour occurs during New Year’s Eve in Greater Jakarta, resulting in nine casualties in Jakarta, Bogor, and Depok.\nBMKG Head Dwikorita said the cold surge—which the weather agency detected the previous week—could trigger flooding in several regions, such as West Java, Lampung, Banten, and Jakarta.\nThe impact of a cold surge, such as increased rainfall and wind speed, will hit the archipelago from December 20 to 29.\n\"The [cold surge] has begun to move towards Indonesia in December and is expected to land here on December 20 to December 29,” she said, as quoted from Antara .\nIt is known that a cold surge is a weather phenomenon that occurs when atmospheric pressure rises higher compared to anticyclone movements or basins around it.\n\"The best-case scenario occurred two years ago, where docked ships rocked due to increased wind speed at Merak crossing,” she said.\nTo anticipate this worst impact, Dwikorita said her team continues to monitor the development of the cold surge.\nShe also requested cross-ministerial cooperation, such as the Ministry of Transportation, to anticipate the worst impact during the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays.\nA 20% Increase in Rainfall\nBMKG previously warned of extreme weather, in the form of a 20 percent increase in rainfall, to hit several regions during the year-end holidays.\n\"Extreme weather is predicted to potentially occur until March-April 2025, influenced by a weak La Nina phenomenon that can increase rainfall by 20 percent,\" said Dwikorita Karnawati in her statement through the BMKG website in Jakarta on Sunday, December 8, 2024.\nThe weather agency also forecast the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and Siberian cold surge to be active during the Christmas and New Year holiday periods.\nDwikorita stated that based on a survey conducted by the Ministry of Transportation, it is predicted that there will be 110.67 million people traveling during the year-end holiday season.\n\"The majority of travelers use private vehicles such as cars and motorcycles, making them highly vulnerable to facing extreme weather along their journey,\" she said.\nBMKG continues to closely monitor this condition and provides up-to-date information to support anticipatory measures and reduce field risks.\nShe stated that early weather warnings will be issued weekly and repeated three days before the weather event, even up to three hours before the extreme weather event.\nThe BMKG mobile application also offers a Digital Weather for Traffic (DWT) feature. This service can be used by travelers to check weather information during their travel.\n\"Users can access early warning information, the weather on land route, travel route, airport, port, and crossing, as well as information on flights and [high] waves,” she said.\nWeather Modification\nBMKG also mentioned that weather modification operations should be carried out to reduce the potential for heavy rain that could trigger disasters, such as floods, landslides, strong winds, and ground cracking in West Java.\nDwikorita explained that weather modification operations involve spreading sodium chloride (NaCl) or salt to potential clouds in southern West Java regions, such as Sukabumi Regency, Cianjur, Garut, Ciamis, Tasikmalaya, and Pangandaran, to southern Banten.\nA total of three tons of salt were successfully seeded into the air by joint personnel using a weather modification aircraft to reduce rain intensity, which could trigger hydrometeorological disasters in West Java.\nBNPB Head of Data, Information, and Disaster Communication Center Abdul Muhari, in a statement in Jakarta on Thursday, December 12, stated salt seeding was carried out in three Cessna Caravan 208B aircraft flights on Wednesday.\nThe target seeding area is potential rain clouds in the southwest to northwest of West Java, located at an altitude of 10,000-11,000 feet, or over three kilometers.\nThe weather modification operation team from BNPB, the Indonesian Air Force, and BMKG remain on standby at Halim Perdanakusuma Airbase to prepare subsequent seedings to several potential rain cloud zones based on weather satellite observations.\nEditor’s Choice: Flood, Landslide Displace 3,464 Residents in Sukabumi\nClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",

    "text": "Es una de las mañanas más mágicas del año. Al menos, la primera. Y es que la emoción de ver una alfombra de regalos bajo el árbol de Navidad es infinita. Y después de haber abierto todos los presentes, ¿qué mejor idea que sentarse a disfrutar de un gran desayuno? Alarga la magia del día Reyes vistiendo tu mesa para la ocasión y preparando un desayuno donde no puede faltar el Roscón de Reyes , dulces e incluso salados. ¿Y si haces un bufé? Como si de un hotel de cinco estrellas se tratase solo que mejor. Además del roscón de Reyes puedes preparar alguna otra tarta, servir croissants, magdalenas... Y para beber una buena taza de chocolate, un café humeante y aromático... Así cada uno podrá elegir lo que más le apetezca. Prepara galletas navideñas A los niños les encanta dejar un poco de comida para sus Majestades y bebida para los camellos. Puedes preparar la tarde anterior unas ricas galletas navideñas y guardar unas cuantas para el desayuno. Una mesa digna de para los reyes y las reinas de la casa Si en Navidad vistes la mesa para que luzca bonita ante toda la familia, hazlo también para desayunar el día de Reyes. Es un momento íntimo y muy familiar que bien vale la pena decorar como se merece. Un brunch para los más dormilones Aunque resulta (casi) imposible, si en casa convivimos con adolescentes puede que las sábanas se les peguen más y les cueste salir de la cama. Aunque también después de abrir los regalos, los niños se olvidan de cualquier tipo de comida y solo quieren jugar con sus regalos. Así que otra opción es preparar un brunch, es decir, un desayuno comida. Un roscón de Reyes No hace falta esperar a la comida para saborear un rico roscón de reyes. La torta más famosa del 6 de enero está deliciosa, sola, rellena o acompañada con un buen vaso de leche. Y nosotros tenemos la receta para hacer el mejor roscón de Reyes casero. Una mesa rústica, perfecta para el día de Reyes A los Reyes Magos y a los de la casa no les importa si tu estilo de decoración navideña es más tradicional, nórdica o minimalista. Por ejemplo, un comedor rústico que combina con los tradicionales rojos y el dorado de la luz junto a la calidez de la madera es perfecto para el desayuno del 6 de enero. Junto al árbol de Navidad, mucho mejor El árbol de Navidad es uno de los protagonistas de estas fechas. Muchos opinan que no hay Navidad sin árbol. Si tienes el árbol en el comedor, desayuna en familia en esa estancia o bien puedes decorar la cocina con un árbol mucho más pequeño de tamaño que presida la mesa del office. Ya verás cómo cambia el ambiente y lo hace aún más especial. Una taza de chocolate Un desayuno especial para un día especial. Un buen tazón de chocolate deshecho, ya sea con churros o con un poco de roscón de Reyes, les aportará energía para estar todo el día disfrutando de sus nuevos juguetes. Detalles que importan Llena la mesa de detalles como una figurita del belén, o una piña, o incluso una pequeña guirnalda...
