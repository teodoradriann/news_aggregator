    "text": "This is the Affordable, Renter-Friendly Way to Get Heated Floors\nindependentlyselect these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\nI’m always scouring the internet for home products that are not only useful but also\nunique and innovative. (It comes with the job territory.) But even so, it’s not often that I stumble across something I’ve never seen anything like before; usually, there are at least a few similar versions of the same thing that I’ve come across. Recently, however, I found an item that I had no idea was an option, but now that I know it exists, I need to get my hands on it immediately.\nMaybe I’ve been living under a rock, but I’ve never considered that there was such a thing as “an electric blanket for your floor,” but cold weather gear brand Cozy Winters is offering just that. That’s right: You can get heated floors for only a few hundred dollars, and their under-rug\nheated pad is entirely invisible and renter-friendly, too. If you’re just as intrigued as I was, let me give you all the details on why you need to snag this ingenious item for the chilly months ahead.\nWhat is the Portable Electric Radiant Floor Heating for Under Area Rugs?\nInstalling traditional heated floors will\ncost you at least a grand per room, if not several thousand dollars more, and needless to say, it’s completely out of the question if you’re renting. But Cozy Winters’ version only comes out to only a fraction of the price and its renter-friendly installation will save you a ton of time and effort. Their RugHeat pad is essentially a space heater that takes up zero space, sliding right under a rug.\nYou won’t even notice it’s there based on the feel — it’s only 1.3 millimeters thick — but the impact it’ll have on your room in the winter is far from small. After plugging the 8-foot cord into an outlet, the surface temperature will warm up to 75 to 80 degrees on average, but it’ll adjust to the room’s temperature. No more dealing with the discomfort of chilly floors, whether you decide to place it under your desk office, next to your bed, or even under your pet’s bed.\nThe RugHeat pad will even help you cut down your electric bill, since it costs “pennies a day to operate.” Most importantly, though, the brand (and reviewers) confirm that it’s entirely safe, regardless of what type of floors you have. (Yep, even carpet!) And, since I’m sure you’re all wondering: You can even use it in the bathroom because the material is water-proof (!).\nWhat Cozy Winters Reviewers are Saying\nAverage Rating: 4.9/5\n“We have an added room on our house that has a lot of windows, high ceilings, it’s on a slab, and is heated by a heat pump. So it’s cold, and even with the thermostat set at a decent temperature, still feels cold. I’m amazed at the difference that two of these make in that room. The floor feels warm (as expected), but it makes the entire room feel warmer as well. They really transform the entire room. If you’re in a similar situation, these make a huge difference.” – Jeff\n“I have put this off for a few years but I finally bought the unit a couple of weeks ago. It has definitely helped with the cold floors to sit and watch tv / read / hang out. I had a heat outage earlier this week and while it didn’t keep the room toasty, it certainly helped make it tolerable. If you have drafty floors, this is worth the money.” – Mark J.\n“I have had my Floor Heater for a number of weeks now. It is excellent! My home is in Maine and the parlor floor is damp and cold…a source of misery for my cats and hard on human feet. Since installing the heater I have turned down the thermostat and eliminated a portable heater. Cats are happy – humans also happy. Do not hesitate to purchase this item.” – Averil Johnson\nI was already almost sold just reading the product description — my drafty bedroom is unbearable in the winter — but the dozens of stellar reviews totally convinced me. The RugHeat pad can fit under a rug as small as 2’ by 3’ (which is only $175) or as large as 5.5’ by 8’. (You can even place two next to each other if you want to go larger.) Regardless of its size, though, this incredible item will make your space that much more cozy after being out in the freezing weather all day, which makes it a more than worthwhile investment.",

    "text": "Lécya participe à la saison 10 de The Voice Kids et va bientôt passer l'étape des battles. La jeune fille originaire des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence raconte son expérience et son quotidien à BFM DICI. \"Elle est dans la musique depuis qu’elle est dans le ventre de sa mère.\" Célia Salloum, ou de son nom de scène Lécya, participe à la saison 10 de The Voice Kids . Originaire de Mallefougasse-Augès dans les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, la jeune fille de 14 ans baigne dans la musique et le chant depuis toujours et n'en est pas à sa première scène.\nChez les Salloum, la musique c’est une véritable histoire de famille. \"Nous avions un groupe et on faisait beaucoup de concerts à l’époque\", se rappelle Jean-Charles, le papa de Célia.\nLe père de famille est musicien, la mère de Lécya chanteuse. \"J’ai toujours baigné dans ce milieu et je chante depuis toujours\", assure Célia auprès de BFM DICI. À 4 ans dans le salon de ses parents, Lécya prenait déjà le micro pour \"chanter du Louane\".\nCe n’est que quelques années plus tard, à l’âge de 10 ans qu’elle commence à prendre sérieusement des cours de chants, mais aussi à passer des concours. Plus tard, elle prend la décision avec sa mère de s'inscrire au concours télévisé de The Voice Kids .\nUn boost de notoriété Un événement qui a changé beaucoup de choses pour Célia, et qu’elle considère comme un tremplin. \"J’ai énormément appris en étant sur cette émission, autant sur le fait d’être sur un plateau télé que dans les techniques vocales\", confie la jeune fille.\nParticiper à un tel concours, veut aussi dire plus de notoriété. Actuellement élève en classe de troisième, Célia a déjà remarqué quelques changements autour d'elle.\n\"C’est vrai qu'au collège, on vient me voir pour me demander si c’est moi qui fait The Voice Kids, et les profs ont même organisé un mini-concours de chant\", raconte Célia à BFM DICI. Sur les réseaux sociaux, l'engouement se fait aussi ressentir. Sur Tiktok , où la jeune fille était déjà très active avec des vidéos de chant, son nombre d'abonnés est passé de 30.000 à presque 40.000 entre l'avant et après The Voice Kids.\nAvec déjà trois singles de sortis, plusieurs clips diffusés et des concerts de programmés, la jeune chanteuse ne compte pas s'arrêter à The Voice Kids. \"On veut monter un petit spectacle avec ses chansons, pour pouvoir proposer à des chanteurs en concert qu’elle fasse leurs premières parties\", ajoute son père.\nCélia veut surtout réaliser son rêve, et vivre de sa passion à fond. Rendez-vous samedi 21 septembre afin de savoir si Lécya poursuivra The Voice Kids l'aventure après l’étape des battles.\nJuliette Alberti Les plus lus\nDépression Kirk: jusqu'à quand vont durer les intempéries?",

    "title": "Even a redesigned Mac mini won’t be able to win me over | Digital Trends",
    "text": "There was a time when the Mac mini felt like the perfect Mac for me. Its compact frame was ideal for keeping my desk neat and uncluttered, while its M1 chip was miles better than the sluggish Intel processor in my 2015 MacBook Pro . Almost all my work was done from home, so I didn’t mind the lack of portability, while my MacBook handled things just fine on the road. But over time, my 2015 MacBook Pro slowed to a crawl and I eventually replaced it with a 14-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip. And that’s where the problems began (for the Mac mini, at least). Because after a couple years of use, I’m finding myself reaching for my MacBook Pro rather than my Mac mini almost every time — and I’m not sure even the upcoming Mac mini redesign can change that fact. In case you missed it, rumors have been swirling that Apple is planning to launch a revamped Mac mini in the next few months. This isn’t just any old tune-up — the Mac mini is expected to come with a new design that reduces its footprint to about the size of an Apple TV box , while slightly increasing its height in the process. It’ll be the first major design change for the Mac mini since 2010, right around the time the iPhone 4 initially went on sale. That has admittedly piqued my interest. After all, we’ve seen various claims over the years that a Mac mini redesign was in the works, but they’ve all come to nothing so far. Will this time be any different? And if it does actually come to fruition, will it be enough to convince me to upgrade? Or has the MacBook Pro forever dented my enthusiasm for Apple’s smallest desktop Mac? Overcoming the MacBook Pro Aside from the new design, the next Mac mini is expected to get a chip upgrade to the Apple M4 series . There are rumored to be two models in the works, one with an M4 chip and another bearing the M4 Pro. Other than that, though, there aren’t expected to be too many other changes. While the new chips sound intriguing — especially the M4 Pro, which would help with the game reviews that are a part of my work — I’m not sure that they’re enough to convince me to pull the trigger. And that’s because even the new Mac mini’s smaller size still won’t help it overcome the MacBook Pro’s trump card: portability. Sure, the Mac mini itself is highly portable. It’s the smallest Mac you can get for your desktop, and I find it’s easy to slip inside a backpack when I’m on the go. But using a Mac mini requires more than just the computer itself — you need a power cord, a keyboard, a mouse, and a display, too. And lugging around a desktop monitor is not exactly my definition of convenient. The Mac mini doesn’t really have much of an advantage for me at home either, since I can easily connect my MacBook Pro to a monitor and use it like a desktop Mac. For me at least, the MacBook Pro has the upper hand. Should you buy the Mac mini? That’s not to say there’s no reason at all to buy a Mac mini. One of its primary strengths is its price – starting at $599, it’s the cheapest Mac by some $400 and is a full $1,000 less expensive than the most affordable MacBook Pro. That’s a massive savings and it still nets you an excellent little computer. If Apple can keep the price of the new model low, that alone will be an excellent reason to buy it. Add in the reduced footprint, new looks, and faster chips and it could be a tempting prospect for a lot of people. I’m just not sure I’m one of those people anymore. My M1 Mac mini has served me really well over the years, but it just can’t match the MacBook Pro’s combination of power and portability. The new model, as good as it could be, is unlikely to change that for me.",

    "text": "Filha do Tom Cruise e Katie Holmes completa 18 anos; veja curiosidades sobre ela Da origem de seu nome até o tempo que está sem falar com seu pai, saiba mais sobre Suri Cruise Suri Cruise, fruto do relacionamento entre Tom Cruise e Katie Holmes, completa 18 anos nesta quinta-feira (18). Já considerada uma das crianças mais famosas dos EUA, hoje, a jovem mantém uma vida discreta e afastada de seu pai. Ainda que tenha crescido em meio ao mundo dos famosos e se tornando uma grande influência na moda, Suri faz poucas aparições públicas, tendo registros atuais feitos apenas por paparazzi. Confira algumas curiosidades sobre Suri Cruise Origem do nome De origem persa, o nome Suri significa “princesa” ou “vermelho”. Em hebraico, também é relacionado à “princesa”. Capa de revista Desde seu nascimento, a mídia sempre esteve de olho em Suri. Por conta disso, em 2006, ano de seu nascimento, a jovem se tornou capa da Vanity Fair e foi considerada a bebê mais famosa dos EUA. Seis anos depois, Suri ainda foi eleita a criança mais elegante do mundo pelo site britânico Twisted Twee. Longe dos holofotes Apesar de ter uma infância marcada pelos holofotes, conforme foi crescendo, Suri decidiu se afastar completamente deste universo. Com a ajuda de Katie Holmes, sua mãe, a jovem conseguiu manter uma vida discreta e, hoje, não possui nem mesmo redes sociais. Distância familiar Filha de um dos maiores atores de Hollywood, de acordo com a mídia internacional, Suri não mantém contato com Tom Cruise desde 2012, quando o casamento do artista com Katie Holmes chegou ao fim. Na época, o ator admitiu que seu envolvimento com a Cientologia motivou o afastamento de sua família. Valor da pensão Segundo informações do [The Daily Mail,](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2192977/Katie-Holmes-receives-just-400-000-year-child-support-payments-Tom-Cruise.html) Tom Cruise teve de pagar uma pensão anual equivalente a R$ 2,1 milhões para a filha até os seus 18 anos — ainda que não se falem. Hobbies e faculdade Ainda que não demonstre interesse pela fama, Suri não pode negar sua veia artística. Durante a pandemia, a filha de Katie Holmes desenvolveu suas habilidades para costura, pintura e escrita. Sempre com o apoio de sua mãe, fontes próximas a jovem afirmaram ao [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13325131/Katie-Holmes-looks-effortlessly-stylish-makes-final-preparations-daughter-Suris-18th-birthday-estranged-father-Tom-Cruise-seen.html) que ela cogita cursar Moda na faculdade.",

Cela signifie, par exemple, qu’une personne qui a obtenu un diplôme de bachelier travaille également à ce niveau. Pour deux personnes sur dix, le niveau d’éducation est supérieur à celui requis pour l’emploi. Près d’une personne sur dix présente par ailleurs un niveau d’éducation inférieur à celui requis.\nParmi les personnes avec un niveau d’éducation élevé, près de 80% déclarent que leur niveau d’éducation correspond à ce qui est requis pour leur emploi. Près de 17% d’entre elles se disent cependant surqualifiées. Chez les personnes ayant un niveau d’éducation faible ou moyen, ce pourcentage de surqualification se fixe respectivement à 20,9 et 24,5%. De manière générale, il y a donc moins d’adéquation entre le niveau d’éducation requis pour un emploi et celui atteint par les personnes ayant un niveau d’éducation plus faible.\nLa concordance est également plus grande parmi les personnes occupées que parmi les personnes inactives et les chômeurs. En outre, plus la durée de l’emploi est longue, moins il y a d’inadéquation. Seulement 66% des personnes employées depuis moins d’un an exercent une fonction en adéquation avec leur niveau d’étude, alors que ce chiffre monte à 79,6% pour les personnes qui travaillent pour un même employeur depuis plus de cinq ans. Par ailleurs, les femmes sont plus souvent surqualifiées que les hommes.\nConcernant l’adéquation entre diplôme et emploi, six personnes sur dix déclarent un haut degré d’adéquation. Seize pourcents présentent un certain degré d’adéquation, près de 10% n’ont pratiquement aucune adéquation et 11,2% n’ont aucune adéquation.\nLa rédaction",
