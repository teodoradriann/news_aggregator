    "text": "Recently, videos circulated online that appeared to show Los Angeles engulfed in chaos: Marines clashing with protesters, cars ablaze, pallets of bricks staged for violence. The implication was clear, the city had been overtaken by insurrectionists.\nThe reality was far more contained. Much of the footage was either old, unrelated, or entirely misrepresented. A photo from a Malaysian construction site became “evidence” of a Soros-backed plot. Even a years-old video of burning police cars resurfaced with a new, false label.\nThis is the oldest trick in the misinformation playbook, and we see it in almost every big breaking news cycle. Use what’s real to distort what’s true. Today, it’s happening faster, fooling more people, and making verification more critical than ever. In our newsroom, we call it the context gap: the space between what a video depicts and what a viewer is led to believe. It’s widening and with it, public trust is eroding.\nAuthentic, yet misleading\nMany assume misinformation requires special effects or technical sophistication. In reality, much of it requires only timing, intent, and a caption.\nTake the example of footage of President Zelensky signing artillery shells. The video was genuine, filmed at a U.S. factory during a 2024 visit. It later resurfaced with captions falsely claiming the shells were destined for Israel. No editing was necessary. The clip looked real, because it was. The framing alone changed the meaning.\nThis is what makes miscontextualized video so effective. It exploits our instinct to trust what we can see. Viewers may never question the footage, let alone realize they’ve been misled. In some cases, the false framing is intentional, what we call disinformation. In others, the content is shared by people who believe it to be true, that’s misinformation. Whether the deception is deliberate or accidental, the impact is the same: a public less certain of what to trust.\nThe real danger is not just deception, it’s assumption. When authentic content is misused without warning, it reinforces false narratives while bypassing skepticism entirely. The result isn’t just confusion. It’s confidence in the wrong conclusion.\nThis kind of manipulation shapes perception in ways that are hard to reverse. Even when corrections are issued later, the original framing often sticks, driving division, fueling misinformation cycles, and distorting how people understand events around the world.\nCountering that kind of influence requires more than detection software or fact-checking. It requires a shift in mindset: a habit of slowing down, asking questions, and interrogating the frame, not just the footage. In journalism, we call that constructive skepticism, and right now, we need more of it, beyond the newsroom.\nJournalistic habits, public value\nJournalists are trained to question, verify, and triangulate. Verification is not simply a task, it is a mindset. In our newsroom, this means identifying the original upload, analyzing metadata, and confirming time and place through visual context.\nCentral to that process is skepticism, not as cynicism, but as discipline. Journalistic skepticism means refusing to take visual evidence at face value. It means asking who benefits, what might be missing just outside the frame, and whether a clip has appeared before under a different guise. It’s not about doubting everything. It’s about demanding enough proof to support trust. These practices may be out of reach for most people. Yet the principles behind them are not.\nSkepticism, when grounded in evidence, is one of journalism’s most valuable tools. Applied more widely, it can help the public navigate the flood of video and imagery without falling into conspiracy or confusion.\nAnyone can adopt a more careful, skeptical approach by asking a few basic questions: Does this look like what it claims to be? Is the source credible or recognizable? Have I seen this before in a different context? These simple checks do not require technical expertise. A moment of hesitation, scaled across a viewing public, could have changed how the wildfire or Zelensky clips were received and shared.\nWe do not need every viewer to become a verification expert. What we need is a shift in mindset: toward curiosity, caution, and context.\nThe context gap is widening\nJournalists must continue to treat visual content as seriously as any other source, verifying not just whether something is real, but when and where it was captured, who posted it, and whether it is being presented truthfully.\nHowever, the responsibility does not end there.\nPlatforms also have a role to play. When old or previously viral footage resurfaces during breaking news, platforms should add the necessary context proactively, not just rely on users to act as de facto fact-checkers. Many major platforms already have content detection systems in place to catch copyright infringements.\nThe public must also be equipped to pause, question, and seek clarity. Educators and institutions can help foster these habits of verification alongside broader digital access. One of the most overlooked tools in fighting misinformation is not software, but curriculum, training people to interpret the media landscape around them.\nWe live in an age when anyone can broadcast to the world, with algorithms built to capture and keep attention regardless of veracity or intent. The context gap is not narrowing. It is widening. Every swipe, share, and caption now plays a role in shaping how we see the world—and how others see it too. Slowing down to ask “why this, why now?” may be one of the most powerful tools we have.\nJames Law is the editor-in-chief at Storyful.",

Manasseh Maelanga, Minister for Infrastructure Development, presenting instruments of accession to Mr. Arsenio Antonio Dominguez Velasco, IMO Secretary-General Solomon Islands made a groundbreaking step in acceding to eight (8) conventions and protocols related to marine and air pollution at the occasion of the 82nd session of the Marine Pollution Environment Committee (MEPC 82) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London, UK from 30th September to 4th October 2024. The delegation was led by the Honourable Manasseh Maelanga, Minister for Infrastructure Development and accompanied by his Permanent Secretary Mr Allan Lilia, H.E. Mr. Moses Kouni Mose, Ambassador to the European Union and senior officers and experts from the Solomon Islands Maritime Authority (SIMA). Minister Maelanga congratulated Mr Arsenio Antonio Dominguez Velasco from Panama on his appointment in January 2024 as the new Secretary-General of the IMO. Minister Maelanga assured him of Solomon Islands support in his leadership of the Organisation in advancing the interests and priorities of members in the maritime sector. The eight (8) conventions and protocols that Solomon Islands has ratified and deposited with IMO will commit the government to strengthen the maritime legislative framework in the country to prevent marine pollution and to facilitate, internal responses and international cooperation in addressing major oil pollution from ships. Minister Maelanga presented to IMO Secretary-General the instrument of accession to the 1997 Protocol of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). This protocol introduced a new annex to MARPOL on the prevention of air pollution from ships setting limits on emissions from ship and adopting measures to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In his statement at the meeting, Minister Maelanga re-iterated the devastating impacts of climate change to small island developing states in the Pacific and called on the IMO and its members to urgently agree on measures for the shipping industry to transition into efficient fuel sources and green energy and to reduce GHG emissions. He also supported the proposal by six Pacific Islands Countries (Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu) and Seychelles for the imposition of a fuel levy on ships as source of revenue to support in a just and equitable energy transition of shipping and climate change mitigation. The Minister further stated the transition must serve our vision, ambition and strategy set out in our Plan for a Sustainable Maritime Future developed by SIMA in collaboration with IMO and support of the GreenVoyage2050 project. Solomon Islands calls on international partners to join efforts in supporting the Pacific Islands region to develop and implement the Pacific One-Maritime Framework (POMF), our collective vision of safe and secure, green, clean and digital shipping and port in the Pacific.

    "text": "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. – John 3:16-17 In our world, people live according to their financial status. Those who have wealth enjoy the best of life. They live in beautiful homes, drive fancy and expensive cars, travel first class or in their own special aircraft. They eat in the most expensive restaurants and afford themselves the most luxurious pleasures of life. Then there are those who are not so wealthy, but they also live well. Their homes are comfortable, and their automobiles are upscale. They, too, can travel around the world because they have the means. There are those who do not have the means to live well or in very comfortable homes. They drive used automobiles if they can afford one. They travel and take vacation by means of credit. Eating out is done in less expensive restaurants. Even though, according to human standards, these groups are noticeably different, in the eyes of God they are the same. God does not see class structure, or economic difference. To him, they are all the same. They all live in a world of sin and woe and are perishing. They all need a savior. That is why God, out of pure love, sent his beloved son into the world to die for us, that we do not perish. The above text emphasizes that God loves us unconditionally. He has demonstrated His love through the person and work of the Son, Jesus the Christ. When we are brought into the kingdom through the power of the Holy Spirit, we have a change of heart. We come to love God as our father. The Holy Spirit gives us a spiritual birth. The father sent the Son, who died for us. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all work for the common goal of saving us from our sins and granting us eternal life. When we are reborn by God through faith, we become God’s children. We receive his blessing through Christ’s work on the cross. God’s love is in our salvation which comes through Jesus Christ the son. God the father sacrificed his son for us. The love of God is without bounds. It is the greatest love we humans have ever experienced. There is no question about God’s love for us. The promise of eternal life is real and unmistakable. Those who search for God will realize that God cared enough to send the very best, His own son to make our salvation possible and complete. God’s unlimited offer of salvation is seen in the above text. God wishes to reform our lives, give us direction, lead us in the way of salvation and remind us often of the forgiveness of our sins and eternal life. He won that for us through his unconditional love which is found in the bruises and scars of his beloved son. God is the author of love and mercy. His storehouse never runs out.

    "text": "Arshdeep Singh could be handy customer in SA: Ravi Shastri wants left-arm pacer to be in mix for Test squad\nFormer India coach Ravi Shastri believes left-arm pacer Arsheep Singh could be a valuable asset for India in Test cricket, especially in overseas conditions. Shastri made these remarks after the Indian bowler’s poor performance in an innings defeat to South Africa in the Boxing Day Test.\nArshdeep’s ability to swing the ball is particularly noteworthy. He has demonstrated this skill effectively, swinging the new ball away from right-handers rather than just slanting it across. This talent was on full display during his stint in South Africa, where he showcased his skills with the white ball. His performance in the ODI series against South Africa was remarkable, as he managed to take five wickets for 37 runs in Johannesburg on December 17, 2023.\n“Two bowlers were decently experienced – Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. But then, they missed Shami big time in this Test match. Yes, Shardul has experience. He (Shardul) is not a baby, but he is not the third seamer. You need a proper third seamer in overseas conditions,” Ravi Shastri said while speaking on Star Sports.\nShastri has emphasized the importance of Arshdeep’s first-class record when considering him for the Test squad. Arshdeep has played 12 first-class matches, taking 38 wickets with an average of 29.97 and an economy rate of 3.12. He has also shown the capability to bowl long spells, which is crucial for Test cricket. In fact, earlier in 2023, Arshdeep signed with Kent to play five County Championship games, indicating his commitment to improving his ability to bowl long spells.\n“The fact is, you have to see his (Arshdeep’s) first-class record. Can he bowl long spells? Has he played a lot of Ranji Trophy cricket? I would, in fact, make him go and play a lot of Ranji Trophy cricket. Frist-class cricket. I would keep him in the mix because if someone can swing tt, like he did with the white-ball in South Africa, he could be a handy customer here,” Shastri added.\nWatch Live TV in English\nWatch Live TV in Hindi",

    "text": "Climatología / Ciencias de la Tierra\nConfirmado: la Tierra se está calentado al ritmo más rápido jamás registrado\nA pesar de esto, se prevé que 2025 sea algo más frío, debido al fenómeno de “La Niña” en el Océano Pacífico tropical\nPablo Javier Piacente\n2023 y 2024 fueron los años más cálidos en los registros que se remontan a mediados del siglo XIX, y estarán cerca de 1,5 grados Celsius por encima de la temperatura de la era industrial temprana. Mientras el mundo tardó un siglo en elevar su temperatura por encima de 0,3 grados Celsius, se ha calentado por el contrario hasta un grado Celsius solamente en los últimos 60 años, a partir del frenético incremento en las emisiones contaminantes y el ritmo de presión humana sobre el ambiente.\nEl científico Edward Hawkins, de la Universidad de Reading, en el Reino Unido, analiza en un [artículo](https://theconversation.com/cop29-how-fast-is-earth-warming-244093) publicado recientemente en The Conversation los principales datos históricos y actuales sobre el calentamiento global, en el marco de [COP29](https://cop29.az/en/home), la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático que termina hoy en la ciudad de Bakú, capital de Azerbaiyán. El investigador desarrolla una serie de argumentos que permiten concluir que el planeta se está calentando al ritmo más intenso que ha logrado registrarse hasta el momento.\nLos inicios de las investigaciones\nEn principio, Hawkins recuerda que sobre 1933, al examinar las tendencias en las temperaturas medidas en muchos lugares diferentes de todo el mundo, el meteorólogo estadounidense Joseph Kincer concluyó que el planeta se estaba calentando, pero no sugirió una razón. Posteriormente, en 1938 el ingeniero británico Guy Callendar mostró que las temperaturas globales se habían incrementado en aproximadamente 0,3 grados Celsius en los últimos 50 años.\nEn este caso, Callendar argumentó que este calentamiento se debió en gran medida al aumento de los niveles de dióxido de carbono en la atmósfera por la quema de carbón, basándose en teorías anteriores del efecto invernadero. A partir de estos primeros indicios se incrementaron y profundizaron los estudios sobre el cambio climático y el [calentamiento global](https://www.levante-emv.com/tendencias21/2024/06/06/calentamiento-global-alcanza-maximos-historicos-103417402.html) incentivados por la actividad humana, hasta llegar al extenso corpus teórico sobre el tema que existe actualmente, y que continúa expandiéndose.\nLos años más cálidos\nAhora, Hawkins indica que los datos actuales y todos estos estudios previos son más que claros: el ritmo de incremento de las temperaturas es el mayor que se ha registrado hasta hoy. Por ejemplo, menciona que 2023 y 2024 alcanzarán los niveles más altos de calentamiento global en mediciones que se remontan hasta 1850, y que al mismo tiempo se ubicarán 1,5 grados Celsius por encima de los registros térmicos de la era industrial temprana.\nAdemás, sostiene que tuvo que pasar un siglo para que el planeta incrementara sus temperaturas en 0,3 grados Celsius, pero que solamente en las últimas seis décadas se concretó un aumento que llegó hasta 1 grado Celsius. Aunque el incremento no es uniforme en todo el planeta y ha registrado distintos ritmos, Hawkins muestra que la Tierra está sometida a una presión antropogénica que intensifica las condiciones naturales del cambio climático.\nLa tasa de [calentamiento global](https://www.levante-emv.com/tendencias21/2024/09/04/calentamiento-global-enterrando-enormes-cantidades-107743591.html) se ha ubicado en 0,2 grados Celsius por década desde 1970 hasta ahora, mucho más rápido que cualquier otro período anterior. Los últimos dos años podrían sugerir que la tasa se está acelerando aún más, aunque esto no puede afirmarse con certeza todavía. Aunque el calor persistente durante los últimos dos años parecería indicar lo contrario, es más probable que 2025 sea más frío que 2024, dada la transición a las condiciones de “La Niña” en el Océano Pacífico tropical. Sin embargo, Hawkins cree que superaremos los 1,5 grados Celsius de calentamiento como promedio a largo plazo, en algún momento de la próxima década.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Confirmado%3A%20la%20Tierra%20se%20est%C3%A1%20calentado%20al%20ritmo%20m%C3%A1s%20r%C3%A1pido%20jam%C3%A1s%20registrado%20https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/tendencias21/2024/11/22/confirmado-tierra-calentado-ritmo-rapido-111945307.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/tendencias21/2024/11/22/confirmado-tierra-calentado-ritmo-rapido-111945307.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/tendencias21/2024/11/22/confirmado-tierra-calentado-ritmo-rapido-111945307.html&text=Confirmado%3A%20la%20Tierra%20se%20est%C3%A1%20calentado%20al%20ritmo%20m%C3%A1s%20r%C3%A1pido%20jam%C3%A1s%20registrado%20%20https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/tendencias21/2024/11/22/confirmado-tierra-calentado-ritmo-rapido-111945307.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40diariolaopinion)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=Confirmado%3A%20la%20Tierra%20se%20est%C3%A1%20calentado%20al%20ritmo%20m%C3%A1s%20r%C3%A1pido%20jam%C3%A1s%20registrado%20&body=https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/tendencias21/2024/11/22/confirmado-tierra-calentado-ritmo-rapido-111945307.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil\n[De 'Supervivientes' y 'Gran Hermano' a un Psiquiátrico en Murcia: sale a la luz el paradero de la estrella de Telecinco](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/ocio/tv/2024/11/21/supervivientes-hospital-psiquiatrico-murcia-sale-dv-111894811.html)[Maite Galdeano deja Murcia y confirma la reconciliación: \"Solo hay una](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/ocio/tv/2024/11/21/maite-galdeano-deja-murcia-confirma-dv-111894968.html)[Este es el desorbitado precio del refugio de 60 metros de Maite Galdeano en Murcia: 'Primera línea](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/economia/2024/11/21/desorbitado-precio-refugio-60-metros-dv-111896068.html)[La trama de la bolsa de trabajo del SMS implica a altos funcionarios](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/comunidad/2024/11/22/trama-bolsa-trabajo-sms-implica-111923668.html)[Adiós a Jorge Javier Vázquez: Mediaset toma la decisión y prescinde del presentador tras lo ocurrido](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/ocio/tv/2024/11/19/adios-jorge-javier-vazquez-mediaset-dv-111831944.html)[Críticas al Ayuntamiento de Murcia por no ayudar a un grupo de bomberos voluntarios en la DANA](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/murcia/2024/11/21/criticas-ayuntamiento-murcia-ayudar-grupo-111884908.html)[Buenas noticias para los murcianos: si están en esta lista reciben la ayuda de hasta 373,17€](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/economia/2024/11/19/buenas-noticias-murcianos-lista-reciben-dv-111824949.html)[La borrasca Caetano pondrá en alerta a la Región este jueves por fuertes vientos](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/comunidad/2024/11/21/borrasca-caetano-murcia-viento-aviso-111861055.html)",

    "text": "The number of young people out of work due to long-term sickness has doubled since 2010, figures show. The Tories are “writing off” young people, Labour has said, with the number of young people out of work due to “long-term sickness” doubling since 2010. Sir Keir Starmer’s party said that in 2010/11, there were 116,000 16 to 24-year-olds out of work or not looking for employment due to long-term sickness. The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for the whole of the UK now puts this number at 235,000 people out of work, the party said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: “By neglecting the foundations needed for a healthy economy, the Tories are writing off hundreds of thousands of young people.” The Labour MP said her party would ensure young people do not fall between the cracks between services and Government departments. It hopes that improving mental health services, as well as reducing NHS waiting lists and strengthening workers’ rights, will help tackle the “root causes” of economic inactivity. Ms Kendall said: “Labour will tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, including the mental health crisis facing so many of our young people. “We will transform mental health services, drive down NHS waiting lists, boost skills, bolster employment rights and provide tailored job support.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride have both sought to get people of all ages back into the workplace, in a bid to boost labour supply across the UK. The proportion of people out of work rose since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, but the issue is also seen to be caused by a broader set of factors including rising disability and long-term sickness levels. A Government spokesperson said: “We are driving down inactivity and helping young people into work as we build on our track record of youth unemployment falling by 43% since 2010. “We are investing £2.3 billion into mental health services and supporting more 16 and 17-year-olds to participate in education and apprenticeships. “More widely our Back to Work Plan will help up to 1.1 million people with long-term health conditions, disabilities or long-term unemployed to look for and stay in work.” A Conservative spokesman accused Labour of having a “brass neck”, saying the party had “never left office with unemployment lower than what they inherited”.",
