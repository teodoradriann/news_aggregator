    "title": "Recovery efforts underway in Ruidoso as residents sift through valuables",
    "text": "Recovery efforts began in Ruidoso on Wednesday following Tuesday's deadly flash flooding, which decimated the area. At a mobile home park in Gavilan Canyon, many residents returned to homes that had been destroyed - floors caked in a layer of thick mud, doorsteps piled high with debris, and some homes swept clean off their foundations. \\\"This was my cousin's house. And we don't know where it is,\\\" said resident Darlene Apachito. Many were frightened by the impending floodwaters when warnings were issued on Tuesday, so they moved out of the way. \\\"We left like 30 minutes early because I said, 'We better leave. Look what happened in Texas. We don't know this time,' I said. So we left,\\\" said Apachito. For others, it was a helpless feeling, knowing they could not do anything to stop the raging waters. \\\"I was actually across from the links the golf course and I ended up getting stranded there because the water just came so fast it was all over the road. We didn't know what to do and there was no way we could help,\\\" said another resident, Alexx Chavez. Volunteers were also out in full force Wednesday, helping residents pick up the pieces. \\\"I'm really happy that the community came out here and started helping people who live in poverty and trailer parks because it's hard, it's hard working from day to day and losing everything all at once,\\\" said Gisselle Villareal, a volunteer in Ruidoso. One volunteer described the community's response: \\\"We had essentially a search party, going on throughout the whole town, just to see who or what could be possibly in danger.\\\" Another volunteer expressed the importance of community support, saying, \\\"I'm just trying to take the frowns off of peoples faces by giving them a cold water, a bear hug, and giving back to our community, we always do, and we always will.\\\" Rain was not an issue for Ruidoso on Wednesday; however, with chances for storms remaining in the forecast for much of the week, and with much of monsoon season still ahead, the flood threat looms. Many say that because of this impending threat, they do not want to stay. \\\"I just feel like the whole trailer park should get rid of-- I don't-- there's no more for us to be living here. Like, we're in danger,\\\" said Moraima Aguirre, a Ruidoso resident. \\\"We should have moved the first time, but we didn't, but now this one is scary,\\\" said Apachito.

    "text": "„Geschmacklos“: Müller-Produkt stößt Kundin auf – Drogeriemarkt zieht Konsequenzen\nEine Müller-Kundin findet ein anzügliches Modellbau-Set in der Spielwarenabteilung. Der Drogeriemarkt reagiert prompt. Auch der Hersteller äußert sich.\nMünchen – Ein unscheinbares Modellbau-Set erregt aktuell viel Aufsehen: Das Figuren-Set „Voyeure“ der Firma NOCH aus Wangen im Allgäu zeigt halbnackte Frauen, einen Mann mit Fernglas – und ein Kind, das sich die Augen zuhält. Es ist Teil einer Produktreihe für Modelleisenbahn-Landschaften. Das eigentlich unauffällige Set aus dem Standardsortiment wurde zum Zentrum einer hitzigen Debatte über Geschmack, Ethik und die Grenzen der Miniaturdarstellung.\nAuslöser für den Wirbel war eine Beschwerde: Christine B. entdeckte das Set in der Spielwarenabteilung einer Müller-Filiale in München. Gegenüber Bild kritisierte sie: „Hier wird Voyeurismus verharmlost und Kindern als harmlose Unterhaltung vermittelt.“ Für sie sei das „nicht nur geschmacklos, sondern auch höchst verantwortungslos.“\nFiguren-Set verschwindet nach Beschwerde von Kundin aus dem Müller-Sortiment\nDer Drogeriemarkt Müller reagierte prompt. Ein Sprecher des Unternehmens erklärte gegenüber der BILD-Zeitung: „Beim Handelskonzern Müller legen wir größten Wert auf ein verantwortungsvolles und familienfreundliches Sortiment. […] Die betreffenden Artikel wurden umgehend entfernt.“ Man bedaure den Vorfall sehr und prüfe derzeit, wie ähnliche Fehler in Zukunft vermieden werden könnten. Das Figuren-Set ist mittlerweile aus dem Sortiment und Online-Handel entfernt worden.\nDie Firma Noch GmbH, ein traditionsreiches Familienunternehmen mit 114-jähriger Geschichte und europäischer Marktführerschaft im Bereich Modellbauzubehör, zeigt sich angesichts der Empörung gelassen. Geschäftsführer Rainer Noch erklärte gegenüber dem SWR: „Die Verkaufszahlen haben am Dienstagmorgen schon deutlich angezogen.“ Er rechne damit, dass das Set bald ausverkauft sein werde. Dass gerade dieses Figuren-Set für Diskussionen sorgt, verwundert Noch: „Die Realität kennt keine Tabus, und um ein wirklichkeitsnahes Abbild zu schaffen, ist es notwendig, auch jene Aspekte darzustellen, die zum menschlichen Leben gehören.“ Das Set sei seit Jahren im Sortiment und habe bislang kaum Kritik ausgelöst.\nHersteller äußert sich: „Wir wollen das Leben in all seinen Facetten darstellen“\nDas Set „Voyeure“ ist Teil einer Linie von Miniaturfiguren, mit denen Noch laut eigener Website „humorvolle oder ungewöhnliche Szenen“ darstellen will. Im Online-Shop wird es als geeignet für „erotische Szenen in Ihrer Modelllandschaftsgestaltung“ beworben. Die Figuren sind übliche Miniaturfiguren, wie man sie zum Beispiel aus dem Miniaturwunderland in Hamburg kennt. Während kritische Stimmen, wie die von Christine B., das Set als sexualisierte Darstellung mit problematischer Botschaft einstufen, betont der Hersteller seine künstlerische und realitätsnahe Freiheit. „Wir wollen das Leben in all seinen Facetten darstellen,“ sagte Rainer Noch gegenüber dem SWR.\nDie Aufmerksamkeit ist für das Unternehmen aus dem Allgäu offenbar kein Nachteil. Bereits auf der Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg präsentierte die Noch GmbH eine neue Linie namens „Funny-Scenes“, die Sets mit Bezeichnungen wie „Saufbrüder“, „Seitensprung“ oder „Straßenstrich“ umfasst. Diese sollen ab Oktober im Handel erhältlich sein. Das, was der eine lustig findet, dem anderen sauer aufstößt, ist keine Seltenheit. So erhiet etwa auch ein Mafia-Brettspiel heftigen Gegenwind.

    "title": "«True Detective», saison 4, est inspirée de faits réels effroyables | Slate.fr",
    "text": "Temps de lecture: 6 minutes Attention: cet article comporte des spoilers. Blocs de viandes durcis par le froid polaire, les corps de huit scientifiques sont retrouvés dans la neige. Leurs visages sont figés dans une expression de [terreur](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/11617/terreur) absolue, leurs mains ressemblent à des griffes d'oiseaux qui se battent pour leur survie. Ce tableau macabre est au cœur de la saison 4 de True Detective, logée dans une Alaska hivernale sur laquelle le soleil ne se lève pas pendant des semaines. Dans la [série](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/3353/series-televisees), un élément surnaturel est instillé dès le premier épisode: c'est le fantôme d'un personnage qui indique à une de ses proches comment retrouver la piste des scientifiques qui ont disparu d'une base de recherche arctique quelques heures plus tôt. Mais ce n'est pas ça qui fait le plus peur. Au début du deuxième épisode, le personnage principal, campé par Jodie Foster, époussette les défunts afin de les identifier. Son coéquipier et elle observent un petit catalogue d' [horreurs](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/2641/horreur): cornées brûlées, tympans explosés, yeux arrachés. Et des corps morts entièrement nus. Ce qui donne encore plus de frissons, c'est qu'autant de [cadavres](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/21961/cadavres) aient été retrouvés dans des circonstances similaires dans le monde réel. C'était en février 1959, au fin fond de l'Oural, lors d'un événement connu sous le nom d'«affaire du col Dyatlov». La langue et les yeux Le 23 janvier 1959, neuf randonneurs chevronnés, étudiants à l'Institut de polytechnique de l'Oural, prennent un train à Iekaterinbourg en direction d'Ivdel, dans l'oblast de Sverdlovsk. Leur leader s'appelle Igor Dyatlov. Après un voyage en camion et une nuit dans le village de Vizhai, ils partent pour une [randonnée](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/24117/randonnee) qui ressemble plus à une expédition vers le mont Otorten. Malade, un des étudiants fait demi-tour le 28 janvier. Le 12 février au plus tard, le groupe est censé envoyer un télégramme annonçant son retour une fois arrivé à Vizhai. Le 13, aucune nouvelle n'ayant été donnée, une équipe de secours est lancée à leur recherche. «Ce qu'ils ont trouvé sur place est devenu l'origine d'un des plus grands mystères du XXe siècle, estime l'Américain Donnie Eichar, auteur de Dead Mountain – The Untold True Story of the Dyatlov Pass Incident («La Montagne morte – L'histoire vraie et inédite de l'affaire du col Dyatlov», en français). Leur tente avait été déchirée depuis l'intérieur. Leurs affaires étaient encore là. Mais pas eux.» Progressant péniblement dans la neige, l'équipe de secours suit des traces de pas. Elles ont l'air d'avoir été laissées par des pieds vêtus d'une seule chaussure, de chaussettes ou carrément nus, et semblent converger vers un bois situé à 1,5 kilomètre du camp. C'est là, sous un grand pin de Sibérie, près des restes d'un feu de camp, que les deux premiers [corps](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/61/corps) sont retrouvés. «Aucun des randonneurs n'était assez couvert, poursuit Donnie Eichar. Il avait beau faire au moins -25°C, certains ne portaient pas de chaussettes, voire pas d'habits.» À 5 mètres de hauteur, des branches du grand pin sont brisées. Certains suggèrent que les randonneurs ont escaladé l'arbre dans l'espoir d'apercevoir leur tente perdue. Entre le bois et le camp sont plus tard retrouvés trois autres corps, figés dans des poses suggérant qu'ils cherchaient à regagner leur abri. Les trois cadavres restants sont découverts dans un ravin au mois de mai, couverts de plusieurs mètres de [neige](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/8165/neige). Sur les dépouilles, de [violentes](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/529/violence) blessures sont constatées: «Des crânes fêlés, des côtes cassées, liste Donnie Eichar. Deux d'entre eux avaient les jambes brûlées. Il manquait un morceau de langue à l'un d'eux.» Et deux des victimes n'avaient plus d'yeux. La vraie question Dans la Russie soviétique d'alors, la conclusion de l'enquête sur la disparition des randonneurs ressemble au synopsis d'une saison de True Detective. Leur [mort](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/397/mort) aurait été causée «par une irrésistible force naturelle». Pour Donnie Eichar, qui a travaillé cinq ans sur cette affaire, se demander ce qui a tué ces huit personnes n'est pas se poser la bonne question: «Ils sont morts d'hypothermie.» Selon lui, chaque [blessure](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/10057/blessure), aussi terrifiante soit-elle pour un secouriste retrouvant des corps glacés à 50 bornes de toute forme de civilisation, peut également être expliquée. «Les os cassés étaient dus à la chute dans le ravin. Une des victimes est tombée en arrière. Quand la neige a commencé à fondre au printemps, l'eau et les microbes ont mangé sa chair. Et donc sa langue. Ensuite, si tu restes si longtemps dans la neige, des animaux viendront te picorer. Et possiblement manger tes yeux. Enfin, quand la température de ton corps est si basse et que tu te réchauffes avec un feu, tu peux perdre conscience. Cela explique les membres brûlés. Deux d'entre eux ont dû s'évanouir dans les flammes.» La véritable question est donc celle-ci: «Pourquoi ont-ils quitté leur tente, peu vêtus et dans le noir, pour marcher directement vers leur mort?» Blocs de glace ou infrasons Cette interrogation a donné naissance à de nombreuses théories. Les [enquêteurs](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/1113/enquete) sont d'abord allés embêter les membres de la tribu des Mansis, peuple d'éleveurs de rennes de la région, suspectés d'avoir attaqué et tué des étudiants coupables d'avoir osé fouler leurs terres. Or, les locaux n'ont jamais été connus pour leur animosité et les blessures des randonneurs sont trop violentes pour avoir été causées par des humains. «Certains ont dit que des aliens ou un yéti étaient responsables, intervient Donnie Eichar. Beaucoup de gens ont du mal à accepter les tragédies qui ne sont pas causées par un méchant bien identifiable.» À la même période que l'événement, dans le même périmètre, d'autres randonneurs ont rapporté avoir observé d'étranges sphères oranges dans le ciel, phénomène également signalé depuis la petite ville d'Ivdel. Certains ont suggéré que ces lumières étaient causées par des mines parachutées. Elles auraient pu réveiller les randonneurs qui, paniqués par le vacarme, auraient fui leur tente sans prendre le temps de se vêtir. Mais Donnie Eichar assure qu'il n'existe aucune [preuve](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/21229/preuves) de cela: «Des météorologistes ont en effet attesté de la présence de ces sphères oranges dans la nuit du 3 février. Elles étaient dues à des exercices militaires, des lancements de roquettes. C'est documenté. J'ai interviewé le membre du groupe qui est rentré le 28 janvier parce qu'il était malade. Il pense que ses amis sont tombés sur un site militaire. Mais j'ai consulté les registres militaires sur place et il n'y avait aucun site. C'est trop isolé pour ça.» Six ans après la sortie du livre de Donnie Eichar en 2013, les autorités russes ont rouvert l'enquête. En juin 2020, elles ont conclu qu'une [avalanche](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/28097/avalanche) avait été responsable de l'événement. Professeur à l'École polytechnique fédérale de Zurich, le natif de Moscou Alexander Puzrin a quant à lui publié en janvier 2021 un article universitaire intitulé [«Mechanisms of slab avalanche release and impact in the Dyatlov Pass incident in 1959»](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-00081-8) («Mécanismes de déclenchement de l'avalanche de plaque et impact lors de l'événement du col Dyatlov en 1959»). Pour lui, une avalanche de plaque a pu causer la fuite des randonneurs. Et donc leur mort. «Quand les gens pensent à une avalanche, ils pensent à un tsunami de neige qui emporte tout sur son passage, dit-il. Une avalanche de plaque, elle, arrive lorsque la neige s'est changée en un bloc de glace sur une couche plus fragile et tombe le long de la pente. Cela peut être large de trente mètres. C'est une neige très lourde qui peut avoir des effets dévastateurs.» Le vent qui soufflait dans la nuit aurait fait s'accumuler de la [neige](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/8165/neige) au-dessus de la tente des campeurs jusqu'à ce que le bloc de glace devienne trop lourd pour la couche inférieure. Et que tout leur dévale dessus. Alexander Puzrin enchaîne: «Là, on rentre dans la spéculation, mais on peut se dire que le bloc n'était pas assez gros pour les tuer mais suffisamment pour provoquer le genre de blessures qu'ils ont reçues, détruire leur tente et causer leur fuite. On sait qu'il faisait très sombre, qu'il y avait beaucoup de vent. Récupérer leurs habits ne devait pas être chose aisée. Certains étant peut-être blessés, ils avaient d'abord besoin d'un nouvel abri avant de pouvoir réfléchir à quoi faire par la suite. Et le seul abri possible, c'était la forêt.» Le scientifique tient néanmoins à préciser que son rôle n'est pas d'affirmer qu'une avalanche a causé la perte des randonneurs, mais seulement d'établir, «en utilisant les lois de la physiques», qu'il s'agit là d'une possibilité. Il n'a aucune certitude et le [mystère](https://www.slate.fr/dossier/6467/mystere) demeure. Donnie Eichar, lui, a une autre théorie. «Ça s'appelle une “allée de tourbillons de Von Karman”, expose-t-il. Quand un vent horizontal frappe une structure en forme de dôme, il peut se transformer en tourbillons. Cela peut générer des infrasons que l'oreille humaine ne peut pas entendre mais qui déstabilisent l'équilibre. Tu n'arrives plus à réfléchir. Tout ce qu'ils auraient pu entendre en dehors de la tente, c'est un bruit semblable à des hurlements de trains de marchandises. Dans ces circonstances, ce n'est pas étonnant de réagir en prenant un couteau pour déchirer sa tente et s'enfuir. Parce que tu as peur de mourir.»",

    "title": "United Airlines Technicians Reject Proposal To Outsource Work To China",
    "text": "United Airlines technicians have rejected a proposal to outsource work to China, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The news comes shortly after United Airlines' technicians once again rallied nationwide, demanding improved wages and more comprehensive health care coverage.\n\"Disgraceful economic proposal\"\nThe labor union, representing United's Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs), has voted down the proposal to what they called \"the carrier's latest disgraceful economic proposal.\" Notably, 99.5% of United Airlines' mechanics represented by the Teamsters Union rejected the deal, which would have outsourced the workforce to \"communist China.\"\nIn a statement released on March 25, 2025, Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien and Teamsters Airline Division Director Chris Griswold, said:\n\"United Airlines' executives think they can strong-arm 10,000 Teamsters technicians into accepting a terrible deal. Instead, our members just sent a clear message that this company can't ignore. United's radical, un-American contract proposal is dead on arrival.\n\"United's short-sighted cash grab reflects everything that's wrong with Big Business at a time when we should be bringing back jobs to America.\"\nThe Teamsters Union represents more than 10,000 United Airlines maintenance technicians across the country. Simple Flying has asked United Airlines for comment.\nTechnicians battle for fair pay\nIn 2024, United reported pre-tax earnings of $4.2 billion and an adjusted net income of $3.5 billion. While United Airlines has cashed in during the year, its technicians have been fighting for stronger employment contracts, demanding increased pay, higher safety standards, and better health care coverage.\n\"United raked in $4 billion in profits last year off the backs of highly skilled, hardworking Teamsters who keep planes flying safely. Rather than reward them, United wants to gut good American jobs and gamble with safety.\"\nThe technicians have also been unhappy about United Airlines sending its aircraft offshore for heavy maintenance, something the union highlighted in its statement earlier in March 2025. O'Brien described the situation as a reckless race to the bottom and something the Teamsters Union would not stand for.\nOn March 13, 2025, United Airlines' maintenance workers once again rallied at the carrier's San Francisco Maintenance Base (SFO). This was not the first time the airline's technicians had rallied for more substantial contracts. The workers picketed outside airports in August and September 2024, and again in March 2025.\nIt is worth noting that United Airlines has one of the largest fleets in the world. It operates a total of 1,015 aircraft, with an average age of 17.2 years, according to ch-aviation fleets data. Notably, the Chicago-based carrier's fleet comprises 141 Boeing 737-800s, 136 Boeing 737-900ERs, 114 Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 92 Boeing 737 MAX 9s, 96 Boeing 777s, 81 Airbus A319-100s, 76 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, 78 Airbus A320-200s, 61 Boeing 757s, 53 Boeing 767s, 40 Boeing 737-700s, 33 Airbus A321neo aircraft, and 12 Boeing 737-900s.\nIt is not uncommon for airlines across the world to send widebody aircraft offshore for maintenance, particularly when heavy checks are needed. Airlines in the US, Europe, and Asia often outsource those involved checks to specialists to reduce cost or to find shop capacity they may not have available in-house at that time.\nRelated\n\"We Won't Rest\": United Airlines Maintenance Technicians Rally For New Contract\nUnited Airlines and its maintenance technicians are in dispute over an employment contract deal",

    "title": "\"Un système de prédateurs\": ce que l'on sait de Notre-Dame-de-Bétharram, cette institution catholique prisée où régnaient \"violences\", \"prédation\" et \"silence\" - Var-Matin",
    "text": "\"Dénoncer les méthode barbares\"\n\"Vous savez chez les familles nombreuses aisées, c'est comme sur les chemises, il y a toujours un bouton pas comme les autres... alors on l'envoyait à Bétharram\" , résume ce \"petit artisan\" aujourd'hui retraité, à l'origine de la première plainte au printemps 1996 pour \"dénoncer les méthode barbares\" de l'établissement.\nL'institution catholique, avec son pensionnat à la réputation \"stricte\", a attiré pendant des décennies de bonnes familles du grand Sud-Ouest AFP/Archives / Philippe LOPEZ. Son fils, camarade de classe d'un des fils de François Bayrou, a perdu une partie de son audition après avoir été giflé par le surveillant général.\nParmi les punitions infligées, des témoins évoquent à l'AFP le \"supplice du perron\", obligeant les adolescents jugés agités à rester en sous-vêtement une à deux heures dehors en plein hiver sur le perron bordant le gave de Pau.\nPour Jean-François Blanco, l'avocat de l'adolescent giflé, \" la violence était une méthode éducative et les parents acceptaient qu'on mette leur enfant au pas. En réalité, beaucoup de personnes trouvaient ça acceptable\".\nL'ancien avocat, devenu élu municipal d'opposition à Pau, se rappelle avoir fait face en 1996 à \"l'hostilité\" d'un comité de soutien de Bétharram, constitué d'avocats anciens élèves de l'institution.\n\"Tout ce qu'on révèle aujourd'hui sur des châtiments corporels, c'était connu, c'était même, j'allais dire, la charte éducative de l'établissement. Tout le monde savait que les élèves incorrigibles allaient finir là-bas ,\" abonde Me Thierry Sagardoytho, qui avait défendu une victime dans un premier dossier de viol en 1998, abandonné deux ans plus tard après le suicide du prêtre mis en cause.\n\" Même les chuchotements, c'étaient des avalanches de coups\" A ce climat de \"violence gratuite\", s'est greffé au sein du pensionnat \" un système de prédateurs\" longtemps tu, raconte Alain Esquerre, le porte-parole des victimes de l'établissement.\nParmi les récits des victimes âgées d'entre 8 et 13 ans à l'époque des faits: des masturbations et fellations imposées ou subies plusieurs fois par semaine , des châtiments corporels, menaces et humiliations.\nAu total, 112 plaintes ont été déposées auprès du parquet de Pau, qui a ouvert une enquête l'année dernière pour des violences, agressions sexuelles et viols commis essentiellement entre les années 1970 et 1990.\n\"Bétharram, c'était le règne du silence. On ne pouvait que chuchoter et même les chuchotements, c'étaient des avalanches de coups\" , ajoute M. Esquerre.\n\"Dans cet établissement, c'est comme s'il y avait deux univers, l'univers des externes et l'univers des internes (...), un univers dont on ne peut pas supporter l'idée\", a expliqué samedi François Bayrou, aux côtés de M. Esquerre.\nEn tant qu'ancien \"parent d'élèves\" externes, le Premier ministre a maintenu n'avoir \"jamais entendu parlé, quand j'étais ministre de l'Éducation nationale (1993-1997, ndlr), de sévices sexuels\".\nAlain Esquerre, le porte-parole de l'association des victimes de l'école secondaire catholique notre-Dame-de-Bétharram, s'adresse à la presse à l'hôtel de ville de Pau, le 15 février 2025 AFP / PHILIPPE LOPEZ. Un premier rapport, diligenté par l'inspection académique en 1996, à sa demande, a-t-il précisé, avait conclu que Notre-Dame-de-Bétharram n'était \"pas un établissement où les élèves sont brutalisés\".\nToujours sous contrat avec l'Éducation nationale, l'établissement n'est plus dirigé depuis 2009 par la congrégation du Sacré-Coeur de Jésus de Bétharram et a été renommé Le Beau Rameau.\nL'ensemble scolaire, qui a supprimé son pensionnat, accueille désormais 520 élèves de la maternelle au lycée.\n\"Pour nous, les coupables ne sont plus dans cet établissement, ce sont des faits d'une époque plus ancienne. Mais c'est forcément inquiétant et perturbant pour nos enfants d'entendre tout ça\", expliquait à l'AFP un parent d'élève, sous couvert d'anonymat, devant les grilles de l'établissement mercredi.\nà lire aussi Affaire Bétharram: acculé, François Bayrou nie avoir \"été au courant\" et assure \"avoir fait\" ce qu'il \"devait faire\" quand il était ministre de l'Education\nLIRE LES COMMENTAIRES",
