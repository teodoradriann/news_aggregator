    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "Before Becoming Hollywood's Tough Guy, George Kennedy Served 16 Years in the US Army",
    "text": "By Samantha Franco ,\n7 hours ago\nGeorge Kennedy, known for his Academy Award-winning performances, is associated with portraying tough, strong characters in film and television. His distinctive acting style was shaped by his personal experiences, including 16 years of service in the US Army. His military career was unexpectedly cut short by an injury, leaving room to wonder if different circumstances might have extended his service or if his path was always meant to lead him to Hollywood fame.\nGeorge Kennedy's early beginnings in show business Guns of the Magnificent Seven , 1969. (Photo Credit: United Artists / Getty Images) George Kennedy was born on February 18, 1925, in New York City, to a family deeply rooted in the entertainment world. His father, an orchestra leader and musician, and his mother, a former ballet dancer, ensured he was involved in show business from a young age.\nAt just two years old, Kennedy made his on-stage debut in a touring production of Bringing Up Father . Tragedy struck when his father died two years later, leaving his mother to raise him alone. Despite this hardship, Kennedy continued to advance his early career, performing as a radio act from the age of seven until the beginning of World War II .\nAfter graduating from Chaminade High School in Long Island, Kennedy chose to enlist in the US Army.\nServing under Gen. George Patton Zig Zag , 1970. (Photo Credit: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer / Getty Images) George Kennedy initially tried to enlist in the US Army Air Forces, but his physical stature posed problems.\n\"I'm six-foot-four, and even in those days I weighed 210 pound,\" Kennedy once reminisced . \"I was interested in airplanes then, and I'm interested in airplanes now. The best explanation came from a master sergeant in the Air Force. He said, 'George, there's nothing wrong with you. But we can either put you in an airplane or we can put a 200-pound bomb in an airplane. We'd rather put the bomb in the airplane.'\"\nInstead, Kennedy enlisted as an infantryman in the US Army, serving under Gen. George Patton , whom he'd later portray in 1978's Brass Target . One of the most notable engagements he participated in was the Battle of the Bulge . Reflecting on the war later in life, he commented on the danger he and his fellow servicemen faced.\n\"Kids who had never done anything more dangerous than play kickball in the street were shooting BAR's and mortars and killing each other... The war was one horrendous surprise after another. I can't think of anything I did during the war that did not involve death,\" he said.\nKennedy's time with the military came to an end after 16 years due a back injury he suffered in the late 1950s. At the time of his retirement, he'd achieved the rank of captain and earned a number of recognitions, including two Bronze Stars.\nDeveloping the US Army Information Office Sarge , 1971-72. (Photo Credit: Silver Screen Collection / Getty Images) During his time in the Army, George Kennedy drew on his experience as a radio actor to take on a new role as a disc jockey for the Armed Forces Network (AFN), in a situation reminiscent of the 1987 film, Good Morning, Vietnam .\nThis role had a dual impact: it influenced both the future of the Army and Kennedy's own career. For the military, it helped pave the way for the creation of the US Army Information Office, which provided technical support to the entertainment industry. For Kennedy, it offered valuable professional experience that would later shape his acting career after his military service.\nGeorge Kennedy always played the tough guy George Kennedy, 1980. (Photo Credit: Silver Screen Collection / Getty Images) When George Kennedy left the Army, he worked as a technical advisor on the Phil Silvers Show (1955-59). While in this role, he sometimes played small, uncredited characters that influenced his desire to pursue professional acting. He subsequently gained supporting roles on various television series, typically playing a cowboy, outlaw or lawman.\nAlthough he'd made several television appearances, Kennedy's film debut came in the early 1960s. Some of the notable credits of his early movie career include Charade (1963), Flight of the Phoenix (1966) and The Dirty Dozen (1967). The one that shot him to new heights was Cool Hand Luke (1967), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. During this time, he shared the screen with other high-profile stars, including Paul Newman , Cary Grant , Kirk Douglas and Joan Crawford .\nKennedy appeared in over 200 movies and TV shows The Naked Gun , 1988. (Photo Credit: yodasimpson / Paramount Pictures / MovieStillsDB) During the 1970s and '80s, Kennedy's career took a bit of a dive, with him largely landing B-rated and low-budget films. As a result, he shifted gears to television. The late 1980s and '90s changed this trajectory again, as the actor found new popularity, starring in the parody Naked Gun films.\nNew!

He retired from show business following his appearance in 2014's The Gambler , and died two years later in Middleton, Idaho, at the age of 91.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
