    "title": "Part of Pennsylvania under a fire warning until Friday evening - pennlive.com",
    "text": "On Friday at 9:53 a.m. a red flag warning was issued by the National Weather Service valid for Friday between noon and 7 p.m. for Blair, Huntingdon, Bedford, Fulton, Franklin, Union, Snyder, Montour, Northumberland, Columbia, Perry, Dauphin, Lebanon, Cumberland, Adams, York and Lancaster counties.\nResidents can expect winds to be west 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph and relative humidity as low as 25 to 30 percent.\n\"Rapid wildfire growth and spread expected. Outdoor burning is not recommended,\" adds the weather service.\nWhat is the significance of a red flag warning? A red flag warning signifies that either extreme fire weather conditions are currently in effect or will be shortly, as stated by the weather service. Warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire to spread rapidly.\nSo, what steps should you follow during a red flag warning? During a red flag warning, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and be prepared to take immediate action in case a fire starts. The weather service offers these steps you can take to lower the risk of fires igniting and ensure your safety:\n1. Bolster burn barrel safety:\nIn areas where controlled burning is sanctioned, make certain that burn barrels sport a weighty metal cover, equipped with holes no larger than 3/4 of an inch. 2. Mindful handling of smoking materials:\nNever discard lit cigarette butts outside, and avoid tossing cigarettes or matches from a moving vehicle. These seemingly small actions can lead to dry grass ignition, potentially sparking a wildfire. 3. Prudent fire extinguishing practices:\nTo safeguard against accidental fires, diligently extinguish all outdoor fires. Drown them with an ample amount of water and stir to confirm that everything is cold to the touch. Submerge charcoal in water until it's thoroughly cooled. Never dispose of live charcoal on the ground. 4. Never leave fires unattended:\nRECOMMENDED • pennlive.com\nFire warning for Southeast Pa. until Friday evening Nov. 1, 2024, 8:23 a.m.\nFire weather watch for part of Pennsylvania until Friday evening Nov. 1, 2024, 3:11 a.m.\nAvoid leaving any fire unattended. Even sparks or embers carried by the wind can ignite nearby leaves or grass, triggering a fire that spreads rapidly. Understanding the gravity of a red flag warning and adhering to these precautions is pivotal in mitigating the risk of wildfires during these perilous conditions. Prioritize safety, stay well-informed, and act responsibly to safeguard lives and property.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "text": "Wednesday, April 2nd 2025, 5:49 pm\nOn cell phones and tablets, there is literally an app for everything. A group of students at Francis Tuttle Vo-tech have come up with an idea for a new app, and there is already excitement about this one, nationally.\n“This wasn’t a class project. This was completely of their own initiative,” said Andy Harbert, teacher at Francis Tuttle Vo-tech.\nThe national contest put on by Congress is called the House of Code. The students at Francis Tuttle had never heard of the competition, so it took a little time for the creative juices to start flowing.\n“We were considering it for a couple of months, but it wasn’t until like, three months before the competition deadline was coming up,” said Francis Tuttle student Efren Llanes.\nWith the deadline coming, that’s when students, Nathan Lam, Aurial Teemoi, Jason Hull, and Efren Llanes, went to work creating an app that they call VoiceIt.\nThe concept for the VoiceIt app came pretty naturally.\n“Walking outside of a supermarket and we saw a lady with a petition clipboard and we were like we may be able to make that a little better,” said Llanes.\n“They built the app, they created a video, which was part of the contest, and went to downtown Oklahoma City and won first place,” said Harbert.\nThe app allows users to create, sign, and share petitions with thousands of subscribers even reaching their congressperson.\n“So, we have the title, a little short description, the amount of people that signed it, how many days the petition will be open,” said Llanes.\nUsers of the app must be registered voters.\n“It was actually kind of ironic that we created this whole petition but at the time none of us were even old enough to vote,” said Llanes.\nThe next step is a trip to Washington DC to present the app to Congress.\n“When we also get a tour of the white house and like he said get a meeting with Stephanie Bice our district five representative,” said Jason Hull, Francis Tuttle student.\nThe students leave next week to present their app in DC along with the other winners from all over the country.",

By Justin Craft Published: Dec. 12, 2024 at 8:57 AM CST Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nNORTH PLATTE, Neb. (KNOP) - The National Weather Service has released its preliminary winter weather outlook, warning residents of potential hazards as the colder months approach.\nMeteorologists are closely monitoring conditions that could lead to hazardous winter storms, along with an elevated risk for ice jams along rivers and streams.\n“Ice jamming occurs quite frequently but thankfully the jams are usually not significant, said NWS Meteorologist Shawn Jacobs. “We don’t suggest people go anywhere near the river when there is ice forming or jamming up but they tend to be more of a nuisance for people with property along the river.”\nThe NWS urges people to remember safety first.\n“It’s a great reminder to stay off the ice on the rivers and it’s been warmer than normal and that ice and water underneath causes dangerous conditions,” said Jacobs. “So if the river is jamming up just use caution and stay away.”\nLastly, people should stay vigilant and ready for potential emergencies.\n“We want everybody to be prepared and have a plan because it’s a question of when winter storms will come here in Nebraska and people living in town and the farmers and ranchers who live in rural areas make sure to have a plan and be prepared,” said Jacobs.\nClick here to subscribe to our KNOP News 2 daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2024 KNOP.

    "text": "The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of Western New York and program director Sherry Byrnes have been at it for decades.\n\"Born out of a group of mothers who had spent the previous four or five years looking at each other across emergency rooms, waiting rooms, day rooms and sometimes at funerals to say it got to be able to be better than this,\" she said.\nThey are continuing to build out a network of advocacy and aid.\n\"In some ways, it's a little bit easier now because people don't go, mental illness, we can't talk about that,\" she said. \"We are going to talk about that. We do talk about that.\"\nFrom Byrnes, who runs programming for the Western New York branch, to Jeff Pirrone, who keeps the lights on and paperwork in order, they couldn't do it if they didn't have staff and volunteers like themselves touched in some way by mental illness.\n\"Passing along their experiences and their what they've learned through support groups and through their experience with their loved ones,\" Pirrone said. \"Passing that along to other people so that they can learn and grow and become better caregivers themselves.\"\nThrough a help line, family groups and classes, their lived experience brings more help to the table.\n\"It would have made the challenges that we faced and are still facing more navigable,\" he added. \"Because of that, I committed myself and our team has always been committed to making sure that no family has to go through that as well.\"\nGetting the word out is half the battle because NAMI touches more lives every day.\n\"People that had never had inklings about anxiety all of a sudden had anxiety, but they didn't realize maybe they started to realize more people live with this every day,\" said board member and longtime volunteer Patricia Foster.\nExploding over the pandemic with people taking long looks at their situations and realizing more about mental health than ever before.\n\"It affects the whole family. So a person that is dealing with that every day with a parent or a sibling or whatever it may be, is struggling with their own mental health to try to get through it, too,\" Foster said.\nShe's been on the board for 10 years, and has been through the ringer with unseen scars and volunteers knowing tomorrow is another step in the right direction.\n\"NAMI is a family and it truly is. I have been very lucky to be a part of it and will continue being a part of it,\" Foster said.\n\"There is not a day that I walk out of here, no matter how tired I am. No matter how much bureaucracy there's been, no matter how busy it is that I don't know, 100% that what I did today made a difference,\" added Byrnes.",

    "text": "El 24 de julio de 2025 , Madrid disfrutará de un día completamente despejado, con cielos limpios que permitirán que el sol brille intensamente a lo largo de la jornada. Desde las primeras horas de la mañana, la visibilidad será excelente, lo que invitará a los madrileños a salir y aprovechar el buen tiempo. Las temperaturas comenzarán en torno a los 24 grados a las 00:00 horas, descendiendo ligeramente a 22 grados a la 01:00 y alcanzando un mínimo de 17 grados hacia las 07:00. A medida que avance el día, se espera un aumento gradual de la temperatura, alcanzando un máximo de 29 grados a las 17:00 horas. La humedad relativa se mantendrá en niveles moderados, comenzando en un 48% y descendiendo a un 30% hacia el final de la jornada. Esto contribuirá a que la sensación térmica sea agradable, a pesar del calor que se experimentará durante las horas pico. La combinación de temperaturas cálidas y una humedad relativamente baja hará que el tiempo sea ideal para actividades al aire libre, como paseos por el parque o visitas a las terrazas de la ciudad.\nEn cuanto al viento, se prevé que sople del noreste con velocidades que oscilarán entre 16 y 34 km/h a lo largo del día. Las ráfagas más intensas se registrarán en las primeras horas de la mañana y durante la tarde, alcanzando hasta 50 km/h. Este viento fresco será un alivio ante las altas temperaturas, proporcionando un ambiente más confortable para disfrutar del día.\nNo se esperan precipitaciones en ninguna parte del día, lo que significa que los planes al aire libre no se verán interrumpidos por la lluvia. La probabilidad de precipitación es nula, lo que refuerza la idea de que será un día perfecto para disfrutar de actividades al aire libre, como picnics, deportes o simplemente pasear por las calles de Madrid .\nCon el orto a las 07:04 y el ocaso a las 21:37, los madrileños podrán disfrutar de largas horas de luz solar. Este día soleado y cálido será una excelente oportunidad para disfrutar de la vibrante vida de la ciudad, así como de sus espacios verdes y culturales. En resumen, el 24 de julio se presenta como un día ideal para disfrutar de Madrid en todo su esplendor, con un tiempo que invita a salir y disfrutar de la vida al aire libre.\nInformación elaborada utilizando, entre otras, la obtenida de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología. © AEMET.
