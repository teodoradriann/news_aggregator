    "title": "Two weekend weather problems for NJ: Humidity and storms",
    "text": "The Bottom Line Oh, the humidity! It has been a steamy summer so far. So much so that your electric bill may be off the charts. But we have largely lucked out on weekends, with very little rain and/or other hazardous weather situations. That trend is about to change, as the forecast for this first weekend of August is less than perfect. It will be steamy, as disgustingly high humidity combines with unseasonably hot temperatures. And it will be stormy, as several impulses ride through New Jersey's atmosphere. Given how \"juicy\" the atmosphere is, any thunderstorm that forms could dump a quick 1 to 2+ inches of rain. That is plenty to raise flooding concerns. Gusty winds are possible from strong storm cells too. Looking long-range, temperatures will cool down next week. But we will have to watch the cluster of rain that will likely become a tropical storm (Debby) in the next day or two. As that storm system rides up the U.S. East Coast, we could see some rain and surf impacts in the mid to late part of next week. Friday Partly cloudy and 80 degrees. That would make for a delightful mid-June afternoon. But first thing in the morning? Not a happy start. You know it's going to be another very warm day. High temperatures on Friday will reach about 90 to 95 degrees. As usual, it will be a few degrees cooler in far northern New Jersey and along the Jersey Shore, in the 80s. Technically that is a few degrees cooler than Thursday, when we hit 100 degrees in a couple spots (Hamilton and Newark). But humidity will be higher. So the heat index calculation works out the same, feeling like over 100 degrees in many spots Friday afternoon. An Excessive Heat Warning and Heat Advisory cover all but the immediate coast through Friday evening. Please take care of yourself in this unseasonable, uncomfortable weather. Weatherwise, we will see times of clouds and sun for the first half of Friday. Now let's talk about thunderstorms. A hot and humid atmosphere is conducive to explosive storm development. So any storm that comes through New Jersey Friday and this weekend will be capable of producing very heavy rain, in addition to gusty winds. Initial thunderstorms on Friday could enter the Garden State as early as mid-afternoon, let's say 3 p.m. They will begin to the northwest, spreading south and east through Friday evening. (I would wager on most of NJ seeing storms in the evening hours.). We should see a gradual reduction in storm intensity after sunset. Final thunderstorms probably will not exit the state until after Midnight, early Saturday morning. Some forecast models are pumping out an inch or two of rain in a brief period of time, which raises serious flooding alarm bells. Beyond the thunderstorm potential, lingering clouds and some fog will carry through the overnight hours. Low temperatures will only drop into the mid 70s. Saturday High humidity takes center stage on Saturday, as dew points surge into the mid 70s. Downright tropical air, making things very uncomfortable statewide. And potentially fueling more thunderstorms. The first half of Saturdayday will be OK, just sweaty. Expect partly sunny skies and high temperatures around 90 degrees. Then, again, scattered thunderstorms become likely through the afternoon and evening hours. And again, they will likely be on the strong side, with pockets of heavy stuff around the state. I would pinpoint 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. as the best chance for storms. Sunday I am more pessimistic about Sunday's forecast than Saturday's, as the day will be cloudier and rainier overall. You will still catch some breaks, depending where you are and how luck you get. A few waves of spotty showers and thunderstorms will sweep through New Jersey throughout the day on Sunday. One piece of good news: They are less likely to be severe (i.e. gusty). But storms still could produce localized downpours. Another highlight of Sunday: It will not be as hot, thanks to the clouds and raindrops. High temperatures will reach about 85 to 90 degrees. Our Jersey heat wave may break. But do not be fooled — it will still be very warm and humid Sunday. Monday We look to get a break from the unsettled weather on Monday, although little relief from the summertime heat. Under mostly sunny skies, high temperatures will again rise into the lower 90s Monday afternoon. Best case scenario, dew points and humidity levels slide backward a little bit. All forecast models keep Monday dry and storm-free. Tuesday & Beyond Our weather forecast gets exponentially trickier by the middle of the week, as a slow-moving front approaches. There could also be a tropical storm in the neighborhood. A cluster of rain centered over Haiti as of Friday morning will likely develop into a tropical storm as it enters the Gulf of Mexico this weekend. The next name on the list for the Atlantic this year is Debby. After sliding across Florida, future-Debby will likely parallel the U.S. East Coast for a bit. What it does as it passes North Carolina will have a huge impact on our weather for the middle to late part of next week. I see three basic scenarios playing out in the Wednesday to Saturday time frame: 1.) Debby flies out to sea. We would see some trough-driven rain, possibly enhanced by some tropical moisture. And surf will be rough for a couple days. But overall impacts would be minor. 2.) Debby stalls off the Carolinas. This could consistently feed tropical moisture our way, leading to persistently rain. Not necessarily heavy stuff, but overall a dreary and drizzly weather pattern. Surf would still be rough in this scenario, likely through next weekend. 3.) Debby beelines for New Jersey-Pennsylvania. Worst-case scenario dumps multiple inches of rain over New Jersey late next week. (Maybe on the order of 4 to 8 inches in spots?) I would not be worried about wind. Storm surge and very rough surf could be significant too. 11 reasons why storm chasing in NJ is a very, very bad idea Gallery Credit: Dan Zarrow Dan Zarrow is Chief Meteorologist for Townsquare Media New Jersey.

    "text": "Office of Administration to debut state workforce employee referral program JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (KAIT) - The Office of Administration is set to debut a new state employee referral program. The program, Show Me’s Got Talent, was created to incentivize current state team members from eligible executive departments to advocate for and endorse jobs to quality candidates, positively impacting the hiring and retention of our state workforce. “Implementing a state employee referral program is not just about finding new talent; it’s about fostering a culture of collaboration and shared success,” said Commissioner Ken Zellers, Office of Administration. “When our own team members become ambassadors for the State of Missouri, we not only tap into a rich pool of potential candidates but also strengthen the bonds that make our state workforce a community dedicated to excellence.” The program was proposed by the winners of the 2022 Show Me Challenge, which is a program that allows state team members across Missouri’s 17 executive departments to identify solutions that improve how we serve our citizens. In preparation for the competition, the team researched best practices in both private and public sectors including collaborating with state departments on any existing programs. OA’s Division of Personnel crafted a project plan that enhanced our technology to support the new program, automating payment processes, and implementing an overarching communication strategy. OA was then able to secure funding in the FY 24 budget to launch the program. “Through the launch of this new state employee referral program, this recruitment strategy helps us commit to building a unified, empowered workforce,” said Jessie Pace, Manager, Talent Acquisition, Office of Administration. “By encouraging our team members to be architects of our state’s future, we will be able to source top talent and forge a collaborative spirit that propels us to better helping our customers.” Executive branch departments that recruit using the MO Careers job application platform are eligible to participate in the statewide program. Eligible employees who successfully refer a candidate will be eligible for $250 or $500 at the new team member’s 90-day tenure. The $500 will be awarded to employees who refer candidates to hard-to-fill positions. Candidates must also be hired into a full-time, benefit-eligible position as advertised on MO Careers. Automation for payment will be processed through MO Careers. When the program launches, state employees will be able to create an account to join the Employee Referral Program. Team members involved in the hiring/recruiting process will not be eligible to participate in this program. Candidates must be first-time hires or candidates who have not been employed by the State of Missouri within the last six months before application submission. The new Employee Referral Program officially launches on January 1, 2024. For more information on the program, please visit [hireMOtalent.mo.gov](http://hireMOtalent.mo.gov). Copyright 2023 KAIT.

I think that there is a foreign hand which never rests and keeps attacking our forces and people. Bravo to our military, police and other law-enforcement organizations which are fighting and trying their best to root out the menace of terrorism. In order to supplement these efforts, we should start a programme similar to the ‘neighbourhood watches’ present in many Western countries including the UK. These programmes give people the responsibility to monitor any suspicious activities in their neighbourhoods and play a role in safeguarding towns and cities.

Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#5](c5#c-5) En realidad este discurso en concreto se parece más al del ISIS que al de Hitler.\nAunque el resultado de ambos sea el mismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia.

    "text": "El agujero de la Junta\nAlto y claro\nJuanma Moreno ha dicho en unas declaraciones recientes que no está satisfecho de cómo marchan las cosas en la sanidad pública andaluza. Lo ha dicho como dicen estas cosas los políticos, recalcando lo mucho que, según él, se ha mejorado en los últimos años y la enormidad que han invertido sus gobiernos en relación con lo poco que lo hicieron los socialistas, pero admitiendo que queda mucho por hacer y que entiende que los ciudadanos no estén satisfechos y le pidan cuenta por ello.\nHay que reconocer que no todos los días se escucha decir a un gobernante, aunque sea en pasiva, que hay un agujero en la principal política a la que tiene que dedicar sus esfuerzos. La sanidad es, con diferencia, el más cuantioso capítulo de sus presupuestos y el área de gestión que más incidencia tiene en la vida diaria de los andaluces. El hecho de que se admita que siguen existiendo, siete años después del cambio de gobierno, enormes agujeros es una muestra de realismo político.\nPero, sobre todo, es el reconocimiento de que en política sanitaria no se están haciendo cosas muy diferentes de las que hicieron los socialistas durante las décadas que gobernaron. Las acusaciones de que el sistema se está dejando en manos de operadores privados es más un eslogan de lucha política que una realidad que vivan los usuarios. Y es también la constatación de que estamos ante un problema sin solución porque es imposible acomodar la oferta a la demanda, ni tan siquiera aproximarlas. Los recursos con los que va a contar Andalucía para gestionar su sanidad van a ser siempre limitados y la demanda no dejará nunca de crecer.\nNo quiere decir ello que las cosas no se puedan hacer mejor, siempre que las disponibilidades financieras existan y que se extreme la calidad en la dirección política y profesional. No parece que ni lo uno ni lo otro esté ocurriendo en Andalucía. El baile de equipos al frente de la Consejería de Salud y del Servicio Andaluz de Salud y las tensiones con las que los cambios se han producido revelan que los responsables han estado lejos de los niveles de eficacia que cabría exigirles. La sanidad pública no será nunca perfecta, pero los andaluces tienen derecho a exigir mejoras que por lo menos la acerquen a lo que debería ser.\nTambién te puede interesar",

    "title": "Best Toners to Use for Mature Skin, According to Skin Pros | Woman's World",
    "text": "Beauty Best Toners for Mature Skin That Make Your Complexion Look Younger + Smoother Plus, the how-to video that shows you when to use this product in your skin care routine If the word “toner” conjures images of oily-skinned teens and a drying liquid that leaves your skin stinging, we don’t blame you. After all, that’s precisely what they were in the past — and who they were intended for — that is, until fairly recently. But today’s toners are nothing like their predecessors. Rather, they’re a more expansive and versatile skincare category than ever before, with options for a host of different skin types and complexion concerns. And while, yes, they’re an added step in your routine, but according to skincare pros, it’s one that’s well-worth the effort. Here, a primer on toners (what they do, how to pick one, etc.) and the best toners that will work for you. What is a toner? “A toner is typically a water-based liquid solution that’s used in between the cleansing step and the rest of your skin care routine ,” explains Ivey Rogers , aesthetician educator and community engagement manager at USRx . “Years ago, toners were mostly intended for those with oily and/or acneic skin to help dry it out. Today, most toners are formulated to replenish and hydrate while also brightening and protecting the skin from free radical damage.” But keep in mind that not all toners are created equal. That’s why experts like Rogers advise choosing the right one for your skin in order to see the best results (more on this below). Check out the video below from the Fleur & Bee YouTube channel to learn more about toners. Why mature skin benefits from using a toner Toners are a great way to amp up your existing routine and achieve your skincare goals. First and foremost, they’re ideal for ensuring that your complexion is as clean as possible. They help remove excess residue, oil or lingering dirt or debris that didn’t come off during cleansing, says Brendan Camp, MD , a board-certified dermatologist in New York. And per Rogers’ previous point, while they used to be more astringent, the majority of toners are now moisturizing, making them a great choice for those with mature skin or aging concerns. “Our oil glands start to shrink and our skin gets drier as we get older,” says Rodgers. “Applying a toner after cleansing will help draw more moisture into the skin.” And those are just the more universal benefits of using a toner. Depending on the particular formula you pick, your toner can do many more things. For example, toners are a great way to gently exfoliate skin, eliminating the build-up of dead cells that can leave your complexion dull and lackluster as well as ensuring any skin care used afterward absorbs better, notes Roberta Del Campo, MD , a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. Dealing with dark spots or discoloration? Yep, a toner, specifically a brightening formula, can help. It’s all about finding the right one for you. To that point… How to pick a toner based on skin type First, consider what kind of skin you have and what kind of benefits you’re after. If your skin is dry and/or you simply want to add some more moisture, Rogers recommends using one that contains humectants — ingredients such as glycerin and hyaluronic acid. These will attract water to the skin that you can then lock in with moisturizer, she points out. If your skin is oily or you’re still battling breakouts, Dr. Camp recommends formulas with salicylic acid. The beta-hydroxy acid helps to dissolve excess oil and keep pores clear. And for those trying to target irregular texture: “Look for ones that contain alpha-hydroxy acids, such as lactic or glycolic,” says Dr. Camp. “These gently exfoliate to reveal brighter, smoother skin.” To that point, Dr. Del Campo adds that any toner with vitamin C is great for those who are after a more radiant, even tone. A good universal rule of thumb to keep in mind: If your skin is dry and/or sensitive, make sure you pick a toner that’s alcohol-free. “Alcohol-containing toners may remove too much oil and end up causing dryness,” Dr. Camp cautions. How to use a toner A toner should be used immediately after cleansing skin. Pat your face dry, then apply the toner to a cotton ball or pad and gently swipe it across your face, suggests Dr. Camp. Alternatively, apply toner to your (clean) hands and gently press it into skin with your fingertips, he says. Either way, make sure to allow your skin to fully dry before applying your other products. You’ll typically want to follow toner with a serum and/or moisturizer — and sunscreen in the morning, of course. Depending on the formula, most toners can be used twice a day, though Rogers notes that you can also consider using a toner in lieu of a cleanser in the morning. You can also try alternating formulas. Switch between one that’s more exfoliating and one that’s more hydrating, using them on alternating days, advises Dr. Del Campo. Watch the below video from @TabethGiselle on YouTube on how to use toner in your skin care routine.

Best overall toner Fresh Rose & Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Toner Both Dr. Del Campo and Dr. Camp love this option. As the name suggests, it touts nourishing rose oil and rose water , along with hydrating hyaluronic acid . It’s alcohol-free as well — and the pretty packaging (visible rose petals!) is just an added bonus. Best drugstore toner CeraVe Alcohol-Free Hydrating Toner This drugstore buy is one of Rogers’ favorites. She notes that it’s an especially good pick if you have sensitive skin, as it contains calming niacinamide and skin-strengthening ceramides. Dr. Del Campo is also a fan, adding that these ingredients make it a good choice for mature and dry skin types as well, and lauding it for being very cost effective. Best hydrating toner Laneige Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer This aptly-named pick is in fact somewhat of a hybrid. “It combines the benefits of a cream moisturizer and a lightweight toner, delivering nourishing ingredients like ceramides and peptides,” says Dr. Camp of one of his top picks. Hydrating glycerin, squalane and hyaluronic acid also feature prominently on the ingredient list. Best exfoliating toner SkinCeuticuals Equalizing Toner If you’re looking for a toner that will help brighten and smooth your complexion, this is it. It’s a favorite of Dr. Del Campo’s, who likes that it contains alpha-hydroxy acids to gently exfoliate, alongside skin-calming botanical extracts. Also nice is that it’s fragrance-, oil- and alcohol-free. Best antioxidant-rich toner Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Toner “Infused with green tea and hyaluronic acid, this toner offers an abundance of collagen-boosting amino acids, antioxidant protection and hydration,” says Dr. Camp of another one of his favorites. It’s a universally great choice for all skin types, an easy way to score an extra dose of antioxidants that help ward off free radical damage that can cause many different signs of aging. Best splurge toner SK-II Facial Treatment Clear Lotion Toner It’s pricey, yes, but both Dr. Camp and Rogers say this pick is worth every penny. It relies on a fermented ingredient proprietary to the brand that’s ideal for helping keep the skin barrier balanced. “This is important in order to prevent inflammation and sensitivity,” explains Rogers. It’s also rich in antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and amino acids that nourish your skin, adds Dr. Camp. And, on top of all of that, there are also gently exfoliating alpha-hydroxy acids in the mix. Best brightening toner Good Molecules Niacinamide Brightening Toner Say bye-bye to sun spots! “This is a great option for all skin types dealing with dark spots or discoloration as it’s formulated with brightening ingredients like alpha arbutin and licorice root extract,” says Rogers. “Both help to brighten what you see on the surface of the skin, and alpha arbutin also helps inhibit the formation of dark spots below that top layer.” Best toner for sensitive skin Kiehl’s Calendual Herbal Extract Alcohol-Free Toner For a toner that is both alcohol- and fragrance-free (two very important criteria if you have easily-irritated skin), look to this option from Kiehl’s. It also contains botanicals such as calendula, allantoin and great burdock root, which help to not only reduce redness but also improve skin texture, too, notes Dr. Camp.
