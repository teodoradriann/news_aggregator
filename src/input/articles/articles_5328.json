    "text": "UNITED NATIONS | Xinhua | UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday expressed his deep appreciation for the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali as it completed its withdrawal from the country. The UN chief underscored the pivotal role the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) played in bolstering the peace process. The mission was instrumental in ensuring respect for the ceasefire under the 2015 Peace and Reconciliation Agreement, as well as in supporting the transition towards the “restoration of state authority,” Guterres said. The secretary-general expressed his “deepest gratitude” towards the personnel of MINUSMA. The mission’s head El-Ghassim Wane was particularly commended for his “outstanding leadership in a challenging context.” Regarding the human cost of the mission, the secretary-general paid a poignant tribute to the 311 MINUSMA personnel who lost their lives and the over 700 who were injured. “The entire United Nations family stands in sympathy and solidarity with the loved ones, friends, and colleagues of the fallen staff,” he said, honoring their “selfless devotion to the cause of peace.” With the onset of the liquidation period on Jan. 1, 2024, a smaller team will oversee the transportation of assets and the disposal of United Nations equipment in Mali. Guterres has placed his trust in the “full cooperation of the transitional government” to facilitate the effort. Reaffirming the United Nations’ unwavering support to Mali, the UN chief pledged to continue working with the Malian people towards restoring its constitutional order and promoting peace, security, and sustainable development. The Security Council on June 30 adopted resolution 2690 to end MINUSMA’s mandate as of June 30. It requested the mission to immediately start on July 1 the cessation of its operations, transfer of its tasks, as well as the orderly and safe withdrawal of its personnel, with the objective of completing this process by Dec. 31, 2023. MINUSMA, established by Security Council resolution 2100 in April, aims to support political processes in Mali by carrying out security-related tasks. ■ on Saturday expressed his deep appreciation for the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali as it completed its withdrawal from the country.

    "text": "Cloud ransomware attacks are becoming more common, with threat actors finding new ways to exploit large cloud storage services and exfiltrate data, according to a new report from cybersecurity firm SentinelOne.\n\\n According to the company\\u2019s State of Cloud Ransomware in 2024 report, threat researchers at SentinelOne have identified several new tools designed to target web servers with ransomware, but also saw a new trend in attackers using cloud based software to exfiltrate the data they\\u2019ve stolen.\n\\n Although cloud storage services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage are built to safely handle and store large amounts of unstructured data, the researchers said that they have become attractive targets for cyber-attacks due to the number of organisations relying on them.\n\\n SentinelOne found that ransomware attackers are quickly finding and adapting their techniques in what has become a running battle with cloud service providers (CSPs).\n\\n One common method attackers use involves exploiting poorly secured Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, with access gained through stolen credentials or misconfiguration.\n\\n Once inside, the threat actors create a new encryption key using AWS\\u2019s Key Management Service (KMS) to lock the data, then schedule the new key for deletion, giving the victim just seven days to respond before the attacker\\u2019s key, and potentially all of the victim\\u2019s data, is lost forever.\n\\n Notably, the seven-day window before deletion was first implemented by cloud providers themselves as a way to ensure data retention, but has been co-opted by threat actors as a new line of attack.\\xa0\n\\n Aside from ransomware targeting cloud services, the study found that threat actors are turning to cloud services to hold the data they intend to ransom.\n\\n The study highlights several examples of ransomware actors, including those mimicking the notorious LockBit group, using tools like Azure Storage Explorer and Amazon\\u2019s S3 storage services to remove and hold stolen data.\n\\n SentinelLab, SentilOne\\u2019s threat intelligence arm, said it had identified a simple Python script designed to run on Windows systems that would allow attackers to exfiltrate files to the cloud and then encrypt the local versions, although stressed that this method hasn\\u2019t yet been observed in the wild.\n\\n",

We are told in Revelation 18 that the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore.\nWe are also told that every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, will stand at a distance and cry out when they see the smoke of her burning.\nLet's talk about how this prophecy is now being set up right before our eyes. We will look at how World War 3 is really a war of limited economic resources, and we will look talk about the *one thing* that is not on the side of the Anglo-Zionist establishment---time.\nLet's talk about this.\nFor all things Overcome Babylon, check out the links below:\n📱Get the Bible Prophecy Secrets eBook FREE! https://www.bibleprophecyunlocked.com/\n📕 Order your copy of Bible Prophecy Secrets (Ships Worldwide): https://www.bibleprophecyunlocked.com/order-bible-prophecy-secrets\n🔥 Join Kingdom Secrets Academy: https://www.kingdom-secrets.com/academy\n🔗 Breaking News + Announcements, sub to Telegram: https://bit.ly/obtelegram\n🎧 Listen on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3FtkYB6\n☕ Support the channel with a cup of coffee: https://bit.ly/kfe03l85\n🌿 Get ORGANIC Superfood Nutrition: https://www.kingdom-secrets.com/prepare",
