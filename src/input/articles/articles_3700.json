    "title": "Alemanha: trabalhadores da Volkswagen iniciarão greve, diz sindicato",
    "text": "Os funcionários da Volkswagen entrarão em greve na próxima semana, depois que os líderes sindicais e a empresa automobilística alemã não conseguiram chegar a um acordo sobre como cortar custos em meio a um mercado de veículos elétricos lento e com concorrência acirrada, disse uma autoridade sindical nesta sexta-feira, 29.\nUm porta-voz do sindicato IG Metall relevou que os trabalhadores começariam as greves de advertência na segunda-feira, o que fará com que seus membros parem de usar ferramentas por algumas horas por dia. A duração da greve dependerá do progresso das negociações, disse ele.\nA Volkswagen emprega cerca de 300.000 funcionários na Alemanha e opera 10 fábricas no país. A paralisação industrial prevista para começar semana que vem refere-se a cerca de 120.000 funcionários das fábricas de Wolfsburg, Braunschweig, Hanover, Salzgitter, Emden e Kassel, além de algumas subsidiárias.\nA última rodada de negociações entre a Volkswagen e o sindicato terminou sem um acordo e as negociações devem ser retomadas em 9 de dezembro.\nConcorrência Os fabricantes de automóveis europeus estão enfrentando uma concorrência cada vez maior dos carros elétricos chineses de baixo custo. A Volkswagen disse no mês passado que os resultados semestrais da empresa indicavam que ela não atingiria sua meta de € 10 bilhões (R$ 61,6 bilhões) em economia de custos até 2026.\nA Volkswagen tem cerca de 120 mil funcionários na Alemanha, onde possui dez fábricas – seis delas no Estado da Baixa Saxônia, no norte do país, incluindo Wolfsburg.\nO sindicato IG Metall criticou duramente os planos de fechamento informados pela VW. “Esperamos que, em vez de fantasias de cortes, conceitos sustentáveis para o futuro sejam delineados pela Volkswagen e sua gerência na mesa de negociações”, disse o líder sindical regional Thorsten Gröger.\nAs iniciativas adicionais que afetam fábricas ou garantias de emprego seriam negociadas com os representantes dos trabalhadores. O fechamento de uma fábrica seria o primeiro desde que sua planta nos EUA , em Westmoreland, Pensilvânia, foi fechada em 1988, segundo a agência de notícias alemã Dpa.\nCom informações de Estadão Conteúdo\nImagem: Shutterstock",

    "title": "COOKIE DOUGH EASTER EGGS",
    "text": "Cookie Dough Easter Eggs are the perfect no-bake dessert for Easter. Edible cookie dough in the shape of Easter eggs that are dipped in pastel-colored chocolate and then decorated.\nEDIBLE COOKIE DOUGH EASTER EGGS\nI make a lot of cookies. And the cookies are delicious, but I am a bigger fan of the dough than the actual cookies. I’m going to be completely honest and confess that I have consumed quite a bit of regular cookie dough – the kind with raw eggs and non-heat-treated flour, and I’ve survived so far, but I’ve always felt a tiny bit nervous about getting sick from it.\nThese Cookie Dough Easter Eggs are completely safe to eat! It only takes a few minutes to “cook” the flour to reduce any chance of harmful bacteria, and since you aren’t baking the dough, no eggs are required either.\nIngredients in Cookie Dough Easter Eggs\nButter – You will need a half cup (1 stick) of butter to make the cookie dough. I usually use salted butter and it works great. For best results, use real butter.\nBrown sugar – For best results, use brown sugar that is soft and fresh.\nVanilla extract – The higher the quality of vanilla, the better.\nFlour – All-purpose flour works best. Make sure to heat treat before adding to the recipe to make sure any potential bacteria is killed.\nSweetened condensed milk – You will need one 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk. This provides moisture, flavor, and sweetness to the cookie dough.\nChocolate chips – I like to use the mini semisweet chocolate chips, but you can use regular ones if you’d like.\nCandy melts – You will need ½ pound each of blue, yellow, pink, and white candy melts.\nSprinkles – Any pastel-colored sprinkles will work great!\nHow to make Cookie Dough Easter Eggs\nMAKE THE COOKIE DOUGH\nPlace the flour in a large microwave-safe bowl and then microwave for 2 minutes in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each interval. Set aside.\nIn a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the butter and brown sugar together. Mix for 2-3 minutes.\nAdd the vanilla extract and mix for another minute.\nAdd half the flour and sweetened condensed milk and mix to combine.\nAdd the remaining flour and mix until combined.\nStir in the chocolate chips.\nSHAPE THE EASTER EGGS\nShape about 1 ½ – 2 tablespoons of the dough into an egg shape and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. You can shape the dough with your fingers, or you can roll out the dough to be about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick and then use an egg-shaped cookie cutter to cut out the dough.\nCHILL THE DOUGH\nChill the cookie dough eggs in the refrigerator for 2 hours or freeze for an hour.\nWhen the cookie dough eggs are almost completely chilled, begin to melt the candy melts.\nMELT THE CHOCOLATE\nPlace each of the three colors of candy (yellow, pink, and blue) melts in a separate bowl.\nMelt each bowl in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between intervals until each is melted and smooth. To avoid the chocolate hardening up during the dipping process, just melt one color of chocolate at a time.\nDIP & DECORATE THE EGGS\nUsing two forks dip each cookie dough egg into one of the 3 colors and tap off the excess before placing the egg back on the parchment paper.\nRepeat with the rest of the eggs in the 3 colors.\nMelt the white candy melts, drizzle the chocolate over the top of each egg, and immediately sprinkle with sprinkles. Let the chocolate set and then serve immediately or store the eggs in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\nCookie Dough Easter Eggs\n[Rate](#commentform)\nIngredients\n- ½ cup butter softened\n- ¾ cup brown sugar\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 2 cups flour\n- 1 can 14 ounces sweetened condensed milk\n- ½ cup miniature chocolate chips\n- ½ pound blue candy melts\n- ½ pound yellow candy melts\n- ½ pound pink candy melts\n- ½ pound white candy melts\n- Easter sprinkles\nInstructions\n- MAKE THE COOKIE DOUGH: Place the flour in a large microwave-safe bowl and then microwave for 2 minutes in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each interval. Set aside.\n- In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the butter and brown sugar together.

You can heat treat flour in the oven or in the microwave – both methods work great!\nIN THE OVEN\nLine a cookie sheet with parchment paper and spread the flour in a thin layer on the parchment paper. Bake at 300° for about 5-6 minutes. The flour needs to be at a temperature of 160° to be safe. Use a meat thermometer to check and if the temperature isn’t high enough, cook for another 1-2 minutes before checking again.\nIN THE MICROWAVE\nYou can easily heat-treat flour in the microwave as well. This works great as long as you don’t need to treat more than 2-3 cups at a time. Place the flour in a large, microwaveable bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals until the temperature reaches 160°. Stir between intervals to make sure the flour heats evenly. You will probably need to heat the flour for about 2-3 minutes in total.\nOnce the flour is ready, let it cool. Use immediately in a recipe or store in an airtight container until ready to use.\nHOW LONG DO COOKIE DOUGH EASTER EGGS LAST?\nStore these cookie dough eggs in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days. They never last longer than that at my house anyway!\nCAN YOU COOKIE DOUGH EASTER EGGS?\nThese cookie dough eggs are suitable for freezing. Freeze in an airtight container for up to 3 months. You can defrost them in the fridge for several hours before eating or you can set them out at room temperature for about 15-20 minutes. They even taste fantastic frozen too!\nMore delicious Easter recipes to try:\nEaster Chocolate Covered Strawberries Easy Easter M&M Blondies Easter Egg Oreo Balls Easter Egg Sugar Cookies Jumbo Lemon Easter Cookies Cadbury Easter Egg Fudge Easter Peeps Krispie Treats Easter Hot Chocolate Bombs Easter Cookie Cake Easter Bunny KitKat Cake Peanut Butter Easter Eggs Chocolate Mint Easter Eggs Chocolate Nest Easter Cookies Easy Easter Marshmallow Dessert Easter Egg Nests Cadbury Mini Egg Brownies Chocolate-Covered Marshmallow Eggs Mini Egg Rice Krispie Treats Easter Sprinkle Cookies\nCookie Dough Easter Eggs are the perfect no-bake dessert for Easter.

    "title": "KSU Offers First Rural Management MBA in the Country | Education | mdjonline.com",
    "text": "Kennesaw State University is launching a new Rural Management concentration for its Evening Master of Business Administration program in fall 2025.\nThe program, which is the first rural management MBA program in the country, will empower rural communities to create economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for their residents.\nThe University System of Georgia this week approved two new concentrations for the Evening MBA program: Rural Management and Business Intelligence. While both additions allow the MBA program to expand its reach and relevance, the Rural Management concentration is unique in that no other university in the state serves that audience.\n“Rural counties are experiencing incredible growth right now,” said Renee Bourbeau, executive director of MBA programs for KSU’s Michael Coles College of Business. “These communities have a need for qualified professionals to fill leadership positions in business and government. Kennesaw State is proud to be the first university in the country to offer an MBA program specifically tailored to their unique economic position.”\nAs a discipline, rural management involves solving challenges around sustainable agriculture, building and maintaining infrastructure, and ensuring access to healthcare, education and employment.\nBourbeau said the time is right for a program like this. For the first time in a decade, rural counties across America are experiencing population growth, with the U.S. Census Bureau listing two Georgia counties – Jackson and Dawson – among the fastest growing in the country.\n“We’ve seen what can happen in rural communities when there is a leadership vacuum,” Bourbeau said. “When Talking Rock, Ga. lost its mayor in 2021, it led to the city losing its fire station and eventually its fire designation, leading to increased insurance rates for its residents. A program like ours will prepare cities and counties for leadership crises like this.”\nIn addition to the Rural Management Concentration, the USG also approved the creation of an Evening MBA concentration in Business Intelligence. The MBA program has had a certificate program in BI since 2020. The concentration provides MBA students with greater opportunities to gain the analytics skills to become data-driven decision-makers.\n“Business intelligence reflects the tools and technologies to collect, integrate, analyze, and present an organization’s data to create insightful, actionable information,” said Jomon Paul, the Coles College’s associate dean of research and accreditation and the BI program’s lead faculty. “This knowledge prepares professionals to make critical decisions that impact their organization’s effectiveness and bottom line.”\nStudents in either concentration will complete the core MBA classes. Those enrolled in the Rural Management program will also take courses on topics like economic development in rural America and agribusiness strategy. BI students complete courses on business analysis, risk management, big-data analysis and more.\nThese additions join existing MBA concentrations in accounting, digital marketing, finance, fintech, general management, information security and assurance and organizational entrepreneurship and innovation.\n“We are always looking for new ways to adapt our programs to respond to the needs of our students and the business community,” Bourbeau said. “Our concentrations in Rural Management and Business Intelligence expand Kennesaw State into new markets and provide more students with opportunities for career advancement.”\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",

    "text": "Aaron Jones ' departure from Green Bay after seven seasons felt abrupt when it was reported on Monday. His early Tuesday agreement to join the rival Minnesota Vikings was even more jarring.\nBut to the 29-year-old running back, who was introduced alongside Sam Darnold and other newly inked Vikings on Thursday, the intradivision move was simply business.\n\"It's not strange at all. It's football,\" Jones said at his first Minnesota presser. \"I played for many different teams growing up, middle school, high school. You change teams. You change teammates. That's part of the game.\"\nJones continued, \"It's a part of the business. You know what you signed up for. My agent had called me before all of that happened, told me it was a possibility, so my mind was already prepared, and I just wanted to go where I felt wanted. That's here, and I'm excited to be here.\"\nRelated Links 2024 NFL free agency tracker: Latest signings, trades, contract info for all 32 teams Vikings expected to sign QB Sam Darnold to one-year deal worth up to $10 million 2024 NFL free agency deals: Three good fits and three head-scratchers in the frenzy's opening wave The Pro Bowl tailback was released Monday after the Packers agreed to terms with former Las Vegas Raiders running back Josh Jacobs .

Jones, slated to carry a $17.6 million cap hit in 2024, declined a pay cut, and was instead cut for good.\nIn Minnesota, he is joining the enemy. However, Jones says he didn't approach his short foray into free agency with any vindictiveness toward Green Bay.\n\"Just because they didn't re-sign me, it's not fuel to the fire. My fire's already been lit, it's gonna stay lit,\" Jones explained. \"I'm on a mission to be the best running back in the NFL, and I'm glad I get to prove that here in Minnesota with a great organization.\"\nJones inked a $7 million contract to play one season with the Vikings, guaranteeing him two opportunities to play his former team, including one at Lambeau Field. The running back downplayed the drama of a possible revenge game\n\"It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be a lot of fun. Just ball, you know what it is?\" Jones said. \"I've played in hostile situations, hostile areas, whatever, but to me, at the end of that day, it's just gonna be ball. I'm going back to where I used to play at. It's ball. Just go out there and make a statement.\"\nIn his final campaign with the Packers, Jones had a subpar regular season, missing six games due to injury while totaling just 889 yards from scrimmage and three scores after four straight 1,000-yard years. The running back turned it on in the playoffs, racking up 226 rushing yards and three touchdowns, leaving Green Bay with flashes of a younger Jones.\nAfter the whiplash of his brilliant postseason run following by an unceremonious release, that Jones is on to Minnesota.\n\"Honestly, I don't even know who's on their roster,\" Jones said of the Packers. \"After I got released, I've turned straight to the Vikings, and this is my focus. I'm not worried about the Packers. I'm a Minnesota Viking.\"\nThat was made ever more clear with his closing statement: a loud, thundering \"Skol!\"\nWhat a walkoff.\nğŸ™� #Skol @Showtyme_33 pic.twitter.com/Jm4M3xNhES\n— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) March 14, 2024 A week ago, the thought of Jones exclaiming the Vikings' war cry was unthinkable. Now it's a shocking reality.\nWell, to everyone except him.\n\"I'm never surprised by what goes on in the league,\" Jones mused Thursday. \"The longer you stay, the crazier stuff you see.\"",

    "text": "Japan's education ministry plans to restrict living expenses support for doctoral students to Japanese nationals only, a panel proposal showed Thursday after parliamentary debate over foreign students accounting for over a third of recipients of the public grants.\nThe plan to abolish foreigners' access to living subsidies of 1.8 million yen ($12,400) to 2.4 million yen per annum is expected to take effect in fiscal 2027, pending approval from a committee.\nAccording to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, 10,564 people received the subsidies in fiscal 2024, of whom 4,125, around 39 percent, were from overseas. Chinese nationals made up 76% of the non-Japanese cohort at 3,151 people.\nIn March, the findings were raised during a parliamentary session by a lawmaker who called for the funds to be limited to Japanese nationals in principle.\nThe government launched a support program in fiscal 2021 to boost the number of doctoral students by supporting their living and research expenses.\nThe proposal presented at a meeting of panel members says that the changes \"reflect the program's aims to ease Japanese students' worries about their financial situations to enable them to advance to doctoral study,\" adding that many foreign students fund their education privately.\nForeign students will remain eligible for research support of up to 1.1 million yen under the program.\nRelated coverage:\nU.S. to resume issuing int'l student visas, add tougher online checks\nJapan draws up 100 bil. yen policy to attract foreign researchers",

    "text": "Enrique Cerezo, presidente del Atlético de Madrid, volvió a mostrarse crítico con el VAR en un momento en el que está en boca de todos. La polémica del encuentro entre el Real Madrid y el Almería, unido a los audios que se pueden escuchar y los que se han filtrado está provocando que se encuentre en su peor momento desde que se instauró.\nEl dirigente colchonero siempre se ha mostrado contrario al VAR. “No voy a hacer ningún comentario sobre lo que ha pasado en los últimos días con el VAR. Todos ven cómo, y cuál es su sistema. Pero como todos están de acuerdo en que continúe el VAR yo no voy a ser la persona que esté luchando y saque una bandera en contra del VAR. No me gusta, da más problemas que resultados”, explicó sobre el asunto.\nUna postura que desarrolló con la siguiente reflexión: “Cuando haces una gestión nueva con un sistema nuevo como es el VAR es para que te de garantías de que todo va a ser más justo, más verdadero y más sensato y no lo es”.\nEso si, no considera que la competición esté adulterada. “No estamos preocupados con nada. Todo el mundo sufre en el tema del VAR y en el tema de los árbitros pero nadie quiere decir que no puede continuar el VAR”.\nNo quiso entrar en la polémica por los audios porque aseguró que “no los escucho. Para mí los partidos se acaban en el momento que el árbitro pita el final en el minuto 90, 98 o 100 como pasa ahora, ahí es cuando acaba para mí el partido”.\nHernández Hernández volverá al VAR en el partido entre el Atlético y el Sevilla, después de la polémica por el Real Madrid-Almería del domingo. En este caso Cerezo tampoco quiso entrar. “Hay una serie de gente que controla a los árbitros y el VAR y si consideran que debe estar, pues me imagino que estará. Yo no puedo decidir si puede estar o no estar. Si lo deciden sus superiores que esté será porque es bueno”.\nPor último, también le preguntaron por la crisis que atraviesa el Barcelona. “Todos los equipos pasan por problemas. Unos al principio, otros a mitad de temporada y otros al final. Nosotros lo tuvimos al principio, ahora estamos mejor. Ahora lo está teniendo el Barcelona, y todos los equipos acaban en esta misma racha”, concluyó.",
