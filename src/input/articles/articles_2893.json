    "text": "A atriz [Gorete Milagres,](https://observatoriodatv.uol.com.br/noticias/eterna-filo-gorete-milagres-fala-sobre-o-seu-hiato-na-tv-no-auge-do-sucesso-fui-tirada-do-ar) de 60 anos, que ficou conhecida nacionalmente por sua personagem Filomena nos anos 90, está celebrando os 30 anos de estreia de sua icônica empregada doméstica. Em entrevista ao site da jornalista [Heloisa Tolipan](https://heloisatolipan.com.br/tv/gorete-milagres-celebra-30-anos-de-filomena-arrepende-se-de-nao-ter-ido-para-a-globo-e-diz-fui-muito-caluniada/), a comediante relembrou de quando saiu de um quadro da A Praça é Nossa para um programa próprio no SBT e a polêmica contratação da TV Globo no auge de sua carreira na televisão. Veja também: “Foi difícil. Eu estava começando e tudo era muito novo. Tomei uma decisão no começo e depois acabei me arrependendo, mas o tempo me ensinou muita coisa. Acabei fazendo, na Globo a novela “Malhação”, programas no Multishow [que é do Grupo Globo], viram a profissional que eu era e me chamaram para trabalhar. Tive um impacto no momento”, contou a artista. Gorete Milagres também relembrou uma passagem pelo programa Teleton, no qual foi xingada por outra artista mais velha por ter ficado mais tempo no ar pelo motivo de ter agradado a audiência que acompanhava o programa, na época. “Quando entrei eram poucas mulheres no mercado. Não é fácil ser humorista mulher. Vi numa série uma atriz que foi sabotada no Teleton estrangeiro e lembrei que eu mesma fui no daqui. Uma artista veterana me xingou dizendo que fiquei muito tempo cantando no programa, caracterizada como Filomena, ainda que a ordem fosse eu ficar por que minha participação estava se vertendo em doações para o programa. Hoje vejo as mulheres sobressaindo, ganhando espaço”, relatou ela. Ainda na entrevista, a artista destacou a sua passagem vitoriosa pela emissora de Silvio Santos com uma das personagens mais marcantes da história da comédia brasileira e que não guarda mágoas sobre o fim de seu sitcom no canal. “Não entrei pro humor através de panelinha ou clubinho. Sempre fui muito independente. Fui campeã de audiência, conquistei milhões de pessoas e já conquistei tudo o que eu queria. Não preciso ficar correndo atrás de likes. Já conquistei o que tinha que ter conquistado. A saída da Filomena do ar foi um jogo de poder, mas é algo do passado. Não guardo mágoas em nada e só tenho a agradecer ao Sílvio Santos e a todos com quem eu trabalhei e me deram oportunidade. Rezo para todos”, completou Gorete Milagres.",
