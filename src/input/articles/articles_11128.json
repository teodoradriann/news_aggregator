    "text": "Scientists discover animal species not sighted for 185 years and thought to be extinct: “we can finally confirm it”\nThere is much concern about the accelerated pace of extinctions globally, so when a species is rediscovered, it gives hope to conservationists.\nAs humans have an ever greater impact on the natural environment, concerns continue to mount about the future of many plant and animal species. Scientists found that within a matter of decades around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction according to a UN report.\nThat same report was not all doom and gloom but also found that ”it is not too late to make a difference,” said Sir Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), “but only if we start now at every level from local to global.” So when a creature that was thought to be extinct is rediscovered, it gives hope to conservationists. Such is the case of the Asian small-clawed otter, whose presence in Nepal has been confirmed for the first time in over 185 years.\n“After years of speculation… We can finally confirm that the small-clawed otter lives on in the country”\nThe confirmation of the Asian small-clawed otter in Nepal follows the aquatic animal’s rediscovery in Darjeeling, India in 2022. That had sparked hopes that it would be found again in eastern Nepal, which shares a similar topography, said Mohan Bikram Shrestha of the Otter Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) speaking to Mongabay.\nFlounder the Asian small-clawed otter snacking on shrimp 🦐. Asian small-clawed otters are opportunistic feeders with a varied diet. They primarily enjoy aquatic prey, such as crustaceans, mollusks, fish, insects, and small amphibians.\n— Cincinnati Zoo (@CincinnatiZoo)[pic.twitter.com/vzKl7rLIN0][February 17, 2025]\nThere have been sightings in the east of Nepal, but none have been confirmed yet. In the end, the smallest of the 13 otter species showed up in the west of the Himalayan nation. “After years of speculation about its presence in Nepal, we can finally confirm that the small-clawed otter lives on in the country,” he told the outlet.\nThe otter in question was discovered by forestry department officials in Dadeldhura district who found the juvenile “in a fragile and injured state,” Shrestha explained, so they decided to feed and nurse it. However, they didn’t know which species it belonged to so they sought help from the IUCN Otter Specialist Group. After sharing images and video of the otter the group confirmed that it was a small-clawed otter.\nThe discovery of the small-claw otter is not only exciting in that it is not extinct in Nepal, but also that it is an excellent biological indicator species. “They are highly sensitive to habitat disturbance — ranging from destruction to pollution — and their numbers give scientists an indication of the general health of their environment,” says the Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute.\nThe Otter Specialist Group is working to get the small-claw otter added to Nepal’s Aquatic Animal Protection Act, so that it can enjoy the protections afforded to the Eurasian and smooth-coated otters which are currently included. These creatures and other aquatic species have been negatively affected by “severe degradation of Nepal’s rivers due to overexploitation.”\nWhile the presence of the smooth-coated otters has never been in question, that of the Eurasian otter was only confirmed to inhabit the country in 2021. Since the confirmation of the Eurasian otter in Nepal, multiple sightings have been reported around the country. “We hope that the discovery of the small-clawed otter in western Nepal would trigger a similar flurry of reports,” said Shrestha.\nGet your game on!

    "text": "WHILE we Malaysians love food, we also like to gripe about food. And lately, it has been about rising food prices, especially at the food festival where food operators have been coming up with excuses like high site rental among many others.\nNetizen Roman Akramovich said that Federal Territories Minister Dr Zaliha Mustapha has removed the middle man, with Kuala Lumpur City Hall taking over the operation at RM500 for rental.\nNo other elaboration has been made regarding this, but netizens in general were sceptical that lower rents will solve the problem.\nDulu peniaga kata harga makanan mahal sebab bayar sewa tapak mahal. Ok, kita terima alasan tu.\nTahun ini YB\n[@DrZalihaMustafa]sudah tendang keluar orang tengah, sewa terus dengan DBKL RM500 sahaja.Tapi kalau harga makanan tetap mahal, kita mahu\n[@KPDN_HQ]ambil tindakan.[https://t.co/Pp8F3uBEiT]— Roman Akramovich (@SyedAkramin)\n[January 29, 2025]\n“Even from last time, people who don’t pay for rents will sell like they paid for rents,” said netizen WTF.\nفاريس added that before, the sellers gave the excuse of raw material being expensive.\nYet after the government controls the price of raw materials to make it cheap, they still sell it at an exorbitant price.\nAnother netizen claimed that the rise of food prices will ultimately be blamed on the government.\n“Oh, don’t worry. Our businessmen are sneaky like the Zionis and they will find a thousand and one excuses to up the price even though there is no logic,” said Lazuli.\n“But we use premium materials, homemade and viral too,” said BurizaDoKyanonz, likely in an attempt at sarcasm.\nThen there was a satirical comment from J A S Z. A Z R A N, who said it was all the fault of Anwar and the DAP.\nAlso, SAEDAH suggested that such stalls should be blacklisted and not to issue them a license next year.\nThe topic took a turn into the beloved Roti John, with netizen ben stating that the price of Roti John with egg will reach RM10 this year.\nM.izwan added that Roti John is normally sold at RM6 to RM8, but it will become RM12 to RM15 upon entering the bazaar.\nPerhaps then, the best course of action is to avoid such places? Finally, a prudent netizen pointed out a tip on buying during the Ramadhan month.\n“Don’t buy from these businesses that have gone viral,” she said, but instead make purchases from those people who the customer is already familiar with. —Jan 3, 2025\nMain image: Hungry Fish Eye",

    "text": "[Cybersecurity Spending](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cybersecurity-spending-c-664) , [Government](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/government-c-524) , [Industry Specific](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/industry-specific-c-515) FBI Calls for Increased Funding to Counter CyberthreatsFBI Director Chris Wray Warns US Falling Behind to Adversaries in Cyberspace FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional panel Thursday the United States faces a wide range of \"escalated\" digital threats, including sophisticated cyberattacks and emerging risks to networks and critical infrastructure. See Also: [Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions with Permissioned DeFi](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/revolutionizing-cross-border-transactions-permissioned-defi-w-13548?rf=RAM_SeeAlso) Wray urged the House Committee on Appropriations to support his agency's budget request of $11.3 billion, telling lawmakers the funding will in part support the FBI's efforts to counter cyberthreats from nation-states, hostile foreign intelligence services and cybercriminals \"Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge for the FBI, especially as technology evolves,\" Wray said in his opening remarks, adding that threat actors are exploiting technologies to infiltrate U.S. networks, attack critical infrastructure sectors \"and create chaos.\" International cybercrime groups and hostile nation-states are continuing to advance their hacking techniques in recent years, according to Wray, from selling malware as a service to targeting specific providers to access large volumes of victims and maximize impact. Wray attributed a series of countermeasures for taking down several prominent hacking groups, including a court-authorized operation in January that allowed the FBI to disrupt the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Volt Typhoon (see: [Here's How the FBI Stopped a Major Chinese Hacking Campaign](/heres-how-fbi-stopped-major-chinese-hacking-campaign-a-24234)). The FBI took over 1,000 actions against cyber adversaries throughout 2023, Wray told lawmakers, including convictions, arrests, dismantlements of hacking groups and disruptions of major cyber campaigns. The agency increasingly provided individualized threat warnings and joint advisories with U.S. cyber authorities like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as FBI Liaison Alert System - or FLASH - reports, private industry notifications and public service announcements. The agency has also been working to expand and streamline information sharing processes with the private sector, according to Wray, who told lawmakers: \"We need the private sector to come forward to warn us and our partners when they see malicious cyber activity.\" The FBI director warned the U.S. was falling behind its adversaries when it comes to cyber capabilities, as governments in Beijing and Moscow invest heavily in their digital and counterintelligence divisions. \"To quantify what we are up against: the [People's Republic of China] has a bigger hacking program than every other major nation combined,\" Wray said, saying that Beijing's cyber division outnumbers that of the FBI by at least 50 to one. Wray said the appropriations for fiscal year 2025 will ultimately dictate \"what resources can apply to counter the growing PRC cyberthreat, especially as 2027, the year that the Chinese Communist Party has targeted for a potential invasion of Taiwan, approaches.\" The FBI's fiscal year 2025 budget request includes $7 million to enhance the agency's cyber response capabilities. The proposal also includes an additional $17.8 million and 44 positions, including intelligence analysts, to help combat threats associated with potentially hostile intelligence services and foreign government actors. \"The FBI is engaged in myriad efforts to combat cyberthreats,\" Wray said. \"We take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.\"",

    "text": "While more than 3 million people in Florida lost power in the wake of Hurricane Milton, residents living in a recently built neighborhood in the small town of Cortez saw their houses switch to batteries that powered lights, refrigerators and other essentials, Fast Company reports.\nThe same thing happened two weeks ago, when flooding from Hurricane Helene took out the grid. Though the development, called Hunters Point , is only two years old, it’s already been through—and survived—four major hurricanes.\nIts homes were specifically designed to survive hurricanes, with an elevation high enough to avoid severe flooding, and construction choices that make them as sturdy as possible in high winds. And when the power goes out, each home turns to its own solar panels and battery system.\nIn an outage, the batteries disconnect from the grid and form a “nanogrid” at the house. “That all happens in about a third of a second,” says Geoff Ferrell, vice president at Sonnen, the company that makes the battery systems used at Hunters Point. “From the customer’s experience, they might see the lights flicker. Generally speaking, you don’t have to go reset the clock on your oven. It’s that fast.”\nRead the full story.",

    "text": "CONSUMER AFFAIRS\nTrader Joe's Issues Urgent Statement: Recalls a Product and Asks You Not to Eat It\nTrader Joe's urgently recalls one of its top frozen sellers in the United States\nTrader Joe's has issued an urgent statement in the United States announcing the recall of one of its best-selling frozen products. The company warned that its organic açaí bowls could be contaminated with plastic fragments, posing a risk to consumers.\nThe announcement was published on February 14, asking customers to dispose of the product or return it to the store for a full refund. Trader Joe's hasn't specified how many products have been affected, in which states they have been distributed, or the production dates.\n\"As a precaution, we ask you to discard any Trader Joe's Organic Acai Bowl. It may contain foreign material (plastic), or return it to your nearest store for a full refund.\" This was the company's information in its official statement. So far, no injuries or health issues related to this product have been reported.\nNot the First Time: Other Recent Recalls at Trader Joe's\nIn recent months, Trader Joe's has had to recall several from the market for various safety reasons.\nOne of the most concerning cases occurred with tuna cans sold at Trader Joe's, Walmart, and H-E-B. A defect in the lid could cause leaks or contamination with clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that can cause severe food poisoning.\nAnother incident occurred with steamed chicken soup dumplings. On that occasion, 61,839 lbs. (28,058 kg) of product were recalled because they contained plastic fragments from a permanent marker.\nIn August 2024, Trader Joe's also recalled 653,000 mango and tangerine scented candles due to a design defect. The company warned that the candle's flame could extend more than expected and pose a fire risk.\nTrader Joe's Takes Measures for Consumers\nTrader Joe's has asked consumers to check their freezers and discard any organic açaí bowls they have purchased. They also offer the option to return it to the nearest store for a full refund.\nFor more information about the recall, customers can contact Trader Joe's customer service at (626) 599-3817.\nThis new recall reflects the importance of companies maintaining high food safety standards. Although the company hasn't reported any serious incidents related to the açaí bowl, the recommendation remains not to consume the product. It's always better to prevent than to cure, much better to be cautious and avoid a visit to the doctor or the emergency room.\n➡️ Consumer Affairs\nMore posts:",

    "text": "Today, Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE), released the following statement after a report from the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found and the IRS subsequently confirmed it does not plan to decommission and replace the vast majority of the agency's outdated information systems.\n\"Modernization of antiquated IRS systems is badly needed to improve taxpayer service and better protect Americans’ personal data. Yet, the latest TIGTA report and subsequent IRS response once again reveal the misaligned priorities of the Biden-Harris IRS and their failure to serve American taxpayers. The administration’s continued pursuit of unauthorized tax prep services and schemes to audit more Americans across the income spectrum, including new ways to audit the tips received by service workers, above basic needs like IT and customer service improvements is another reminder of how little respect they have for hardworking families across the country.\"\nBACKGROUND:\nIn January 2023, Reps. Adrian Smith and Michelle Steel's (R-CA) bill to repeal the Biden Administration’s $80 billion IRS expansion, the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, became the first bill passed by the House in the 118th Congress. That bill would also preserve funding for customer service and IT modernization at IRS.\n###\nIssues : Taxes Ways & Means",
