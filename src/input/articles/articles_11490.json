Sign in\nPepperstone\nTrade Now\nCALGARY, AB, Feb. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Kineticor Asset Management LP (\"Kineticor\") is pleased to announce that Pembina Pipeline Corporation (\"Pembina\") (TSX: PPL) (NYSE: PBA) has entered into agreements for a 50 percent interest in the Greenlight Electricity Centre Limited Partnership (\"Greenlight LP\" or \"Greenlight\"), a special-purpose limited partnership with Kineticor Holdings LP #3, a portfolio company of OPTrust.\nGreenlight LP is developing the Greenlight Electricity Centre (\"GLEC\" or \"Project\") which is a proposed multi-phased gas-fired combined cycle power generation facility of up to 1,800 MW with carbon capture optionality coupled with significant land holdings that can accommodate a co-located 1,800 MW data centre complex. The Project would be constructed on land already zoned for heavy industrial use and strategically located near transmission lines, utility infrastructure, carbon sequestration, and fiber in Alberta's Industrial Heartland.\nThe GLEC is managed by Kineticor, which successfully developed, constructed, and currently operates the 900 MW Cascade Power Plant near Edson, Alberta.\n\"We are excited to be partnering with Kineticor and for the opportunity to further extend our value chain to provide power to a promising new Alberta-based data centre industry,\" said Stu Taylor, Pembina's Senior Vice President & Corporate Development Officer. \"In addition to our direct investment in Greenlight, Pembina is well positioned to leverage its existing and future asset base to further support the project. The proximity of our Alliance Pipeline offers a potential opportunity to provide natural gas supply to the GLEC, and the potential future development of the Alberta Carbon Grid may provide a future emissions reduction solution.\"\n\"We are thrilled to partner with Pembina on this transformative project,\" said Andrew Plaunt, CEO of Kineticor. \"Alberta's Industrial Heartland is one of the best locations in the province to facilitate a project of this magnitude given the large land base, robust grid infrastructure, and potential for decarbonization solutions over time. By partnering with Pembina, we can leverage and combine our individual strengths and experience in major infrastructure projects to bring all the pieces together to develop a world class facility.\"\nPower Generation to Support Alberta's Growing Data Centre Demand\nThe GLEC is one of the largest and most advanced baseload power developments in Alberta. Designed to meet the increasing electricity needs driven by the province's growing data centre industry, the facility will be developed in modular phases of approximately 450 MW each to scale with market demand, up to a maximum initial nameplate design of 1,800 MW. The power generation facility is currently in Stage 3 of the Alberta Electric System Operator (\"AESO\") interconnection process, and is progressing through permitting, design, and contracting. GLEC has the optionality to supply power to a co-located data centre or feed directly into Alberta's power grid to support data centre loads across the province.\nData Centre Development and Power Offtake Agreements\nGreenlight is well progressed on an 1,800 MW load application with the AESO on the lands surrounding the GLEC and is targeting grid interconnection in early 2027. Greenlight is actively engaging with numerous customers regarding locating their data centres on GLEC lands and/or procuring long-term power offtake from the Project. GLEC offers prospective customers speed to market and ample ability to scale their growth with reliable and cost-effective power supply. Located near Edmonton, AB which has a highly skilled local labour force, GLEC is an ideal site to execute a project of this scale, all while driving investment and innovation in Alberta.\nSupporting Alberta's Vision for a Thriving Data Centre Industry\nThe Government of Alberta has set an ambitious target of attracting $100 billion in data centre investments by 2030, encouraging developers to \"bring their own power.\" Pembina and Kineticor are committed to supporting this vision by delivering reliable and cost-effective power solutions at scale to data centres looking to locate in the province.\nAbout Kineticor Asset ManagementKineticor Asset Management is a leading developer, manager, and operator of power generation facilities within Alberta.

    "text": "界面新闻记者 | 翟瑞民\n针对近期高温闷热天气，国家疾病预防控制局和中国气象局联合发布首个国家级高温健康风险预警，其中江苏、山东等5省份部分地区属于红色预警。\n据国家疾控局消息，2025年7月2日18时，国家疾病预防控制局和中国气象局联合发布首个国家级高温健康风险预警，旨在贯彻落实《国家气候变化健康适应行动方案（2024-2030年）》中关于提升气候变化健康适应能力，推动建立以气候变化健康早期预警为先导的适应联动机制等相关要求，将气象预警与公共卫生干预有效结合，筑起全民健康防线。公众可通过《新闻联播天气预报》等渠道第一时间掌握。\n根据预警，预计7月2日20时至3日20时，华北南部、黄淮、江淮、江汉、江南北部、东北地区北部及内蒙古、新疆等地高温健康风险较高（黄色预警）；江苏、山东、河南、安徽、黑龙江等地的部分地区高温健康风险高（橙色预警）；其中，江苏北部、山东中东部、河南东部、安徽北部、黑龙江东北部等地的部分地区高温健康风险极高（红色预警）。\n7月3日6时，中央气象台继续发布高温黄色预警：预计7月3日白天，华北南部、黄淮、江淮、江汉、江南大部、四川东南部、重庆、华南北部等地有35℃以上的高温天气，其中，河北南部、山东北部和西南部、河南大部、安徽、江苏、重庆大部、湖北东南部和西部、湖南北部、江西大部、浙江中西部、福建中西部等地的部分地区最高气温37-39℃，浙江西北部、新疆吐鲁番等地局地可达40℃以上。\n中国天气网还发文表示，未来一周，在副热带高压的掌控下，以江南地区为中心，高温天气将大面积向外扩展，华北南部、黄淮至江南、华南的大部地区都将体验“蒸桑拿”，山东、河南、安徽、江苏、湖北、浙江等地还可能出现40℃及以上的酷热天气。不仅白天热，不少地方夜间最低气温也可达30℃左右，可谓是昼蒸夜煮连轴热。\n国家疾控局介绍，高温健康风险预警分为5个风险等级：低风险、中等风险、较高风险、高风险、极高风险。其分级标准是根据高温与循环系统疾病、呼吸系统疾病的超额死亡率的暴露反应关系分析得到的。该产品不再用全国统一的阈值来衡量各地的风险级别，能够体现区域性特征，将为各地区公众做好高温健康风险防范提供指导。\n该项预警与公众熟悉的高温预警有何不同？据中国天气网消息，中国气象局公共气象服务中心副首席李怡介绍，与气象部门发布的常规高温预警不同，高温健康风险预警更多表征了高温对健康的影响，与疾病风险关联，反映了温度升高可能导致疾病风险的增加。\n李怡表示，高温健康风险预警产品不再用全国统一的阈值来衡量各地的风险级别，能够体现区域性特征，也更能够识别东北地区和西北地区等非典型高温高影响区域的高温过程对人体健康的影响。\n中国疾控中心环境所副所长李湉湉对新华社表示，在该所研发的高温健康风险预报预警模型基础上，疾控部门与气象部门以人群健康风险为导向联合研发了该产品。公众可及时关注信息变化，使用好这份预警，按照风险等级采取相应措施，包括保持室内凉爽、避开高温时段外出、减少户外活动、保证充足饮水等，更好地防护高温带来的不利健康影响。\n据悉，气象部门将通过“天和”气象服务系统制作高温健康风险预警信息，并通过国家突发事件预警信息发布系统12379手机短信、手机客户端等渠道发送至国家级各部门应急责任人，同时通过微博、抖音等多渠道向公众广泛传播。\n未经正式授权严禁转载本文，侵权必究。 点赞 收藏 看评论 沉浸模式 评论\n暂无评论哦，快来评价一下吧！ 下载 界面新闻\n微信公众号\n微博",

    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) — During these freezing conditions, the Oklahoma Standard is on full display for some pet owners experiencing homelessness in the OKC metropolitan area. A group called [Angel Fund OKC](https://www.facebook.com/AngelFundOkc) donated blankets and dog kennels to the Homeless Alliance in Oklahoma City. \"If you own a dog or a cat, that pet is important to you,\" Taylor Self with the Homeless Alliance said. \"It's also important to our clients. Many of them are pet owners. So it's also important to us when we're caring for them, we also need to care for their pets.\" The Homeless Alliance saw the forecasted temperatures this weekend, and gave Misty Wilson's group a call. \"I got a phone call from a volunteer asking how fast they thought we could get kennels and blankets,\" Wilson said. \"I said, 'Well, I don't know. Let's try.\" Angel Fund OKC started a [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/homeless-shelter-needs-place-for-pets-too?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unknown&utm_campaign=comms_gfm+homeless-shelter-needs-place-for-pets-too) Wednesday, January 10. It raised $900 within its first 18 hours of launching. The group donated blankets and 22 new dog kennels to the Homeless Alliance on Friday, January 12. \"If it means saving a dog, awesome, but if it means saving a dog's owner, even better,\" Wilson said. Self says this makes a huge difference for people who carry everything they have with them at all times. \"The idea of a dog kennel is not a super mobile thing either,\" Self said. \"So, not only are you worried about being inside and warming yourself up. It's also having a place for your belongings, for your pet, for all of your things.\" With these donations, the Homeless Alliance is turning their day shelter classroom into a dog room. \"A lot of our clients who have pets, you'll see them take care of their pets before they take care of themselves. They care about them. They're their chosen family. I think that now that they know their pets are being cared for, that there's a place for them to be, that's something they don't have to worry about. That's something we're honored to provide.\" Self tells Fox 25 her shelter is always [in need of donations](https://www.homelessalliance.org/donate), including dog treats, leashes, collars, blankets and beds.",
