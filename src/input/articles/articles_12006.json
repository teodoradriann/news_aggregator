    "text": "تكنولوجيا\n«واتساب» يتحدى روسيا: لن نتخلى عن التشفير رغم محاولات الحجب\nاتهم تطبيق المراسلة \"واتساب\"، المملوك لشركة \"ميتا\"، السلطات الروسية بمحاولة حجب خدماته، بسبب تمسكه بحق المستخدمين في التواصل الآمن.\nوأكدت الشركة في بيان، عزمها مواصلة العمل على توفير خدمات التشفير من طرف إلى طرف في روسيا.\nوأضافت إن \"واتساب تطبيق خاص، ويعتمد التشفير التام بين الطرفين، ويتصدى لمحاولات الحكومات انتهاك حق الناس في التواصل الآمن، ولهذا السبب تحاول روسيا حجب خدماته عن أكثر من 100 مليون مستخدم روسي\".\nوشدد واتساب: \"سنواصل القيام بكل ما في وسعنا لجعل خدمات الاتصال المشفرة متاحة للجميع، بما في ذلك في روسيا\".\nقيود على مكالمات واتساب وتليغرام\nوجاءت هذه التصريحات بعد أن بدأت روسيا في تقييد بعض المكالمات عبر تطبيقي \"تليغرام\" و\"واتساب\"، متهمة المنصات الأجنبية بعدم التعاون مع جهات إنفاذ القانون في قضايا الاحتيال والإرهاب.\nونقلت وكالة \"ريا نوفوستي\" الرسمية عن هيئة الرقابة على الاتصالات أن القرار يهدف إلى \"مكافحة المجرمين\"، متهمة التطبيقين بتسهيل عمليات احتيال و\"إشراك مواطنين روس في أعمال تخريب وأنشطة إرهابية\".\nوتسعى موسكو إلى إلزام تطبيقات المراسلة بإتاحة الوصول إلى بيانات المستخدمين بناءً على طلب السلطات، ليس فقط للتحقيق في قضايا الاحتيال، وإنما أيضًا في أنشطة تعتبرها الحكومة \"إرهابية\".\nوأكدت وزارة التكنولوجيا الرقمية أن خدمات المكالمات ستُستعاد فور التزام التطبيقات بالتشريعات الروسية.\nوتأتي هذه الخطوة في ظل تصعيد تشريعي، إذ وقع الرئيس فلاديمير بوتين أواخر يوليو/تموز قانونًا جديدًا يفرض عقوبات على البحث عن محتوى مصنف \"متطرف\" عبر الإنترنت، ويحظر الترويج لشبكات الـVPN التي يستخدمها الروس على نطاق واسع للتحايل على القيود.\nومنذ عام 2024، أصبح الوصول إلى منصة \"يوتيوب\" في روسيا ممكنًا فقط عبر الشبكات الافتراضية الخاصة، فيما حُظرت منصتا \"فيسبوك\" و\"إنستغرام\" عام 2022 بعد تصنيف شركة \"ميتا\" المالكة لهما كـ\"منظمة متطرفة\" داخل البلاد.\naXA6IDIxMi4yMzUuMTUuMTUwIA== جزيرة ام اند امز",

    "title": "Two Israeli-Americans missing since Oct. 7 confirmed killed in Hamas attack - Jewish News",
    "text": "Two Israeli-Americans missing since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel have been confirmed killed, their kibbutz has disclosed.\nJudith Weinstein, 70, a member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was fatally wounded during the terrorist invasion of southern Israel, Nir Oz said on Thursday. The statement confirmed her death, but did not say if she had died the same day.\nLast week, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a volunteer group that represents Israelis held captive by Hamas, said Weinstein’s husband, Gadi Haggai, 72, had been killed.\nTheir bodies are being held in Gaza. Before the news of their deaths, their family had hoped they were still alive while in captivity.\nThe kibbutz and hostage advocacy group did not provide information on how the couple’s deaths had been determined. Their deaths were confirmed by Israel’s Government Press Office, an official government body that coordinates between the Israeli government and media.\nOn the morning of Oct. 7, Weinstein and Haggai left Nir Oz to take their routine morning walk through the fields and orchards around the kibbutz. Security camera footage showed the pair walking out of a kibbutz gate shortly after 6 a.m. The attack started around an hour later.\nDuring the Hamas attack, Weinstein sent a message to friends saying that she and Haggai had been wounded by gunfire, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. Weinstein also called the Magen David Adom emergency response corps after the couple had been wounded.\n“They came on the road,” Weinstein, referring to the terrorists, said during the call, according to Israel’s Channel 12 news. “There were a lot of motorcyclists with live weapons and they shot us. We lied down and they shot me in the face and hand.”\nWeinstein (referred to as “Judih” in some reports) was born in Goshen, New York and moved with her family to Toronto when she was 3. She also held Canadian citizenship, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\nWeinstein was an English teacher for special needs students at the Nofei Habsor high school in the neighboring community of Magen. She also taught children to cope with anxiety caused by the conflict through meditation and mindfulness, said the Eshkol Regional Council, the local governing authority.\nHaggai, whose mother was born and raised in Manhattan and whose father is from Detroit, was a flute player and composer who performed in a military band during his Israel Defense Forces service. He worked as Nir Oz’s dining hall chef. The couple met shortly after Haggai’s release from the military while Weinstein was volunteering on Kibbutz Ein Hashofet, Haggai’s hometown, Nir Oz said.\nThe pair performed together around Israel in a music ensemble called Jazz Alliance, the kibbutz said, describing them as a dedicated couple who “couldn’t be more perfect for each other.”\nThe couple had four children and seven grandchildren.\nThe couple’s daughter, Iris Haggai Liniado, mourned her parents in a Facebook post on Thursday. She described her frantic search for her parents’ whereabouts after the attack, but said she had suspected her mother had been killed because Weinstein was an elderly woman who was not released with other hostages in an exchange deal last month. Liniado said she realized her mother had been killed when she was informed that Haggai was dead.\n“There isn’t a second of the day that I’m not in Oct. 7,” she wrote. “I need to process that I don’t have a mother and a father anymore. That I won’t hear your voices anymore.”\n“What an inspiration you were together. You completed each other,” she wrote, adding that news of their deaths had at least brought the family some closure.\nLiniado criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he had not spoken to her, while President Joe Biden had spoken with her twice.\nBiden mourned Weinstein’s death in a Thursday statement, saying, “This tragic development cuts deep.”\n“I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me,” Biden said. “They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal.”\nBiden said in a statement last week that he was “heartbroken” by news of Haggai’s death.\nIsraeli authorities believe 129 hostages remain in Gaza, not all of whom are alive. Last month, 105 captives were released from Gaza during a brief truce. Four other hostages were released before the truce, and one was rescued by Israeli forces.\nNir Oz was one of the hardest-hit communities in the Hamas attack, with around 80 of its 400 residents taken hostage and 25 killed during the attack.\n ",
