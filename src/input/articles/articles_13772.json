Frayeur à Bercy. Selon les éléments recueillis par TF1/LCI, [ confirmant une information d'Europe 1](https://www.europe1.fr/Police-Justice/info-europe-1-un-journaliste-russe-interpelle-dans-le-ministere-des-finances-en-train-de-prendre-des-photos-4252608), un individu s'est introduit, jeudi 13 juin, dans le ministère de l'Économie et des Finances. L'homme aurait été repéré aux alentours de 13h30 devant le bureau du chef de cabinet de la Direction générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des fraudes (DGCCRF). Selon la responsable du ministère, qui a alerté les policiers, l'individu \"semblait vouloir prendre des photos\", mais n'en était pas sûre en raison de la barrière de la langue. Intercepté par les forces de l'ordre, l'homme a présenté ses documents d'identité. Âgé de 70 ans, il s'avère que l'individu est un réfugié biélorusse, également porteur d'une carte de presse délivrée par \"l'observateur russe\". Selon le rapport de police, le septuagénaire aurait \"très certainement profité du passage d'un employé ou de l'ouverture du portillon\" pour enter dans les locaux, sans toutefois être affirmatif. Aucun vol ni aucune dégradation n'ont été commis. L'individu a finalement été emmené au commissariat du 13e arrondissement de Paris pour une vérification d'identité. Après une fouille de son téléphone portable, les policiers n'ont trouvé aucune photo du ministère des Finances à l'intérieur. L'homme a été laissé libre car aucune infraction n'a pu être retenue contre lui et que son titre de séjour était valide.",

    "text": "Topped with a shikhar style dome and bow and arrow peculiar to Lord Ram, the new railway station in Ayodhya, which is set to be inaugurated on Saturday, has all the trappings of a temple.\nIMAGE: A view of the redeveloped Ayodhya Railway Station ahead of the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple to be held on January 22, 2024. Photograph: ANI Photo Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to open the redeveloped Ayodhya Junction station during his visit to the holy city on Saturday.\n Ayodhya railway junction has been renamed as Ayodhya Dham junction, local MP Lallu Singh said on Wednesday.\nThe new building stands next to the old station building.\nAyodhya district has two main railway stations -- Ayodhya Junction located in Ayodhya City and Ayodhya Cantt (earlier Faizabad Junction) in Faizabad City.\nIMAGE: Finishing works in full-swing ahead of inauguration of the revamped Ayodhya railway station. Photograph: ANI Photo \"Earlier, many passengers were getting confused between the two stations. Now, they will know that Ayodhya Dham station means the one near the holy Ayodhya city, and not get it mixed with the station (Ayodhya Cantt) on the Faizabad city side. The old board is expected to be changed very soon,\" Ayodhya Junction's station superintendent Vijay Kumar Choubey told PTI .\nIn 2019, the Faizabad district was renamed Ayodhya district, which was followed by the rechristening of Faizabad Junction in 2021.\nThe redevelopment work on the station, which started a couple of years ago, has been executed by RITES, or Rail India Technical and Economic Service Limited, a central public sector undertaking under the ministry of railways, and one of the Navaratnas.\nPhotograph: ANI Photo A board that has been put up near the new structure describes the new station as an \"extension building\" of the existing railway station.\nPTI visited the newly built station earlier this week when leftover masonry, stone polishing, and paint works were still strewn about.\nA senior RITES official said the new station building comes equipped with many modern facilities that passengers usually get at an airport, but the architecture of its facade \"embraces tradition\" in a nod to the upcoming Ram temple.\n\"The building's frontage has a colonnade having a concrete core with a cladding of sandstone, and on its side ends are tall round pillars, again having a cladding of sandstone to lend it a traditional look,\" the person told PTI on the condition of anonymity.\nPhotograph: ANI Photo \"The top of the station has a structure with a design that resembles a royal mukut while a bow has been depicted on a wall just beneath it. This is to signify Ayodhya's association with Lord Ram,\" the official added.\nThe building, with three floors -- ground, mezzanine, and first -- and has a 'shikhar' on top of each of its two corners. A shikhar is an Indian-style dome peculiar to Hindu temples.\nThe station's frontage has two 'chhatri-style 'structures, one at each end.\nLamp posts installed in front of the new building of Ayodhya station are topped with a bow and arrow.\nRam Phal, a mason from Chhattisgarh, who has been working on the construction of the new building, on Tuesday pointed to these lamp posts while finishing his work ahead of the inauguration.\n\"This is Ramji's teer-dhanush on the lamp post. The entire station looks like a temple. I am happy that the Ram temple is being built in Ayodhya,\" he told PTI .\nHindus believe that Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Ram.\nAfter sunset, both the old and new buildings of the station were bathed in a dazzling pink.\nThe central hall of the station has a stone inlay work and its roof has a \"polycarbonate sheet\" that gives it a bluish hue on parts of its high ceiling.\n\"The new building is 144 m long including the round pillars span, and 44 m wide.\nIt is 11.7 m high, and is also a green building with a rain harvesting facility,\" the official said.\nThe consecration ceremony of the upcoming Ram temple in Ayodhya is slated to take place on January 22, and a massive crowd is expected to gather in the temple town.\nThe expansion of Ayodhya Railway Station is in line with the government's efforts to ease the movement of devotees coming to Ayodhya for darshan of the temple.\nHem Raj, a Rajasthan native and a teacher, who was visiting Ayodhya, said \"a larger station was needed.\"\n\"I keep coming here, either alone or with family for 'darshan' of Ram Lalla. It is wonderful that an old temple architecture has been used in its facade design,\" he told PTI .\nMohd Jafar Khan, a painter from Badaun, said he had been working at the new Ayodhya station for the last four years before the Covid-induced lockdown.\n\"It is going to be a very beautiful station,\" he said.",

As difficult as this is, I have sisters, friends and my own mom who are wonderful mothers, and I look forward to celebrating them on Mother’s Day. However, every year on Mother’s Day, I struggle. Strangers assume that I’m a mother, and family overcompensates for the fact I’m not one.

    "title": "The Triplex: One year on, a Berkshire County success story",
    "text": "Great Barrington — It has been over one year since The Triplex Cinema reopened its doors after a long ownership drama that was, in itself, worthy of a Hollywood movie plot.\nSouth Egremont resident Richard Stanley previously owned the theater for 28 years. In January 2023, New Jersey-based theater company Cinema Lab announced that it would buy The Triplex . In March 2023, however, it was revealed that the company did not have enough money to purchase the theater.\nStanley subsequently announced that the theater would shut down by June 2023 if it could not find a buyer.\nIn April 2023, several Berkshire County residents formed a grassroots group , Save the Triplex, to purchase the theater with plans to operate as a nonprofit organization. The leaders of the grassroots group and Cinema Lab then battled it out through statements and press releases arguing who had a better vision for the movie theater.\nIn the ensuing months, Save the Triplex raised $670,380 via a GoFundMe fundraiser , and over 800 individual donors supported the campaign to purchase the theater.\nIn July 2023, the grassroots group announced that it had raised enough money to purchase the theater from Stanley for $1 million. After five months of closure for renovations, the theater officially reopened on November 17, 2023 , under its new ownership as a nonprofit.\nSince its reopening, the theater has hosted movie discussions and special events. The Triplex was one of the hosts of the annual Berkshire International Film Festival , and it has also hosted events featuring Bill Murray , Griffin Dunne , and other figures from both Hollywood and the independent filmmaking world.\nThe motto of The Triplex, on display throughout the building, is “Movies For All.” “We settled on that motto because we are community supported, and we like to think of ourselves as a community hub,” Triplex Cinema Board President Nicki Wilson told The Berkshire Edge. “The Triplex had a longtime reputation before it closed as a place where you could come and see some art films, but at the same time, you could also see the latest blockbuster movies. We wanted to honor the history of this theater when we took it over.”\n“One of the many things that we all love about movies is that it is such an accessible art form,” said Triplex Creative Director Ben Elliott [ DISCLAIMER: Ben Elliott writes a weekly column for The Berkshire Edge titled “At The Triplex” ]. “We live in an amazing community filled with fantastic performance venues and museums. However, it sometimes feels like there are barriers to entry for some members of the community where they don’t feel like those spaces are for them. We want The Triplex to feel like a place for everyone in the community, and that means having programs that interest as many different parts of the community as possible.”\nWilson said that this includes having leaders of local organizations take part in film screenings. “For example, if we have a film about domestic abuse, we invite the leader of the Elizabeth Freeman Center to come down and speak about it,” Wilson said. “If we have a film about aging, we have a conversation afterward about aging. We’ve had many film discussion events, but the most exciting thing is that, afterward, everyone goes out into our lobby and continues the conversation.”\n“Community connections are a core part of our mission,” Elliott said. “Connection is an important part of the experience, and we want to not only preserve connections but also find ways to cultivate it. Movies are an accessible way to enter different worlds and get different viewpoints. It’s such a great way to live in other people’s experiences. Movies allow someone to step in someone else’s shoes for a little bit. When we have events and have people from the community come and talk about how they have just watched a movie, it’s an important part of cultivating connections.”\nBoth Wilson and Elliott said that the past year has not been without its struggles, especially considering that the movie industry is still rebounding from the pandemic. “The movie industry is still kind of figuring out what its future looks like,” Elliott said. “When the industry was still kind of coming back from the pandemic, that was right then the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Writers Guild of America strikes all hit. It’s been an inconsistent year because of the strikes.”\nElliott said that, despite the strikes putting a halt to Hollywood releases for some time, the industry has started to bounce back. “Recently, theaters had their best Thanksgiving weekend in box office history,” Elliott said. “Thanks to ‘Wicked’ and ‘Moana 2,’ we had a record attendance for that weekend. Things have been coming along well over the past few months.”\nBoth Elliott and Wilson said that they hope The Triplex will continue to thrive in 2025 and beyond through community support. “We are a community-run theater, and because of the community The Triplex continues to exist,” Wilson said. “However, it’s never ever a done deal. Movie theaters alone do not make money. We’re hoping that the community continues to financially support us in the way they have been this past year so we can continue to be there for them and meet the needs of the community.”\n“The economics of operating an independent movie theater [are] rough,” Elliott said. “We knew that coming into this, but this year has been even harder than usual. We have only made it through this year because of the support of the community, but we need continued support. When we opened, I think people were like, ‘Mission accomplished, Triplex saved.’ But it’s an ongoing process to continue to operate The Triplex, and we need the community’s support to help us get to where we want to go in the future.”\nFor more information about The Triplex, visit its website .",
