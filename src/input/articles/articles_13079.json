    "text": "Press release -\nFirst successful routine measurements of Sun’s magnetic field in the corona\nA team of scientists have successfully carried out regular measurements of the outermost layer of the Sun’s atmosphere for the first time – giving us a much better understanding of the magnetic field within this region, known as the solar corona.\nThe Sun’s magnetic field plays a key role in shaping its atmosphere, with activity such as solar eruptions and the heating of the corona to millions of degrees Celsius direct results of the evolution of solar magnetic field over different time scales.\nClose to the sun’s surface the magnetic field is strong, making it easier to measure, but in the corona the radiation is much weaker, meaning it has historically been difficult to monitor.\nFour years ago, researchers from Peking University, China; the National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA; and Northumbria University in the UK, made a breakthrough when they provided the first global measurements of the corona’s magnetic field through seismology, using observations from the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) instrument to determine how fast magnetic waves are moving through the Sun’s corona.\nSince then, they have continued their observations and have today published new research in the journal Science detailing the results of eight months of continuous measurements of the magnetic field in the Sun’s atmosphere using data from CoMP, which is based in Hawaii.\nBetween February and October 2022, the team produced 114 maps of the coronal magnetic field, achieving a measurement frequency of roughly once every two days.\nThey were able to measure the magnetic field strength at different altitudes within the corona over multiple solar rotations and identify discrepancies in the predicted magnetic field strength within high-latitude and active regions.\nNorthumbria University’s Dr Richard Morton has been involved in the research over the past four years. His area of work focuses on magnetic waves, also known as Alfvén waves, and their ability to transfer energy through a star’s atmosphere.\nSpeaking about this latest research he said: “How fast the Alfvén waves move depends on how strong the magnetic field is, so by tracking their movement we can build up a picture of the sun’s magnetic field at different distances from its surface.\n“We have been developing software to follow the movement of Alfvén waves and applying this to months’ worth of data from CoMP has given us a much clearer picture of how these waves behave in the corona and the impact they are having on solar activity.”\nThe coronal magnetic field is the main energy source for coronal heating and space weather effects. It can impact the Earth's space environment through solar wind and coronal mass ejections, posing potential threats to spacecrafts, communication system and other human activities.\nBy demonstrating the possibility of continuous and long-term measurements, Dr Morton and his research colleagues have opened new avenues for studying and predicting space weather in future.\nIn 2020 Dr Morton was awarded a prestigious UKRI Future Leader Fellowship for his research into Alfvén waves and over the last four years has led a team of academics from Northumbria, as well as the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Harvard Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in the United States, and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canaria in Spain as part of the Revealing the Pattern of Solar Alfvénic Waves (RiPSAW) project.\nHis Fellowship has now been extended for a further three years, during which he will analyse data from the National Science Foundation’s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) – a four-meter solar telescope on the island of Maui, Hawaii, and currently the largest solar telescope in the world.\nHe said: “I was delighted to be awarded time using the DKIST telescope – this is a new instrument and I’m looking forward to seeing how the data we gather can further improve our understanding of the corona by tracking the movement of Alfvén waves.”\nDr Morton joined Northumbria in 2012 as an Anniversary Research Fellow in the University’s Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering. In 2014 he was awarded a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship.\nHis contribution to the field of Solar Physics has been recognised with the award of the Royal Astronomical Society's Winton Capital prize in 2015 and Fowler Award in 2021.\nDr Morton is a member of Northumbria University’s world-class Solar & Space Physics peak of research excellence.\nThe paper, Observing the evolution of the Sun’s global coronal magnetic field over eight months, has been published in the journal Science.\nHeader image - an image showing the Sun’s disc blocked out by a coronagraph, having a similar effect as the moon during a solar eclipse.

    "text": "Cristina Yanez was filled with hope as she drove to Mexicali, Mexico, on a hot summer day to make her dream of having a family a reality — with the help of an [fertility treatments](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716#:~:text=During%20in%20vitro%20fertilization%2C%20mature,about%202%20to%203%20weeks.). Yanez and her husband, Alex, spent eight years trying to conceive a child, but they were always met with disappointment. After a series of tests were completed, they learned Alex had issues with his sperm. Cristina, a full-time registered nurse, looked into her medical plan and quickly realized that fertility treatments of any type would not be covered. HEALTHCARE NEWS: [Who’s Who in Arizona Healthcare for 2024](https://azbigmedia.com/business/health-care/whos-who-in-arizona-healthcare-for-2024/) RANKING ARIZONA: [Top 10 hospitals for 2023](https://azbigmedia.com/business/ranking-arizona-top-10-hospitals-for-2023/) And she learned that fertility treatment in the United States could cost anywhere from $20,000 to $40,000. “I was not about to go into debt not knowing that we were not going to be guaranteed a family or children, because it’s a scary journey,” she said. Fertility treatments in Mexico In 2019, a family member told Cristina about a clinic in Mexicali called Dr. Cigüeña, which means “doctor stork.” Yuma, where the couple lives, is about an hour’s drive from Mexicali, and the Dr. Cigüeña clinic there is walking distance from the U.S.-Mexico border. Cristina’s parents were born in Mexico, and crossing the border was routine for her. And she never felt skeptical about exploring fertility treatment options in Mexicali because she was ready to have a baby. “I was just ready to start. After waiting for so many years I was not hesitant at all,” she said. “My husband, on the other hand, was very skeptical. He was almost pessimistic about the whole thing and the whole procedure.” After so many negative pregnancy tests, he had lost all hope, he felt the procedure would likely fail and they would lose the money they put down, Cristina said. But she kept praying. She scheduled a consultation with Dr. Francisco Javier Estrada Garwood, the director at Dr. Cigüeña. The low cost of the consultation – less than $50 – surprised her. During her visit, Cristina saw other women who were coming to Dr. Cigüeña for the same reasons she had made the drive – for a chance to have a family. “I was able to witness other couples who were going there that were from different cultures: American, white, African Americans that were also there and they were getting services,” she said, noting how the staff “cared for the patients that are having these issues and problems.” After her consultation, Estrada Garwood told Cristina her best chance at having a family would be in vitro fertilization. IVF consists of collecting mature eggs from the ovaries, then fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory and returning them to the uterus as embryos. While millions of Americans travel to other countries every year for health care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautions that people [should be careful](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) with medical tourism and do their research. But Cristina, who spent years working as a recovery nurse, said she relied on her medical expertise and asked Estrada Garwood detailed questions about medication and her care. “He had really good bedside manners. He knew about his medication. I asked him about the medication, and he was very educated on it,” she said. “So I knew at that point he knows what he’s doing.” Cristina was told the procedure, which on average needs about three rounds before it is successful, each round would cost anywhere from $4,000 to $6,000 depending on her medication needs – a fraction of what it would cost in the U.S. When Cristina heard the price of fertility treatments in Mexico, she felt it was “almost too good to be true.” Even though she considered this her last option, she wasn’t about to give up hope. “I was telling myself, ‘This is going to work, this is going to work, and we’re going to be more than blessed,’” she said. One round of IVF costs around $23,474 in the U.S., according to [FertilityIQ data](https://www.fertilityiq.com/topics/ivf/the-cost-of-ivf-by-city). But a 2007 [article in the Journal of Health Economics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762960600124X?via%3Dihub) said that, “Nationwide, only 25% of health care plans cover fertility treatment, and coverage varies significantly by state.” Due to the high out-of-pocket costs needed to cover the treatment, the article said, fertility treatments are often only affordable for a certain demographic: women and couples who are white, college-educated and affluent. For Cristina and Alex, getting the procedure done in the U.S. was not an option financially. But that doesn’t mean care in Mexicali was without drawbacks. Each visit took Cristina about six hours driving back and forth from Yuma to Mexicali to prepare her body for the procedure, which can take up to several weeks. At times she felt lonely making the drive by herself because Alex wasn’t always able to go.. “Every other day I’m going back and forth to the clinic. And every day I give myself injections, usually at night in my stomach,” she said. “It’s very stressful because the male just provides his sample and then the rest is the woman’s part … It’s not easy.” Cristina began fertility treatments in Mexico in July 2019. Her embryo transfer was completed by Estrada Garwood on Aug. 27. Even then, Cristina said Alex felt it was unlikely the procedure would work. But by Sept. 11, a little over two months into the treatment, Cristina had a positive pregnancy test. “I cried. I hadn’t seen a positive pregnancy test ever,” she said. “I felt happy that whole day, just kind of like it was unreal almost, but still happy.” She prepared a gift box for Alex’s upcoming birthday, with her positive pregnancy test, her injection syringes and baby socks in the box. She said Alex cried tears of happiness when he opened the box. One week later, Cristina and Alex learned she was pregnant with twins. “We got lucky and that one embryo split into twins without us knowing or trying anything different. It’s just what happened at the hands of God,” she said. Estrada Garwood has practiced reproductive medicine for 15 years. With most of Baja California’s fertility clinics in Tijuana, more than two hours away, he saw the need for a clinic in Mexicali. Dr. Cigüeña opened in 2014, one of several fertility clinics in the border city. “One in six couples has fertility problems. It is something super common, this happens all over the world, everywhere…. We have to help the people of this whole area,” Estrada Garwood said, referring to the border region of both countries. He said couples come to his clinic from all over the United States, some from as far away as Georgia and Washington, but most from Arizona and California. The Mexicali clinic serves approximately 1,000 families and couples a year, and about 40% of his patients are American, he said. The treatment’s cost can vary within the U.S.. “In Arizona it is twice as expensive as here (in Mexicali). California is three times or even four times more expensive,” Estrada Garwood said. About 70% of the women who come to see him are 35 and older, which is when fertility rates decline. Estrada Garwood said infertility “has always existed,” but his practice continues to grow because women’s roles in society have changed. “Today women are no longer like our grandmothers, who got pregnant at 16 or 18 years old or our mothers who started to get pregnant at 23 or 24,” he said. “Now women start to get pregnant at 28 or 30. The new generations are already thinking about getting pregnant at 33 or 34 so they can achieve economic or professional stability or some kind of postgraduate degree.” A [U.S. Census Bureau analysis](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/fertility-rates-declined-for-younger-women-increased-for-older-women.html?utm_campaign=20220406msacos1ccstors&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!ddcmkFE8epQZisVdZu1r5VK6MwnRydMEhPbeaiXi-i93Mq1_49aAXHmUBwdzhF-S87kofMIy_DtwR1UYUUA$) of National Center for Health Statistics data between 1990 and 2019 found that while fertility rates fell for women between ages 20 and 29, “they increased by more than 67% for women between 35 and 39, and by more than 132% for women between 40 and 44.” Estrada Garwood said American patients tell him they have to visit multiple providers and clinics when they are seen by U.S. providers. He said he tries to set his clinic apart from American clinics with the attentive care they provide patients. Estrada Garwood said and his staff, who are bilingual in Spanish and English, have to fight the misperception that Mexico is an unsafe place to visit or get treatment, which he blames on the media’s portrayal of Mexico. “Our facilities are first-class. All our personnel work with precision and are trained both here in Mexico and abroad,” he said. “We are highly committed people to our patients in helping them achieve a baby.” Cristna gave birth to healthy twin boys in April 2020. The total cost of her care and treatment was around $6,000. She was so pleased with the care she received that she went back to Dr. Cigüeña a second time. “I felt very comfortable and almost more confident in what I was doing and what was happening. I felt no doubts about anything at all,” she said of her second time. She gave birth to her third son in December 2022. “They did miracles for us. Our first set of twins was a miracle,” she said. Today, Cristina finds joy in being the mother of three young boys. As a nurse, she sees the pitfalls of the health care system every day. “I feel like health care should be more accessible and affordable. Although we have the Affordable Care Act, it’s not affordable and working in health care I see so many patients struggle. Medicine is so expensive,” she said. “You go across the border and it’s a quarter of the price,” Cristina said. “I feel like we should be able to offer that here in the United States. Why? Why should people go to other countries to get their medicine or travel distances for their medicine?”",

    "title": "N. Korea launches major crackdown on Chinese phones along border - Daily NK English",
    "text": "North Korean authorities have initiated a major crackdown on Chinese phone users in North Hamgyong province, deploying state security teams to Hoeryong to enforce the ban. The campaign appears aimed at stemming the flow of information across the Chinese border, where people have used Chinese phones to communicate with the outside world.\nHoeryong, a city on the border with China, is home to many people who use Chinese phones for business, either arranging imports or handling remittances from defectors in South Korea for commission.\nThe dozen or so enforcers sent by North Hamgyong province’s state security bureau will augment the state security agents already monitoring phone signals in Hoeryong to create a team of nearly 30 people who are policing the use of Chinese phones in the area.\nThe enforcers operate phone signal detectors at various times and locations to hunt down people using Chinese phones.\nWhile dispatching the extra enforcement team, the provincial state security bureau stressed that the project’s goal is to eradicate the practice of delivering money from outside the country to people on the inside.\nThe North Korean authorities have outlawed the delivery of remittances from South Korea and China and consider that an act of espionage.\nThe arrival of the enforcement team from the provincial state security bureau is a source of anxiety for Chinese nationals in North Korea with Chinese bank accounts who earn commission on remittances.\nThe provincial state security bureau also declared that anybody who receives illegal funds from overseas or who engages in related activities will not be able to avoid legal consequences and that state security agents who fail to find offenders will be held accountable.\nThis last threat has galvanized state security agents to become even more vigilant in their hunt for users of Chinese phones.\nPolice join crackdown, sparking fear among border residents\nIn connection with that, Daily NK recently reported that the Hoeryong police department had ordered officers to intensify their search for users of Chinese phones, while offering the incentive of special promotions for police officers with high numbers of arrests.\n“Not only state security officers but also police officers are beating the bushes to catch Chinese phone users. With so many state security agents on the case, people are very nervous they won’t be able to avoid detection,” the source said.\n“In the past, there were certain spots where police officers and state security officers would use the phone signal detector, so all phone users needed to do was avoid those spots. But now, enforcers carry around portable phone signal detectors, so you never know when you might be caught.”\nThe regime’s large-scale crackdown on the use of Chinese phones is grim news for many North Koreans who fear their livelihood is in jeopardy.\n“People who use Chinese mobile phones and facilitate remittances from overseas aren’t selling out their country — they’re just trying to make a living. Many people struggle to come to terms with why the government is making things so hard for them,” the source said.\nNorth Hamgyong province’s state security bureau plans to continue its crackdown against Chinese phones with the help of the extra enforcement team through the end of the year.\nDaily NK works with a network of sources in North Korea, China, and elsewhere. For security reasons, their identities remain anonymous.\nPlease send any comments or questions about this article to dailynkenglish@uni-media.net.",
