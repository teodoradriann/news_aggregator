    "title": "Harris was wildly insensitive to protesters at Michigan rally",
    "text": "'I'm speaking': Harris response to pro-Palestinian protesters shows she's not open to criticism Although Democrats are divided on Israel-Palestine, many want to support the Harris-Walz ticket. Brushing off protestors makes that hard. Two weeks ago, I wrote about [the dangers of idolizing Kamala Harris](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/07/25/kamala-harris-campaign-biden-support-criticism-censorship/74518606007/) and dismissing her critics following her bid for president. Harris is not a perfect presidential candidate. This is a truth many knew but were avoiding in the excitement of the new Democratic ticket. The honeymoon is over. At Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s, joint rally in Michigan on Wednesday, a group of pro-Palestine protesters began chanting “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide, we won’t vote for genocide,” while Harris spoke about freedoms Americans would lose under another Trump presidency. She [snapped at the protesters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/07/harris-to-protesters-if-you-want-donald-trump-to-win-then-say-that/74714086007/), conflating their demonstration with wanting Trump to win the election. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that otherwise, I'm speaking,” she told them. This response lacks critical thinking and is also wildly insensitive while having a rally in Michigan of all places, the state with the largest Arab American population by density. Democrats are divided on Israel-Palestine Michiganders and other pro-Palestine Democrats genuinely want to support Harris’s presidential campaign. Members of Michigan’s uncommitted movement, a grassroots effort, encouraged voters to withhold support for Biden during the primary election in February due to the Administration's policies on Israel and Palestine. The group held a press conference the same day as the Harris-Walz rally, and is asking for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. The uncommitted movement is withholding an endorsement for Harris until they learn more about her position. Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the movement and a Democratic National Convention delegate [told the Detroit News](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/08/07/uncommitted-leaders-demand-kamala-harris-back-israel-weapons-embargo-to-get-presidential-endorsement/74699770007/), “I want to be there, right there with my fellow Democrats, with the energy as we're getting exciting updates about the president's vice presidential pick.\" But Alwaeih and others cannot do that if they know their vote will result in further atrocities in Gaza. That’s not an unreasonable ask. Beyond what is happening overseas, many have rightful concerns over the influence Israel, a foreign government, has over United States politics. On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, who has been openly critical of Israel, lost in the primary to her opponent Wesley Bell. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group, [boasted their contribution to the loss](https://x.com/AIPAC/status/1821291980724556193) on X. AIPAC has been spending millions to push Bush and other critics of Israel out of Congress in order to replace them with pro-Israel Democrats, according to [reporting from The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/israel-house-election-cori-bush-aipac/). AIPAC’s influence over the United States government cannot be understated, with 194 members of the House and 22 members of the Senate receiving donations during the 2024 cycle according to [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/american-israel-public-affairs-cmte/recipients?id=D000046963), a nonprofit that tracks campaign finances and lobbying. President Biden [has been lauded](https://www.aipac.org/resources/president-biden-strengthens-us-israel-relationship-on-first-presidential-middle-east-trip) by AIPAC for his commitment to U.S.-Israeli relations. Harris must be receptive to criticism to win the election I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Harris needs to be receptive to criticism if she wishes to differentiate herself from the Biden administration and strengthen her chances of winning this election. Imprudently, she has yet to provide a solid policy agenda and mostly positioned herself as an alternative to Trump. Compromise and understanding can only serve to help her campaign. The Harris-Walz ticket is balancing on a very delicate unity that left-leaning and moderate Democrats have formed over the last few weeks. Every move from Harris and Walz is precarious and should be handled with the utmost care. Popping off at the mouth at pro-Palestine protesters in Michigan? Not the smartest move. There are inherent flaws to single-issue voting, and a lot is a lot at stake with this election − reproductive rights, health care and protections for transgender youth just to name just a few − but this is a red line I will never fault one for making. As we inch closer to election, she will find that it is an issue she will increasingly not be able to brush off like she did at Wednesday’s rally. If Harris continues this lack of willingness to take criticism it could be her downfall, and I would sincerely like to avoid that possibility.

    "text": "Il Liverpool completa il sorpasso in\ntesta alla Premier League dopo la sconfitta dell'Arsenal,\nbattuto 2-0 all'Emirates Stadium dal West Ham nell'ultima\npartita 19/a giornata di campionato. La squadra di Juergen Klopp\nmartedì aveva battuto il Burnley salendo a 42 punti, sorpassando\ni Gunners (40) e l'Aston Villa (39). Il Manchester City, che\nperò ha una partita in meno, è a quota 37. Nell'altro incontro\nodierno, il Brighton ha sconfitto 4-2 il Tottenham, che resta\nquinto con 36 punti, mentre la squadra di Roberto De Zerbi si\nporta all'ottavo posto.\nCinque giorni dopo aver paregggiato 1-1 col Liverpool ad Anfield Road, l'Arsenal si è piegato alla squadra che già li aveva eliminati dalla Coppa di Lega e che si conferma una delle migliori del momento, con tre vittorie consecutive. Il West Ham ha segnato nel primo tempo col ceco Soucek e raddoppiato nella ripresa grazie al greco Mavropanos, sprecando poi il rigore del possibile 3-0 con Benrahma, ma ormai si nel recupero. Il successo porta gli Hammers al sesto posto, in vista della zona Europa e con solo tre punti di ritardo dal Tottenham.\nGli Spurs hanno perso male sul campo del Brighton, subendo troppo le iniziative degli avversari, in gol già all'11/o con Hinshelwood su assist di Joao Pedro, il quale ha poi trasformato due rigori prima e dopo la rete del 3-0 siglata da Estupinan.\nVeliz e Davies hanno ridotto lo svantaggio, troppo tardi però per mettere in dubbio la vittoria dei Seagulls.\nRiproduzione riservata © Copyright ANSA",

    "text": "Reuters\nFILE PHOTO: The Deepseek app is seen in this illustration taken on January 29, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\nSHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese technology startups are racing for fresh fundraising to capitalise on the DeepSeek-induced fervor towards artificial intelligence, as well as President Xi Jinping's recent show of support to the country's private enterprises.\nAI-powered optics startup Rid Vision, brain-computer interface company AI CARE Medical and robot-maker Shanghai Qingbao Engine Robotics are among Chinese tech start-ups seeking fresh onshore financing, venture capitalist Andrew Qian said.\n\"Many people are knocking at the doors of these AI companies, half discussing business cooperation, the other half talking about investment,\" said Qian, the CEO of New Access Capital, which has invested in the three firms.\n\"You can see from the DeepSeek case, that a batch of Chinese innovators with disruptive technologies is emerging... Previously, Chinese start-ups were nearly all 'me too'\", Qian said, referring to copycats.\nThe flurry of roadshows and deal announcements by AI-related businesses - including chipmakers, cloud service providers and AI apps - has breathed new life into the country's moribund venture capital sector.\nThe outlook for exits from investments by venture capital and private equity firms, however, remains clouded by a stringent regulatory vetting of IPOs at home, and heightened Sino-U.S. geopolitical tensions that threaten offshore listings.\nIn the near-term, however, DeepSeek's AI breakthrough and this month's rare meeting between President Xi and tech business leaders have boosted investor sentiment.\nNew Access Capital has recently invested in a chip startup and a maker of millimeter wave antenna, and is planning to invest in a company focused on rocket recovery technologies, betting on the next DeepSeek in these fields, Qian said.\nCompanies that are seen as benefiting from China's AI advancement are the main focus of the latest round of investments.\nAI image generation platform LibLib AI, for example, announced several hundred million yuan in a new funding round on Monday at what the company called a \"record-breaking pace of financing\".\nAI-powered medical startup SenseCare said last week it had raised 100 million yuan, while chipmakers Aspiring and Hyseim also announced fresh fundraising recently.\nBLEAK PICTURE\nOther startups that have tapped investors in recent days include AI Infrastructure provider Siliconflow, robot-maker Ruichi Smart Technology and medtech startup Neurodome, according to consultancy Zero2IPO.\nThe pickup in venture capital investment interest comes after bleak performance over the last few years - China venture fundraising and investments have fallen off the cliff since a 2021 peak, Preqin data showed.\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nIn 2024, 67 funds raised $12.5 billion, a far cry from 2021's $141 billion. Dollar-denominated funds raised a meagre $1 billion last year, the data showed. Venture deals totalled $229 billion last year, down 36% year-on-year and just over a quarter of 2021's $816 billion.\nThe industry, which relies mainly on IPOs to exit from their investments, suffered from China's introduction of stringent IPO rules, and Sino-U.S. tensions that had hampered offshore listings by Chinese companies.\nSince the launch of DeepSeek's breakthrough AI model, \"the sentiment has improved a lot,\" said Huo Zhongyan, founder of Bonanza Capital, which has invested in an AI-powered garment designing and marketing startup.\n\"People get more sanguine about China's future ... Stock bullishness made entrepreneurs more confident, and investors more willing to place bets.\"\nMorgan Stanley said on Tuesday that it sees signals of normalising IPOs in the A-share market.\nBut Huo doubts Chinese regulators will loosen IPO criteria any time soon, also cautioning that offshore listings, which have shown signs of recovery, are vulnerable to geopolitical winds and fluid market mood.\n(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Kane Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Lincoln Feast.)\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters .",
