    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "(The Center Square) - Supporters of several citizen initiatives, some already adopted into Washington law, and others to appear on the November ballot are not buying Attorney General Bob Ferguson's transparency claims following last week’s surprise ruling from the State Supreme Court.\nThe ruling went in the favor of initiative supporters, but the surprising part came in the fact those supporters had no idea there was a legal challenge.\nBrian Heywood with Let’s Go Washington, the group behind the initiatives, and supporters held a protest rally Wednesday in front of the Seattle office of the attorney general, demanding to know why they were not notified of legal challenges that could have invalidated every single one of the initiatives.\nThe State Supreme Court ultimately ruled against the plaintiffs bringing the litigation, which was centered on challenging the process of certifying the signatures and seeking an injunction to remove the initiatives from the November ballot as Secretary of State Steve Hobbs’ office reconfirms the signatures came from legal voters.\nFerguson successfully defended Hobbs and the initiatives, and secured a unanimous ruling from the Washington Supreme Court, but Heywood and others who support the measures argue they should have known the challenges even existed.\n“We didn’t even know about it until two hours before the ruling,” said Heywood. “There was absolutely no media coverage which means they weren’t aware of it.”\nPete Serrano, a candidate for WA Attorney General, and an attorney with the Silent Majority Foundation which has defended I-2081 -the parents bill of rights measure-tells The Center Square Ferguson’s office had a responsibility to inform the involved parties.\n\"Why didn't we know?\" said Serrano.\nHe also suggests the fact Ferguson’s campaigns have been funded by the very people behind the legal challenges presented a conflict of interest, or at least the appearance of one.\n“He should have done one of two things,” said Serrano. “He could have said these plaintiffs are the people who’ve funded my campaigns and I’ve made public statements against these initiatives, so I’m putting on the record and if anyone wants to raise a challenge, so be it,” said Serrano.\n“Or he should have just flat out recused himself,” he said. “When you’re not transparent and you’re doing things that appear to stink of conflict of interest, it’s not good for the public appetite for the process.”\nFerguson’s office maintains the AG’s office and its nonpartisan attorneys represented the people of Washington in defending their right to vote on the initiatives.\n“Our legal victory achieved the precise outcome these partisans say they wanted in the case that they’re upset about,” said spokesperson Brionna Aho in an email to The Center Square.\nAs to the claim the AG’s office kept the case a secret, Aho said that's \"absurd.\"\n“We provided multiple briefings to the Legislature about this case since February; we briefed senior legislative staff of both parties, including staff for the House Republicans and Senate Republicans,” said Aho’s email.\nThe Center Square reached out to Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, who is the ranking Republican in the Senate.\n“I don’t have any details, understanding or knowledge of these supposed briefings,” said Braun. “But even so, briefing legislative staff does not ensure all are aware of the litigation and in particular this litigation does not involve the legislature.”\nBraun said there are strict rules about those types of conversations in the legislature.\n“Staff would have significant restrictions on providing information to Rep. Walsh or other legislators because that’s not allowed,” said Braun.\nHe was referring to Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, who chairs the state Republican party and sponsored the initiatives. Walsh said he was never informed of the legal challenges.\nBraun said Ferguson may not have legally been required to recuse himself in the case but says it would have been the right thing to do.\n“He gets caught keeping secrets or being non-transparent and he wants to blame everybody else instead of just taking responsibility and saying we could have done better,” said Braun. “I think if he had a clear desire to stay above the fray, that would have been the appropriate thing to do.”",

Cet appel intervient alors que les négociations salariales ont débuté dans les entreprises et ne sont \"pas au niveau\" des revendications de l'intersyndicale.\nDans le secteur des industries électriques et gazières, dont EDF et Enedis, les augmentations générales sont décidées au niveau de la branche et s'appliquent dans l'ensemble des entreprises, qui négocient ensuite une enveloppe d'augmentations individuelles, l'addition des deux donnant l'augmentation globale des salariés. \"En augmentation générale, on est à +0,8% (...). En entreprises, l'ensemble des quatre organisations syndicales représentatives de la branche ont demandé 2,3% en mesures individuelles\", a déclaré à l'AFP Laurent Koessler, chargé du dialogue social à la CFE-Energies. Or, \"les négociations en entreprises ont commencé et on n'est pas à ce niveau\", a-t-il ajouté.\nUne réunion prévue le 5 décembre\n\"A la suite de la séance d'ouverture de la négociation sur les mesures salariales 2025, la première proposition de la direction d'EDF est un faible taux de 1,5%\", a précisé l'intersyndicale dans un tract. Elle demande à la direction de \"revenir en négociation en proposant bien plus pour répondre aux 2,3% revendiqués sur les mesures individuelles\".\nPour les mêmes raisons, l'intersyndicale appelle à faire grève \"chez EDF, chez Enedis et sur l'ensemble des entreprises du secteur électrique et gazier, donc il n'y a pas une seule entreprise qui échappe au préavis de grève\", a ajouté Laurent Koessler, une information confirmée par la CGT d'EDF et la CGT de GRDF. La date du 5 décembre correspond à une réunion prévue de l'organe de branche de l'énergie pour négocier d'autres sujets.\nCommentaires\nConnectez-vous à votre compte franceinfo pour participer à la conversation.",

    "title": "Australian severe storms declared insurance catastrophe as claims soar",
    "text": "Insurance claims filed after the severe thunderstorms, convective weather and hail that struck eastern parts of Australia over the Christmas period, resulting in flooding and property damage, have soared and with more extreme weather events anticipated, the Insurance Council has designated the events an insurance catastrophe. We reported earlier this week that the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) has declared a “significant event” for the severe weather that had affected the eastern side of Australia. Parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria were particularly badly hit and as of December 27th more than 7,500 claims related to the storms had been received across the three states. Now though, with severe weather having continued and more in the forecast for the eastern states of Australia, the Insurance Council said it has “escalated its response to severe storms impacting Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria since 23 December, declaring an Insurance Catastrophe.” As of this morning, the number of claims filed with insurers has risen significantly to 18,174 claims related to the storms across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, 10,716 of which are from the Gold Coast region alone, the ICA explained. ICA COO Kylie Macfarlane, commented, “Given the immense scale and destructive nature of these storms across eastern Australia, the Insurance Council and insurers are escalating our response to a Catastrophe level to better serve the immediate and future needs of our customers. “Insurers expect claims volumes to grow in the coming days as more residents gain access to properties and power is restored to some areas, however, it is too early to understand the cost of the damage.” Property and auto damage is reported to have been significant and with flooding yet to subside in some areas, while more severe weather is forecast with large hail possible, it seems the claims burden is likely to keep rising and this could become a costly event for the Australian major insurers. It’s impossible to say whether the industry loss from these storms could reach levels where reinsurance support is called on. But the generally higher reinsurance attachment points, as well as reduced use of aggregate reinsurance, should help to ensure more of these storm losses stays with the major primary insurers of Australia, than might have been the case just a few years ago.

    "text": "This morning’s Gospel reading is Mark 14:12–16, 22–26:\n On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?” He sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city and a man will meet you, carrying a jar of water. Follow him. Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.” The disciples then went off, entered the city, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.\nWhile they were eating, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, gave it to them, and said, “Take it; this is my body.” Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it. He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed for many. Amen, I say to you, I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.” Then, after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\nAdvertisement Family vacations in my youth nearly always meant going on the road. A couple of times, we rented a motor home, but most often we just piled into the family sedan and drove. Dad never did much care for stopping along the way, except for basic sanitary needs, so we'd pack food -- mainly snacks for the car, but full stocking of the kitchen the motor home. Mom was mindful to keep the choices as healthy as possible, but kids being kids and whining being whining, we got some of our choices, too.\nI'm not sure how successful that strategy was. I recall a few moments of she's touching me! and he crossed over onto my side and If you two don't stop we'll just turn around and go home, and maybe more than just a few at that. In retrospect, the destinations were fun, but the driving is more what I recall. In some ways, the driving and the preparation seem more formative than the destinations were -- the anticipation for each new point on the adventure, the planning, and the time together while traveling.\nOn today's Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ, we have elements of all these in mind: the journey, the destination, and the food that sustains us along the way. I had an opportunity to put that perspective into reality a year ago. Our local parishes came together to do a Eucharistic procession through Waco, on a very hot and sunny day, which I wrote about at the time and the local paper covered . (If you look closely, you can even see me briefly a couple of times, sweating profusely under a dark leather hat.)\nAdvertisement In last year's reflection, I recognized the importance of both the journey and the destination, and what sustained us on the way:\n I learned a few things about processing in summer and about our community. For one thing, I learned that singing while stationary and singing while walking are two very different things. It was also well over 90 degrees outside when this procession took place — a dry heat, but still a factor. And yet no one I saw was complaining or even had a sour look on their face. Choir members may have been concentrating on their sheet music, but everyone else seemed to share my sense of joy in rallying behind the Eucharist and making their faith known to the community. The people we did see as spectators seemed to be supportive and interested in the event.\nWhen we reached the destination church, which was slightly larger than the originating church, I noticed something else as well. It appeared that everyone had journeyed, one way or the other, to completion. The church was filled to standing-room-only for the Eucharistic adoration, and just as enthusiastically engaging as before.\nThis was in every sense a pilgrimage , if on a small scale, and reflects our primary pilgrimage to the Lord. Our first reading today speaks of a pilgrim people and their journey, too. In Exodus 24, Moses speaks to the people the Lord has called out of Egypt and binds them to the Lord with their oath. At the start of their journey to the Promised Land, the twelve tribes of Israel offer sacrifices at an altar Moses builds at the foot of the mountain. Moses splashes the blood on the altar and sprinkles it on the people, signifying the renewal of the covenant the Lord made with Abraham.\nAdvertisement Unfortunately, the same people balk almost immediately and demand to go their own way. In Exodus 32, they build a golden calf as an idol while Moses communes with the Lord, even though God has provided them with bread in the form of manna (Exodus 16) for their journey to the Promised Land, as well as His salvation from the enemies of the Israelites along the way.\nThus it is with us to this day. We balk at the Lord's commandments, and partake of that which pollutes us rather than sustains us. Even on the pilgrimage and desiring the Lord's mercy and salvation, we demand to have it on our own terms, and gripe endlessly about the Lord's bountiful provisions. We spend too much time worrying about what others have rather than the blessings we have received ourselves. And we worship what we create rather than worship Him who made all things.\nIn the Eucharist, we receive all we truly need for our long pilgrimage to the Lord, and with it the restored worship of our Creator rather than our worldly appetites. When we come together to receive it and give thanks for it, we find that we are all walking along the same path, even if we started from very different places. The joy that brings can help us overcome the struggles and obstacles on that path, and keep us walking in the One Way to Christ.\n Today we are called to recognize those blessings, and to solemnly give thanks in communion with Christ and each other. Jesus instituted the Eucharist, the combination of manna and the blood covenant of salvation, as food for our journey. He broke His body and shed His blood for our sake, not His, so that we could be sustained on our pilgrimage.\nAdvertisement Come walk with the Lord, for He is good ... and He is with us, sustaining us on our pilgrimage, today and until the end of the age.\nPrevious reflections on these readings:\nCome to the feast: Sunday reflection Sunday reflection: Mark 14:12–16, 22–26 The front page image is \"The Institution of the Eucharist\" by Ercole de' Roberti, c. 1490.

    "title": "A novel combination of CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibitors exhibits highly synergistic activity and translational potential in Ewing sarcoma.",
    "text": "Abstract\nEwing sarcoma is a highly aggressive solid malignancy affecting children and young adults. Ewing sarcoma is driven primarily by EWSR1::FLI1, a fusion oncoprotein that has been notoriously difficult to target with traditional pharmacologic agents. There are numerous examples of preclinical promising combinations of small molecules that are never tested in pediatric clinical trials because agents fail to reach the market due to limited efficacy for common adult cancers. Moreover, the effectiveness of single-agent therapies for cancer treatment is often limited. To address these limitations, we selected 28 compounds that were largely FDA approved or in late stages of clinical development and known to regulate important pathways in Ewing sarcoma. We performed a drug screen in Ewing sarcoma cell lines with 180 combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, and conventional chemotherapy. The results of the screen revealed that a PI3K inhibitor, copanlisib, combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib, exhibited strong synergistic anti-Ewing sarcoma activity. Using proteomic methods such as a reverse-phase protein array and western immunoblotting, we demonstrated that this combination induced a downregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. We further confirmed these in vitro data using bulk RNA-sequencing. To evaluate the phenotypic effect of the PI3K/CDK4/6 inhibition in Ewing sarcoma lines, we performed apoptosis and cell cycle analyses using flow cytometry and demonstrated that ribociclib primarily induced a G0/G1 arrest with minimal effect on Ewing cell viability but significantly enhanced the apoptotic effect of copanlisib treatment. In a xenograft model of Ewing sarcoma, we demonstrated that the combination therapy significantly prolonged survival compared to treatment with either vehicle or single-agent therapy alone. Our findings identify a new candidate therapy combination for Ewing sarcoma using FDA-approved drugs and provide a resource of additional potential synergistic combinations for future validation.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nSGD reports consulting fees from Amgen, Bayer, InhibRx, and Jazz and travel expenses from Loxo, Genentech, and Salarius.

Join [YEN's Sports News channel](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VamN2ruAu3aJIhBTan3o) on WhatsApp now! Boeing workers in the Seattle region overwhelmingly voted to strike Thursday, spurning a contract the embattled aviation giant characterized as a boon for manufacturing staff given the company's stressed financial condition. Hourly workers rejected the contract with a vote of 94.6 percent and to strike with 96 percent, said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751. \"Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,\" said Holden, who represents about 33,000 workers in the Pacific Northwest. \"We strike at midnight.\" A strike will shutter two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and sideline some 33,000 workers. Thursday's vote marks a decisive rejection of a deal that line workers said was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives, marking the latest show of defiance by unions following earlier strikes in the auto, [entertainment](https://yen.com.gh/entertainment/) and other industries. Led by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had hoped a 25-percent wage hike over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would avert a costly strike as the company struggles to right the ship. PAY ATTENTION: [All celebrity news in one place! Follow YEN's Facebook Broadcast channel and read on the go.](https://m.me/j/AbZDnCBguSItn6tf/) Ortberg argued in a message to staff that the general wage hike marked the largest in history and that a strike \"would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.\" But rank-and-file workers reacted with fury to the agreement, which was initially backed by IAM leadership. 'Hollow' commitments Workers had sought a 40 percent wage hike and critics have said the 25 percent figure is inflated because the new deal also eliminates an annual company bonus. Other points of contention include the deal's failure to restore a pension, as well as a Boeing pledge to build its next plane in the Seattle region, which critics view as a \"hollow\" commitment to the region because it offers no promises beyond the four-year contract. \"They're talking about a 25 percent increase and it's not,\" said Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett who voted to strike after concluding Boeing's spin was \"misleading.\" Janousek, 55, who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, figures his raise is only about nine percent after Boeing dropped the annual bonus. Some workers also expressed anger about Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, two former CEOs who received multi-million dollar compensation even as the company faced turmoil upon their departure. \"Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well being,\" said Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic who has been at Boeing for six months. Philbin said he will work side [jobs](https://yen.com.gh/tags/jobs/) if a strike drags out, but that he and his wife have been holding off on having kids until the situation stabilizes. \"(Boeing) is a huge company, they can survive paying the [people](https://yen.com.gh/people/) who do the work a little more,\" he said. Big impact from strike? The IAM has a history of striking, with the most recent stoppage in 2008 lasting 57 days. Holden has said he initially backed the deal as the best that could be achieved without striking. But the \"real power\" in the union resides with the workers, according to Holden who said at a press conference that \"awesome\" wins by other unions had given the IAM \"something to aspire to achieve as well.\" Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the AeroDynamic Advisory consultancy, said a lengthy strike would damage Boeing's turnaround prospects, but noted that a 2023 strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems lasted less than two weeks. Boeing has been under renewed scrutiny since a January incident in which a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing. Holden said he looked forward to getting back to the bargaining table. Thursday's vote \"sends a strong message that our members deserve better,\" he said.

    "title": "Bangkok Post - Help the homeless",
    "text": "Buaphan, a mentally unstable vagrant, was found dead on Jan 12.Police initially arrested her husband, Panya, before the CCTV footage obtained by a Channel 8 TV team helped unmask the real murderers. Confronted with the evidence, the teenagers eventually admitted to assaulting and killing the 48-year-old before dumping her body in a pond.The public initially focused on the police's mishandling of the case, especially the torturing of Buaphan's husband to force him to confess to a crime he had not committed, as well as loopholes in criminal juvenile law.However, little attention was paid to the vulnerability of homeless people like this all over the country, not to mention those who are also suffering from mental problems. Yet, this is a social time bomb that has been off the radar for far too long.On any given day, members of the public may encounter at least one homeless or mentally unbalanced person without having any idea how to help or what to do with them.The network of non-governmental organisations working with homeless people correctly pointed out there is a stigma that dehumanises homeless and mentally unstable people, meaning they could be subject to various kinds of violence, from verbal abuse to physical assaults by gangsters or individuals, as in the case of Buaphan.This stigma makes many people indifferent to their plight rather than lending a hand. And it's safe to say there are probably many cases of violence against these groups that go unreported.Data released last year by the Social Development and Human Security Ministry shows that Bangkok has the largest number of homeless, or 1,271, followed by Chon Buri (126), Chiang Mai (118), Khon Kaen (73), and Kanchanaburi (62). Of course, the real number must be higher.Yet, the ministry has no active plan to tackle the problem, such as finding them shelter or securing welfare or rehabilitation for them. More seems to be getting done by NGOs like the Mirror Foundation and a network comprising various groups under the banner \"Friends of the Homeless\".The Mirror Foundation, in particular, has gained recognition for its initiative connecting some vagrants, who may need re-skilling, to job markets, as well as its \"People on the Street\" programme, which helps secure assistance for those living on the pavement or at bus stops.It's among the first agencies to raise public awareness about the need to help homeless people with mental problems.As an NGO, the foundation depends on public donations for its operations, which may be one of its biggest constraints.The ministry, with all the resources at its disposal, should review its work so as to fill the gap regarding the assistance given to this vulnerable group.At least, it should help support the work of volunteers like those at the Mirror Foundation and others, if not form an alliance with them and other state agencies.Moreover, it's important that all assistance must be given on one condition: No strings attached.",

    "title": "Los mejores destinos de esquí en Estados Unidos: guía completa para los amantes de la nieve",
    "text": "Hacer esquí y practicar snowboard en icónicas montañas y paisajes imperdibles sin necesidad de gastar una alta suma de dinero es posible en Estados Unidos. En 37 de los 50 estados de este país los turistas amantes de la nieve pueden realizar varias actividades, por lo que se ha convertido en un destino ideal para todos, desde los más novatos hasta los más expertos en este deportes.\nPara quienes buscan opciones más asequibles hay áreas de esquí más pequeñas y exclusivas como Boone, Carolina del Norte, o Canaan Valley, Virginia Occidental. Estas son perfectas para los más pequeños o principiantes en los deportes de nieve, desde el esquí alpino y snowboard, hasta el esquí de fondo (nórdico), raquetas de nieve, tubing, patinaje sobre hielo y motonieve.\nMadre colombiana vivió una pesadilla en el aeropuerto de Cancún: “Ver a mis hijos con hambre fue devastador”\nSi bien hay personas que optan por tomar sus vacaciones en una playa paradisiaca, sin duda hay muchas otras que deciden arriesgarse a realizar un viaje extraordinario y lleno de aventura. Esta es una guía completa de los mejores destinos de esquí, realizada con información de Brand USA, la organización de marketing de destinos en Estados Unidos, para que los turistas sepan dónde hospedarse y cuál es el ideal para cada ocasión.\nColorado y Utah, los destinos más conocidos\nColorado es el destino de esquí más conocido de Estados Unidos, famoso por su nieve perfecta y con textura similar a la del polvo, bastante sol y cielos despejados. ¿Dónde alojarse? Eso es lo mejor. En Colorado los turistas pueden encontrar más de 24 resorts de esquí, incluidos cuatro de los más altos del mundo: Breckenridge, Loveland, Telluride y Aspen, todos por encima de los 3.800 metros y ubicados en las Montañas Rocosas.\nLea también: Este país con paradisiacas playas y templos eliminará la visa para colombianos: ¿qué se necesita para viajar?\nMuchos resorts tienen servicio de transporte desde el aeropuerto de Denver y hay vuelos disponibles directamente desde varias ciudades de Estados Unidos a los aeropuertos regionales de Colorado. Por ejemplo, la aerolínea Eagle cuenta con vuelos a Vail Mountain, y Hayden/Yampa Valley ofrece vuelos a Steamboat Springs. Otra opción es un tren de Amtrak, que opera de Denver a Winter Park Resort hasta el 31 de marzo.\nPor otro lado, Utah, conocida como The Greatest Snow on Earth” (La Mejor Nieve del Mundo), cuenta con 15 resorts de esquí, 10 de los cuales están a una hora en carro del aeropuerto de Salt Lake City, donde se puede alquilar un vehículo o tomar un bus con destino a las pistas.\nPara hospedarse, los turistas pueden ir al centro de Salt Lake City, donde existen varias opciones como para visitar un resort diferente cada día. Entre estas se encuentran Park City, el resort de esquí más grande de Estados Unidos y sede de los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de 2002, y Sundance, el resort rústico fundado por el actor Robert Redford, donde se celebra el Festival de Cine de Sundance cada enero.\n“Ya sea que los viajeros practiquen esquí bajo cielos soleados en las Montañas Rocosas de Colorado, o se dirijan a Utah, donde pueden llegar desde aeropuerto a las laderas en una hora, Estados Unidos alberga algunos de los mejores destinos de esquí del mundo”, comentó Fred Dixon, presidente y director ejecutivo de Brand USA.\nLe puede interesar: Desafiar lo tradicional: las predicciones de viajes para el 2025\nAñadió que hay otros lugares icónicos como Lake Placid, Nueva York, “que ha sido sede de los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno en dos ocasiones; encantadores pueblos de esquí en Nueva Inglaterra, como Stowe, Vermont, y destinos únicos como Taos, Nuevo México, conocido por su terreno desafiante y su comunidad artística y multicultural”.\nOtros lugares imperdibles\nFuera de Colorado y Utah hay varios resorts en otros estados del Oeste de Estados Unidos, y también suelen estar entre los mejores destinos de esquí del país. Entre ellos se encuentran Grand Targhee y Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Schweitzer y Sun Valley en Idaho; Big Sky y Whitefish Mountain en Montana; Angel Fire y Taos en Nuevo México; Mammoth y Palisades Tahoe en California; y Heavenly en la frontera entre California y Nevada. Otros resorts reconocidos son: Arizona Snowbowl, que está a tres horas en carro desde el aeropuerto de Phoenix, y Mount Bachelor en Oregón.\nVarios de estos destinos del Oeste, como Sun Valley y Whitefish, son conocidos por su auténtico ambiente local y una atmósfera amigable y relajada. Otros, como Taos y Jackson Hole, son muy apreciados por los esquiadores expertos debido a su terreno desafiante. Mammoth y Big Sky están entre los más destacados por su escena de apres-ski y fiestas, mientras que los destinos aptos para toda la familia incluyen Mount Bachelor y Angel Fire.\nEntretanto, el esquí en Nueva Inglaterra no consiste solo en deslizarse por una montaña. También se trata de visitar acogedoras cabañas, pintorescos pueblos, históricos puentes cubiertos y graneros rojos al borde del camino. Fuera de las pistas, se puede observar el proceso para fabricar el jarabe de arce, aprender a jugar al cribbage (un tradicional juego de cartas) o contratar un guía para pescar en un estanque congelado.\nVermont es uno de los destinos preferidos de los viajeros ya que cuenta con 25 resorts incríbles, incluidos Killington, Stowe, Sugarbush, Okemo y Stratton. Varios resorts están ubicados a tres o cuatro horas en carro desde Boston, y también se puede viajar en avión directamente a Burlington, Vermont, desde algunas ciudades de Estados Unidos. También hay servicio de bus y el tren de Amtrak desde Nueva York y Boston.\nEste lugar es ideal porque, además, se encuentra el famoso Vermont Country Store, el encantador pueblo de Woodstock.\nPor otro lado, Nuevo Hampshire alberga 18 áreas de esquí alpino, incluida la estación de esquí Cannon Mountain, donde creció el medallista olímpico Bode Miller, y el histórico Bretton Woods, el resort más grande del estado con 63 pistas.\nLea aquí también: Fort Lauderdale, una ciudad cuyo encanto navega más allá del mar\nEn Maine, los viajeros pueden dirigirse a Portland y ubicar el Saddleback o Sunday River. Sugarloaf, en Maine, la mayor área de esquí al este de las Montañas Rocosas, es el único lugar en la región que ofrece esquí sobre la línea que trazan los árboles.\nHacer esquí en la conocida “capital del mundo” también es posible. El estado de Nueva York tiene más de 50 áreas de esquí, que van desde Hunter Mountain y Belleayre Mountain, a unas tres horas en carro desde la ciudad de Nueva York, y perfectas para familias y principiantes, hasta Whiteface Mountain, conocida por su caída vertical de 1.045 metros y su terreno desafiante, que incluye las pistas Black Diamond y Double Black Diamond. Cerca de Whiteface, los visitantes pueden experimentar la historia olímpica en el pintoresco pueblo de Lake Placid, que fue sede de los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de 1932 y 1980.\nClases y guías privadas para esquiar\nEn las mejores montañas de Estados Unidos, además de dejarse encantar por sus hermosos paisajes, los viajeros pueden tomar clases y guías privadas para esquiar.\nLa mayoría de los resorts en Estados Unidos ofrecen clases para todas las edades y niveles de habilidad, comenzando por las “colinas para principiantes”, destinadas para niños y novatos.\nLas clases pueden comenzar a partir de los 3 o 4 años, pero muchos resorts también ofrecen cuidado infantil y actividades de “juego en la nieve” para los huéspedes más pequeños. Algunos lugares, como Telluride en Colorado, cuentan con instructores multilingües. Otros, como Park City en Utah, ofrecen esquí adaptado para personas con discapacidades.\nMientras que los esquiadores avanzados que buscan una aventura más desafiante pueden considerar contratar un guía para aventuras en el campo o incluso heli-esquí (donde helicópteros los transportan a la cima de una montaña) en lugares como las Montañas Chugach de Alaska, hogar del Alyeska Resort.\nY para los más expertos, hay zonas exclusivas que cuentan con tres resorts donde no está permitida la práctica de snowboard: Mad River Glen en Vermont, y Alta y Deer Valley en Utah.\nEsquí, una actividad que no solo se puede realizar en invierno\nEl esquí en Estados Unidos no es solo una actividad invernal: muchos resorts permanecen abiertos hasta mediados o finales de abril. En primavera los visitantes pueden dirigirse a laderas menos concurridas con tiempos de espera más cortos, precios más bajos, temperaturas más suaves y más horas de luz. Algunos resorts finalizan la temporada en abril con festivales, fiestas y otros eventos divertidos. Una tradición de finales de primavera es el “pond-skimming”, en la que esquiadores disfrazados bajan por una pendiente y luego intentan deslizarse sobre un estanque sin caer.\nAlojamientos desde 32 dólares por noche\nLo mejor de estos destinos es que hay alojamientos realmente asequibles. Hay hostales con tarifas de USD $32 por noche hasta hoteles de lujo cinco estrellas como The Little Nell en Aspen, Colorado. También hay una variedad de hoteles, encantadoras posadas rurales, Airbnbs y otros alquileres de condominios, casas y apartamentos, junto con chalets y opciones de acceso directo a las pistas.\nMuchas cabañas cuentan con acogedoras chimeneas y sillas cómodas, en las que los huéspedes se pueden ubicar después de un largo día al aire libre y relajarse con una taza de chocolate caliente o chili, un guiso típico de invierno.\nSi los visitantes buscan más diversión, las opciones de apres-ski y actividades fuera de las pistas incluyen spas, tiendas y restaurantes, clubes nocturnos, bares y música en vivo, paseos en trineo tirados por caballos y paseos en trineo de perros. Para quienes disfrutan de los juegos, los viajeros pueden considerar el resort Heavenly en la frontera entre California y Nevada, ubicado cerca de los casinos en South Lake Tahoe y Stateline, Nevada.",
