    "text": "Los comisionados electorales de los distintos partidos políticos reaccionaron hoy con frustración tras darse a conocer una nueva denuncia de fraude electoral en Jayuya, a solo 12 días de las elecciones generales.\nY es que una ciudadana acudió a las redes sociales para indicar que alguien acudió a solicitar sin autorización el voto adelantado a nombre de su tía, una mujer encamada y con múltiples condiciones que limitan su habla y movilidad.\nLa licenciada Karla Angleró, comisionada electoral del Partido Popular Democrático (PPD), expresó que este caso \"lo que nos reafirma es un patrón del Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP) de acudir a estas égidas o casas de alojamiento donde la población es vulnerable para cometer estos actos que se constituye delito, sea en la esfera estatal como federal y delito grave. Así que urgimos a las autoridades concernientes a que investiguen de manera inmediata, de manera que puedan ejercer las acciones que correspondan = contra estos individuos\".\nSegún se destaca en la publicación en redes sociales, la electora tiene las manos rígidas por lo que aun no se explican como se dio la alegada solicitud para voto adelantado. Asimismo Angleró destacó que el coaccionar y mentir bajo juramento en este aspecto es un delito tanto estatal como federal, por lo que instó al comisionado electoral que llevó esa solicitud a la junta de inscripción permanente a que dé explicaciones.\nOtros comisionados electorales se unieron al llamado a que las autoridades estatales y federales se unan a esta pesquisa, a la vez que reconocieron que no es el primer caso de esta índole que se denuncia en este ciclo electoral.\nLos funcionarios instaron a personas que tienen familiares en centros de cuido prolongado a que se mantengan pendientes para que no se aprovechen de ellos.\nContenido relacionado:\nLa comisionada electoral del PPD también ofrece detalles sobre problemas que han surgido con las máquinas de escrutinio electoral.\nLas hijas de la mujer añadieron que la mujer jamás pidió el voto adelantado pero aún así aparece como que firmó y envió papeletas.",

Nonetheless, some will pretend that Lebanon and Gaza are the same fight and refuse to see what Hezbollah really is. [/vc_column_text][vc_separator sep_color=”” uncode_shortcode_id=”179367″][vc_column_text uncode_shortcode_id=”436386″] For anyone skeptical that the nearly year-long daily exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah was an actual war, all doubts were erased over the past ten days. The new phase that began with exploding Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies was followed by Israeli airstrikes across southern Lebanon on the group’s weapons depots and top leaders and hundreds of Hezbollah rockets shot deeper into northern Israel than during the previous 11 months. The increased pace and scope of exchanges have raised fears of an escalatory spiral that will end with an Israeli ground invasion and possibly a wider regional war, and there are legitimate fears that Israel is on the verge of embroiling itself in a second front without a clear strategy or exit plan, replicating the seemingly perpetual cycle it is going through in Gaza.\nThe comparison to Gaza makes sense on some levels. Israel is proceeding with the theory that it must first escalate with Hezbollah in order to de-escalate, similar to the theory it has utilized in Gaza that escalating military pressure will eventually force Hamas into capitulation by seeking a ceasefire on Israel’s terms. It has conducted a stunningly effective aerial campaign over the past week and a half but left unclear is what comes next or what the underlying strategy is to translate its military success into realizing its objective of allowing 60,000 displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. This too is reminiscent of where Israel finds itself after 11 months of fighting in Gaza, having demonstrated clear military superiority but without any demonstrable plan to turn it into a strategic victory.\n“Israel is proceeding with the theory that it must first escalate with Hezbollah in order to de-escalate, similar to the theory it has utilized in Gaza that escalating military pressure will eventually force Hamas into capitulation by seeking a ceasefire on Israel’s terms.”\n[/vc_column_text][vc_single_image media=”100635″ caption=”yes” media_width_percent=”100″ uncode_shortcode_id=”476123″][vc_column_text uncode_shortcode_id=”989089″] Nevertheless, the fight against Hezbollah should not be viewed as a similar but larger version of Israel’s fight against Hamas. While the theory about escalation eventually forcing Hezbollah capitulation may appear to be repeating a tactic that has not yet proven true in Gaza, Hezbollah’s situation is distinctive. Unlike Hamas, which exists to futilely attempt to resist Israel out of existence, Hezbollah has a specific purpose, which is to serve as an Iranian deterrent mechanism against a large-scale Israeli military campaign against Iran. Hezbollah’s guided missile arsenal is Iran’s core interest since it is viewed as the equivalent of second-strike capability that can target Israeli cities and infrastructure. This counterintuitively gives Israel more room to operate against Hezbollah rocket stores and even top commanders since Iran wants to preserve the heavy missiles. While Israel’s latest moves have upped the escalatory factor in a real way, Hezbollah may not be in a position to risk its most important weapons by responding in a way that draws an even greater Israeli response.\n“Hezbollah has a specific purpose, which is to serve as an Iranian deterrent mechanism against a large-scale Israeli military campaign against Iran. Hezbollah’s guided missile arsenal is Iran’s core interest since it is viewed as the equivalent of second-strike capability that can target Israeli cities and infrastructure.”\nHezbollah also operates in a trickier political environment than Hamas. Unlike Hamas, which was the unitary power in Gaza before October 7, Hezbollah is the most powerful actor in Lebanon but it is not the only one. Lebanon is fragmented in a way that Gaza was not, which means that even Hezbollah has some political restraints that Hamas did not. Complicating things further, Hezbollah is a Shia militia and political party that also operates as an Iranian proxy in a state that is only about 30% Shia and where large segments of the population resent Iranian domination and interference. There is a genuine debate about the level of support for Hamas among Gazan Palestinians, but Hamas reflects significant popular will in terms of its general attitude—if not tactics—of resistance to Israel. Hezbollah is far more sectarian, far more controversial, and far less popular due to the perception that it has led Lebanon to state and economic collapse. All of this gives Israel more leeway to operate against Hezbollah with less blowback than it has in Gaza. The IDF has so far made the most of that leeway, and so far the cost to the Israeli homefront—whether because Hezbollah is in disarray or because it is biding its time—has been much less than feared. [/vc_column_text][vc_single_image media=”100636″ caption=”yes” media_width_percent=”100″ uncode_shortcode_id=”100208″][vc_column_text uncode_shortcode_id=”536969″] Despite this, there remain warning signs ahead. No matter how thoroughly the IDF dismantles Hezbollah’s capabilities, it will not eliminate the group’s capabilities entirely—including with a ground operation—and that means that absent a plan to translate the military operation into a diplomatic offramp, tens of thousands of Israelis cannot go back to their homes since there will still be intermittent rockets and drones. The biggest looming concern is that Iran’s response to the degrading of its most valuable proxy will not come via other proxies or Iranian conventional weapons, but on the nuclear front. If Iran believes that its only reliable deterrent against Israel has been eliminated, it may rush to establish a more permanent deterrent in the form of nuclear breakout. This leaves Israel with a difficult balancing act: needing to eliminate the Hezbollah threat without doing so in a way that will lead to an actually existential threat. Even with these considerations though, the last ten days should provide Israeli decision-makers with a level of optimism that has been in short supply since October.\n“If Iran believes that its only reliable deterrent against Israel has been eliminated, it may rush to establish a more permanent deterrent in the form of nuclear breakout. This leaves Israel with a difficult balancing act: needing to eliminate the Hezbollah threat without doing so in a way that will lead to an actually existential threat.”\nOf course, there is one reliable place where Israel is still fighting a losing battle. To listen to international commentators across television airwaves and journalists in various mediums, the last ten days are a shocking example of disproportionate and barely provoked Israeli aggression. Despite Hezbollah firing rockets at northern Israeli communities starting on October 8, there remains a fiction in some quarters of Hezbollah restraint. Despite countless videos of secondary explosions from Hezbollah weapons stores literally going on for minutes following Israeli strikes on allegedly civilian structures, there remains a narrative that the IDF is indiscriminately blowing up anything it sees in southern Lebanon. Despite the fact that Hezbollah has been designated as a terrorist entity by the U.S., the U.K., and Germany and has killed hundreds of American soldiers, there remains a clueless interpretation of Hezbollah as nothing more than a legitimate Lebanese political actor. Despite the fact that Hezbollah made the conscious decision to attack northern Israel with rockets, drones, and anti-tank missiles in solidarity with Hamas one day after the October 7 attacks and has not let up for a moment, there remains a fatuous insistence that Israel is the aggressive party with expansionist designs on Lebanon. [/vc_column_text][vc_single_image media=”100637″ caption=”yes” media_width_percent=”100″ uncode_shortcode_id=”164734″][vc_column_text uncode_shortcode_id=”112254″] And this is where the comparison to Gaza breaks down most thoroughly. Nothing can ever justify Hamas’ October 7 massacres, rapes, and abductions, but they rest in the larger context of battles over nationalism, legitimacy, and territory that define the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hezbollah has nothing to do with this, no matter what it or its defenders claim. Israel is not occupying Lebanon. It does not control the lives of millions of stateless Lebanese. Any rationale for Hezbollah’s resistance against Israel disappeared the day Israel withdrew from its security zone in southern Lebanon a quarter century ago. Even taking the most sympathetic possible view toward Hezbollah of the situation does not justify anything it has done since October 7, or make its attempt to don the mantle of defender of Palestine any more coherent. Those who take at face value Hezbollah’s linkage of October 7 and Gaza with its own military assault on northern Israel should think hard about how and why this makes any sense at all. The intellectually honest move would be to drop the pretense that Lebanon has anything at all to do with Gaza, and to admit that the real problem some have is Israel using force to defend itself in any guise and against any foe.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

(EUROPA PRESS) -\nLas fuerzas de seguridad de Turquía han detenido este viernes a más de 30 personas supuestamente vinculadas con el grupo yihadista Estado Islámico que planeaban atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en el país, así como contra la Embajada de Irak en la capital, Ankara.\nFuentes de seguridad citadas por la agencia estatal turca de noticias, Anatolia, han indicado que entre los detenidos figura Mikbel al Shuaili, alias 'Abú Yakin al Iraqi', considerado como un miembro de la rama de Inteligencia del grupo yihadista en Turquía.\nAsimismo, entre los detenidos figuran Muhamed Hilaf Ibrahim Ibrahim, alias 'Abú Leis', sospechoso de planear los ataques contra sinagogas e iglesias, e Iheb Elani, alias 'Abdulá al Jumeili', quien presuntamente preparaba un atentado contra la Embajada iraquí.\nEstas fuentes han destacado que otras 29 personas que mantendrían contactos con los tres principales sospechosos también han sido detenidas en la operación, llevada a cabo por los servicios de Inteligencia y la Dirección General de Seguridad.\nPor su parte, el ministro del Interior turco, Ali Yerlikaya, ha destacado en un mensaje en su cuenta en la red social X que \"la lucha contra las organizaciones terroristas y sus colaboradores continuará con determinación\".\nYerlikaya ha destacado que la operación ha tenido como objetivo el 'Batallón Selman-i Farisi', parte de la estructura de Estado Islámico en Turquía, y ha confirmado que estas personas \"habían identificado y llevado a cabo trabajos de reconocimiento sobre lugares de culto judíos y cristianos en Estambul\".\n\"Felicito a los miembros de los servicios de Inteligencia y la Policía que han llevado a cabo las operaciones\", ha dicho. \"Por la paz, unidad y solidaridad de nuestra nación, no toleraremos a los terroristas. Continuaremos nuestra lucha sin interrupción con los grandes esfuerzos de nuestras fuerzas de seguridad\", ha apostillado.\nLa operación ha tenido lugar una semana después de que el propio Yerlikaya anunciada la detención de más de 300 personas por sus presuntos lazos con el grupo yihadista Estado Islámico en una serie de operaciones llevadas a cabo en más de 30 provincias del país, en el marco de los esfuerzos contra las actividades de la organización terrorista.\nLas autoridades turcas han llevado a cabo decenas de operaciones contra el grupo durante los últimos años. Estado islámico ha perpetrado varios atentados en suelo turco en los últimos años en los que han muerto al menos 300 personas y cientos más han resultado heridas.\nMás información Turquía Irak Terrorismo Daesh",

    "text": "Taxa de desemprego cai para 7,5%, a menor desde fevereiro de 2015 Publicado em 29/12/2023 - 16:00 Por Tâmara Freira - da Rádio Nacional - Rio de Janeiro O Brasil bateu um novo recorde de pessoas ocupadas: 100,5 milhões no trimestre encerrado em novembro, um crescimento de mais de 850 mil na comparação com agosto. Já a taxa de desemprego ficou em 7,5%, a menor desde fevereiro de 2015. E considerando apenas os trimestres encerrados em novembro, é a mais baixa desde 2014. A queda de 0,2 ponto percentual na comparação com o trimestre anterior foi a terceira consecutiva. Os dados são foram divulgados nesta sexta-feira (29) pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (Ibge). A coordenadora de Pesquisas por Amostra de Domicílios do Ibge, Adriana Beringuy, explica que neste período do ano, é comum que a ocupação aumente, ainda assim houve avanço na comparação com o ano passado. O Ibge identificou ainda que a maior parte dos trabalhadores que começaram uma ocupação neste trimestres foi com carteira assinada: 515 mil. Com isso, o emprego formal no setor privado aumentou 1,4%, totalizando 37,7 milhões de trabalhadores, segundo maior patamar da série histórica. Mas os empregados sem carteira também chegaram ao maior patamar da história, mais de 13 milhões de pessoas. Com isso, a taxa de informalidade do país ficou em 39,2% da população ocupada, um ligeiro aumento de 0,1 ponto percentual na comparação com os três meses anteriores. Adriana explica que há diferença de acordo com as atividades analisadas. Uma boa notícia é que a proporção de trabalhadores desalentados - aqueles que desistiram de encontrar trabalho - caiu 5,5%. Mas apesar de esse ser o menor contingente desde agosto de 2016, ainda havia quase 3,5 milhões de pessoas nessa situação no país. Outro dado positivo foi o aumento do rendimento médio real, que chegou a R$ 3.034 mensais. Edição: Rádio Nacional/Pollyane Marques",

More info\nJoin us on WhatsApp Holyhead Port in Wales will remain closed for another week following damage caused by Storm Darragh last weekend.\nThe port has been shut for a repair and clean-up job since December 7 and all ferry services between Dublin Port and Holyhead suspended. Fears are growing that Christmas deliveries may be delayed due to the disruption.\nThe port will not reopen until Thursday, December 19 at the earliest, it has now been confirmed that.\nA spokesperson for Holyhead Port told Dublin Live : \"Last Saturday morning (7th Dec) during Storm Darragh, an incident occurred at Holyhead Port which caused damage to port infrastructure.\n\"As a result, the ferry berths have remained closed to all marine traffic. No injuries were reported, and all relevant authorities were informed of the incident. Safety is of paramount importance to Holyhead Port and a thorough investigation into the extent of the damage and repairs required is ongoing. At this point, it is estimated that the berths will reopen for ferry traffic on Thursday 19th December at the earliest.\"\nHowever, An Post has moved to quell fears that presents and other goods may not arrive in time for Christmas Day, promising to be ready for the parcels from Holyhead when they arrive in Ireland. It also said hauliers had been diverting to other routes such as Rosslare Europort in a bid to avoid the logjam at Holyhead.\n\"We&apos;ll be ready for the Holyhead parcels when they arrive over the weekend – so we can get them through and out on delivery ASAP,\" said a spokesperson for An Post.\n\"We invested €6 million in expanding our parcel tech and capacity in Portlaoise and Athlone hubs this year, and we have 1,400 Christmas casuals helping to process and deliver parcels and letters too,\" they added.\nAn Post have advised customers not to wait until the last minute to post cards and parcels this Christmas.\n\"There will be nationwide parcel deliveries this week and post offices will be open all day on Saturday,\" said the spokesperson. We&apos;re seeing huge volumes of Christmas cards being posted in the last few days, particularly to family and friends abroad. The latest date for guaranteed parcel delivery across Europe is today (Thursday, December 12), and next Tuesday for cards.\"\nWednesday, December 18 is the latest posting date to ensure that parcels and cards are delivered to all parts of England, Scotland and Wales in time for Christmas. An Post added that they will be delivering up to Christmas Eve all parcels received by December 21.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
