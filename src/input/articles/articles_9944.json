En entrevista con Azucena Uresti, Ángel dio a conocer que creen que probablemente la muerte de su hermana Claudia Andrea podría estar relacionada con Miguel \"N\". El joven explicó que Claudia también era química y conoció a Miguel \"N\" hace muchos años en uno de sus trabajos y que tiempo después se reecontró con él en el hospital en el que laboraba. Incluso, expresó que el señor estuvo en el cumpleaños de ella y que probablemente sostuvieron una relación. \"En el cumpleaños de mi hermana él estuvo y al parecer estaban saliendo de octubre a diciembre de 2019\", explicó el joven. ¿Qué pasó con Claudia Andrea? De acuerdo con Ángel, Claudia vivía con su mamá, su hija y una roomie en un domicilio de la alcaldía Azcapotzalco en la Ciudad de México. No obstante, debido a que en esa fecha eran fiestas decembrinas se habían ido al estado de Morelos para festejar con su familia. El 27 de diciembre Claudia regresó a la CDMX y acudió directamente a trabajar. Aunque la joven le marcó a su mamá cuando llegó al hospital en el que laboraba ya no volvió a hacerlo. Por ende la madre preocupada le llamó a alrededor de las 10:00 horas de la noche y su hija le respondió que al día siguiente le marcaba porque se sentía mal. A partir de ese momento, la joven dejó de contestarle a su familia hasta que el día 30 de diciembre decidieron ir a buscarla. En este sentido, Ángel entró al domicilio, lugar en el que se dio cuenta de que su hermana estaba sin vida. Pese a que en ese momento las autoridades aseguraron que se trató de una muerte natural, el joven encontró varias inconsistencias en la habitación de ella e incluso no hallaron su celular. A esto se le suma que se dieron cuenta que tras la muerte de Claudia se hicieron retiros con su tarjeta. Ahora, años después de lo ocurrido, la familia de Claudia Andrea acudirá con las autoridades capitalinas con el objetivo de saber si existe una relación entre Miguel \"N\" y la muerte de la joven.",

Domingo/Senate PRIB\nCOTABATO CITY—Almost 300 former Moro rebels took their oath as members of the Philippine National Police on Thursday but Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Chief Minister Ahod “Al Haj Murad” Ebrahim is hoping that more will join the national government’s law enforcement force.\n“As one of the byproducts of the Bangsamoro peace process, we look forward to seeing members of the MILF (Moro Islamic Liberation Front) and MNLF (Moro National Liberation Front) as part of the uniformed personnel,” Ebrahim said in a message read for him by BARMM Deputy Senior Minister Abdullah Cusain during the oathtaking of 294 former Moro guerrillas as new members of the PNP.\nADVERTISEMENT The program was held on Thursday at Camp Salipada K. Pendatun, the BARMM regional police headquarters, in Parang, Maguindanao del Norte.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Malacañang declares Jan 2 (Tuesday) is not a holiday NEWSINFO Woman dies after vehicle crashes into QC bank NEWSINFO LTO: ‘No Registration, No Travel’ rule’s strict enforcement back in 2024 “This ceremony is indicative that the peace process that we have all worked so hard on is working and is forging a new path [for] peace, progress and development in the Bangsamoro and in the entire county,” Ebrahim added.\nThe recruitment of qualified former rebels into the police force for the region is among the key confidence-building measures outlined in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) which was signed by the government and the MILF in 2014.\n“The oath that you took today as full-fledged members of the armed national police force of the country serves as a pledge of commitment and a symbol of your dedication to the common good, and to serve and protect every Bangsamoro and Filipino,” the BARMM chief said.\nEbrahim urged the former Moro rebels to “exemplify the very best of duty, service, honor and justice.”\nScreening process The new police officers are part of the first batch of former guerrillas taken into the PNP to fulfill the quota for 2023.Speaking during the program, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos said the administration of President Marcos was committed to the Bangsamoro peace process, as indicated by the continued implementation of the government’s commitment to the CAB.\n‘Combatants to peacekeepers’ Abalos, who chairs the National Police Commission, assured the public that the new police officers were recruited through a transparent screening process, and underwent the same stringent procedures as the others who entered the police force.\nADVERTISEMENT “No one can claim there was favoritism, that some paid their way in. We made sure that it was fair. All of you reached this far through your merits,” Abalos said.\nHe urged the new policemen to remain strong amid the challenges that they would undergo as they train and prepare for deployment in the BARMM.\n“You will be training physically (and) mentally to become instruments of peace. Undeniably, you will face challenges, hardships and struggles. At the end of this road, there is triumph,” Abalos said.\nPresidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr. said that Thursday’s ceremony shows the transformation of Moro guerrillas “from combatants to peacekeepers.”\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The Sudanese Armed Forces have reportedly captured two bridges connecting Khartoum, on the east bank of the Nile, to Omdurman on the west, and are pushing toward the presidential palace amid heavy fighting.\nWhat’s the outlook? Sudan’s military counts on air superiority and artillery, but the RSF’s infantry has historically outmatched them. The RSF also enjoys considerable backing from the United Arab Emirates — a significant military power — as well as Libyan warlord Khalifa Belqasim Omar Haftar and the Russian mercenaries formerly known as the Wagner Group.\nSudan’s armed forces can count on less outside backing: Russia’s involvement has led to a limited deployment of Ukrainian special forces, and Iran has provided some drones (which, ironically, Tehran also provides Russia to fight against Ukraine). Even if they do manage to push the RSF out of Khartoum, Sudan’s military faces steep odds for regaining the whole country.\nIs there a chance for peace? Only through negotiation, according to Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of Sudan’s military. He called for the end to hostilities and a holistic peace process when he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York Thursday. However, his speech was hardly an olive branch: He accused the RSF of genocide for their slaughter of Black ethnic groups in Darfur province and even alleged that women and children had been sold as chattel in RSF-controlled markets.\nWe’re watching for who wins the fight in Khartoum, and whether the result of the battle might bring relief closer for the long-suffering Sudanese population.",
