    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Adams County, Pennsylvania from 1901-2000 was 31.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Adams County, Pennsylvania experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Adams County, Pennsylvania history.",

    "title": "Flovent inhaler: Doctors warn about asthma inhaler switch coming in January and the impact to insurance - ABC7 New York",
    "text": "Manufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent. Starting January 1, a drug that thousands of patients depend on to help them breathe will disappear from pharmacy shelves, and doctors are concerned patients may have delays switching to alternatives and getting them covered by insurance. Manufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent, and instead is making an \"authorized generic\" version, which is identical but without the same branding. Physicians who treat patients with asthma say the authorized generic will work just as well as the branded drug, but it doesn't appear to be covered as widely by insurers. That may mean patients will have to obtain new prescriptions and sort out coverage hurdles at the height of respiratory virus season. \"This medication has been the most commonly used inhaled medication for the past 25 or 30 years,\" said Dr. Robyn Cohen, a pediatric pulmonologist at Boston Medical Center. \"It's the one that, overwhelmingly, pediatricians reach for when they decide that their patient needs a daily preventive medication. ... The fact that it's being discontinued is going to be a huge shock to the system for patients, for families and for doctors.\" Doctors are urging patients to take action now to ensure they've got their medicine heading into the new year and advocacy groups have been trying to get the word out. But the story of why Flovent is disappearing, and the lack of insurance coverage for its ostensibly identical replacement, touches on some of the most complex facets of American health care and drug pricing. A spokeswoman for GSK said the company is making the change \"as part of our commitment to be ambitious for patients.\" She noted the company introduced the authorized generics of Flovent HFA, an inhalation aerosol, and Flovent Diskus, an inhalation powder, in May 2022 and October 2023, and that, subsequently, it would discontinue manufacturing the branded versions in the United States on January 1, 2024. The authorized generics, she said, \"will provide patients in the US with potentially lower cost alternatives of these medically important products.\" Experts who follow the industry both on Wall Street and in academia, though, point out GSK is making the switch at precisely the time a change in Medicaid rebates could cause the company to have to pay large penalties because of price increases on Flovent over a number of years. The legal change coming into effect on the first of the year removes a cap on Medicaid rebates that companies are required to pay if they raise the price of medicines more than inflation. \"Flovent Diskus has been on the market since 2000 and Flovent HFA since 2004, and GSK has hiked the price on both products numerous times since their launch,\" Dr. William Feldman, an associate physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital who studies asthma drugs, told CNN. \"These are precisely the sort of drugs that will be affected by the new policy eliminating the Medicaid rebate cap.\" Until now, the rebates were capped at the total price of a drug, so manufacturers would never pay more than a drug costs back to Medicaid. But under a provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, that limit was removed, and starting January 1, 2024, drugs that have been subject to large price increases over time could end up incurring rebates to Medicaid that are greater than their price - meaning pharmaceutical companies would sell those drugs to Medicaid at a loss. \"Obviously pharma doesn't want to be selling at a loss on anything in its portfolio,\" said Andrew Baum, an analyst who covers the stock of GSK and other pharmaceutical companies for the financial firm Citi. \"So it seeks to evade impact by, one: discontinuation; two: authorized generic.\" An authorized generic, Baum told CNN, is viewed as a separate product, \"but still enables pharma to collect some of the economics.\" Or, put another way, it's the same product without the branding and also without the history of price increases that would leave the medicine vulnerable to such large rebates to Medicaid. According to data from GoodRx, the price of branded Flovent has gone up about 47% since 2014. Other drugmakers have made changes ahead of the January 1 rebate cap removal as well; makers of insulin this year announced major price cuts - of 70% or more - on their products, a move analysts estimate will save them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The authorized generic strategy GSK is employing \"is a way, broadly speaking, to maximize the profitability of the product in question,\" said David Amsellem, a financial analyst who covers the industry at investment firm Piper Sandler. He noted there are currently no other generic versions of Flovent approved by the FDA. GSK did price the authorized generic lower than branded Flovent; one package of Flovent HFA in the 110 microgram dose, for example, costs $273.83, about 50% more than the $177.99 wholesale acquisition cost of its authorized generic counterpart, according to prices the company shared with CNN. The wholesale acquisition cost is the price before insurance and rebates. But CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager that determines which medicines are covered by insurance for its members, is giving preferential placement to another branded inhaler, Pulmicort, on its formulary, instead of the authorized generic versions of Flovent. \"In this case, the authorized generics were more expensive than the brand name medications,\" a CVS spokesman told CNN. He noted that's based on net prices, rather than the wholesale acquisition cost, meaning Pulmicort could be less expensive because of rebates its manufacturer, AstraZeneca, pays to obtain better insurance coverage. The fact that insurance plans aren't broadly covering the authorized generic of Flovent, said BMC's Cohen, \"means that patients are going to need to get a brand new prescription for a completely different medication in the middle of the worst possible time of year, which is the winter respiratory virus season.\" For patients with persistent asthma, Cohen said, Flovent has been the most commonly used daily preventive anti-inflammatory medication for decades. It shrinks swelling in the airways and reduces the body's exaggerated response to triggers that make it hard to breathe. During cold and flu season, she said, it becomes even more crucial to have that daily medicine. \"Flu, Covid, RSV - all these circulating viruses that are going around right now - are one of the biggest, if not the biggest, triggers for asthma attacks in kids,\" Cohen said. \"This is what leads to kids being in the emergency room.\" Cohen said she's concerned that patients, as well as physicians and pharmacists, don't know this change with Flovent is coming, and they need to act now to work out alternatives and determine insurance coverage. For some groups, the alternatives are more limited. For patients with a more rare inflammatory condition, called eosinophilic esophagitis, Flovent HFA is one of the most commonly prescribed topical steroids, and other medicines don't have as much data supporting their use in the condition, said Dr. Erin Syverson, an attending physician in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at Boston Children's Hospital. As EoE affects the esophagus, patients swallow the medicine instead of breathing it in, and it can tame the inflammation that can cause pain with swallowing or food getting stuck, requiring procedures to remove it. In kids, Syverson said, EoE can lead to recurrent vomiting, heartburn, belly aches, and trouble making progress starting solid foods, and Flovent can help keep the condition under control. \"With the discontinuation coming up, I worry it's going to just be one more hurdle for this patient population that already has very limited medications available to them,\" Syverson told CNN. \"I don't know what January is going to be like, but I'm worried.\" CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.

    "text": "(Minghui.org) Una residente de la ciudad de Jilin, provincia de Jilin, de 51 años, fue juzgada el 12 de enero de 2024 por su fe en Falun Dafa, una disciplina espiritual perseguida por el régimen comunista chino desde 1999. El procurador recomendó una sentencia de un año y medio al final de la audiencia, y el juez dijo que tendría que presentar la recomendación a sus superiores para su aprobación. La Sra. Wang Yuxia fue capturada por Chen Liheng, el jefe de la Estación de Policía de Tuchengzi, y sus cuatro subordinados la noche del 10 de septiembre de 2022. Además de la Sra. Wang, al menos dos practicantes más, el Sr. Li Gui y la Sra. Sun (nombre desconocido), fueron arrestados casi al mismo tiempo. A todos ellos les saquearon sus casas y les confiscaron sus libros de Falun Gong, el retrato del fundador de Falun Gong y sus teléfonos móviles. La policía esposó las manos de la Sra. Wang detrás de su espalda a la silla metálica de interrogatorio en la estación de policía. Fue puesta en libertad bajo fianza alrededor de las 3 de la mañana después de que la policía obligara a su familia a pagar una fianza de 2.000 yuanes (aprox. 280 dólares). La Procuraduría del distrito de Longtan engañó a la Sra. Wang para que se presentara ante ellos el 26 de octubre de 2022, con la excusa de cerrar su caso. Ella fue allí, sólo para que testificara. Después se le permitió regresar a su casa. La policía y los funcionarios del gobierno local acosaron a la Sra. Wang el 11 de noviembre de 2022 y le ordenaron que firmara una declaración para renunciar a Falun Gong. Ella se negó a obedecer. La policía obligó a su esposo a firmarla en su nombre. Más tarde ese mismo día, la policía llevó a la Sra. Wang para un examen físico y la liberaron. Posteriormente, el caso de la Sra. Wang fue remitido a la Procuraduría del distrito de Changyi. Nuevamente la engañaron para que fuera allí a firmar el expediente del caso. Su caso fue remitido a la Procuraduría de la ciudad de Jilin, que a su vez la acusó y remitió su caso al Tribunal de la ciudad de Jilin. Cuando la Sra. Wang compareció ante el Tribunal el 12 de enero de 2024, el procurador sugirió sentenciarla a un año y medio con una multa. El juez estuvo de acuerdo, pero dijo que tenía que presentar la recomendación a sus superiores para su aprobación antes de anunciarla. Antes de que la Sra. Wang comenzara a practicar Falun Gong, frecuentemente peleaba con su esposo, sus padres y hermanos. Practicar Falun Gong la ayudó a mejorar su relación con su familia y también le restableció la salud. Debido a que presentó una denuncia penal en 2015 contra Jiang Zemin, el exjefe del régimen comunista chino que ordenó la persecución a Falun Gong en 1999, la Sra. Wang fue acosada por cuatro agentes de la Estación de Policía de Jinzhuxiang en julio de 2015 y le ordenaron firmar una declaración renunciando a Falun Gong. La Sra. Wang fue arrestada nuevamente el 15 de agosto de 2017 por agentes de la Estación de Policía de Jinzhuxiang. Su casa fue saqueada.

    "text": "12 years on, Roboski families continue to carry traces of massacre As 12 years have passed since the massacre that killed 34 people, of whom 19 were children, in the Roboski village of the southeastern province of Şırnak, the village continues to carry traces of the massacre, with no suspects brought to justice and wounds kept unhealed. Then-Prime Minister Erdoğan did not keep his promises he gave in the aftermath of the massacre, said Sadık Alma who lost his son in the Turkish army airstrikes. Hacı Bişkin / Gazete Duvar Roboski villagers in the southeastern province of Şırnak and politicians commemorated on Dec. 28 those killed in an airstrike, as the village continues to exhibit pain and suffering 12 years on. A total of 34 people, mostly children, were killed in an airstrike by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) in Şırnak's border village of Roboski on Dec. 28, 2011. The bombs left bodies dismembered, with families unable to identify their loved ones. The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) Party co-chair Tülay Hatimoğulları also attended the commemoration. Sadık Alma, who lost his son 25-year-old Nadir Alma in the massacre, said that his pain is still fresh. Alma, who was among the delegation that met with the then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said that Erdoğan did not keep his promise he gave after the massacre. Alma said the attitude towards Kurds in Turkey has not changed 12 years on. “They tried to silence us. We did not remain silent. We resisted. Lawsuits were filed against us. But at this point, we, as Roboski families, have given up hope.” Then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with the Roboski families for the first time on July 26, 2013. “Erdoğan told us, 'I know about the case. I did not give the (airstrike) instruction. If you want, get the compensation, we will give you some positions from the state. I know everything. I promise to do my best.’ 12 years have passed. He didn't keep his promise. He was implicitly implying that the lawsuit we filed as Roboski families would not yield any results. That’s what happened,” Alma said. “They tried to silence us by offering (public employee) positions. If you are wondering, let me tell you that most of the compensation mentioned was not given either,” he added. Alma lastly noted that Erdoğan was covering up Roboski, but “the world knows what happened in Roboski. This massacre took place in front of the world.” Zeynep Encu, who lost 11 of her relatives in the airstrike, said they had more anger than mourning. “We were detained. Our houses were raided. A mother's son was murdered, one son was taken into custody, and one went to prison. The massacre was covered up. This silence made us very tired. We will not give up on our case. Many parties visited us. We have a request from them. When they go to the parliamentary rostrum, let them say justice to Roboski with one voice. Let them reopen the closed file,” she said. The Roboski families' search for justice both in domestic courts and in the international arena failed. Right after the massacre, the families filed a complaint in order for those responsible to be tried, but after years of waiting, a military prosecutor's office dismissed the case. The families in 2014 took the case to the Constitutional Court, which deemed it inadmissible due to errors in the submission that stemmed from the Şırnak Bar Association's serious mistakes. The latest blow to the Roboski families was dealt by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) when it dismissed their appeal on the grounds that domestic legal means weren't exhausted since the files weren't submitted properly to the Constitutional Court. On the other hand, former main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) deputy Levent Gök had a monument built for Roboski with the proceeds of his book “Roboski: Uludere’s Tears,” Ceren Bayar from Gazete Duvar reported. The monument, which could not be placed due to winter conditions, will be placed in the village when the winter conditions disappear. \"I commemorate with mercy the 34 civilians who were bombed and murdered in Uludere 12 years ago. We will not let this massacre be forgotten until all those responsible, who are protected because of a lack of effective investigation, are tried and the truth is revealed,\" CHP leader Özgür Özel said in a tweet. Uludere'de 12 yıl önce bombalanarak katledilen 34 sivil yurttaşımızı rahmetle anıyorum.— Özgür Özel (@eczozgurozel) Bu katliamı etkili soruşturma yapılamadığı için korunan tüm sorumlular yargılanana ve gerçekler açığa çıkana kadar unutturmayacağız.

The Nashville, Tennessee, local has grown into one of the exciting faces of IndyCar racing in America. His rise in stature has also helped him become a household name in the world of IndyCar racing.\nAd The two-time (2017, 2019) NTT IndyCar Series champion, who recently spoke on a podcast, detailed how he used to attend races in Bristol, Tennessee. The Team Penske driver also stressed how he remembers feeling the amazing atmosphere and the goosebumps that came with watching the NASCAR Xfinity series during his younger years.\nSpeaking with veteran NASCAR series driver Corey LaJoie on the Stacking Pennies podcast, the two-time (2023, 2024) Indy 500 champion detailed:\n“…So, I’m from Tennessee. I’m a Nashville guy, and some of the few races that I actually went to as a kid in person were in Bristol, you know. So I saw Nashville Superspeedway, I saw some races in Bristol—those were the places where I saw NASCAR races. I’m like, ‘This is awesome.’ Yeah, if I’m in the stadium at Bristol, I’m like, ‘These are gladiators. No, this is amazing.’ Ad Trending …When I think NASCAR, like, this is the stuff.” (00:10 onwards) Expand Tweet Ad Newgarden, despite his deep admiration for NASCAR, never pursued a career in stock car racing. Instead, he has left an indelible mark on IndyCar, winning two series championships and securing back-to-back Indianapolis 500 victories.\nThe former Ed Carpenter Racing driver will now shift his focus to the next race of the ongoing season, slated for the Thermal Club circuit in California. Notably, Newgarden is in his 14th season in the IndyCar.\nJosef Newgarden takes the Buc-ee's challenge Josef Newgarden recently participated in the Buc-ee's $10 challenge. The challenge largely involves sports stars trying to purchase as many items as possible with a $10 voucher made available to them by the Texas-based outlet (renowned chain of travel centers and convenience stores).\nAd The IndyCar star, who was on a trip to Texas, shared his experience participating in the now-viral challenge.\nTaking to his Instagram, the 34-year-old driver wrote:\n\"Currently on a road trip in TX. Is there a @bucees $10 challenge? I think that should be a thing… and Lee concurs,\" Newgarden captioned his post on Instagram. Ad Newgarden completed the challenge in style, managing to grab a drink, a pack of candy, and a box of chips—all within the $10 limit, even keeping a few extra bucks for himself.\nThe 31-time IndyCar Grand Prix winner has often entertained fans with his off-track activities, and this was yet another lighthearted moment that showcased the fun side of the Team Penske driver. He has 59 podiums and 20 poles to his credit.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

    "title": "EDITORIAL: City deals a fair blow to hatred | Coeur d'Alene Press",
    "text": "EDITORIAL: City deals a fair blow to hatred Speech is still free in Coeur d’Alene. Just pull up a chair at your favorite watering hole, listen to passionate political partisans at the park, or check out what’s being said anywhere people believe they’re not being overheard. You’ll hear free speech loud and sometimes cringingly clear. But what is not free, thanks to the City Council’s unanimous adoption of a municipal hate crime law, is “the commission of certain, already established crimes, but motivated by a person’s actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical or mental disability, or national origin.” Put more simply, harass somebody for any of the above reasons — infringe on the very rights you demand for yourself — and now you might actually pay. In addressing the City Council, Tony Stewart, our region’s civil rights leader, put it perfectly: “We are appalled at the suggestion that constitutionally protected hate speech can cross that line to say one can vocally berate, bully, intimidate, harass and demand the victims leave our beautiful city and not return,” said Stewart, representing the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations Board of Directors. The problem is that our beautiful city has sprung some very ugly leaks. With an actual municipal law now on the books, the ugliness isn’t likely to go away — that’s going to take a lot more work by a lot more people — but at least it can be discouraged by fines, community service and even jail time. The accused will still have to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in court, which is likely to be no simple task. And that’s as it should be. City officials also noted that this isn’t some knee-jerk bureaucratic overreaction to a spate of reprehensible acts in the past year or so. The new municipal law mirrors that of many other cities across the nation, communities that felt compelled to fill the gap left by state and federal laws that perhaps unwittingly allowed room for the infringement on some citizens’ most basic rights. While Coeur d’Alene is Kootenai County’s largest city, it is not the only one with an intense desire to treat all residents and visitors respectfully. That’s why adoption of a similar law in Post Falls, Hayden, Rathdrum, Dalton Gardens, Spirit Lake, Athol and elsewhere would be a positive step for the broader community. As City Councilman Dan Gookin aptly noted, racists can still be racists. They simply won’t be able to maliciously harass others with the expectation of impunity.",

    "text": "El regreso al montículo de Andy Vargas, después de las molestias en el brazo de lanzar, es una de las mejores noticias que han recibido los aficionados de Industriales antes del inicio de la Serie Nacional 63, que arrancará el venidero 9 de marzo. Los análisis clínicos realizados al pítcher de los azules mostraron la presencia de cuerpos libres y un poco de líquido corrido en su codo, por lo que fue necesario intervenirlo quirúrgicamente, poniendo fin a su participación en la campaña beisbolera. Luego de nueve salidas como relevista, acumulaba siete aperturas con un promedio de carreras limpias por juego (PCL) de 2.86 y un sorprendente Whip de 1.13, en 63 entradas de labor. Antes, en la primera Liga Élite, salió en 10 ocasiones al rescate, se anotó tres salvamentos y dejó un PCL de 0.47, actuación que lo llevó a reforzar el equipo Agricultores que participó en la Serie del Caribe de Caracas, Venezuela. Gracias a los profesores José Manuel Cortina y Ebri Pablo Martínez, el preparador físico Aldo Miguel Iser y la tríada médica del equipo nacional con el doctor Francisco Montesinos y el fisioterapeuta Javier Pérez, además del apoyo de su madre, pareja, amistades, familia, y en especial del colectivo médico del Hospital Ortopédico Frank País, el diestro felino está de vuelta y será uno de los abridores del conjunto capitalino en el próximo torneo beisbolero.
