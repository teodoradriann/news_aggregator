Venezuela había conseguido neutralizar la presión que le impuso el cuadro boliviano durante los primeros minutos con las proyecciones de Roberto Fernández y Héctor Cuellar quien abusó del juego fuerte generando faltas que parecían darle oxígeno al equipo llanero. Pero cuando parecía que el cuadro ‘Vinotinto’ podía empezar a elaborar, una jugada individual de Ramiro Vacca, hizo que la defensa redoble sus esfuerzos en vano, pues el jugador de 25 años se hizo los espacios para sacar un remate desde fuera del área y se clavara en el ángulo derecho de un sorprendido Rafael Romo..

    "text": "MAUI, Hawaii – Yasushi Nemoto pastors Kahului Union Church on Maui on the opposite side of the island from Lahaina. As the fires started burning on August 8, 2023, Nemoto and others in Kahului were not completely aware of what was going on that day. Then, the sheer volume of smoke signaled the severity of the situation. Intense winds from a Pacific hurricane hundreds of miles south of Hawaii combined with a dry summer to generate a rapid fire. “We could see the fire moving toward the south, kind of like paper burning from one side to the other – that fast,” said Nemoto. “We could feel that this wasn’t the brush fire we usually see. Brush fires are a daily story.” Kahului Union is a Japanese-English congregation and according to the church’s website has the only Japanese language ministry in Maui. “One of my church members called me,” Nemoto recalled. “I got the question, ‘What is going on?’ I said, ‘I see the fire behind you, so you better get out.’” The fire consumed the town of Lahaina, and the confirmed death toll as of mid-February 2024 surpassed 100 victims. Nemoto’s description of the carnage reflected what he had seen in history books: “It looked like an air raid.” John and Gay Williams, who lead the Hawaii Pacific Baptist Convention’s (HPBC) Southern Baptist Disaster Relief (SBDR) team as co-directors, immediately began contacting Hawaii Baptist churches to engage them in the response. In the initial days after the disaster, the SBDR centered its activity primarily on coordinating housing for first responders and other volunteers after Maui County officials asked Hawaii SBDR to take the lead in managing those who stayed at a hotel building in Kihei that was then owned by Haggai International. “We began the process of checking people in and out,” said Michael Fujimoto, a volunteer with Hawaii SBDR of nearly 20 years, starting with Hurricane Katrina in 2005. During SBDR’s annual roundtable meeting in January, Fujimoto was named one of the volunteers of the year for 2023. “We had to work out the cleaning schedule for the maintenance crew. We also were in charge of managing all of the maintenance work orders and passed those along to the crew,” Fujimoto said. “At the beginning, it was a whole different ballpark for us because we had to go completely into hotel management and be in charge of the facilities.” Several weeks went by before volunteers were allowed to assist Lahaina homeowners with property recovery, a process in the aftermath of fires known as an “ash-out,” where volunteers sift through burned out remains in hopes of finding belongings that survived the flames. “We had the unique opportunity,” said Gay Williams. “It was just Samaritan’s Purse and SBDR who had the opportunity to do the sifting.” By Dec. 22, SBDR had helped with more than 500 properties and welcomed more than 300 volunteers from 20 states. They were able to contact more than 650 families. “Hawaii Pacific Baptists have been encouraged by the support from sister state conventions and Send Relief and all Southern Baptists in the wake of the devastating fires on Maui,” said Craig Webb, executive director-treasurer of the HPBC. Send Relief partnered with HPBC, sending multiple shipments of supplies and support for the response through SBDR and the local churches who directly supported some of the 11,000 people who were displaced by the fires. “We were honored to provide financial support to our Baptist partners and Southern Baptist Disaster Relief, to ship fire clean-up supplies to SBDR teams on the ground for the response and to support churches as they minister on the island to their communities,” said Coy Webb, Send Relief’s crisis response director (no relation to Craig Webb). “Send Relief was able to be a partner in providing real help and the hope of Christ to survivors of the worst natural disaster in Hawaiian history.” Nemoto, after meeting with local chaplains, recognized the need for a Japanese translator who could let the 30 or so Japanese families in the area know about the support SBDR could provide them. He translated SBDR’s public call for people who needed help to respond, posted it to social media and connected a few Japanese survivors with volunteers who conducted ash-out. Two of the ladies he was able to serve were surprised at how volunteers from across the United States could have immediate camaraderie. “Disaster Relief, we have the same basic training. We all have the same color T-shirt, but every shirt has a different state listed,” Nemoto said. “She was impressed by how close the volunteers were though we’d never met before. I told her, ‘This is the power of Jesus Christ.’” The second lady lost everything in the fire. A group of volunteers from North Carolina were unable to help her recover any valuables from her property, but she walked away impressed by the prayer and the care they showed her, Nemoto said. The recovery effort transitioned to a new phase ahead of Christmas last year, and the Army Corps of Engineers moved in to begin removing steel, concrete and other major debris to prepare to rebuild, a process that will take months, if not years. “We have contact information for all these homeowners,” said John Williams. “Our next step is, we want to continue to minister to them and let them know we’re still here for them and want to help even though the physical recovery might be over for now. We want to build that spiritual connection and point them to a local church that can help them.”",

    "title": "Oil and gas CEOs to testify before House of Commons environment committee - Business in Vancouver",
    "text": "Canadians who have personally been impacted by climate change and extreme weather were in Ottawa Thursday, calling on the federal government to move quickly to implement its proposed cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector. A small group of individuals spoke to reporters at a press conference organized by Climate Action Network, just hours before executives of some of Canada's largest oil and gas companies were slated to testify before a parliamentary committee about their efforts to reduce their industry's emissions. The group included a woman who lost her Kelowna, B.C. home in last year's wildfires, a woman from Merritt, B.C. who lived through severe flooding in 2021, and a man from Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., who is concerned about the threat posed by rising sea levels to his Arctic community. \"I came to Ottawa to share my story because I think climate change is not an abstract concept,\" said Meghan Fandrich, a resident of Lytton, B.C., which is slowly starting to rebuild after more than 90 per cent of the village was destroyed in a 2021 wildfire. \"It is not something that will affect us someday ... it is ongoing. \"We need to do what we can, and one step we could take that would have a phenomenal effect is putting a really firm cap on carbon emissions.\" CEOs and senior executives from Cenovus Energy Inc., Enbridge Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd. and Suncor Energy Inc. are slated to appear by videoconference Thursday afternoon before the House of Commons standing committee on environment and sustainable development. Their appearance is the result of an April motion by NDP environment critic Laurel Collins, who called on the executives to appear before the committee to explain their companies' affect climate change. The oil and gas sector is Canada’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for almost a third of the country's total emissions, and they continue to rise, largely because of increased production from Alberta's oilsands. The federal government has proposed a legislated cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector, something the industry opposes. On Thursday, Collins said Canadians are concerned about the growing number of extreme weather events such as wildfire, drought and \"heat domes\" as the climate warms. Some Canadian oil and gas companies made record profits in 2022 as commodity prices soared in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the industry continues to generate healthy cash flows this year. Collins said companies can and should do more to mitigate the impact of the fossil fuel sector on the climate. \"We need an excess profit tax (on the oil and gas sector) to invest in climate solutions,\" she told reporters. Collins also called on the Liberal government not to delay or weaken its promised cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector. Under a proposed framework released last December, the government has suggested a cap that would require the sector to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 38 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030. The sector would also have the option to buy offset credits or contribute to a decarbonization fund that would lower that requirement to cutting just 20 to 23 per cent. The government has said the cap is intended to limit pollution, not oil and gas output, but the oil and gas sector has said the targets are too stringent and would result in companies cutting production. The proposed emissions cap is also staunchly opposed by the province of Alberta, and business groups such as the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. The oil and gas sector has said rather than a legislated cap, it needs federal and provincial support to help it accomplish its own emissions-reduction plans. A group of oilsands companies — including Imperial, Cenovus and Suncor, all of whom are slated to testify Thursday — have jointly committed to getting to net-zero emissions by 2050. The oilsands companies, which call themselves the Pathways Alliance, have proposed spending $16.5-billion on a massive carbon capture and storage network for northern Alberta. But the group has not yet made a final investment decision, saying more certainty about the level of government support and funding for the project is required. Clean energy think-tank the Pembina Institute said Thursday that federal and provincial measures to support emissions-reducing investments — such as industrial carbon pricing and announced federal tax credits — are generous, even compared with some of the incentives that exist in the U.S. In an email Thursday morning, Pembina's oil and gas program director MC Bouchard said it's urgent that companies take action. \"Today's hearing is another reminder that additional regulation is needed to make sure those promised investments and projects finally start to move forward,\" she said.

    "text": "By Piers Mucklejohn ,\n28 minutes ago\nMotorists have been warned of lengthy delays as parts of the M25 close over the weekend, which could see the hottest day of the year so far.\nThe motorway – which is Britain’s busiest – will be closed in both directions between junctions 9 and 10 in Surrey from 9pm on Friday until 6am on Monday while concrete beams for a new bridge are installed.\nSaturday is predicted to see temperatures rise as high as 26C in parts of south-east England , including around London , in what would be the hottest day of the year.\nDiversion routes will take cars on a 19-mile journey on A roads, crossing from Surrey into London’s Ulez area, though National Highways has assured drivers “no enforcement action will be taken”.\nBut the highways authority said anyone who ignores official diversion signs in an attempt to find shorter alternative routes will be liable for the £12.50 daily Ulez fee if their vehicle does not meet minimum emissions standards.\nFailure to pay the charge when required can result in a £180 fine, reduced to £90 if paid within 14 days.\nThe RAC advised motorists to avoid travelling if possible and pack extra food and drink if they do, as the closures are likely to bring long delays for thousands of drivers.\nAlice Simpson, RAC breakdown spokesperson, said: “As this next M25 weekend closure immediately follows major national rail strikes which could see many more people take to the roads, it could be up to six days of disrupted travel for London’s drivers.\nWith weekend temperatures reaching 25 degrees or even higher, it’s likely that routes around the 23-mile diversion will be busy as people make the most of the fine weather and jump in the car for day trips\nAlice Simpson, RAC “The closures also coincide with the retrofitting of new emergency areas on all-lane-running stretches of the M25, meaning delays are likely between junctions 5 and 7 in Surrey and Kent and junctions 23-27 in Hertfordshire and Essex.\n“With weekend temperatures reaching 25 degrees or even higher, it’s likely that routes around the 23-mile diversion will be busy as people make the most of the fine weather and jump in the car for day trips.\n“Anyone heading to Chessington World of Adventures, which is close to the official A3 diversion route, should expect delays and pack extra food and drink in the event they’re on the road longer than expected.\n“Holidaymakers heading to Gatwick or Heathrow should leave an hour earlier than usual and allow plenty of time for parking and security checks.”\nThe M25 closure is the second of five planned weekend closures which come as part of a £317 million project to improve Junction 10.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Ist Weidegang für Pferde bei Hitze gefährlich?\nPralle Sonne und heiße Temperaturen sind für Pferde belastend. Sollte man daher bei Hitze auf den Weidegang verzichten?\nPferde brauchen jeden Tag mehrere Stunden die Möglichkeit, sich frei zu bewegen. Etwa auf der Koppel oder dem Paddock. Allerdings reagieren Pferde sehr empfindlich auf Hitze. An heißen Tagen droht die Gefahr eines Hitzschlags. Besonders wenn es schwülwarm ist, ist die Belastung für Pferde groß. Auch auf direkte Sonneneinstrahlung reagieren Pferde empfindlich. Sollte man deshalb im Sommer auf Weidegang verzichten? Das kann natürlich nicht die Lösung sein. Schließlich dient der Weidegang nicht nur der freien Bewegung, sondern auch der Pflege von Sozialkontakten und dem Aufnehmen von Sinneseindrücken. Wie Pferdebesitzer den Weidegang für ihre Pferde im Sommer optimal gestalten und was auf einer Pferdeweide nicht fehlen darf, lesen Sie jetzt auf Landtiere.de.",

    "text": "He might be living half a world away in Michigan these days, but New Zealand track and field legend Nick Willis is all over the rise of teenage middle distance star Sam Ruthe, and he couldn't be more pumped.\nRuthe, who's just 15, became the youngest runner in history to break the four-minute barrier for the mile in Auckland last night, clocking 3m 58.35s.\nHis performance is generating huge excitement in the New Zealand athletics scene, with five-time Olympian and two-time medalist in the 1500m Willis, who spoke on RNZ's Morning Report, vying to be at the top of that list.\n\"He's just going from strength to strength, said Willis.\n\"Everything he seems to touch this season has turned to gold, and what a brilliant way to cap it off with the first ever sub four-minute mile by a 15-year-old.\"\nRuthe's been sensational this summer,\nHe also become the youngest to ever win a New Zealand senior title, after winning the 3000m in Napier.\nHe then added the 1500m in Dunedin last week, deadheating with Tokyo and Paris Olympian Sam Tanner, who paced for Ruthe in the cool and wet conditions at Mt Smart last night.\nWillis plans to keep a very close eye on how Ruthe progresses, and has extra reason to, having run against his dad and old mate, Ben, back in the day.\nWillis expects doors will now open with opportunities for Ruthe, if they haven't already, but is confident, he'll handle whatever the future brings.\n\"Ben Ruthe used to beat me quite handily when I was entering High School in the Wellington running scene back in the late 1990s,\" said Willis.\n\"But (while) he didn't quite make it, he's really careful.\n\"He's reached out to me a few times, just to make sure he's not going to get tempted by some early offerings by some of the major shoe companies or the major universities.\"\nAnd Willis reckons being patient is super important at this time, as there might be some out there who are willing to be a little bit more sinister, and manipulate parents into rushing certain decisions.\n\"Sam has brilliant and wise counsel surrounding him...people that not only know how to shelter him, but also help foster his talent to the best of his ability.\n\"He is in very good hands,\" he said.\nRuthe is next in action in Melbourne next weekend, when he runs in the 1500m at the Maurie Plant Meet.\nSign up for Ngā Pitopito Kōrero, a daily newsletter curated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

    "title": "Rivian (RIVN) CEO says R2 will be its Tesla Model 3 moment",
    "text": "Although Rivian (RIVN) and Tesla have different products, they are more alike than you may think. Rivian’s CEO RJ Scaringe said its upcoming R2 model will be its version of the Tesla Model 3.\nIt may not look like a Tesla Model 3, but Rivian’s R2 will help shape the EV startup’s future. Like Tesla, Rivian started with more expensive flagship models.\nTesla released the Roadster in 2008, which led to the Model S in 2012. Several years later, Tesla announced its first mass-market electric car, the Model 3 .\nAlthough Tesla went through what CEO Elon Musk described as “production hell” ramping up the Model 3, the work paid off. In 2018, Tesla’s Model 3 became the best-selling EV globally, holding the title until the Model Y topped it in 2020.\nTesla’s Model 3 will be among the top-selling vehicles globally (gas or electric) in 2023 as it continues to see strong demand.\nRivian has been ramping production all year. Despite several rivals cutting EV targets, Rivian raised its production goal following strong Q3 results. The EV maker now aims to build 52,000 vehicles this year. That’s more than double the 24,337 it produced last year.\nRivian R1T (Source: Rivian) Rivian R2 will be its Tesla Model 3 moment Like Tesla, Rivian plans to expand into new markets. The automaker chose Clayco as its partner earlier this month to build its massive $5 billion EV plant in Georgia.\nThe new facility will be home to Rivian’s R2 vehicles. Scaringe previously said R2 will start at around $40,000 to $50,000. Rivian’s R2 will be a mid-size electric SUV.\nOn the How I Built This podcast with Guy Raz, Scaringe recently spoke about ramping production and expanding the brand, as well as other plans for the future.\nRivian R1S (Source: Rivian) When asked if R2 will be Rivian’s version of the Tesla Model 3, Scaringe said that “strategically, it’s very similar.”\nScaringe explained that Rivian started with its flagship R1 products that are intentionally priced higher for their features, capabilities, and more.\nRivian will take the “essence of the brand” represented in those products and build it into more affordable models.\nRivian production at its Normal, Ill facility (Source: Rivian) The Rivian R2 is expected to be unveiled for the first time next year before launching in 2026. Construction on the Georgia site will begin soon, with grading work finishing up through the end of the year.\nAn official groundbreaking ceremony is expected in early 2024. Once the first stage is complete, Rivian expects to be able to build 200,000 EVs a year. By 2030, the EV maker looks to double it.\nElectrek’s Take Rivian continues outpacing rivals despite the R1T electric truck and R1S SUV costing around $70,000.\nThe company also has a major lifeline with its commercial electric van. E-commerce giant Amazon announced in 2019 that it would deploy 100,000 Rivian EDVs by 2030. It has already deployed over 10,000.\nThe EV maker recently ended its exclusivity with Amazon, signing its second partner in AT&T earlier this month.\nRivian drivers will also get access to Tesla’s supercharger network. Starting early next year, Rivian will provide an adapter, and eventually, it will move to the NACS connector.\nThe EV maker is taking another page from Tesla with its own charging network. Rivian is focusing on reliability and uptime like the EV leader. Scaringe said having several different charging providers can help adoption. It plans to open its network to other brands like Tesla.\nScaringe said it has around 60 Adventure Network sites live, but there are hundreds more to build.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.",
