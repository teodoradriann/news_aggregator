    "text": "The price of fuel ought to retail at a minimum Sh168 for super petrol and Sh151 for diesel if the government obeyed court orders. While releasing the prices for August 14 to September 14 the Energy Regulatory Authority (Epra) said the prices will remain at the current pump rates of Sh188 for Super petrol and Sh171 for diesel. The Court of Appeal on July 31, in the case of National Assembly & Another v Okiya Omtatah Okoiti & 55 Others (Judgment), declared the entire Finance Act, 2023 (Finance Act) unconstitutional. It is this bill that pushed the VAT rate of fuel from 8 per cent to 16 per cent. A reversal of the same should have been reflected on the new rates. In a separate case, the Mombasa High Court yesterday declared the recent increase of the Road Fuel Levy from Sh18 to Sh25 unconstitutional. This rate too is still factored in the cost of fuel for the next one month. However, instead of abiding by the decisions of the court the government announced it will continue subsidising petroleum pump prices over the next one month. This move, they said, saw the retail prices remain unchanged in the latest maximum petroleum pump prices published by Epra Wednesday. Digging into public coffers to stabilise fuel prices is despite the government’s continued push for higher taxes from fuel. In the prices published by Epra this week, the regulator had retained value-added tax (VAT) at 16 per cent despite the Court of Appeal ruling that the law that doubled VAT on fuel from eight per cent was unconstitutional. Last month, the Transport Ministry also increased the Road Maintenance Levy to Sh25 from Sh18 per litre of super petrol and diesel, dashing hopes of lower fuel prices in the country. Old prices Over the next one month, super petrol will continue retailing at Sh188.84 per litre in Nairobi. Diesel will retail at Sh171.60 while kerosene will go for Sh161.75. Super petrol will get a subsidy of Sh3.40, diesel Sh5.20 and kerosene Sh3.83 per litre. This would translate to spending about Sh400 million over the next one month in subsidising super petrol going by the average monthly consumption of 120 million litres and Sh900 million subsidising diesel whose monthly consumption stands at about 180 million litres. The subsidies are despite the push for higher taxes even in instances the court has ruled otherwise. Industry players had noted that reducing VAT to eight per cent would have a significant impact on pump prices. Halving VAT on fuel could have knocked off more than Sh10 off the retail price of super petrol. VAT currently stands at Sh26 per litre of petrol and Sh23 per litre of diesel. “In the period under review, the maximum allowed petroleum pump price for super petrol, diesel and kerosene remain unchanged... The prices are inclusive of 16 per cent VAT in line with provisions of the Finance Act, 2023,” said Epra in their statement on Wednesday. The Act, which came into force in July last year had increased the cost of petroleum products by doubling VAT to 16 per cent from the earlier eight per cent. The government appealed the decision at the Supreme Court and had also requested a stay order as the case was heard and determined but the Court rejected National Treasury’s plea. A stay order would have meant that the government would continue collecting taxes introduced by the Finance Act, 2023, including VAT on fuel at 16 per cent. The rejection of the plea has since thrown taxpayers into confusion following the failure of KRA to align its systems with the ruling. The Federation of Kenya Employers last week noted that KRA had not adjusted its tax systems to reflect the ruling by the Court of Appeal, adding that this had its members and other taxpayers are unable to remit taxes “in accordance with the judgement for reason that the KRA has not yet configured its systems to comply with the Court of Appeal judgement.” The Petroleum Outlets Association of Kenya (Poak) earlier yesterday noted that the industry is “keen to see the revision of the VAT from 16 per cent to eight per cent.” This, the lobby for small and mid-sized oil marketers in the country had noted, would “reduce the pump prices significantly”. Yesterday’s price capping guide is the second since the substantial hike in the Road Maintenance Levy. Road levy increase The Transport Ministry in July, just days before Epra announced fuel prices for the July-August cycle, increased the levy by Sh7 to Sh25 from Sh18. The levy is used by road agencies to undertake repairs of roads across the country. Kenyans have protested that the levy was hiked without proper consultation and also without considering the plight of Kenyans who are currently grappling with the high cost of living and stagnant or reduced incomes. Earlier in the day, the new Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Opiyo Wandayi took over the key docket, saying among his areas of priority would be to look into ways to bring down the cost of both fuel and electricity. “We have a cardinal duty to ensure that we provide services in the energy realm that are affordable, sustainable, reliable to the people,” he said, adding he would work to systematically reduce the cost of both fuel and electricity.",

    "text": "Um deputado do Partido Socialista Unido da Venezuela (PSUV), do qual faz parte o ditador Nicolás Maduro, realizou nos últimos dias diversas postagens antissemitas em sua conta oficial no X (antigo Twitter) onde elogia abertamente o ditador nazista Adolf Hitler e ataca o Estado de Israel e os judeus. Alberto Aranguibel, que representa o estado de Miranda e integra a Comissão Permanente do Poder Popular e Comunicação do Parlamento venezuelano, afirmou em uma de suas publicações que Hitler “não merecia ter abandonado a vida tão prematuramente” e que “lhe faltava muito por fazer com sua grande obra em benefício da humanidade”.\nO perfil de Aranguibel no X, que se identifica como um chavista, está repleto de postagens com mensagens de ódio direcionada aos judeus.\nEm outra publicação, o chavista chegou a escrever que “o que Hitler fez ontem contra os judeus estava correto. Não há outra interpretação”, em referência ao Holocausto, o genocídio de 6 milhões de judeus durante o regime nazista alemão. Além disso, Aranguibel também repostou uma resposta de um usuário que dizia: \"Totalmente de acordo. Os judeus são inimigos do mundo\".\nAs postagens do deputado chavista foram repudiadas pelo Centro Simón Wiesenthal, organismo internacional de direitos humanos que enfrenta o racismo, a xenofobia, a discriminação, o terrorismo e o antissemitismo. Segundo informações do portal argentino Infobae , o escritório latino-americano do centro escreveu em sua conta no X que \"quando, da esquerda, reivindicam o maior odiador da história, fica claro que o ódio é ambidestro. E o alvo comum é o judeu. O antissemitismo está sempre presente quando a democracia e a convivência na diversidade estão ausentes”.\nVeja Também:\nMaduro ordena “ação defensiva” no Atlântico antes que navio britânico chegue à Guiana\nCIDH considera governo da Venezuela responsável por massacre em 2018\nDe Maduro e Díaz-Canel a Ebrahim Raisi: Lula se encontrou com 13 ditadores ao longo de 2023",

    "text": "Sports\nJimmy Butler Drops Hilarious Quote About Draymond Green’s Unmatched Competitive Nature\nGolden State Warriors forward Draymond Green put on a masterclass defending Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo on Tuesday.\nGreen matched up with Antetokounmpo for about seven minutes during the Warriors-Bucks game, and Milwaukee's superstar did not make a single shot when guarded by Green.\nDraymond locked up the Greek Freak\n- Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors)[pic.twitter.com/2OsFiOuHr8][March 19, 2025]\nAntetokounmpo, who averages 30.4 points per game, was limited to just 20 points and recorded his worst game as a shooter in two seasons, per ESPN. Green notched 10 rebounds, four blocks, and two steals during the game, helping the Warriors defeat the Bucks 104-93 without Steph Curry.\nNew Warriors star Jimmy Butler attributed Green's excellent defense of Antetokounmpo to his nature, joking that Green would even display that level of defensive ferocity going up against a five-year-old.\n\"He always like that,\" Butler said of Green after the win. \"Not just Giannis. He don't give a damn who he's going up against. If he's going up against a damn 5-year-old. He would hate for that individual to score on him. And he wouldn't want anybody to help him. He's like, 'This is my matchup. This is all me. I've gotta be able to get a stop.'\"\n\"He (Draymond) always like that. Not just Giannis. He don't give a damn who he's going up against. If he's going up against a damn 5 year old. He would hate for that individual to score on him. And he wouldn't want anybody to help him.\"\n- 95.7 The Game (@957thegame)\nMore from Jimmy on Draymond's defense[pic.twitter.com/7P7s9vtSHA][March 19, 2025]\nButler more seriously said of Green: \"I think you gotta respect the hell out of what he does. … Just lock in on defense. Every single possession down and get mad when anybody scores. Not just the guy he's guarding… He is a Hall of Famer for a reason. I just respect what he brings to this squad. What he brings to this locker room.\"\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr also offered high praise for Green's performance against Antetokounmpo. \"Draymond showed why he is still one of the great defenders in the world,\" Kerr said. \"It wasn't just the defense; it was the leadership, the energy.\"\nGreen believes his performance vaulted his name back into the Defensive Player of the Year conversation, and is now aiming for another DPOY award after previously winning the honor in 2017.\nMore of the Latest Around the NBA\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Jimmy Butler Drops Hilarious Quote About Draymond Green's Unmatched Competitive Nature.\nCopyright ABG-SI LLC.

    "title": "The most dangerous attack on Christianity in government and schools is intolerance from within | Opinion",
    "text": "Letters to the Editor\nThe most dangerous attack on Christianity in government and schools is intolerance from within | Opinion\nSchool setback\nDespite being a strong Christian, I am absolutely adamant against having any religion in public schools. I think this is dangerous to our freedom.\nMickey Dollens’ Feb. 16 guest commentary “Listen to a Baptist minister: Chaplains belong in churches — not in Missouri schools” (17A) made me think of my own experiences. When I went to a public high school, we had revivals. I also had science and history teachers who were ministers and unqualified. It set me back academically when I got to college.\n- Doris Foley, Independence\nProtect bishop\nPresident Donald Trump is creating a task force to eradicate anti-Christian bias in government. The first order of business of this task force should be to defend Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Washington, D.C. Consistent with a Christian precept that millions of Christians affirm, she publicly called on Trump to “have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.”\nFor this widely accepted interpretation of the teachings of Jesus, she has been viciously attacked. She is a “mental rapist” and an “instrument of the devil,” according to attacks online. One critic claimed that there was a “special place in hell” for her. Trump himself labeled her “nasty,” one of his favorite terms of derision for women. House Speaker Mike Johnson called her message of mercy “shameful.” A congressman claimed that she should be deported.\nWe’ve clearly reached a sad state when elected officials denounce a religious leader’s call for mercy.\nMany of Budde’s most ferocious critics purport to be “Christian.” The task force should target a serious threat to Christianity: the rigid intolerance of those who wield their religion as a cudgel to impose conformity, stifle dissent and promote hatred.\n- Robert L. Blake Jr., Columbia\nChiefs rebrand\nOn the heels of missing out on a “three-peat,” the Kansas City Chiefs can now spend time refocusing on their problematic name and image. Why not go with a fire chief logo? The colors can remain the same, and the arrowhead can be refashioned into a fire engine. A dalmatian would make a great mascot. Instead of offensive chants, fans could imitate siren sounds and maybe adopt little siren noisemakers.\nI submit this idea for the team’s consideration.\n- Sharon Miken, Lewes, Delaware\nNavalny’s bravery\nThe Feb. 19 story “Even in death, Navalny seen by the Kremlin as threat” (11A) emphasizes the impact this man continues to have and should not be forgotten. While most of the world views Russia as an eternal, hopeless land of oppression, Alexei Navalny’s nationwide anti-corruption organization believes that one day his homeland can transform its ways and become a democratic entity.\nAs recounted in his book “Patriot: A Memoir,” Navalny and his supporters have put their beliefs and longings into action, many resulting in arrest and imprisonment — and, like Navalny, giving their lives.\n- L. Grace Kohan, Independence\nUS interests\nCommon sense would indicate that it is our best interests to support Ukraine against the Russia-North Korea alliance.\nAccording to the U.S. Secret Service, the largest amount of counterfeit American currency is produced by the Pyongsong Trademark Printing Factory in North Korea.\nAccording to the World Cybercrime Index, Russia ranks first in producing malicious online activity, cyberattacks and network attacks against U.S. companies and citizens.\nIt’s interesting to note that on July 13, 2018, Donald Trump stated: “Russia, if you’re listening I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”\n- Holly John Blythe, Shawnee\nAvian threat?\nResearchers have discussed the possibility of developing a vaccine for chickens to halt the spread of bird flu.\nWill this give the chickens autism? I am eager to hear Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s expert opinion concerning this.\n- John R.W. Taylor, Kansas City\nMusk’s cuts\nElon Musk, under Donald Trump’s direction, has promoted indiscriminate firing of government employees, discontinuation of the USAID program and disruption of the highest-level biomedical research and training resources in the world with proposed National Institutes of Health cuts. However, Musk — through ownership of Tesla and SpaceX — has received at least $18 billion in federal payments over the past decade, including nearly $4 billion for SpaceX last year.\nI would much prefer my tax dollars go to humanitarian aid and medical research, which have saved millions of lives over the past decades, than support a rich man’s space folly. What reduction in federal spending will Musk’s programs see?\n- Howard Kilbride, Kansas City\nParty’s over\nAs a former, lifelong Republican, I am embarrassed by and for the MAGA movement. It has become a social club in worship to one man. That man is neither conservative nor a man of faith. To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson, what you do speaks so loudly that what you say I can’t hear.\nHe has proclaimed himself a king, though I believe the truth is far more dire. The leaders in his party operate from the position of “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.” Is that not heresy? What use do we have for politicians who lack free will and who routinely violate the Constitution and religious tenants in service to their new “god”?\nIs it not ironic that our Missouri politicians, one a bestselling author on “masculinity,” have freely ceded their own limited power and responsibilities to this man? There is nothing masculine about cowardice.\nPay attention America. This man is racing us toward apartheid.\nI am a conservative, independent American.\n- Jonathan Phillips, Osage Beach, Missouri",

Este logro no solo añade una medalla más a su brillante carrera, sino que también resalta su historia de superación, marcada por la adversidad desde el primer momento de su vida. Arnulfo Castorena, campeón olímpico El escritor y periodista Alberto Lati narra en su libro \"100 Glorias de México: de niños a campeones\" los retos que Arnulfo enfrentó desde su nacimiento. Te podría interesar Su madre falleció al dar a luz, y su padre lo abandonó al enterarse de que su hijo tenía discapacidades. Fue su abuela, Doña Teodosia, quien lo crió hasta que ingresó a un internado de rehabilitación dirigido por monjas. Fue en ese lugar donde, gracias a una monja apodada \"Sor Chiva\", por su pasión por el equipo de fútbol Guadalajara, Castorena descubrió su amor por la natación, dando inicio a una exitosa carrera deportiva. Sin embargo, la vida de Arnulfo no estuvo exenta de tragedias. Mientras estaba en el internado, recibió la devastadora noticia de la muerte de su abuela. Lo rescatan de las calles Luego, fue criado por una tía, pero al enfermarse ella, Arnulfo tuvo que salir adelante vendiendo chicles y limpiando parabrisas en las calles de Guadalajara. Siendo adulto, fue descubierto por un directivo del Consejo Estatal Deportivo de Jalisco (Code), quien lo invitó a entrenar en sus instalaciones. No obstante, al no poder cubrir la cuota exigida, continuó su entrenamiento de forma autodidacta en fuentes públicas de la ciudad. En una ocasión, mientras practicaba, rescató a un niño que había caído en aguas negras. A lo largo de su carrera, Arnulfo ha ganado siete medallas paralímpicas para México, incluyendo cuatro oros en los 50 metros pecho SB2 en Sídney 2000, Atenas 2004, Tokio 2020 y, ahora, París 2024, demostrando una vez más su perseverancia y talento.",

That’s like a small vacation!” exclaimed Alex, a self-proclaimed tech aficionado, upon hearing the rumored price. “Are thay serious?”\nThe leaked price , if accurate, represents a significant jump from previous Galaxy models, leaving many questioning whether the premium features will justify the hefty cost.”It seems high, and a lot of people are saying it’s a mistake,” shared Sarah, another tech enthusiast. “But who knows?”\nThe uncertainty surrounding the price has created a sense of anxious anticipation among potential buyers.\n“This is what I hate about leaks,” admitted Alex. “I was so excited, but now I’m stressing about whether I can even afford it.”\nDespite the concerns,many are choosing to remain optimistic,hoping that Samsung will unveil a more palatable price point at its official event on January 22nd.\n“Don’t panic just yet,” advised Sarah. “Remember, Samsung’s official event is on January 22nd, they’ll confirm everything then.”\nUntil then, tech enthusiasts are left to speculate and eagerly await the official announcement, hoping that the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s impressive rumored specs won’t come with an astronomical price tag.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Prices Leaked?

However, the numbers raised eyebrows, leading many to question their accuracy.\nQuestionable Pricing raises doubts The leaked prices for the base S25 model with 128GB of storage were listed at €973, with the 256GB and 512GB variants priced at €1,036 and €1,162 respectively.\nSimilarly, the S25+ was listed at €1,246 for the 256GB model and €1,371 for the 512GB version.\nThe top-of-the-line S25 Ultra, according to the retailer, would command a hefty €1,571 for the 256GB variant, €1,696 for 512GB, and a staggering €1,948 for the 1TB model.\nTaking it with a Grain of Salt Given the retailer’s haste in removing the listings, and the significant price discrepancies compared to previous models, many tech enthusiasts are skeptical. it’s possible these prices were placeholder entries, internal testing figures, or simply a mistake.\nUntil Samsung officially announces pricing during its january 22nd event, these leaked figures should be treated with caution.\nStay tuned to NewDirectory3.com for all the latest updates on the Samsung Galaxy S25 launch!",

    "text": "A scary moment unfolded in a spring training game between the Dodgers and Cubs on Thursday when Los Angeles pitcher Bobby Miller was hit by a 106 mph comebacker in the third inning. Cubs infielder Michael Busch sent Miller’s 80 mph pitch right back at Miller, nailing the 25-year-old righty in the side of the head and sent him crumbling to the ground. Miller immediately grabbed his head and attempted to compose himself as his teammates approached to check on him. Bobby Miller walked off after being hit in the head by a line drive pic.twitter.com/OTn0fHLNQP How Mets fans ‘bothered’ Steve Cohen during magical late-season run The Dodgers pitcher walked off the field under his own power. Miller came into the game — MLB’s first of the preseason — in the third inning and walked leadoff batter Vidal Brujan in the inning before Bush sent the screaming line drive right back at him. Miller is coming off a season in which he missed time with a shoulder injury and struggled with his mechanics. Dodgers open with best preseason win total since at least 1990 He found himself out of the Dodgers rotation and was sent down to the minor leagues in September of last season despite LA in need of pitchers. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER Miller told The Athletic recently that his shoulder “wasn’t right” last season. “At the end of the day, I was physically able to pitch, so there’s no excuse that I can make,” Miller told the outlet. “Just poor execution on my part is what it really comes down to and not having my normal pitch mix and command that I had the year before.” The Dodgers are hoping for a bounce-back in 2025, especially after he showed so much promise in 2023, and are hoping the quick kinship that Miller has made with offseason signing Blake Snell will help. “I don’t live in the past,” Snell said. “He shouldn’t either. Last year, you learn from and then focus on what he’s doing. He’ll learn. He’s such an amazing talent. I don’t ask him what he did last year because I don’t care. I think what he’s gonna do is way more important than what happened. Learn from it, get better, whatever it was going bad and then this year is this year.
