    "title": "Pizza Hut restaurants in California could lay off thousands as minimum wage law goes into effect – 95.5 WSB",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — With the minimum wage in California increasing to $20 an hour for fast food workers in 2024, some Pizza Hut franchisees say they're preparing to eliminate jobs as well as delivery options for customers. As first reported by ABC News Los Angeles station KABC, two major Pizza Hut franchisees with restaurants in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties are planning layoffs that would impact 1,200 workers. The mass layoffs would also reportedly impact another 800 workers at Pizza Hut locations in Sacramento, Central California, Southern Oregon, and the Reno-Tahoe area, according to KABC. The cuts would eliminate the franchisees' delivery services for customers in those locations, they said. Customers will instead have to rely on services like Uber Eats or DoorDash. \"Pizza Hut is aware of the recent changes to delivery services at certain franchise restaurants in California,\" a company spokesperson said Thursday. \"Our franchisees independently own and operate their restaurants in accordance with local market dynamics and comply with all federal, state, and local regulations, while continuing to provide quality service and food to our customers via carryout and delivery.\" The chain, which is owned by Yum! Brands, said access to delivery would continue to be available via the Pizza Hut mobile app, website and phone ordering. Other fast food companies including KFC and Taco Bell did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. The wage legislation, AB 1228, which was signed into law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in late September, is the catalyst for this decision by operators, the franchisees say. The new law goes into effect in April and will boost minimum wage to $20 per hour for fast food workers, $4 more than the state minimum wage of $16 that will be effective Jan. 1. Other fast food companies, including McDonald's and Chipotle, previously said the new law would impact the respective chains' operating costs and could potentially change menu pricing for customers. Although a decision has not been made official, Chipotle CEO Jack Hartung said on a November earnings call that the pricing at the popular fast-casual Mexican restaurant would have to change \"to take care of the dollar cost\" and cover the new margins. \"We are definitely going to pass this on. We just haven't made a final decision as to what level yet,\" he said. Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Boeing factory workers go on strike, rejecting latest contract offer",
    "text": "Nearly 33 thousand Boeing factory workers at several U.S. plants have gone on strike Friday at 12:01 a.m. after negotiations broke down. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union representing the workers rejected a contract offer that included a 25 per cent pay raise across four years, that the company said was “the largest ever general wage increase offer.” The union says that the offer was 40 per cent less than what they were asking for. In a vote made hours before the deadline, 94.6 per cent of the voting workers rejected the contract offer, and 96 per cent approved the work stoppage. “The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,” a spokesperson from Boeing told CHCH News. “We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.” The strike is another setback for the aerospace giant, whose reputation and finances have been hit by manufacturing problems and multiple investigations by the U.S. government this year. This is the first workers stoppage since 2008, and follows after a door panel blew off a 737 MAX jet during a flight in January.

    "title": "Aurora boreale a Genova: tutti con il naso all’insù per lo spettacolo notturno",
    "text": "Genova. Decine di genovesi la scorsa notte hanno affollato i tradizionali luoghi panoramici della città, dal Monte Fasce al Righi, dai Piani di Praglia a Creto, per osservare il cielo e gustarsi lo spettacolo della aurora boreale nei cieli di Genova. Parliamo dell’effetto della tempesta magnetica in corsi in questi giorni che produce un “arco aurorale rosso stabile che ieri sera, 10 ottobre 2024, ha colorato i cieli della Liguria come già avvenuto lo scorso 10 maggio, a cinque mesi esatti di distanza – come riporta l’Osservatorio astronomico del Righi in una nota stampa – E’ la conferma che questo ciclo di attività solare (il Sole presenta cicli di attività di durata pressoché undecennale) è il più intenso degli ultimi decenni”. Secondo le previsioni della Noaa l’indice Kp – una scala da 0 a 9 che indica l’attività geomagnetica globale – l’attività magnetica ha raggiunto un picco di 8,33 tra le 21.00 e le 23.00 e un altro picco di 8,00 tra le 5.00 e le 7.00 di questa mattina. L’origine della tempesta geomagnetica si trova nella macchia solare AR 3848, che martedì 8 ottobre ha prodotto un forte brillamento solare di classe X 1.8: i brillamenti di classe X sono quelli più potenti e quest’ultimo ha infatti innescato blackout radio nelle zone del nostro pianeta in quel momento rivolte verso il Sole. L’ultima volta che una violenta tempesta solare aveva colpito la Terra – ancora più forte di quella prevista nelle prossime ore – era esattamente cinque mesi fa . Centinaia di persone avevano fotografato sfumature viola e fucsia in cielo nei pressi di Genova. Le fotografie di copertina sono state riprese dal Monte Fasce da Marco Ferro, Salvatore Fontana e Simona Raviola (tutti parte dello staff dell’Osservatorio Astronomico del Righi) con una camera Canon EOS 6D e obiettivo zoom grandangolare a 17mm di focale. Entrambe sono frutto di singole pose da 13 secondi a 1600 ISO",
