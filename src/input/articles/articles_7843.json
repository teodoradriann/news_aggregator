    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Straight guy here in his late 40s married to a 40-year-old straight woman. We’ve been married for 16 years and have two young children. Our sex life is not satisfying, and I do not anticipate it will improve, as my wife is not open to much outside of weekly PIV, with one week off every month for her period, always in the same position.\nShe has given me one of two choices: I accept our sex life as-is or we divorce and move on. I feel satisfied with the other aspects of our marriage, and I don’t want to live separately from my children or break up our family. Is wanting a fulfilling sex life enough to blow everything else up? Should I suck it up for the sake of my family?\n— Despairing In Maryland\nIt’s always the partner who wants more sex or more sexual variety who gets told that asking for more sex or more varied sex risks “blowing everything else up.” But couldn’t the same be said to someone like Mrs. DIM? By refusing to consider adding anything to the rotation, isn’t she risking a blow-up too?\nI don’t want anyone having sex under duress to save their marriages, but if my husband was so unhappy with our sex life that he was considering leaving and/or cheating, I would be motivated to make some changes.\nSadly, DIM, you’re not married to me, and so you face a choice between sucking it up or blowing it up.\nI am a man. I met a beautiful Nepalese woman at work. The co-worker who introduced us basically told me this woman was unhappily married. We started spending time together, and we have now been seeing each other for almost three years. Everyone on my end knows about her, but only a few close friends of hers know.\nMost of her friends, also Nepalese, have told her that white men can’t be trusted, which I can’t really disagree with, given our history as a nation. And they are telling her that having a baby with her husband will improve their relationship. I think that’s the worst possible reason to have a kid, especially when the dude in question is an emotionally abusive POS.\nI love this woman. I don’t want to push her to do anything she’s not ready to do, or that she doesn’t want to do. That would make me no better than all the other men she’s had in her life. But I’m starting to feel like this isn’t going to happen.\nAm I an idiot to think she’ll ever leave him?\n— Leaving Isn’t My Best Option\nI’m not sure what your whiteness or your girlfriend’s Nepalese-ness have to do with your question, LIMBO, which is one I get all the time . You’re going to get the same answer everyone else gets: If she was gonna leave him for you, she would’ve already left.",

    "text": "Over Easy: Marvels in the heavens, and in the yard |Published: 04-11-2024 5:01 PM| It was Traffic vs. the Eclipse on Monday, a showdown of celestial proportions. Would I risk everything like Marco Polo who bravely set out to see the world, or follow the example of his brother Rocco, who said their hometown of Venice was “plenty good enough?” We stayed home. On Monday, at our cozy bungalow in West Lebanon, traffic was light and two bathrooms were within 25 feet of my lawn chair observatory. It was certainly pleasant. The skies were blue and bright with a thin veil of clouds drifting in the heavens. My brother and sister-in-law and two grown nephews drove up Monday morning from Massachusetts, happy to arrive after sessions of stop-and-go traffic on the interstates. We don’t see them often enough, so this was an occasion. I had debated with myself — these monologues can go on for days — whether to settle for the near-total eclipse here or make a hero’s journey to Montpelier or St. Johnsbury, Vt., for the full Monty. Video clips of the 1969 Woodstock Music Fest played in my mind. What if things went really bad and we were stuck for three days in muddy fields? I am too old now to take the brown acid and prance naked in the mud. Also, I like to drive home before dark. To tell you the truth, I was not overly excited. When I was in grammar school we had a partial eclipse that was much hyped but not anything near 100%. They told us to make pinhole contraptions to project a circle onto another paper. I saw a blur that looked like a dead tick. This time the view was much better, thanks to solar glasses. Still, I was not comfortable staring at the sun for long. Some instinct or maybe mythology — stories where everyone ends up blind, dead or turned into goats — made me wary of ogling it. My nephews had done some actual research about the eclipse, and had a phone app that announced things like “first contact” in an authoritative voice the likes of which I hadn’t heard since the original Star Trek. They also brought a spatula with round holes that projected mini circles onto a white sheet if held just right. The holes changed shape as the moon elbowed its way in front of the sun. Gadzooks! What sorcery is this! A couple of neighborhood kids strolled by to update us about karate and current boy facts, such as birthdays, school and other essentials. Their minds were not on the skies, just the rolling wonder of growing up. A cat slinked over and checked us out, perhaps amused by our odd change in behavior — humans, you never know what they are up to. Article continues after... Yesterday's Most Read Articles We kept looking skyward. The moon seemed to be nibbling away at the sun. When the eclipse reached 99% or so, the air grew cooler, the light oddly dimmed, and the phone app called out “peak,” or something like that. I whooped. Someone on a nearby street honked a horn. Several mosquitoes came from somewhere and one tried to bite my brother’s forehead. I thought our experience was fine, fun, interesting. My daughter sent a photo from her phone in Rangeley, Maine, where she and friends had gone for peak eclipse. The sky looked dark, exotic, stunning. I sighed. After our company left (hurrying to beat the traffic, which they did), I hopped into the car and took a ride to places where I could observe interstate traffic. It was busy, but not “crazy’’ or “insane” as I’d read on the internet. But wait, there was more to come. Someone I know posted online that it took her 6 hours to return to the Upper Valley from St. Johnsbury. Yikes. WCAX found someone who took 12 hours to travel from Newport, Vt., near Canada, to Hooksett, N.H. Double yikes! After the eclipse, I am left to think about comfort and challenge and risk and reward. I hear that the two or three minutes of totality were amazing. The internet tells me there are 525,600 minutes in a year. Maybe something else will come along in 2024: a comet, a super blue moon, a new Jersey Mike’s. Next time I might carpe the diem. Oh, well. I appreciate the comfort and attractions of home. As I am writing this, a normally shy and secretive cardinal just landed on my deck outside the window right in front of me. It’s pleasant to watch it hop around. The sun is shining, bright as ever, and soon I will step outside to let its warm beams reach my face. There is a whole universe out there, and that’s a marvel too. Dan Mackie lives in West Lebanon.

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "text": "Posted On: Dec 28, 2023\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) customers can now leverage EC2 security groups to secure applications in clusters using Internet Protocol version 6(IPv6) address space.\nToday, EKS supports IPv6 enabling customers to scale containerized applications on Kubernetes beyond limits of private IPv4 address space. Kubernetes cluster administrators often have to operate in environments where IPv6 and IPv4 networks coexist. Until today, they could use network security rules that span pod to pod and pod to external Amazon Web Services service traffic defined in a single place with EC2 security groups, and applied to individual pods in IPv4 clusters. With this launch, customers can apply EC2 security groups for pods in both IPv4 and IPv6 clusters. Together with support for Amazon VPC CNI\nnetwork policies customers have an option for controlling network traffic within the cluster, while using security groups to control access to Amazon Web Services resources such as Amazon RDS outside the cluster.\nSupport for assigning security groups to IPv6 pods is available for most AWS Nitro based instances launched with new EKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.25 and above. To get started, visit the Amazon EKS\ndocumentation and blog.",
