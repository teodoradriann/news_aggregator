    "text": "The 9 Best Organic Women’s Multivamins On The Market\nThe Good Trade editors endorse products we’ve personally researched, tested, and genuinely love. Learn more about our methodology and business model here.\nWe’ve researched and tested dozens of doctor-recommended natural multivitamins — these are our top choices for their clean ingredients and gentle formulations.\nIt’s no surprise that our bodies’ needs rapidly change day to day, between our cycles, life stages, and age. So it’s hard to always get all the nutrition we need through our regular diets—and it’s even harder to find clean options that work for our lifestyles and preferences. But with a multivitamin, we can help close the gap in our nutrition and get the much-needed support our bodies need (think better gut health, immunity, hair and skin, and more).\nLuckily, there’s a growing number of women-focused multivitamin brands cropping up in the space, and they’re mostly made by women for women. Many of them are vegan or vegetarian-friendly, free of allergens and fillers, and are even fully traceable, so we always know what ends up in our bodies. (This is key, too, since the FDA doesn’t evaluate the safety of most multivitamins out there!)\nWhy do doctors recommend multivitamins for women?\nDoctors agree that adding a multivitamin to your daily routine can help women reach all the necessary nutrition requirements that can be tough to get based on diet, environment, and overall health needs. A multivitamin can help fill in any nutrient gaps and provide support where deficiencies may be occurring.\nWomen often have very specific nutrient requirements based on different stages of life. Iron deficiency is common, which can often be caused by heavy menstrual bleeding. Those who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant require additional folic acid to help support a fetus. Osteoporosis is a common condition in women, and higher doses of calcium and vitamin D can help support bone health. With all these possible scenarios and more, doctors may recommend women to take multivitamins to help supplement where necessary, in order to improve overall health and wellbeing.\nMultivitamins also help provide essential nutrients that are harder to get on a daily basis due to medications, diets, or medical conditions that can limit the appropriate amount of nutrition absorption from food. When we have the appropriate vitamin and mineral levels in our bodies, you will likely experience better energy levels, immune function, and skin and bone health.\nSo, what should you look for in a good multivitamin? According to Healthline, you’ll want a multivitamin that includes nutrients like vitamins B12 and D, calcium, magnesium, folate, iron, and zinc. The options below all have varying concentrations of these ingredients, so you’ll want to look at the serving in each dosage and ask your doctor to ensure they’re aligned with your current health needs.\nOur Criteria:\n- CLEAN INGREDIENTS | Each of these women’s multivitamins contains natural and organic ingredients, and are free of additives, synthetics, and fillers for the purest formulas around.\n- LICENSED DOCTOR RECOMMENDATIONS | We’ve prioritized multivitamin brands that are recommended by licensed doctors for their effectiveness and beneficial ingredients.\n- BIOAVAILABILITY & GENTLE FORMULATIONS FOR ABSORPTION | Each of these multivitamins contain bioavailable forms of vitamins and minerals. They are also easy on the stomach, for minimal adverse effects and maximum absorption.\nIf you require more specialized nutrition support, check out our roundups of our favorite natural magnesium supplements, fiber supplements, and prenatal vitamins so you can cover all your bases!\n**This review is not health advice. Please talk to your OBGYN or healthcare provider before adding any supplements to your diet.\nBest Overall | Best Prenatal | Most Affordable\n1. Ritual\nBest For | Various age groups (teens, 18+, post-menopause, prenatal, etc.)\nNatural & Organic Ingredients | Vegan, traceable ingredients, gluten- & allergen-free, free of colorants\nPrice | $33–$39/month; subscriptions available\nRitual isn’t just another DTC brand with great marketing (although, it’s that too!). It’s a wellness company that’s clinically backed by doctors, researchers, and scientists. We love the multivitamin options here because there are curated formulations for every life stage and gender, including kids and teenagers. The best-seller, the Essential For Women Multivitamin, has been clinically tested and is fully traceable for maximum efficacy and safety. What’s actually in it? There are nine nutrients, including 250% of your daily Vitamin D3, as well as 333% of your needed B12. There’s a hefty dose of iron (44%) that women also need, as well as vitamin E, magnesium, boron, and omega-3s. All the essentials in just two vegan capsules.\nRitual Review | “Outstanding quality, very easy on the stomach; my vitamin D levels have improved significantly since starting these vitamins. I would recommend 100%!” – Dionne C. [See all reviews]\n2. Perelel\nBest For | Overall health & skin\nNatural & Organic Ingredients | Gluten-free, soy-free, non-GMO, free of fillers\nPrice | $47/month; discounted subscriptions available (15% off)\nFounded by OB/GYNs and women’s health doctors, Perelel is one of the leading vitamin brands for women, including prenatals, PCOS support, and, yes, a daily supplement. The Women’s Daily Vitamin Trio supports you inside and out with three pills in a daily packet. It includes a multivitamin, an omega, and a collagen/biotin capsule for stronger hair, skin, and nails. The multivitamin touts all the major vitamins and nutrients like folate, zinc, and niacin, all blended together in a no-nausea formulation. (And a note: If you avoid fish, you won’t want to take the omega as it’s made with fish oil, but the rest is vegetarian-friendly). Stay in tip-top shape with these multivitamins from head to toe.\nPerelel Review | “My naturopath had never heard of this brand and he wanted to do a full assessment of the supplements I was taking to ensure they were doing good for me and adding value. After he reviewed the ingredients and consumption amounts, he was very impressed. In addition to it being effective, I love that it’s convenient to take with me if I’m out of the house or traveling AND another bonus is that the packaging and branding is beautiful.” – Berkeley L. https://perelelhealth.sjv.io/c/274622/1911933/22949?subId1=wel-web--&u=https%3A%2F%2Fperelelhealth.com%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-daily-vitamin-trio]\n3.

Mela Vitamins was founded by Ashley Harmon, an LA-based founder who was diagnosed with PCOS and a Vitamin D deficiency. During the discovery of her diagnosis, Harmon learned that 80% of melanated people are Vitamin D deficient and that melanin impacts how certain nutrients are produced in the body. Using this data and 10+ years of research, Mela was born and we couldn’t be more thrilled to include them in this list! As far as ingredients go, Mela is formulated with science-based nutrients (bioactive forms of essential vitamins A, C, D3, E, B6, B12), probiotics, and adaptogens (lion’s mane & Ceylon cinnamon) to support holistic wellness for melanated women. It’s also made in an FDA-registered facility is third-party tested, and the bottle is recyclable and non-toxic.\nMela Review | “I have tried so many vitamins, but this one truly works.

    "text": "Family Promise receives $1M Bezos grant to help Wake County's homeless families find permanent homes Family Promise of the Triangle, a Wake County organization serving families experiencing homelessness for 30 years, received a much-needed $1 million grant from the Bezos Day 1 Fund. The organization does not just offer families a temporary roof over their heads – they provide apartments, creating a semblance of normalcy and a path toward a brighter future. Lisa Owens and her six-year-old son moved into her apartment three weeks ago. It's the first stable housing they have had in a long time. \"It's been on and off since 2012, but his whole life has just been place to place, and we really never had our own space.\" Lisa Owens said. The Family Promise of the Triangle provides temporary shelter for families experiencing homelessness but it also has a transitional housing program that helps families create a future. \"There are requirements where they have to be employed; they have to put so much into an escrow account every month; they have to work with their case manager; they have budgeting skills; they attend life skills classes.\"Scott Ferris, Family Promise of the Triangle, said. Family Promise has turned a former student housing complex into 12 three-bedroom, three-bath apartments. It keeps things as normal as possible for families, especially children. \"A child that experiences homelessness is one to two years behind in school,\" Ferris said. \"They're more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, more likely to commit suicide.\" Ferris says they served 136 families across six programs last year, up from the previous year, and the need is just increasing. \"We have calls between 15 and 20 a day now, people requesting services,\" Ferris said.

    "title": "Galen Fries’s New Book, \"Up To Speed: A Preppers Guide,\" is a Thought-Provoking Exploration of How One Can Become Better Prepared for Any Kind of Disaster - PR.com",
    "text": "Tacoma, WA, June 24, 2024 --( PR.com )-- Fulton Books author Galen Fries, a retired sergeant first class who served for thirty years in both the active-duty Army and the Army National Guard, as well as a certified military instructor and a certified wildland firefighter, has completed his most recent book, “Up To Speed: A Preppers Guide”: a thorough discussion about the proper steps one should take in order to be ready for disasters, man-made or otherwise.\nAn avid hiker, shooter, motorcycle rider, and boater, author Galen Fries has spent a lifetime outside building a healthy respect for nature. Having a family consisting of a wife, three kids, three step kids, and multiple grandchildren, he feels his family is an extremely important part of his life. Although Galen doesn’t consider himself a survivalist, when his military unit took the Y2K threat to the infrastructure seriously, he recognized the importance of preparing oneself and one’s family for undesirable situations. Having had countless conversations with friends, coworkers, and loved ones about being ready for unexpected and undesirable events, he decided to finally write it all down, hence “Up to Speed: A Prepper’s Guide.”\n“The book has been carefully broken up into levels of importance,” writes Fries. “It begins by addressing a survival mindset. It then goes on to discuss ways we can set ourselves up for success when it to comes to reuniting with loved ones, having a home to come home to, and finally what we should consider as we step out of our homes in order to keep our families safe. ‘Up to Speed’ tries to take the daunting task of protecting what is truly important to us and break it down into small manageable pieces.\n“This is not a survivalist book. This is just a discussion and shouldn’t be considered the end-all in preppers’ manuals. In it you will find references to many other books that will supplement your preparedness library.”\nPublished by Fulton Books, Galen Fries’s book will help readers become more informed about potential disasters, as well as guide them towards examining their own personal preparedness, from their minds and bodies to supplies and their homes. Drawing upon the author’s years of personal observations and experiences, “Up To Speed: A Preppers Guide” is a must-have for any prepper’s tool kit.\nReaders who wish to experience this engaging work can purchase “Up To Speed: A Preppers Guide” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play, or Barnes and Noble.\nPlease direct all media inquiries to Author Support via email at support@fultonbooks.com or via telephone at 877-210-0816.",

    "title": "China's Li Hui Spearheads Ukraine Peace Efforts, Proposes International Conference",
    "text": "In a significant diplomatic endeavor, Chinese diplomat Li Hui has been at the forefront of mediating efforts in the Ukraine conflict, engaging with key European capitals and Ukrainian officials. Amidst the ongoing turmoil, Li's mission represents a beacon of hope for a potential resolution, leveraging China's influence to propose a peace conference recognized by both Russia and Ukraine.\nAdvertisment Shuttle Diplomacy in Action Li Hui's diplomatic tour has taken him across various European nations, including significant talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and European diplomats. The essence of Li's mission has been to convey information, foster consensus, and underscore the urgency of convening a peace conference for a ceasefire. This initiative comes at a critical time when the international community seeks to avoid further escalation in the conflict, emphasizing the mutual interests of all parties involved, including China and Germany.\nChina's Mediation Role Welcomed Advertisment The response to China's mediation efforts, led by Li Hui, has been overwhelmingly positive. Key players in the Ukrainian issue have expressed their gratitude towards China for its proactive role in seeking a peaceful resolution. Germany , in particular, has lauded China's active involvement, signaling a willingness to collaborate closely with Beijing. This international endorsement underscores the potential impact of China's diplomatic engagement, setting the stage for a broader peace process.\nTowards a Peace Conference At the heart of Li Hui's diplomatic engagement is the proposition of a peace conference that involves all relevant parties on an equal footing. This approach not only aims to facilitate a ceasefire but also to lay the groundwork for a lasting resolution to the conflict. The emphasis on equal participation reflects China's commitment to a balanced and fair process, ensuring that the voices of all stakeholders are heard. As the international community awaits the realization of this conference, the anticipation grows for a possible breakthrough in the Ukraine crisis.\nThe endeavors of Li Hui and the Chinese diplomatic machinery illustrate a significant shift towards active engagement in global conflict resolution. As discussions continue and plans for a peace conference take shape, the world watches closely, hopeful for a peaceful outcome that could not only end the current hostilities but also pave the way for a more stable and harmonious international order.",
