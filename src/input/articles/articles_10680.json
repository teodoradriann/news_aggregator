    "text": "VISAKHAPATNAM: Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has asserted that he is committed to strengthening Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP).\nSpeaking at Darlapudi in Anakapalle district after inspecting the Polavaram Left Canal works on Thursday, he said they have kept all options open to protect the steel plant. Without referring to the YSRC, Naidu said, “A political party is spreading canards that I have agreed to privatisation of the steel plant. VSP is a symbol of self-respect of Telugu people. We have fought against privatisation of the plant when such proposal was made earlier, and we also brought financial assistance from the Centre for the plant development. It is our responsibility to protect the plant.’’\nLaunching a tirade against the Opposition leaders, Naidu alleged that hardcore economic offenders had exploited Visakhapatnam, and such people would not be spared. “Three sugar factories in the cooperative sector have been closed down because of the inefficiency of the previous regime,” he observed.\nOn the irrigation sector, the Chief Minister asserted that every acre of land in North Coastal Andhra can be provided water if the Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi project is completed. In Anakapalle district alone, 2.80 lakh acres can be provided irrigation water, and the drinking water problem can also be resolved. The previous YSRC regime failed to take forward the Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi project, he deplored.\nThe Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi right canal works to the tune of 214 km need to be completed. In the first phase, `800 has to be spent on completing 93 km length of canal works to provide irrigation water to one lakh acres in Anakapalle district, Naidu said, and announced that tenders will be invited soon.\nLater, Naidu inspected the progress of Bhogapuram Greenfield Airport in Vizianagaram district. He said the airport will play a major role in development of North Coastal Andhra, and the project will be completed by June 2026. “Bhogapuram will turn into a economic hub,” he averred.\nUnder Phase 1, a road will also be laid from Bhogapuram to Beach Road, another 50 km road connecting Srikakulam and the airport will be taken up in the second phase. Similarly, in the third phase, road connectivity will be provided to Mulapeta port, he explained.\n“We are also planning to construct more airports in the State. The new airports have been proposed at Kuppam, Dagadarthi, Nagarjunasagar and Mulapet,” he revealed.",

    "title": "The Future of Renewable Energy: Transparent Spectral Converters Enhance Solar Cell Efficiency",
    "text": "The protective material transforms harmful ultraviolet photons into visible light, increasing the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices.\nOver the past decade, photovoltaic cells (PCs) have garnered much attention worldwide as promising sources of renewable energy. However, PCs still have not achieved light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies high enough to gain widespread adoption, and scientists are on the lookout for new materials and designs with better performance.\nLimitations of Current Photovoltaic Technologies\nTwo of the most actively studied types of PCs are perovskite PCs and amorphous-silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) PCs, each with their own set of limitations. Perovskite PCs suffer from two major setbacks: first, even though solar radiation covers wavelengths that go from near-infrared all the way up to ultraviolet (UV) light, perovskite PCs use only a small portion of this spectrum, leading to low energy conversion efficiency. Second, they are vulnerable to photo-degradation from exposure to high-intensity UV light. In contrast, a-SiC:H PCs cannot effectively harvest UV light owing to a mismatch between the spectral profile of sunlight and the spectral response of a-SiC:H materials.\nInnovative Spectral Converter Layer\nBut what if these problems could be solved simply by applying a special transparent layer on top of the PC? In a recent study published in the Journal of Photonics for Energy, a research team including Dr. Pei Song from Shanghai University of Engineering Science, China, developed a novel solar spectral converter using a GdPO4 glass-ceramic (GC) material doped with praseodymium (Pr) and europium (Eu) ions. This technology could lead to notable boosts in performance and applicability in solar cells.\nMechanism and Benefits of the New Converter Layer\nThe main purpose of GdPO4-GC:Eu3+/Pr3+ is to absorb UV photons from solar radiation and re-emit them as visible light. This is possible thanks to the efficient energy transfer that happens between the ions in the material. When a UV photon hits a Pr3+ ion, it generates an excited electronic state. This accumulated energy has a high chance of being transferred to a Gd3+ ion, which releases some of it before transferring the rest to an Eu3+ ion. As a result, excited electronic states in the Eu3+ ion undergo a down transition to lower energy states, emitting visible light.\nSeveral experiments confirmed that the Gd3+ ions act as bridges between Pr3+ and Eu3+ ions in these energy transitions. Thus, a thin transparent GdPO4-GC:Eu3+/Pr3+ layer applied onto a PC not only shields it from UV photons but also feeds it additional light. Additionally, this protective effect helps prevent photo-degradation in perovskite PCs. Meanwhile, in both perovskite and a-SiC:H PCs, the spectral conversion layer helps the overall system use energy from solar radiation more efficiently by making it “sensitive” to UV photons, which would otherwise be wasted.\nPotential Applications and Future Research\nNotably, the proposed GdPO4-GC:Eu3+/Pr3+ material is straightforward to synthesize via a conventional melting quenching process. Moreover, since the material is also remarkably stable, it appears promising as a protective layer for space-borne PCs, such as those used in space stations. “Nowadays, expanding space stations require more power support and need high-performance PCs. By covering the top side of a PC with the proposed spectral conversion material and using appropriate encapsulation and sealing technology, we can ensure very low humidity levels and efficient UV recycling,” explains Song. “In addition, GC materials have a hard texture, so they can protect PCs from being hit by tiny floating debris in space.”\nMore studies will be needed to further improve the efficiency of PCs using doped GC materials as spectral converters. The researchers note that future work could focus on improving cost-effectiveness by adjusting doping concentrations and optimizing the thickness of the protective layer.\nA Step Towards Sustainable Solar Energy\n“With potential applications in both terrestrial and space PCs, the development of spectral downshifting Pr3+/Eu3+ co-doped glass-ceramics might open up new avenues to achieve better performance in photovoltaic devices,” concludes Song.\nLet us hope that solar energy will grow to become not only an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels but also the energy source of the future!\nReference: “Ultraviolet-wavelength driven solar spectral converter for photovoltaic cell application” by Pei Song, Chaomin Zhang and Pengfei Zhu, 23 December 2023, Journal of Photonics for Energy.\nDOI: 10.1117/1.JPE.14.015501",

A organização está agora em nove estruturas de saúde do enclave palestiniano. \"Queríamos estar em muitas mais\", assumiu o responsável.\nSobre a deterioração das condições humanitárias em Gaza, João Antunes destaca a eclosão de doenças como a polio, difteria ou o sarampo, mas também a desnutrição.\nSão as \"mortes silenciosas\" que não se contabilizam diretamente como vítimas deste conflito, frisou.

    "title": "Kratos & RAFAEL Establish Prometheus Energetics Joint Venture, a U.S.-Based Merchant Supplier of Solid Rocket Motors",
    "text": "From Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.\nSAN DIEGO, February 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: KTOS), a technology company in the defense, national security and global markets, and RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., today announced an approximate 50/50 partnership for the establishment of a U.S.-based merchant supplier of solid rocket motors (SRMs) and other energetics. The new joint venture, named Prometheus Energetics (“Prometheus”), is set to be headquartered on an approximate 500-acre site near the United States Navy and Army facility in Crane, Indiana.\nKratos and RAFAEL (through its U.S. based subsidiary RAFAEL USA) have jointly committed up to $175 million in capital for the establishment of Prometheus and required property, plant, equipment and personnel needed for the new, state-of-the-art energetics manufacturing campus and facilities. After construction of the plant and once RAFAEL’s technology transfer is completed and certified for operations, Prometheus is projected to begin production in 2027 of SRMs.\nEric DeMarco, President and CEO of Kratos Defense, said, “We believe Prometheus, once up and running at full rate production, will be a step function catalyst in value creation for Kratos’ stakeholders and the U.S. defense industrial base, similar to Kratos’ recent MACH-TB contract award—the largest single-award contract in Kratos history. Like other major Kratos investments such as Oriole, Zeus, and Erinyes, Prometheus responds to a critical need to strengthen the U.S. Industrial Base and will also provide tens of thousands of SRMs and casted warheads supporting both America’s most reliable partner in the Middle East and United States national security related demand from a true SRM and energetics merchant supplier.”\nYoav Tourgeman, President and CEO of RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., said:\n“The establishment of Prometheus Energetics is a strategic leap forward, reinforcing RAFAEL’s commitment to strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base while ensuring our allies and partners have access to the most advanced, combat-proven energetics solutions. This step constitutes a strategic vector that combines business considerations in the American market with the increasing demand for energetic products, while significantly enhancing our ability to deliver resilient and reliable supply solutions to our customers. Through this joint venture, we are deepening our longstanding partnership with the United States, strengthening supply chain independence, and bolstering the critical capabilities needed to address evolving national security challenges.”",

    "text": "United National Party’s (UNP’s) Colombo District Manager and Working Committee Member Lasantha Gunawardena said that every time the country collapsed, the UNP had had taken on the responsibility to save it and this time President Ranil Wickremesinghe would save the bankrupt country. Gunawardena said this while joining the press conference held on Wednesday (28) at Sirikotha, the UNP headquarters. He further expressed the following views: “When President Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country in 2022, there was no money in the Treasury. There were long queues for petroleum and gas. Examinations could not be conducted. The farmers were destitute and they could not find a bundle of fertilizer even for Rs. 30,000. The dollar shot up to Rs. 400. Migrant workers did not send money to the country. No tourists came. The power cuts increased to 14 hours. It was a time when we had no way to pay for the oil tanker that anchored at the port. “Today, the Central Bank’s dollar reserves have been increased to US$ 4 billion. Today there are no gas queues, no oil queues. Schools are functioning on time and exams are being held. Children get more benefits including the Suraksha health insurance. Rs.113 billion was allocated from the Budget to increase salaries and pensions. Government employees’ allowances have been increased by Rs. 10,000. Also, the dollar, which was said to rise to Rs. 500, has been contained at Rs. 335 upper ceiling. “A sum of Rs. 207 billion was allocated for Aswesuma welfare benefits. A programme to grant land rights to people will begin in January. People get more value for their land accordingly. Urban residents are given ownership of their homes. It should be remembered that if the children had received tab computers, it would have been of great assistance during the Covid pandemic. “As a leader who thinks about the future, it should be noted that President Wickremesinghe’s allocation of money from this Budget for Artificial Intelligence is very important. Also, the bank interest which was 28 percent has been brought down to 12 percent. Through the Central Bank Act, a system has been created where money printing is limited. Inflation which was at 70 percent has been brought down to 3 percent.”",
