    "text": "Is Yoga An Evil Occult Ritual Disguised As Exercise?\nThis page is more than five years old.\nAcross the globe and at every waking hour, millions of people are practicing the ancient disciplines of Yoga which date back to before the 2nd Century. Although Yoga has been traced back more than 3,000 years as an ancient Hindu tradition, it has changed very little in the intervening years as a method of relaxation, calming anxiety and helping people obtain health and happiness.\nAs ancient as it is, Yoga was actually only introduced to The West by NC Paul, an Indian physician in the mid 1800s. He had studied the beneficial effects of Yoga on the mind and soul, writing a paper on the subject which paved the way for fellow Indian Hindu Swami Vivekananda's tour of Europe and The United States advocating Yoga and teaching its fundamentals.\nBut what is Yoga exactly? The word itself can be represented in English by 'union' or 'yoke' and has 12 basic body poses or postures which are used in combination with slow and deliberate inhaling, stretching, twisting and exhaling as a form of low-impact exercise.\nBut Yoga isn't loved by everyone. In the 1960's there was some paranoia about Yoga being aligned with religious cults, counter-cultures and Western 'mystery traditions' which tied spiritualism with the occult. The 1980's was a boom time for Yoga; video tapes and TV shows dedicated themselves to promoting Yoga's tremendous health benefits for hearts, spines and general wellness but as Yoga grew so did its opponents. For every article, book, vinyl record or VHS tape showing how Yoga was spiritually enhancing and an exercise for both body and mind, there were organised groups convinced that Yoga was a very bad thing. It doesn’t help change their opinion either that some yoga practitioners use yoni eggs while doing the various poses, adding a sexual connotation to the practice as well. We visited\nYonieggs.coto research these and their blog mentioned that they were used in ancient Eastern cultures by aristocrats and royal concubines to improve their sexual chakra. But all this talk of chakra doesn’t align with the beliefs of religions like Islam and Christianity.\nSome Christian groups disapproved of Yoga believing it was aligned to New Age practices like meditation. As recently as 2003, The Vatican warned that such practices “could lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations”.\nMeanwhile, Islam banned Yoga outright in fear it would introduce Hinduism into their religion, as did some Christian groups worried that Yoga would blur their religious boundaries and somehow sully their relationship with their God.\nAlthough many Christian churches hold Yoga classes, others find Yoga 'un-Christian' and evil. They believe Yoga is the work of Satan, like Pagan rituals, infant sacrifice and the worship of alternative gods and goddesses. According to Hinduism, Bhairavi is the goddess of Kundalini, whose spirit is a coiled energy in everyone's spine waiting for its awakening – a thing which horrifies Christians, reasoning that releasing the Kundalini spirit is so spiritually dangerous that they issue warnings about its links with Yoga, meditation and mysticism being a 'way in' for The Devil and fake gods.\nHardcore Christians believe that Satan tricks us into thinking Yoga is a good thing but by harnessing all your energy created during the poses, you are inviting demons into your body and eventually the false gods and goddesses like Shakti and Bhairavi will align with the demonic and use your body as a portal for even more demons to enter you, destroying your Christianity, making you sick and ultimately causing your premature death. They say Shakti is such a big part of the Devil, you will soon turn your dark thoughts into reality and Satan will take you over … without you even knowing. Once you have lost your 'one-ness' and allowed demons and alter-demons to take control of your soul, you are handing over blood-rights of your unborn to Satan.\nSo, next time you feel like striking 'The Butterfly' or 'Cat-Cow' pose on your rubber mat, remember that the future generations are relying on you not to channel too much energy in one direction since your inner 'Baby Cobra' and 'Diving Swan' could awaken your Kundalini Spirit at any time!\nComments\nWant To Join The Conversation?\nSign in or create an account to leave a comment.\nYour comment has been submitted and is awaiting moderation.\nBe the first to comment.\nSee More Discussions\nLearn With Higgypop\nHosted by Paralearning in association with Higgypop, these courses on ghost hunting, paranormal investigations, and occult practices draw on the experience of our team of paranormal writers.\nDiploma In Advanced Scientific Theory For Paranormal Investigators\nThis course gives you practical and useful knowledge of ghost hunting and paranormal research, which is invaluable when conducting your own paranormal investigations or as part of a group event.\nView Course\nDiploma In Practical Ghost Hunting & Scientific Analysis\nThis course gives you practical and useful knowledge of ghost hunting and paranormal research, which is invaluable when conducting your own paranormal investigations or as part of a group event.\nView Course\nMore Like This\nMoviesFebruary 14, 2025\nPaul Giamatti To Play Paranormal Radio Host Art Bell In New Biopic Movie\nRadioFebruary 13, 2025\nParanormal Tales From The World Of Radio\nRadioFebruary 13, 2025",

    "text": "[Biden-Harris Deep Fake Administration](/Subjects/00774-LAST-biden-harris-deep-fake-administration.htm) • https://joepags.com, By Joe Pags Staff [BIDEN'S DOJ SEND OUT MEMO TO JUDGES ASKING TO LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS ON ILLEGAL...](https://joepags.com/news/bidens-doj-send-out-memo-to-judges-asking-to-loosen-restrictions-on-illegal-migrants-under-21/) Biden's Department of Justice sent out a recent memo asking immigration judges to \"treat cases involving migrants under the age of 21 as part of a child docket that loosens restrictions on court absences\" reports the Daily Caller News Foundation. The memo, which was issued December 21st, directs judges to handle cases involving migrants below the age of 21 with less scrutiny and give them second chances if they fail to show up to their court appearances as part of a new \"juvenile docket\". The department and proponents say the creation of a juvenile docket will help address mounting concerns of human trafficking involving children entering the country illegally, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \"Juvenile points of contact will be trained to recognize common indicators of these crimes in order to seek engagement by our ICE colleagues to provide protection and support to these children when needed, while ensuring fair adjudication of their cases before the court. This new initiative is for the well-being of children throughout their immigration proceedings,\" ICE Principal Legal Advisor Kerry E. Doyle said in a statement regarding the program. In cases where a child shows signs that they're a victim of trafficking, abuse and neglect, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) \"may\" open a probe into the matter, according to the memo. Critics, however, say this is a Biden administration ruse. \"The administration gives the impression it is concerned about the interests of children in our immigration system, mandating, for example, that ICE attorneys 'will' request a 30-day continuance when children fail to appear in court. But I notice that in the same document, the administration writes only that DHS and HHS 'may' initiate investigations into potential trafficking, abuse, or neglect,\" former ICE Chief of Staff under the Trump administration Jon Feere, who now serves as the director of investigations for the Center for Immigration Studies, told the DCNF.",

    "text": "Em entrevista à CH, a dupla voltou no tempo ao relembrar trilhas sonoras de momentos especiais É normal ouvir uma música e lembrar de determinado momento ou pessoa, não é? No caso de Evidências do Amor, a clássica canção Evidências leva o personagem de Fábio Porchat ao passado, literalmente, por ser a trilha sonora do ex relacionamento dele com a protagonista de Sandy. Em entrevista à CH, os atores aproveitaram para recordar trilhas que foram especiais em suas vidas e também quais músicas mais gostam de tocar no karaokê. Confira a entrevista completa: Além de Fábio e Sandy, o elenco ainda conta com nomes como Evelyn Castro e Larissa Luz enquanto o roteiro é assinado por Luanna Guimarães, Alvaro Campos e o próprio Porchat. Já Pedro Antonio comandou a direção do longa que acompanha a história de Marco e Laura. Eles se conhecem em uma noite de karaokê ao cantarem Evidências juntos e começam a namorar. Só que, quando as coisas terminam, algo estranho acontece sempre que Marco ouve a canção. Confira a sinopse oficial: “Em uma noite qualquer, Marco e Laura se conhecem em um karaokê e cantam juntos a música Evidências. Desde então, eles se apaixonaram e formaram um casal que parecia perfeito, até o momento do ‘sim’. Sem entender o que aconteceu, agora, toda vez que essa música toca, Marco viaja em suas lembranças com Laura para encarar as Evidências Do Amor.“ Evidências do Amor está em cartaz nos cinemas brasileiros.",

    "title": "Bright Ideas: How Solar Panels and Grid Systems Power Our World",
    "text": "Solar energy is like a superhero for our planet. It’s clean, endless, and comes from the sun, lighting up our world every day. First off, let’s explore how we capture this light and turn it into power for our homes, schools, and even our toys. Solar panels, those shiny boards you see on rooftops, play a big part in this adventure. They grab sunlight and change it into electricity. Now, imagine if we could do this really well, using less space but creating more power. That’s what we mean by “\nsolar panel efficiency“. It’s like being the best at a video game; the better you are, the more points you score.\nUnderstanding Solar Panel Efficiency\nSolar panels are like leaves, soaking up sunlight. The better they are at catching sunlight and turning it into electricity, the more efficient they are. Imagine a game where the goal is to capture as many sunlight points as possible. Some players (solar panels) are better at the game, catching more points with less effort. These are considered more efficient. Efficiency is key because it means we need fewer panels to power up things like homes, schools, or even your favorite video game console. Plus, efficient panels can save space and money, making solar energy a smart choice for our planet.\nThe Magic Behind Grid-tied Solar Systems\nGrid-tied solar systems connect solar-powered homes to the city’s electricity grid. It’s like having a team where solar panels and the power company work together. When your panels catch too much sunlight, the extra power can be shared with others through the grid. This teamwork helps lower electricity bills and keeps the lights on even when the sun isn’t shining. It’s a win-win: you save money, and the planet gets a little cleaner.\nHow Grid-Tied Systems Manage Electricity\nGrid-tied systems are like smart lemonade stands for your home. They use a special meter that keeps track of the electricity your solar panels make and how much of it you use. When your panels make more electricity than you need, the extra goes back to the big electricity “store” – the grid. This meter can see electricity moving two ways: into your home when you need it, and out to the grid when you have extra.\nThis smart system helps the environment too. It’s like choosing to make lemonade with organic, locally-sourced lemons and sugar. By using solar energy, we make less pollution and help keep our planet clean. Plus, the more we share our “homemade electricity,” the less we need to rely on big power plants that can harm the earth.\nStoring Sunshine: Solar Energy Storage Solutions\nSolar energy storage solutions are like big batteries that save sunlight for later. When the sun goes down or on cloudy days, these batteries kick in, powering your home with sunshine saved from earlier. It’s like having a savings account, but instead of money, you’re saving rays of sunlight. This way, you can still play video games or read by lamp light, thanks to the sun’s power, anytime you need it.\nSharing is Caring: How Solar Energy Gets Around\nSharing excess solar energy back to the grid is like lending a helping hand. With net metering, when your solar panels catch more sunlight than you need, you can send it back to the grid. It’s as if you’re helping to light up your neighbor’s home with your extra sunshine. This not only supports your community but also earns you credits, reducing your electricity bill even more. Sharing solar energy makes our electricity grid healthier and our planet happier.\nThe Bright Future of Solar Technology\nThe future of solar technology shines bright with new advancements. Scientists and engineers are working hard to make solar panels even more efficient and batteries better at storing energy. This means we’ll be able to catch and keep more sunlight than ever before, powering more things with clean energy. Imagine a world where almost everything runs on sunlight, from cars to entire cities. That’s the future we’re heading towards, making the planet safer and cleaner for everyone.\nMaximizing the Benefits of Solar Panels and Grid-Tied Systems\nGetting the most out of your solar panels is like having the best recipe for your lemonade stand.\n- First, make sure your solar panels are in the sunniest spot. Just like you’d set up your lemonade stand where the most people walk by, placing your panels where they get a lot of sun means more power for your home.\n- Keep your solar panels clean, too. Imagine if your lemonade glasses were dirty; not many friends would want to drink from them. In the same way, clean solar panels can catch more sunlight and make more electricity.\n- Think about when you use your homemade electricity. Using it during the day means you can use the power as soon as your panels make it. It’s like drinking your lemonade fresh, right after you’ve made it, for the best taste.\n- Lastly, talk to someone who knows a lot about solar panels, like a local solar company. They can give you tips, just like a master lemonade maker can help you make your stand the best in the neighborhood. They might even help you find more ways to make your solar panels work better for you and the planet.\nSummary\nIn wrapping up, solar panel efficiency and grid-tied systems are like superheroes for our planet. They work together to make the most of the sun’s power, helping to light up our homes and lives while protecting the environment. With advancements on the horizon, the future looks even brighter. As we embrace solar energy, we’re not just saving money; we’re also taking steps towards a cleaner, greener world. Remember, every ray of sunlight we capture and use is a step forward in lighting up a path towards a better future for all of us.",

    "text": "Revelan datos del Ministerio de Trabajo y Seguridad Social\nMientras que en 2019 el departamento de Inspección de Trabajo del Ministerio de Trabajo y Seguridad Social (MTSS) atendió casos en 196 empresas por el no pago o pago incompleto del aguinaldo, para 2023 las denuncias aumentaron hasta 375. Esto significa un incremento del 91%.\nPor otra parte, las personas afectadas también pasaron de 589 (2022) a 1.986 de un año a otro. El 2023 es el año que registra mayor cantidad de denuncias y de personas afectadas desde 2018.\nTambién es cierto que es el periodo en que menos casos se elevaron a juicio, ya que muchas de las prevenciones fueron atendidas por los patronos.\nAsí lo confirmó Trabajo en la presentación de la campaña “Aguinaldo completo y a tiempo”.\nAndrés Romero, titular de esa cartera, manifestó: “El Ministerio de Trabajo va a estar en distintos puntos del país a través de todos los informativos en la página web en redes sociales, en medios de comunicación, informando sobre la importancia de pagar el aguinaldo a tiempo”.\nSectores donde más denuncian\nComercio es el sector en que más casos se reportaron el año pasado. Los comerciantes recibieron 209 de las 375 denuncias en total. Por su parte, servicios recibió 76, construcción 20, industria 14 y agro 11.\nPor regiones, donde más denuncias se registraron están el Valle Central con 253, Zona Norte con 43, Limón 25, Guanacaste 21, Puntarenas 18 y Zona Sur 15.\nConozca más sobre el aguinaldo\nRomero informó que el aguinaldo debe ser pagado por el patrono entre el 1 y el 20 de diciembre, de manera completa y en un solo tracto.\nPor su parte, Alexander Astorga, viceministro de Trabajo, recordó que este derecho solo aplica para personas que tienen una relación laboral y quedan por fuera quienes se hallan en regímenes como servicios profesionales y otros.\nLa campaña del Ministerio de Trabajo tiene dos fases, la primera es preventiva e informativa. Los inspectores del 1 al 20 de diciembre estarán en nueve toldos informativos en todo el país.\nAclararán dudas a trabajadores y patronos sobre cómo deben actuar para que se haga efectivo el pago.\nTambién se desarrollarán campañas en redes sociales, sitios web y medios de comunicación sobre los derechos y obligaciones de las partes en relación con el aguinaldo.\nA partir del 21 de diciembre los inspectores pasan a la fase reactiva de la campaña. Cuando la empresa no cumple y no lo paga, los trabajadores tendrán derecho a denunciar.\nPara demandar, solo se debe identificar la empresa y su dirección. Los inspectores harán las visitas respectivas, aunque el ministerio también recibe denuncias anónimas.\nManuel Rojas\n“Yo trabajaba para una empresa constructora y no me pagaron el aguinaldo, tuve que ir a poner la denuncia. Eso pasó hace 10 años y tuvimos que irnos a juicio”.\nFederico Herrán\n“Yo pasé por eso, trabajaba en un taller y me despidieron. Tuve que ir al Ministerio de Trabajo y ellos me indicaron cuánto tenía que cobrar de prestaciones y aguinaldo”.",

    "text": "RPT-Cyclone Alfred stalls off Australia's east, residents sandbag homes, transport, schools shut\nCyclone Alfred stalled off Australia's east coast on Thursday delaying landfall as officials shut airports, schools and public transport and residents stockpiled supplies and sandbagged homes against floodwaters expected when the category-two storm hits.\nCyclone Alfred stalled off Australia's east coast on Thursday delaying landfall as officials shut airports, schools and public transport and residents stockpiled supplies and sandbagged homes against floodwaters expected when the category-two storm hits. The storm is now expected to make landfall by Friday evening near Brisbane, Australia's third-most populous city, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its latest update, compared with a prior projection of a landfall by early Friday.\nBut the storm's destructive reach will stretch across the border regions of the states of Queensland and New South Wales, bringing heavy rain, flooding and damaging winds. \"It has slowed up somewhat, that (landfall) will now be at a later time,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.\n\"That is not all good news. The risk is that in slowing up, (the cyclone) increases in its intensity but at this stage it is still predicted to be category two as it crosses onto land.\" Storm warnings on Thursday stretched for more than 500 kms (311 miles) across the northeast coast, as giant seas whipped up by the cyclone eroded beaches, and officials urged residents in flood-prone areas to evacuate soon.\nCyclone Alfred stalled off the coast overnight, said Dean Narramore, forecaster at Australia's weather bureau. Narramore said the stalling could result in \"a longer and prolonged period of heavy rainfall, particularly in northern New South Wales\" leading to life-threatening flash flooding.\nHeavy rain from the weather system has already drenched some regions before the cyclone's landfall, Narramore said. Sara Robertson and her family has moved all their valuables from their home in the rural town of Murwillumbah to a motel ahead of the storm.\n\"I'm glad we've got a little bit more of a breather, feeling very tired today and we still have a lot to do,\" Robertson told ABC News after moving computers and electronics into the motel. About 4,000 properties in the rural town of Lennox Head, about 750 kms (466 miles) north of Sydney, are without power after snapped tree branches fell on power lines, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told ABC News.\nQantas and Virgin Australia\nAlfred has been called by officials a 'very rare event' for Brisbane, Queensland's state capital, with the city last hit by a cyclone more than half a century ago in 1974. The city of around 2.7 million had near misses from cyclones in 1990 in 2019.\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",
