    "title": "'It is historic': US poised to see record drop in yearly homicides despite public concern over crime",
    "text": "The year is expected to end with over 2,000 fewer murders than in 2022.\nWith 2023 ticking down, the nation is poised to finish the year with its biggest annual drop in homicides on record, according to preliminary data from law enforcement agencies both large and small.\nThe homicide rate in the United States is expected to plummet nearly 13% compared to 2022, meaning more than 2,000 fewer people were the victims of homicide this year, Jeff Asher, a national crime analyst, told ABC News.\nThe drop in homicides comes as more than three-quarters of Americans say there is more crime in the U.S. than a year ago and more than half of Americans say the same about crime in their local area, according to a Gallup poll released last month. Adding to that perception is the annual National Crime Victimization Survey published this month by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics that found the number of violent crime victims nationwide climbed from 16.5 per 1,000 people in 2021 to 23.5 per 1,000 in 2022.\nCities say the 2023 drop in homicides and other violent crimes can be attributed to expanded efforts to prevent crime, including working with community volunteers, targeting gun possession in high-crime areas and placing officers on foot and bike patrols.\n\"It is historic. It's the largest one-year decline,\" said Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former crime analyst for the CIA and the New Orleans Police Department. \"It's cities of every size, it's the suburbs, it's rural counties, tiny cities, it's large cities. It's really a national decline.\"\nAsher said his analysis is based on available preliminary crime data provided by 180 law enforcement agencies.\nHe said before this year, the largest year-over-year drop in homicides occurred in 1996 when murders fell by 9%.\nAn ABC News review of preliminary crime data from the 10 largest U.S. cities shows that heading into the last week of the year, seven of the municipalities have seen double-digit year-over-year declines in 2023 homicides -- including an 11% drop in New York City, a 16% decrease in Los Angeles, and a 13% reduction in Chicago.\nHouston, the country's fourth largest city, saw its homicide numbers fall by 11% and homicides in Philadelphia, the nation's sixth biggest city, have fallen by 21%, according to the preliminary data.\nThe challenge faced by local law enforcement to bring down the country's homicide numbers for the second consecutive year following a record jump in 2020 and a sizable increase in 2021, was achieved this year with a major assist from the U.S. Justice Department and bipartisan gun-control legislation passed by Congress, officials said.\n\"We're seeing double-digit declines in homicide across nearly 70 of America's largest cities,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in an exclusive interview with ABC News chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas, citing information from the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\nMonaco said the federal government has played the role of \"force multiplier\" in helping local law enforcement drive down the nation's murder rate by identifying and removing the most prolific shooters and violent offenders from the streets.\n\"Something that we are doing is using new authorities from the most significant gun safety law that has passed in 30 years ... the bipartisan Safer Communities Act that passed last year. And with that tool, we've charged more than 300 defendants with new gun trafficking and illegal trafficking,\" Monaco told ABC News. \"We're using tools like crime-gun intelligence, the ability to trace the gun and the spent shell casing from a crime scene to identify who's that shooter, how many violent crimes have they been involved with.\"\nSmaller cities are also seeing dramatic decreases in homicides. New Orleans, which had the highest murder rate in the nation in 2022, has seen a 25% drop in homicides in 2023. Baltimore's homicide numbers have fallen by 25%, Atlanta's by 18%, and Miami's by 15%.\nBut not all cities have seen homicides fall. As of Dec. 26, Washington, D.C., has seen its homicides jump 36% and Dallas has seen a 14% increase. In Memphis, Tennessee, homicides rose 31% through the first six months of the year, the most recent data available.\n\"But those cities are especially notable because they are outliers this year, not the norm,\" Asher said.\nOne of the largest drops in homicides occurred in Detroit, which as of Dec. 26 has seen murders fall by 18% since last year, according to the police department's preliminary data.\n\"We're looking at some numbers that we haven't seen in close to 60 years in the city of Detroit,\" Detroit Police Chief James White told ABC News. \"But we're stopping short of celebrating because certainly we still have a lot of work to do.\"\nFollowing a rash of shootings in downtown Detroit in April, White immediately instituted a 12-point crimefighting program normally reserved for the hot summer months, he said.\n\"That involved just really having officers on foot patrol, bike patrol, engaging our community in a very positive way,\" said White.\nHe said the city, led by Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Wayne County prosecutor, has helped pave the way for an overall reduction in crime by boosting the number of police officers from 2,331 in 2022 to 2,486 in 2023 and giving cops a substantial pay raise. White said his department has been approved to hire another 200 officers in the coming year.\nLike other chiefs interviewed by ABC News, White attributed a large part of Detroit's crime turnaround to winning back the public's trust following widespread protests and calls for defunding police departments in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in 2020. White said the city forged relationships with \"community violence interrupters,\" civilians who work in the streets to help the police department pinpoint problem areas and solve crimes.\n\"They're sick and tired of the senseless, violent crime and they're cooperating. They're telling us where the problems are, and it's our responsibility to address them quickly and keep working to keep those relationships strong in the community,\" White said about community violence interrupters.\nThe result, he said, has been 55 fewer homicides in the city compared to this time last year.\n\"That's 55 lives, 55 people, 55 mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters that don't have to bury a loved one,\" White said.\nWhite also noted that there have been 135 fewer non-fatal shootings in Detroit compared to last year.\n\"So if half of those had resulted in homicide, you can clearly see what the numbers would be, and the victimization that would have occurred, the families that would be impacted. But the fact that 135 people weren't shot this year is absolutely incredible,\" White said.\nBesides the tumbling homicide numbers nationwide, Asher said preliminary data shows significant decreases in nearly every type of violent and property crime, except for auto theft which has risen 10%. Through the first three quarters of the year, he said aggravated assaults were down 7%, robbery declined 9% and the number of rapes fell 15%.\n\"It's something that I think ideally deserves more attention. We certainly pay attention when things go up,\" Asher said. \"I think that we should be talking about it and writing about it, and discussing it when it goes down as well because there are important things to learn there, and we should be acknowledging what's happening.\"\nDespite the reductions in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide, recent polls indicate the majority of Americans believe overall crime is out of control.\n\"Seventy-something percent of Americans believe crime is rising this year. And seventy-something percent of Americans in this case just happen to be wrong,\" Asher said, citing the Gallup poll last month.\nAsher's analysis appears to correspond with a report released last week by the Council on Criminal Justice, a think tank comprised of policy leaders in the criminal justice field. The CCJ analyzed preliminary crime data from 30 large U.S. cities and found that homicides in the first half of the year fell 9.4%.\n\"If this trend continues through the end of 2023, the nation will have experienced one of the largest single-year homicide reductions in the era of modern record-keeping,\" the CCJ said in a statement.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings across the nation, also reports a significant 9% drop in gun homicides this year. As of Dec. 26, 18,513 people had been victims of homicide, about 1,700 fewer than in 2022, according to the website.\nThe sizable fall in homicides comes after a record high in murders was set in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when courts were mostly closed and jail populations were being drastically reduced in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"Certainly, after it hit, we saw backlogs of cases and delayed trials and things like that,\" White said. \"There was no real accountability for bad acts.\"\nAccording to the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which analyzed data from 15,897 law enforcement agencies, the largest single-year jump in murders in more than a century occurred between 2019 and 2020 as murders and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses nationwide rose nearly 30%.\nHomicides across the country continued to increase in 2021 by 4.3% before falling by 6% in 2022, according to the FBI report.\nSan Antonio, Texas, the nation's seventh biggest city, has experienced a nearly 12% decline in homicides this year, after seeing murders rise by 43% in 2022 compared to 2021.\nSan Antonio Police Chief William McManus told ABC News that the 231 homicides that occurred in his city in 2022, included the deaths of 53 migrants found in the back of an abandoned tractor-trailer as part of a human smuggling operation.\n\"If you're looking at including those numbers, we're looking at about a 32% decrease. But if you extract those numbers, we're looking at a 12% decrease year-to-date,\" McManus said. \"But we're not complaining about 12% though.\"\nOne of the multiple crimefighting strategies McManus attributed to his city's falling homicide numbers was first suggested by a team of criminologists at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\"Actually, it was a very simple strategy that, quite frankly, I was somewhat skeptical of at first,\" McManus said.\nHe said by examining calls to the city's computer-aided dispatch system (CAD), the police department identified 28 areas of the city with the highest numbers of violent crime calls and even pinpointed certain days and times when the volume of calls is the highest.\n\"We will sit there at that location with our emergency lights on for 10 to 15 minutes. That's about as proactive as it gets,\" McManus said. \"We're not getting out stopping people or knocking on doors or anything like that. It's simply a high visibility, hot-spot policing effort.\"\nMcManus said that in the coming year, he plans to try other crimefighting strategies involving the city's public works department and animal control services.\n\"Specifically, to mention Animal Care Services, if you have a bunch of dogs running around, it brings the quality of life in that neighborhood down,\" McManus said. \"If you have a bunch of abandoned properties that are not being tended to, it brings the quality of life of that neighborhood down. Those properties could be used for drug sales, drug use, prostitution, all those things that make a neighborhood feel unsafe.\"\nAnother strategy is to \"address specific actors that are involved in violent crime,\" he said.\n\"We pull them in, most of them are under supervision, and we offer them services, we offer them possible employment. If you choose to accept that type of help, whatever it may be, then good for you,\" McManus said. \"But if you don't, then the next time you're arrested, we're going to throw the book at you.\"\nIn Phoenix, the nation's fifth largest city, interim Police Chief Michael Sullivan credited a 15% decline in homicides this year to a crimefighting strategy focused on clearing the streets of violent criminals in possession of guns.\n\"We know that if we focus on those areas, we're going to see reductions, and we did this year,\" Sullivan told ABC News.\nSullivan said his department launched \"Operation Summer Shield\" this year, which involved the help of federal and other local law enforcement agencies to round up people with warrants for their arrests. He said the operation resulted in the arrests of 580 people, with 70% wanted for felonies.\n\"I think we seized 40 guns from those prohibited possessors,\" Sullivan said.\nSullivan said he has also used the strategy of putting detectives on the streets during the summer months to help increase patrols, saying, such a move has \"been very important in helping us control the homicide number this year.\"\nLike in Detroit, Sullivan said non-fatal shootings, which he described as \"truly failed homicides,\" are down 18% this year and attributes that to the launch of a \"Non-Fatal Shooting Investigation Squad\" that responds whenever a bullet pierces the skin to assist or assume the investigation.\nBut like other police chiefs in cities with falling homicide numbers, Sullivan said community engagement has been the most beneficial in the post-pandemic era.\n\"Community engagement is much easier when you're not doing it on a Zoom call, when you're having face-to-face meetings with the community and being able to build that trust,\" Sullivan said. \"When I talk about community engagement, you put a lot of deposits in the bank before people trust enough to be able to give us the information to close crimes.\"\nSullivan said his agency has also focused on recruiting the best officers for the job.\n\"What we would expect from our police departments is to have a good strategy. But then you have to have women and men who can go out and execute that strategy,\" Sullivan said. \"That's what we have here at the Phoenix Police Department, and I believe that's a recipe for success.\"",

    "title": "Creer en los derechos otorgados por Dios indica \"nacionalismo cristiano\", dice periodista Político",
    "text": "Creer en los derechos otorgados por Dios indica \"nacionalismo cristiano\", dice periodista Político Un periodista de investigación galardonado en Política afirmó durante un panel de MSNBC el jueves que creer que los derechos provienen de Dios es un marcador de \"nacionalismo cristiano\". [Heidi Przybyla](https://www.heidiprzybyla.com/) también afirmó en \"All In with Chris Hayes\" que el expresidente Donald Trump se está rodeando de un \"elemento extremista de cristianos conservadores\" que están abusando de la \"llamada ley natural\" en su intento de hacer retroceder el aborto y los derechos LBGT. \"Recuerden que cuando Trump se postuló en 2016, muchos de los principales evangélicos no querían tener nada que ver con el magnate inmobiliario divorciado que había engañado a su esposa con una estrella porno y todo eso, ¿verdad? Entonces, lo que pasó fue que estaba rodeado de este elemento más extremista\", afirmó Przybyla. \"Oirán palabras como 'nacionalismo cristiano', como 'Reforma Nueva Apostólica'\", continuó. \"Estos son grupos sobre los que hay que educarse mucho porque tienen mucho poder en el círculo de Trump\". Przybyla continuó haciendo una distinción entre cristianos y \"nacionalistas cristianos\", que según ella son \"muy diferentes\". Lo que une a todos los nacionalistas cristianos, dijo, \"es que creen que nuestros derechos como estadounidenses, como todos los seres humanos, no provienen de ninguna autoridad terrenal\". \"No vienen del Congreso, no vienen de la Corte Suprema, vienen de Dios\", añadió. \"El problema con eso es que ellos están determinando -el hombre, los hombres, y son los hombres- están determinando lo que Dios les está diciendo\". Llamándolo \"un pilar del catolicismo\", Przybyla señaló que la ley natural \"ha sido utilizada para el bien y en campañas de justicia social\", incluida la lucha de Martin Luther King Jr. por los derechos civiles, pero sugirió \"un elemento extremista de los cristianos conservadores\". Ahora están malinterpretando la ley natural al aplicarla al aborto y al matrimonio homosexual. \"Y va mucho más allá, como se puede ver, por ejemplo, con un fallo en Alabama esta semana que dictaron jueces relacionados con esa facción dominionista\", dijo, refiriéndose a la reciente decisión de la Corte Suprema de Alabama que [dictaminó](https://www.christianpost.com/news/ivf-embryos-are-legally-protected-children-alabama-court-rules.html) que los embriones congelados creados mediante fertilización in vitro son seres humanos protegidos por la ley estatal. Los comentarios de Przybyla hicieron eco de algunas de las afirmaciones de su reciente [artículo para Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/20/donald-trump-allies-christian-nationalism-00142086) titulado \"Los aliados de Trump se preparan para infundir 'nacionalismo cristiano' en la segunda administración\", que argumentaba que es probable que el nacionalismo cristiano desempeñe un papel importante en las políticas públicas si Trump recupera el poder Casa. El artículo, que también fue escrito por Alexander Ward, definía la ley natural como \"la creencia de que existen reglas universales derivadas de Dios que no pueden ser reemplazadas por el gobierno o los jueces\", y también la llamaba \"un pilar del catolicismo\" que ha \"se ha utilizado para oponerse al aborto, los derechos LGBTQ+ y la anticoncepción\" en las últimas décadas. El objetivo principal del artículo era Russell Vought, ex director de la Oficina de Gestión y Presupuesto de Trump, uno de los [muchos miembros de X que criticaron](https://twitter.com/WadeMiller_USMC/status/1761015125673222572/quotes) a Przybyla el viernes por comentarios que, según ellos, mostraban ignorancia del pensamiento político estadounidense básico, como se encuentra en la segunda frase de La declaración de independencia. \"Mike Johnson debería presentar una resolución reafirmando que somos una nación, bajo Dios. Hacer que los demócratas voten en contra o serán llamados nacionalistas cristianos\", [tuiteó](https://twitter.com/russvought/status/1761027284712997013) Vought. El artículo de Politico también atacó al ex funcionario de la administración Trump, William Wolfe, etiquetándolo de nacionalista cristiano porque \"abogó por revocar el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo, poner fin al aborto y reducir el acceso a los anticonceptivos\". \"En una publicación de diciembre, [Wolfe] pidió poner fin a la educación sexual en las escuelas, la subrogación y el divorcio sin culpa en todo el país, así como obligar a los hombres 'a mantener a sus hijos tan pronto como se determine que el niño es suyo' - una clara incursión del gobierno en la vida privada de los estadounidenses\", decía el artículo. Wolfe también contribuyó a la tormenta en X en respuesta a Przybyla. \"Aparentemente, creer en las ideas establecidas en nuestros documentos fundacionales ahora te convierte, lo adivinaste, en un 'nacionalista cristiano'\", escribió [,](https://twitter.com/William_E_Wolfe/status/1761071648193581250) y agregó: \"Sí, Heidi, nuestros derechos provienen de Dios. Una vez más, la ignorancia de estos \"Los periodistas del régimen son asombrosos. No saben nada sobre la fundación estadounidense o el pensamiento político cristiano\". Otros apuntaron, como el representante estatal republicano de Texas, Brian Harrison, quien [escribió](https://twitter.com/brianeharrison/status/1761060773659279570) : \"Los cimientos mismos de los Estados Unidos que construyeron nuestros fundadores están bajo ataque. Cualquier republicano electo que no haga todo lo posible para defenderse es cómplice\". \"Politico ya ha levantado dos veces, en forma impresa y con su reportero en MSNBC, banderas sobre una idea central para la fundación de la República Americana\", [tuiteó](https://twitter.com/EWErickson/status/1761059335772197216) el periodista Erick Erickson. \"Esto es preocupante porque sugiere una falta de educación y comprensión por parte de sus periodistas\". \"Creer que los derechos provienen de Dios es ahora nacionalismo cristiano\", [escribió](https://twitter.com/andrewtwalk/status/1761036021817315496) Andrew T. Walker, profesor de ética y teología pública en el Seminario Teológico Bautista del Sur. \"Esto es un fracaso cívico, un fracaso de talento, un fracaso de inteligencia, un fracaso histórico, un fracaso ético... ¿debo seguir adelante? Siempre tendremos élites. Pero, cielos, necesitamos mejores élites\". Przybyla respondió el viernes a algunas de las críticas que estaba recibiendo en X, [alegando que](https://twitter.com/HeidiReports/status/1761048690804826589) se estaban malinterpretando sus palabras. \"Si bien hay diferentes alas del nacionalismo cristiano, están unidas por la creencia de que nuestros derechos provienen de Dios\", [escribió](https://twitter.com/HeidiReports/status/1761064510561861962) . \"Si eres hindú, judío, etc., esto podría ayudarte a entender la siguiente parte de mi punto, que es que están usando esto para una agenda política creada por el hombre. Lo que lo distingue de otros cristianos que dejan estos derechos otorgados por Dios a nuestro derecho inherente a la 'Vida, libertad y la búsqueda de la felicidad', frente a la prohibición del aborto, la anticoncepción, etc.\"",

    "title": "“All In” – Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Rambled Through A Nonsensical Press Conference Where He Related Himself To Patrick Mahomes | Whiskey Riff",
    "text": "Jerry Jones rambling through a press conference and being nonsensical and borderline unintelligible? It’s clear that it’s probably time for him to step away from his football duties with the Dallas Cowboys… because it’s time for him to run for president. The soon-to-be 82-year-old was speaking with the media today during Dallas Cowboys training camp, and objectively speaking, he didn’t make a whole lot of sense in what he was saying (or trying to say). If you were to ask Jerry Jones how he felt about what he said, he’d likely tell you he nailed it. But watching these videos from his time with the media today… I’d beg to differ. First up, Dallas Cowboys fans are going to hate to see this. Jones once again proclaimed that for this upcoming season, he and the Dallas Cowboys are “all in.” That phrase haunted fans of Dallas last season, and considering that Jones failed to make any splashy moves to acquire free agents this offseason (Ezekiel Elliot is back as their starting running back), I’m not sure that saying “all in” is warranted. But don’t panic, because Jerry Jones explained what he meant by saying “all in:” “I’m all in. I’m all in. Sometimes being all in means you narrow… you remove the months out here that are in the future. And you narrow it down to where all we’re talking about is right now and the next playoff season, and that’s it for everybody. We’re all in. It’s all right there. Let’s, let’s, let’s… okay?” [#Cowboys]owner Jerry Jones again today: \"I'm all in. I'm all in.\" And then he goes on to explain what that means… [pic.twitter.com/PPzZXHHIZy] — Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) [July 25, 2024] Anyone have a Jerry Jones translator handy? You’ll definitely need it for this next quote, which featured Jones pontificating about how he normally waits for a long time to extend his players. In it, he used a metaphor of him being an option quarterback, and compared himself to Patrick Mahomes (a non-Cowboy player who rarely runs the option). For those that might think I’m adding or detracting from this to purposely make him sound senile, I’ll transcribe exactly what he said just like I did above: “We are so involved in trying to see where we are with our situation. That that is a major part of seeing where… seeing the leaves fall. Seeing the time go by. Seeing this day and this week, how they go by. I have, in my life, played option quarterback so many times and wait until the last leaf on the tree. If you want to picture a pure option quarterback going out to the sideline, I have run that ball and kept it, not handed it off to the back, not pitched it back, not thrown it. And I have run that thing all the way out to the sideline before I made the decision. Because I couldn’t make… I couldn’t get whatever it took to, it wasn’t right for me, to make the decision. And so what our fans, what you’re seeing, what we deal with is we’re buying time. We’re option quarterbacking and we’re going on out to the sideline and we haven’t handed it off, haven’t pitched it, we’re trying to make our mind up what to do. Does that sound like Mahomes to you?” [#Cowboys]owner Jerry Jones compared himself to Patrick Mahomes when explaining why it's smart to take your time before extending a player. Jerry said he's like an option quarterback reading the market. This is a doozy. [pic.twitter.com/EM8A1s3aEu] — Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) [July 25, 2024] Sheesh… have fun going “all in” with Jerry Jones for yet another year Dallas Cowboys fans. And Jerry, if you truly are an option quarterback, it sounds like it’s time to hand the ball off… to your successor.",

    "title": "Seminare semi di buona fortuna tra le spine | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Dal 20 luglio 1999, giorno in cui il Partito Comunista Cinese (PCC) ha lanciato la persecuzione della Falun Dafa (chiamata anche Falun Gong), i praticanti della disciplina spirituale rischiano la propria incolumità per salvare le persone chiarendo loro la verità sui fatti. Desidero condividere alcune storie di persone che sono cambiate in meglio dopo aver accettato quanto loro raccontato. Il fortunato incontro di una contadina con la Dafa Ho 72 anni e ho iniziato a praticare la Falun Dafa nel 2004. Sono cresciuta in una zona rurale e la mia salute era molto cagionevole a causa del duro lavoro che affrontavo quotidianamente. Il mio primo marito è morto presto. Mio figlio maggiore ha prestato servizio nell'esercito per tre anni ed è stato assegnato a lavorare in una piccola città. Vedendo che la mia salute stava peggiorando rapidamente, mi ha aiutato a trasferirmi in città per ricevere cure mediche migliori. Mi ha portato in ospedale, dove mi sono stati diagnosticati vari disturbi: colecistite, epatomegalia, gastroptosi, osteoporosi e bassa immunità. Il medico ha affermato che erano tutti legati al sistema digestivo, pertanto non mi ha consigliato il ricovero ma mi ha dato delle medicine da portare a casa e indicato la terapia che dovevo seguire. Da allora in poi ho preso medicine tutti i giorni e non mi è stato permesso di mangiare nulla di solido; mangiavo prevalentemente del porridge. Sono diventata sempre più magra e il mio peso è sceso da sessanta chili a 36. In quel momento, sentivo che non solo stavo soffrendo molto ma anche danneggiando la mia famiglia, e non volevo davvero più vivere! Proprio quando ho iniziato a disperare, il mio destino ha preso una svolta. Nel 2004 mi è stato presentato un funzionario in pensione e ci siamo sposati. Un giorno, una collega di mio marito, praticante della Falun Dafa, è venuta a trovarci. Mi ha chiesto se conoscevo la Falun Dafa e le ho detto di no. Ha detto: “La Falun Dafa è davvero meravigliosa. Insegna alle persone a diventare buone, cura le malattie ed è ottima per la salute. In passato avevo molte malattie, ma sono guarita completamente dopo aver iniziato a praticare la Falun Dafa”. I miei occhi si sono illuminati e ho chiesto: “Davvero? Per favore insegnami gli esercizi!”. Ha detto: “Domani ti darò un libro... come prima cosa potrai iniziare leggendo quello”. Il giorno successivo mi ha portato lo [Zhuan Falun], il libro principale della Falun Dafa. Quando sono andata alla prima pagina e ho visto la foto del Maestro, fondatore della Falun Dafa, mi sono sentita come se stessi vedendo un parente scomparso da tempo e le lacrime mi hanno coperto il viso. La seconda notte dopo aver iniziato a leggere lo Zhuan Falun ho avuto la diarrea e ho passato tutta la notte in bagno; ho avuto anche la febbre a 42 gradi. La collega di mio marito mi ha spiegato: “Il Maestro si sta prendendo cura di te e sta purificando il tuo corpo”. In effetti sentivo che quella volta era diverso, perché quando avevo la diarrea in passato ero molto debole e dovevo restare a letto, tuttavia in quella circostanza ero ancora molto energica. Ero molto felice e anche sorpresa. Non avevo ancora iniziato a praticare ufficialmente la Falun Dafa e avevo letto solo poche pagine dello Zhuan Falun, tuttavia il Maestro si stava già prendendo cura di me e stava purificando il mio corpo, proprio come descritto nel libro. Prima che il PCC lanciasse la persecuzione, mio marito praticava la Dafa. Tuttavia dopo che è iniziata, tutti i suoi libri della Falun Dafa sono stati confiscati illegalmente e ha smesso di praticare. Di conseguenza, le malattie che in passato lo avevano tormentato si sono ripresentate e le cure mediche non sono state di aiuto. Praticavo gli esercizi con lui, tuttavia a quel tempo non sapevo cosa fosse la coltivazione, ero semplicemente grata al Maestro per aver migliorato la mia salute e avermi dato una nuova vita. Un giorno ho sentito una voce che diceva: “Riflettete: che cosa significa insegnare il qigong verso i livelli elevati? Non è forse salvare la gente? È salvare la gente - state coltivando veramente voi stessi, non si tratta soltanto di curare i vostri disturbi e di rafforzare la vostra salute.” (Prima lezione, [Zhuan Falun](https://it.falundafa.org/imported/zfl/zfl.htm)) Ho guardato dietro di me e tutt’intorno, ma non ho visto nessuno. Più tardi ho letto questo passaggio dello Zhuan Falun e solo allora ho capito che era il Maestro che cercava di illuminarmi. Mi stava dicendo che coltivare non significava solo liberarsi dalle malattie e mantenersi in forma. Mio marito è uno sciovinista. Controllava tutti i nostri soldi e non mi permetteva di spenderli, il che mi faceva molto arrabbiare. Tuttavia da quando ho iniziato a praticare la Dafa non potevo più discutere con lui o litigare, di conseguenza ero soffocata dalla rabbia dentro di me e di notte versavo lacrime nel letto sotto le coperte. Una mattina, quando mi sono alzata, ho visto una grande mano che mi porgeva un piatto di legno marrone con sopra una ciotola di riso. Poi ho sentito la voce del Maestro: “Finché avrai qualcosa da mangiare, starai bene”. Ho subito pianto al pensiero che avevo fatto sì che il Maestro si preoccupasse per me. Da quel momento in poi non mi è più importato dei soldi e sono stata felice ogni giorno. Una caduta all'età di settant'anni Nell'estate del 2021 sono caduta mentre andavo in bicicletta. Mi sono ritrovata a terra e ci ho messo un po' a realizzare cosa era successo, poi ho pensato: “Sto bene”, e mi sono alzata rapidamente. Sono tornata a casa spingendo la bicicletta, poi mi sono sentita di nuovo male e ho deciso di sdraiarmi sul letto. Il giorno dopo non riuscivo ad alzarmi; tutto il mio corpo era insensibile e non potevo muovermi. I miei tre figli erano spaventati e temevano che restassi paralizzata, così hanno cercato insistentemente di portarmi in ospedale per un controllo. Ho detto loro: “Sono una praticante della Dafa e starò bene. L’ospedale non può curare la mia malattia e sarebbe uno spreco di soldi. Sapete tutti che pratico da tanti anni e la mia salute è molto buona. Non sono stata attenta e sono caduta. Quando le persone soffrono un po’, potrebbe non essere una brutta cosa! Non preoccupatevi, tra qualche giorno starò bene!”. Se ne sono andati, ma erano ancora spaventati. Conoscevo il principio secondo cui bisogna passare attraverso la sofferenza per ripagare i propri debiti karmici, quindi ho provato semplicemente a sopportare il dolore fisico. Studiando la [Fa] ho scoperto che avevo molti attaccamenti e nozioni umane negative, per cui ho cercato di lasciarli andare uno dopo l'altro. Ho pensato: “Sono una praticante, perciò devo essere in grado di sopportare il dolore e le difficoltà... non posso restare a letto!”. Il terzo giorno mi sono alzata per fare gli esercizi della Dafa. Tuttavia, poiché le gambe non riuscivano a sostenere il mio peso, li ho fatti appoggiandomi al letto. Poi mi sono aggrappata a una panca per camminare poco a poco. Nel giro di pochi giorni ho potuto cucinare e mangiare da sola. La domenica successiva i miei figli sono venuti di nuovo a trovarmi ed è venuto anche uno dei miei suoceri. Appena sono entrati nella stanza e mi hanno visto in piedi, sono rimasti stupiti. Hanno detto: “Stai bene? Eravamo tutti spaventati perché non hai voluto curarti. Come hai fatto a riprenderti così in fretta? La Falun Dafa è davvero miracolosa!”. Un giovane non voleva che riattaccassi Negli ultimi anni ho iniziato a comprare schede telefoniche per chiamare le persone e [chiarire loro la verità] sulla Falun Dafa. Un giorno ha risposto un giovane. Dopo che ho detto poche parole, ha detto: “Finalmente ti ho trovato. Non è necessario che tu dica altro... ho già ascoltato quattro di queste chiamate e ho capito tutto. Sono un membro del PCC, per favore aiutami a ritirarmi”. L'ho aiutato a farlo usando uno pseudonimo ed è stato molto felice. Gli ho poi spiegato come aiutare i suoi familiari a lasciare il PCC e le sue organizzazioni giovanili. Ha detto: “Non riattaccare ancora. Chiamerò il nostro manager e potrai chiedere anche a lui di ritirarsi”. L'ho sentito correre a bussare a una porta e poi dire: “Direttore, venga a sentire questa telefonata! Ti aiuterà a dimetterti dal PCC e a rimanere al sicuro durante le catastrofi!”. Tuttavia il suo manager non ha voluto farlo e gli ha detto di lasciarlo in pace. Il giovane è tornato al telefono e ha detto: “Non riattaccare ancora, c'è qualcun altro!”. Poi l'ho sentito dire: “Ling, vieni fuori velocemente e ascolta la telefonata. Qualcuno ti aiuterà a stare al sicuro e a evitare le catastrofi”. È venuta al telefono una ragazza e le ho detto: “Sei davvero fortunata ad avere un collega così eccezionale. Vuole che anche tu sia al sicuro! Quello che vorrei dirti oggi è che molti cinesi si stanno ritirando dal PCC proprio per evitare le catastrofi ed essere al sicuro. Questo perché quando hai aderito al Partito, hai giurato di dedicargli la vita e lottare per esso per tutta l'esistenza. Da quando hai fatto quel genere di giuramento la tua vita appartiene al Partito, e anche se dimenticherai di averlo fatto, il Cielo non lo dimenticherà. Quando il Cielo distruggerà il PCC, le persone che hanno fatto il giuramento soffriranno, ma se adesso ti ritirerai dal PCC, quel giuramento velenoso sarà cancellato, sarai libera da quell'organizzazione malvagia e riceverai benedizioni dal Cielo. Questo è il motivo per cui dobbiamo tutti ritirarci dal PCC. Pensi che abbia senso?”. “Sì”, ha detto. “Mi ritirerò, grazie!”. Ho detto: “Non c’è bisogno che mi ringrazi. Come praticanti della Falun Dafa, è nostro desiderio che tutti gli esseri senzienti siano salvati. Dovresti ringraziare il nostro Maestro, è lui che ti sta salvando!”. Entrambi hanno detto insieme: “Grazie, Maestro della Falun Dafa!”. Le prigioniere recitano le due frasi di buon auspicio Nel 2011, sono stata arrestata e portata in un centro di detenzione perché praticavo la Dafa. Quando sono stata portata in cella per la prima volta, qualcuno mi ha detto a bassa voce: “Il capo di questa cella è molto feroce. Impreca e picchia le persone a suo piacimento e costringe le praticanti del Falun Gong a fare tutto il lavoro sporco e faticoso... e se non lo finiscono in tempo, le punisce. Devi stare attenta!”. La responsabile della cella era sulla trentina ed era detenuta per spaccio di droga. Poteva entrare e uscire dalla cella a suo piacimento e mangiare quello che voleva. Tuttavia, un giorno, è apparsa molto triste, perché aveva sentito dire che sarebbe stata condannata a 12 anni di reclusione. Pochi giorni dopo le è venuta improvvisamente la febbre alta e nonostante le cure mediche, non stava migliorando. Per due giorni e due notti non è riuscita a dormire molto. Sono andata a parlarle. “Conosco un metodo che può aiutarti”, ho detto. “Ma sta a te crederci o no. Tutto quello che devi fare è recitare in silenzio le due frasi di buon auspicio: 'La Falun Dafa è buona' e 'Verità, Compassione e Tolleranza sono buone'”. Ha affermato di credermi. Allora ho detto: “Dovresti anche lasciare le organizzazioni del PCC”. Ha detto: “Quando ero giovane ho aderito ai Giovani Pionieri e alla Lega della Gioventù Comunista. Il mio cognome è Zhang, aiutami a ritirarmi!”. L'ho guardata negli occhi e ho spiegato: “Le persone che trattano i praticanti della Dafa con gentilezza saranno benedette; coloro che perseguitano i praticanti della Dafa dovranno pagare per le loro malefatte”. Vedendola annuire, ho detto: “Adesso puoi iniziare a recitare in silenzio le due frasi”. La mattina dopo si è alzata molto presto. È venuta da me e ha sussurrato: “Signora, mi sono ripresa! È miracoloso!”. Poi se n'è andata con il sorriso sul volto. Poco dopo è tornata portando due piatti deliziosi, ciascuno dei quali composto da porridge di miglio, due uova, un bastoncino di pasta fritta e due verdure saltate in padella. Ne ha tenuto uno per sé e ha dato l'altro a me. In confronto, il cibo distribuito alla mensa del centro di detenzione era costituito semplicemente da panini al vapore e zuppa congelata di cavolo ancora sporco di fango. Da allora, ogni giorno faceva bollire dell'acqua in una grande pentola, che poi metteva davanti a me. Poi diceva a tutti: “Questa è acqua bollita per le praticanti del Falun Gong. A nessun'altra è permesso berla!”. Una settimana dopo, una guardia è entrata con in mano un pezzo di carta e le ha detto di fare le valigie e di tornare a casa, aggiungendo che era stata condannata a tre anni di libertà condizionata. Incredula, ha afferrato il foglio e lo ha letto più volte. Ha iniziato a piangere di gioia e a saltare abbracciata a una compagna di cella. Con le lacrime agli occhi ha detto: “Il giorno in cui ho saputo che sarei stata condannata a 12 anni di reclusione, non volevo più vivere... oggi sono stata davvero benedetta dal Cielo!”. Le ho detto: “Ragazza mia, ti rendi conto di cosa è successo? Sei stata benedetta perché hai compreso la verità e trattato bene i praticanti della Dafa!”. Lei ha detto: “Sì, sì!”. Ha poi unito le mani davanti al petto e mi ha ringraziato. Ho detto: “Non devi ringraziare me. Dovresti ringraziare il Maestro della Dafa!”. Ha detto in fretta: “Grazie, Maestro del Falun Gong! Grazie, Maestro del Falun Gong!”. Dopo di che se n'è tornata a casa felice. Nei due giorni successivi alla sua partenza, 19 persone su 21 presenti nella nostra cella si sono dimesse dal PCC e dalle sue organizzazioni giovanili affiliate. I miei familiari recitano le due frasi di buon auspicio per sopravvivere alla pandemia Quando, alla fine del 2022, la pandemia ha raggiunto il culmine in Cina, una sera intorno alle 22:00, mio figlio maggiore mi ha chiamato e ha detto: “Mamma, mi sento malissimo!”. Ho detto: “Ricordi che nei momenti critici devi recitare le due frasi di buon auspicio?”. Ha detto: “L’avevo dimenticato. Inizierò a farlo ora!”. La mattina presto del giorno dopo ha richiamato: “Adesso mi sono ripreso, ma mia moglie e mio figlio sono malati!”. Ho detto: “Dì loro di fare la stessa cosa e tutto andrà bene”. Il giorno dopo, entrambi si sono ripresi. Ero preoccupata per mia sorella e la sua famiglia e così l'ho chiamata. Ha detto che aveva preso il virus ed era in piedi nella stanza perché non poteva sedersi; aggiungendo che era rimasta senza fiato tutta la notte precedente. Le ho subito detto: “Recitare le due frasi della Dafa potrà salvarti la vita!”. Il giorno dopo, mia sorella mi ha chiamato e ha detto: “Le ho recitate per tutta la notte. Adesso sto bene e posso sdraiarmi per dormire!”. Tutti i contenuti pubblicati su questo sito sono protetti dal copyright di Minghui.org.
