    "text": "Aging can be a time when bodies slow down, but that does not mean people can’t be healthy or have fun.\nBecky Behling, 72, proves this every day. Behling has taught fitness for 36 years. After moving to Manhattan two years ago from Texas, Behling began teaching fitness at the Manhattan Senior Center.\nBehling said she was not always athletic. She had severe asthma, and there were no girls’ athletics where she grew up. When transferring universities midway between sophomore and junior year, a counselor at Taylor University in Upland, Indiana, suggested going into physical education.\n“I was looking at different colleges and a counselor at Taylor University asked, ‘What do you love to do more than anything?’ and I said waterski, because it was one thing I could do that did not set off an asthma attack.”\nBehling got into athletic training when recovering from a dislocated kneecap, caused by swinging a golf club. She said the only people who could explain what happened were the athletic trainers.\nIn the early 1970s, Behling was among one of the first women to become certified by the National Athletic Trainers Association. When Behling began studying to become an athletic trainer, the program was not welcoming toward women.\n“When I wanted to take the class in my undergraduate work, I had to petition because it was closed to women,” Behling said. “It was the class that was rolled in with the coaching of baseball, basketball, and athletic training.”\nBehling said her academic adviser was supportive, so she was allowed in the class. After finishing her bachelor’s degree at DePauw University, she went on to get her master’s degree at the University of Arizona. This took place around 1972, when Title IX, the law prohibiting sex-based discrimination, passed.\n“There were only two universities at the master’s level that allowed women in their athletic training programs,” Behling said. “Men’s athletics were opening, reluctantly, to women and not very willing to share their money.”\nBehling was an athletic trainer at the University of Kansas, from 1976 to 1977 and was the second woman to hold that position there.\n“I had very little budget, no help, no training room. I had an office in the corner of Allen Fieldhouse,” Behling said. “I had finished working one of the women’s games and went to the fieldhouse to get into my office and was denied access because there was a men’s event going on. I was asked to pay for parking and where was my ticket?”\nIt is a story Behling is fond of telling, about how different things were several decades ago. She has not been back to the University of Kansas since working there.\n“I’ve often said it’s better to be a lead dog than a follow dog because the view is much better,” Behling said. “It takes an amount of courage and some vision. I couldn’t understand why women weren’t welcome in that program to begin with because there were women in intercollegiate athletics.”\nWhile college sports teams existed at the time, Behling remembers how these college athletes would raise money on their own with bake sales to pay for their uniforms and travel because the college would not fund it.\n“It means a lot to me because it was such a lovely pathway to tap into the skills I never thought I had,” Behling said. “For example, when I made my major change, I was required to take anatomy and physiology because there were so few physical education students in my school and classes were made up of pre-med and nursing students so that’s how teaching was directed.”\nDespite being told she would fail anatomy by the other students, Behling passed with an A, proving them wrong. She came to love the subject of human anatomy and even went on to teach anatomy to massage therapy students from 2010 to 2015, in Austin, Texas.\nBehling teaches a type of exercise therapy called the Feldenkrais method, developed in the mid-20th century by Moshe Feldenkrais. She was introduced to this method in Texas by a friend in a yoga class, who recommended attending a seminar about it.\n“It’s a way of approaching movement improvement by becoming aware of what you do,” Behling said. “He constructed what he called lessons in ways that start with very small movements and build on that. People are asked to move slowly, gently, carefully, not many (movements), never to go to a place where there is pain and to rest as often as they need.”\nBehling said she teaches people of all ages and abilities, including those with disabilities, going at their pace. She has worked with people recovering from strokes, who claimed the classes were life saving.\n“It’s an opportunity to improve the quality of life, health, well-being, stamina and mental outlook of anyone who walks into class,” Behling said. “There’s a lot of research that’s been done about the social aspects of being in a group and the dynamic that people have. I think when you combine that with movement and good music, it’s a positive outcome for most people.”\nBehling and her husband moved to Manhattan in November 2021, to live closer to her daughter and her husband. They made the move from Austin to Kansas. She began teaching fitness at the senior center that same year.\n“My mom has always had the gift of teaching,” Nancy Finch, Behling’s daughter, said. “She has the gift of curiosity — she will absorb and learn as much as she can and then turn around and share that with others. I, and many others, have admired her amazing gift of teaching others how to exercise and live more healthy, active lives.”\nThese classes provide participants with the opportunity to socialize with people in their own age group. Behling said many senior citizens who attend are widows and tend to form bonds over shared experiences.\nBehling said the most rewarding part of her job is watching people improve their health and lives overall.\n“The biggest challenge I think is getting people to understand they don’t have to hurt themselves to get a benefit,” Behling said. “Low- to moderate-intensity exercise can reap all kinds of benefits.”",

    "text": "A suggestion that three republicans were on holiday in Colombia rather than training rebels was said to be “insulting to (the) intelligence” of diplomats, archive documents show.\nThere was concern at the time that the arrest of the so-called Colombia Three in 2001 could damage the Northern Ireland peace process.\nThe incident happened after the IRA agreed on a way of disabling its arsenal, following months of slow progress.\nColombian authorities alleged that the men were training members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as Farc.\nThe men were convicted of training rebels and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2004; they were granted amnesty in 2020 as part of Colombia’s peace process.\nIn 2022, it was reported that their amnesty had been revoked.\nThe Colombia Three have always denied wrongdoing, maintaining they were in the country to observe Colombia’s peace negotiations.\nThe three men, who were travelling on false passports, Niall Connolly, James Monaghan, and Martin McCauley, were arrested on August 11 2001 at Bogota International Airport.\nIn newly released State documents, the discussion between top Irish and US officials in the aftermath of the arrests show that the US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland Richard Haass was angry at the incident.\nIn a meeting between Mr Haas and Ireland’s Ambassador to the US Sean O hUiginn, he said the men were “not on vacation, they were not promoting a peace process”.\n“It was not only implausible to try to put across such explanations but insulting to our intelligence.\n“A far better course would be to admit that a mistake had been made and say that it would not happen again.\n“It was far more likely that the detainees were involved in some kind of ‘transfer of knowhow about bomb-making’.”\nA briefing document written for the Department of Foreign Affairs detailed a meeting in Washington DC between Mr Haass and Ireland’s Ambassador to the US Sean Ó hUiginn.\nThe document notes that the Irish and British governments were “obviously in stocktaking mode to work out a strategy in relation to developments in the peace process, including of course the Colombia dimension”.\n“The benign explanation that the three might have been engaged in peace education was not sustainable.\n“Rather the choice was from the malign menu, for example, of some kind of weapons dealing, testing or training,” the note dated September 7 2001 said.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/53/29",

    "title": "‘So much death’: Lawmakers weigh stricter speed limits, safer roads for pedestrians – Orange County Register",
    "text": "By Vanessa G. Sánchez, KFF Health News\nLOS ANGELES — The party was winding down. Its young hosts, María Rivas Cruz and her fiancé, Raymond Olivares, had accompanied friends to their car to bid them farewell. As the couple crossed a four-lane main road back to the home they had just bought, Rivas Cruz and Olivares were struck by a car fleeing an illegal street race. The driver was going 70 in a 40-mph zone.Despite years of pleading for a two-lane road, lower speed limits, safety islands, and more marked crosswalks, residents say the county had done little to address speeding in this unincorporated pocket of southeastern Los Angeles. Since 2012, this half-mile stretch of Avalon Boulevard had logged 396 crashes, injuring 170 and killing three.Olivares, 27, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, became the fourth fatality when he was hurled across the street, hit by a second car, and instantly killed. Rivas Cruz was transported to a hospital, where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Once awake, the elementary school teacher underwent a series of reconstructive surgeries to repair her arm, jaw, and legs.In the aftermath of the February 2023 crash, the county installed protective steel posts midway across the street. But residents, who had sought a platformed center divider and speed cameras, said that wasn’t enough.“It’s just a band-aid on a cut. This is supposed to solve it, but it doesn’t, and that is what hurts,” said Rivas Cruz, who now at age 28 walks with a cane and lives with chronic pain. “I go to sleep, and I’m like, ‘It’s just a dream, it’s just a dream.’ And it’s not.”The nation’s road system covers 4 million miles and is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local jurisdictions that often operate in silos, making systemic change difficult and expensive. But amid the highest number of pedestrians killed in decades, localities are pushing to control how speed limits are set and for more accountability on road design. This spring, New York and Michigan passed laws allowing local jurisdictions to lower speed limits. In Los Angeles, voters approved a measure that forces the city to act on its own safety improvement plan , mandating that the car-loving metropolis redesign streets, add bike lanes, and protect cyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians.Still, there’s plenty of political resistance to speed enforcement. In California’s Statehouse, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) proposed requiring GPS-equipped smart devices in new cars and trucks to prevent excessive speeding. But after pushback, the state lawmaker watered down his bill to require all vehicles sold in the state starting in 2032 to have only warning systems that alert drivers when they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph.Although the Biden administration is championing Vision Zero — its commitment to zero traffic deaths — and injecting more than $20 billion in funding for transportation safety programs through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , road safety advocates and some lawmakers argue that the country is still far from making streets and vehicles safe, or slowing drivers down.“We are not showing the political will to use the proven safety tools that exist,” said Leah Shahum, founder of Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit organization advancing Vision Zero in communities across the country.The need for safer roads took on urgency during the covid pandemic. Fatalities rose even as lockdown mandates emptied streets. In 2022 , more than 42,500 people died on American roads, and at least 7,522 pedestrians were fatally struck — the highest tally of pedestrian deaths in more than four decades.Experts cite several reasons for the decline in road safety. During the lockdowns, reckless driving increased while traffic enforcement declined. SUVs and trucks have become larger and heavier, thus deadlier when they hit a pedestrian. Other factors persist as streets remain wide to accommodate vehicles, and in some states speed limits have gradually increased .Early estimates of motor vehicle fatalities show a slight decrease from 2022 to 2023, but pedestrian fatalities are still notably above pre-pandemic numbers . “It’s an encouraging start, but the numbers still constitute a crisis,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote in February of roadway deaths.The Biden administration has directed $15.6 billion to road safety until 2026 and $5 billion in local grants to prevent roadway deaths and injuries. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s new “ vulnerable road user” rule , states with 15% or more deaths involving pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists compared with all road deaths must match federal dollars in their safety improvement spending.Road safety advocates argue the federal government missed an opportunity to eliminate outdated standards for setting speed limits when it revised traffic guidelines last year . The agency could have eliminated guidance recommending setting speed limits at or below how fast 85% of drivers travel on uncongested roads. Critics contend that what’s known as the 85th percentile rule encourages traffic engineers to set speed limits at levels unsafe for pedestrians.But the Federal Highway Administration wrote in a statement that while the 85th percentile is the typical method, engineers rarely rely solely on this rule. It also noted that states and some local agencies have their own criteria for setting speed limits.In response, grassroots efforts to curtail speeding have sprouted across communities. In April, Michigan passed legislation granting local governments authority to round down when setting speed limits.And after four years of lobbying, New York state passed Sammy’s Law, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, who was killed by a driver in Brooklyn in 2013. The law, which will take effect in June, allows New York City to lower its speed limits to 20 mph in designated areas.“With this legislation, I hope we can learn more children’s names because of their accomplishments, their personalities, and their spirit — not their final moments,” said Sammy’s mother, Amy Cohen.Advocates would also like the federal government to factor in pedestrian safety on the five-star vehicle safety rating scale. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a separate pass/fail test that would be posted only on the agency’s website, not on labels consumers would see at the dealership.Automakers like BMW questioned the effectiveness of a program testing pedestrian protections in vehicles arguing that in European countries that adopted such a regulation, it’s not been clear whether it led to fewer deaths and injuries. According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, automakers spent about $49 million lobbying in 2023 compared with $2.2 million spent by advocates for highway and auto safety.“The federal government has the biggest punch when it comes to requiring improved vehicle safety design,” said Wiener, the California state lawmaker.Although Wiener modified his proposal to restrict excessive speeding, he has advanced companion legislation that would require Caltrans, the state transportation agency, to make improvements such as adding crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better serve pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.When that bill was heard in a committee, opponents, including engineering firms and contractors, cautioned it would remove flexibility and hamper the state’s ability to deliver a safe and efficient transportation system. Lawmakers have until Aug. 31 to act on his bills.In Los Angeles, hope for change arrived in March when voters passed Measure HLA , which requires the city to invest $3.1 billion in road safety over the next decade. Rivas Cruz’s house, however, sits eight blocks outside the jurisdiction of the city initiative.It’s been more than a year since the crash, but Rivas Cruz finds reminders everywhere: in the mirror, when she looks at the scars left on her face after several surgeries. When she walks on the street that still lacks the infrastructure that would have protected her and Raymond.Stories of pedestrians killed in this Latino working-class neighborhood are too common, said Rivas Cruz. In September, she attended a memorial of a 14-year-old who was killed by a reckless driver.“There’s so much death going on,” the Los Angeles Unified School District teacher said from her mother’s living room on a spring afternoon. “The representatives have failed us. Raymond and I were giving back to the community. He was a civil engineer working for the city, and I’m a LAUSD teacher.

    "text": "India aims to detect and predict all small-scale severe weather events through the augmentation of its weather observation network and the procurement of more powerful computing systems, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said on Monday. While launching the yearlong 150th-anniversary celebrations of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Rijiju emphasised that weather and climate impacts are more pronounced than ever, and India strives to become a more climate-resilient country. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel He said that although the IMD's forecast accuracy has improved by 40 per cent in the last five years compared to the preceding five years, challenges persist in predicting small-scale severe weather events such as cloudbursts. To address this challenge, Rijiju highlighted the importance of augmenting the network of doppler radars and automatic weather stations. The procurement of high-power computing systems will enable the IMD to run higher-resolution models, enhancing the ability to detect and predict all small-scale events in the future, he said. \"Everything depends on observations. The more observation capacity we have, the better our forecasting capacity,\" the minister added. The meteorological department has already installed 10 doppler radars in the western Himalayan region and plans to establish 11 radars in the eastern Himalayan region, Rijiju shared. He said India's rapid technological progress has greatly improved the accuracy of weather forecasts and life-saving early warnings, minimising the loss of lives during cyclones, heatwaves, and heavy rain events. Rijiju said that climate change is impacting every sphere of society, with different sectors vulnerable to even small changes in climatic conditions. \"The least developed countries and developing nations are suffering more. We have to become more resilient to climate change and hazards,\" he said. Citing a survey by the National Council of Applied Economic Research, Rijiju said that the IMD's warnings and advisories are assisting farmers and the fishing community in improving their financial status.
