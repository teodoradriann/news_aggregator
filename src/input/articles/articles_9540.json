    "text": "Luis Diaz\nO atacante Luis Diaz é um dos jogadores mais importantes da equipe do Liverpool e vem mostrando uma grande liderança nesta temporada. Ele é titular no lado esquerdo do campo com o técnico Arne Slot e já virou figura cativa na equipe.\nRecentemente, o Barcelona fez contatos e deixou claro a sua intenção em contratá-lo em definitivo. O time acredita que ele faria um encaixe perfeito com o restante do seu sistema ofensivo e fez contatos formais com os seus agentes.\nNesta semana, os Reds decidiram tomar uma decisão definitiva quanto o futuro do jogador colombiano. Eles querem evitar perdê-lo e resolveram entrar em ação para que a sua saída para o Barça seja evitada no final desta temporada europeia.\nLiverpool busca renovação\nO portal Football Insider destaca que o Liverpool está evitando perder Luis Diaz nos próximos meses para o Barcelona. Para que isto não venha a ocorrer, os dirigentes iniciaram conversas para que o jogador renove o seu contrato atual por mais alguns anos.\n(Photo by Marc Atkins/Getty Images)\nAlém de um aumento salarial significativo, o colombiano também ampliaria o seu vínculo com a equipe. Eles acreditam que esta é a melhor forma de evitar que os espanhóis consigam convencê-lo a se transferir na próxima janela de transferências europeia.\nVeja também\nRuben Amorim pede e Manchester United busca a contratação de duas estrelas para o seu ataque\nA fonte indica que as conversas acontecem há alguns meses e tiveram um avanço significativo nas últimas semanas. Diaz está disposto a permanecer no Liverpool e tenta um acordo o mais rápido o possível com os Reds, o que deve ocorrer antes do término da temporada.\nApesar da permanência do ponta-esquerda, o time inglês corre sérios riscos de perder Salah, Arnold e Van Dijk. Os três jogadores tem contrato se encerrando em julho e ainda não receberam nenhum contato para a ampliação do atual vínculo.",

    "text": "A local high school counselor and breast cancer survivor has received the Mystery of the Blue Rose Scholarship for the second consecutive year, helping her pursue her Ph.D. in Educational Leadership. Jessica Bowers, who works as a college and career counselor at Moody High School, was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2020. Now cancer-free, she's continuing her education at Texas A&M University Kingsville with help from the scholarship.\n\"I am a breast cancer survivor. I was diagnosed in October of 2020,\" Bowers said.\nThe Mystery of the Blue Rose Scholarship was founded in 1996 by Gae Callaway, through the Coastal Bend Community Foundation. Callaway started this scholarship one year after losing a friend to breast cancer. Unlike traditional scholarships, this one specifically targets women who are continuing their education later in life, and whose lives have been affected by cancer in some way. The Mystery of the Blue Rose scholarship is typically awarded to students continuing their education at either Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, Texas A&M University Kingsville, Del Mar College, or Coastal Bend College.\n\"It's not for your child out of high school. It is for a female, 35 or older, that's life has somehow been touched by cancer,\" Callaway said.\nBowers received $1,000 in scholarship funds this year, following her $500 award last year as well. The scholarship was able to be larger this year due to more money being raised through fundraisers. She said the financial support has been crucial during her educational journey.\n\"You know, it was very much a dark time, but I was very fortunate to have support throughout this whole ordeal. The fact that I was able to receive these funds was such a blessing,\" Bowers said.\nWhile helping her Moody High School students prepare for college and their careers beyond high school, Bowers is simultaneously advancing her own education, hoping to serve as an inspiration.\n\"You know, I'm hoping that it inspires them as well. You know, to realize that you know, if you set your mind to something, you can accomplish what you need to,\" Bowers said.\nThe scholarship's name carries special significance. A blue rose typically symbolizes mystery and pursuing the impossible, themes that resonated with Callaway when she created the program decades ago.\n\"Well actually I was reading a book, and it had this beautiful blue rose on the front and it just kind of inspired me,\" Callaway said.\nCallaway uses the scholarship to promote all areas of health and well being for women such as physical health, financial health, and spiritual health. Thirty years after it was created, the Mystery of the Blue Rose continues to inspire recipients like Bowers to pursue their educational goals despite facing significant health challenges.\n\"“That was you know, very impactful for me because I was you know, wondering, you know, is this a route that I should take? Should I continue my education? And that sort of inspired me to you know, realize yes, this is something that I needed to do,\" Bowers said.\nCallaway organizes several fundraisers throughout the year to raise money for the Mystery of the Blue Rose scholarships.

    "title": "On Religion: Why Those 'He Gets Us' Ads Keep Triggering Arguments",
    "text": "On Religion: Why Those ‘He Gets Us’ Ads Keep Triggering Arguments\n(ANALYSIS) There is nothing unusual about a photograph of two men embracing at a pride march, surrounded by rainbow flags, banners and New Orleans-style beads.\nBut one of the men in this image from the latest “He Gets Us” Super Bowl advertisement is wearing a John 3:16 hat, as in the Bible verse proclaiming: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”\nMany of the ad's photographs are easy to interpret, such as a man removing “GO BACK” graffiti from a home, a woman helping a weeping man in a grocery store, a firefighter hard at work and a young football player comforting a defeated opponent.\nBut the John 3:16 hat raised the theological stakes in the pride photograph, noted Samuel D. James, an editor active in Christian publishing and founder of the Digital Liturgies Substack.\n“It's obvious one of the goals of 'He Gets Us' is to cut across political and ideological divides,” he wrote in a column for The Gospel Coalition website. “The writers know where the fault lines in American religious culture are — abortion, LGBT+, race, class and so on. And who could resist being moved by these images of human vulnerability and compassion? Who can push out of his or her mind the many moments in the Gospels where Jesus met such needs and taught his followers to do the same?”\nThe ads seek to create “curiosity about and sympathy for Jesus,” he added, with a style targeting an “impressionistic, algorithmic generation.” But there's logic behind the debates triggered by these advertisements. Their content is vague, since the “image-based, music-backed ads lack exposition or annotation; such things would only get in the way of the audience's emotional response.”\nThe pride scene resembles a photograph in the 2024 Super Bowl ad, of a protester “washing the feet of a young woman outside of an abortion clinic,” said James, reached by telephone.\nThere's no way, for example, to know if the patient is entering or leaving the facility.\nMany viewers “will assume that the woman washing the patient's feet has figured it out,” he said. She has “put down her sign and is showing love. ... She has learned something that the other demonstrators have not learned. That's one way to interpret this image. But we don't really know anything about what's happening.”\nThe new Super Bowl spot focused on the question, “What is greatness?” The multimedia \"He Gets Us\" project — which also uses billboards, ads on buses and a variety of online messages — is currently managed by Come Near Inc., a North Carolina nonprofit group.\nThe goal was to invite viewers to “consider the definition of greatness Jesus spoke and modeled,” said Come Near CEO Ken Caldwell in a Crosswalk.com Q&A. “Greatness as defined by our culture — through focusing on wealth, achievement, status and power — is a stark contrast to what Jesus defined as greatness.”\nThat's a worthy goal, wrote James, but it's almost impossible to know what visual images mean in a culture defined by “radical individualism” and a therapeutic approach to life. For many, “He Gets Us” will sound like “a mantra that reinforces the primacy of the self. This mentality keeps my personal psychology at the center, so the question that matters isn't 'What must I do to be saved?' but 'What must you do to affirm me?’”\nWith photographs about abortion, homosexuality and immigration, the ads — intentionally or not — have mixed evangelism with hot-button issues that fuel debates about politics, morality and religion, or all three at the same time, said James.\n“These kinds of images might make sense in a culture in which you have widespread agreement about what 'love' is, what 'sin' is and what it means to turn to Jesus and be ‘saved,'\" he said. \"But there's no way to point people to something that you believe is objectively true in a culture built on images and the emotions they inspire. ... There are messages encoded in these ads, but there's no way to read the code.\n“Different people are going to look at these photographs and see them in different ways. That's kind of the point.”\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION\nTerry Mattingly is Senior Fellow on Communications and Culture at Saint Constantine College in Houston.

    "text": "You deserve clear audio. Summary Distorted audio can result from turning speakers up too high, causing signal clipping or mechanical damage.\nProviding too much power from an amp can overdrive speakers, leading to audio distortion and potential permanent damage.\nThe speaker placement can significantly affect sound quality and cause distortion, especially when placed too close to a wall.\nNobody wants to sit down, put on a movie, and have it sound fuzzy and distorted. Here are some major reasons why your audio might be distorted, and how you can avoid and fix it.\nYou Have the Volume Turned Up Too High\nIf the volume is turned up all the way on your speakers, there's a chance that will cause some audio distortion. You would think that a speaker would only drive as much power as it can handle, but at the highest volume, a lot of speakers will still suffer. Too strong a signal can surpass what the cones inside the speaker drivers can handle, causing audio clipping and distortion.\nJustin Duino / How-To Geek\nThe cause of distortion from high volumes can also be mechanical. You can overheat the speaker by turning it up too high and overpowering it, and you really don't want to fry the inside of your speakers. You can also have the coil inside the driver lose its place and rub against the magnet, causing a scraping noise.\nTo avoid this, don't overwork your speakers with a super high volume. Adjust the placement of your speakers to see if that solves any volume issues you're having that leads to you turning them up too high. If you need louder speakers, rather than suffering through clipping and distorted audio, find speakers that can handle more wattage. More wattage generally correlates with more volume.\nYou're Providing Too Much Power to Your Speakers\nIf you have a dedicated amplifier powering your speakers, you should ideally have an amplifier that has a power rating lower than the maximum wattage of your speakers. However, if the amplifier is more powerful than the speakers can handle,…\nSam Smart",

    "text": "Arsenal 0-2 West Ham: Tomas Soucek in the goals as Mikel Arteta’s side suffer Premier League title setback Arsenal missed the chance to go back top of the Premier League as they succumbed to a shock home defeat to an impressive West Ham side. David Moyes’ men got a goal in each half – from Tomas Soucek and former Gunner Konstantinos Mavropanos respectively – as they pushed themselves up to sixth, above Manchester United. Mikel Arteta threw on Eddie Nketiah and Emile Smith Rowe but to no avail. Arsenal slumped to their first home defeat of the season in the Premier League as Tomas Soucek scored a contentious opening goal to help a well-drilled West Ham earn a 2-0 win – their first victory in the top flight at the Emirates since 2015. Arsenal were denied the chance to return to the top of the table above Liverpool after VAR decided the ball was still in play when West Ham moved ahead against the run of play on 13 minutes. An Emerson cross caused havoc in the home defence as Jarrod Bowen reacted quickest to flick the loose ball back across goal for Soucek to slam into the empty net. A delay of three minutes was needed for referee Michael Oliver before VAR confirmed the goal after failing to find conclusive proof that the ball had gone out, as Bowen set up his team-mate for a fifth league goal of the season. Despite being pressed back for large swathes of the match, West Ham sealed the three points when former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos rose to power a header in off the bar from a James Ward-Prowse corner for his first Premier League goal on 55 minutes. David Raya saved a penalty kick from Said Benrahma at the death after Declan Rice had felled Emerson in injury time, but by then the points were already on their way to East London. David Moyes' side move above Manchester United into sixth in the table, while Arsenal remain two points behind leaders Liverpool at the halfway stage of the campaign. More to follow...

    "text": "The Dallas Cowboys survived three attempts at a late two-point conversion as they held on to beat the Detroit Lions 20-19. The NFC North champion Lions had moved within a point of the Cowboys when Jared Goff found Amon-Ra St Brown for a touchdown pass with 23 seconds remaining. Opting for a two-point conversion, the Lions had a successful attempt ruled out for illegal touching before a Cowboys interception was wiped out for offside. Goff’s final pass attempt was incomplete, lifting the Cowboys to 11-5 as they kept up the pressure on the Philadelphia Eagles in the fight for the NFC east title. A Goff interception had given Brandon Aubrey the chance to kick the Cowboys seven points ahead in the final two minutes, the rookie stretching his record to 35 successful field goals to start his career. Dak Prescott threw for 345 yards and two touchdowns for the Cowboys, including a 92-yard effort to CeeDee Lamb in the first quarter.

    "text": "Fall is my favorite season for various reasons, one being that there are so many cute fall activities you could do. Here’s a list of fun fall festivities that are on my fall bucket list!\nPaint a Pumpkin\nPainting a pumpkin for Halloween is super cute and fun to do! I’ve already done this so I could check it off my list, but using fall colors to paint a pumpkin is a fun activity to do!\nCarve a Pumpkin\nYou can get really creative while carving a pumpkin and it could be anything cute or spooky!\nBake Halloween Cookies\nBuying ready-to-bake cookies that are Halloween-themed is always a cute fall activity to do and goes great with my next point!\nWatch Spooky Movies\nAfter you make your spooky cookies, you could watch a spooky movie and or a fall show/movie since there are so many out there! My favorite Halloween movie is “The Nightmare Before Christmas”.\nHave Fall Photoshoots\nThere are so many options for cute fall pictures. I use Pinterest to help me think of what pictures I want to take!\nHave a Bonfire/S’mores Night\nWhat a perfect time to have a bonfire. Being huddled up by a fire on a nice fall night and just making s’mores is such a fall vibe.\nRead a Suspenseful Book\nI never read anything but romance novels, so this fall I bought two books: “Too Late” by Colleen Hoover and “Wrong Place Wrong Time” by Gillian McAllister. I’m excited to read both this October!\nFall Picnic/Painting\nI usually paint during the summertime, but how cute would it be to sit outside and have a cute fall picnic and paint something using fall colors only?\nCollect Leaves\nAn easy way to appreciate the fall time is by collecting leaves! Super random, but how cute would it be to go on a leaves scavenger hunt and collect leaves of all colors and put them in a scrapbook or tape them inside a journal?\nNature Walk\nGoing on a nature walk during fall really allows you to take in the weather and the change of the season!\nTry Fall Drinks\nCoffee shops come up with such cute fall drinks so why not go out and try them? I just love all the different options there are for fall",

    "text": "Workers stage a protest to demand higher wages and recognition of their union, at Samsung India's plant in Sriperumbudur, near Chennai on September 11, 2024. R.satish Babu | Afp | Getty ImagesShares of Samsung Electronics fell as much as 3% on Friday, as workers at its southern Indian plant continued to strike, disrupting production at the consumer electronics unit for a fifth day.Worker union's representatives, Samsung's management and the state's labor officials failed to reach an agreement over pay and working conditions among other things, on Thursday. Hundreds of workers have been on strike since Monday, demanding the electronics conglomerate to recognize their union, raise wages and reduce working hours. It is one of the biggest such strikes in recent years in India, Reuters reported. The plant, located in the city of Chennai in southern India, makes electronic appliances including televisions, refrigerators and washing machines.It's one of the two factories that Samsung runs in India and can account for up to 30% of the group's $12 billion annual revenue in the country, Reuters reported.Samsung Electronics is one of the leading players in India's smartphone and electronic appliances market. The major appliances sector-wide 2024 revenue in India is pegged at $38.2 billion, according to Statista.The workers will continue to strike until their demands for better wages and working conditions are met, union leader E. Muthukumar told Reuters, \"Samsung management asked us to stop striking but wouldn't recognize the union or talk to us, so the strike continues.\" Around 85% of the 1,700 workers at the plant were part of the strike, local newspaper Business Standards reported on Tuesday. A Samsung spokesperson said in a statement earlier this week that the company \"actively engages with our workers to address any grievances they may have and comply with all laws and regulations. We will also ensure that there is no disruption to our consumers.\" The strike in Samsung India follows recent wage protests in South Korea where 36,500 members from its biggest workers' union went on strike in July and August, calling for higher wages and better benefits. Shares of Samsung Electronics listed in South Korea's stock exchange have dropped over 6% so far this week, LSEG data showed.
