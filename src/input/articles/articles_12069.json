    "text": "Preparing for change in a well-established, well-capitalized industry is not easy.\nSuch is the story for ticker symbol BYND, formally known as Beyond Meat (BYND) in supermarket aisles across the US.\nWhile Beyond Meat's stock price has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown has not. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry executive is focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n“We believe the cycle of history is in our favor and we're going to turn it into long-term success,” Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above). ,\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business.\nBeyond Meat burst onto investors' radar with a spectacular initial public offering on Nasdaq on May 5, 2019.\nInvestors gobbled up shares of a company they viewed as a leader in the emerging plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 per share, opened for trading at $46 and then rose to $65.75 by the close. Profit at the closing bell: a delicious 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite on May 2, 2019 in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\nFrom there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, including big deals with global restaurant chains like Yum! The brand is planning expansion into the refrigerated food sections of retailers such as KFC and Dunkin' Donuts (YUM), Target (TGT) and overseas, and efforts are underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items. Are.\nBy July 2019, Beyond Meat shares reached a peak of $234.90 per share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the restaurant industry, and its financial impact sent people turning back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat's impressive momentum has stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including rival Impossible Foods.\nAdditionally, attacks from strong parties in the meat industry and media on the healthfulness of plant-based items have damaged Beyond Meat's standing with consumers. By November 2022, as losses hit cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its employees.\nThen in November this year, Beyond Meat – which has cut prices to stimulate demand – said it would cut 19% of its non-production workforce after a lower-than-expected third quarter.\nThird-quarter sales fell 8.7% from a year earlier to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million based on adjusted operating profit.\n“You know there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and especially after the IPO,” Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round. “It was going to happen overnight.” Retrenchment. “This has clearly not been proven to be the case.”\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: surround yourself with great people, take a long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course.\n“But the reason we started this company and the reason consumers are reaching out to a product is getting stronger day by day, whether it's the health aspect, whether it's climate, whether it's energy and Whether it's water use or animal welfare,” Brown added. , “All of those issues are becoming serious, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.”\nToday, Beyond Meat's stock is trading at $8.95 per share – well below its staggering post-IPO high. According to comparative data from Yahoo Finance, the company has a market cap of $577.6 million, while Meat King Tyson (TSN) has a market cap of $18.46 billion.\n“In terms of the reasons for the softening in the US, it's pretty much the same: consumers continue to shy away from the category for a number of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or lack thereof),” said JPMorgan packaged foods analyst Kane. Are included.” Goldman said.\nGoldman has given Beyond Meat shares an underweight rating, which is equivalent to a sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat Founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) inside their new El Segundo, California headquarters about the path forward for the plant-based meat company. (Yahoo Finance)\nBrown, meanwhile, is focused on dismissing the critics. Beyond Meat recently opened a massive 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, California, just steps away from the headquarters of Barbie maker Mattel (MAT). The space is equipped with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a typically open floor plan that could herald the next big thing in plant-based dining.\nThe new facility also features a McDonald's (MCD) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 tall Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often walks around the building to interact with staff with his trademark calm, welcoming atmosphere.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won't be easy and he's not in the mindset to consider the business path forward yet at this point. But he will not shy away from his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and passion.\n“I want to see [my mission] Until completion,” Brown said. ''I think it would be something [that] When it's all said and done, I'll look back. But I'm in a fight right now, so it's hard to watch.”\nbrian sozzi is the executive editor of Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Phnom Penh, December 12 (ZXS) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said here on December 29 that Cambodia's \"win-win policy\" has brought peace, stability and development to the country over the past 29 years, benefiting Cambodia, its surrounding regions and other countries in the world. On the same day, Cambodia held a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the \"win-win policy\" and the 5th anniversary of the establishment of the win-win monument in the capital Phnom Penh. This year's celebration will run from December 12 to 29. In 1998, then-Prime Minister Hun Sen proposed a \"win-win policy\" that ended Cambodia's civil war that lasted for more than 20 years. The above-mentioned \"win-win policy\" mainly includes three major connotations: ensuring the safety of people's lives, ensuring that people live and work in peace and contentment, and protecting people's property rights. Hun Manet called on the people to cherish the hard-won peace. He said the win-win monument is a symbol of peace and a symbol of history, and it reminds the younger generation of Cambodians to remember the historical fact that the country pursues peace. Hun Manet said that the end of the Cambodian civil war will help strengthen regional peace and promote the settlement of international affairs. Cambodia has always been committed to playing its role in maintaining regional stability, and has sent nearly 10,000 troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations and provided humanitarian demining training courses to war-torn countries. Local media reported that the \"win-win policy\" has led Cambodia to prosperity, rapid development of all walks of life, and great achievements in national construction. It is believed that under the leadership of the new government, Cambodia will achieve its goal of becoming a high-income country by 2050 and its people will live a happy and happy life. (ENDS)",

    "text": "When an Indonesian mother dropped off her daughter at school in May, she did not expect her to become violently sick after eating lunch from the government's new billion-dollar free meal programme.\n\"My daughter had a stomachache, diarrhoea, and a headache,\" the woman told AFP on condition of anonymity about the incident in the Javan city of Bandung.\n\"She also couldn't stop vomiting until three in the morning.\"\nIndonesian President Prabowo Subianto touted the populist scheme as a solution to the high rates of stunted growth among children, as he carved his way to a landslide election victory last year.\nBut its rollout since January has stumbled from crisis to crisis, including accusations of nepotism, funding delays, protests and a spate of food poisonings.\nIt was slated to reach as many as 17.5 million children this year to the tune of $4.3 billion.\nBut so far it has only served five million students nationwide from January to mid-June, according to the finance ministry.\nThe poisoning issues were not isolated to that girl's school -- five others reported similar incidents.\nBut Prabowo has lauded the number of illnesses as a positive.\n\"Indeed there was a poisoning today, around 200 people out of three million,\" he said in May.\n\"Over five were hospitalised, so that means the success rate is 99.99 percent. A 99.99 percent success rate in any field is a good thing.\"\n- Rushed policy - Large-scale aid programmes in Indonesia have a history of allegations of graft at both the regional and national levels.\nExperts say this programme is particularly vulnerable, with little in the way of accountability.\n\"A big budget means the possibility of corruption is wide open, and with lax monitoring, corruption can happen,\" said Egi Primayogha, a researcher at Indonesia Corruption Watch.\n\"Since the beginning, the programme was rushed, without any good planning. There is no transparency.\"\nThe programme was rolled out soon after Prabowo took office in October and local investigative magazine Tempo reported that \"several partners appointed\" were Prabowo supporters in the election.\nAgus Pambagio, a Jakarta-based public policy expert, said Prabowo rushed the plan, with critics saying there was little public consultation.\n\"Japan and India have been doing it for decades. If we want to do it just like them within a few months, it's suicide,\" he said.\n\"We can't let fatalities happen.\"\nThe plan's stated aim is to combat stunting, which affects more than 20 percent of the country's children, and reduce that rate to five percent by 2045.\nPrabowo's administration has allocated $0.62 per meal and initially set a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) for this year.\nBut authorities have been accused of delays and under-funding the programme.\nA catering business in capital Jakarta had to temporarily shut down in March because the government had not paid the $60,000 it was owed. The case went viral and it eventually got its money back.\n- Poses risks - The government announced a $6.2 billion budget boost recently but revised it by half as problems mounted in its ambitious quest to deliver meals to almost 83 million people by 2029.\nWidespread cuts to fund the programme's large budget also sparked protests across Indonesian cities in February.\nYet some say the programme has benefited their child.\n\"It's quite helpful. I still give my son pocket money, but since he got free lunch, he could save that money,\" Reni Parlina, 46, told AFP.\nHowever a May survey by research institute Populix found more than 83 percent of 4,000 respondents think the policy should be reviewed.\n\"If necessary, the programme should be suspended until a thorough evaluation is carried out,\" said Egi.\nThe National Nutrition Agency, tasked with overseeing free meal distribution, did not respond to an AFP request for comment.\nThe agency has said it will evaluate the scheme and has trained thousands of kitchen staff.\nKitchen partners say they are taking extra precautions too.\n\"We keep reminding our members to follow food safety protocols,\" said Sam Hartoto of the Indonesian Catering Entrepreneurs Association, which has 100 members working with the government.\nWhile they seek to provide assurances, the debacles have spooked parents who doubt Prabowo's government can deliver.\n\"I don't find this programme useful. It poses more risks than benefits,\" said the mother of the sick girl.\n\"I don't think this programme is running well.\"\ndsa/jfx/dhw/dhc\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Partners/afp Recommended for you Currently in Bangor\n67° 86° / 67° 3 AM 65° 4 AM 65° 5 AM 64° 6 AM 65° 7 AM 68° Storm Cancellations\nSubmit Cancellations Here Trending Videos What's on Tonight?

    "title": "Teddy Atlas claims Mike Tyson is not one of boxing's all-time greats in recent interview | Marca",
    "text": "F or the majority of boxing fans, Mike Tyson has been one of the greatest to ever do it in the Heavyweight division. Although he didn't last that long at the very top when he was a champion, there was a time in which he was the most feared man on the planet. In fact, there hasn't been another fighter everybody in the division feels absolutely terrified to fight as it happened with Mike . You could see opponents' eyes when they stepped inside a ring with him, they were scared out of their minds. But that fear didn't last for too long and even one of his trainers doesn't think Mike as one of the all-time greats. Surely many would disagree with this take. This trainer's name is Teddy Atlas and he was part of the first group of trainers the legendary boxer had during his career.\nMike Tyson delivers a profound message to those in search of life's meaning Roberto Ortega Teddy Atlas on Mike Tyson's greatness During a recent episode of the Lex Fridman Podcast, Teddy Atlas explained the reason he doesn't think Mike Tyson is one of the greats. Here's part of what he said: \"I don't know if he was ever great. I know he was sensational. I know he was the greatest mix of maybe speed and power ever. I know he was one of the greatest punchers from either side of the plate, left or right. There's been great punchers with just the right hand like Earnie Shavers and Deontay Wilder and Max Baer. I don't know if there's ever been anyone who could punch as good as (Tyson) did on either side with either hand other than Joe Louis and a few others.\"\nAtlas added: \"I don't know if there's ever been such a combination of speed and power to that pure level that he had, and it was a pure level. I don't know if there was ever as good a fighter as Tyson was for maybe one night he was great. He wasn't tested, but he might have been ready to be tested that one night against Michael Spinks when he took him apart in 90 seconds. I think I saw a great fighter that night. I don't think you can be great unless you have all the requirements of being great.\"",

    "text": "A severe heatwave in Australia is forecast for the weekend. Image via Australia Bureau of Meteorology . Even though summer in Australia doesn’t start until next week (with the solstice ), millions of Australians are expecting a severe heatwave starting this weekend and into the coming week. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology defines a heatwave as:\n… When the maximum and minimum temperatures are unusually hot over 3 days.\nIn this case, winds from the north have produced a dry, hot air mass, expected to move from the interior to the eastern and southeastern parts of Australia in the coming days. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology says the heatwave is expected to develop from Canberra (Australia’s capital, inland from the country’s southeast coast) up toward Darwin (in Australia’s Northern Territory) as early as Saturday, December 14.\nHeatwave warnings are in effect for the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. See the map above.\nHeat waves and hot weather have caused more deaths in Australia than any other disaster, according to the Australian Red Cross . When the Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses the term severe heatwave , like what’s expected this weekend into next week, it’s talking about an event that isn’t common at this time of year. Heatwaves pose the most risk to the elderly, children, and those with medical issues. Heatwave tips from the Red Cross here .\nSevere heatwave in Australia: Temps As an example of what to expect, in Australia’s capital of Canberra, the forecast highs are:\nSaturday, December 14: 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit)\nSunday, December 15: 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit)\nMonday, December 16: 39 Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit)\nSee weather forecasts for Canberra here and here .\nHeat preparedness The Australian Bureau of Meteorology as well as the Australian Red Cross encourage residents to prepare for a heatwave before it happens. They suggest speaking to doctors and caregivers to see how heat will impact you, or any medications you may be taking.\nThe Bureau also stresses to do what you can to stay cool, including purchasing fans, making sure air conditioning is working properly. Here are some tips for seniors (and others) on what to do if your power goes out during a heatwave . Many cities now have established “cooling centers.” Look for one if your power goes out when temperatures are high. The Australian Red Cross also has a number of suggestions on heatwaves and hot weather .\nForecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology suggest the temperature will cool off and become more seasonal by the end of the coming week.\nSydney. Image via Openverse . Nighttime temps are important, too An important factor in heatwave definitions is that unusually hot minimum temperatures are typically included as well.\nThe body recovers from the heat of the day by cooling off overnight, but if nighttime temperatures stay warm, the body can’t recover as easily. That not only stresses the body out when it should be recovering, but means it isn’t properly prepared for the next day’s heat.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology uses a metric called the Excess Heat Factor, or EHF, to help organize heatwaves into different levels. The EHF uses not just the average temperatures for the period of the heatwave (at least three days) but also the actual temperatures from the past 30 days. This allows the meteorologists to determine how much stress a person’s body will deal with when the heat sets in.\nBottom line: Heatwave warnings are in effect for the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria.\nVia Australia Bureau of Meteorology\nAustralian Red Cross",
